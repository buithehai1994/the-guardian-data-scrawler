The proposed Rosebank development was given the go-ahead in 2023 but was ruled unlawful by a court last week.The energy secretary, Ed Miliband, has previously described the licence issued to Rosebank as “climate vandalism” – setting up a potential major clash between his department and the Treasury.Reeves is understood to be supportive of a new application for environmental consent, with allies suggesting that would not violate Labour’s manifesto, which promised not to issue new exploration licences, but not to cancel ones that have already been issued.Miliband’s department is due to publish new guidelines in late spring which could scupper any attempt by the oil companies to successfully resubmit their applications.Climate-concerned MPs are likely to make their appeals directly to Keir Starmer about the importance of being seen to stand by the party’s manifesto commitment of no new oil and gas licences.Anger is widespread even among centrist Labour MPs who have been major champions of infrastructure.It is understood the Labour Growth Group – a large influential caucus of mostly new Labour MPs who have pushed hard on announcements on housing and infrastructure – will not take a position backing Rosebank. The group did give its backing to Heathrow expansion which was announced by Reeves last week.MPs said more criticism would be forthcoming if approval was being pushed by the Treasury. “This is absolutely a line in the sand for almost everyone in the PLP. This goes specifically against what we said we were about,” one MP said.“This would be a breaking point for a lot of us,” another MP said. A third said: “We have to send a signal to workers, not just oil giants, that we know what [energy] transition really means. If we don’t build up domestic supply chains and manufacturing for renewables, oil workers will have nowhere to go. They won’t thank us for that.”A fourth Labour MP said it was important to make the case that new oilfields should not be seen as an automatic growth advantage. “You’re banking on what could potentially very quickly become stranded assets, and the profits go to private companies but it’s the public sector that will end up clearing up the mess.“That is not a good investment and I think there are some of my colleagues that sort of think that all growth is good and that’s actually economically illiterate.“The new intake are very clear. If Trump is closing his door on green investment, we should be opening the door to green investment. The Americans are going to miss out. We don’t want to.”The backlash against Rosebank would be “much much bigger” than on Heathrow, another MP said. “It says a worrying thing about our political strategy,” they said. “There was a quite clear line on all of this stuff. And then if you get panicked just by a couple of headlines in the Daily Mail, then that as a narrative feels a bit worrying.”“They can hold the line that you can make electric planes but digging up a tonne of oil really isn’t anything other than environmental vandalism,” another MP agreed. “Rosebank is fundamentally a disaster.”Five Labour MPs, including three who chair different all-party parliamentary groups on climate and renewable energy, wrote a letter to the Times on Monday, criticising the automatic link made between new oil fields and economic growth – with a veiled reminder of Labour’s green electoral platform.“Labour’s mandate is clear: the country wants a decisive shift toward a future with cleaner, more secure energy,” it said, signed by Luke Murphy, Polly Billington and Alex Sobel, Peter Swallow and Abtisam Mohamed.Another member of the climate APPG, MP Uma Kumaran, tweeted after the ruling: “Britain’s future lies in clean energy, not more oil and gas.Former shadow ministers Sarah Champion and Barry Gardiner both said the government must rule out any further development. “Approving the Rosebank operation is simply not compatible with our climate goals,” Champion said. Gardiner said it was a test whether the chancellor was “willing to abide by her manifesto commitment”.Two other key factors will be the view of Scottish Labour and the GMB trade union who are pushing hard for the development to be approved. A significant number of cabinet ministers are members of GMB.Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar has hinted he expects the government to honour the previous commitment to grant the licence – but a number of new Scottish Labour MPs are opposed.The Rosebank row opens Scottish Labour to criticism from all sides, as seen on Monday when voices from across the political spectrum in Scotland attacked Starmer’s “broken promises” after the new boss of GB Energy, Jürgen Maier, admitted in his first broadcast interview the prime minister’s pledge of 1,000 jobs for Aberdeencould take 20 years.Miliband’s guidelines will be the result of a consultation into how emissions caused by the burning of oil and gas extracted from energy projects will be accounted and allowed for in planning applications, stemming from thelandmark Horse Hill judgmenthanded down last year. Oil and gas companies are lobbying for a looser interpretation.Tessa Khan, founder of climate campaign group Uplift, which brought the case against Rosebank, said she was confident the guidance would preclude the new oilfields. She said: “We think the climate case against Rosebank is watertight – there is just no way you can accept we are in a climate emergency and approve a massive new oilfield.”Explore more on these topicsLabourKeir StarmerOil (Business)Oil (Environment)EnergynewsShareReuse this content"

In 2022, about 2.5 million people were diagnosed with the disease. But the patterns of incidence by subtype have changed dramatically in recent decades.Of the four main subtypes of lung cancer (adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, small-cell carcinoma and large-cell carcinoma), adenocarcinoma has become the dominant subtype among both men and women,the IARC found.Adenocarcinoma accounted for 45.6% of global lung cancer cases among men and 59.7% of global lung cancer cases among women in 2022. The respective figures were 39.0% and 57.1% in 2020.Adenocarcinoma accounts for as much as 70% of lung cancer cases among never-smokers, the IARC said.While lung cancer incidence rates for men have generally decreased in most countries during the past 40 years, rates among women have tended to continue to rise.Current trends suggest that while men still make up most lung cancer cases (about 1.6 million in 2022), the gap between lung cancer incidences in males and females is narrowing, with about 900,000 women diagnosed with lung cancer in 2022.In 2023,the Guardian revealedhow the number of women diagnosed with lung cancer in the UK was overtaking men for the first time, prompting calls for women to be as vigilant about it as they are about breast cancer.Cancer experts said the figures reflected historical differences in smoking prevalence, specifically that smoking rates peaked much earlier in men than women. Women should now be as alert to potential lung cancer signs as they were about checking for lumps in their breasts, they said.Changes in cigarette manufacturing and smoking patterns in recent decades have influenced the trends in lung cancer incidence by subtype, and there isaccumulating evidenceof a causal link between air pollution and an increased risk of adenocarcinoma, the IARC said.It is not known what proportion of global lung cancer cases are in never-smokers, only that evidence suggests it is rising. Scientists are racing to learn more about what else is causing lung cancer, beyond smoking.“Air pollution can be considered an important factor that partly explains the emerging predominance of adenocarcinoma that accounts for 53% to 70% of cases of lung cancer among people who have never smoked worldwide,” the study reported.Bray said the study provided important insights as to how both lung cancer and the underlying risk factors were evolving, “offering clues as to how we can optimally prevent lung cancer worldwide”.He added: “Changes in smoking patterns and exposure to air pollution are among the main determinants of the changing risk profile of lung cancer incidence by subtype that we see today.“The diverging trends by sex in recent generations offer insights to cancer prevention specialists and policymakers seeking to develop and implement tobacco and air pollution control strategies tailored to high-risk populations.”Explore more on these topicsLung cancerCancerAir pollutionHealthMedical researchWorld Health OrganizationSmokingnewsShareReuse this content"

NHSE have thus far refused.”An NHSE spokesperson said: “Independent mental health homicide reports are commissioned by NHS England and published in line with the requirements of confidentiality and data protection legislation relating to patient information.”Explore more on these topicsNottinghamMental healthnewsShareReuse this content"

The paper argues that conscious AI systems could be built in the near future – or at least ones that give the impression of being conscious.“It may be the case that large numbers of conscious systems could be created and caused to suffer,” the researchers say, adding that if powerful AI systems were able to reproduce themselves it could lead to the creation of “large numbers of new beings deserving moral consideration”.The paper, written by Oxford University’s Patrick Butlin and Theodoros Lappas of the Athens University of Economics and Business, adds that even companies not intending to create conscious systems will need guidelines in case of “inadvertently creating conscious entities”.It acknowledges that there is widespread uncertainty and disagreement over defining consciousness in AI systems and whether it is even possible, but says it is an issue that “we must not ignore”.Other questions raised by the paper focus on what to do with an AI system if it is defined as a “moral patient” – an entity that matters morally “in its own right, for its own sake”. In that scenario, it questions if destroying the AI would be comparable to killing an animal.The paper, published in the Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, also warned that a mistaken belief that AI systems are already conscious could lead to a waste of political energy as misguided efforts are made to promote their welfare.The paper and letter were organised by Conscium, a research organisation part-funded by WPP and co-founded by WPP’s chief AI officer, Daniel Hulme.Last year agroup of senior academicsargued there was a “realistic possibility” that some AI systems will be conscious and “morally significant” by 2035.In 2023, Sir Demis Hassabis, the head of Google’s AI programme and a Nobel prize winner, said AI systems were “definitely” not sentient currently but could be in the future.“Philosophers haven’t really settled on a definition of consciousness yet but if we mean sort of self-awareness, these kinds of things, I think there’s a possibility AI one day could be,” he said in an interview with US broadcaster CBS.Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)EthicsStephen FrynewsShareReuse this content"

It is estimated that domestic catskill 27 million birds in the UK each year.View image in fullscreenA report suggested the Scottish government look further into ‘containing’ cat ownership in certain areas but a national ban was not mentioned.Photograph: John Eveson/AlamyThis morphed online into the unfounded claim that the Scottish government was to ban cats completely, which the first minister,John Swinney, was forced to deny.The story quickly gained traction. The former Labour shadow chancellor Ed Balls expressed his shock on Good Morning Britain and asked: “Has the world gone mad?”A clearly exasperated Swinney clarified to Bauer Radio on Monday afternoon: “There’s a report being produced by an external organisation, which has come into the government for consideration. Let me just clear this up today. The government’s not going to be banning cats or restricting cats. We have no intention of doing so and we’ll not be doing it.”The commission’s report refers to other jurisdictions where restrictions on cat ownership exist in order to protect local wildlife, ranging from “keeping cats indoors at all times, to allowing them outside only during the day, or only on a leash, or in a secure outdoor run”. But it goes on to acknowledgepreventing free access to the outdoors has a significant impact on feline welfare.Ultimately it suggests that “new housing developments in rural areas could have a stipulation that cats may not be kept in conservation-sensitive areas/other areas that have not had high levels of predation, especially with red-listed or amber-listed birds/other species”.Asked about the proposals and if the UK government might follow suit, Keir Starmer’s spokesperson expressed some puzzlement. “I don’t think we have any plans to ban people from owning cats,” the spokesperson said. When told the policy was just about only allowing cats outside on leads, they added: “No plans for leads.”Alice Palombo of the charityCatsProtection told the Mail on Sunday, which published the original article on the mooted cat ban, that these “highly independent animals” did not like to be restrained on a lead and could suffer stress-related problems if kept permanently indoors.Explore more on these topicsScottish politicsJohn SwinneyEndangered speciesAnimal welfareConservationCatsAnimalsnewsShareReuse this content"

The agency was set up after Labour’s general election win, with the decision made last year to headquarter it in Aberdeen – the oil and gas capital of Europe – and the ambition of cutting costs for consumers.Maier said the Labour-backed organisation would create 200 to 300 roles in Aberdeen over the next five years.He told Sky News: “In the very long term, as we become a major energy champion, it may be many more [jobs] than that. Energy companies grow over 10 or 20 years. We are going to be around in 20 years as a British energy champion.”Asked if it could take 20 years to get to 1,000 jobs, he responded: “Absolutely.”Maier, a former chief executive of machine industry firm Siemens UK, highlighted there would also be thousands of jobs created in the wider renewable energy supply chain through the activities of GB Energy.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

People were promised lower fuel bills because of GB Energy. The chair of GB Energy told the media this morning that won’t be realised for some considerable time to come.”Scottish Tory leader Russell Findlay said: “Prior to the election, they couldn’t even tell us what GB Energy was going to be, other than a plaque on a building in Aberdeen.“It now turns out that Keir Starmer will be 80 years old before they employ the number of people they say it is going to employ, but I would even take that with a gigantic pinch of salt.”Explore more on these topicsEnergy industryRenewable energyEnergynewsShareReuse this content"

On Monday Trump announceda one-month “pause”in the threatened tariffs after conversations with his Mexican counterpart, Claudia Sheinbaum, and the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau. But much uncertainty remains.Here are five charts outlining what is at stake for the EU and the UK.Trump is targeting a large goods deficit with the EUBalance of trade chartThe US is the largest goods importer in the world – buying products worth$3tn (£2.4tn) in 2023. It also has the largest trade in goods deficit – when imports exceed exports – worth $1tn.Trump has long complained about the deficit as a sign of “unfair” trade practices being used by the US’s trading partners, and sees it as a sign of weakness in the US economy after decades of factory production shifting overseas.The US’s largest trade in goods deficit with a single country is with China, worth $279bn in 2023. This was followed by the EU, at $208bn. However, taking account of services trade significantly reduces the deficit with the EU, because of large volumes of transatlantic trade in financial services, intellectual property and other professional sectors.The UK has a more balanced relationship with the US. The US is Britain’s largest single export market, worth £60.4bn in goods in 2023, accounting for 15.3% of the global total. The UK imported £57.9bn in goods from the US.View image in fullscreenThe US is the UK’s largest single export market.Photograph: Paul White/Transport Infrastructures/AlamyServices trade is significantly larger, worth £126.3bn in exports from the UK to the US and £57.4bn in imports.In a quirk caused by differences in data collection,the US and the UK report trade surpluseswith one another. The UK reported a £71.4bn surplus with the US in 2023, while the US reported one worth £11.6bn with the UK.Ireland and Germany have the largest US trade relationships in the EUTrading partners chartShould Trump impose tariffs on the EU, some countries are likely to be hit harder than others. Germany has by far the most goods exports, worth €158bn (£131bn) in 2023. The Netherlands imports the most goods from the US, worth €76bn.However, the proportion of exports to the US relative to total trade alsovaries significantlybetween EU member states. Ireland has by far the largest share, at more than 25%. Germany and Italy’s trade with the US is worth about 10% of their global totals, while east European nations have lower shares.On trade, the EU takes collective action. Emmanuel Macron hassaid the bloc will stand up for itselfif it is targeted. The UK now negotiates alone after Brexit. Keir Starmer has sought to build ties with both camps, and Trump has signalled a deal can be “worked out” with the UK.Some economists are optimistic about the UK’s prospects as a result, but others warn Starmer will be faced with unmeetable trade-offs.Cars, chemicals and medicines are the biggest EU and UK exports to the USTop commodities chartShould blanket tariffs on EU and UK goods be imposed by the US, the most heavily exposed sectors would include the region’s car manufacturers, chemicals firms and pharmaceutical companies.Machinery and transport equipment is the largest sector for goods exports, worth more than £200bn combined between the UK and the EU in 2023, led by Germany, the region’s dominant manufacturing force. With substantial operations in Mexico, Germany’s car manufacturers are already facing a substantial hit.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Should Trump expand his trade war to involve more countries, and should they retaliate, there could be wider global inflationary consequences, and a hit to global growth.The National Institute of Economic and Social Research, a UK thinktank, estimates a 10% tariff on all US imports – with retaliation from trading partners – couldreduce global growth by about 1%over the next two years. UK growth could also be dragged down by up to 0.7 percentage points in the first year, while inflation would be 3 to 4 points higher, and interest rates would be 2 to 3 points higher.However, tariffs could be disinflationary depending on how the trade war unfolds. Weaker global growth could cool inflationary pressures, while economists have said huge US tariffs on China alone couldlead to lower prices in other countriesbecause Chinese companies could respond by trying to find alternative buyers.Higher borrowing costs are causing a headache for governmentsBond costs chartBorrowing costs for governments have risen sharply in recent months amid investor fears over Trump’s tariffs stoking inflation. The rise in the yield – in effect the interest rate – on government bonds has caused a headache for several nations with high levels of debt, including the UK and France.From a low of about 3.9% in September, the yield on US 30-year Treasury bonds has risen to above 4.7%. In the UK, borrowing costs have risen over that time from 4.3% to 5.1%.For the UK government, that presents the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, with a dilemma before her spring statement on 26 March. Analysts warn that sustained higher borrowing costs couldbreak her fiscal rules.After Trump’s weekend announcement, bond yields fell as investors rushed to sell riskier shares in favour of safer assets. However, analysts said a tough trade-off is emerging: yields could be pushed higher by central banks holding interest rates at higher levels, but may be dragged lower if tariffs hit economic growth, forcing central banks to cut borrowing costs.Explore more on these topicsInternational tradeEconomicsGlobal economyDonald TrumpEuropean UnionEuropeexplainersShareReuse this content"

Photograph: Armin Durgut/APWith student-led activists reluctant to engage politically against well-entrenched regime, many are asking: now what?ByJulian Borgerin Novi SadMon 3 Feb 2025 09.00 ESTShareWhen Serbian protesterstook over the town of Novi Sadthis weekend and staged a triumphant street festival, occasional chants could be heard of an old slogan dating back a quarter of a century.“Gotov je!”(“He’s finished!”) was the mantra of the 2000 revolt that brought down Serbia’s post-communist dictator Slobodan Milošević. This time it was aimed at his successor, President Aleksandar Vučić, but the chant did not travel far among the tens of thousands gathered in Novi Sad.The words were from another era and the students who have led the past three months of protests have no real interest in a change of leadership, arguing they have no confidence that the existing political system would produce anyone better. They are not pointing out the emperor has no clothes, they say, only to end up with a new emperor.“We need to rebuild everything from scratch,” said Ana Ðurović, a film-making student, standing in the midst of a dense, jubilant crowd on one of the three bridges across the Danube blocked by protesters as evening fell on Saturday. “Students are not trying to participate in politics or government. That’s not the plan.”1:01Tens of thousands rally against Serbian government in student-led protests – video reportWith the students reluctant to get involved in conventional politics against a well-entrenched regime, there is a troubling question hanging over the euphoria of the protests: now what?Serbian democrats have reason to be cautious. Milošević’s democratic successor, Zoran Đinđić, held office as prime minister for little more than two years before beingshot through the heartby a sniper, a special forces veteran taking orders from organised crime.The trigger for the latest protests has been more bloodshed: the lives of 15 people lost when the canopy roof outside Novi Sad railway stationcollapsed on 1 November, amid evidence of slipshod construction, fraud and corruption.For the protesters there is a common strand: what is rotten in Serbia’s body politic has once again ended up killing its own citizens. The emblem of the protests has become a scarlet palm print, depicting the bloody hands of those in power.The students’ strategy is to focus on the Novi Sad station disaster with specific demands for transparency and accountability, and their hope is their dogged insistence on those two scarce commodities will somehow change Serbia.View image in fullscreenA drone view of the protests in Novi Sad on Saturday, during which demonstrators blocked three bridges in the city.Photograph: Đorđe Kojadinović/Reuters“If they do every single thing that students want from the government, we will have a total change in our society, because they will have to start arresting people at the top of government,” said Ivan Bjelić, an activist who has spent 23 days in jail for his part in the demonstrations.The protests have so far wrongfooted Vučić and his Serbian Progressive party (SNS), who had grown adept over more than a decade at sidelining the conventional political opposition, through a mix of government patronage and the threats of character assassination through friendly tabloids, dismissal or financial pressure.The students have kept their distance from the opposition parties and operate collectively through plenary meetings and direct democracy, with no identifiable leaders the government can target. And with each tabloid denunciation or sporadic physical attack, including two car-ramming incidents, the protests have grown.‘We are done with corruption’: how the students of Serbia rose up against the systemRead more“It’s really very challenging for this government, because they don’t know how to talk with these young people who are just asking for justice and for truth,” said Srdan Golubović, a celebrated Serbian film director and one of Ðurović’s professors from the University of Belgrade.Golubović and most of the dramatic arts faculty were standing with the students on one of the Novi Sad bridges on Saturday. He compared the protests to the mass uprisings of 1968, in their student leadership, the emphasis on direct democracy and systemic change, as well as their sheer scale.“This started as something small but it has become a big wave, as many people from all the cities and small towns in Serbia are no longer afraid. That’s the most important thing – the loss of fear,” Golubović said.The students’ broadening base of support was evident over a sunlit weekend in Novi Sad. Local farmers brought dozens of tractors, deployed as brightly coloured steel guardians on the bridges and city streets. Serbia’s biker community arrived on thousands of motorcycles that entered in dramatic style on Saturday afternoon, in one long cavalcade escorted by smiling police. Meanwhile, army veterans marched in their crimson berets through the city centre to pay their respects at the damaged railway station.View image in fullscreenThe broadening base of support for the protesters was evident in Novi Sad on Saturday.Photograph: Đorđe Kojadinović/ReutersThere have now been protests in about 200 towns. In the run-up to the weekend’s events, Belgrade students walked the 60 miles (100km) to Novi Sad through traditionally SNS-loyalist villages and were feted all along the way. A fleet of taxis from Belgrade turned up on Sunday to offer them free rides back to the capital, and on the same day, back in the capital the national bar association declared a one-month lawyers’ strike in solidarity.Internal pressure from journalists has shown signs of changing state media. Pro-government outlets had thus far played down the protests to the point of ignoring them, but the state broadcaster, RTS, showed live pictures of the crowds engulfing Novi Sad, to the anger of the SNS, which denounced the coverage as “scandalous”.Vučić has continued to hint, without evidence, that obscure outside forces are orchestrating the protests. “We don’t need governments imposed from the outside … without elections and without the will of the people,” he said on Instagram.At the same time the government has been back-pedalling ever faster. More than a dozen people were charged in relation to the Novi Sad disaster, including the former transport minister Goran Vesić. Vesić resigned, and then last Tuesday so didthe prime minister, Miloš Vučević.Like the government’s earlier threats, the concessions have only served to embolden the protests and boost popular support for the students.“This generation has proved we’re not as passive as we were brought up to be,” Ðurović said. “We were brought up not to participate in politics. We were taught we cannot change anything. Now we’ve proved that change is possible.”There is widespread agreement in all walks of life in Serbia that there has been a profound change in society over the past few months, but there is no clarity on what will happen next. The students have a set of principles and demands but freely admit there is no blueprint.“We just really want to have a lawful country to live in, and a peaceful society,” said Anja Stanisavljević, a student from the Novi Sad philosophy faculty. “I don’t think we have a full-on plan, but I don’t think we are going to stop until we get the change that we want.”What does the resignation of its populist prime minister mean for Serbia?Read moreVučić still has his hands determinedly on the levers of power, however. The economy is one of the fastest-growing inEuropeand he is not under any particular pressure from abroad, especially from western capitals. While his rhetoric tends towards the populist and anti-western, his actions increasingly lean the other way.View image in fullscreenA scarlet palm print has become the emblem of the protests, depicting the bloody hands of those in power.Photograph: Đorđe Kojadinović/ReutersSerbia has exported $800m in ammunition to western buyers, which has found its way to Ukraine. In August, the government bought French Rafale warplanes to replace the country’s Soviet-era MiGs. The EU has been largely silent since the start of the protests. Joe Biden’s ambassador to Serbia, Chris Hill, was often a cheerleader for Vučić, and the Serbian leader has put a deposit down on the new administration’s favour by granting permission to Donald Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, to build a Trump hotel in central Belgrade.“There are limits to how the street protests can be articulated in a way to lead to some kind of a transition,” said Ivanka Popović, a university lecturer and leading member of the pro-democracy group ProGlas. “I think the students have not yet decided how to move forward, which means everything is sort of on hold, and I think Mr Vučić is taking advantage of this. He’s a very experienced, skilled politician.”Vučić has said he intended to assemble a government of experts, though his probable appointees are unlikely to quell the protests. He could also call snap elections, giving the opposition a quandary over whether to take part.View image in fullscreenAleksandar Vučić has so far been wrongfooted by the protests, but may take advantage of students’ indecision, some say.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesMiša “Ronin” Bačulov, a well-known martial arts champion and motivational speaker, who has become a city councillor in Novi Sad and a prominent ally of the students, says elections would be meaningless unless preceded by a truly representative provisional government to create an even playing field in the skewed state-run media and electoral system.“Now it’s like getting into a rigged match. We at least want to have a fair chance,” Bačulov said, admitting there could be no guarantee that the protests had made such fundamental changes an inevitabilty.“It’s like we’re leading by 20 points, and it’s the last round,” he said. “But in a real fight, you can’t be sure until the last second that you’re going to win.”Explore more on these topicsSerbiaProtestActivismEuropefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Karla Sofía Gascón, best actress for Emilia PérezThe star of trans gangster musical Emilia Pérez had alreadycollected some griefover the film’s portrayal of Mexico, where it was set but not shot, and whether or not it was a step forward for trans representation. Writer-director Jacques Audiard apologised and the controversy didn’t seem to massively hurt the film’s Oscar chances, as itled the 2025 field with 13 nominationsincluding best actress for Gascón. However, a few days later, a journalist inspected Gascón’s social media feed andfound a string of inflammatory posts, including one that described Islam as “a hotbed for infection for humanity that urgently need[s] to be cured”. Gascón has since been on a contrition tour, includinga tearful, hour-long interview with CNNin which she declared: “My most sincere apologies to all the people who may have felt offended by the ways I express myself in my past, in my present and in my future”, but it looks like there’s no way back.2.Andrea Riseborough, best actress for To LeslieView image in fullscreenAndrea Riseborough at the 95th Academy Awards.Photograph: David Fisher/Rex/ShutterstockIn the 2023 Oscar race,Riseboroughbenefited from campaign regulations that allowed screenings to be hosted by A-list names, and thereby attracting more voter and media attention than it might otherwise. Riseborough’s turn in a film that would otherwise likely have gone by unnoticedwas pumped by the likes of Gwyneth Paltrow, Kate Winslet and Amy Adams, with Cate Blanchett namechecking it in an acceptance speech of her own. It worked at first; Riseborough got a best actress nomination, up against Blanchett, Michelle Williams and eventual winner Michelle Yeoh. But almostimmediately a huge row erupted, after campaigners accused the Oscars of racism as Riseborough’s inclusion was seemingly at the expense of Viola Davis for The Woman King and Danielle Deadwyler for Till. Such was the fury it was clear Riseborough had no chance of winning.3. Green Book, best pictureHaving come quickly out of the traps with the top prize at the Toronto film festival (practically a guarantee of an Oscar nomination), the putatively heartwarming race-reconciliation drama about a white driver and a black pianist in the 60s deep south, started to getbogged down in a series of controversiesas the 2019 awards race heated up. The film’s director Peter Farrelly apologised after newspaper articles from the 90s suggested he was an enthusiastic unasked-revealer of his genitals, co-writer Nick Vallelonga (son of the film’s lead character) turned out to have endorsed a false Donald Trump accusation about New Jersey Muslims cheering on 9/11 and the impeccably liberal lead actorViggo Mortensenunwisely used the N-word at a screening of the film. Most damaging, perhaps, was the emergence of a reported quote from actorMahershala Aliapologising for his role, saying: “I did the best I could with the material.” Green Book’s momentum carried it through though, winning three Oscars – best picture, best original screenplay for Vallelonga and best supporting actor for Ali – but it’s safe to say time has not been kind to the film.4. Zero Dark Thirty, best pictureView image in fullscreenKathryn Bigelow, left, with Zero Dark Thirty star Jessica Chastain.Photograph: Michael Buckner/Getty ImagesHer previous film The Hurt Locker having won best picture, directorKathryn Bigelowwas expected to steer this potentially crowdpleasing film about the hunt for Osama bin Laden to Oscar glory in 2013. In the event, it became a political football, attracting brickbats across the spectrum for itsperceived endorsement of torture, allegations it was beingused to support President Obama’s re-electionand claims ofoverly close cooperation with the CIA. Relatives of 9/11 victims also complained that recordings of voicemails were used without permission. The row intensified in January 2013 and without doubt dented the film’s prospects: Bigelow didn’t make it on to the nomination sheet for best director, and the film carried off only one of its five nominations – for best sound editing.5. Martin Scorsese, best director forGangs of New YorkIn 2003, Harvey Weinstein was arguably at the height of his baleful abilities as an industry mover and shaker with legendary powers of campaigning. (His company Miramax had already won Oscars for films as varied as Cinema Paradiso, Pulp Fiction and Shakespeare in Love.) Having taken onScorsese’s long-gestating period gangster epic, which starred Daniel Day-Lewis and Leonardo DiCaprio, Weinstein saw a golden opportunity to nab a statuette for Scorsese, who at that point had never won the best director Oscar. Miramax arranged for Robert Wise, the universally respected director of The Sound of Music,to publish a fulsomely supportive article in the Los Angeles Times, following it up with newspaper ads saying: “Two Time Academy Award Winner Robert Wise Declares Scorsese Deserves the Oscar for Gangs of New York.” Since it is against Academy rules for voters to announce who they are voting for, the move attracted immediate disapproval – and even more so when it turned out the article had been written by a campaign consultant working for Miramax. An innocent victim of the shenanigans, Scorsese once again fell at the final hurdle, but presumably Weinstein wasn’t that upset; Chicago, Miramax’s other big film in the race, won six Oscars, including best picture.6. Chill Wills, best supporting actor for The AlamoView image in fullscreenJohn Wayne talks to Chill Wills, right, on the set of The Alamo in 1960.Photograph: Everett Collection/Rex FeaturesIn 1960, John Wayne made his first official foray behind the camera, to tell the story of the celebrated 1836 standoff between Texas rebels and the Mexican army. Wayne put a lot of his own money into it and enthusiastically campaigned for the Oscars, for which it was duly nominated for seven, up against the likes of The Apartment and Elmer Gantry. However, its chances were largely scuppered by an advert on behalf of “Chill” Wills, the voice of Francis the Talking Mule, who was up for best supporting actor. The ad read: “We of the Alamo cast are praying harder – than the real Texans prayed for their lives in the Alamo – for Chill Wills to win the Oscar.” Oscar voters didn’t take kindly to the idea that Alamo fighters were being enlisted in Wills’s efforts, and Wayne took his own advert out, calling it “untrue and reprehensible”. In the event, at the 1961 ceremony Wills lost to Peter Ustinov, The Alamo lost toThe Apartment, and it all got blamed on Wills’s agent “Bow-Wow” Wojciechowicz.Explore more on these topicsOscarsAwards and prizesMarketing & PRFilm industryEmilia PérezGreen BookZero Dark ThirtyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

That’s publicly-owned-channel-still-expected-to-resist-rush-to-lowest-common-denominator TV-speak for what would elsewhere be known as “a new reality show”.Go Back to Where You Came From takes six “opinionated Brits” – “people with strong opinions about immigration” or “racists”, depending on whom you listen to out of the cacophony of criticism with which the announcement and broadcast of this programme has been greeted – and sends half of them to Syria and the rest to Somalia to experience what people there are fleeing from when they come to Britain, and the perilous journeys they undertake to get here. You can probably intuit that there is much to unpack and query.But first, let’s meet the contestants, which is what they are in all but name – competing, in effect, to undergo the most satisfying emotional and ideological overhaul by the end of the series.Dave is a chef, lives in Nottingham and suggests lining the coast with landmines to stop small boats crossing. “It’s like rats – leave food out, they’ll keep coming.” Jess, a sports coach from Wales and self-described “only gay in the village”, thinks “the people coming over here are rapists, paedophiles … I know my opinion is right and I know people will agree with me”. Nathan, a haulage contractor in Barnsley, reckons his children “will be going to work on a fucking camel” if the government doesn’t get a grip on immigration. Chloe, a Conservative pundit who has frequently appeared on GB News, knows that “my views are just common sense. In 10 years’ time, Britain’s going to be full of people wearing burqas. Islam will have taken over.”Mathilda, a humanitarian podcaster with experience of working in refugee camps abroad, thinks people have been manipulated by rightwing politicians and media and hopes to challenge Dave et al’s perceptions. Bushra, a Muslim woman and small-business owner from Surrey, thinks “a large portion of British people are as thick as shit. They are ignorant and … I am not the person you want to be having those ridiculous racist and Islamophobic conversations with.” Channel 4 is distancing itself from recent tweets by Bushra calling European Jews “lying scumbags” and asking: “Anyone else questioning everything you were told about Jewish history?” and other similar sentiments.Life is complicated, isn’t it? Can it be simplified and people educated by sending them toRaqqaandMogadishufor a few days then back to Britain via traditional migrant routes? Let’s see. While Nathan foghorns his way round a local marketplace, wondering why a small African nation devastated by decades of civil war and under constant threat from Al-Shabaab doesn’t have the wherewithal to keep things clean and tidy, we will discuss the two major questions that have arisen so far. One – is Channel 4 empowering racists by giving them a platform? Two, is watching six people playing at being refugees (they have 24-hour security and have not lived in bombed-out buildings under constant threat of attack by Islamic State sleeper cells or in a community stricken by war, poverty and famine) likely to bring enlightenment to them, and to viewers, that counteracts the distastefulness and hint of white-saviourism of it all?View image in fullscreenLearning curve? Dave, Chloe and Bushra in Raqqa, Syria.Photograph: MinnowMy own feeling, after watching the single episode available for review, is that allowing people to be honest about their opinions in public is a great deal better than pretending they don’t exist or requiring them to euphemise so ridiculously that they are effectively muted and thus enraged. Anyone who does not live with their head up their arse will have heard rat-type comments in ordinary life and it is stupid and cowardly not to engage with them publicly. There is no point continually preaching to the choir. If the series comprised six Mathildas, no Daves or Nathans would watch. This way, they might. If they do, they might see something that makes them think anew. If they remain unmoved (as Dave does not, by the way, though whether this lasts there is no way to tell) – well, no further harm, no further foul, I guess.I am less sure about whether a reality show is the best way to attempt any of this. The show depends on the kindness of suffering people to dispel the ignorance and encourage the emotional growth of a handful of westerners whose experiences may or may not have a wider impact. On the other hand, we do not live in a world where rigorous discussion of facts and figures with that same handful would ever occur or have any likely impact.Complicated indeed. I do long for the clarity of Chloe, who can look at children scavenging rubbish in Raqqa and suggest they are getting “an entrepreneurial kick out of it”. That must be nice.Go Back to Where You Came From is on Channel 4 now.Explore more on these topicsTelevision & radioTV reviewTelevisionReality TVImmigration and asylumRacereviewsShareReuse this content"

Don’t mention anything much, come to think of it. Stick to generalised soundbites. Careless talk costs lives. Keir Starmer’s trip to Brussels to meet EU leaders was fraught with danger. Don’t say anything too complimentary about the EU as all the Brexiters will go mad and shout “betrayal”. Don’t sound too hostile about the EU as remainers will also be up in arms. Try to find the tricky balance of somewhere in between. A politeness that lands the right side of indifference.Then there’s the US to worry about. How to cope with the orange manchild. Too much independence of thought and you might feel the full weight of trade tariffs. Time to bury your self-worth and go into full-fawning mode. Few people had ever come unstuck by tellingDonald Trumphe was an undiscovered genius. No one said that being prime minister was going to be easy. Or dignified.It was a tough act to pull off, but Starmer just about managed it in a very brisk press conference with the Nato secretary general,Mark Rutte, on Monday afternoon. Just the barest minimum. Opening statements that were so dull they died on the lips – precious little sign of Starmer’s delivery being improved by a voice coach here – and then three questions from the broadcasters. Then out of there.Rutte got things under way. Nato was amazing. The UK was amazing. The west had never been more united. That’s not quite how the rest of the world might see it with the US imposing tariffs on Canada – the ones on Mexicohave been deferred for a month– and Trump talking about making Greenland another US state. But hey. If the Nato secretary general says he’s relaxed about all this, then who are we to argue. Situation Normal All Fucked Up.Next up was Starmer. He too was thrilled about theNatoproject. It was good to be in Brussels. Though not too good. No one should think the UK might be about to enter negotiations to rejoin the EU. We just wanted the best proper relations while taking advantage of all the Brexit benefits. There was a 10-second pause while he tried to remember what they were. No. Me neither.Moving on. Britain was standing up to Russia. Nato was standing up to Russia. We were all behind Ukraine. President Trump had rattled Putin. A quick bit of fanboying the president never did any harm. We were spending 2.3% of GDP on defence. Tank production had reached a record high. Or something.Mysteriously, the three broadcasters had little interest in what Rutte and Starmer had just said. They wanted to talk about The Donald. Was he bad news forEuropeand international trade, asked Sky’s Beth Rigby.“There are always issues between allies,” said Rutte. The current difficulties were much ado about nothing. Trade war? What trade war? He was sure Trump would see sense aboutimposing tariffs on the EU. Mmm. This showed a touching faith in the president’s proximity to rational thought.Starmer wasted no time in praising The Donald. There was nothing remotely weird about a president who was so obviously an unreconstructed narcissist. If only more leaders were that shade of orange. The world would be a far safer place. Trump had been right to think about tariffs because so many people now took free trade for granted. Only someone as brilliant as Trump could possibly have reintroduced them.And he was delighted to report that though the Office for National Statistics (ONS) had said the UK had a trade surplus with the US, he was more than happy to accept the American figures that showed it was the US in surplus. So tariffs were strictly an EU problem. Far be it from him to interfere in a dispute with two such dear friends. But just to wipe the slate clean, he was now going to sack everyone at the ONS for even suggesting the UK was in surplus. There. Was that brown-nosing enough? I rather think it was.The second question came from the BBC. Could we return to reality? A trade war was not normal. Neither was the USthreatening to annex Greenland. This wasn’t how politics worked. Once again Rutte went out of his way to point out that Trump was the only sane one in the room. It was the rest of the world that was out of whack. Above all, he was enormously grateful for alerting the west to the geo-strategic nature of Greenland.Before The Donald’s intervention, he had never really given Greenland another thought. It was just an empty white space on the map. And all Mercator projections showed Greenland to be thousands of miles away from Russia. But now he had had time to look at a globe, he had come to appreciate just how important the country was.And guess what? Under all that snow and ice, Trump had discovered loads of rare minerals. So could we all have three cheers for the president. If I was a Greenlander, that little exchange wouldn’t have been entirely reassuring.Yes, said Starmer. Hooray for this Brilliant Orangeness. He just wanted to remind everyone that Trump had said he might not impose tariffs on the UK. So that was tremendously good news. There again he had also said “the UK was well out of line” – but maybe that was a joke. Or maybe he wasn’t entirely clear of the difference between the UK and the EU. But never mind. He was just Little Keir. And Little Keir wanted to get on with everyone. He loved the EU and the US. Couldn’t we all just be friends?Before Rutte and Starmer could declare their undying faith in the Supreme Intellect again, a Nato official intervened to declare that the press conference was done and dusted in under 15 minutes. Mark and Keir needed no second invitation. Anything to get away from their cloying bath of enforced sycophancy. Let’s hope they had a couple’s therapy session straight afterwards to cleanse themselves of the shame.On the way out, a Sun journalist shouted out a question. Had Starmer broken lockdown rules by employing a voice coach. Er … no he hadn’t. The rules on key workers were surprisingly loose in Westminster. Even I was a key worker. The bar doesn’t get much lower than that. Still, nice of the Tories to keep reminding us that it was them that consistently broke the lockdown rules.Explore more on these topicsKeir StarmerThe politics sketchMark RutteNatoDonald TrumpEuropean UnionEuropeForeign policycommentShareReuse this content"

Everything is gentleMon 3 Feb 2025 09.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 3 Feb 2025 16.08 ESTShareAmanatee looks like every animal I have ever tried to make with play-dough: roll a big piece into a sausage, flatten a bit on either side with your forefingers and a bit at the end with your thumb. Hey presto. A manatee also happens to be the grey of all play-dough colours mixed together.Imagine eating lettuce underwater: the crunch, the squelch. Reading about manatees, I finally give in and look up what the word “prehensile” actually means, as in a giraffe’s prehensile tongue, a monkey’s prehensile tail, a manatee’s prehensile lips. What could these things have in common, you wonder, for 25 years. Then it is time to find out.It means they can hold, manipulate or grasp things.My prehensile mind struggles to fold itself around the shape of a manatee: I have only ever seen them in videos, where they seem to be forever filmed in pieces, revealing themselves frame by frame this way, squashing their noses against glass that way. Andeating lettuce, forever eating lettuce.Manatee squashing its nose against glass.Their skin seems to scar like play-dough too: propeller cuts that look like indentations made by giant fingernails.Manatees don’t have incisors or canines, only “cheek teeth”. No hair, only whiskers. Algae growing on their backs. Everything is gentle. They can’t turn their heads sideways: they have too few vertebrae. Everything moves as one.In A Father’s Work is Never Done, a poem by Nathan Hoks, his father “devised this plan, we’ll stand on our heads and let the ocean wash over us. / The ocean will be a tub of mint tea. / The ocean will make the sound of a tuba and be filled with manatees”. Herman Melville, in Moby-Dick, describes so-called “pig-fish” as “a noisy, contemptible set, mostly lurking in the mouths of rivers, and feeding on wet hay”.A hadada: nothing can quite capture the sound of these birds, because it’s mainly just rude noise | Helen SullivanRead moreWhat do they sound like? Tubas? No, theysqueak and squeal. It makes no sense, and maybe that is part of the peace they seem to offer. Everything is a mess but manatees are a simple, if weird, shape. They seem to occur in videos surrounded by only two other things: green things that they eat and slightly cloudy blue water. Sometimes sunlight dapples on their backs.In A Marriage Poem by Ellen Bryant Voigt, “She wants something crisp and permanent, / like coral – a crown, a trellis, / an iron shawl across the bed”. But their marriage is at the age where she and her husband are caught between caring for their ageing parents and their children. They are more like manatees:Dearest, the beast of Loch Ness, that shy,broad-backed, two-headed creature,may be a pair of whales or manatee,male and female,driven from their deep mud nest,who cling to each other,circling the surface of the lake.Don’t try to find out whether manatees actually make mud nests. The Google results are for manatees who died in Mud River, Hernando County, Florida; and for wasps, who do make their nests with mud. The wasps really mess with the benevolence, the serenity, of thinking about nothing but a 500kg animal moving slowly through cloudy water and something green to eat.

On a cloudy day it’s a muted grey, but when the sun shines it transforms into a honey colour – like the stone on Bath’s Georgian houses. I like the geometric lines, the texture of the concrete, the layered walkways and the front, which could be the bow of a ship.My dad was an architect and I grew up in a modernist home he designed, which helped me appreciate postwar architecture. But it was the demolition of Birmingham Central Library [in 2016] that made me realise brutalist buildings were in danger. So I set about photographing as many as possible. Many people capture brutalism in austere black and white, but I photograph when the sun is shining and the sky is blue – to reflect the optimistic times many of these buildings were built in, when society was more equal.Most brutalist buildings were built for the public good – libraries, theatres, churches, schools, social housing – compared to the privately funded buildings of today, where it’s about profit, and access to the public is limited.Andrew Eberlin, Bradford-on-AvonKing Street West car park, Manchester – ‘There’s playfulness in the angular skybridge’View image in fullscreenBeauty and honesty … the concrete forms of King Street West car park.Photograph: Amanda Gardner/Guardian CommunityView image in fullscreenAmanda Gardner.Photograph: Amanda Gardner/Guardian CommunityI must have walked past the car park on King Street West 100 times. I’m sure I thought to myself, what an eyesore, and wished the council would smite it down and build something pretty to brighten my commute.But then my friend, a local historian, prompted me to appreciate its brutalist history and beauty. There’s something very honest about the design, built for purpose yet naturally drawing the eye – with hypnotising geometry.It was designed to be painfully practical, and yet there’s playfulness in the angular skybridge, which creates a mesmerising mathematical pattern. It almost feels like a grounded spaceship from another planet.Amanda Gardner, 34, ManchesterBrooke House, Basildon – ‘It seems to just float’View image in fullscreenStanding tall … Brooke House in Basildon.Photograph: Peter Manning/Guardian CommunityA favourite of mine is Brooke House, Basildon.

My heart just melted away in the summer sun. It was the way La Tulipe proudly and unapologetically embraced both its hard and its soft and pastel sides, playfully defying the macho vibes often associated with brutalism. For me, the core message of La Tulipe is that you have more fun when you dance away from the norm.Karin Bürki, ZurichHotel Uzbekistan, Tashkent – ‘It would be tragedy for these visionary works to become footnotes to history’View image in fullscreenUnornamented simplicity … Hotel Uzbekistan, Tashkent.Photograph: Alex Shutak/Guardian CommunityView image in fullscreenAlex Shutak.Photograph: Alex Shutak/Guardian CommunityWhen I was travelling for a year across Asia, brutalism always grabbed my attention. Its beauty for me lies in how its power, weight and unornamented simplicity call attention to the creative use of shape.Hotel Uzbekistan in Tashkent was a favourite. Its huge facade repeats a simple pattern, which has a strange optical effect.Young people should embrace brutalism. It’s part of our heritage, just like the older buildings that get much more love. It would be a tragedy for these works by visionary architects to become footnotes in history.Alex Shutak, 24, Fleet,HampshirePreston bus station – ‘I was overjoyed when it got listed status’View image in fullscreenA sense of possibility in the air … Preston bus station.Photograph: Paul Melling/AlamyView image in fullscreenJanet Raven Taylor.Photograph: Janet Raven Taylor/Guardian CommunityEvery Saturday in the 1980s, I’d catch the bus into Preston from the village of Bamber Bridge to meet friends, and our meeting point was always the bus station. I have such fond memories of that place. I was struck by the beauty of its design – the sweeping, curved lines of its exterior always fascinated me.There was a thrill in the bustling comings and goings of buses, the hum of conversations echoing off the hard, bold concrete surfaces, and the sense of possibility that hung in the air – the station and sprawling layout offering endless opportunities to chat, laugh, and make plans with my friends. It was more than just a transit hub; it was a social nucleus, a place where every meeting felt like the start of something exciting and unforgettable. I was overjoyed when it got listed status.Janet Raven Taylor, 58, PembrokeshireSídliště Ďáblice, Prague – ‘One of my favourite things is sitting by the pond’View image in fullscreenCoexisting with the surroundings … Sídliště Ďáblice housing estate.Photograph: Tom Hodgetts/Guardian CommunitySídliště Ďáblice is a large housing estate in Prague, which very few people visit without a reason. Two years ago, I started working in this part of Prague. Its sheer size instantly impressed me.Each block has its own unique decor in the entrance, easily visible through the doors and windows. The colours of the blocks complement the lush, thick trees which create a calm atmosphere throughout the whole estate.On sunny days, one of my favourite things is sitting by the pond; children are usually feeding the ducks or flying past on scooters. The concrete buildings coexist with the natural surroundings so well. To me, that’s brutalism at its best – functional and pleasant to look at. I understand why people seem happy here.Tom Hodgetts, 31, PragueThe University of Strathclyde’s School of Architecture building – ‘We grew to appreciate the austere and frugal honesty’View image in fullscreenStructural daring … the University of Strathclyde’s School of Architecture.Photograph: David Hasson/Guardian CommunityView image in fullscreenDavid Hasson.Photograph: David Hasson/Guardian CommunityI studied, and later taught, at theArchitectureBuilding at the University of Strathclyde, Glasgow. Both experiences were enriched by the robust generosity of the spaces, the light, the delightful purpose-built furniture. As students, we grew to appreciate the austere and frugal honesty of the use of materials, coupled with its structural daring. The university wanted to demolish it, but many of us who had personal connections, and others, rallied to its defence – and it is now Category B listed.The best brutalist buildings are among the most imaginative and finely crafted buildings of any period. We always detest the recent past. So much Victorian architecture was obliterated by that shortsighted, lazy attitude. Let’s not do it again. Much has already been lost, but it’s not too late.David Hasson, senior lecturer, University of Central LancashireUnité d’Habitation, Berlin – ‘It’s the perfect place to live!’View image in fullscreenThe best views in Berlin … ‘Corbusierhaus’.Photograph: Natalia Svedlund/Guardian CommunityView image in fullscreenNatalia Svedlund.Photograph: Natalia Svedlund/Guardian Community“Corbusierhaus”, as Germans call it, is a Unité d’Habitation building by Le Corbusier. It’s the perfect place to live! It’s near lakes and forests as well as the Olympic stadium and an open-air concert venue, and is 20 minutes from the centre by metro. We have the best views: east is the Berlin skyline, south is Grunewald forest, west has beautiful sunsets.Natalia Svedlund, 45, BerlinThe Barbican, London – ‘There was something unreal about it’When I was in my second year of university, I was quite unwell with my mental health, and was back at home for summer with my parents. The videogame Dear Esther is one of my favourites, and the Barbican was doing aplaythroughwith a live orchestra.

It was a sunny day, and there was something unreal about it. We had dinner and then walked through the centre at night, before ending up in the little studio for a performance. The music was very ethereal, with a strong lament-type style, and it fit the Barbican perfectly.I still try to visit the Barbican whenever I’m in London. It’s got an amazing, hard-edged brutalism, but for me it’s the softer features that make it stand out – the moulded curved concrete walkways, the stippled pillars and the pond at its centre.Calum, 29, CanterburyExplore more on these topicsArchitectureModernismThe BrutalistNational TheatreBarbicanShareReuse this content"

Has it made them rethink their own love lives?Mon 3 Feb 2025 11.07 ESTLast modified on Mon 3 Feb 2025 11.34 ESTShareBefore Nicola Walker andStephen Manganappeared on The One Show last year to promote the Christmas special of their BBC divorce drama The Split, they were warned not to go into too much detail about their next project: Mike Bartlett’s three-hander Unicorn, in which they play Polly and Nick, a married couple who bring a younger woman called Kate into their relationship.Walker, joined by her co-stars in an empty London theatre bar, sets the scene: “We were told: ‘This is a tea-time show, so don’t say anything about the, um, sexual nature of the play.’” The three actors are seated today in a row behind a table, rather as if they are interviewing me for a job. Sandwiched between Walker and Mangan, suitably enough, is Erin Doherty, who starred as Princess Anne in The Crown and will complete the on-stage throuple.The thing about Polly and Nick, and it’s a crucial element, is that they are still deeply in love after all these yearsWalker looked unimpressed when The One Show’s hosts referred to Unicorn as “racy”. What would be a better description? “Provocative,” says Mangan. “Or explicit.” Preciselyhowexplicit remains to be seen. The sex inCock, Bartlett’s 2009 playabout a different kind of love triangle, was expressed verbally rather than physically, whereas one stage direction in Unicorn reads: “They have sex.” Is it a coincidence that this occurs on page 69 of the script? “I didn’t notice that!” shrieks Doherty. Mangan raises an eyebrow. “You’ve unlocked something there,” he says.Theatre audiences may be reassured, initially, to see Mangan and Walker happily married in the play, after all the turmoil they’ve gone through together on TV. “No one should expectThe Spliton stage,” Mangan says. “But the fact that Nicola and I are so comfortable together has been helpful. When you’re acting with someone new, it can often be like: ‘Meet Sue. You two have been married for 25 years. And –action!’”View image in fullscreen‘Well, I did cheat on you’…Mangan and Walker in The Split.Photograph: Daniel Scale /BBC/Sister PicturesIt suits the dynamic of Unicorn that Doherty, who is 32, should feel like an interloper joining this long-established fictional couple in their mid-50s. “I don’t have to imagine that situation,” she says. “Most of the time in rehearsals, it does feel – not in a horrible way – as if I’m watching something from the outside.” Walker adds: “Kate is waiting for Polly and Nick to make up their minds about what they want.”Doherty was familiar with her co-stars, having watching The Split long before she was cast in Unicorn, an admission that causes Walker to turn suddenly in her seat: “You watched The Split?” she asks. Doherty replies: “It’s not like I was going to talk to you about it! I don’t want to be that guy.” Walker shoots back: “Well, I toldyouI’d watched The Crown.”Both shows have huge fanbases, although Doherty tends not to get bothered much in public, perhaps because she looks and sounds nothing like she did while portraying Princess Anne. “And maybe,” suggests Walker, “you’re not so approachable if you’re playing a royal.” Mangan, however, has found himself upbraided by fans of The Split. “I get told off a lot for cheating onNicola Walker,” he says. “Well, I did cheat on you,” she reminds him. “That’s what I always tell them,” he replies.One difference with Polly and Nick – and it’s a crucial element in Unicorn – is that they are still deeply in love after all these years. For them, polyamory is not a sticking plaster but rather a pleasure-seeking mission, as well as an insurance policy against future stasis. The hazards of embarking on their sexual adventure with Kate are weighed up endlessly by the couple, but Unicorn is clear that there can be just as much danger in staying put, closing off options, risking stagnation. “The play isn’t saying that the way forward necessarily lies in three people,” Mangan explains. “But sometimes, if it’s therightthree people, it can work.”View image in fullscreen‘Not so approachable’…Doherty as Princess Anne in The Crown.Photograph: Des Willie/APPerhaps there will be a quantifiable Unicorn effect on the audience, with relationships branching out, or breaking up, after exposure to all the ideas in the play. “I’m curious about the reaction,” says Mangan. “It’s not the usual boy meets girl story.” He looks around the empty bar. “I expect this will be quite a lively place in the interval. People will have strong opinions about what they’ve seen.”Walker remembers that kind of atmosphere at the original London production of David Mamet’s male v female campus dramaOleannaat the Royal Court in 1993. “There was that charged feeling in the auditorium,” she marvels. “Couples disagreeing about what was going on. It would be interesting if Unicorn turned out to be provocative in that way.” Mangan adds: “I have no idea whether people are going to laugh, be appalled or be angry.” Walker offers another option: “Or be turned on.”She argues that the play’s message reaches far beyond the concept of polyamory: it’s about remaining open to new ideas, embracing change rather than clinging to the past. “Nick has this speech about how things can’t be different if you lose the capacity to imagine them differently,” she says. “I see the play as a love letter to the human imagination: you’ve got to be able to imagine another world first …”Mangan takes up the idea: “Then you might be able to achieve the impossible.” In Unicorn, that translates into not just sexual and emotional idealism but also the environmental sort. Surprisingly, perhaps, for so lively and funny a piece of writing, the prospect of global catastrophe will be strongly felt on stage – as it was in Bartlett’s 2010 playEarthquakes in London, which addressed the climate emergency in a narrative stretching from 1968 to 2525.But back to the domestic. What has Mangan done to keep things fresh in middle age? “What, inmymarriage?” he says, looking horrified. Then he ducks the question. “We’re lucky as actors because you start again every time you begin a new job. It’s like the first day of school when you walk into rehearsals: you’re back to that nervous, frightened feeling, wondering if you can do it. You’re always taking that exhilarating leap into the dark.”View image in fullscreen‘Massive idea-bombs’ … Mike Bartlett.Photograph: Marc BrennerSo he doesn’t need to seek adventure, like Polly and Nick do, because he finds it at work? “No, I just know it’s a luxury for your job to involve exploring relationships and risk-taking and how to not let yourself atrophy. Then you can go away privately and think about what you might do differently in your life.”His character proposes a “truth buffet” but it sounds as if the cast are pigging out on a whole banquet of Bartlett’s ideas. “There are days when we’ve spent hours picking away at one scene, bringing our own experiences to the conversation,” says Doherty, practically licking her lips. “That’s the nature of brilliant writing: it can be pulled apart and still maintain its genius and integrity. This play is indestructible! You could set it alight, rip it up. You can keep trying to find all the answers but, wonderfully, you’ll never get them because it’s never one thing. It keeps shifting.”Walker cites one of Polly’s misty-eyed speeches, in which she appears to be trundling complacently down memory lane before a hairpin bend brings us up sharp. From big-age-gap relationships in movies to the lot of the straight male in modern society, Bartlett’s speciality, says Walker, is “throwing these massive idea-bombs into the audience”.In 2022, Doherty starred in theNational Theatre’s rain-soaked production of Arthur Miller’s The Crucible, her performance “staunch and febrile” according to Variety magazine. Can she see Unicorn’s truth buffets and idea-bombs enduring in the way that Miller’s have? “Yeah! This play is gonna get done and done and done. People will bring so many different angles, ‘What if we do it this way, or flip it that way?’”Then she stops abruptly, palms flat on the table. “Genuinely, this thought just came into my mind,” she says, glancing at her co-stars. “Wouldn’t it be amazing to seeother peopledo it?”“Ooh,” Walker gasps. “I like that.”“I’d love to see three other actors do this play,” Doherty continues.A pause.“I mean – not, like,thisweek,” says Walker.“Or even this decade,” Mangan adds.“No,” Doherty reassures them. “But one day.”Unicorn is at the Garrick theatre, London, 4 February to 26 AprilExplore more on these topicsStageMike BartlettStephen ManganNicola WalkerinterviewsShareReuse this content"

St Gilbert’s, she later tells one of the group, is all about “team players, not troublemakers” – and she had decided who the troublemakers were from the start.Daniel Lawrence Taylor’s satirical teen comedy first aired early last year. It is set at an exclusive boarding school where the students in question have been enlisted to make over a reputation that is stale, male, pale and generally appalling. Rupert, Carol’s son no less, has been filmed pouring champagne over a homeless man (if this sounds outlandish, it is only slightly worse thanthe infamous caseof a Cambridge student who burned a £20 note in front of a man who was sleeping rough). Enter stage left: five new students, all young, gifted and black, who have been shipped in from the big smoke by their mentor, Gus (played by Taylor). He reminds them of their talents but warns them to keep their heads down. Of course, that is easier said than done: Leah (Jodie Campbell) is grossed out by the school’s colonial vibes, which she likens toGet Out, Jordan Peele’s 2017 horror comedy about race, and quickly makes an enemy of the then headmaster, while Femi (Aruna Jalloh) is led astray by the popular kids, whose hazing rituals blur the line between friendship and bullying. Meanwhile, Jaheim (Josh Tedeku) remains embroiled in problems at home on his London estate; Omar (Myles Kamwendo) is more interested in joining a secret society than studying; and class clown Toby (Sekou Diaby) is accused of dealing drugs. There are laughs, romance, sex, drama – and a strong possibility that the gang might not make it through their A-levels.In series two, that prospect is all but confirmed by Watlington-Geese, who has decided that the school’s coffers are so empty that the scholarship programme must be reduced from five students to three by the end of the year. Femi, in particular, is stressed: he knows his dad will book him on the first flight back to Nigeria if he puts a foot wrong, and a new drama teacher seems to have it in for him. Leah, meanwhile, wants to put up a fight against Carol. (“So you learned absolutely nothing from last year?” deadpans Jaheim).View image in fullscreenA perfect ally – until she isn’t … Devon’ye (Kendra Brown) in Boarders.Photograph: Jonathan Birch/BBC/Studio LambertSlap-bang into the middle of this precarious situation arrives a new black exchange student from the US, Devon’ye, played by Kendra Brown, who is a perfect ally for Leah – until she isn’t. Brown and Campbell do an excellent job as the frenemies with everything in common but alsonothingin common, and tensions begin to mount during a school sleepover at which they screen Steve McQueen’s 2014 film12 Years a Slavefor their fellow pupils. As before, the series is at pains to show that there are many different ways to be black, some of which – as Leah points out when Devon’ye breaks into laboured slam poetry – have the potential to be “super, super cringe”.The stakes are high for everyone – not least Omar, whose standing with the Raisinettes society is under threat unless he gets them some salacious gossip. Kamwendo plays this bag of nerves with love and care, especially in scenes with love interest Dilton (Dillon Mitra). In fact, the core five are ever more impressive this time around, from Diaby’s tight comedy chops, to Jalloh’s forays into Shakespeare (he has performed with the RSC), and Tedeku’s masterly ability to convey the feeling that Jaheim has the weight of the world on his teenage shoulders at all times.View image in fullscreenThe stakes are high for everyone … Omar (Myles Kamwendo), Jaheim (Josh Tedeku) and Toby (Sekou Diaby) in Boarders.Photograph: Jonathan Birch/BBC/Studio Lambert Media LtdIt’s not perfect. As with many school-set shows before it, Boarders juggles a surfeit of plots and characters. That means sometimes we just don’t get enough of intriguing new faces, and guest spots from Alan Cumming and Natalie Cassidy (best known as Sonia from EastEnders) are more like cameos. Similarly, Wunmi Mosaku – who has starred in series such as HBO’s Lovecraft Country – is criminally underused as Jaheim’s mum, Grace: although maybe that is to be expected given they are estranged. There should always be more screen time for Abby (Assa Kanouté) whose mean girl tendencies have slowly given way to a sense of mutual understanding with the scholarship kids – after all, she’s only at St Gilbert’s because her dad used to be the headteacher and her place is now at risk too. We could also do with more scenes where Leah, Jaheim, Omar, Femi and Toby join forces (when they do occur, these are some of the strongest in the series).Still, these are minor bugbears in a show brimming with warmth, wisdom and a sense of barely concealed anarchy that often recalls some of the finest British teen comedies, from The Inbetweeners to Skins. As Boarders proves, you can be a team player and a troublemaker all at the same time.Boarders aired on BBC Three and is on iPlayer.Explore more on these topicsTelevision & radioTV reviewTV comedyTelevisionSchoolsreviewsShareReuse this content"

I’m bad in a good movie’: Guy Pearce downplays his performances as Oscars loomStuart HeritageHe’s been nominated for an Academy Award for The Brutalist, but all Guy Pearce is concerned with is how bad he was in Memento … oh, and in NeighboursMon 3 Feb 2025 11.41 ESTLast modified on Mon 3 Feb 2025 13.38 ESTShareThe Oscars are just one month away and nobody knows anything for sure, apart from the fact that Kieran Culkin is definitely going to win the best supporting actor category. This is all but written in stone at this point. Culkin has won most of the otherawards, and he’s a hit on the internet, and so the Oscars themselves are merely a formality.Which is fine, except that four other people have been nominated forbest supporting actor, and they’re faced with spending the next few weeks grinding through a thankless promotional campaign that they know will be fruitless. How does one even begin to do that? In the case of Guy Pearce, who is nominated forThe Brutalist, you spend your time telling everyone how rubbish you are.Memento at 20: Christopher Nolan’s memory thriller is hard to forgetRead more“I watched Memento the other day and I’m still depressed,” Pearce toldthe Timesthis weekend. “I’m shit in that movie. I’d never thought that before, but I did this Q&A of Memento earlier this month and decided to actually watch the film again. But while it was playing, I realised I hate what I did … I watched Memento and realised I’m bad in a good movie. Fuck!” Pearce then went on to say: “If I reckon my performance in Neighbours is two out of ten, Memento is a five.”The topic came up because, since Memento was made, Christopher Nolan has made a point of casting and recasting the same actors again and again. Take his new movie based onThe Odyssey, for instance. So far the names attached include Anne Hathaway (previously in The Dark Knight Rises and Interstellar), Matt Damon (Interstellar and Oppenheimer), Robert Pattinson (Tenet), Elliott Page (Inception), Benny Safdie (Oppenheimer), Himesh Patel (Tenet) and Bill Irwin (Interstellar). They do not, however, include Guy Pearce. For that matter, his name hasn’t come up in any film Nolan has made since the year 2000.And this clearly stings, not least because the “I’m bad in Memento” line isn’t even Pearce’s first try at rationalising this abandonment. In December, he claimed that he hasn’t worked with Nolan again because of a spiteful studio suit. “There was an executive at Warner Bros who quite openly said to my agent, ‘I don’t get Guy Pearce. I’m never going to get Guy Pearce. I’m never going to employ Guy Pearce,’” he toldVanity Fair. “So, in a way, that’s good to know. I mean, fair enough: there are some actors I don’t get. But it meant I could never work with Chris.”The Brutalist trailer – videoReally, it’s unfair that Guy Pearce has to try to explain this at all. Even though it has become a topic of interest online, it isn’t as if he’s the only actor to have only starred in oneChristopher Nolanfilm. Harry Styles hasn’t appeared in a Christopher Nolan film since Dunkirk, for instance, and after Oppenheimer he hasn’t cast Robert Downey Jr in The Odyssey. And then there’s Insomnia to think about. Nolan has made 10 films since then. That’s 10 chances to rehire Al Pacino, arguably the greatest screen actor of our age, and he hasn’t done it a single time. So Guy Pearce might be a Nolan soloist, but so is Pacino. It isn’t exactly a bad group to be in.Besides, it’s worth pointing out thatGuy Pearceisn’t actually bad in Memento at all. That film is such a temporal headache that it needed Pearce’s performance, as groggy and vague as it was, to sell it. It has become trite to say that Nolan’s films are chilly and unemotional, and yet Pearce packed as much humanity into his role as he possibly could. It might have even been the thing that stopped Memento from becoming as impenetrable as Tenet.Plus, even though he isn’t actually going to win the award, Pearce is now an Oscar-nominated actor. Thanks to his work inThe Brutalist, his stock has never been higher. Indeed, he now operates at a level where Christopher Nolan might actually notice him again. Both Nolan and Pearce are artists with long futures ahead of them, so it makes sense that their paths will cross again. That is, unless Christopher Nolan starts hiring Kieran Culkin in his place.Explore more on these topicsFilmGuy PearceOscarsChristopher NolanThe BrutalistAwards and prizescommentShareReuse this content"

The global fightback must start nowGaby HinsliffBritain is less vulnerable to US tariffs than other nations, but shares a historic responsibility. A recession would  mean dark days for everyoneMon 3 Feb 2025 13.18 ESTLast modified on Mon 3 Feb 2025 17.57 ESTShareCan a country ever be too big to fail? Waiting forglobal stock marketsto open this morning felt grimly reminiscent of the beginnings of the sub-prime lending crash, the moment many finally understood the old cliche that when the US sneezes, everyone catches a cold. But when it threatens to hack its nose off with a chainsaw, before changing its mind at 10 minutes to midnight, then nobody knows where they stand.The world’s biggest economy is now experiencing what looks like its very own Liz Truss moment, only this time in a country powerful enough to take everyone else down with it. If the US really is prepared to keep playing this mad game of chicken – threatening ruinous tariffs against Mexico then postponing them, sowing fear and discord constantly among its allies – that risks creating the kind of all-American supernova that sucks everyone into a black hole.Canada, which a few weeks ago wassending firefightersto help battle the Los Angeles wildfires,was told it wouldn’t just be whacked with tariffs but would be punished to a point where it “ceases to existas a viable country” and submits to becomingthe 51st stateof its aggressive neighbour. “Much lower taxes, and far better military protection for the people of Canada – AND NO TARIFFS,” Trump declared on his Truth Social platform. Also, no sovereignty. Magnanimously, the president has said he wouldn’tactually invadeCanada –more reassurancethan Denmarkgot when it rejected demands to hand over Greenland –but merely use economic force to similar ends.The demeanour of both the outgoing prime ministerJustin Trudeauand the probably incoming rightwing populistPierre Poilievreas they vowed to fight back suggested they no longer consider that a joke. Trump’s decisionto pause the tariff threat to Canada, after a late night chat with Trudeau, may bring just temporary relief. Yet Britain’s reaction to this shabby treatment of a Commonwealth ally has beentumbleweedrolling down Downing Street, even as Ontario supermarketsswept American beerfrom their shelves and arguably the world’s politest nationbooed the US anthemat weekend ice hockey games.Could British reticence be related to the way the president waited for the morning Keir Starmer was due to meet all 27 EU leaders for the first time since Brexit to announce that the EU is definitely getting it in the neck, but maybe differences with Britain “can be worked out”? Like a mafioso offering protection, this probably isn’t a kindness. (Those differences historically involved British reluctance to eat chlorine-washed chicken or make the NHS pay higher market prices for US drugs.)But even if it is, the fact that the school bully has picked on someone else isn’t really the point. What do we imagine will happen to us if a “move fast and break everything” presidency tips our trading partners into recession? Or if Britain’s bond markets start following the US’s upwards, raising borrowing costs to the point where Rachel Reeves’s scope to avoid spending cuts disappears? Which of our enemies benefits from a weakened, undefended Europe? Like it or not, we’re all in this together now, trying to contain the threat from a superpower to whom the west has historically looked for protection, while struggling to believe that can really be happening. And all because Trump has developed a monstrously simplified theory of the world in which (for him) tariffs solve everything.Threatening to impose them is now the first lever he yanks when politically challenged – as he did successfully whenColombia initially declinedto accept planeloads of returned immigrants, and now again to force Mexico to put troops on the border – and if he ever really wants something from the UK that we decline to give, presumably we would fare no differently. But he also seems to consider tariffs a better (and easier, given they don’t need congressional approval) way of raising revenue than taxes. Slapping them on the US’s biggest trading partners for seemingly spurious reasons will raise billions, mostly from American consumers who have already suffered painful inflation but will now pay more both for imported goods and goods made at home using imported components. But those billions can then presumably be spent radically cutting taxes. It’s as if the president were trying to remake the world’s biggest economy overnight, rebalancing it away from taxing income or wealth to a form of tax on consumption favouring the wealthy, but in the process forcibly remaking everyone else’s economy too.In theory, the markets should already have priced in the risks of what the Wall Street Journal calls “the dumbest trade war in history”, given Trump advertised it so openly in advance. Earlyreactions on Monday– London’s FTSE 100 down 1.4% on opening, the Nikkei in Japan down 2.8%, and Wall Street’s indexes sliding as analysts at JP Morgan warned of a potentially “business unfriendly” stance – looks more slump than crash, with analysts assuming tariffs won’t last. But there is more turmoil to come.Over the weekend, Elon Musk’s team of mysterious hatchet men were busy identifying what he claims are$4bn-a-day savingsin government spending, allegedlylocking officials outof their own computer systems and riding roughshod over Congress’s right to determine how money is spent in the process. It is hard to imagine cuts that deep not playing havoc first with commercial government contracts – which may have further market consequences – but more pertinently with human lives.The US’s entire overseas aid programme was fed “into the woodchipper” first, Musk announced, casuallytorpedoing humanitarian programmesaround the globe – from famine relief in war zones to childhood vaccinations and attempts to prevent the next pandemic – and terminating a key western soft-power mechanism for competing with Russian and Chinese influence. The implications for some of the world’s most unstable countries are grim.Since nobody voted to Make America Poor Again, maybe ordinary Americans will soon tire of this. But Brexit showed that voters’ reaction to realising they’ve been had is often to double down, because it’s too painful to think they have brought this on themselves.So even if Britain is better placed than some to survive it, don’t doubt the gravity of the moment. Every British government this century has had an unwanted sisyphean task dumped upon it, from responding to 9/11 to the banking crash, Brexit to the pandemic. Now Starmer has his: to do together with allies whatever tiny things we can to prevent a rogue US triggering a global recession and ultimately perhaps even a slide to war. Those who argued for waiting to see whether Trump really meant it had a point. But we’ve seen enough to know these tactics are utterly destabilising. Now we must act as if we mean our response.Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

It’s a very different world for gen ZMon 3 Feb 2025 08.47 ESTLast modified on Mon 3 Feb 2025 11.43 ESTShareIt is 29 years since the book Bridget Jones’s Diary was published, but the column itself, which ran in the Independent (without a byline forHelen Fielding, although everyone knew it was her) and the Daily Telegraph, is 30 years old this year. That’s two years younger than our heroine when she first appears, a patchwork wreck of singleton-anxiety, professional disaster, chardonnay, Silk Cut and weighing scales. And maybe being old enough to remember with clarity anything from 30 years ago predisposes you to think of it affectionately. But, actually, no: some things were better for women, better for young people, better for everyone, in 1995. And some things were worse. To coincide with the fourth film, out on Valentine’s Day, here’s the audit.The startling thing about the comic creation was how completely she lacked any kind of self-discipline – always drinking more than she meant to, always weighing more than she intended, always determined not to smoke yet somehow also smoking. At the time, this had long been a staple for male self-fashioning: lad-mag culture was focused (ironically) on birds, but fuelled by benders. If you woke up somewhere and couldn’t remember how you got there, that was social nirvana, the ultimate night out. Ladette culture was in many ways built as a mirror to that, though a distorted one, in the sense that you had to be off your head but you couldn’t look sloppy or ill-kempt. You were meant to drink like Johnny Vegas but look like Kate Moss.Part of the comedy and originality of Bridget Jones was her honest break with that impossibilism. She was not carefree; she worried about everything, all the time. Although she played hard, she did not work hard. She spoke the language of female emancipation, but it wasn’t her mother tongue: she fretted constantly about men, in the romantic sense (why wouldn’t they call her?) and the cultural (what is a body image problem, if not the harsh criticism of the patriarchy, turned in on oneself?).View image in fullscreenPhoebe Waller-Bridge in Fleabag.Photograph: APIt wasn’t so much radical as refreshing, in the way truthfulness always is. But, looking back, Bridget Jones was an optimistic and almost comforting creation, in a way that subsequent, similar characters – Fleabag,Charli xcx’s Brat– were not. And that was economic: you were always pretty confident that Bridget was going to land on her feet, not just romantically, but also professionally. If she messed up at work, they’d either forgive her or someone would give her a new job. She could always make rent. This was slightly before the era of Cool Britannia and Things Can Only Get Better as the anthem of politics, but there was already that confidence that everything was going to be OK. (In hindsight, it was built on debt and end-of-history fantasies.)When I look at the clean living and self-care for which gen Z is known, and compare that with the hedonism and recklessness of Bridget, I can’t help but think it’s not that they are more risk averse; it’s just that the risks are greater. If they fall off the carousel, professionally, there’s a chance they might not get back on. Plus, even on the carousel, things are quite tough.Big knickers, bad decisions and old bats: Renée Zellweger on the return of Bridget JonesRead moreThe body image stuff, though, sheesh – Bridget Jones, in the column and the book, gave herself hell. This is yourwild and precious life, you want to yell at her, and you’re wasting it on the difference between 9 st 10 and 9 st 12. But when Renée Zellweger was cast to play her in the film (the first one was released in 2001), the commentariat uproar validated every moment of anxiety Bridget had ever had: the scrutiny of Zellweger’s body was remarkable. Could she ever be tubby enough to play not just Bridget Jones, but any British woman at all? What on earth would she have to eat, to embody this lovable doughball? Would she ever get her figure back? Was the price too high? On this, society has changed for the better. Few actors in 2025 would take this kind of public policing.Those aren’t reasonable trade-offs, are they? You can be whatever shape you like, but you also have to treat your body like a temple, and get used to being precarious. On balance – in shock news from a 51-year-old – 30 years ago, things were better.Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Now the region is thrust in the global spotlightMon 3 Feb 2025 11.21 ESTLast modified on Mon 3 Feb 2025 17.29 ESTShareThe enormous semi-enclosed bay, its waters flanked by the Florida and Yucatán peninsulas and partially blockaded by Cuba, has been called the Golfo de Méxicofor centuries, a name that first appeared on a world map in 1550. And for centuries the name bothered no one.Thomas Jefferson used the name without shame, even as he, Donald Trump-like, imagined dominating nearby nations. If the US could take Cuba, Jefferson wrote in 1823, it would control the “Gulf of Mexico and the countries and isthmus bordering on it”. Country music stars, no less than founding fathers, liked the romance of the place. Tracy Lawrencedreamsof a Gulf of Mexico filled with whiskey. Johnny Cash wanted todumphis blues down in the Gulf.But Trump says it’s time for a change, that the great bay should be called the Gulf of America. He signed anexecutive ordermaking it so, emphasizing the Gulf’s economic importance to the US. Trump’s right. If the intensive extraction of riches from a patch of nature bestows proprietary rights over that patch, then the Gulf belongs to the US. For more than a century, its industries have drilled, fracked and fished it to such an intense degree it’s a wonder there’s any oil, gas or seafood left to be had.Many who work and live in Louisiana and Texas have their own name for the place. They call it the industrial coast, a region where gas flare-offs burn 24/7, where fracking blowoutsblazeuntil the vapor runs out and where rusting pipes and tall stacks billowing black and brown smoke are organic to the landscape – present at the creation, not oftheworld but ofourworld today, dominated by petrochemical and petroleum companies.What is happening in Los Angeles is our future | Francine ProseRead moreMarine oil drilling in the Gulf started in 1938, atop a wooden platform resting on pine pilings driven down into 14 ft of water, about a mile off Creole, Louisiana. Now, with shallow oil fields nearly depleted, Shell, British Petroleum, Exxon and other companies go into ever deeper water, with ever longer drills, to dig wells into the ocean floor, forcing chemicals into ancient rock to frack for oil and gas. Every year, “ultra-deep” maritime sources of petroleum make up a larger percentage of US oil production.Off-shore oil drilling no longer relies on “platforms” fixed to the seabed. The industry instead builds enormous floating complexes, or hubs comprising drill ships, semi-submersible units tethered to the sea floor with ropes and chains and floating production and storage systems including tanker-like vessels. They look like floating factories, sporting killer names such as Mad Dog, Argos, Thunder Horse and Atlantis. Shell’s Perdido hub bobs 200 miles south of Galveston, at outer edge of the US’ maritime jurisdiction, running 22 wells connected by 27 miles of pipes that can handle 100,000 barrels of oil a day. The investment in this infrastructure is enormous, second only to the expected profits.The risks are equally enormous. The farther out, the deeper down, the harder it is to contain a spill or blowout. In 2004, Hurricane Ivan blew down a Taylor Energy platform, opening a crater spewing oil and gas. Just 11 miles off the coast of Louisiana, and only 475 ft above the seabed, Taylor found it impossible to contain the rupture, which to this day still spills crude oil and gas into the Gulf. The leak is expected to continue for at least a century more.BothMexicoand Cuba drill for oil offshore, and Mexico’s Bay of Campeche, in the south-western Gulf, is in bad shape. In 1979, an exploratory offshore rig exploded, resulting in a disastrous spill. To this day, oil slicks from that spill can be found in Mexico’s mangrove estuaries. Yet petroleum contamination in Mexico is limited by technological limitations. Pemex, Mexico’s nationalized oil company, doesn’t have the machinery to drill and frack as intensively and extensively as US companies do.Nor, as of now at least, does it have the desire. Mexico’s president, Claudia Sheinbaum, has criticized what she calls an “obsession” with deep-water drilling and has halted policies by past administrations to extend leases to foreign companies to operate far off shore.Trump, and other Republicans, ran on that obsession. “Drill, baby, drill”. Nearly all the US’s offshore oil drilling takes place in the Gulf, which yields more than 650m barrels of crude a year. Oil companies don’t want to expand to increase this output. To do so would drive downprices. Rather, they want to expand to push back petroleum’s horizon, to make sure the sun doesn’t set on fossil fuel production. If the investment is made, if the infrastructure is built and highly capitalized hubs like BP’s Mad Dog are up and running, it will be hard, in the future, to give up burning fossil fuel, no matter how many solar panels China sells to third world countries.For decades oil companies in the Gulf built their rigs and ran their wells with little oceanographic oversight. The bulk of federal research dollars went to Woods Hole to study the Atlantic and Scripps to focus on the Pacific. That changed on 20 April 2010, when a mix of methane, drill-bit lubricant and water exploded, taking down British Petroleum’s Deepwater Horizon – a fifth-generation ultra-deepwater semi-submersible rig operating 50 miles off Louisiana and atop 5,000ft of water. The blast killed 10 workers and opened a hole in the sea floor that gushed oil for months, in what was the Gulf’s worst environmental disaster to date.The farther out, the deeper down, the harder it is to contain a spill or blowoutAs part of the settlement negotiated with the Obama administration, BP paid, in addition to fines and clean-up costs, half a billion dollars to set up a research fund to study the effect offshore drilling has on marine life.What researchers learned was disturbing. One decade-longstudy, headed by a University of South Florida marine biologist, Steven Murawski, found that a significant amount of oil had settled on the bed of the Gulf, a product not just of the Deepwater Horizon spill but of thousands of rusting rigs, leaking pipes and past spills. Storms and tides regularly agitate this film, “resuspending” oil in water columns, where it is sucked in by species that swim closer to the surface. Researchers sampled thousands of fish comprising nearly a 100 species, from deep-sea game to the catfish and flounder found in Louisiana’s brackish bayou. “We actually haven’t found one oil-free fish yet,” said Murawski in 2020.Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) are the most toxic elements of crude oil, and they were found in every fish Murawski’s researchers tested, with the fast-swimming yellowfin, or Ahi, tuna clocking extremely high levels. The Gulf of Mexico is among the nation’s most profitable fisheries, second in volume only to Alaska. It’s also among the most overfished. Sturgeon are threatened and the bluefin tuna population is “near collapse”. But there’s plenty of “oil-laden” yellowfin, which every day is shipped to the nation’s canneries and restaurants.Offshore oil and gas drilling creates what is called “produced water”, which comes up out of the well with oil and gas condensates, and then is discharged back into the sea. Produced water is pure poison, comprised of heavy metals and radioactive materials, including Radium 226, which has half-life of 1,600 years. For every barrel of oil extracted, about a barrel and a half worth of produced water is dumped back into the Gulf, a staggering volume of highly carcinogenic liquid.The poison comes from every direction, with more toxic waste released into the Gulf of Mexico than into any other comparable body of water. The Gulf of Mexico catches the outflow of the mighty Mississippi, which includes PCBs, dioxins, lead, mercury and phosphorus released by the refineries, factories and plantations that line the river. Louisiana’s coast is a filigree of coves, marshes and wetlands, many of which are highly polluted. A growinghypoxic dead zone– water with little or no oxygen where few living things can survive – exists off the coast of Louisiana. Now the size of New Jersey, the dead zone roughly doubles every year.And the water is getting hotter. The American Meteorological Society recently reported that over the last half-century, the Gulf’s water temperatures have been rising twice as fast as those of the Atlantic, damaging reefs, accelerating hypoxia, destroying phytoplankton, intensifying hurricanes and stressing marine life.Rice’s whales, a species unique to the Gulf, have fallen below 100 in number.Terrestrial life is under equal assault. The most vulnerable people live in Mississippi and Louisiana, the poorest and sickest states in the union. Cancer Alley – a chain of river parishes running about 90 miles along the Mississippi from the Gulf to Baton Rouge that is home to hundreds of oil refineries and petrochemical plants – posts the highest rate of cancer from industrial pollution in the US, seven times the national average. In Iberville parish last October, residents were told to shelter in place after an ExxonMobil pipeline carrying ethyleneexploded, which couldn’t be repaired until the gas in the pipeline had been burned off.Similar “shelter in place” warnings are regular occurrences in Cancer Alley, as industrial accidents occur frequently in plants that transform ethane, propane, butane, alumina and methane into industrial chemicals, pesticides and aluminum. Residents think the plants that make plastics are the most lethal. “We’re dying from inhaling the industries’ pollution,” Sharon Lavigne, a St James parish resident,toldHuman Rights Watch, “I feel like it’s a death sentence. Like we are getting cremated, but not getting burnt.”The industry ... cares less about new leases and fields than it does government support to move ahead with massive new petrochemical infrastructure projects, especially plastic factories ...Such cancerous “sacrifice zones” range along the Gulf coast, from Mississippi toTexas, their residents suffering from high rates of miscarriages, preterm births and defects, chronic rashes, persistent asthma and other illnesses, including now due to global warming,tropical diseases and parasitessuch dengue and equine encephalitis. The residents of Reserve, Louisiana, live in the shadow of Pontchartrain Works, the only factory in the country that makes synthetic rubber neoprene. They suffer “extremely improbable” high cancer rates. Poverty aggravates illnesses. About 10 million coastal residents live below the poverty line; one in 10 Black people in Louisiana and Mississippi live in conditions equal to or worse than those found in developing nations.If Trump achieves his broader, interlocking agenda, the Gulf’s miseries will multiply.The Department of Interior during Trump’s first term, from 2017 to 2021,openedsizable areas on land and sea for oil exploration and leases, including in the Gulf. The industry didn’t have time to take advantage of the generosity and stuck with safer and cheaper onshore plays in North Dakota and Texas’ Permian Basin. Trump is again pledging to do away with as many restrictions as he can on drilling and fracking.The industry, though, cares less about new leases and fields than it does government support to move ahead with massive new petrochemical infrastructure projects, especially plastic factories, in the cancer zones of Louisiana, Texas and Mississippi. Activists have been fighting plans by Formosa Plastics to build a 2,400 acre petrochemical complex, at a cost of nearly $10bn capitalized by Chase and Bank of America, in Cancer Alley’s St James Parish. Doubtful they’ll get a hearing in Trump’s Environmental Protection Agency, and the more judges Trump can appoint the more appeals they’ll lose.Over the last decade, more than 50 plastic plants have been built or expanded, many of them in the Louisiana and Texas Gulf coast where theyreceivelocal and state tax breaks equal to or more than the combined budgets of the state agencies in charge of monitoring them. ExxonMobil – which just openeda polypropylene plantin Cancer Alley – an enormous tangle of pipes, tubes, storage tanks and smoke stacks – told shareholders that it was hedging plastic against gasoline, that whatever profits the company loses to electric cars will be offset by the growing demand for plastic goods. There will always be, as the saying goes, “a great future in plastics”.Trump’s election has brought to power a generation of know-nothings – free-market, anti-DEI obsessed ideologues who are hostile to government-produced research and knowledge, be it the kind of ecological research conducted in the aftermath of the Deepwater Horizon blowout, the oversight of industrial production and expertise regarding specific animal species, including what might be causing their toxicity or endangerment. As per the recommendation of Project 2025, scientific and medical research should be left to universities or the private sector, and whole government agencies – such as the Department of the Interior’sBiological Resources Division, which does research on marine life in the Gulf, among other places – should be abolished. Trump’s freezing of money to study cancer and other diseases – which will potentially impact all citizens, but none more so than those who live in Cancer Alley – is part of this willful ignorance.Trump’s cadres don’t want to know anything about the linkages between petroleum, the environment, sickness, mortality, income and race. A Gulf researcher at a federal agency, who asked to remain anonymous, told me that her colleagues began removing, pre-emptively before Trump’s inauguration, language from their files that might rile future administrators. Anything related to the climate crisis, of course, but also, she said, any reports that used the concept “One Health” – a term adopted by federal scientists and doctors that means approaching a problem holistically by examining the “interconnection between people, animals, plants and their shared environment”. Seeing the big picture is now verboten.Ignorance is not just a Trump vice. Marine biologists who studied the Gulf on the BP half-billion-dollar fund complain that none of the oversight proposals based on their findings were adopted by the federal agencies, especially the recommendation that “produced water” discharged be routinely monitored. Every entity that flushes water into nature – your local garbage dump, for instance – is required to monitor the chemical composition of the discharge, with the findings published on the EPA website – except for oil and gas producers.Los Angeles is on fire and big oil are the arsonists | Tzeporah BermanRead moreIf there wasn’t much oversight of fracking and oil drilling, on land or sea, under the Obama and Biden administrations, there’ll soon be much less. All the many government agencies charged with mitigating the worst effects of oil, petrochemical and fishing industriesamong others – the EPA, the National Ocean and Atmospheric Administration, National Marine Fisheries Service, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, which overseas offshore leases for oil and gas – will be gutted, with what’s left staffed by loyalists. Trump says he wants to abolish or reduce the powers of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, as part of a general incapacitation of the federal government – a move that portends catastrophe, if, say, a category 5 hurricane, powered by the Gulf’s warming waters, were to hit Shell’s Perdido hub.No one, not Trump’s electoral base nor his oil industry backers, had been clamoring for the Gulf of Mexico to be rechristened the Gulf of America. But lo, Google just announced it will switch out Mexico for America on its maps.The attention to the dust-up, which naturally has drawn criticism from Mexico and Cuba, who share jurisdiction over the waters in question with the US, will be fleeting. The Gulf will return to the margins of national consciousness, until the next devastating storm or spill.BP’s half-billion-dollar fund to study oil’s effect on the ecosystem is tapped out. And, anyway, scholars in public universities – especially in red states like Florida, Mississippi, Louisiana, and Texas – will think twice about producing studies that cast Trump’s Gulf of America, and the fossil-fuel industry that poisons it, in an unflattering light.Greg Grandin is an American historian and author.

On a recent Wednesday afternoon, the car park was full and the cafe was bustling with people my parents’ age and older, chatting over milky coffees and slices of cake. The retired ladies who talk to me in the gym changing room love to come here for a jacket potato after their aquafit class.Yet, as I stepped through the automatic doors, the plants weren’t immediately visible. First, I had to pass a bright deli counter, an area filled with homeware and crockery, shelves of fragrant toiletries, and a section of children’s toys before anything remotely connected to gardening came into view. I waded through gloves, power tools, pesticides and outdoor furniture, and then, finally, I found the annual bedding plants and potted shrubs. Here, all was quiet. The gardening section was quite unlike the busy cafe; I was alone but for one member of staff.This isn’t the type of place I tend to go looking for plants. There’s something about the floral wellies and superfluous tatof your average garden centre that I find off-putting. Curious as to whether other gardening folk felt the same way, I asked my Instagram followers whether they sought out their plants in large garden centres like this one. Over 100 people responded, sharing a surprising depth and breadth of feeling about these places – from resolute disdain to sincere warmth and fondness.Getting an allotment totally changed my summer – and radically altered my relationship with food | Diyora ShadijanovaRead moreI related most to those who said the abundance of plastic and shelves full of chemicals had put them off garden centres. “I think they perpetuate all the ways the gardening industry is screwing up the environment,” one gardener named Emma told me. These gardeners – myself included – favoured smaller, family-run operations, specialist nurseries and plant fairs run by dedicated, experienced plantspeople who could offer advice and inspiration. A number of people told me they preferred to know how and where plants were grown before buying them; ideally, they bought plants propagated locally, without chemicals, certainly notusing peat, which releases substantial amounts of CO2when it’s extracted from the ground. Another gardener, Harry, told me that his nearby garden centre continued selling peat and the environmentally harmful herbicide glyphosate, which seemed “woefully behind the times”.Even so, most people described garden centres as joyful places where they like to spend time with their families, gather ideas for the gardens they hope to grow, have a good look at plants before investing in them and – yes – enjoy some coffee and cake. One respondent even described those in rural areas “as a core civic space”. Given all this, it might seem surprising that some garden centres are closing down. Both Dobbies and Homebase have announced the closure of a number of their sites in recent months.One of the reasons for this, proposed in arecent Daily Mail article, is that young people are to blame. It claimed gen Z are visiting garden centres for the cafes, candles and cuddly toys but are failing to drop enough cash to keep these businesses afloat. Yet look a little closer, and it becomes clear that young people areinterested in plants. According toone survey, 83% of 18 to 34-year-olds think gardening is “cool”. Given that most younger people are less likely toown a home(let alone a garden) of their own than previous generations, that’s a welcome surprise. And since gen Zs and millennials are far more concerned about theclimate crisisthan older generations, it follows that they would be looking for ways to garden that align with their values, mirroring the sector-wide trend towards nature-centred approaches to gardening.There are many prominent gardeners – including RHS Chelsea gold medal-winning garden designer,Tom Massey– who represent a broader shift away from gardening as a purely aesthetic practice, and instead create gardens that are nature-centric as well as beautiful (and delicious, if they grow edible plants as I do). Instead of obliterating insects with pesticides and uprooting so-called weeds, many of the gardeners I know and admire engage in gentle, considered cultivation, where tidiness is eschewed in favour of a nurtured wildness that is welcoming to wildlife. Ecological home growerPoppy Okotchaand edible gardenerHuw Richardsboth exemplify how younger gardeners are embracing a more holistic horticultural approach.I find that being more environmentally conscious in the way I garden compels me to interrogate the choices I make both for the green spaces I steward and in my life beyond. Learning the alchemy of propagation, creating new plants from cuttings, growing crop from seed or splitting a mature plant into multiple new ones to share for your fellow gardeners are remarkable experiences that have encouraged me to decouple my gardening practices from the consumerism of garden centres.Similarly, I’d urge new young gardeners to find ways to garden without emptying their bank accounts. Perhaps what makes gardening meaningful can’t simply be bought in a garden centre.Claire Ratinon is an organic food grower and writerExplore more on these topicsGardensOpinionOrganic gardeningPesticidesWildlifecommentShareReuse this content"

Imperialism? Alliances with billionaires? Those shocked at the president’s early moves have forgotten what came beforeMon 3 Feb 2025 01.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 3 Feb 2025 09.45 ESTShareThe dust briefly settled, only for it to be kicked up once again. Donald Trump’sflurry of executive orders– causing chaos on everything from foreign aid to world trade – is rapidly rocking and reshaping domestic and foreign policy. And the temptation is, yet again, to think of Donald Trump as an exogenous shock to US democracy. But look closer, and you will see not a rogue president taking a hammer to a hitherto stable political order, but a history of the erosion of norms that paved the way for him.Political norms are the scaffolding of democracy, enforced not by the law, but by a sort of social consensus. They are not codified, strict mechanisms for regulating political facts – such as the separation of powers – but the agreement that such things should be respected and observed. A clear case in point is the president’s ability to issue pardons. And Joe Biden’spardoning of his family memberswas as much an injury to norms asTrump’s pardoningof those convicted after 6 January.“We talk about America’s system of government,” New York Times columnist Ezra Kleinsaid after Trump’s inauguration, “as if it is a solid thing, bound by the constitution and institutions the way a belt cinches around the waist. But it’s really just a pile of norms in a trenchcoat. Knock the norms down and everything changes.” Trump’s very purpose is to knock them down, but in some ways, he is only accelerating a process that had already started.Take Trump’s order to construct amigrant detention centrein Guantánamo Bay – a space that has for years operated outside international law despite outcries and appeals for closure. Hundreds of prisoners were kept there under military law, often following rendition, disappearance andtorture at CIA black sites. Trump’s proposal to detain tens of thousands of migrants there is an outrageous move, but it is not an aberration. He is building, literally, on what came before him.In Trump’s fantasy politics, he can accomplish anything – but reality will prevail | Andy BeckettRead more“Like many of Trump’s authoritarian attacks on human rights, this one has shameful precedents in US history,” Vince Warren, executive director of the Center for Constitutional Rights,told CNN. “Long before the second Bush administration used the facility to hold and abuse nearly 800 Muslim men and boys as part of its ‘war on terror’, the first Bush administration held Haitian refugees there to try to deny them their rights under international law.” The prison, in fact, currently houses detained migrants in a facility called theMigrant Operations Center. Last year, the Biden administrationawarded a private contractorover $160m (£130m) to run the facility.Another of Trump’s directives also builds on precedent. One of his executive orders pledges todeport studentsand others without US citizenship who participate in pro-Palestine protests. But their actions were already condemned and over-policed way before Trump was re-elected. Don’t forget that the Democratsblocked requestsfor a Palestinian speaker at their convention, and across the country “liberal” academic institutions expelled students for protesting,withheld their degrees, andcalled in armed policeto dismantle their sit-ins.The same goes for Trump’s withdrawal from international organisations such as the World Health Organization and hisimperial adventurismwhen it comes to foreign policy. The US has a long record, under much more gentlemanly presidents, of breaking international law,insulting international institutions and embarking on unilateral campaigns licensed by its superpower status. Over two decades ago, Congresspassed a lawauthorising “all means necessary and appropriate” to “free US or allied personnel detained by or on behalf of the International Criminal Court”. It was dubbed the Hague Invasion Act.The “war on terror” was itself one long, disastrous, norm-busting campaign. A week before the US and its allies invaded Iraq, the United Nations secretary general warned them that military action would be a violation of the UN charter.Even optically, Trump’s alliances with tech billionaires is crude and visible, but it mirrors the billionaires and influencers who flocked to Kamala Harris’s campaign,more of whompublicly backed her than Trump. Bidencontinued the practiceof previous presidents, Republican and Democrat, of tapping up super-rich donors for ambassadorial positions before Trump made the quid pro quo explicit with his cabinet of billionaires. And even the liberal argument that Trump’s mere temperament, character and disposition is self-disqualifying runs up against the fact of his predecessor. Biden’s stubborn clinging on to power, and people being asked to ignore their very eyes and ears as his capacities faded, proved that contempt for the public’s intelligence is not the preserve of the right.This is not to suggest thatthere is no difference between Trump and his predecessors, or that anyone is under any illusion that the US was a perfect democracy before his arrival on the scene. I do not mean to minimise the president’s violations and their material impact, most of all his lack of adherence to a peaceful transition of power – a super norm, if you will. But the American dream of prosperity at home and supremacy abroad has long masked a much more cynical and transactional order – one that Trump is both exposing and entrenching.The danger comes from assuming that Trumpism comes out of nowhere. In fact, it comes from many sources, but one of them is his predecessors’ creation of a political system in which serial breachesare seen as acceptable because they are done by the right people. Well, to millions of people, Trump is the right person.Nesrine Malik is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionUS politicsTrump administrationJoe BidenKamala HarriscommentShareReuse this content"

Jeremy Hunt, then the chancellor, said the £450m investment, plus £200m to expand its research facility in Cambridge, was “a vote of confidence in the attractiveness of the UK as a life sciences superpower”.There were additional reasons for the boosterish tone. Relations between the life sciences industry and the Tory government had been dire in the two years after the Covid pandemic. Companies grumbled about research and development tax credits, the NHS’s spending formula for prescription medicines and a post-Covid hangover in the health service’s ability to conduct clinical trials. The Speke deal seemed to signal a reset.AstraZeneca axes £450m vaccine plant in Liverpool, blaming state funding cutRead moreIt helped that the investment would be in vaccine-making capacity, the very thing the UK found itself lacking during the pandemic. And it was definitely useful that this was AstraZeneca. Only a year earlier, Soriot had blamed the UK’s “discouraging” tax rate for a decisionto build a separate £320m manufacturing plant in Irelandrather than the north-west of England.The only doubt over expansion at Speke came in the small print. The company’s final investment decision was “contingent upon mutual agreement with the UK government and third parties”. But that clause didn’t sound significant because both sides knew how the game was played. While at one level it is outrageous that a £175bn company such as AstraZeneca should expect a bung from the taxpayer, the reality in global pharma-land is that countries fall over themselves to offer incentives to build state-of-the-art facilities, especially the vaccine-making variety, that will be around for decades. You wouldn’t believe what Singapore will offer, pharma executives have said for years.Nowthe Speke investment is offand the precise reasons are disputed, inevitably. “Several factors have influenced this decision including the timing and reduction of the final offer compared to the previous government’s proposal,” said AstraZeneca. Did the incoming Labour government, wielding the Treasury’s “value for money” formula, have good reasons to trim the £90m offer from the Tories? Possibly, if it turned out that AstraZeneca’s R&D spend would be lower than expected.Yet the company’s reference to the timing of the final offer is significant, sources say. Note that the Timesreported last month, after obtaining correspondence under the Freedom of Information Act, that AstraZeneca’s UK chair had warned the incoming government soon after the general election last July that getting the deal over the line was “an urgent issue as we need to begin work on the project in August in order to meet our business case timelines”.Delay in Whitehall decision-making – as much as haggling over money – looks to have been key. If so, the timing of the general election didn’t help, but the killer may have been the failure to move quickly afterwards. The government can’t claim it was unaware of the risk of the investment slipping away. There were warnings aplenty, including fromthis column last August, that ministers should take the worsening mood music seriously and get the deal nailed down if it wanted to avoid being embarrassed.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But the bottom line here is that the outline terms were agreed and the goal was wide open.Viewed from abroad, it must look bizarre that the UK’s largest company and an “unashamedly pro-growth” UK government have not been able to complete a major investment in a life sciences sector that is supposed to have a starring role inthe new “modern” industrial strategy.

This year, you didn’t really need in-depth knowledge of the music industry or the Recording Academy’s internal machinations to work out what was going to happen, unless there was a major upset.1:51Grammy awards 2025: Beyoncé and Kendrick Lamar lead winners in aftermath of LA fires – videoAcross the previous 12 months, a succession of artists impacted in a way that pop music is no longer supposed to do. Its once-central defining role within broader popular culture is held to have been vastly diminished by social media, and yet Kendrick Lamar’s Not Like Us wasn’t just a huge commercial success, it influenced everything, from US sports to the campaign messaging of the American presidential election to sales of the fashion brands featured in its video: if you were going to dub anything the song of the year, it was obviously going to be that. Likewise, Charli xcx’sBrat, an album which caught a mood so completely, its title wound up a widely used (if nebulously defined) adjective: the notion of it ending the night unrewarded seemed fairly unthinkable (though it didn’t triumph in its biggest nominated categories).View image in fullscreenKendrick Lamar with his Grammys haul, including record of the year for Not Like Us.Photograph: Frederic J Brown/AFP/Getty ImagesGrammys 2025: the winners, the losers, the performances – as it happenedRead moreMoreover, Brat was part of a noticeable shift in the tone of mainstream pop music, away from impeccably styled, media-trained, Instagram-filtered perfection towards something messier, more heartfelt and personal, a state of affairs it would have been faintly nuts for the Academy not to recognise. This wasn’t merely the kind of trend that provokes think pieces from critics and ups the general quality of pop music – it was one that also sold millions of records by Sabrina Carpenter andChappell Roan, both of whom deservedly did well on the night. Should anyone doubt that a new mood in pop is abroad, it’s worth noting that Roan turned up to the ceremony wearing a wimple and drag-queen makeup and spent her acceptance speech excoriating the music industry for its unwillingness to provide young artists with a living wage in an era of record profits. You probably wouldn’t have expected that from the best new artist winner a few years back, but it’s exactly the kind of thing that Chappell Roan does: she’s both impressively outspoken and possessed of a very original take on how a pop star should look.View image in fullscreenOutspoken and original … Chappell Roan accepts her award for best new artist.Photograph: CBS Photo Archive/CBS/Getty ImagesElsewhere, you could certainly argue the Beyoncé albums that failed to snare the album of the year category in previous years were qualitatively better than the album that finally won it – certainly, 2016’s Lemonade and 2022’s Renaissance were more consistent and conceptually more coherent – but you’d be harder pushed to make a case thatCowboy Carterwasn’t impactful enough. For all it seemed to tire of its Beyoncé-goes-country theme midway through, throwing in everything from hip-hop to psychedelic soul, Cowboy Carter felt of the moment. It featured Shaboozey – ahead of his single A Bar Song (Tipsy) spending a record-setting 19 weeks at the top of the US chart – and it was part of the ongoing vogue for pop artists shifting their sound towards something more country-adjacent, unencumbered by the kind of this-isn’t-country dismissal from Nashville that famously dogged Lil Nas X’s similarly successful Old Town Road five years ago.Indeed, the closest the Grammys came to controversy – aside from awards for Chris Brown and Dave Chappelle, and a provocative appearance by Kanye West and his wife – was when it seemed most traditional, handing out the best rock performance gong to the Beatles forNow and Then. You could view that as merely an act of sentiment – Now and Then was, after all, dubbed “the last Beatles single”, a final leave-taking from the biggest band of all time – but there’s no getting around the fact that it was a rock performance that required AI to make it happen, previous attempts at extracting a usable vocal from John Lennon’s unfinished 1977 demo having failed because the equipment wasn’t up to it. The rights and wrongs of using AI in music have been hotly debated and one way you could read Now and Then’s success is as a tacit thumbs-up from the music business for a deeply divisive technology, or at least a hopeful suggestion that it might be a wonderful tool rather than a catastrophe for creativity. You have to admire their optimism.Explore more on these topicsGrammy awards 2025Kendrick LamarCharli xcxAwards and prizesChappell RoanThe BeatlesBeyoncécommentShareReuse this content"

These castles, ruins and other sites play an important part in people’s lives – particularly on weekends and holidays, when treasured memories are made. The value placed on access to these historic places can be seen from the fact that more than 1.3 million people are members.Stonehengehas 1.5 million visitors annually.It and other jewels in the charity’s crown will be left alone by the accountants. Winter closures are planned only at less-favoured sites where visitors are sparse, bosses have said. But given that membership, visitor and volunteer numbers are all up, it is concerning that the charity is so short of money that it may cut nearly 200 jobs.English Heritage is a less-glamorous cousin to the UK’s best-known buildings and landscapes charity,the National Trust(which operates in Northern Ireland and Wales as well as England). While the Trust, which wasfounded in 1895, has an elected council of members, English Heritage’s members get free entry and parking but no voting rights. Measured by members and income, English Heritage is roughly a fifth of the Trust’s size, and has existed in its current form since 2015.This was when David Cameron’s government decided to take away its government grant and spin it off as an independent entity. The optimistic gloss put on this was that it would enable the organisation “to grow with greater freedom”. Instead, just a couple of years after public funding was fully phased out, there is a real chance that the charity’s work will be degraded as a result of the need to make savings.A consultation with staff and their unions is ongoing. But MPs, members and anyone with an interest in the heritage sector should be dismayed by the prospect of the charity’s workforce being deskilled, if curators are replaced by by other staff, as has been reported. Tourists as well as local visitors expect high-quality information and displays at landmarks such as Dover Castle and Hadrian’s Wall. But these kinds of visits, combining historical education with pleasure (shops, cafes, children’s games), have been decades in the making – with roots in the postwar campaign to democratise leisure by opening up beautiful buildings that were previously the preserve of the very wealthy to the ticket-buying public.Experts are part of this winning formula. It is their knowledge that English Heritage, and other organisations, rely on when designing an experience – for example, the walk around the site of theBattle of Hastings– orupdating displaysto reflect contemporary concerns.English Heritage’s chief executive,Nick Merriman, has only been in post for a year. His aim will be to strengthen the organisation by recruiting more members and volunteers. The interest in Tudor England kindled by the BBC’s adaptation of Hilary Mantel’sWolf Hall trilogycould provide a boost to monasteries and abbeys such as Binham and Rievaulx. But with costs rising, it is not an easy task. Castles that have survived for hundreds of years can withstand a downturn in their keepers’ fortunes. But the historic public realm that they represent, like the rest of theculture sector, is in need of knights to defend it.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

If he succeeds, Nobel laureate Paul Krugmanwarns, it would be a 21st-century coup – with power slipping from elected officials’ hands. The real story hidden behind the president’strade war, he says, is the hijacking of government. And Mr Krugman’s right.By usurping the authority to shut down government programmes at will – even those funded by Congress – Mr Trump could slash federal spending and taxes while pretending to balance the books. In reality, he’d berobbingthe poor to enrich the wealthy. In a world where economic jargon has been corrupted to depict exploitation as “wealth creation”, the audacity of Mr Trump – and his lackeys – topersonallyprofit is breathtaking. Mr Trump’s philosophy is simple: let the uber-rich do whatever they want, with little or no oversight. The result will be vast wealth for a select few while life grows nastier and shorter for the many.His plan took shape last weekend when Mr Trump removed a top-ranking Treasury official who had been blocking his billionaire crony,Elon Musk, from accessing the federal payment system – exposing the sensitive personal data of millions of Americans, as well as details of public contractors who compete directly with Mr Musk’s businesses. The system disburses over $5tn annually, and Mr Musk and his allies, wrote analystNathan Tankus, are “clearly aiming to redesign” it to serve the Trumpian agenda – opening the door for the US president to seek retribution against his political opponents.To see the impact, look no further than one of Mr Trump’s first moves:freezingtrillions in federal spending – particularly on foreign aid, nongovernmental organisations, “DEI initiatives”, “woke gender ideology” and the “Green New Deal”. The courts blocked the measure as unconstitutional – but not before it wreaked havoc on government agencies and nonprofits, especially those aidingvulnerablegroups like homeless veterans. Mr Muskclaimshe will close the US agency for international aid (USAid) – but this remains moot as a federal body islegallyrequired to administer aid.Just like his trade war, Mr Trump’s claim to “impoundment” authority – the supposed right to unilaterally halt spending – exposes thecore contradictionof his power grab: he postures like amonarchbecause he’s too weak to govern as a president. He wields tariffs at will, bypassing Congress with “national security” claims – yet cut a deal with Mexico that both sidesspunas victory.In his first term, Mr Trump’sprotectionistcrusade – tariffs on China, a Nafta shake-up and attacking allies’ trade policies – was sold as a revolution. Instead, it was a self-inflicted wound. His administration slapped $80bn in new “taxes” on Americans through tariffs, only to see supply chains reroute to Vietnam and Indonesia rather than bring jobs back home. The real cost? A 0.2% hit to GDP and 142,000 jobs lost,accordingto the Tax Foundation. Without serious investment in domestic industry, the America First trade strategy didn’t rebuild US manufacturing – it just drove up costs. Mr Trump’s chaos isn’t confidence – it’s desperation. He’s trying to conjure power he doesn’t actually have. He is manufacturing a perception of dominance in the hope that Americans will simply accept it. The real danger is letting his illusion of power become reality.Explore more on these topicsUS politicsOpinionDonald TrumpElon MuskTrump administrationUSAidMexicoeditorialsShareReuse this content"

Plus, a letter byPaul McGilchristMon 3 Feb 2025 12.57 ESTLast modified on Mon 3 Feb 2025 13.00 ESTShareYour editorial (The Guardian view on the children’s bill: academy freedoms are beside the point, 30 January) is a welcome riposte to the academy lobby’s attempt to hijack debate on thechildren’s wellbeing and schools bill. We must focus on what we need to do to improve our school system and challenge the view that the past 14 years were a great success.Doubtful claims, without robust supporting evidence, that the bill will “destroy the huge gains made over the last decade and a half” have been widely repeated. Attention is often drawn to the opinions of CEOs of large academy chains. Evidenced comparisons between academies and maintained schools are rare, and reference is seldom heard, for example, of the fact thatUK 15-year-olds have the lowest life satisfaction scorein Europe.But other legacies are also not receiving attention: high levels of pupil absence and exclusions, unsustainable levels of teacher recruitment and retention, low teacher morale, the poor state of many school buildings, a crisis in provision for special educational needs and disabilities (Send) pupils, no progress on narrowing the attainment gap, a perverse accountability system that encourages off-rolling and an exam system that almost certainly contributes to the low levels of pupil satisfaction.The bill recognises some of the issues that our schools and children face, but there is much more to be done. Above all, we need to trust our teachers and treat them as professionals. It is crucial that Bridget Phillipson challenges those who are talking of “vandalism” and academy “style” being cramped. She must set out with evidence why the last 14 years have not been a great success and insist that from now on every child matters.Alasdair MacdonaldLondonThe criticisms being directed at the government’s proposals to restrict the freedoms of academy schools might carry more weight if they were accompanied by evidence that these freedoms have helped to raise standards (Who is criticising Labour’s new education bill – and why?, 29 January). Prof Stephen Gorard at the University of Durhamconcludes that“academy schools are no better at raising attainment than the (local authority) schools they replaced”.There isevidencethat academies have used their freedoms to employ younger and less experienced teaching staff, increasing numbers of whom are unqualified, whiledivertingmoney into the pockets of senior management. Furthermore,researchby the investigative journalistWarwick Mansellhas revealed that the 50 largest academy trusts, which educate the same number of pupils as the 10 largest local authorities, are spending almost three times as much on six-figure salaries for senior managers.The government is absolutely right to rein in academy freedoms.Michael PykeThe Campaign for State EducationA small but important point in your editorial, which refers to the Tory leader: “Mrs Badenoch’s jibe – are Olympians not qualified to teach PE? – was a rhetorical flourish, not a serious point.” The answer to such a question, from anyone claiming to understand education, pedagogy or learning should be a firm and unequivocal no. It rests on a simplistic, regrettably widespread, assumption. Brilliance is not evidence of the ability to teach, however gifted an individual may be in the skill in question.Paul McGilchristCromer, NorfolkExplore more on these topicsAcademicsSecondary schoolsTeachingChildrenSchoolsHouse of CommonsKatharine BirbalsinghlettersShareReuse this content"

It should look to Idris Elba, 30 January). Those of us in the youth and community sector have watched successive governments demolish our excellent universal, statutory service, leaving it hanging by the fragile thread of short-term, problem-focused charity funding.Isn’t it plain to see that social education is fundamental to steering young people towards sociable, conscious and contented lives? While youth work is not a panacea, it offers a curriculum based on understanding adolescence, building positive relationships and bringing out the immense talent and creativity of young people.Our work involved (and still involves for the remaining workers) actively reaching out to vulnerable, disenchanted, often angry children and young people, and isolated (sometimes just as angry) lone parents and older people. Social education used to be universally free for everyone.And who will pay? As the old adage goes: £1 in early life saves hundreds later, on prisons and psychiatric care, and prevents devastating human misery. It’s time to stop floundering. Bring back the universal, state-funded youth and community service and reinstate the dissolved programmes in colleges, councils and universities.Dr Annette RimmerManchesterDuring Idris Elba’s television programme on knife crime, it was hard to watch and learn about all the needless deaths (TV review, 29 January). With youth club funding slashed and high school exclusion, none of this was surprising. The young man who has come under the Community Initiative to Reduce Violence scheme, and was taken in by his favourite football team, has changed his life and moved away from knife crime.The funding for this scheme runs out soon. When clubs such as Manchester City can pay a certain football player £500,000 a week, isn’t it about time a small percentage should be taken to help this sort of programme across the country?Linda TheobaldLondonHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

But Spurs were able to talk him round, Postecoglou playing a key role, the player and his agent, Gadiri Camara, flying to London before the deadline to finalise the move.Tel fits the profile for Spurs’ project – specifically, that he is young and gifted – and Postecoglou can be relieved at his signing given how hard the club have been hit by injuries in recent weeks, the absentee list regularly running into double digits. Brennan Johnson, Dominic Solanke, Wilson Odobert and Timo Werner are the forwards currently out.The day brought confirmation of Postecoglou’s worst fears in another problem area – central defence – with Radu Dragusin facing a long-term absence with a torn anterior cruciate ligament. The Romanian sustained the damage in theEuropa League win against Elfsborglast Thursday.Spurs hadsigned the centre-half Kevin Dansofrom Lens on Sunday, taking him on loan with an obligation to buy for £20.9m in the summer but the Dragusin setback came on top of the situation with the club’s other specialists in the position – Cristian Romero and Micky van de Ven.Romero’s thigh problem is “tricky”, Postecoglou said, and it is not clear when he will be back, having been out since 8 December. Van de Ven, who injured his hamstring on the same date, made his comeback against Elfsborg, playing the first 45 minutes. But he was left out of the squadthat won at Brentford on Sundayamid fears that something was not quite right.It meant Spurs tried to sign another centre-back but they were unable to persuadeCrystal Palaceto sell Marc Guéhi, despite making an offer of £70m including bonuses. Guéhi, who starred for England during their run to the Euro 2024 final, will be out of contract in 18 months. Newcastle tried to sign him last summer and Chelsea looked at him this month. Liverpool are long-term admirers. Spurs will try again for him in the summer. Spurs also lost out to Aston Villa for the loan signing of the Chelsea central defender Axel Disasi. He simply preferred Villa.Tel’s signing was the boost. He can play across the frontline but is on record as saying his preferred position is as an inside left, where he can cut on to his stronger right foot. The former Rennes player, who is 6ft tall, is known for his good first touch, clever movement and readiness to shoot.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He made only 10 substitute appearances for the club, one of them in the 2-2 Europa Conference League draw against Spurs; his total minutes played was just 81.But Bayern had seen enough, also in his appearances for France at youth level, to pay €28.5m for him. Tel scored six goals in his first season at Bayern; 10 last time out plus six assists. The ability has been there for all to see, sometimes in sustained bursts. But it has simply not happened for him this season, partly because of the intense competition for forward places at Bayern. Hence the openness for a fresh challenge.Explore more on these topicsTransfer windowTottenham HotspurCrystal PalacenewsShareReuse this content"

West Ham, who played well and edged in front when Jarrod Bowen punished an error from Levi Colwill, had the meagre consolation of knowing they had given rivals with greater resources a scare.This was not convincing fromChelsea, even if they rose into the top four thanks to an equaliser from the excellent Pedro Neto and a Cole Palmer-inspired own goal from Aaron Wan-Bissaka. Enzo Maresca’s team were pallid for long spells and irritation was rising before a sudden surge overwhelmed an injury‑hit West Ham, who still summoned sufficient effort to rally and almost force an equaliser when Tosin Adarabioyo thwarted Mohammed Kudus in added time.Chelsea loan João Félix to Milan and Ben Chilwell to Crystal Palace in late flurryRead more“I was very happy because I consider tonight the toughest game mentally,” said Maresca, who was surprised to hear this was the first time since 2013 that Chelsea had won a home game after trailing at half-time. “You need to be patient. We conceded from our mistake. That’s when you need to be mentally strong. Second half we found more space and the guys from the bench were very good.”Perhaps the closure of the transfer window will restore calm to Chelsea, quietening the noise around their squad. There has been a weird vibe and deadline day had rolled on with João Félix flying to Milan, a loan in the offing, and Aston Villa agreeing to borrow Axel Disasi for the rest of the season. West Ham, meanwhile, were left counting the cost of two years of botched recruitment.The visitors had a threadbare feel with Lucas Paquetá and Edson Álvarez joining the injured contingent and Evan Ferguson not registered afterjoining on loan from Brighton. There were two full-backs in their back three, two goalkeepers on a light bench and a first start in midfield for Andy Irving, a 24‑year‑old Scot signed without fanfare from SK Austria Klagenfurt last year.West Ham still impressed. There were signs of Potter’s ideas taking hold, and a 3-4-2-1 system restricted Chelsea. Their best opening came from a counterattack which ended with Noni Madueke shooting narrowly wide.Chelsea strained to raise the tempo, with Palmer heavily marked. Marc Cucurella missed with a free header, Enzo Fernández dragged a shot wide, Jadon Sancho curled over and there was concern when Nicolas Jackson went down clutching his hamstring.View image in fullscreenJarrod Bowen’s neat finish gives West Ham the lead three minutes before half-time.Photograph: Dylan Martinez/ReutersWest Ham – short of firepower with Michail Antonio, Crysencio Summerville and Niclas Füllkrug missing – grew in confidence. Kudus threatened and Irving volleyed over. Bowen, leading the line with power and commitment after recovering from a broken foot, had two bites at turning in a corner. Filip Jörgensen denied West Ham’s captain.Jörgensen had received a huge cheer by fans delighted to see him replace Robert Sánchez. The Swedish goalkeeper was not entirely convincing, though, spilling an early cross from Irving. Chelsea, sleepy and vague, were asking for trouble.It was not a surprise when Kudus forced Colwill into a wayward backpass in the 42nd minute. The ball ran to Bowen, who raced clear to caress a lovely shot beyond Jörgensen.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionChelsea deserved to be behind. They almost levelled through Palmer, whose free-kick drew a stunning save from Alphonse Areola, but they needed more intensity in the second half. West Ham had more to offer than a relentless supply of ironic chants about Irving from the away end.Maresca soon put Neto on for the ineffective Sancho and introduced Marc Guiu for Jackson, who has gone eight games without a goal. Potter, meanwhile, was restrained on the touchline. It was left to Bruno Saltor, Chelsea’s interim coach for one game after Potter’s sacking, to complain about Colwill tripping Bowen in the buildup to the equaliser. “We feel it was a foul on Jarrod,” Potter said. “If we could have held out longer we could have sustained something.”The mood turned when Chelsea levelled. Neto crossed from the right, Cucurella turned the ball back and Fernández’s shot was blocked. Neto, hungry and alert, arrived to score. West Ham, hoping in vain that a VAR check would rule Guiu had touched the ball before it reached an offside Cucurella, geared up for a siege.Neto’s dynamism made an impact. Scrapping hard with Bowen, he won possession before Chelsea went ahead. The ball came to Palmer, he swerved past Tomas Soucek and his cross went in off Wan-Bissaka.West Ham brought on three inexperienced teenagers: Luis Guilherme, Oliver Scarles and Lewis Orford. Chelsea were invigorated by the £60m Neto and the France forward Christopher Nkunku. Even so there was concern at the state of Jackson’s hamstring and Guiu limping down the tunnel at full-time. Maresca hoped both forwards were fine but he has work to do.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueChelseaWest Ham Unitedmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Flex seems like a nice bloke. He’s clearly well informed on players and clubs. He seems to genuinely care about this stuff.On this occasion, however, he was thrown a genuine hospital pass, asked to stand next to a vast picture of Marcus Rashford’s head and talk about, well, basically, the entity that isMarcus Rashford. What is it? Is it good? What can it do? What do you think, Flex, about all this? Basically, Flex, just say Marcus Rashford words.Rashford unlikely to play for Manchester United again even if Amorim goesRead moreAt which point Flex found himself stuck in a kind of semantic logjam, reduced to repeating the words “Marcus Rashford” over and over again, at one point 10 times in a minute, eyes a little wide, saying things like: “Marcus Rashford has to do what’s best for Marcus Rashford if Marcus Rashford feels Marcus Rashford can still contribute to what Marcus Rashford wants now for Marcus Rashford.”This is not a criticism. Flex nailed it. He got out of there in one piece. It was in many ways an entirely logical response. Rashford’s late‑breaking move toAston Villahad yet to appear in the treeline. What else are you supposed to say about someone who is essentially just content, a brand, algorithm fodder?There is a kind of trap here, Flex’s Conundrum, which states that it is impossible to discuss Rashford properly because he doesn’t really play much football and isn’t that interesting when he does; at the same time it is also impossible to stop discussing him because he’s Marcus Rashford.This is what the digital noise‑world has given us. Andy Warhol defined a good photograph as one that’s in focus and of a famous person. Maybe a good modern football discussion is one that’s about a famous person, where that famous person’s name is clearly enunciated at least 10 times.In this sense Rashford is arguably the best example of a post-truth footballer. What we have here is a superstar without superstar achievements, superstar numbers or, let’s face it, superstar talent. But who is nonetheless a superstar all the same. His public existence is an extraordinary thing in an extraordinary time, when every act, every close-up, every twitch is spun out, pored over, given meaning, processed across every platform.This is not really how humans are supposed to exist, or what sport is supposed to be. Little wonder it is hard against this backdrop to assess exactly what a loan move to Aston Villa means, or how it’s likely to work out.View image in fullscreenMarcus Rashford was both popular and unpopular with Manchester United fans.Photograph: Martin Rickett/PAThe optics of Rashford’s unveiling video weren’t exactly promising. “I can’t wait for the first training session,” he said, looking heartbreakingly glum. “The sense of ambition is what is attractive,” he added later, with all the uncontainable excitement of a man discussing the slow and painful death of his beloved pet rabbit.And yet this is clearly the right thing for Rashford, if only because he just had to get out of Old Trafford before he was swallowed entirely by the machine.A move to Villarepresents clear lines. Unai Emery is a pragmatist. This is his show. There is no homegrown superstar mythology to muddy the epicure.Rashford will be asked to train and play with good footballers under a coherent coaching system, and to play in a defined role. What he has here is a clear matrix of success or failure, with numbered instructions on how to get there. Plus the chance to find out some things that sound disarmingly basic, from what is his actual position right down to how much does he actually want to do this.Is it a good thing for Villa? As a loan move the risks are relatively low. As are the potential rewards on the face of it. Villa have signed a player with three assists in his past 48 Premier League games, whose Emery-facing metrics – interceptions, tackles, indications of labour, effort, team play – are all way down. But this is also part of the fascination. It brings us back to the most basic question of all. Is he actually any good?It is a question that seems uniquely hard to ask, let alone answer. In part because Rashford is so popular (and also unpopular) with Manchester United fans; because he has a machinery of extreme celebrity at his back; and because of the unavoidable political sensitivities around a footballer who hasfought some vital battlesvia his social media channels.One thing bleeds into another. Even asking if Rashford is actually any good can feel a bit like announcing that you also run an inflammatory alt-right YouTube channel called Why Enoch Was Right About The Great Chem-Trail Vaccination Steal.But it is a fascinating question in its own right. If only because no other footballer presents such an obvious mismatch between celebrity status and on-field performance. That fame premium is clearly visible. Rashford is the fourth-highest-paid player in the Premier League, up there with Mohamed Salah, Kevin De Bruyne and Erling Haaland. Why? Even Casemiro, also in that company, has been world-class in the past.Whereas Rashford’s record is decent but not elite. In the Premier League he has 87 goals in 287 games, 40 assists across nine years, the same number as Jermaine Pennant, fewer than Brian Deane, Chris Brunt and Steed Malbranque. His supporters, fans, entourage, have taken to fudging this by saying, well, at his best he did have a 30-goal season. But did he?skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Either side he’s a 10-a-season man, unable to string together two good years. It used to be easy to see things like this, to allow people simply to be quite good but not great.Rashford is a talented player with excellent movement, when he actually moves, and eye-catching skills. But he’s also not as good as Cole Palmer, Harry Kane, Ollie Watkins, Jude Bellingham, Phil Foden, Anthony Gordon, Morgan Rogers, Eberechi Eze, Dominic Solanke. He’s not as good as Bryan Mbeumo, Cody Gakpo and various other less famous people there’s no space to list here.And yet Rashford is the conversation every time, to the extent he will now routinely complain about being the conversation, while failing to acknowledge that being undeservedly the conversation is also why he earns so much money, is so famous, and has an A-list career.This is a new phenomenon, the interference of fame in the internal metrics of sporting merit. It can also cause problems. In this respect Rashford is an example of something else, too: the Negative Value Player. There is value in having him. But there is value in not having him too, in not carrying all that noise.Rashford signing for Villa is good news for Arsenal, who were never interested enough and have two domestic loans already. It’s good news for Paris Saint-Germain, who have built a much-fanfared new identity around jettisoning the fame‑over‑substance footballer.Mainly it’s a great move forRuben Amorim, who has found himself caught early on by a process that gets its hooks into all United managers now, the urge to go to war with one of their own players, convinced that if they can just weed out Idle Star X, this might all suddenly start to work.This is football’s version of the Pardoner’s Tale, in which a group of drunken men decide the only way to escape death is to find death, who they have become convinced is an actual person, and to kill him, not realising this is impossible and they will naturally die in the process.Erik ten Hag’s death, his Rashford, was Cristiano Ronaldo. Getting rid of a 37-year-old celebrity poacher wasn’t going to solve the wonky structures that led to a 37‑year‑old celebrity poacher being in your team in the first place. But Ten Hag still had to fight that battle just as Amorim had to fight this one. If only because he seemed stuck at this first obstacle, unable to talk about anything else in his press conference, was becoming, like Flex, a man who says “Marcus Rashford” for a living.View image in fullscreenMainly this is a great move for Ruben Amorim, who went to war with one of United’s own.Photograph: Dave Thompson/APWho knows where this will end? Maybe when enough managers have fallen, enough idle senior players been slayed, death will finally be satisfied. But it is also important to remember Rashford didn’t make any of this happen, that theManchester UnitedEffect was inflicted on him too.Rashford was overplayed, overhyped, over-anointed as a very young man. His physical grace, his basic skills, his star power were misleading. He looked ready, but wasn’t ready. He never had time to grow, was expected to be The One right from the start, and did his best to keep running from there to here, as managers, teammates, systems, regimes came and went. A saner club and a saner surrounding industry would surely have made a better Rashford.There is still plenty of hope here. Villa are a great club, Emery an excellent manager. Rashford is talented enough to make this work. It will require discipline, hunger and a degree of personal and professional development. But he deserves a chance to find out how good he is; and above all a chance to be happy, nine years into one of the stranger sporting lives.Explore more on these topicsMarcus RashfordManchester UnitedRuben AmorimAston VillaTransfer windowanalysisShareReuse this content"

England, meanwhile, began theirSix Nationscampaign with a defeat in Ireland after another ­second-half capitulation last Saturday.Murley endured a mixed day on debut, scoring the opening try before twice attempting to carry the ball out from England’s in-goal area and putting his side under pressure in the process. He did not take part in England’s training session at their ­Bagshot base on Monday and is said to be struggling for the France game. In his likely absence, Ollie ­Sleightholme, Tom Roebuck and Elliot Daly could all come into the side while Freddie Steward could also shift to the wing.“You can’t underestimate how good a player [Dupont] is, but he’s human, he’s like everyone else, you take his legs and he goes down,” ­Freeman said.“It’s all about picking things up nice and early with him, putting him under pressure, and I’m sure like any other player when you put pressure on them they start to leak a few opportunities.“At the end of the day everyone is human, it’s rugby. They’ll have a gameplan, we’ll have a gameplan and we’ll back ours to the moon and back.”Ollie Chessum, who came off the bench against Ireland, is pushing for a start against France. He made his comeback from a long-term knee injury in Leicester’s 80-12 defeat by Toulouse last month – another match in which Dupont starred – and was part of the England side that crashed to a 53-10 defeat the last time France visited Twickenham.View image in fullscreenCadan Murley could miss the weekend’s match due to a foot injury.Photograph: Dan Sheridan/Inpho/ShutterstockAsked how to stop Dupont, ­Chessum said: “I don’t know, if I had the answers then I’d be one of the best paid coaches in the world. I suppose we’ve just got to treat it for what he is.“He’s an excellent player, but we’ve got excellent players in our team as well. We’ll bring our threats, I’m sure he’ll bring what he brings and we’ll see what happens on the weekend. We are playing France, not Toulouse this weekend – it is a different team.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The head coach will be tempted to shift Marcus Smith to full-back and hand a first start to Fin Smith given France’s propensity to kick long.“I play with Fin week in, week out,” Freeman said. “To play with Fin, I know his cues a little bit more, but I’ve been playing with Marcus a lot more now. There are different elements to different games, but ­Marcus runs a lot more and can create ­something out of nothing for you and give you the ball more in space.“They are different players and will bring different attributes of the game alive, and it’s exciting to play with both of them. With Marcus at full‑back, when he gets the ball in a bit more space he’s a bit more dangerous as well. I think it works nicely.”The former captain Jamie George is likely to return for the game against France, after being fast‑tracked back into the squad. The 34-year-old missed England’s training camp in Girona in the buildup to their Dublin defeat with a hamstring injury and was expected to miss the first two matches. He was summoned back into camp on Sunday night, however, and after taking part in Monday’syesterday’s session he is expected to feature in Saturday’s matchday squad.Explore more on these topicsSix Nations 2025England rugby union teamFrance rugby union teamSix NationsRugby unionnewsShareReuse this content"

Reports claim that a 70% stake has been agreed, 49% from the England and WalesCricketBoard with the rest from the county side.“We have been very focused on securing a great partner – ideally from the IPL – and RPSG has been our preferred bidder for some time,” read a statement from Lancashire. “We are delighted by the outcome and look forward to working together to create an exciting future. Together, we have a shared ambition to create a very special cricket team for the people of Manchester and the wider north west region.”RPSG’s successful bid comes after the owners of the Mumbai Indians landed a 49% share in Oval Invincibles on the opening day of the Hundred auction last week, worth around £60m. Northern Superchargers, Trent Rockets and Southern Brave remain on offer, with the sale of the Brave set to bring about further IPL involvement.

Assuming money is no object, what should they do to ensure they are competitive when they next face Australia in 2027? Here are six suggestions …1)Give the job to EdwardsBefore Jon Lewis wasappointed England’s head coachin November 2022 he had never worked in women’s cricket. Sometimes, an outsider can revolutionise a culture, but in this case Lewis tried to bring in “Bazball” values without understanding that what works in men’s cricket will not always translate into the women’s game.England need new leadership to move on from Women’s Ashes debacle | Raf NicholsonRead moreLewis will surely depart and his successor needs to understand the limitations and potential of the domestic setup, know the names of every single up-and-coming cricketer in the country, and not take any nonsense. Yes, I am talking about Charlotte Edwards. Offer her as much money as it takes to buy her out of her existing Hampshire, WBBL and WPL deals, and back her to the hilt – including in her own choice of captain – as she picks up the pieces of this Ashes debacle.2) Introduce a domestic red-ball tournamentThe Test match is the jewel in the crown of the Ashes. Winning it is worth four points. If England want to regain the Ashes in 2027, this should be an area of focus. As it stands, the domestic restructure means English players will participate in a Women’s T20 Blast and a Women’s One-Day Cup (as well as the Hundred), but what about adding a red-ball domestic competition?England could easily gain competitive advantage. Australia play no multiday domestic cricket. If they face an England team in the next Ashes who were regularly doing so, that could be an intimidating prospect.Of course the domestic schedule is becoming busier every season, so it may work best for a separate strand of players who are thought particularly suitable for longer-form cricket to compete in this, while others simultaneously go off to play in the Blast. Men’s cricket has red-ball and white-ball specialists, so why shouldn’t we?3) Fix the inability to play spinEasier said than done, but one thing we have learned is that a short, one-off camp in India with a handful of players (of the kind which Lewis organised in 2023) does not do any good. This is going to require a longer-term fix.View image in fullscreenAustralia are full of leaders such as Tahlia McGrath, second right, pictured holding the Women’s Ashes trophy.Photograph: Morgan Hancock/CA/Cricket Australia/Getty ImagesOne problem in England is that we tend to prioritise short-term over long-term success, which means that spinners who have excellent control but who do not turn the ball (such as Sophie Ecclestone and Sarah Glenn) are the ones who make it into the England setup. Hence why, when Alana King comes along and sends down a ripping leg-break, the English batters have no answers.We need to find the spinners in England who turn the ball the most (Hampshire’s 16‑year‑old leg-spinner Eve O’Neill looked promising in the recent Under-19 World Cup), fast-track them into the national setup, and nurture their talent. We also need to be patient. King spent years honing her craft, and made her debut for Australia at the age of 26.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

If your captain gets injured, you end up looking like headless chickens (asEngland did against West Indiesat the T20 World Cup).How to fix the problem? A female leadership programme, specifically tailored to mentor the next generation of leaders in English cricket. Australia have one. It is run by the former Australia captain and executive atCricketAustralia, Belinda Clark, and 27 of the 33 women who have graduated from it have gone on to hold leadership roles as captains in domestic, franchise or international cricket. That includes Tahlia McGrath – last seen stepping seamlessly into the shoes of Alyssa Healy when the Australia captain was injured halfway through the Ashes. Australia are a team full of leaders. England should be, too.5) Make everyone else more competitiveIt might sound counterintuitive, but the way to make the Ashes a better spectacle is to make other nations more competitive, to avoid the scenario where England are regularly thrashing countries such as Pakistan and New Zealand in bilateral cricket, and then crumble at the first sign of pressure during World Cups and Ashes series.ECB to carry out ‘thorough and honest’ review after Women’s Ashes whitewashRead moreTo change that, we need to go right to the top and alter the International Cricket Council’s revenue‑distribution model. First, revenue should be distributed much more equally among nations, to avoid perpetuating the “Big Three” dominance of England, Australia and India. Second, boards should be required to spend 50% of their revenue on developing their women’s teams, and be penalised for non-compliance by losing Full Membership status. The Ashes will always be iconic, but it should never be the only competitive bilateral women’s cricket.6) Improve the English weatherThe16-0 whitewashis explained easily by the fact that it rains a lot in England. We could start by sending our players to a surfing camp at Bondi. If that does not work, global warming ought to eventually do the trick.Explore more on these topicsEngland women's cricket teamWomen's cricketCricketanalysisShareReuse this content"

The driver asked them to pay for the cost of cleaning it up but they refused. After this, the driver called the police to complain about their behaviour and drove them to the Twickenham police station – instead of the original destination of Kerr’s home – on the advice of the emergency responder over the phone.On the way to the station, the taxi’s rear window was smashed.Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailPC Stephen Lovell and PC Samuel Limb were in a marked police vehicle driving towards the station and arrived at the same time as the taxi, about 2.20am.They saw broken glass on the road and a taxi parked up as they approached the station. The taxi driver honked his horn to alert the approaching officers.Kerr allegedly climbed out of the broken taxi window before she and Mewis approached the police car. They were taken inside the station while the taxi driver was kept outside.Inside the station, Kerr told Lovell that she thought the pair were being kidnapped before calling the officer “fucking stupid and white”.Speaking to the court, Lovell recalled the events of the night. Upon inspection of the taxi, he said “the bit of plastic that separates the passenger and driver’s seat” looked as if it had been kicked.After taking the pair inside the station, he said he “kept getting interrupted” and called Kerr “quite abusive”. He explained to them that they must pay the taxi driver for the damage they caused to his cab. In response, Lovell said Kerr “showed me her bank account on her phone”.In body-worn camera footage showing the pair visibly intoxicated inside the police station, Kerr claimed the taxi driver was “holding us against our will” and that the pair were being “held hostage in that cab”.Kerr said the taxi driver had been driving around for 20 minutes and “kept stopping and speeding up, stopping and speeding up”. Lovell said what the taxi driver had done, based on their words, did not constitute any offence.The pair claimed they had called the police while in the taxi, and Kerr repeatedly told Lovell to “listen to the recording” but officers said they had no record of the call. Kerr said neither she or her girlfriend, who is American, are from the UK, “so we don’t know the police number”.Kerr claimed they had got through to the police but the operator hung up. She continued to say she would not pay for the damage caused to the taxi, saying: “I’m not paying for some fucking dodgy cunt’s fucking window.”Kerr said: “This is a racial fucking thing. You are believing that guy out the front over £50. Listen to the fucking recording, this stupid cunt wouldn’t let us go.”She also accused the police of believing the taxi driver over “two women” and made multiple references to Sarah Everard,who was kidnapped, raped and murderedby a Metropolitan police officer.Kerr told Lovell to “put your shoes in a female’s shoes. We were trapped for 20 minutes in this guy’s car”.She went on: “You have to understand the emergency that both of us felt. Look at what happened last time when a woman accepted a police officer’s help in Clapham and got raped and killed.”Kerr also said she would “get the Chelsea fucking lawyers on this”. Mewis claimed the pair had told the taxi driver that they would pay him if he stopped, but he kept driving.After Lovell reiterated that they had no record of the pair calling 999, Kerr said: “You guys are stupid and white, you guys are fucking stupid and white.” Kerr then looked up at Lovell and said: “I’m looking you in the eyes, I’m looking you in the eyes, you guys are fucking stupid.”Lovell responded: “Why are you bringing race into this?”Kerr said: “I’m fucking over this shit. This is the world’s fucking problem. Wait on the call, wait on the call, wait on the call.”After these comments, Kerr was arrested for criminal damage and a racially aggravated public order. During her arrest, she told Lovell: “Believe women for once.” The criminal damage charge was dropped after the damage to the taxi was paid for.Grace Forbes, defending Kerr, said: “Nobody disputes the words that were said. But simply saying words, even words like these, does not make you guilty of a criminal offence. Sam Kerr did not feel hostile towards this officer because he is white.“The law is a little more nuanced, a little more human than that,” she added.The trial continues.Explore more on these topicsSam KerrAustralia sportChelsea WomennewsShareReuse this content"

One previous study showed changes over the scale of decades … and now we’re showing this happening on scales of five years,” said Dr Tom Chudley, an assistant geography professor at Durham University and lead author of the study.Since 1992, Greenland has been behind about14mm of sea level rise. According to scientists, this is due to the increased melting of ice in response to hotter weather, and the increased flow of ice in the ocean as a response to hotter ocean temperatures, both driven by climate breakdown.“We are confident that crevasses opening are related to the speed-up of the ice sheet. We’ve known for a number of years now that the ice sheet’s been accelerating quite significantly since 1990, and broadly we understand this to be related to ocean warming,” said Chudley.He hopes the high resolution mapping used in the study will begin to feed into other research in order to better project sea level rise.“Several of our large-scale models struggle to account for a lot of what we call dynamic instabilities,” he said. “These are things related to the glacier moving and getting faster … dynamic instabilities are causing potentially up to a metre of sea level rise by 2100, and 10 metres of sea level rise by 2300.“So, we desperately need to be better able to project sea level rise, because we need to be able to plan, to mitigate and adapt to sea level rise over the next three centuries.”Explore more on these topicsIceGreenlandClimate crisisClimate scienceSea levelOceansnewsShareReuse this content"

Now, a more tangible assault is gathering pace under Donald Trump – aimed squarely at wind, solar and other cleaner forms of power.In the first two weeks of his return as president, Trump has, like his first term,issued ordersto open up more American land and waters for fossil fuel extraction and started the process to yank the USfrom the Paris climate agreement. “We will drill, baby drill,” said Trump, who has promised to cut energy and electricity prices in half within 18 months.But Trump has this time also launched a blitzkrieg against renewable energy, with his department of interiortemporarily suspendingall clean energy development – but tellingly not oil and gas – on federal land.Meanwhile an “energy emergency”declaredby Trump mentions the need to bolster “crude oil, natural gas, lease condensates, natural gas liquids, refined petroleum products, uranium, coal” but not solar, wind or other clean energy technologies. Trump has said he would like to see “good clean coal”, the dirtiest of fossil fuels, meet the rising electricity demand from AI generation.Trumphas long disparaged wind energy, calling it “disgusting” andbaselesslyalleging turbines are the primary cause of whale and bird deaths, and his administration has now halted all federal approvals of onshore and offshore wind.“We don’t want windmills in this country,” the president recently told Fox News. “The wind blows and then it doesn’t blow, the things cost a fortune, they are made in China, they kill the birds, they’re horrible.”View image in fullscreenAn oil refinery in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, in 2020.Photograph: Barry Lewis/In Pictures/Getty ImagesHe then expanded his attack to solar, thefastest-growing energy sourcein the US. “You know what people also don’t like, those massive solar fields built over land that cover 10 miles by 10 miles,” Trump said. “I mean they are ridiculous, the whole thing.”Smaller-scale solar projects are also being suspended, with the new administrationfreezing$7bn in funding already awarded for community and rooftop solar in low-income communities.This broad-fronted promotion of fossil fuels – the Trump administration has also started toreversepollution standards for cars that encourage more electric sales, lifted a pause on gas exports and even floated therevivalof the moribundKeystoneXL oil pipeline – has delighted an industry thatdonated heavilyto the president’s campaign.“This is a new day for American energy,” said Mike Sommers, president of the American Petroleum Institute. “We applaud president Trump for moving swiftly to chart a new path where US oil and natural gas are embraced, not restricted.”But clean energy developers and climate advocates have been left stunned by the sharp turn against renewables. “From day one, Trump’s priority has been rewarding his corrupt fossil fuel donors and sabotaging America’s clean energy future,” said Sheldon Whitehouse, a Democratic senator.A White House spokeswoman did not answer questions as to the absence of renewables in this vision, instead pointing to a focus on “reversing the harmful and shortsighted policies of the previous administration”.The last Trump administration similarly sought tochampion fossil fuelsbut now there’s the “aggressive use of every imaginable presidential power” to favor them over renewables, according to Barry Rabe, an environmental policy expert at the University of Michigan.“Renewables largely just get in the way of these goals, the president sees no advantage in pursuing them,” said Rabe. “The rhetoric around wind energy isn’t new but it’s now particularly embittered. It’s really ratcheted up.”Rabe said the vast support for clean energy in the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), passed under Biden, “provides targets” that weren’t previously there for Trump to aim at. The president has called the bill “a giant scam” and has alreadypausedits spending that aids renewables, electric cars and batteries produced in the US.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines USFree newsletterGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Wind and solarsurpassedcoal for the first time last year and are expected to dominate freshly-added capacitythroughout 2025, with hundreds of thousands of new jobsturbocharged by the IRA’s tax credits.However, the US stilllags other countries, most notably in Europe and China, in deploying the renewables needed to avert the worst impacts of global heating and lessen the thousands of deaths and illnesses from fossil fuel air pollution. Analysts warn that political uncertaintyrisks underminingthe required clean energy roll-out and that any removal of the tax credits would severelydampen growth.View image in fullscreenSolar panels In Zaozhuang, China, in 2019.Photograph: Li Zongxian/VCG via Getty Images“This is all driven by culture war politics – Trump is attempting to strangle the US clean energy miracle in its crib so he can create a boogyman and be on top of a political moment,” said Paul Bledsoe, who was climate advisor to Bill Clinton’s White House.“It’s illogical because it destroys working class jobs and allows China to eat America’s lunch on clean energy. But as long as it meets his culture war objectives he indulges it.”Bledsoe said there will be “ferocious” lobbying in Washington over how much of the IRA to dismember, with Republicans faced with the choice of backing Trump or the clean energy investmentsoverwhelmingly flowingto their, rather than Democratic, districts. Thefour leading statesfor wind energy generation – Texas, Iowa, Oklahoma and Kansas – are also conservative bastions.“Oil and gas production will be driven by market circumstances but the real question is whether Congress will listen to this bullshit on renewables,” Bledsoe said. “Republican members know clean energy is a huge success story and the question is whether they will fall in line and repeal incentives because of this culture war. That is the crux of it and it’s unclear what will happen.”For now, the beleaguered clean energy industry has been left to plead its case in Trumpian terms, arguing that Republican calls for “energy dominance” and an “all of the above” energy strategy can’t be achieved while cutting out renewables.“No nation can achieve energy dominance absent consistent policy that moves beyond the idea that energy systems have partisan character,” said Jason Grumet, chief executive of American Clean Power, a trade lobby group.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpEnergySolar powerWind powerOilRenewable energyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Facing criticism that the UK had been vague in its hopes for this pact, he said it should cover military technology, research and development, improved mobility of forces acrossEurope, protection of critical infrastructure and deepening industrial collaboration to boost production.Starmer’s EU dinner date a big moment in tricky tightrope actRead more“We can’t be commentators when it comes to matters of peace on our continent,” he told reporters. “We must lead and that’s what I’ve determined that we will do.”Starmer was speaking at Nato headquarters after meeting the alliance’s secretary general, Mark Rutte, who reiterated that allies needed to spend “considerably more” than the current target of 2% of GDP.Later, over a dinner of celeriac soup and sea bream, Starmer told European leaders he wanted deeper EU-UK cooperation against state threats and sabotage. He raised the issue followinga spate of incidents where subsea cables were damaged, raising suspicions of Russian or Chinese state-sponsored sabotage.With the French president, Emmanuel Macron, calling for a “buy European” armaments policy, Starmer urged EU leaders not to exclude the UK from spending plans. “Fragmentation would weaken us all,” he said, according to remarks released by Number 10. “Instead, let’s maximise the industrial weight and clout that we have together.”In calling for deeper defence industry collaboration, the prime minister cited the European aerospace and defence company Airbus and the French defence firm Thales - the latter employs 7,000 people in the UK. “Look at Airbus or Thales – their success in the UK boosts defence across Europe,” he said.After dinner, the European Council president, António Costa, told reporters that “everyone was delighted to welcome Sir Keir Starmer … and to say clearly that the United Kingdom and theEuropean Unionare reliable and predictable partners”.Costa said he expected the EU and UK to hold a summit in the UK on 19 May to build “the closest relationship it will be possible to build together”.But a majority of member states are demanding the UK sign up to the EU’s demands on fishing rights and a youth mobility scheme as part of a broader package to reset the relationship, including security.Managing the negotiations will fall to the European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen, who sidestepped a question on the sequencing of talks. She said it was “very good to have a thorough discussion with prime minister Keir Starmer because European security concerns us all inside and outside the European Union”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Poland has the EU’s rotating presidency and Tusk said it was his idea to invite Starmer to have the UK as “close as possible” on security issues and “to find ways to eliminate or reduce barriers in trade between the UK and Europe”.Before Starmer arrived, the EU27 held day-long talks to discuss defence, but the meeting wasovershadowed by Trump’s threats to impose tariffs on the bloc.Asked earlier in the day whether he was worried by Donald Trump’s refusal to rule out hitting the UK with tariffs, the prime minister said “obviously, it’s early days”.“I think what’s really important is open and strong trading relations and that’s been the basis of my discussions with President Trump,” he said. “I know that intense US-EU discussions are planned.”UK government officials have already drawn up retaliatory tariffs that could be quickly imposed on US goods if Trump decided to start a trade war.Starmer said the UK did not have to choose between the EU and the US, when asked if he would weaken his reset with the bloc to keep Trump happy. “Both of these relations are very important to us. We are not choosing between them, but that’s historically been the position of the UK for many, many decades.”The Nato secretary general downplayed Trump’s tariff strategy and looming trade war, saying he was “absolutely convinced” Nato could deal with trade tensions between the US and Canada. Rutte said European defence without Nato was “a silly thought” and would not work.Arriving at the dinner, Starmer said rejoining the EU was not going to happen, but there could be “a better, closer relationship when it comes to trade and security”.His trip to Brussels came as Reform ​t​ook a lead overLabourfor the first time in a national opinion poll​. ​A Sky News/YouGov poll​ released on Monday evening put Nigel Farage’s party on 25%, a point ahead of Labour. It also found one in five people who voted Conservative at the last general election would now vote for Reform.Explore more on these topicsForeign policyKeir StarmerEuropean UnionBrexitUK security and counter-terrorismLabourEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Despite the efforts of paramedics he died a short time later.Harvey Willgoose.Photograph: XPolice said another 15-year-old boy had been arrested on suspicion of murder and was in custody.Officers were called shortly after 12.15pm on Monday, and emergency services, including an air ambulance, were dispatched to the scene on Granville Road.Friends laid flowers on a wall outside the school along with balloons and an England flag.One handwritten card described Harvey as “the life of the party” who “brought joy and laughter to everyone who knew him”.“His bubbly personality was contagious, you could always hear him down a corridor,” it read. “I’ll never forget all the torments, all the laughs. You’ll be missed by so many.”View image in fullscreenOfficers outside the school where the victim died. He ‘brought joy and laughter to everyone who knew him’, one tribute said.Photograph: Joel Goodman/The GuardianOutside a local sports club, more flowers had been left, with several heart-shaped balloons and two large red balloons in the shape of the number 15.An ambulance and police cars were still behind the school gates on Monday evening, where officers in white forensic suits were working into the night.In a message to parents, the headteacher, Sean Pender, said two students had been involved in the incident.“I am writing to inform you that today we have dealt with an extremely serious incident here in school resulting in us going in to a lockdown procedure,” he said. “The incident involved two students, one of whom we believe has been seriously injured. All other students are contained and safe.“I understand the level of anxiety you will be feeling without knowledge of the nature of the incident, but at this time I have limited information to share with you whilst we have police and paramedics on site.” He asked parents for “your prayers and support at this time”.TheSheffield Heeley MP, Louise Haigh, said “serious questions will have to be answered” after the stabbing.“Horrific news that the young pupil from All Saints high school has died,” she posted to Facebook.“All my thoughts are with his family and friends, and the entire community at All Saints. A teenager is in custody and South Yorkshire police have assured parents that there is no ongoing risk at the school.“A criminal investigation will now obviously take place, but serious questions will have to be answered about how this could have happened and I will be working with the school, the police and the council to make sure they are.”South Yorkshire’s mayor, Oliver Coppard, said: “This morning a teenage boy went to school like thousands of others across South Yorkshire but won’t come home; a young man who was a member of our community, with his whole life ahead of him.“My love, my thoughts and my prayers are with his family and friends, and the whole community of All Saints Catholic high school.”Coppard, who has police and crime commissioner responsibilities, added: “The vast majority of our young people don’t carry knives, but one incidence of knife crime is one too many because, when we do see knife crime happen, all too often the consequences are utterly devastating, as they have been today.“I have spoken to the chief constable and offered her my full support as she carries out her investigation and continues to do everything she can to prioritise tackling knife crime across South Yorkshire.”It was the second time in a week that the school had been put in lockdown, theSheffield Star reported. Staff and students were told to “stay put” because of “threats of violence” between a small number of students on Wednesday last week.Those involved were reportedly escorted off the premises, without any incidents of violence or anyone being injured.The knife crime campaigner Anthony Olaseinde said he had worked with the school previously and “they have always been forthcoming on the issue”.“Some schools shy away from the issues, but we have done projects with All Saints, and they have always got involved with us,” he said.The school has about 1,300 pupils aged between 11 and 18.Keir Starmer said his “first thoughts as prime minister and as a father are with the family”. He added: “I think the whole country would want to reach out to the family, the friends, to the school, the entire community, in their grief and mourn with them.”A spokesperson for South Yorkshire police said: “Following a stabbing at a school in Sheffield, a teenage boy has been detained by police and our officers are on scene.“We would like to reassure parents of pupils that we do not deem there to be a further risk at the school and further updates will be shared when possible.”Explore more on these topicsEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

I didn’t want him to go but his heart was set on it. He wanted to help Ukraine,” his father, Graham,told the Sun.“I’ve been told bits of the story of how he died, but have struggled to deal with it and wish we could have swapped places because he had his whole life in front of him.”Small and lethal: adapted drones carrying explosives ‘hunt’ civilians in KhersonRead moreBefore boarding the plane, Graham told the newspaper Wilton had spent an hour saying goodbye to his mother, Kerrie-Anne, 44, who had also tried to dissuade their son from going to Ukraine.Wilton, whose parents are separated, had two sisters, Sophie, 22, and Sarah, 21. He had finished a two-year course in animal welfare and land care before deciding to travel to Ukraine.He was cremated in Ukraine after his death on the eastern front, with his father travelling from the UK to attend the funeral.View image in fullscreenWilton’s funeral was held in Ukraine.Photograph: PA“He was such a laid-back, polite, easy-going and likable young man – I’ll always be proud of him. I brought his ashes back home, but might go back to scatter them there. I think that might be what he would have wanted,” Graham said.“It’s taken a while to process James’s death. But I think it’s time that some kind of public tribute was paid and it’s good to be finally talking about what happened.”Wilton’s friend, a US volunteer fighter and medic named only as Jason, told the Sun he was with him when he died.“It was James’s first and last mission,” he said. “We had to cross an open field with no trees, no cover, nothing, to resupply other soldiers. “I was team leader and there were six of us traversing in groups of two, 20 metres apart. Myself and James were the last two.”Jason described seeing Wilton stop in the field, before then also noticing the drones flying 20 metres overhead.Jason survived the attack, but lost his foot four days later when he stepped on a landmine. “I extracted my friend James from the battle and he died. It’s hard not getting emotional about it, but seeing that made me want to try harder to help others,” he said.“He was the youngest in our group and we all felt protective towards him and I suppose I came to see him like a little brother.“I think he had thought to himself ‘I’m not doing much with my life, I want to do something bigger for the greater good.’ I still miss him and I’ll never forget him.”A Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office spokesperson said:“We provided consular assistance to the family of a British man who died in Ukraine.”Explore more on these topicsHuddersfieldUkraineWest YorkshireRussiaEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Whether it’s four, five, six, seven, 10 goals, I’m seeing it through now. We ended up giving away 300 pints.”‘Win the league? It feels possible’: Nottingham Forest fans dare to dreamRead moreIt was only about 45 minutes before kick-off when Webster decided to create the offer at her pub, The Gedling Inn, which she has been running for the past six years. Having only recently got TNT Sports installed on the TV, she was keen to make the most of being able to broadcast the Nottingham Forest game live.“FREE PINT WHEN FOREST SCORE!!”, read the post on Instagram, issued about 20 minutes before the team’s Premier League match against Brighton started at 12.30pm on Saturday.The first goal hit the net after 12 minutes, and they soon started coming thick and fast – thefinal score was 7-0 to Nottingham Forest, to much jubilation among the football fans gathered in the pub.“It was just pure adrenaline. We were running with the fact the pub was so vibrant, everyone was happy,” said Webster’s partner, Cassian Prime, who runs the pub alongside her. “Coming off the back ofa five-nil loss[the previous weekend], to see everybody happy and cheering and dancing and singing, it was absolutely amazing.“A lot of the punters were our regulars anyway, so they were almost just laughing at us. They were lining up, getting the pints, and they’d literally put the pint on the table and another goal would go in. There were just lots of belly laughs.”As the seventh goal went in, the couple poured themselves a drink and joined in.Prime had been away from the pub that day, working on some house renovations, and was unaware of the free pint promotion until his phone was inundated with messages.“My phone was like a hot potato, it was pinging away with people saying, ‘you’re a legend, we can’t believe you’ve done it, you guys are class,’ and I had no idea what they were talking about,” said Prime.“So I went to the pub and it was in uproar, and Beccy came creeping from downstairs and told me. At this point it was 3-0, so I just thought hopefully we sit back, we defend, and try to hold on to the lead. Instead, we went and scored another four.”The couple said that, despite the hefty bill, they don’t regret the decision. Their story has been reported across the globe, and brought an unprecedented level of attention and new customers to the pub.As Webster speaks, a group of Nottingham Forest fans walk through the door, hoping to get a selfie with the owners of the now-famous venue.“The pub has gone globally viral, we’ve been contacted from people in South Africa and France and Brazil. So for the £1,500, approximately, that it cost us, the publicity that’s come with it is quite a bargain,” said Prime.They also joked that Nottingham Forest FC might help cover the costs. “The owner has got enough money to come and pay the bar tab, so if he could get in touch, we could sit and have a pint together or something,” said Webster.In the meantime, they’re mulling over whether to continue with the promotion for future matches. “I think we definitely want to roll with the momentum – I’m not sure whether we could do the free pints again for every goal but you never know,” said Webster. “We’ll see what backing we get.”Explore more on these topicsNottinghamNottingham ForestnewsShareReuse this content"

After winning the general election, Labour moved to reduce the amount of public money available to £40m, before raising it again in the autumn.Bryant said the difference between the government’s final offer and Hunt’s had been “remarkably small”, but did not put a number on it.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It doesn’t feel like something I would do,” she said.Swansea crown court heard the teenager, who was 13 at the time of the incident, attacked the teachers during the morning break. She then moved on to stab another girl before being restrained by staff.All three victims survived the attack. Hopkin, who was stabbed in the neck, had to be flown to Cardiff by air ambulance.Explore more on these topicsCrimeKnife crimeWalesSchoolsTeachingnewsShareReuse this content"

He died at Bristol children’s hospital on 17 April.The inquest continues.Explore more on these topicsNHSBristolHealthChildrennewsShareReuse this content"

At the time he was being held on remand for spying charges.Daniel Khalife: a fantasist or a player in the world of spies?Read moreLast November, a jury at Woolwich crown court found him guilty of breaching the Official Secrets Act and the Terrorism Act by passing on information to Iran while he was serving in the army. During his trial he also admitted escaping from prison before his capture on a canal towpath by a plainclothes detective. He was cleared of carrying out a bomb hoax.On Monday, Mrs Justice Cheema-Grubb sentenced him to 14 years and three monthsat Woolwich crown court.The sentence involved six years each for breaking the Official Secrets Act and the Terrorism Act, and a further two years and three months for escaping from prison. The sentences will run consecutively, the judge said. An older man committing these offences would have had a noticeably longer sentence, she added.In her sentencing remarks, Mrs Justice Cheema-Grubb said: “Deterring others from similar behaviour must be the primary aim of this sentence.” The judge said Khalife was motivated by a “selfish desire to show off”.The trial heard how Khalife had “exposed military personnel to serious harm” by collecting sensitive information and passing it on to Iranian agents for cash.The judge said Khalife had exploited a security flaw in the army personnel computer system to screenshot the names of soldiers, including seven in the special forces. She said this was a “very serious example” of a breach of anti-terror laws.Prosecutors said Khalife played “a cynical game”, claiming he wanted a career as a double agent to help the British intelligence services, when in fact he gathered “a very large body of restricted and classified material”.Mr Justice Cheema-Grubb said:“Having taken an oath of allegiance, you were motivated by a personal grievance to betray your colleagues and superiors. Your conduct was premeditated and continued for over two years.“You were aware that the Iranians had technology which could access your mobile phone and track where you, and by direct inference, your colleagues were serving. Although it may be that some of your early material was bogus and of no direct importance, you did not stop when you realised that the domestic security services were not going to respond to your overtures.”She added: “The mere fact that you started on this dangerous and fantastical plan demonstrates your immaturity and lack of wisdom. That you thought it was appropriate to insert yourself – an unauthorised, unqualified and uninformed junior soldier into communication with an enemy state – is perhaps the clearest indication of the degree of folly and your failure to understand at the most obvious level the risk you posed.”Defending, Gul Nawaz Hussain KC said Khalife’s spying activity was amateurish, describing it as more “Scooby Doo than 007”. Some documents Khalife forged to pass to the Iranians were “laughably fake”, Hussain told the court.He told the judge: “What Daniel Khalife clearly chose to do was not born of malice, was not born of greed, religious fervour or ideological conviction. His intentions were neither sinister nor cynical.”After asking the defendant to stand up in the dock, the judge said: “Daniel Khalife. When you joined the army as a young man you had the makings of an exemplary soldier. However, through the repeated violation of your oath of service, you showed yourself to be, instead, a dangerous fool.“The only sentence open to me is one of immediate custody. Anyone who is prepared to betray his country and subject serving soldiers to an increased risk of harm must be punished in respect of deterrence.”Explore more on these topicsEspionageIrannewsShareReuse this content"

But Phillipson said it was also up to parents to play their part.“It’s not just about your responsibility to your own child, but about the responsibility you have to the whole school community and wider society,” she said.“The decisions you take as an individual parent not to send your children to school impact the education of all children in the class.”View image in fullscreenSchool attendance in England has fallen significantly since the Covid-19 pandemic.Photograph: Monkey Business Images/ShutterstockPhillipson was answering questions after a speech on Monday in which she outlined “a new era of school standards”. At the same time, she rejected widespread criticism of planned changes to the school inspection system,revealed by Ofstedon Monday, which appeared to set her on a collision course with union leaders.She repudiated the suggestion that parents would not be able to understand the more “granular” report card system, due to be introduced in England later this year, and insisted the reforms would lead to “stronger” and “clearer” inspections.In a pointed message to teaching unions, who said Ofsted’s proposals were worse than the system they were intended to replace, she insisted her first responsibility was to children.“There’s been a lot of discussion about how I, as secretary of state, am apparently in hock to the trade unions,” she said. “I think we’ve seen today, from the reaction to what we’re setting out, that that’s very far from the truth.“I will always seek a constructive relationship with trade unions representing our teachers and workforce. They’ve got an important role to play. But my first priority will always be children and their life chances.”Phillipson also fleshed out her plans to improve schools with the introduction of Rise (regional improvement for standards and excellence) teams to tackle 600 “stuck” schools, responsible for the education of 300,000 children.She said that each of these schools would get up to £100,000 in specialist support, and added that she would not flinch from turning failing schools into academies. “Stuck schools are the new front in the fight against low expectations,” she said.“I will not accept a system that is content for some to sink, even while others soar. The opportunity to succeed must be the right of every child. We simply can’t allow stuck schools to disappear off the radar.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Quite simply, you cannot have an improving school system while you are implementing austerity.”Under Ofsted’s new proposals, schools will be graded in eight individual areas on a five-step scale, ranging from “exemplary” to “causing concern”. A separate evaluation will address whether safeguarding standards were met. Inspections currently look at four to six areas including safeguarding, on a four-step scale from “outstanding” to “inadequate”.The reforms were precipitated by the suicide of Ruth Perry, a head teacher at Caversham primary school in Reading, after an Ofsted inspection. Perry’s sister, Prof Julia Waters, said: “Ofsted’s proposed new inspection model has some improvements but retains many of the dangerous features of the previous system, while introducing a series of changes with potential new risks to the wellbeing of teachers and headteachers.”In the UK and Ireland,Samaritanscan be contacted on freephone 116 123, or emailjo@samaritans.orgorjo@samaritans.ie.

We want to make it small, we want to make it a footnote.”Germans protest against party leader who pushed migration bill backed by far rightRead moreReferring to the tens of thousands of demonstrators who turned out in cities acrossGermanyat the weekend to criticise Merz’s high-stakes gamble with the AfD, the CDU leader took a startlingly aggressive approach, accusing the protesters of hypocrisy.Merz demanded: “I want to know: where is the uprising of decent people?” in the face of a “never-before-seen hatred of Israel” since the 7 October attacks by Hamas and “an antisemitism that deeply shames us all … against which the reaction has been too hesitant”.“I say to all those who were out yesterday: you picked the wrong date and the wrong issue,” he said.View image in fullscreenPeople marched in cities including Berlin (pictured) on 2 February to protest against Merz’s migration plans and cooperation with the far-right Alternative for Germany party (AfD).Photograph: Annegret Hilse/ReutersDrumming home a law-and-order message in the last weeks of the campaign, Merz argued that mainstream parties had to offer a tougher response to violent crimes, such as last month’sdeadly stabbing attackagainst small children in the southern city of Aschaffenburg, or risk losing ground to extremists.“The open outbreaks of violence on our streets and in well-known parts of town around certain events such as New Year’s Eve and May Day undermine the faith of our population in the rule of law and allow our state to often appear powerless and defenceless,” he said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Crews early on Monday could be seen onboard a vessel with a crane.Victims of the Washington DC plane crash – the full list so farRead moreMore than 300 responders weretaking part in the recovery effortat any given time, officials said. Two navy barges were also deployed to lift heavy wreckage.Divers and salvage workers are adhering to strict protocols and will stop moving debris if a body is found, Col Francis B Pera of the army corps of engineers said on Sunday. The “dignified recovery” of remains takes precedence over all else, he said.Portions ofthe two aircraftthat collided over the river on Wednesday night near Ronald Reagan Washington National airport – an American Airlines jet with 64 people onboard and an army Black Hawk helicopter carrying three – are being loaded on to flatbed trucks and will be taken to a hangar for investigation.The crash occurred when the jet, en route fromWichita, Kansas, was about to land. The Black Hawk was on a training mission. There were no survivors.On Sunday, family members were taken in buses with a police escort to the Potomac River bank near where the two aircraft came to rest after colliding.The plane’s passengersincluded figure skaters returningfrom the 2025 US Figure Skating Championships in Wichita and a group of hunters returning from a guided trip. Staff Sgt Ryan Austin O’Hara, 28, of Lilburn, Georgia; Chief Warrant Officer 2 Andrew Loyd Eaves, 39, of Great Mills, Maryland; andCapt Rebecca M Lobach, of Durham, North Carolina, were the servicemembers in the helicopter.Federal investigators were working to piece together the events that led to the collision. Full investigations typically take a year or more. Investigators hope to have a preliminary report within 30 days.Wednesday’s crash was thedeadliest in the USsince 12 November 2001, when a jet slammed into a New York City neighborhood just after takeoff, killing all 260 people onboard and five on the ground.Experts stress that plane travel is overwhelmingly safe, but the crowded airspace around Reagan National airportcan challenge even experienced pilots.The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) said on Saturday that preliminary data showedconflicting readingsabout the altitudes of the airliner and the helicopter.Investigators also said that about a second before impact, the jet’s flight recorder showed a change in its pitch. But they did not say whether that change in angle meant that pilots were trying to perform an evasive maneuver to avoid the crash.Data from the jet’s flight recorder showed its altitude as 325ft (99 meters), plus or minus 25ft (7.6 meters), when the crash happened, NTSB officials told reporters. Data in the control tower, though, showed the Black Hawk at 200ft (61 meters), the maximum allowed altitude for helicopters in the area.The discrepancy has yet to be explained.Investigators said they hoped to reconcile the difference with data from the helicopter’sblack boxand planned to refine the tower data, which can be less reliable.Explore more on these topicsWashington DC plane crashWashington DCPlane crashesUS militarynewsShareReuse this content"

Four states ban the procedure past six weeks of gestation, before most women know they are pregnant.Non-profits, such as Aid Access, have responded by providing medication abortion to women in all 50 states using “shield laws” – protections passed by states friendly to reproductive rights that prevent healthcare providers from legal consequences in abortion-ban states.In Gallego’s letter, the senator describes how Aid Access had posts removed fromFacebookand blurred on Instagram. The organization was also locked out of Facebook and briefly suspended from Instagram.The experience mirrors that of other medication abortion organizations, such as telehealth clinic Hey Jane, whose spokespersontold the Guardianthat Instagram made its posts harder to find. Other groups, Women Help Women and Just the Pill,told the New York Timestheir accounts were suspended and restored.“I am also troubled by the timing of these events,” said Gallego, in the letter. “Taken together, Meta’s decision to end fact-checking, while simultaneously restricting access to content related to abortion, looks like a calculated move to avoid the ire of President Trump, a well-known opponent of both abortion and attempts to limit mis- and disinformation.”Gallego asks Meta for its “rationale” for removing content related to abortion; why it was removed “specifically in the weeks” following Trump’s election victory, and whether the removals were in “specific states” or nationally.In a statement, a Meta spokesperson told the Guardian when the removals were first reported: “These groups encountered both correct enforcement and a variety of issues, including over enforcement and a technical bug, that resulted in the blurring of some posts. But we’ve been quite clear in recent weeks that we want to allow more speech and reduce enforcement mistakes – and we’re committed to doing that.”Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationAbortionMetaFacebookHealthUS politicsDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

The researchers also found the tiny particles in liver and kidney samples.The human body is widely contaminated by microplastics. They have also been found inblood,semen,breast milk,placentasandbone marrow. The impact on human health is largely unknown, but they have beenlinked to strokes and heart attacks.Graph showing the increase in microplastic levels in brain samples from 2016 to 2024The scientists also found that the concentration of microplastics was about six times higher in brain samples from people who had dementia. However, the damage dementia causes in the brain would be expected to increase concentrations, the researchers said, meaning no causal link should be assumed.“Given the exponentially rising environmental presence of micro- and nanoplastics, this data compels a much larger effort to understand whether they have a role in neurological disorders or other human health effects,” said the researchers, who were led by Prof Matthew Campen at the University of New Mexico in the US.Microplastics are broken down from plastic waste and have polluted the entire planet, from thesummit of Mount Everestto thedeepest oceans. People consume the tiny particlesvia food,waterand bybreathing them in.A study published on Thursday found tiny plastic pollution to be significantlyhigher in placentas from premature births. Another recent analysis found thatmicroplastics can block blood vesselsin the brains of mice, causing neurological damage, but noted that human capillaries are much larger.The new research,published in the journal Nature Medicine, analysed samples of brain, liver and kidney tissues from 28 people who died in 2016 and 24 who died in 2024 in New Mexico. Microplastic concentration was much higher in the brain tissue. It was also higher in brain and liver samples from 2024, compared with those from 2016.The scientists extended the analysis with brain tissue samples from people who had died between 1997 and 2013 on the US east coast. The data showed an increasing trend in microplastic contamination of brains from 1997 to 2024.The most common plastic found was polyethylene, which is used in plastic bags and food and drink packaging. It made up 75% of the total plastic on average. The particles in the brain were mostly nanoscale shards and flakes of plastic. The plastic concentrations in the organs were not influenced by the age of the person at death, or the cause of death, their sex or their ethnicity.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDetox Your KitchenFree weekly newsletterA seven-week expert course to help you avoid chemicals in your food and groceries.Enter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Now, after just 10 days of Donald Trump’s executive orders and civil service purges, the advice is beginning to flow the other way.When Serbians toppled the dictator Slobodan Milošević in a revolution in 2000, they had left autocracy behind, but the country’s fragile democracy has shrunk steadily over the past few years under the current president, Aleksandar Vučić. Their lesson is to take nothing for granted.Trump’s revenge agenda has shocked officials who ‘didn’t think it was going to be this bad’, insiders sayRead more“I never liked the metaphor of the frog in a slowly boiling water, but it applies very well to our situation,” Srđan Cvijić at the Belgrade Centre for Security Policy said. “One decision at a time, our regime has strippedSerbiaof its democratic system. It didn’t come overnight. First they captured the media, then the judiciary, then other independent institutions, then they started rigging the elections, and finally they are trying to strip us of the right to freedom of assembly.“So my advice to Americans is never relax, always be on guard, democracy is not given, not even in the land of the free,” Cvijić said. “Things can go backwards, you have to fight daily for your rights, otherwise someone will take them away from you.“The most important thing to defend is solidarity and human decency,” Cvijić added. “Do not allow the enemies of democracy to lower your own standards of political behaviour.”View image in fullscreenOpposition supporters attend an event in Budapest on 23 October 2023, to commemorate the Hungarian uprising against Soviet occupation.Photograph: Peter Kohalmi/AFP/Getty ImagesMárta Pardavi, the co-chair of the Hungarian Helsinki Committee, has a similar message. She too has long experience of peaceful resistance todemocratic backsliding. Since first being elected as prime minister in 2010, Viktor Orbán and his Fidesz party have aggressively hollowed out the independence ofHungary’sjudiciary, media, and waged lawfare against civil society.Pardavi said it was important to dodge the trap of mirroring the political tactics of those in power.“Avoid siege mentality that, even inadvertently, fuels polarisation. Polarisation undermines trust in public institutions such as the media and the courts,” she said.“The lower the level of public trust in these institutions, the easier it becomes to capture them. Strive to strengthen institutions by strengthening public trust in them. In turn, ensure these democratic institutions are deserving of this public trust by performing their duties fairly and effectively. Hold them to account.”While most of the lessons from Europe come from formerly communist countries in central and eastern Europe, Italian democrats also have relevant experience. Eighty years after the second world war, a party with fascist roots came to power in elections in 2022. Its prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, a Trump favourite, is in the process ofconsolidating power through constitutional reform.Nathalie Tocci, the director of the Istituto Affari Internazionali, saidItaly’s liberal democrats were “not doing fantastically well” so far at defending democratic norms, but had some basic lessons to pass on to Americans.“The short answer is institutions, institutions, institutions (and the separation of powers between them),” Tocci said. “So far it’s what has contained the damage inItaly.”Igor Bandović, the director of the Belgrade Centre for Security Policy, said Trump’s early move to sack 18 government watchdogs, suggested he is fast-tracking the illiberal playbook all too familiar in Serbia.“It’s a pattern I’ve seen before – one that starts with the quiet dismantling of oversight and ends with institutions that serve only those in power,” Bandović said. “The US still has strong institutions and vocal opposition, but watching these watchdogs be dismissed makes me wonder: is this how it starts?”Slovakiahas seen just how quickly democratic norms can corrode. The current prime minister, Robert Fico, came to power in 2023. His party, Smer, won just 23% of the vote but he was able to put together a coalition with which he has reshaped the country in less than two years.View image in fullscreenPeople take part in a demonstration against the Slovak prime minister, Robert Fico, and his government in Bratislava, Slovakia, on 24 January.Photograph: Jakub Gavlák/EPAHe has shut down the special prosecutor’s office which had been established to fight corruption,steadily extended political control over state and privately owned media, purged cultural institutions and put loyalists in charge, whilecourting Vladimir Putin as a political ally.“We can see now inSlovakiahow important the institutions are – and not only institutions like courts or police but also cultural institutions on the periphery,” Monika Kompaníková, an author and editor, said. She argued the defence of democratic norms consisted of many small battles, fought daily.“People have to be aware that every single step over the line that we tolerate pushes that line,” Kompaníková said, reminding Americans that language matters, as one of the fronts on which democracy is won or lost.“For example, if we tolerate members of the government who are verbally abusive towards women, abusive language will be standardised and later even the law could be changed for the benefits of the abusers.”Polandwent through eight years of democratic backsliding under the rightwing populist Law and Justice party, which diluted the judiciary and turned the state broadcasting network into a party propaganda mouthpiece. But despite the party’s monopoly of state media messaging, it was eventually ousted in 2023 when there was record turnout at parliamentary elections, especially among young Poles. Poland is an example ofhow the anti-democratic tide can be turned.Paulina Milewska at the Helsinki Foundation for Human Rights inPoland, argues one of the reasons democracy was able to fight back was the resilience of privately owned media, about 70% of which remained independent throughout the period of illiberalism.“What was helpful for some media was they started their own foundations so they didn’t have to either shut down or sell themselves. They started getting big donations from wealthy individuals,” Milewska said.She added that some media startups which began in reaction to the Law and Justice party taking power, funded themselves almost wholly from reader subscriptions, and by being fresh on the media scene, managed to sidestep the general lack of trust in more established titles, especially among younger readers.View image in fullscreenPeople take part in the March of Belarusians in Warsaw, Poland, on 26 January, in protest against the presidential election in Belarus.Photograph: Aleksander Kalka/NurPhoto/Rex/ShutterstockFurthermore, independent Polish organisations raised money for legal defence funds to counter lawfare tactics by the ruling party and its supporters, who sought to drown critical media in lawsuits. Milewska said the survival of independent news outlets helped create conditions for the record turnout in the 2023 election which ended Poland’s illiberal era, a possible lesson for the US.“There were some 30 different campaigns before the election that said: voting is cool, voting is sexy, voting is something you want to do,” Milewska said. “The fact that there were still independent media where you could launch this campaign … was certainly gamechanging.”The common message from Europe’s pro-democracy activists was to keep fighting.Pavel Slunkin, a former diplomat fromBelarus, said: “The worst thing that Americans could do now is to stay out of politics.”Belarus only enjoyed a brief experiment in democracy before Alexander Lukashenko took presidential office in 1994 and shut the door behind him. This week, Lukashenko entered his seventh straight term in office, after an election widely denounced as a sham.Slunkin, who resigned as a diplomat in 2020 to protest against the death of democracy in his country, said Americans should avoid the complacency of assuming they can sit out the next four years and then the electoral pendulum would swing back.The lesson of Belarus he argued, was that democratic institutions can be subverted quickly once loyalty replaces merit as the main qualification for a civil service job, a trend that is already well under way in Washington.“This is how it all starts, and in four years, the whole country may look very different,” Slunkin said. “Authoritarianism is not something that happens overnight. It is the process of crossing one red line after another over time, without meeting resistance.”There is a stark contrast now, Slunkin said, with his first stint as a diplomat in the US, some two decades ago. Slunkin was struck then by Americans’ self-confidence.“They didn’t need advice from anyone. They knew right from wrong, and how powerful they were,” he said. “Now when I share the stories of my people and my country, they listen to me.”View image in fullscreenDemonstrators attend an anti-government protest in Bratislava, Slovakia, on 24 January.Photograph: Radovan Stoklasa/ReutersExplore more on these topicsEuropeTrump administrationSerbiaHungaryItalySlovakiaBelarusfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Ferry companies said they would also put on extra services as the uptake for passenger tickets on boats soared.More than 200 undersea tremors shook the island over the weekend – most in waters between Santorini and Amorgos, the Cyclades’ easternmost isle – with scores of fresh overnight earthquakes prompting people to sleep outside or in their cars.“I cried all night because I was very afraid and didn’t know what to do,” a Mexican tourist on a two-day visit to Santorini was quoted as telling the Greek daily Protothema. “We felt that the ground wasn’t at all stable … We were all saying we should stay calm but how can you be calm when the ground is shaking again and again?”View image in fullscreenMotorists and travellers wait on the quayside for the arrival of the ferry at the port on Santorini, 3 February 2025.Photograph: Aris Messinis/AFP/Getty ImagesOn Monday, an earthquake measuring 4.8 on the Richter scale, the most powerful yet, was registered at 2.17 PM local time. Land and rockslides were also recorded.“All scenarios are open,” Dr Gerassimos Papadopoulos, a prominent seismologist, wrote in an online post. “The number of tremors has increased, magnitudes have risen, and epicentres have shifted north-east … The risk level has escalated.”Later in the day, as speculation of a volcanic eruption also grew, he emphasised that the earthquakes were “tectonic, not volcanic”.By order of Greece’s civil protection ministry, schools in Santorini and the surrounding islands of Ios, Anafi and Amorgos are to remain shut until Friday, while people were advised as a precautionary measure to avoid derelict buildings and gathering in large numbers in enclosed spaces.Warnings were also issued to avoid the shoreline and certain ports in case a quake triggered a tsunami. “It appears a seismic fault line has been activated and could cause an earthquake above six [on the Richter scale],” another seismologist, Prof Manolis Skordylis, said on public radio. “We haven’t had the main earthquake yet.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Officials have not ruled out the army being sent in. In the event of a tsunami inhabitants have been told to head to elevated areas inland, where rescue workers have established a staging area, pitching tents in a basketball court close to the island’s main hospital.“We are dealing with a very intense geological phenomenon,” the Greek prime minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, told reporters in Brussels where he was attending an informal EU leaders’ meeting. “I ask that islanders remain calm and listen to the guidance of the civil protection ministry.”Greece sits on multiple fault lines and is often rattled by earthquakes. Research has shown the crust under the seas around Santorini to be a highly active seismic zone.Memories are still vivid of the powerful 7.7 magnitude earthquake that hit Amorgos and Santorini in 1956, triggering a tsunami that resulted in the deaths of 53 people, mass injuries and unprecedented damage.In the intervening years the crescent-shaped island of white chalk houses has become one of Europe’s top destinations, attracting an estimated 3.5 million tourists last year.Explore more on these topicsGreeceEarthquakesEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

He has maintained that he sought her permission for the kiss.If convicted, Rubiales –who resigned as the federation presidenta month after the incident – could face two and a half years in prison: one year for sexual assault over the forced kiss, and 18 months for allegedly coercing Hermoso to downplay what happened.Guardian Footballer of the Year Jenni Hermoso: glory, adversity and a cause that still burnsRead moreGiving evidence on the first day of the trial before the national court in San Fernando de Henares, near Madrid, Hermoso said she hadnever consented to being kissed by Rubiales, adding that he had not sought her permission to do so.“I didn’t hear or understand any of it at the time,” the 34-year-old player told the court. “The next thing was that he put his hands over my ears and kissed me on the mouth.”Hermoso told people she kissed people on the lips only “when I decide to”, adding that she had been shocked by Rubiales’s actions.“I felt it was totally out of place and I then realised my boss was kissing me, and this shouldn’t happen in any social or workplace setting,” she said. “I felt disrespected. One of the happiest days of my life was tarnished and I think it’s very important for me to say that I never sought, much less expected, that this would happen. I think personally that it was a lack of respect.”Hermoso, who plays for Tigres in Mexico, said she had been called off the bus to the airport after the match and shown a statement that had been drafted on her behalf by the federation, and which was issued in her name later the same day.“I skimmed it and I didn’t want to know exactly what it said,” she told the court. “I knew that I hadn’t written a word of the statement because nobody had asked me about it. It was a statement from me that I’d apparently written in my own words. It said that Luis Rubiales and I were good friends and that it had all happened in the excitement of the moment and that was all there was to it.”The player said the statement made her feel “that I was participating in something I hadn’t done and in which I didn’t want to participate”. She added: “I’ll say it again: never, at any moment, did I look for any of this to happen.”Hermoso said she had not wanted what had happened to overshadow her team’s victory, and that some of them had joked about the kiss until another player told them it was a serious matter.She also said she had wanted to celebrate the triumph, despite what had happened, and had been drinking in the dressing room and on the bus.“I was acting according to my heart at the time; I was enjoying it and I wanted to enjoy it,” she said. “I’d just become a world champion and it was a moment to enjoy it and to eat and drink and to get drunk like any footballer would when they’ve won the World Cup.”1:38'Tarnished the celebration': Luis Rubiales apologises after kissing Jenni Hermoso – videoThe footballer was asked by a prosecutor whether anyone from the federation had come to check on her on the flight home or to apologise for what had happened.“No one,” she replied. “No one came over to me to see how I was doing … No one asked how I was or what was going through my head. I felt totally unprotected by the federation because this should have been my safe place. I was a footballer from their country and their national team and no one asked what had happened or if I needed anything. No one came to say anything to me.”Hermoso told the court her life had changed forever when she arrived back in Madrid and found herself and her family hounded by the media. She alsoreceived death threats.“Obviously, even today, I say that my life changed at that moment,” she said. “I’d spent years fighting to win titles for my team, like the World Cup, but all that’s happened to me means that I just haven’t been able to enjoy any of it from the moment I set foot back in Madrid. I’m a world champion but it seems that, even to this day, my life has been on stand-by. I honestly haven’t been able to live freely.”Rubiales, who denies the charges, has vowed to clear his name. “I believe in the truth and I will do everything in my power to make sure it prevails,” he said when he stepped down as head of the federation.He said that although his family and those close to him had been made to suffer “the effects of an excessive persecution” and “many lies”, he felt the public knew the truth.Also on trial for their suspected roles in putting pressure on Hermoso are the former head coach of the women’s national team Jorge Vilda, the former Spanish football federation sporting director Albert Luque and the federation’s former marketing chief Rubén Rivera. All three deny the charges against them.The trial, which is scheduled to last three weeks, continues.Explore more on these topicsSpainEuropeWomen's footballnewsShareReuse this content"

The S&P 500 finished down 0.8% and the tech-focused Nasdaq was down 1.2%.The Dow Jones industrial average briefly broke out of the red to trade marginally higher, before closing down 0.3%.Earlier in the day in London, theFTSE100 share index shed 1.4% from last Friday’s record high, before clawing back some of its losses to trade down 1%.Germany’s DAX index fell by 1.5%, while France’s CAC 40 was down by 1.2%. Spain’s IBEX dropped 1.2% and Italy’s FTSE MIB lost 0.7%.Nvidia, the US tech company that suffered a record plunge in its price last week after the emergence of Chinese AI firm DeepSeek, was the biggest faller on the Dow, down more than 5%.Shares in some of the biggest European carmakers slumped. Volkswagen, BMW, Porsche, Volvo Cars, Stellantis and the commercial vehicle maker Daimler Truck fell between about 5% and 6%. The French car parts supplier Valeo slumped by 8%.Trumpannounced 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada, and a 10% tariffs on Chinese goods.In London, shares fell in companies across several industries. Shares in Scottish Mortgage Investment Trust, which has investments in US tech companies, the retailer JD Sports Fashion and the miner Antofagasta fell more than 4%.The pound edged lower against a strengthened US dollar, down 0.6% at $1.23, but rose 0.5% to €1.20 as the euro came under pressure.The Canadian dollar hit a 20-year low against the US dollar before recovering some losses. Doug Ford, the premier of Ontario, Canada’s most populous province, said he would ban US companies from provincial contracts until the tariffs are removed.He added: “US-based businesses will now lose out on tens of billions of dollars in new revenues. They only have President Trump to blame.“We’re going one step further. We’ll be ripping up the province’s contract with [Elon Musk’s] Starlink.

Bitcoin, the world’s biggest cryptocurrency, hit a three-week low of $91,441.89 overnight and stood at $95,730.35, down 6.2%.One of Wall Street’s biggest banks, JPMorgan, expressed concern that the Trump administration was making conditions harder for businesses.The JP Morgan Chase chief economist, Bruce Kasman, said: “This weekend’s actions challenge our underlying view that the Trump administration will strive to limit disruptive policies as it balances its desire to reduce engagement with the world with a commitment to support US businesses.“In short, the risk is that the policy mix is tilting (perhaps unintentionally) into a business-unfriendly stance.”Richard Hunter, the head of markets at the online investment platform Interactive Investor, said: “February seems likely to begin with a Trump tariff tantrum.”Naeem Aslam, the chief investment officer at Zaye Capital Markets, said investors were bracing for heightened uncertainty in global trade and economic stability: “These downturns are driven by investor anxiety about the broader impact of tariffs on the global economy, particularly as European economies are highly intertwined with US trade policies.”Kathleen Brooks, the research director at XTB, said: “This does not mean that the UK economy will avoid impact from the tariffs, but it does mean that the UK economy could be more resilient than elsewhere.”She added: “It’s too early to know exactly what impact tariffs will have on the global economy, but it is fair to say that they have a high potential of triggering inflation, and weighing heavily on global growth, including the US economy.”Explore more on these topicsStock marketsEconomicsGermanyFranceSpainItalyFTSEnewsShareReuse this content"

A year ago Parton confirmed the reboot was in the works,saying: “They’re still working on that. They’re thinking about bringing it back and revamping it.”‘If the apocalypse comes, beep me!’: Buffy the Vampire Slayer at 25Read moreNo other actors from the original series have yet been confirmed to return but the Deadline writer Nellie Andreeva wrote: “Beyond the pilot order, I hear the reboot is starting a writers room soon, a sign that Hulu and the studios have high expectations for the project going to series.”Andreeva also reported that the Buffycreator Joss Whedon would have no involvement in the reboot,three years after he was accused of misconduct on the sets of numerous projects. Whedon has denied all allegations of threats and cruelty made by several actors including the Buffy actor Charisma Carpenter, who played Cordelia.A Buffy reboot would be the third series in the “Buffyverse”, coming almost 30 years after Buffy the Vampire Slayer began in 1997 and finished in 2003, and more than 20 years after the spin-off series Angel ended, having run for five seasons between 1999 and 2004.Gellar has previously been against the idea of a Buffy reboot, saying in 2023: “I am very proud of the show that we created, and [a revival] doesn’t need to be done. We wrapped that up.“I am all for them continuing the story, because there’s the story of female empowerment … [but] the metaphors of Buffy were the horrors of adolescence. I think I look young but I am not an adolescent.”But late last year Gellar revealed that she had changed her mind after seeing other successful reboots, saying: “It’s funny, I always used to say no, because it’s in its bubble and it’s so perfect. But watching Sex and the City and seeing Dexter, and realising there are ways to do it, definitely does get your mind thinking, ‘Well, maybe.’”Deadline reported that negotiations with Gellar for the reboot had begun after these comments became public.Other shows that have confirmed reboots includeMalcolm in the Middleand Scrubs.Explore more on these topicsBuffy the Vampire SlayerTelevisionnewsShareReuse this content"

I find it quite distressing the way that it hasn’t taken root.”Blanchett is preparing to star in a production of The Seagull at theBarbicanin London, and said she had been inspired by co-star Emma Corrin, as well as Back to Black’s Marisa Abela, who she acts opposite in upcoming Steven Soderbergh filmBlack Bag.“Their point of view on a scene will obviously be profoundly different to mine, or someone of my generation,” said Blanchett.“I’m just amazed by, not only their aliveness of their point of view, but also their technical reserves in ways that I couldn’t have even imagined having or possessing when I was their age.”In 2018, Blanchett was one of many who spoke out aboutHarvey Weinstein, with whom she had collaborated on films such as The Talented Mr Ripley, Carol and The Aviator.Asked if the producer had ever been inappropriate towards her, Blanchett replied: “With me, yes.”She added: “I think he really primarily preyed, like most predators, on the vulnerable. I mean I got a bad feeling from him. He would often say to me, ‘We’re not friends.’”Weinstein is currently awaiting retrial in New York after a court overturned his 2020 conviction for the sexual assault and rape of two other women. He was also separately convicted of rape in Los Angeles in 2022 and sentenced to 16 years.Cate Blanchett claims Harvey Weinstein was ‘inappropriate’ with herRead moreHis lawyers have also appealed against this conviction. Weinstein, who is 72 and has beendiagnosed with leukemia, said: “I’m begging the court to move your date so we can have that date instead and proceed with this trial as quickly as we can and get out of this hell hole.”Blanchett was last Oscar nominated two years ago for the film Tár, and most recently won for Woody Allen film Blue Jasmine in 2014.

Daniel Harding’s well-judged account of Mahler 7 caught the symphony’s sense of impending disintegrationMartin KettleMon 3 Feb 2025 11.58 ESTLast modified on Mon 3 Feb 2025 12.10 ESTShareOrdinarily, the main attraction of this London Symphony Orchestra concert underDaniel Hardingwould have been Mahler’s Seventh symphony, a special-occasion piece which is still relatively rarely performed compared with its peers. But this was alsoDaniil Trifonov’s much anticipated first appearance in London since before the pandemic. The buzz among a capacity Barbican audience about the celebrated Russian pianist’s return was palpable.Trifonov did not disappoint. Under his hands, the reading of Robert Schumann’s A minor piano concerto was searchingly individual in the very best sense, with Trifonov illuminating the muscularity of Schumann’s piano writing as well as its delicate poetry. Trifonov unquestionably commands the restraint of dynamics that Schumann’s scoring requires from the soloist – his passagework was exemplary. But he was unafraid of making weightier keyboard statements too, even in the opening bars and especially in the first movement cadenza.View image in fullscreenThis is music that teeters on the edge … Daniel Harding conducts the LSO.Photograph: Mark Allan/PhilharmoniaThere was a similar integration of lyricism and vigour in the later movements. The intermezzo was exquisitely weighted, with well judged accompaniment from Harding and the LSO, before the explosions of the finale. This concerto is sometimes depicted as an outright rejection of the Romantic masculine virtuoso tradition, but Trifonov’s account was more nuanced and three-dimensional than that, looking forward to the concertos of Brahms and beyond.After the interval, Harding delivered a press-on performance of Mahler’sextraordinary and extravagant Seventh. This is music that teeters on the edge, but the opening movement felt generally too fast and too hard-driven to capture the score’s underlying bleakness. The three hallucinatory middle movements were another matter. Full of instrumental innovation and a sense of actual and impending disintegration at every turn, all were well judged by Harding and often brilliantly played by the LSO, among whomEivind Ringstad’s solo viola deserves a special mention for its idiomatically Mahlerian mix of eeriness and sweetness. Then it was back to propulsion, as the finale careered to a conclusion that was suitably jubilant and manic at the same time.Explore more on these topicsClassical musicLondon Symphony OrchestrareviewsShareReuse this content"

When we got to the toilet scene, my father put his head in his hands and said, “No, Jeffrey …”’Interviews by Simon BlandMon 3 Feb 2025 10.48 ESTLast modified on Mon 3 Feb 2025 16.24 ESTShareJeff Daniels, played HarryI was bored with drama and wanted to explore comedy, but my agents didn’t want me to do the film. They said: “There’s a chanceJim Carreywill wipe you off the screen.” I said: “Maybe – but not if I workwithhim.” And that’s what I did. I remember thinking: “It’s either going to be such a bad career move I’ll never work again, or it just might be funny.”One day Jim came into rehearsals having put a bowl on his head and cut his hair, because that’s how his character Lloyd would do it. I thought: “I gotta come up with something.” We were staying at a Holiday Inn and I started using the shampoo but with no conditioner. Then I’d towel my hair dry and not comb it. And that was it. I came in and said: “Maybe this is Harry’s look?” Everyone agreed. After a couple of months, you could almost break my hair off.John Hughes said we could never use his name to sell it. If we did, it was a million-dollar fineThe first morning of shooting had me and Jim up against each other on a little scooter going down mountains. We had helmets on but I had no idea whether Jim could even drive a scooter – and then he started weaving!The scene where I got my tongue stuck to the icy chairlift was bumpy, too. It’s one of the few times where you can see me break into laughter because I just knew it was funny.I was stretching myself comedically. I remember getting ready to shoot the toilet scene, after my character unknowingly drinks laxative-laden tea. Jim asked me: “Hey man, you OK?” I said: “Just cold feet. This is either the beginning of my career or the end of it.” He said: “You’ve gotta go all in man. Go all the way!” He couldn’t have been a better cheerleader. Me on that toilet will be the image on my tombstone.I have a theatre company in Michigan so I put on a preview. I was sat next to my parents and when we got to the toilet scene, my father hung his head in his hands and said: “No, Jeffrey …” Meanwhile 5,000 people fell out of their chairs laughing. The reviews were horrible though. I still have a scrapbook of 200 newspapers panning the movie and wishing it never existed. Then we were the box office No 1 for six straight weeks. That’s when it hit me that we’d done the impossible.Peter and Bobby Farrelly, directorsThe idea came from John Hughes. He was planning a movie called Ski Nuts about two dumb guys in Aspen. That’s all he had. Our agent asked if we wanted to work with him. We pitched the first act of Dumb and Dumber and he literally fell off his chair laughing. “This is it,” he said. “And you’re directing it.”We wrote the script in three weeks but the studio didn’t get back to us. Then John left Universal so the project just sat there for a couple of years until I wrote to John asking if he could ask Universal to give us the rights back. He did but said we could never use his name when selling it. If we did, it was a million-dollar fine. When promoting the movie, we wanted to say it was John Hughes’s idea but we didn’t have a million dollars. Now, though, we finally thought we’d tell. We think he’d be happy for people to know the truth.View image in fullscreen‘Jim pushed to make them even dumber’ … Peter, top, and Bobby Farrelly in 1998.Photograph: Bob Riha Jr/Getty ImagesThe movie wouldn’t have got made without Jim Carrey. Everybody in town shot it down. Then someone called and said: “Jim Carrey wants to do it.” His career was just taking off. He’d made Ace Ventura and The Mask but neither had been released. Ace Ventura was a surprise hit, and to have him attached to our low-budget movie catapulted us into a higher stratosphere.We knew Jeff Daniels had a comedic sensibility but the studio didn’t see it. Jim read with him and said: “That guy scared the shit out of me. I was on my heels the whole time. That’s got to be the guy.” We said: “Great. Tell the studio.” Jim called and said he wanted Jeff.Jim relished the fact that these characters were incorrigibly dumb and pushed to make them even dumber. We showed up at his house before shooting and he had that haircut and his tooth was chipped. We were hysterical. He said it was the haircut he had when he was a kid. He had chipped his tooth as a kid, too. He had been to the dentist and had them chip the tooth cap.In the final scene, a bus-full of girls on a national bikini tour offer Harry and Lloyd jobs as oil boys. The studio absolutely wanted them to get on the bus, but Jeff and Jim both said: “We’re not getting on that bus. Lloyd and Harry are too dumb. These guys are dumb and they remain dumb.” We agreed. It was a risky move. The studio was upset – but the audience loved it.Explore more on these topicsComedy filmsHow we madeJim CarreyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Prepare to say goodbye to a lot of free timeKeith StuartMon 3 Feb 2025 09.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 3 Feb 2025 12.19 ESTShareMany years ago, when Civilization II was on its way, I’d just started as a writer on the video game magazine Edge. As a fan of the original Civilization, a complex turn-based strategy sim about building vast kingdoms through thousands of years of human history, I was keen to review the sequel and my editor let me. Reader, I became completely addicted. I played the game for two weeks non-stop, leaving many pages of the magazine unwritten. This earned me a very severe written warning. In short, Sid Meier’s series almost ended my career in games writing – which is perhaps why I didn’t review the following four instalments. Now it is back, and I can no longer avoid it. I must face my seductive nemesis.In many ways, this is the game that I, and many thousands of other fans, have always known and obsessively loved: a complex, far-reaching and fascinating simulation tracking the rise of empires from ancient tribal groups to modern-day superpowers. As a player, you found towns and cities, gather resources and research new technologies, from literacy to nuclear fission, while sending out settlers, merchants and armies to expand your reach and either placate or destroy other nations. Victory can come from military might, cultural cachet or economic domination, depending on how you play and what you’re interested in. No two campaigns are ever the same.View image in fullscreenExtra nuance … Civilization VII.Photograph: 2K GamesFor this new instalment, coming almost a decade after its predecessor, Firaxis has made some radical alterations. The biggest by far is that you no longer guide a single civilisation throughout the entire campaign. Instead, you select a leader with attributes you admire – the sneaky Machiavelli, perhaps, or how about the wise Confucius – then guide that figure through a series of three distinct historical ages picking a different nation for each section. Each nation has its own unique units and buildings, adding extra nuance to your game. In my first playthrough I started the Antiquity Age with Greece because I really fancied building the Acropolis. Then I flipped to the flighty Normans for the Exploration Age, then finished as the US for the Modern Age. You don’t loseeverythingin this switching process – all your discoveries and progress points from the previous age remain, and you can opt to keep all your towns. You’re also able to select specific legacies of your past to bring forward.This gives the game a very definite structure, combatting the malaise that can often occur hours into a Civ campaign when you realise you don’t stand a chance against some brutally powerful neighbour who’s somehow developed an army five times the size of yours. If you’re struggling during one age, you just need to hold out until the next one arrives, giving you the chance to reset your objectives and relationships with nearby nations. It also ensures a technological makeover for all your units, so you can’t enter the modern era with a civilisation that can build nuclear power stations but still fights with spears and gets about the place on horseback. In a sense, it’s like your leader is on a journey through successive domains – which makes it feel more like an adventure than a straightforward sim.View image in fullscreenMore approachable … Civilization VII.Photograph: 2K GamesThere are other changes to make the game more approachable for modern players. Leaders attain attribute points based on achievements in six categories such as culture, science and combat, which can be spent on related skill trees – just like a role-playing game. There are also legacy targets that act as quests, such as building a certain number of Wonders of the World or making key scientific discoveries, moving you towards an outright victory.Beneath all this, lots of systems have been tweaked and re-thought. Maintaining diplomatic relations with other nations is a multifaceted dance involving the use of a new currency – influence – to organise shared cultural events and economic pacts, or when things go badly, many different types of subterfuge and sabotage. Throughout the years, narrative events crop up like Chance cards in a game of Monopoly, providing moments of humorous challenge. How do you react when a famous poet writes a highly critical epic about you? What do you do when a mysterious stranger demands that you copy and pass on a dusty old scroll to at least three other civilisations or face a terrible curse?Does it still resemble a sort of digitised board game? No. The landscapes may be divided into hexagonal tiles in the traditions of table-top wargaming, but they are now crammed with colour and authentic detail, from craggy mountains to swirling seas, to lively cities crowded with ornate buildings reflecting both the time period and the civilisation they belong to. Battles play out as animated tussles between intricate miniaturised troops and thundering armoured vehicles. Occasional natural disasters send floods, tornadoes and fires across the map with devastating drama.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toPushing ButtonsFree weekly newsletterKeza MacDonald's weekly look at the world of gamingEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

You get the nations that hide in a corner and quietly invent space travel before you’ve got a reliable train service, and then there are the warmongers – and I’m looking at you Gilbert du Motier – who start little fights to probe your defences then turn vicious and unrelenting, surrounding your cities and crushing isolated units. Alternatively, there’s always the cross-platform multiplayer mode if you want to pit yourself against human competitors; I wasn’t able to test this on public servers before release, but it has performed well in previews.So here we are, more than 30 years after the original game, still hungry to rule the world – and devouring every morsel of maniacal power. Some veterans may balk at the structural changes: Civilization VII is very much the Civilization for now – deep and complex, but with an emphasis on human drama and achievement rather than the sweep of faceless units across a mathematical matrix. There are still few moments in video games as pleasing as building the Hanging Gardens, or discovering a bountiful new location for a town, or marching a phalanx of troops into a battered enemy capital. This game, which once almost cost me my job, will gracefully sneak away with hours, days and possibly months of your life. But then, nobody ever conquered the world in an afternoon.Civilization VII is launched on PC (version tested), PS4/5, Switch,Xbox Oneand Xbox Series S/X, 11 FebruaryExplore more on these topicsGamesPCXbox series S/XNintendo SwitchPlayStation 4PlayStation 5Xbox OnereviewsShareReuse this content"

Even Beyoncé.” And so it came to pass for Drake, seeingKendrick Lamarwin for Not Like Us, walking to the podium in double denim – a “Canadian tuxedo”, no less – while half the arena seemed to chant “tryna strike a chord and it’s probably a minor”, a line alleging child sexual abuse (which Drake has strenuously denied). Drake has long framed the Grammys as somewhere that doesn’t understand rap music and he had already distanced himself from the awards – and perhaps that turned Recording Academy voters against him all the more. But these were deserved wins for Lamar – the beef allowed him to turn his lens away from himself, and in so doing made a very 21st-century entertainment: gossipy, networked, and packed with reference. Meanwhile, having seen the entire industry united in celebration against him makes you wonder anew: where next for Drake?View image in fullscreenNot clowning around … Chappell Roan performs at the Grammys.Photograph: Maya Dehlin Spach/FilmMagicChappell Roan called for workers’ rights …For all her playfulness on stage and on record, there’s also a seriousness of intent to Chappell Roan: part of the reason she’s so loved is that she totally devotes herself to her craft, selling every line she sings. That’s played out in her earnest politics, too, whether upbraiding a hectoring paparazzo, fretting about who to back (if anyone) in the US presidential race, and championing the rights of queer people and Palestinians. At the Grammys, she used the platform of a best new artist win to advocate for workers’ rights, namely her fellow musicians, with a “demand that labels in the industry profiting millions of dollars off of artists offer a livable wage and healthcare, especially to developing artists.” She spoke of struggling to afford health insurance in her early career, saying: “It was so devastating to feel so committed to my art and feel so betrayed by the system and so dehumanised to not have health[care]. If my label would have prioritised artists’ health, I could have been provided care by a company I was giving everything to … Labels, we got you, but do you got us?”… and Lady Gaga for trans rightsAs Donald Trumpenshrines transphobiain American law, Lady Gaga spoke out, saying: “Trans people are not invisible.

The queer community deserves to be lifted up.” She was speaking after winning best pop duo/group performance for Die With a Smile, with Bruno Mars.Doechii capped her breakthrough year …Twenty-six-year-old rapper Doechii beat some of the most venerable, successful and respected MCs in the US – Eminem, Future, J Cole and the paired-up Common and Pete Rock – to win best rap album, only the third woman to win this category after Lauryn Hill and Cardi B. This caps a stunning breakthrough over the past year, with jaws floored by the emphatically enunciated, elastically rhythmic raps on her album Alligator Bites Don’t Heal, and then again by performances such as on Stephen Colbert’s talkshow, her braided hair fused to that of her dancers. Her performance on the Grammys’ stage was even stronger, a brilliantly choreographed strut through Denial Is a River where – with some expert help from her DJ, Miss Milan – she kept her flow going through high kicks, trust falls and a suit-busting bikini reveal.The 2025 Grammys celebrated pop being back to its agenda-setting bestRead more… as did Sierra FerrellWith her fourth album, Ferrell made a clean sweep of the roots and Americana categories, winning all four of the awards she was nominated for (in a less brutally competitive year, she would have got a best new artist nomination too). Dressed in one of the night’s wackier outfits – think East End pearly queen after five rounds of AI enhancement, complete with sceptre – she’s travelled a long way from the trailer-dwelling and freight train-hopping of her youth, to become a multimillion-streaming performer. As country and pop do-si-do ever more tightly, Ferrell, Zach Bryan and more are winning millions of fans drawn to a more authentic and analogue-sounding version of this vintage American music.Beyoncé finally won album of the yearShe may have been the most-awarded star in history, but given the industry places such stock in the album format,Beyoncénot winning that category felt like a big snub – particularly given her self-titled album lost to Beck’s Morning Phase (not remotely the best album that year or in his own catalogue), while her great masterpiece 4 wasn’t even nominated. So that wrong has now been righted. Some may be dismayed that it took a country album to do it, rather than an R&B, pop or dance record – and Cowboy Carter has plenty of longueurs and even outright missteps. But it also contains some of Beyoncé’s most imaginative and beautiful music – the way Riverdance flows into II Hands II Heaven makes it the loveliest brace of songs on an album in her catalogue. Its bigger win in some ways is best country album, showing that Beyoncé has convinced not just the broad pool of voters in the general field categories, but also the Nashville establishment who vote for the country awards.An American won best global music albumMatt B, a little-streamed musician born and raised in Illinois and based in the US, beat representatives from Spain (Antonio Rey), Peru (Ciro Hurtado), and Nigeria (superstars Tems and Rema) to win best global music album for Alkebulan II, recorded with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra. His album certainly creates a global dialogue, as he explores his African heritage with multilingual lyrics, lilting Afro-pop, and guests such as South African poet Nomfundo Khambule. But as the US enters its protectionist era under Trump, there may be some disquiet at this win.Grammy awards 2025: Taylor Swift, Charli xcx, Chappell Roan and more – in picturesRead moreA multimillionare businesswoman won best new age albumIt’s a shame that the great Ryuichi Sakamoto, the Japanese musician who died of cancer aged 71 in 2023 having changed the face of his country’s popular music, wasn’t honoured in the category for best new age, ambient or chant album. His nominated LP Opus was full of his very particular piano style, full of chords that feel cautious and yet intentional, and where sentimentality is offset by chalky, dissonant notes. Instead, he lost to the little-heard Triveni by Wouter Kellerman, Eru Matsumoto and Chandrika Tandon, the latter a businesswoman and philanthropist (and sister of former Pepsi CEO Indra Nooyi) who worked for McKinsey before starting her own financial services firm.The Academy still loves Chris StapletonHe lost to Beyoncé in the country album category, but Stapleton notched up his fifth win in 10 years in the best country solo performance category, a mark of how much the country-voting portion of the Recording Academy adores this artist, who pleases both staunch traditionalists while being relatively progressive – that’s 11 wins overall for him now. It’s a shame, though, that he won with a low-stakes ballad from the same album as his win last year, while shutting out Shaboozey’s pop culturally dominant A Bar Song (Tipsy) in the process.Chris Brown was awardedWay after his notorious assault on Rihanna, Chris Brown has been accused of a long list of crimes against numerous women over the years, which he has denied –last weekhe sued over how he was represented in a new documentary, with lawyers saying: “Mr Brown has never been found guilty of any sex related crime … but this documentary states in every available fashion that he is a serial rapist and sexual abuser.” His win for best R&B album, over a big breakthrough by Muni Long and another veteran in Usher, plus others, shows that he still has his backers in the Recording Academy. But there has been disquiet online – just as there has for Kanye West’s red carpet appearance with his wife, Bianca Censori essentially appearing nude, the latest in a series of mute, near-undressed appearances alongside him that have provoked widespread concern for her welfare.View image in fullscreenBrit brat … Charli xcx.Photograph: Amy Sussman/Getty ImagesFemale artists did well – but men still dominate behind the scenesTwo of the “big four” were won by female artists, but when you look into the actual winners, they were overwhelmingly male. These awards are shared by the producers, songwriters, engineers, mixers and mastering engineers and while there is some heartening female representation – such as Idania Valencia who mastered Charli xcx’s Brat, and songwriters such as Elizabeth Lowell Boland and songwriter of the year winner Amy Allen – analysis byAkasfound that only 9% of winners in the top four categories were women.And it was a bad night for the BritsCharli xcx was the chief British representative, and she gave an instantly viral bum-wiggling, underwear-chucking live performance of Guess on the night, but she was shut out of the big prizes, making do with dance-pop awards. And it wasn’t a great night for other Brits. Belfast’s Jordan Adetunji was beaten to the melodic rap prize by Rapsody and Erykah Badu, Raye lost out twice, while Jacob Collier’s seventh win was a minor award, for arrangement. Instead we had to rely on the Beatles and the Rolling Stones for some face-saving wins, for best rock performance and album respectively (while Sean Ono Lennon also picked up an award, for co-creating the box set release of his father’s album Mind Games).This article was updated on 3 February with a correction: Beyonce’s self-titled album, not Lemonade, lost to Beck’s Morning Phase.Explore more on these topicsGrammysAwards and prizesKendrick LamarChappell RoanBeyoncéLady GagaCharli xcxfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Sexy mathsThe answers to today’s prime teasersAlex BellosMon 3 Feb 2025 12.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 3 Feb 2025 16.20 ESTShareEarlier today I set two puzzles involving prime numbers – in particular 3, 7 and 11. Primes are on this month’s cultural radar thanks to the Apple TV+ thriller Prime Target, which stars hunkdu jourLeo Woodall (above.)Here they are again with solutions.1. Prime powerWithout using a calculator, what is the last digit of 3 to the power of a million, i.e 31,000,000?Solution: 1When you multiply 3 by itself, the final digit of the answer cycles through the digits 3, 9, 7 and 1. Since a million is divisible by four, the final digit of 3 to the million is 1.2. The 7-ElevenA shopper walks into a convenience store and buys four items. The cashier says the total is £7.11.‘How funny,’ says the shopper. ‘That’s the name of the shop.’‘What’s also funny is that I multiplied the prices of the four items together,’ says the cashier.‘Aren’t you supposed to add the items together?’ replies the shopper.‘You can do if you like – the total is exactly the same.’What are the prices of the items?Solution £3.16, £1.25, £1.20 and £1.50Let the prices bea, b, candd. Then we know[1]a + b + c + d= 7.11[2]a x b x c x d = abcd =7.11We can assume that the prices in the shop are in pounds and pence, so lets multiply each of them by 100 to get rid of the decimal point.[3]100a + 100b + 100c + 100d= 711[4] 100a x100b x100c x100d = 100,000,000abcd =711,000,000To keep things neat, let A = 100a, B = 100b,etc, so we can rephrase the above.[3]A + B + C + D= 711[4] ABCD =711,000,000We need to solve these two equations, and we do this by first finding the prime factors of 711 million. (In the postwhere I set the puzzle I explained that all numbers can be broken down into their constituent prime numbers.)The prime factorisation of 711 million is 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 3 x 3 x 5 x 5 x 5 x 5 x 5 x 5 x 79. ( I said you were allowed touse this siteto find prime factors)Now we work out which of these prime factors make up A, B, C and D.You do this through trial and error, which can be time consuming so at noon I gave the hint that £3.16 was a solution. This corresponds to 316 (since we multiplied the prices by 100). The prime factors of 316 are 79 x 2 x 2. So lets say A = 79 x 2 x 2.The hint also said that the other three prices divide by 5p. Thus we know that 5 is a factor of B, and D. We also know from [3] that B + C + D = 395.By playing around with the prime numbers in our factorisation, we get B = 5 x 5 x 5 = 125, C = 5 x 3 x 2 x 2 = 120, and D = 5 x 5 x 3 x 2 = 150. Thus the prices are £1.25, £1.20 and £1.50. Check them if you dont believe me! They add up and multiply to £7.11.What’s great about this puzzle not so much the solving of it, but the fact that it is amusing to find such an arithmetical gem in a global brand.I hope you enjoyed the puzzles, I’ll be back in two weeks.Thanks to Steve Thompson who suggested the first puzzle, and to the PR team at Apple TV+.I’ve been setting a puzzle here on alternate Mondays since 2015.

It looks and sounds like one of the four most famous fashion weeks: London, Paris, New York or Milan.But this is a cloudy February night in Berlin. The brand, GmbH, showed its designs in Paris this time last year, but it has come back to Berlin for a second season, the headline act for a home crowd.While the big four fashion weeks remain the undisputed champions, a host of other European cities are vying for a spot on the industry’s calendar. Foremost among them is the Danish capital, Copenhagen, which kicked off its own event late last month, after the menswear and couture shows in Milan and Paris.What began as the merging of two small Danish trade fairs in 2006 is now regularly referred to as the “fifth fashion week”, due to its influence in the industry and beyond. It attracts buyers from leading global luxury chains, fashion directors from global publications such as Vogue and a string of influencers.View image in fullscreenA look from Henrik Vibskov’s autumn/winter 2025 show at Copenhagen fashion week.Photograph: James CochraneBerlin fashion week, which finishes on Monday, might not be there yet, but it’s growing. Fashion CouncilGermany(FCG) took the reins in 2023 and, in the words of CEO Scott Lipinski “decided to reset”, successfully rebranding from its earlier incarnation as the more corporate Mercedes-Benz fashion week. Venues such as churches, train depots and the hallowed halls of world-famous nightclub Berghain have all been commandeered for shows.GmbH’s return to Berlin was, according to one of its two designers, Benjamin Huseby, for “pragmatic reasons” – the FCG offered support and a grant to put on a show in the city. But it was also a welcome chance, as a Berlin-brand, to “connect with our community”.Alberto Calabrese is a contributing writer for Vogue Italia who has travelled to fashion weeks in Prague, Helsinki, Kyiv, Lisbon, Porto and Budapest. There is, he thinks, a logic: “Showcasing in a place that is intimately linked with your culture, heritage and upbringing is crucial to let these creatives present something that feels really authentic.”Another Berlin-based brand, Richert Beil, is a case in point. It’s founder, Michele Beil, said: “You can see the roots in our collection.” Their leather and latex clothes fall squarely within the city’s aesthetic; the political message felt apt, too.For the headliners, these alternative fashion weeks offer a chance to be bigger fish in a smaller pond. In Paris, said Huseby: “You’re up against all these huge conglomerates, fighting for attention in a very packed schedule.” According to Beil: “Berlin fashion week is kind of defining itself at the moment. [It’s] super nice to be here … it opens new doors to be creative and stand for something.”View image in fullscreenThe brand Haderlump took over a railway depot for a collection inspired by the fashion of rail passengers in the mid-20th century.Photograph: Andreas Rentz/Getty ImagesUnlike many of the globally famous brands that dominate the big four and are often owned by large conglomerates, some of the smaller, independent designers at alternative weeks can use their platforms to speak without boardroom constraints. In Copenhagen, Alectra Rothschild, founder of Masculina, used hers to highlight anti-trans violence. Rothschild, who is a trans woman, opened the show with a recording of Donald Trumpdeclaring an executive orderallowing “only two genders, male and female, in the US”.The GmbH show took place hours after aprotest against the rise of the far-right, anti-immigrant Alternative für Deutschland partyhad taken place in the city. While not explicitly political in the way of some of the brand’s past shows, it was, according to the designers backstage, “a collection of mourning” in troubled times. Jumpers read “Refuse to trade with the enemy” and models carried prayer beads. Earlier in the day,Melisa Minca gave guests a revolutionary pamphletat its part-rally, part-party, part-fashion show. At the Lueder show, a “Men are so back” vest got a guffaw from the usually poker-faced front row.Some of these smaller fashion weeks also place sustainability at the heart of what they do in a way the big four do not. Since 2023, Copenhagen has insisted that 60% of collections must be made from certified materials or deadstock fabrics; banned fur and feathers; and required proof that supply chains provide fair and safe working conditions. Cecilie Thorsmark, the CEO of Copenhagen fashion week, used this year’s opening ceremony to highlight the US’s withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement, saying: “Change is not optional. It’s essential.”Thora Valdimarsdottir, co-founder of Rotate, one of Denmark’s hottest labels, says Copenhagen’s focus on “sustainability, innovation and inclusivity … really sets them apart”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFashion StatementFree weekly newsletterStyle, with substance: what's really trending this week, a roundup of the best fashion journalism and your wardrobe dilemmas solvedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But already several brands, such as Palm Wine Ice Cream and PLNGNS, create with sustainable practices in mind.View image in fullscreenLueder’s ‘Men are so back’ vest raised an intentional laugh at Berlin fashion week.Photograph: Matthias Nareyek/Getty ImagesThere are benefits at a city level, too. According to Lipinski: “We can see the impact in Berlin with the rise of new brands … It’s a barometer indicating that Berlin and the fashion week are gaining more economic value.” In social terms, it can also be a boon. Speaking at the opening dinner and referencing the current political climate, Franziska Giffey, Berlin state senator for economy, energy and enterprise said that for her, the week is a marker “of a tolerant society”.Of course these alternative fashion weeks are not always going to win over the big four. Last year, Copenhagen lost one of its star brands when Ganni decided to show in Paris. It followed Cecilie Bahnsen, which decamped to the French capital in 2022. Both are a loss to Denmark, but homegrown brands making it in Paris or Milan proves Copenhagen’s success in nurturing designers. Ditte Reffstrup, creative director at Ganni, said the brand “wouldn’t be what we are today without Copenhagen fashion week”.View image in fullscreenThe Palm Wine Ice Cream brand held its Berlin show in the celebrated nightclub, Berghain.Photograph: Sebastian Reuter/Getty ImagesWhile Huseby doesn’t discount showing in Paris again, he believes the most important thing for the likes of Copenhagen and Berlin is that they don’t try to emulate the other fashion weeks. “These cities have a unique character and a long history,” he said. “You have to harness what’s really unique about that place.”Explore more on these topicsFashionGermanyDenmarkFashion weeksEuropefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Reviving a childhood passion helped me reconnect with my bodyEloise SkinnerMon 3 Feb 2025 05.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 3 Feb 2025 09.26 ESTShareMy earliest memories of ballet will be familiar to many childhood dancers: ribbons, shoe fittings, hairspray (lots of it). I attended my first class at about four years old and continued off and on until my early teens, when I started to focus on other activities and on studying for exams. Since I was never planning to become a professional dancer, I didn’t consider that ballet would become an important part ofmy adult life. But today, at 32, it is one of my most meaningful passions – and I am so grateful to have rediscovered it.That happened in my early 20s, when I was a corporate lawyer in London. The job involved a lot of late nights and desk work. I was looking for a fitness class that would get me out of my head and back into my body and I stumbled across a beginner ballet class. There, I was amazed to find that I remembered some of the patterns – the position of the spine, the arm movements (port de bras) – and the French terminology. But what struck me most was how good it felt to move with a group of dancers, to adopt the discipline of the ballet technique and see myself improve – if only by a small amount – by the end of the class.Equipped with my renewed love of ballet, I quickly discovered the huge variety of adult classes on offer. Professional dance schools such as Central School ofBalletoffer adult classes (for “fun, fitness and wellbeing”) and there is a wide range available for all levels at private dance studios. Throwing myself into ballet provided me with a way to de-stress from work, reconnect with my body and centre myself in the moment (try worrying about your emails when you are focusing on a perfecttenduorplié).I quickly filled up my schedule, taking private lessons and courses and moving into pointe classes – revisiting those shoe fittings after a break of almost 10 years.I have always had a love of fitness and movement – I am now a yoga and pilates instructor, even teaching at the studio where I took that first adult ballet class – but ballet offers something different. Many commentators have wrangled overwhether ballet is a sport or an art, but it can encompass both: creativity and athleticism; expression and physical technique. Ballet has a unique ability to make you feel like a seamless part of a groupanda solo performer; to feel light and effortless one moment and to feel the intense pain of pointe work the next.More than any other fitness activity, ballet brings me back to the present – something I appreciate now in a way that my childhood self may have missed.Explore more on these topicsBalletThe one change that workedDanceMindfulnessFitnessHealth & wellbeingHobbiesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Paying his rent in their flatshare was an obvious move after he told her he was about to lose his job.But what started as a helping hand was quickly met with controlling behaviour when he started to criticise what she ate and her hygiene. Soon she felt confined to her room due to his belittling jibes, and was left on the brink of suicide.After years of abuse, he eventually departed, leaving the vulnerable woman exploited and more than £30,000 out of pocket.“I acted under duress – I was put under enormous pressure and my mental ill-health was exploited. I have lost enormous amounts of money,” she says.“I feel as if he exploited my vulnerability due to my mental health, by making me believe he was going to rot away on the street, and decided to take my money, and call me abusive.”Davis now realises, after help from friends and charities, that she was the victim of “mate crime” – loosely defined as exploitation, abuse or theft involving someone who claims to be a friend.Often associated with the elderly, or those with learning difficulties, it can happen to anyone, say experts, and has become easier in recent years with the development of online friendships and relationships.Davis says there was no sign of what would transpire when she first offered her friend – whom she had known for a few years – a home when he said he was at risk of homelessness. But it soon became clear that he was not going to lose his job – merely that he did not like it.“He thought living in the flatshare on my money would be more convenient. I got annoyed that my offer to help was based on a misrepresentation of his situation,” she says.“He told me I’d made a binding promise to support him, and started guilt-tripping me – since he would be homeless and could not return to his job – and also made clear he thought I didn’t give him enough money.”His behaviour varied between friendly and “intense” fairly soon after he moved in. He became controlling, calling her unhygienic, blaming her if anything broke and criticising her political opinions. He regularly turned off the heating, leaving her in the cold.Despite this, she tried to be engaging and friendly, believing that she was helping someone in need, but his behaviour worsened.“At some point I avoided any conversations so as not to be put down,” she says.Davis’s mental health before he moved in was poor, and she found confrontation difficult. She also suffers from a neurological condition and had a history of depression.As his behaviour worsened, she became increasingly unwell. “Every time I tried to stop paying him, he would start getting intense. He would sometimes be ‘accepting’ of me, but then double down on the abuse.”As well as paying his rent, she gave him money to live on. When she tried to stop, he said she would be making him homeless. “Whenever I tried to call him out on his behaviour, he would turn it around and call me abusive, mean and a liar.”‘The things people are ready to put up with to have “a friend” in their life are pretty extreme’Rod Landman, ARC EnglandWhat Davis went through is a frustratingly familiar story to Rod Landman, an expert in this area at ARC England, a charity which deals with learning disabilities and autism.“Mate crime”, a loose term for this type of exploitation, typically happens to people who are vulnerable in some way, he says, and victims are often older people and those with learning disabilities and autism. But it is not restricted to those groups.Many victims suffer from loneliness and isolation, he says, and want the validation that friendships with other people can bring.“The prospect of life without friendship is a pretty bleak one, and the sorts of things people are prepared to put up with in order to have someone in their life that they regard as being a friend are pretty extreme,” he says.In 2006,38-year-old Steven Hoskin diedin Cornwall after he was forced to fall from a 100ft railway viaduct by a couple who had moved into his flat and tortured and humiliated him.More everyday examples could be people turning up on the day that benefits are paid to “help” recipients to the ATM, or to spend their money.Everyday mate crime is hugely under-reported, says Landman, and there are now more opportunities for people to become victims as a result of social networking.Signs that there may be a problem include when someone might have less money than they should be expected to have, or does not have enough money to eat, says Ali Gunn of United Response, a social care charity. The Crown Prosecution Service puts it within the terms of hate crime, where people are targeted for their race, religion, nationality or other protected characteristics.Davis finally found some relief when a counsellor told her that she was in an emotionally and financially abusive relationship. Then she told a friend who had noticed how stressed she was at home.“There were moments where I deluded myself into thinking that I am such a good person for ‘helping people’. Then I had moments where I did not dare to leave my room because I was concerned about him harassing me.“I saw no way for me to exit the situation and say ‘no’ to any of his requests, since these would be met with him getting intense and emotionally abusive in the house, and I was acutely suicidal.”A charity told her she needed to throw him out, and she gathered the courage to do so last year, but she is now more than £30,000 out of pocket because of her contributions to him.“With my flatmate now, the cleaning complaints also seem to have magically vanished,” she says. “If I had not sought help, I would still be in this situation.”*Name has been changed.

Simply chuck everything in there, turn it on and a few hours later dinner is effortlessly served. No fuss, just delicious meals.But there are a few basic slow cooker rules that you need to abide by. First, the liquid: unlike the oven or hob, a slow cooker doesn’t lose as much liquid through evaporation, so even if a dish looks as if it’s not saucy enough, trust me, it very probably is, in which case adding a load of extra stock or water will just leave you with soup, which is ideal only if you’re actually making soup. You just have to learn to trust the process.Meat with a higher fat content (think brisket, chicken thighs, pork shoulder) truly thrives with a long, slow cook, and becomes melt-in-the-mouth tender. Leaner meat, on the other hand, runs the risk of drying out, if you’re not careful, so snap up those cheaper, fattier cuts and save yourself some pennies while you’re about it.If, like me, your schedule is a bit all over the shop, you need freezer dump bags in your life. Don’t let the name put you off: prep ingredients way in advance, put them in airtight bags/containers, and freeze. Defrost overnight, then dump into the slow cooker in the morning. Easy! They’re especially good for soups, stews and sauces, and for those who don’t want to be chopping meat and veg before heading out to work.Slow cookers aren’t just for stews and soups, either. I use mine for dauphinoise potatoes, and for taco and sandwich fillings – buffalo chicken with coleslaw slapped in a brioche roll is always a winning lunch (add cream cheese to any leftovers for a moreish dip). Also, desserts – orange chocolate brioche bread-and-butterpudding, anyone? The beauty of this is that it can be mostly prepared directly in the slow cooker; for the ideal texture, grab a tea towel, pull it taut over the bowl, slap the lid on top, and the towel will absorb the steam. After one hour on high, it’s good to go.Any no-gos? Rice. Risotto and rice pudding are the exceptions to this rule, because you want them to turn starchy, but fluffy, individual grains just won’t happen in a slow cooker. Also avoid fish and seafood, because they can go mushy. Squid and octopus could potentially go into a sauce to tenderise them, but I usually steer clear.Some SOS tips: if you have overcooked a stew and it’s a bit bland, add a splash of acid (lemon juice or vinegar) to bring the flavours back to life. If it looks a bit watery? Crack open the lid towards the end of cooking and leave to cook on high so some of the excess liquid evaporates (or strain the liquid into a separate saucepan and reduce to your desired consistency). And if your cooked meat is dry or tough, somewhat counterintuitively leaving it to cook for even longer can in some cases push it past dry and into mouthwatering.The slow cooker may not be the flashiest kitchen gadget, but it’s one of the few that are a blessing all year round. So don’t even think about letting it gather dust once the weather warms up: put some puttanesca sauce on the go and get back in the garden while the slow cooker does all the work for you.

Only three of the 21 passengers – including five children – could swim, the rest clung to empty gas canisters and tyres that had been attached to the boat.“To be honest, when the boat capsized, two of the children clung to me and I felt myself drowning, so I took a deep breath and let them go. God forgive me. I dived underwater so they would release me and hold on to the canisters instead.“There was nothing around me, but I could hear the women and children screaming, ‘Help us!’. At first, I was reciting prayers, but a sound behind me terrified me so much that I couldn’t even speak as I swam.

It was Ghaith’s second kidnapping and ransom demand since arriving in Libya last July.Ghaith and his family fled Syria 10 years ago when he was a teenager, as fierce battles raged between rebels and forces of the Assad regimein their home city of Manbij, in the northern region of Aleppo. His mother and father are now in their 50s and he has four siblings, the youngest of whom is four years old.View image in fullscreenPeople being evacuated from Manbij , Syria, in 2016, the year Ghaith attempted to return to the city. It was under IS control, so he returned to Lebanon.Photograph: Rodi Said/ReutersThey moved to Lebanon, living in Tripoli and later Beirut, but Ghaith says they faced a life of poverty,discriminationand the constant threat of deportation.

There is no turning back. It’s either reaching your goal or dying. I was ready for thatLast July, Ghaith decided to try to reachEuropevia Libya, which he says was the cheapest route to take. His trip was funded by selling the family home in Manbij for $10,300.After first arriving in Sabratha, a coastal city in western Libya under the control of militias, he contacted a local smuggler to try to join a group departing for Europe. He spent three weeks crammed in a warehouse with more than 200 other people before losing hope and contacting another smuggler who promised to take him to Europe for $5,500.In early August, at about 10pm he boarded a boat in the port of Zawiya with about 20 other migrants, which was later intercepted by a Libyan patrol boat. “They took everything from us: phones, nearly $10,000 in total, lifejackets. Even our food and water,” he says.Back on land, Ghaith and the other migrants were handed over to Libyan authorities and taken to Bir Al-Ghanam prison, south-west of Tripoli. After three days of extreme heat during the day, freezing nights and barely enough food to survive, Ghaith says he was told he would be able to leave if he paid a $2,400 ransom.View image in fullscreenThe Libyan coastguard during an operation to rescue migrants who attempted to reach Europe.Photograph: Taha Jawashi/AFP/Getty ImagesLibya is now the most common departure point for refugees and migrants arriving in Italy, butthousands have diedor been intercepted in the Mediterranean and returned to Libya, where they are likely to be held inunofficial detention centres.Once free, Ghaith contacted a third smuggler, who agreed to arrange his trip to Europe for $6,000. In late August, the intermediary transported him along with a pregnant woman and her husband to the place where they were supposedly going to embark. But when they arrived, they realised they were at a military base, far from the sea.Ghaith and the couple were told they had been kidnapped and that their release would cost 15,000 Libyan dinars [about £2,400] each. They were handed a mobile phone to contact relatives or intermediaries to arrange the ransom payment and spent nine days in a room with no mattress or blanket before being released.Once free, Ghaith joined the boat that would capsize at sea and end up with him being sold to local militia. After paying this latest ransom with the help of family and friends, he decided to make a fourth attempt.Lonely graves, scattered bones: the stark reality of one of the most overlooked and fastest-growing migration routesRead more“I couldn’t go back to Lebanon to my family because I was staying there illegally.

The will also gave key positions in Tom Benson’s estate to the teams’ president, Dennis Lauscha, and top spokesperson, Greg Bensel.The Saints’ proximity to the church spurred protests by clergy-abuse survivors in front of the team’s headquarters and at the offices of one of the oldest Catholic archdioceses in the US.View image in fullscreenMembers of the Survivors Network of Those Abused by Priests outside the New Orleans Saints and Pelicans training facility in Metairie, Louisiana, in 2020.Photograph: Matthew Hinton/APYet what remained hidden until now are more than 300 emails, amounting to more than 700 pages, many emblazoned with the NFL and NBA logos, showing that the teams’ officials were more involved with some of the church’s operations than they ever admitted. They expose how extensively the sports teams’ leaders intervened in their local church’smost unyielding scandal.In the most blatant example of that, Bensel – the teams’ vice-president for communications – wrote an email to Lauscha on 1 November 2018, the day before the clergy-abuse list was released. Using common abbreviations for “conference call” and “with”, Bensel wrote: “Had a cc w [New Orleans’ then district attorney] Leon Cannizzaro last night that allowed us to take certain people off the list.”But the teams said in a 2020 statement: “No one associated with our organizations made recommendations or had input on the individual names of those disclosed on the list.”On Saturday, the team also said: “No Saints employee had any responsibility for adding or removing any names from that list or any supplemental list. Nor did any Saints employee offer any input, suggestions or opinions as to who should be included or omitted from any such lists. Any suggestion that any Saints employee had any role in removing anyone from the archdiocese’s published lists of credibly-accused clergy is categorically false.”Meanwhile, when WWLLouisianaand the Associated Press asked him separately in 2020 if he had any input on the contents of the list, Cannizzaro – a self-described pious, practicing Catholic – denied it.“No,” Cannizzaro told WWL when asked that question. “We simply requested information from them. We requested documents from them, and they provided us documents of people that they believe were responsible for abuse.”Through an email from a spokesperson, Cannizzaro said to an Associated Press reporter that “he was not consulted about the composition of the archdiocese’s ‘credibly accused’ list nor did he or anyone from [his] office have input into its assembly”.Thank you Greg … I am certain [Archbishop Aymond] will appreciate itGayle Benson in a reply to an offer by Greg Bensel to help Aymond with ‘crisis communications’More recently, the Guardian obtained a typed phone message left for Cannizzaro at his office showing the archdiocese contacted him for comment requesting follow up “on conversation you had with Archbishop Aymond”. The date left on the message was 29 October 2018, four days before Aymond released the clergy-abuse list.Cannizzaro, for his part, said he isn’t sure he has ever met Bensel and “did not at any time ask the archdiocese or tell the Saints to tell the archdiocese … ‘remove this name from the list’.”“I would not have done that,” said Cannizzaro, who is now the chief of the criminal cases division at the Louisiana state attorney general’s office. “That’s just not something I would have done.”Another revelation in the emails: the sports franchises took the initiative to protect Aymond’s flagging reputation in the summer of 2018 without his asking for that, before the archbishop announced plans to release the names of dozens of abusive clergymen.Bensel sent an email in July of that year to Gayle Benson asking her to let him help Aymond with “crisis communications”. Benson – who counts Aymond as one of her best personal friends – replied to Bensel that same day: “Thank you Greg … I am certain he will appreciate it.”The pair exchanged those emails the day aftera damaging storyabout a deacon who had repeatedly faced criminal charges of child sexual abuse being allowed to read at masses – triggering one of multiple scandals in 2018 which pressured the church into releasing a list of credibly accused clergymen as a gesture of conciliation and transparency.View image in fullscreenNew Orleans Pelicans and Saints owner Gayle Benson next to the teams’ senior vice-president of communications, Greg Bensel, in New Orleans in 2022.Photograph: Matthew Hinton/APBensonclaimedin 2020 that Bensel only got involved in the local church’s messaging after being “asked if he would help the archdiocese prepare for the media relative to the release of clergy names involved in the abuse scandal”.On Saturday, an attorney for the Saints said Bensel did so in part at the suggestion of New Orleans-based federal judge Jay Zainey, a devout Catholic – who, according to the emails and time stamps from them, would have had to make that entreaty offline before the article on the abusive deacon was published or very shortly thereafter. Zainey has previously publicly acknowledged making such a suggestion, though he declined further comment on Saturday.The team’s attorneys on Saturday also said “other local civic leaders” asked Bensel to assist the archdiocese, though the lawyers did not say exactly when those requests were made.On Saturday, as they have done before, the Saints said Bensel’s role was limited to “public relations assistance provided to the archdiocese of New Orleans … in anticipation of press interest in the publication of a list of clergy who were credibly accused of abuse” on 2 November 2018.Bensel himself at one point wrote in the emails that he was presenting himself “not as the communications person for the Saints/Pelicans but as a parent, New Orleanian and member of the Catholic Church” – as well as a personal friend of Aymond. And the Saints on Saturday emphasized that “no compensation from the archdiocese was expected or received in return for Mr Bensel’s assistance”.But Bensel communicated directly with local media about their coverage of the clergy-abuse crisis using his Saints.NFL.com email address, bearing a signature line displaying two of the most recognizable logos in sports: the NFL’s shield and the NBA’s silhouette of a dribbling ball player. Lauscha and Benson used their Saints.NFL.com email addresses throughout the communications, too.And the emails also show Benson, Lauscha and Bensel continued to coordinate with the archdiocese on how to respond to news stories about the clergy-abuse crisis or other topics involving the organizations’ leaders for at least eight more months beyond the list’s release.On 21 June 2019, Bensel sent an email complaining that he did not “get paid enough” because he had to prepare the archbishop for an upcoming interview with New Orleans’ Advocate newspaper about clergy-abuse lawsuits and their effect on the church’s coffers. The regular email exchanges between team officials and the archdiocese ended only in July 2019, after a subpoena for the communications was issued to the Saints and theNFLby attorneys for clergy-abuse survivors who had detected evidence of them while pressing a lawsuit for damages on behalf of a victim.With the backing of various allies – including Benson, Zainey and future federal judge Wendy Vitter, then the archdiocese’s general counsel – the Saints and Pelicans officials used their influence to lean heavily on prominent figures in the local media establishment, pushing for them to soften their news coverage of Aymond, the emails show.Casting a critical eye on [Aymond] is neither beneficial nor rightGreg Bensel in a July 2018 letter to editors at the Times-Picayune and the Advocate newspapersBensel also sought to convince media outlets to limit their scrutiny of a list that turned out to be so incomplete it eventually precipitated a joint federal and state law enforcement investigation into whetherthe archdiocese spent decades operating a child sex-trafficking ringwhose crimes were illegally covered up.“Casting a critical eye on [Aymond] is neither beneficial nor right,” Bensel wrote in a July 2018 letter to editors at the Times-Picayune and the Advocate, the two daily New Orleans newspapers in existence back then.A year later, when an Advocate reporter emailed Bensel seeking a comment from the Saints and Pelicans about the subpoena issued to them and their powerful leagues, Bensel quickly forwarded it directly to the owner of that newspaper, John Georges, after unsuccessfully, and sarcastically, suggesting the journalist ask Georges for comment instead.The Saints’ officials statement on Saturday did not answer questions about Bensel’s remark to the reporter or his overture to Georges.The statement from the team’s lawyer said “no member of the Saints organization condones or wants to cover up the abuse that occurred in the archdiocese of New Orleans”.Separately, a statement from the Advocate and the Times-Picayune – which Georges has since acquired – said: “No one gets preferential treatment in our coverage of the news. Over the past six years, we have consistently published in-depth stories highlighting the ongoing serious issues surrounding the archdiocese sex abuse crisis, as well as investigative reports on this matter by WWL [Louisiana] and by the Associated Press.”Some of those WWL Louisiana reports the newspaper ran were produced in partnership with the Guardian.The newspapers’ statement said: “As the largest local media company in Louisiana, we often hear from community leaders, and we welcome that engagement, but it does not dilute our journalistic standards or keep us from pursuing the truth.”A statement from the archdiocese on Saturday echoed the Saints and Cannizzaro in saying “no one from the [team] or the New Orleans district attorney’s office had any role in compiling the [credibly accused] list or had any say in adding or removing anyone from the list”. It also characterized Bensel’s role from 2018 to 2019 as assisting “with media relations”, for which neither he nor the archdiocese were provided compensation.‘Dark days’The emails – obtained by the Guardian, WWL Louisiana, the Associated Press and the New York Times – came after Aymond tied his archdiocese to the lucrative sports teams owned by Benson in a way rarely, if ever, seen in the world of sports.A famously devout Catholic, prominent church donor and philanthropist who recentlywonan NFL humanitarian award, Benson inherited the Saints and Pelicans after her husband, Tom Benson, died at age 90 in March 2018. He bought the Saints in 1985 and the Pelicans in 2012. He threatened to move the Saints after Hurricane Katrina devastated New Orleans in 2005 but was convinced to stay.Tom Benson then became a hero and symbol of the city’s recovery from Katrina in 2010, when the Saints won their first – and so far only – Super Bowl title, igniting one of the region’s most ebullient celebrations ever.In Tom Benson’s final years, his children and grandchildren from a previous marriage squared off with Gayle, his third wife, over who would inherit control of his teams and other businesses. Lauscha and Bensel were widely seen to have aligned themselves with Gayle in a struggle that she won. And the succession plan that Tom Benson settled on in her benefit was laid out in a will.It left Gayle Benson in control of the sports teams and made Lauscha executor of Tom’s estate. And in the event Lauscha ever became unwilling or unable to fulfill his duties, they essentially would be split among two others of those most trusted by the Bensons: longtime Saints general manager Mickey Loomis – and Bensel.One of two witnesses to sign thatwillwas Aymond.View image in fullscreenGayle Benson walks to receive the casket of her husband, Tom Benson, with Archbishop Gregory Aymond in New Orleans in 2018.Photograph: Gerald Herbert/APAnd four months after the will took effect upon Benson’s death, a newspaper article about a local deacon and alleged serial child molester thrust Aymond into the center of the global Catholic church’s clergy-abuse scandal.Published by the Advocate, the article questioned how the deacon, George Brignac, had been allowed to keep reading scripture at masses despite his removal from public ministry 20 years earlier. Church officials had removed Brignac from ministry in 1988 after he’d been arrested multiple times on child molestation charges. The article also reported that the archdiocese had paid $550,000 to settle civil legal claims with a survivor of Brignac’s abuse who would later pursue a criminal case against him, though the clergyman would die before he could face trial.Subsequent reporting byWWL Louisiana and an Advocate journalistnow at the Guardian found that the church had quietly paid at least 15 other victims of Brignac a total of roughly $3m to settle their civil damages over their abuse at the deacon’s hands. Those payments were among nearly $12m in abuse-related settlements that the archdiocese doled out during a 10-year period beginning in 2010.Aymond immediately faced public backlash, with critics saying he had failed to live up to the promises of zero tolerance for clerical child molesters made by bishops across the US after a clergy-abuse and cover-up scandal had enveloped Boston’s Catholic archdiocese in 2002. He sought to limit the fallout by claiming that he was unaware that subordinates of his had brought Brignac back into a role that he insisted was largely inconsequential.But later investigations by the Associated Press, WWL Louisiana and the Advocate showed Brignac had also been cleared to meet with – andpresent lessonsto – children at a church school.The Brignac revelations, however, were not the last of Aymond and the church’s problems. A grand jury report issued in Pennsylvania in August 2018 established that Catholic clergy abuse in that state had been more widespread than the public ever previously realized. Cardinal Theodore McCarrick – a former archbishop of Washington DC – resigned amid allegations of child molestation as well as other sexual abuse, though he would later be deemed incompetent to stand trial due to dementia.And, in September 2018, the Advocate published a bombshell article by a journalist now at the Guardian about clergy abuse which implicated New Orleans’ Jesuit high school, the revered Catholic college preparatory from which both Lauscha and Bensel graduated.The articleoutlined how the high school quietly paid settlements to people who claimed that priests or other school employees sexually abused them as children. The school faced some of the same criticisms lobbed at Aymond after Brignac’s exposure. Jesuit high school’s leader at the time defended the institution by condemning the cases in question as a “disgusting” chapter in the school’s history – but one that was left far in its past.Bensel later wrote in an email to the school’s president that he was on Benson’s boat with Aymond when the story about Brignac came out – and the archbishop “was very troubled”.“These are dark days,” Bensel continued.The day after the Brignac story broke, Bensel wrote to Benson: “The issues that the Archbishop has to deal with that never involve him,” on top of a link to – and an attached copy of – the Advocate article about the molester deacon authored by a reporter now at the Associated Press.View image in fullscreenThe Saint Louis cathedral, the seat of the Roman Catholic archdiocese of New Orleans, andthe city’s archbishop, Gregory Aymond.Composite: Angelica Alzona/Guardian Design; Photos via Getty Images/APBenson wrote back suggesting that she had seen the article already. She said she had even spoken to Aymond about it “last week”, several days before its publication. “Archbishop is very upset,” Benson told Bensel. “A mess.”Bensel told Benson he was available to Aymond if the archbishop “ever wants to chat crisis communications”.“We have been through enough at [the] Saints to be a help or sounding board,” Bensel said, about six years after he guided the team through the infamous so-calledBountygatescandal that – among other consequences – resulted in the club’s coach at the time being suspended for an entire season. “But I don’t want to overstep!”Benson replied: “Thank you Greg, I will pass this on to him. I am certain he will appreciate it. Many thanks.”An August 2018 email that Benson sent to the Saints’ governmental liaison made clear how bad she felt for Aymond after the Brignac revelations. “Very sad he is going through this,” Benson wrote while sharing a separate letter by Aymond apologizing “for any wrongdoing by the church or its leadership”. The archbishop had issued the attached missive to a local chapter of a Catholic group called the Equestrian Order of the Holy Sepulchre of Jerusalem, which traces its origins to the First Crusade in the 11th century.Though Jesuit high school’s president back then, Christopher Fronk, later told a Sports Illustrated reporter now at the New York Times, “I never heard from the Saints on this issue” of church abuse, the emails show that he, too, was contacted by Bensel – just two days after his campus community was rocked by the September 2018 Advocate clergy molestation article.“Speaking from personal experience after 23 years with the Saints, when the media and the public attack you at your core, it takes the resolve and focus of people like yourself to lead us to clarity,” Bensel wrote. “The church needs leaders like you and I just wanted to reach out and say you have the support of myself, Dennis and Mrs Benson.“If I can offer any counsel on any issue, I am here for you.”Fronk, who left Jesuit high school in early 2020, replied: “Thanks for your email. I appreciate it. The last couple of days have been long, and I have more ahead of me. I am relying on prayers and support from others. And I may be taking you up on your wise counsel.”‘Work with him’Most of the Saints’ communications about clergy abuse focused on Aymond’s handling of the issue. And the strategy that the archbishop ultimately settled on was one implemented in other US dioceses. He would release a list of priests and deacons who served in New Orleans over the years and had been the subject of credible child molestation accusations.Aymond later told WWL Louisiana that he had contemplated such a maneuver a year before deciding to do so. And he claimed he would have reached that decision without the various local and national scandals consuming the Catholic church at the time, though he acknowledged they created pressure for him to act.Whatever the case, Bensel recommended “transparency” – a wholehearted effort to come clean about the past abuses and apologize for them. And with the list’s release being announced weeks ahead of time, the church would come to count on Bensel to get local media outlets to focus more on hailing Aymond for taking such a courageous step rather than analyzing the roster’s thoroughness.The campaign to set the media’s agenda began in earnest on 17 October 2018, when Bensel wrote to higher-ups at the Advocate as well as the Times-Picayune. He revealed to them that he had been “confidentially discussing the recent horrible issues that [Aymond] and the church are facing”. He also referred to chatting offline with the Advocate and Times-Picayune brass earlier that morning.I am asking that YOU as the most influential newspaper in our state, please get behind [Archbishop Aymond] and work with himGreg Bensel to higher-ups at the Advocate and the Times-Picayune newspapersIn his email to the newspapers, Bensel disclosed Aymond’s plan to out clergymen who “sadly betrayed their role and authority to minister to our children, the elderly and the sick”. And, though he anticipated the gesture would not “simply end all of the past and current suffering and questions”, he wrote that he had an urgent request for the outlets.“I am asking that YOU as the most influential newspaper in our state, please get behind him and work with him,” Bensel said, in part. “We need to tell the story of how this Archbishop is leading us out of this mess. Casting a critical eye on him is neither beneficial nor right.”He said the news media had helped the Saints maintain their footing in the NFL despite being in one of the league’s smallest markets. And he promised that Aymond would have an open-door policy, saying he is “accountable, available and wants to [e]ffect positive change”.“We need your support moving forward as we go through this soon-to-be messy time as we work toward much, much brighter days ahead,” Bensel said. “Help us tell this story.”The archbishop would later abandon that open-door policy. For years, Aymond has consistently declined interview requests from reporters at WWL Louisiana and the Guardian who have questioned his handling of the clergy-abuse crisis. Heusedthe word “Satan” when referring to one of those journalists, the former Advocate staff member, in a text message to a third party that was obtained by the writer.Bensel provided copies of the letters to the newspapers to Benson and Zainey, a sitting, locally based federal judge. The judge – a Jesuit high school alum who has served on the governing board of the New Orleans archdiocese-run college that educates prospective priests – replied: “Thanks very much Greg. You have hit all the points. By his example and leadership, Archbishop Aymond, our shepherd, will continue to lead our church in the right direction – helping us to learn and to rebuild from the mistakes of the past.”Benson, too, praised Bensel’s tone: “Great letter Greg … spot on! Thank you very much.”While it’s not clear when the paper first planned it, that same day the Times-Picayune published a column about the upcoming clergy-abuser list headlined: “Archbishop Aymond is doing the right thing.”A day later, Bensel wrote to the columnist, saying: “very good column on Archbishop Aymond”.Bensel then sent the column – along with the comments left under it by online users – to recipients including Aymond, Vitter (then still the archdiocese’s attorney) and Zainey. He said the comments – including one questioning “how come the church gets to decide who is ‘credibly accused’ and who is not”–were a valuable insight into the public’s psyche. And Bensel urged them not to “delve or hang on to the negative ones, [but] learn from them”.Praying for the Saints victory. Very grateful for your helpArchbishop Aymond to Greg BenselThe emails show how Bensel dedicated some of the following days to preparing Aymond for a meeting with editors of the Advocate, even while he was in Baltimore for a Saints game.“Praying for the Saints victory. Very grateful for your help,” Aymond wrote to Bensel at the time.Referring to the Advocate, Bensel urged Aymond to remember “they need you and you need them”. He said the goal of the gathering with the newspaper’s leadership should be to foster “a better relationship” and drive home how the church is providing “the best measures for a safe environment for our children”.Bensel suggested that the archbishop “not mention … that the general perception is that the ADVOCATE IS UNFAIR to the Archdiocese of New Orleans”. He also promised to “make time” to converse with Aymond about his advice despite being in and out of meetings.“POSITIVE POSITIVE POSITIVE,” Bensel wrote to Aymond. “INCLUSIVE ACCESSIBILITY ACCOUNTABILITY MOVING FORWARD.”Benson, Zainey and Vitter – who is married to a former Republican US senator and had already been nominated to a federal judgeship by Donald Trump in 2018 and wasconfirmedto the post the following year – were among those sent copies of correspondence about that meeting. “Excellent!” Benson remarked. “Many thanks!”Zainey, who later publiclysaidhe could not be sure whether he had ever been sent copies of any of the Saints emails, replied: “Thanks for the wonderful advice. The Arch[bishop]’s sincerity will open their minds and hearts.”(Zainey later recused himself from any rulings directly involving the archdiocese. But then he went on to rule in a case involving a Catholic religious order that a 2021 Louisiana law enabling clergy-abuse survivors to seek damages over decades-old child molestation was unconstitutional. The state supreme court subsequentlyupheldthe law’s constitutionality, effectively negating Zainey’s ruling.)After Aymond’s conversation with the newspaper, and after checking in with “a few folks” at the outlet, Bensel emailed Vitter, Aymond and the archdiocese’s in-house spokesperson, Sarah McDonald, saying that “the Advocate editorial meeting was fruitful, positive and I believe will have a lasting impact”. He said: “Great job by you all.”Yet Aymond would soon become incensed with the Advocate, which late that Octoberpublisheda roster of 16 clergymen who seemed to fit the criteria of the archbishop’s upcoming list based on publicly available news stories and court documents.Aymond wrote that the piece caught him off-guard, and he was particularly upset with how the newspaper’s website had asked clergy-abuse victims to contact the outlet to tell their stories rather than direct them to the archdiocese “to allow a proper investigation”.“I want to work with you, but we must both be transparent,” Aymond said. “Will people believe we are working together?”Upon being provided a copy of Aymond’s missive to the newspaper, Bensel quickly replied: “This is a GREAT response.”Emails show that the newspaper replied by saying it contacted McDonald prior to the publication of the report. The Advocate said it didn’t believe its editors’ earlier conversation with Aymond prevented it “from continuing … reporting”.Nonetheless, the Advocate informed Aymond that it had taken offline the request for victims to contact the newspaper, saying it was a “last minute addition” by a digital editor.Bensel later wrote to Aymond: “An excellent response from them.”‘Allowed us to take certain people off the list’The emails show that – 10 days before the documents were released – Aymond provided Bensel an early draft of a letter that the archbishop issued to churchgoers alongside his clergy-abuser list. Bensel replied with suggested changes in handwriting.A notable one: the draft had made it a point to say most of the accusations involved in the list “go back 30, 40, 50 or more years”. Bensel suggested stronger language, asserting that those accusations went back “decades – 30, 40, 50 and even 70 years ago”.The final letter evidently adopted that suggestion,reading: “Most of the accusations are from incidents that occurred decades ago, even as long as 70 years ago.”At last, Aymond’s clergy-abuser list came out the day after Catholics observed the Feast of All Saints and New Orleans’ NFL team celebrated the 52nd anniversary of its founding.Had a cc w Leon Cannizzaro last night that allowed us to take certain people off the [clergy-abuser] listGreg Bensel to Dennis Lauscha, using common abbreviations for “conference call” and “with”, and referring to New Orleans’ district attorney at the timeThelist– initially containing 57 names – was provided to media outlets that morning under an embargo, which prevents organizations from publishing information that was supplied to them prior to a specific time. And about three hours before that embargo expired, Lauscha emailed Bensel and asked: “Do you see any shockers on the list? Did your SJ you discussed yesterday make the list? The former Loyola president is the biggest shock to me.”Bensel’s quick reply did not address to whom “SJ” refers, though the letters are the initials of the Jesuit religious order’s formal name, the Society of Jesus. It also doesn’t comment on Bernard Knoth, a former president of the Jesuits’ Loyola University New Orleans, who was included on the clergy-abuser list.The Saints attorney’s statement on Saturday said Lauscha was referring to a clergyman “rumored to have been accused of abuse [and] was expected to be on the list”.View image in fullscreenDennis Lauscha.Photograph: WWLTV“It is Mr Lauscha’s understanding that the clergyman to whom he referred in his query to Mr Bensel was included on the list on a supplemental list,” the statement said.Regardless, back in early November 2018, Bensel’s reply read: “Had a cc w Leon Cannizzaro last night that allowed us to take certain people off the list.“This list will get updated, and that is our message that we will not stop here today.”The Guardian asked Cannizzaro about a 29 October 2018 typed message informing him of a call from Vitter. Vitter was “following up on conversation you had with Archbishop Aymond”, said the message left for Cannizzaro just four days before the list’s release.“If I was in a conversation with him, I would’ve been looking for any records he would have had relative to complaints made against priests so we could reach out to those victims to see if there was a prosecutable case,” Cannizzaro said.Meanwhile, Cannizzaro has denied a conversation with Bensel or any of his colleagues ever took place, including recently when he said in an interview: “I was not on any conference call with anybody from the Saints about this.“I do not ever remember having a conversation with the Saints about any case going on with our office” at that specific time.The Saints lawyer’s statement on Saturday also said that no one from the team spoke with Cannizzaro. Instead, Bensel’s email to Lauscha referred “to a conversation that he was told had occurred between a member of the staff of the archdiocese and … Cannizzaro, concerning the list”.“Mr Bensel has no firsthand knowledge of what was said by anyone during the conversation or in any communication between the archdiocese and the district attorney’s office,” said the Saints lawyer’s statement. “The … email refers to Mr Bensel’s understanding that the list would be updated by the archdiocese.“It was also Mr Bensel’s understanding that one purpose the archdiocese had in consulting with [Cannizzaro’s] office was to determine whether disclosure of any member of the clergy under consideration for inclusion on the list would interfere with a criminal investigation. Neither Mr Bensel nor any member of the Saints organization was involved in the determinations made by the archdiocese.”‘A strong and faithful message’On the day of the list’s release, McDonald had also asked Bensel to join Aymond as the archbishop gave interviews to local media outlets that they could not publish prior to the expiration of the embargo imposed on the document. “The archbishop would appreciate you being there for the Advocate especially,” McDonald wrote to Bensel.“I have blocked out the entire morning,” Bensel replied. “I will see you there.”In advance of those embargoed interviews, Lauscha sent Bensel 13 tough questions that Aymond should be prepared to answer. Lauscha suggested deflecting if asked about the number of listed credibly accused clergymen by answering, “One abuse is too many.”“Excellent,” Bensel replied to Lauscha, before forwarding the questions to McDonald as well as Vitter.The Saints’ statement on Saturday said: “The questions that Mr Lauscha suggested were intended to encourage openness and transparency.”Bensel attended the Advocate’s and WWL Louisiana’s separate embargoed interviews with Aymond. In the conversation with the Advocate, Aymond did remark: “One incident is too many.”Bensel remained silent during the interviews with both outlets. However, at some point later that morning, he emailed a Saints employee who had previously worked for the publisher of the Advocate.“I want [the Advocate publisher] to write a positive opinion about how this archbishop has handled the transparency of releasing these names and his diligence in making this right,” Bensel wrote to the Saints employee. “Will call to discuss.”There is no indication in the emails that the conversation Bensel sought took place. But the Advocate did publish an opinion column concluding with the words: “Transparency about grave wrongdoing, however painful, is the best way to help victims, serve parishioners, and support the work of the many church clerics who have brought joy, rather than suffering, to the people they promised to serve.”I hope the Picayune would show [Archbishop Aymond] … some support in an editorialGreg Bensel to the Times-Picayune opinion editorBensel also wrote to the Times-Picayune’s opinion editor, saying: “Today the Archbishop met face to face with all of the media – he sent a strong and faithful message!“I hope the Picayune would show him – the man – some support in an editorial – our community listens and values [what] you all have to say!!”The Times-Picayune’s next couple of print editions did not contain such an editorial. But as part of its news coverage about the list, the newspaper did publisha letterin its entirety by Christopher Fronk, Jesuit high school’s then president, that expressed support for Aymond’s release of the document, which contained the names of several abusive priests who had worked at Jesuit high school. Fronk’s letter hailed the disclosure as having been carried out in “a spirit of reconciliation and transparency”.Once the list’s embargo expired, Aymond granted his only live, on-air interview that day to radio talkshow host Newell Normand, a former sheriff of a suburban New Orleans area – at Bensel’s urging.Normand’s employer, WWL Radio, has long held the exclusive rights to the Saints’ local broadcasts. And Bensel brokered the conversation between Normand and Aymond through emails involving the director of the radio station, which – despite its call letters – is not affiliated with WWL Louisiana, the TV channel.McDonald, the archdiocese spokesperson, sent Bensel eight questions to “share with Newell to cover” two days before the interview. Bensel replied to McDonald, copied Normand as well as the host’s station director, and told the radio outlet’s employees: “These questions are a great framework for Newell.”“Love my Di,” Bensel wrote to the station director, referring to her by a nickname, after the organizations all agreed to the interview. She responded: “Love you too, GB.”Normand later asked Aymond at least four of the eight proposed questions in a fashion that was substantially similar – though not necessarily verbatim – to what the church suggested. The rest, Aymond answered unprompted.The suggested questions covered how law enforcement had been provided with a copy of the list; what emotions Aymond was experiencing that day; how the roster “is accurate” but may expand; and that adequate measures were in place for the archdiocese to protect children. Aymond said on the program that the number of priests on the list was relatively small given how many clergymen there had been in the archdiocese over the years, but that even that low tally was too much.As an example of the talking points, Aymond’s spokesperson suggested that Normand ask her boss, “What has this process been like for you?” After Bensel passed the questions along, Normand asked the archbishop, “I know your heart is broken over this – in going through this. How has this process been for you?”The suggestions from the church included: “There were earlier media reports that said the list may not be complete, but this is an extensive list going back very far. It seems comprehensive. (ask for response).”Normand didn’t ask Aymond that on the air. But according to a transcript, after the interview ended, the host remarked, “I know some folks say that they already believe that there are some names that have not been revealed yet, and [Aymond] has said that that is actually a possibility.”Normand, who has repeatedly criticized the church’s handling of the abuse crisis on air, did raise several issues with the archbishop that weren’t outlined by the archdiocese through Bensel. For example, he asked Aymond why the church didn’t inform law enforcement about allegations of abuse earlier. He also raised concerns about priests harassing other clergy. And he spoke about his own journey as a Catholic to accept that child molestation by priests was rampant.A statement on Saturday from the corporation that owns WWL Radio, Audacy, said: “WWL stands by its coverage of this story. We have no additional comment.”‘I don’t get paid enough’The volume of communications between the Saints and the church lessened after the release of the list, according to the emails. But the two sides still stayed in close contact for many more months.Between February and March of 2019, mere weeks after the Saints nearly clinched what would have been a second Super Bowl berth, the organizations communicated about a request from Aymond for Benson to submit to the Advocate a flattering letter to the editor. The letter’s purpose was to exalt the archdiocese and charitable programs it has led or participated in.Make as many edits as you see fitGreg Bensel to New Orleans church officials regarding a letter to the Advocate newspaperFor help on crafting the letter, the emails show that Bensel brought in some of the Saints’ media relations staffers who ordinarily facilitate sports journalists’ interviews with the team’s players and coaches. (One successfully suggested naming three Saints players who have been first-team All-Pro selections while touting their and Benson’s work with certain social or charitable programs, including an archdiocese-affiliatedfood bankto which she donated $3.5m in 2019.)Bensel gave the archdiocese the opportunity to review a draft of what he called “a very robust letter of support from Mrs Benson”, saying: “Make as many edits as you see fit.”He eventually distributed what he said Benson’s teams “came up with in conjunction with the archdiocese” among the Saints’ general counsel, their governmental liaison and Lauscha, according to the emails.“Do any of you see an issue with this???” Bensel wrote.General counsel Vicky Neumeyer replied: “I have to chime in that I don’t really like it. I don’t want [Benson] to appear to be a puppet for the archdiocese because we have way too many constituents from all walks of life.”Bensel wrote back to Neumeyer that he would come chat with her. She later sent an email saying she spoke with Lauscha and that all she meant to communicate was the letter “should be more personal and less stone-cold facts”.View image in fullscreenThe New Orleans Saints and Pelicans training and practice facility at the Ochsner sports performance center in Metairie, Louisiana.Photograph: Kirby Lee/Getty ImagesAfter Bensel submitted it in her name, Benson’s letter to the editor appeared inthe Advocate. Part of the letter addressed the local church’s work combating sex trafficking and advocating for children’s online safety, about five years before state police began investigating allegations that the archdiocese had allegedly sexually trafficked minors.“Many issues in our society are very difficult to talk about, such as pornography, online safety for children, drug abuse and sex trafficking,” the letter said. It also asserted that “the local Catholic Church is addressing these issues head-on”.The Saints’ statement on Saturday said that the letter was not “misleading” and did not excuse “the misconduct of members of the clergy”.Soon thereafter, for an Advocate story on the first anniversary of Tom Benson’s death, Bensel, McDonald and Aymond exchanged emails about the archbishop providing a statement praising Gayle’s support of the church in the first year of her Saints and Pelicans ownership. Gayle Benson and Bensel were given the chance to review and approve the statement, which read: “Mrs Benson is a woman of deep faith, and she puts her faith into action.”This is what we plan to send once we know you guys are good with thisGreg Bensel comment to New Orleans archdiocese about a statement from team owner Gayle BensonBensel, Benson, Lauscha, McDonald and Aymond all then communicated about an article that the Times-Picayune – which would be acquired by the Advocate weeks later – was preparing for Easter chronicling the early aftermath of the clergy-abuse list’s release. Benson had been asked for comment about how she perceived Aymond to have navigated that period. She gave Bensel permission to draft her statement – but to call Aymond “for his approval” prior to releasing it.Bensel then prepared a quote, sent it to McDonald, copied Aymond and said: “This is what we plan to send once we know you guys are good with this.”The published quote from Benson that Aymond signed off on read: “My personal relationship with the archbishop aside, I believe he has shown tremendous leadership and guidance through this very tough time. In my opinion, he has dealt with this very sad issue head on, with great resolve and determination to do the right thing and to do it as fully transparent as he is allowed.”Bensel then emailed Benson, Lauscha and Aymond a link to that Times-Picayunearticleonce it was published. “Thank you, Greg,” Benson wrote back to Bensel.As late as June 2019, Bensel was still helping the archdiocese with its crisis communications, preparing Aymond for an interview with the Advocate about the effect of the clergy-abuse scandal in general onchurch finances. “I don’t get paid enough – Helping the Archbishop prep for his 9 am meeting,” he wrote in an email to his ex-wife, after Aymond copied him on to a chain of communications about the upcoming interview.A subpoena would put an end to the Saints and the church’s email correspondence about a month later.‘We are proud’The Saints and archdiocese’s decision to coordinate their messaging created a headache for the organizations after it became clear that Aymond’s list had raised more questions than it answered. Numerous clergy molestation survivors came forward complaining that their abusers were omitted from the list, even in cases in which the church said it believed their allegations and had paid them substantial financial settlements.The list did not provide the number of accusations against each clergyman or say exactly when they worked at the local churches to which they were assigned. That concerned the clergy-abuse survivor community, who worried the paucity of information might be an impediment for unreported victims contemplating coming forward.It also concerned Cannizzaro’s top assistant district attorney, Graymond Martin, who responded to receiving the list by drafting a request on 8 November 2018 for more information, including basics such as any details indicating “where the alleged acts occurred, … when each act … occurred and some description of each of the alleged acts”.Martin sent that draft to a subordinate. But it is unclear whether the request was formally sent to the archdiocese.In his radio interview with Normand, Aymond emphasized that the archdiocese would be reporting complaints against living clergy to law enforcement. Bensel’s email indicated he consulted with Martin’s boss, Cannizzaro, about the list before its release. But Martin’s email noted that the DA’s office still had not received “copies of any documentation … of these complaints and the results of any inquiry conducted by the Archdiocese”.Cannizzaro filed charges of child rape against one person on the list: George Brignac, in connection with the allegations at the center of the $550,000 settlement paid to one of his victims in July 2018. But Brignac, 85, died in 2020 while awaiting trial on charges that dated back to the late 1970s and early 1980s, sparing the church a courtroom spectacle.The church did not catch the same break nearly five years later, after Cannizzaro’s successor as DA, Jason Williams, intervened in civil lawsuits and subpoenaed secret documents from the archdiocese to pursue child rape charges against a local priest named Lawrence Hecker.Hecker’s name had not been disclosed until the list came out, even though he had been removed from ministry in 2002 because he was a suspected abuser. A survivor then accused Hecker of raping him when he was an underage Catholic high school student in 1975 – a crime that until then had not been disclosed to authorities and had no deadline before which prosecutors had to file charges.The prosecution of Hecker kicked into high gear in the summer of 2023, when the Guardian and WWL Louisiana began publishing a series of reports on awritten confessionfrom the priest to his church superiors in 1999 that he had sexually molested or harassed several children during his career. The outlets also got Hecker to confess to being a serial child molesteron cameraand showed how the church took steps to deliberatelyhidethe extent of his abusive history for decades beforehand.Ultimately, Williams’ office charged Hecker with the former student’s 1975 assault. Hepleaded guiltyin December of last year at age 93 to child rape and other crimes, and hediedin prison less than a week after receiving a mandatory life sentence.Meanwhile, evidence turned up by Hecker’s prosecution prompted the state police investigator who built the case against him to swear under oath that he had probable cause to suspect the archdiocese ran a child sex-trafficking ring responsible for the “widespread … abuse of minors dating back decades”. That abuse was concealed from authorities beyond just Hecker’s case, and an investigation into the matter that could generate criminal charges against the clerical molesters’ protectors was ongoing, the sworn statement said.Though Hecker and Brignac were on the initial version of the list, it eventually grew from 57 names to about 80.A number of the additions came only after news media reported on conspicuous omissions, including two –Robert CooperandBrian Highfill– added after WWL Louisiana and an Advocate reporter now at the Guardian questioned the archdiocese about them. Two otheradditionsinvolved clergymen who alsopleaded guilty– albeit in suburban New Orleans communities – to sexually molesting children, either before or after their ordination.The deluge of claims eventually drove the archdiocese to file for bankruptcy protection in the spring of 2020.That proceeding – which remained ongoing as of the publication of this report – led to more than 500 abuse claims againstmore than 300clergymen, religious brothers and sisters, and lay staffers. The archdiocese does not consider most of those as being credibly accused, saying it only has the authority to include clergymen – priests and deacons – on its sanctioned list. And it could cost the archdiocese hundreds of millions of dollars in payments to clergy-abuse victims to settle the bankruptcy, if the church even manages to do so successfully.Saturday’s statement from the Saints’ lawyer said Benson would not donate money to the archdiocese for it to settle with clergy molestation survivors.“That abuse occurred is a terrible fact,” the statement continued. “As a member of the Catholic faith, Mrs Benson will continue to support the church and the great things it does. Her support is unwavering, but she has no intention of donating funds to the archdiocese to pay for settlements with abuse victims, and she has not done so.”As all the disparate cases leading to the church bankruptcy made spectacular headlines, the Saints emails remained hidden for years. And the reasons for that are complex.The communications had been produced as evidence in an unresolved civil lawsuit involving allegations against Brignac – the deacon who had been charged with sex crimes multiple times since the 1970s but had been reading at masses as recently as the summer of 2018.In July 2019, the attorneys for that pending lawsuit’s plaintiff – who have also represented victims of Hecker – raised eyebrows byissuing a subpoenafor copies of all communications among Saints and archdiocesan officials. The attorneys wrote in an accompanying court filing that the subpoena was necessary because the case’s discovery process turned up emails as well as other evidence establishing that Bensel was advising the archdiocese on how to navigate its clergy-abuse crisis.News media outlets almost immediately began trying to access and report on the emails. Bensel was not pleased with their interest. Beside asking Lauscha over email to call his cellphone, he told an Advocate reporter seeking comment on the subpoena to instead ask his newspaper’s owner, John Georges. Bensel then said his organization had nothing to say on the subpoena, echoing an email to him from Lauscha which read: “As with any legal matter, we have no comment.”The last of the “Saints emails” shows that Bensel forwarded the reporter’s request for comment to Georges. There is no indication in the emails that Georges responded.In short order, WWL Louisiana, the now-combined Times-Picayune/Advocate newspaper and two other local television stations joined the Associated Press in suing for access to the emails. The media argued that the missives were a matter of public interest. Attorneys for the Saintsarguedthat its correspondence with the church should remain private – while also maintaining that they had merely provided public relations advice to the archdiocese and had done nothing to be ashamed of.View image in fullscreenArchbishop Gregory Aymond and Gayle Benson during Fat Tuesday celebrations in 2020 in New Orleans.Photograph: Jonathan Bachman/Getty ImagesThey explicitly denied having had “a hand in determining which names should or should not have been included on the pedophile list”, as the attorneys who obtained the subpoena put it.“We are proud of the role we played and yes, in hindsight, we would help again to assist the archdiocese in its ability to publish the list with the hope of taking this step to heal the community,” Benson wrote ina statement. “I want to be clear … that I am not going to be deterred in helping people in need, whether a friend seeking advice or a stranger in need, it does not matter, our list is long.”In what seemed to be directed at news organizations whose businesses depend to some extent on credentialed access to – or advertising and broadcasting rights from – the Saints and Pelicans, the statement also said: “I hope that is not lost on the same people that write such articles when they too come asking for help or support.”On Saturday, the Saints’ statement said Benson was “proud of her executive team and supports them”.“While the public relations assistance offered to the archdiocese has come under scrutiny, Mrs Benson and her team remain steadfast in bringing our community together and continuing to help the good people of our community,” the Saints’ statement said.Nonetheless, the New Orleans archdiocese opted to move on from relying on Bensel after the July 2019 subpoena. It later retained a crisis communications consultant from a local firm at a cost of $10,000 monthly, public court filings have shown.The media’s efforts to secure the Saints emails hit a significant snag when the Covid-19 pandemic shut down the local court system beginning in March 2020.Then, on 1 May 2020, the archdiocese filed forbankruptcy. The move automatically and indefinitely halted litigation pending against the archdiocese.The state court judge overseeing the case that produced the Saints emails never determined whether or not the emails were confidential.As part of the bankruptcy proceedings, there were confidentiality orders applied to various archdiocesan documents. One of the primary justifications for such orders was to protect the identities of clergy-abuse victims.In the correspondence between the Saints and the church that the Guardian and WWL Louisiana reviewed, no clergy-abuse victims are identified.Nonetheless, the Saints lawyer’s statement on Saturday alleged that the emails were “leaked to the press in violation of a court order”. The statement also complained that the team was confronted with those communications as New Orleans prepared to host the Super Bowl showdown between the Kansas City Chiefs and the Philadelphia Eagles on 9 February.“The team and the entire city are committed to hosting the greatest Super Bowl week and game ever,” the team’s statement said.Ultimately, journalists managed to obtain and expose the emails.One of those journalists was the first to expose Brignac before joining the Associated Press. Another investigated the Saints’ connection to Aymond in Sports Illustrated before joining the New York Times. And two contributed significantly to efforts to bring Hecker to justice at WWL Louisiana and the Guardian.In the US, call or text the Childhelp abuse hotline on 800-422-4453 or visit their website for more resources and to report child abuse or DM for help.

In Oakland, an attorney published a post on Instagramalleging raids were occurring around the Bay Area. And in the Central valley, a medical clinic serving migrant farm workers saw patient numbers drop afterrumors claimed Ice agents were targeting its patients.The events are part of a broader trend in which mounting anxieties about mass deportations under a second Trump administration are spawning potentially dangerous falsehoods about sweeps and mass arrests. And to stoke fears even further, the administration is spreading its own rumors about sweepsto make the threat appear more immediate and widespread.In response, hyper-local non-profit newsrooms around California are acting as vanguards against misinformation, filling an important gap as falsehoods proliferate on social media and sow distrust in mainstream news sources. They are developing toolkits, publishing resource guides, and training readers in media literacy. And with expansive networks in their communities, these journalists are fostering a level of trust that enables them to connect and resonate with readers who can be hard to reach.“Panic works to the benefit of Ice,” said Junyao Yang, a reporter withMission Local, an outlet serving San Francisco’s Mission District, one of the city’s most historic and diverse neighborhoods. “We have a responsibility to our neighbors who are immigrants in the Mission to tell them things they need to know.”In the days that followed the Kern county sweeps, Gisselle Medina, a journalist at the publicationFresnoland, was startled by the quantity and specificity of misinformation they saw on social media, including warnings that border patrol agents were monitoring major downtown intersections and claims that Ice agents were descending on a popular mall.But when Medina did some factchecking – contacting local non-profits, calling watch networks, and scanning law enforcement Facebook pages – they were unable to verify the claims. “No one knew what was happening,” Medina said. “Community members here in Fresno specifically were just very terrified.”So Medina used the Fresnoland platform to get ahead of the noise and create an accessible resource that immigrant readers and community members could go to for answers. They drafted anarticlethat outlined what had happened in neighboring Kern county in the days before, including information about the people arrested and agencies involved, as well as notes on the details that remained fuzzy. Then, Medina listed the contact information for local immigrant services organizations and laid out steps for immigrants to take in the event of an encounter with immigration enforcement, such as not carrying documentation about their immigration status on their person.“I wanted to create a one-stop shop for people to reference and go back to over the next four years and beyond,” Medina said.View image in fullscreenCommunity members cut out red cards, which describe immigrants’ constitutional rights.Photograph: Rebecca Noble/ReutersMission Local’s Yang had a similar idea when she published a story on 17 January headlined “PSA: What immigrants should know in the time of Trump”. An explicit response to the impending inauguration, the piece offered readers phone numbers to call for legal assistance or to report Ice activities, explained that immigrants are not legally required to disclose their legal status to law enforcement, and provided a link for readers to download and print their ownred card, a brightly colored piece of paper developed by the Immigrant Legal Resource Center that invokes immigrants’ constitutional rights.The response was positive, Yang said, and the impact validating. “It was very powerful to see how you have this direct connection with your readers,” she said.Employing the tools of service journalism – from publishing how-to guides to coordinating media training sessions – to combat misinformation is something California’s local non-profit news organizations have been leaning into for years.Since 2021,El Tímpano, a Spanish- and Mam/Mayan-language media organization in the Bay Area, has facilitateddisinformation defense workshopsthat teach community members how to identify and dispel falsehoods. And in the lead-up to last year’s elections,Cityside, a non-profit online media organization serving the San Francisco area’s East Bay, published atool to help readers decode political mailersand hosted information sessions forlocal high schoolers voting in school board elections for the first time, while the staff at Mission Local delivered printed copies of their normally online-only reporting in Spanish and Chinese to monolingual pockets of the city. (The Guardian US has partnered with Mission Local, and the Guardian US’s managing director previously advised the launch of Cityside.)‘Fear hasn’t paralyzed us’: anxiety and action in Chicago amid immigration raidsRead moreAnd the demand for local journalists’ resources and expertise is only growing, newsroom leaders say. “We’ve had more requests than ever since the election from community partners asking us to bring our workshop to them,” said El Tímpano’s founding director, Madeleine Bair.Cityside’s community journalism director, Jacob Simas, says the shift represents a broader transition in how the obligations of local newsrooms to their surrounding communities are understood. “We need to see ourselves as service providers,” Simas said. “We’re providing what we think is a really critical service to our communities, which is trustworthy, credible reporting and information resources that people can actually use to better their lives.”Doing that work well involves nurturing deep ties with local residents and organizations – both so that local journalists can quickly and dependably verify truths or debunk falsehoods, and so that community members see local newsrooms as trusted messengers.“We have lived here, we have families here, we come from the communities that are being targeted,” said Alma Martinez, executive director of the Central Valley Journalism Collaborative (CVJC), which operates and funds community news initiatives around the state. “That builds trust. That’s the secret sauce.”And it requires putting the fight against misinformation front and center, she added.“Even news organizations can get duped. We have to lead by example and make sure we’re providing news that is truthful, that’s objective, and that gets to the heart of what is happening.”Explore more on these topicsUS immigrationCaliforniaUS press and publishingNewspapers & magazinesWest CoastfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Now, volunteers are teaching them about safe sexSupported byAbout this contentAmrit Dhillonin DelhiMon 3 Feb 2025 02.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 3 Feb 2025 04.16 ESTShareAt a roadside booth, a volunteer pulls a condom over a wooden phallus. “Feel the packet first. If it feels dry, don’t use it, it’s past the expiry date,” he tells his audience of truck drivers as the traffic speeds by behind them.A short distance away, transgender sex workers Ruby and Bhavna are urging truckers clustered around a tea stall to ignore some common myths.“Don’t think that sprinkling lemon juice on your penis after unprotected sex is going to protect you against HIV. Nor will having sex with a virgin cure you. Only condoms will protect you and your families,” says Ruby, 30. The men listen attentively.Groups working to educate Indian lorry drivers on how to avoid sexually transmitted diseases and HIV have long sought to enlist commercial sex workers. It’s their services that drivers seek at truck stops, during the weeks and even months that they are on the road, away from their families.Apollo Tyres Foundation, the corporate social responsibility (CSR) arm of the country’s largest tyre manufacturer, is working with transgender sex workers after studies showed that some drivers prefer them.“It’s often not spelled out. Sometimes, drivers say they prefer transgender sex workers because they are cheaper and more accessible. That’s true up to a point. But they also cite this reason to conceal their real preference for them and for anal sex,” says Rinika Grover, Apollo Tyres’ head of sustainability and CSR.The company sells tyres to transport companies. About 60% of its revenue comes from buses and trucks, whose drivers are a high-risk group for HIV, with aprevalence rate of 1.48%, seven times higher thanIndia’s national average of 0.2% for adults.If you have symptoms, who do you go to? No, not some local quack – you go to a proper doctorBhavna, transgender sex workerThe foundation has taken on more than 100 transgender sex workers as part of its HIV/Aids outreach project. They work as volunteers, making drivers aware of the risks, the symptoms, prevention and treatment. Some transgender people have been taken on as paid staff.To an outsider, their advice can sound jarringly obvious but it is necessary. “If you have symptoms, who do you go to?” asks Bhavna, 34, during the drivers’ tea break. “No, not some local quack. You go to a proper doctor with the initials MBBS after his name.”She explains later that the tendency is for drivers to seek an easy and cheap solution from an unlicensed practitioner, who will typically advise them to rub baking soda or mustard oil on their genitals or apply a paste made from certain leaves.She and Ruby quiz the drivers to gauge their level of awareness. It’s just as well. How do you get HIV? “Lack of hygiene,” offers one. How do you get sexually transmitted diseases (STD)? “Through sharing food,” says another.The transgender volunteers know the truckers’ world well. On a cold, grey winter’s day, they are targeting drivers at the Sanjay Gandhi transport hub in north-east Delhi. It’s a dusty, grim wasteland next to a landfill, with black birds of prey circling above them.Here, rows and rows of truckers load, unload, refuel, get repairs done and eat. Alongside, in alleys and grimy parks, they buy the services of transgender sex workers. Both groups are severely deprived, exist on the margins of society and are united by their poverty.The drivers are mostly sockless in sandals and wearing thin layers that cannot keep out the cold. Their last shower and hot meal are a distant memory. It is not very different for the sex workers. The shared experience encourages trust, which is why the drivers listen to their advice, often delivered in street language.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toGlobal DispatchFree newsletterGet a different world view with a roundup of the best news, features and pictures, curated by our global development teamEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Amit Chaudhary, programme lead for Apollo’s foundation, says: “We also refer drivers to our health centres across India, which provide HIV-testing services and counselling, free medicines, treatment for other STDs, testing for tuberculosis and also vision.”The transgender project began in 2022 and has since reached more than 100,000 truck drivers. The benefits work both ways.Transgendersex workers, accustomed to being despised by society and living in the shadows, enjoy the increase in social status that the volunteer work affords them, even if it can sometimes result in a loss of income.Normally, they would never dream of entering the office of a multinational company. Now, entrusted with the job in hand, the office becomes their space too and their self-respect rises a notch or two.“It’s been a great job for me,” says Mayra Mehraf, 22, now a paid employee after being trained as a health educator. “Seeing me encourages other transgenders to realise they can do more than sex work or begging at traffic lights.”Back in his driver’s cab, Ashok Kumar, whose route is the 400 miles (650km) from Delhi to Jammu, says it has been time well spent.“I knew some of what they said but I learned some new things too. I liked the way Ruby said one condom will protect two people – me and my wife.”Explore more on these topicsGlobal developmentSexual healthTransgenderSex workHealthIndiaSouth and central AsiafeaturesShareReuse this content"

Someone’s in a boat going over the top of our cane paddock.”But for a patch of grass around their house on which their cattle and horses shiver and nibble, the whole Bosworth farm at Blackrock, a few kilometres south of the north Queensland rural town of Ingham, is under water.Somehow Bosworth sounds relaxed and composed – despite admitting she has never seen anything like whatshe is seeing right now.“We’ve been here since the late 1990s, so we were here for Larry and Yasi and all the big floods since then,” she says, rattling off the names of category 4 and 5 cyclones like slightly challenging relatives. “And we’ve got the most water we’ve ever had in our time here.”For many of the 4,500 or so people in the sugar cane town about 100km north of Townsville, boat has suddenly become the only means of transport.View image in fullscreenGeorgina and Donal Bosworth, who live just south of Ingham on a cane farm that is completely submerged except for a patch of grass around the house at which their cows and horses are sheltering.Photograph: Georgina and Donal BosworthDays of torrential rain –including more than 1 metre that fell during a 48-hour period in parts of the tropical north– have submerged fields and inundated the town, forcing evacuations and sweeping away a bridge on the Bruce Highway that connects it to Townsville.“It’s gone,” Bosworth says of the vital Ollera Creek Bridge. “It’s basically been water-blasted out from underneath.”Not everyone on a boat around Ingham will be idly punting around. Some are fleeing for higher ground as their houses go under. A 63-year-old woman died in Ingham on Sunday when a State Emergency Service rescue boat carrying six people hit a tree and flipped into the flood waters.Others may need resources. Power was cut on Sunday when the Ingham electricity substation went under water. People are resorting to gas cookers – hence the rarity of a hot cuppa. With no refrigeration in the dank of the tropics, perishable food has already turned.Another resource in short supply is one that – on first take at least – may seem counterintuitive for the wettest patch of Australia receiving what may prove to be its most substantial inundation in living memory: water. Treated water, that is.“The water treatment plant in town doesn’t have power either,” Bosworth says. “I saw on socials that maybe there’s five days of water that’s treated available for the district – if we’re conservative.”The Bosworths have already filled up their bathtub and other containers with water.Then there are the other reasons people may need to move, the kind of highly specific reasons that don’t spring to mind for the rest of us, safely removed from the flood zone, watching coverage from a distance.View image in fullscreenAn aerial view of flooded Ingham.Photograph: Queensland Ambulance ServiceLike, for example, one of Bosworth’s clients who lives nearby. For not only is Bosworth a sugar cane farmer – she is a midwife.“Her guess date was yesterday,” she says of her client. “And I say ‘guess date’ deliberately, because nobody knows when the baby’s coming.”Thankfully, as of Monday morning, there were no signs of labour, because Bosworth does not believe it would be possible for her to get to her client’s home by car.“But that doesn’t mean we can’t get to each other,” she says. “Country people are very resourceful.”And the people of Ingham and surrounding areas are going to have to draw upon all of that resourcefulness.Some of the perils they face are immediate and terrifying in nature: a saltwater crocodile was said to have swum through the streets of Ingham.1:32Residents capture footage of severe floods in north Queensland – videoOthers will emerge over the days, weeks and months that are to follow, says the Hinchinbrook Community Support Centre general manager, Linda McClelland.A “born and bred” Ingham local, McClelland is stuck in Townsville and has no idea when or how she will be able to return home. Which is just as well, really. Though Townsville too is copping a hammering and some of its residents have been warned to abandon their homes, McClelland has access to power and the resources she needs to start coordinating a response.Which is much more than can be said for those at “ground zero”, she says.“It’s getting quite critical for those people who don’t have access to generators,” McClelland says. “They’re without power, their phones are going down, communication’s starting to reduce and they’re potentially running out of food.North Queensland floods: hundreds evacuated, dozens rescued as 1.2m of rain dumped in some areasRead more“The SES have a huge list of people who have requested evacuation … People who thought they might have been OK at home are now changing their minds, because the water’s getting higher and higher.”Many, she says, have prepared for a typical flood, using “the great flood of 1967” as a yardstick – “but this flood was not typical”.“Properties that have never been inundated in the past have been inundated,” McClelland says.The veteran social services worker is concerned about the emotional toll as well the physical threat the flood poses.“I’m really worried about the mental wellbeing of my community over the next few days,” she says.Now, many are trapped in their homes, racked with worry about dwindling resources and rising waters. Soon, though, the flood water will recede and they will be faced with thick-mud-covered yards, homes and vehicles, and “the big cleanup will start”.“There will be the stench of mud as it starts to dry out once the sun comes out,” McClelland says. “It will be incredibly hot and moist, and the footpath will be running with black mud as people start hosing out, and we’ll start seeing belongings littering footpaths.“That, psychologically, has a big impact on the community.”View image in fullscreenRecent Ingham resident Janice Flores is stuck with her two children without power or running water while her partner, who’s on a mine site, cannot get back home.Photograph: Janice FloresAnd not everyone has dealt with the likes of it before.Janice Flores and her family moved from the western Queensland outback town of Longreach to Ingham less than a year ago. They are without power or running water and the flood waters are lapping at the edges of her street.Flores’ partner works out of town in the mines and can’t return home anytime soon, leaving her to care for her two children, aged 13 and three, on her own. Trapped at home, the kids are fluctuating between being bored, frightened and overwhelmed.Overnight on Sunday the wind picked up and the rain bucketed down.“It’s really quite scary,” she says. “I think I haven’t been sleeping the last few days very well.“Emotionally, it’s all a bit overwhelming.”As she tries to keep the children entertained, salvage food and move belongings higher up, Flores is kicking herself for not being “100% prepared”. Still, she has done more than might have been expected for a new arrival in town.Flores thought to run and plug the bath while she still had tap water and has been filling buckets and containers with rainwater for days. When her phone battery died and she could not be contacted, a friend brought over a charger that could be connected to her car battery. She has a supply of canned food.“We should be OK for the next two to three days, hopefully,” Flores says. “I don’t know what happens after that.”Explore more on these topicsAustralia weatherQueenslandDavid CrisafullifeaturesShareReuse this content"

The women wore spectacular turquoise earrings made from the feathers of a rainforest bird called the plum-throated cotinga. Their biceps were adorned with leaves.“Today the Yanomami people are no longer crying because our children are no longer dying,” Hekurari told the meeting, recalling how his people had been pushed to the brink of destruction in recent years as tens of thousands of illegal miners invaded their lands and Brazil’s previous government abandoned them to their fate.View image in fullscreenJúnior Hekurari Yanomami speaks to Yanomami villagers to discuss the future of their territory.Photograph: João Laet/The GuardianNow, however, the 38-year-old Yanomami leader believed things were looking up. Two years after Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva became president andlaunched an emergency operationto rescue inhabitants of Brazil’s largest Indigenous territory, hunger and infant mortality rates were falling and many miners had been expelled.“We are recovering,” Hekurari said, publicly thanking Lula for sending hundreds of troops and health workers to his inaccessible region to kick out the miners and save Yanomami lives.Amazon graphicThe optimism on show during the four-day summit in Kori Yauopë comes after a profoundly traumatic spell for the estimated 32,000 Indigenous people who live in about 390 villages in the Yanomami territory, a Portugal-sized ocean of rainforest along Brazil’s Amazon border with Venezuela.Under Lula’s far-right predecessor Jair Bolsonaro, the government largely washed its hands of responsibility as criminal mining gangs stormed the supposedly protected Indigenous area, flattening forests, poisoning rivers, and terrorising Indigenous communities which had had little previous contact with the outside world.Government health centres were hijackedor burned down by minersand malaria, malnutrition, sexual violence and disease ripped through far-flung villages, as Bolsonaro’s administration busied itself dismantling Indigenous health services and environmental protections. Guns distributed by miners aggravated deadly inter-ethnic conflicts previously fought with bows and arrows and clubs. “If that isn’t genocide, I don’t know what is,” said Ana Paula Pina Borges, a veteran Indigenous health specialist and gynaecologist who is among hundreds of medical workers now picking up the pieces.View image in fullscreenJúlio Ye’kwana sails down a river near Fuduuwaaduinha carrying Indigenous people and medicines.Photograph: João Laet/The GuardianAt the invitation of the Brazilian government and Indigenous leaders, the Guardian visited the Yanomami territory last month to gauge the success of Lula’s two-year crusade to bring South America’s largest relatively isolated tribe back from the brink.Five years earlier, Indigenous activists had invited the British journalistDom Phillips, whose 2022 murder in the Amazon shocked the world, to the same region, hoping he would draw global attention to the 21st-century gold rush putting Yanomami lives at risk. Júlio Ye’kwana, whose people also inhabit the Yanomami territory,took the reporter to Tatuzão, an immense jungle excavation where illegal miners were hard at work. “The world had to know what was happening,” Ye’kwana recalled.View image in fullscreenAerial view of the Yanomami Indigenous territory with the Uraricoera River.Photograph: João Laet/The GuardianFive years later, the activist had a happier tale to tell as he offered a tour of the village of Fuduuwaaduinha, where he grew up, about 100 miles north-west of Kori Yauopë. “Things are improving,” Ye’kwana said, describing how troops had closed many of the region’s gold and cassiterite mines, including Tatuzão.At the local clinic – one of many beefed up or reopened by Lula’s government in partnership with the humanitarian group Médecins Sans Frontières – health professionals celebrated the drop in malnutrition and infant mortality since the emergency campaign began.Ruama Rosendo, one of 36 nutritionists working in the Yanomami territory, compared with just five before, said the centre once received up to 80 patients a day. “Now, it’s 10 or 12 at most,” the 25-year-old added, describing her joy at seeing one emaciated child patient turn into a chubby bundle of fun.View image in fullscreenMaurício Ye’kwana, chief of Yanomami Health, visits a health centre near FuduuwaaduinhaPhotograph: João Laet/The Guardian“Hope has returned,” said Maurício Ye’kwana, an Indigenous leader recently put in charge of healthcare in the Yanomami region by the ministry of health.Massive challenges remain, not least the Indigenous territory’s proximity to the humanitarian meltdown in Venezuela, which is also home to Yanomami communities and where illegal mining continues to boom. Fuduuwaaduinha is only 10 miles from Venezuela and Maurício Ye’kwana saidmembers of the Yanomami and Sanumá peoples, who roam freely across both sides of the border, were bringing back illnesses such as malaria from mines there and contaminating Brazilian villages.View image in fullscreenYanomami villagers gathering in Kori Yauopë.Photograph: João Laet/The GuardianA few days earlier, a Sanumá mother arrived at the clinic near Fuduuwaaduinha after a six-day footslog through the rainforest from Venezuela – which lacks Brazil’s robust national health service – with her listless and underfed baby. The five-month-old boy was airlifted to the nearest Brazilian city for treatment but died. “He weighed 3kg,” said Eliane Balieiro, the nurse who tried to save him, showing a photograph of the skeletal child on her phone.Nor have illegal miners been completely dislodged, despite government pledges that they would be. During the two-hour flight to Fuduuwaaduinha, at least one active mine could be seen polluting the Uraricoera River, although many others appeared to have been abandoned. A suspected mining plane was seen cruising over the canopy towards Venezuela.View image in fullscreenNilton Tubino, head of the government taskforce that is coordinating efforts to expel illegal miners from the Yanomami Indigenous Land, chairing a meeting last month.Photograph: João Laet/The GuardianNilton Tubino, who leads a federal government taskforce coordinating Lula’s eviction campaign, said mining gangs were changing tactics in order to continue their multibillion-dollar assault on nature.Bush pilots who transport miners and equipment to jungle camps were thought to be hiding their aircraft over the border in Venezuela, where Brazilian troops could not destroy them. To avoid being spotted by satellites, miners were digging pits in even more remote areas under the cover of trees, rather than clearing large chunks of rainforest. Some worked by night, before burying their equipment each morning. “We know there are still places where they’re resisting … [We can’t say] illegal mining’s completely finished and everything’s fine. We know there’s still work to be done,” Tubino said.Even so, Lula’s anti-mining representative thought major progress had been made, citing reports from Yanomami leaders that villagers were now swimming and fishing in previously polluted rivers. Tubino said the challenge, as the operation entered its “maintenance” phase, was to ensure a permanent government presence that would stop another large-scale mining invasion and help Yanomami communities rebuild.Activists and health workers fretted what may happen if Lula lost Brazil’s next presidential election, in 2026, and Bolsonaro or someone similar won power. “This is a big risk and we’re very worried,” Hekurari said.View image in fullscreenMarcos Kaingang, 30, secretary for the protection of territorial rights from the ministry for Indigenous Peoples, visiting the Surucucu region two years after the start of the humanitarian crisis.Photograph: João Laet/The GuardianMarcos Kaingang, the secretary for the protection of territorial rights at Lula’s ministry forIndigenous peoples, recalled the harrowing scenes he saw after landing in Kori Yauopë in January 2023, on the eve of the government’s Yanomami campaign. “It was no different to the concentration camps you see in pictures from the Nazi period,” he said of the malnourished toddlers he encountered – not all of whom survived.Two years later, the mood was dramatically different, as Kaingang stood on the same runway watching healthy-looking Yanomami children play football and helicopters soar overhead, carrying aid parcels and medics to even more isolated areas.Inside the communal hut, elders took turns to announce news from their areas during what – because mining-related violence had made travelling through the territory hard – was one of their first major assemblies in years.View image in fullscreenMonica Yanomami from Haxiu speaks to The Guardian during a meeting of villagers in a remote community called Kori Yauopë.Photograph: João Laet/The Guardian“We suffered so much.

But Margret Chola, in her mid 80s, has become an internet sensation and accidental fashion icon after she agreed to swap clothes with her New York-based stylist granddaughter, Diana Kaumba.Photos of Chola dressed in a red Adidas tracksuit, and wearing strappy high heels paired with blue Adidas socks and gloves, chunky sunglasses, gold chains and a crown first went viral when Kaumba posted them on herInstagramaccount in April last year.“There was something about that image that made me post it,” says Kaumba. “I love it, but I was so scared that people would judge me because I had put so many chains on my grandma. [But] I went away for 10 minutes, came back and there were about 2,000 likes and more than 200 comments.View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreen“People were like, ‘Oh my God, who is this? This is what we needed.’”A few days later, Kaumba set up an Instagram account for her grandmother, orMbuyain the Bemba language, titledLegendary Glamma. It has more than 140,000 followers including singer Rihanna, the actor Jennifer Hudson, and the actor and film producer Viola Davis. Chola’s image has featured on the cover of magazines,on the BBCand in other media outlets, is printed on T-shirts, and Kaumba has appeared on TV talkshows.Getting creative: African YouTubers and TikTokers search for ways to make it payRead moreKaumba, who spends her time between the US and Zambia, hires a small team, which includes her nephew, to help her style and shoot Chola. She posts a new picture of her grandmother in a different outfit every other week as part of her granny series.The Zambian response was not positive at first. Then they started sharing it and it blew up. Now, everybody is embracing herDiana KaumbaSo far, Chola has posed in silver platform shoes; baggy jeans with a T-shirt emblazoned with her photo; black biker boots; a green American football jersey with a layered frilly red dress styled as a skirt in the colours of the Zambian flag; and more, always paired with an assortment of accessories.View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenIn the background of the photos are scenes from the family farm in the village of Mungule, just north of the Zambian capital, Lusaka.Kaumba, 42, inherited a love of fashion from her father, a diplomat. When he got a job in New York, she was 20 and moved with him. There, she was exposed to glossy fashion magazines, which served as further inspiration.For the past three years, she has been travelling back and forth to Zambia, where she has a showroom and has styled local celebrities, such as Mutale Mwanza, a socialite with her own reality show, and the musician Chile One Mr Zambia. It was when she was in the country to mark the anniversary of her father’s death in March 2023, that she first had the idea to style her grandmother. She posted a couple of photos on Instagram, but it wasn’t until she featured different ones a year later, that there was a huge reaction.View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenWhile people outside Zambia celebrated Chola and were clamouring for more, the reaction in the southern African country was more critical. “The Zambian response was not positive at first,” remembers Kaumba. “People really judged me and they were laughing at me in Zambia. They asked, ‘Why would you do that [to your grandmother]? Why can’t you just leave her alone?’”International interest, including an appearance on a US talkshow and on the BBC, changed that perception. “People in Zambia were like, ‘Oh my God, so this is actually a good thing.’ Then they started sharing it and it blew up in Zambia. Now, everybody is embracing her.”View image in fullscreenThe series has changed people’s perception of ageing. In Zambia, as in other countries, older people are often overlooked and maligned; and society dictates they should dress a certain way. Kaumba, who creditsIris Apfel, a renowned New York designer and style icon who found fame in her 80s, as a major inspiration for the granny series, has received messages saying her grandmother is bold and inspiring. Women in their 60s have explained that the photos have made them feel as if they can live again, and people have sent pictures of their own grandparents.View image in fullscreenChola’s view of herself has also changed. “She told me it has given her a second chance at life,” says Kaumba (pictured with Chola, left). “She has something to look forward to because, before, she would wake up with different pains and just talk about that. Now, you see this whole different kind of energy.”This means a lot to Kaumba, who says Chola, who was not available to speak to the Guardian, has had a difficult life. She was raised by her grandparents, went to school until she was 12 and then for economic reasons was forced to marry a man in his 30s.She gave birth to six children, started drinking heavily and eventually escaped the marriage. When Chola talks about it now, she becomes teary because of the trauma she went through. She had another son, but he died, aged 16. She now lives with Kaumba’s mother and has become the sole focus of Kaumba’s work when she goes back to Zambia.“People are glued to the granny series because Grandma’s looks are unpredictable,” says Kaumba. “Today, she’s wearing chains and a crown; tomorrow she’s wearing a suit with a tie. This is what has kept the interest for people. They can’t wait to see what she’s going to show up in next.”View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenExplore more on these topicsZambiaOlder peopleInstagramAfricafeaturesShareReuse this content"

Some are sceptical given the lack of blockbuster results at the LHC since the landmark discovery of the Higgs boson in 2012 and Germany hasdescribed the $17bn proposal as unaffordable. But Thomson said AI has provided fresh impetus to the hunt for new physics at the subatomic scale – and that major discoveries could occur after 2030 when a major upgrade will boost theLHC’s beam intensity by a factor of ten.This will allow unprecedented observations of the Higgs boson, nicknamed the God particle, that grants mass to other particles and binds the universe together.“There’s a particular measurement about the Higgs boson that is so fundamental to the nature of the universe,” said Thomson. “What we will be looking at is producing not one Higgs boson but two Higgs bosons at the same time.”This, he said, will allow scientists to measure how the Higgs particle gives mass to itself for the first time – a phenomenon called Higgs self-coupling.Two Higgs bosons appear at once so rarely and the particles are so elusive – disintegrating into more familiar particles as soon as they come into existence – that five years ago Thomson said he would have assumed this was beyond the LHC’s capabilities. “Now I’m confident we are going to make a good measurement,” said Thomson.The strength of Higgs self-coupling is crucial for understanding how, a trillionth of a second after the big bang, a change in the Higgs field resulted in particles suddenly acquiring mass. It could also reveal whether the Higgs field has reached a final, stable resting state or whether another drastic transition could occur in future, a scenario that would see the universe as we know it evaporate almost instantaneously. The Standard Model of physics suggests that this is a possibility – but there is no need for alarm.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

On the other hand, it’s a scientific question – could this happen?”According to Thomson: “It’s a very deep fundamental property of the universe, one we don’t fully understand. If we saw the Higgs self-coupling being different from our current theory, that that would be another massive, massive discovery. And you don’t know until you’ve made the measurement.”AI is being injected into every aspect of the LHC operation, from deciding which data to collect to how it should be interpreted. “When the LHC is colliding protons, it’s making around 40m collisions a second and we have to make a decision within a microsecond … which events are something interesting that we want to keep and which to throw away,” said Dr Katharine Leney, who works on the LHC’s Atlas experiment. “We’re already now doing better with the data that we’ve collected than we thought we’d be able to do with 20 times more data ten years ago. So we’ve advanced by 20 years at least. A huge part of this has been down to AI.”Scientists have long hoped the LHC might be capable of producing dark matter, a substance that is believed to make up a large fraction of the universe. But given that the nature of dark matter is entirely unknown, searching for it is a challenging task. Generative AI could help prise this puzzle apart, according to Thomson. “You can start to ask more complex, open-ended questions,” he said. “Rather than searching for a particular signature, you ask the question: ‘Is there something unexpected in this data?’”Explore more on these topicsLarge Hadron ColliderParticle physicsPhysicsArtificial intelligence (AI)newsShareReuse this content"

It is a crisp and sunny winter morning when I visit and, at first glance, the site appears to be little more than prefab containers and a car park. Yet, behind the scenes a group of men and women with expertise in diving, marine biology, technology, finance, construction and manufacturing are building something extraordinary. They have come together with a single mission statement: to make humans aquatic.Their project is called Deep (not The Deep) and the site was chosen after a global search for the perfect location to build and test underwater accommodation, which the project founders say will enable them to establish a “permanent human presence” under the sea from 2027.So far, so crazy sounding. Yet Deep is funded by a single anonymous private investor with deep pockets who wants to put hundreds of millions of pounds (if not more) into a project that will “increase understanding of the ocean and its critical role for humanity”, according to a Deep spokesperson. Its leadership team remains tight-lipped not only about the amount (they will only say it is substantially more than the £100m being invested into the Deep campus near Chepstow), but also about the investor’s identity. Whoever is behind it, the size of the investment means that an ambitious-sounding idea appears to be swiftly becoming a reality.View image in fullscreenPhil Short, research diving and training lead at Deep, outside the full-scale replica of the subsea sentinel habitat under construction at a site on the Welsh border. Photograph: Mark Griffiths/the ObserverThe 20-hectare (50-acre) site in Gloucestershire was once a limestone quarry that was flooded in the 1990s and used by a dive school until 2022. Now,it is being transformedinto a state-of-the-art facility that will feature accommodation units, a training school and a platform for mini submersibles to take people down to living spaces in the 80-metre deep (260ft) lake. These underwater units, known as sentinels, will then be used to train scientists – and eventually anyone else who has the money to rent them – to live under the ocean for much longer than has ever been achieved before, and at a greater depth.The goal is to live in the ocean, for ever. To have permanent human settlements in all oceans across the worldMike Shackleford, chief operating officer, DeepThe units can be lowered to 200 metres (656ft) under the sea, which is where the sunlight zone ends and the twilight zone of the ocean begins. Marine life found at that depth includes thekind of creaturesmost people will only ever see via David Attenborough documentaries and is a place about which we still know very little.Mike Shackleford, Deep’s chief operating officer, explains the thought process behind the project. “Back in the 1950s and 60s, there was a space race and an ocean race going on, and space won out. Space is tough to get to, but once you’re up there, it’s a relatively benign environment.” The ocean is the opposite: it’s fairly easy to get to the bottom, but once you’re down there, “basically, everything wants to kill you”, he jokes.“Yet, just about every oceanographer I’ve met says, ‘You’d be shocked at how little we know about the ocean’,” Shackleford tells me. “So somebody has got to take those first steps to try to build some of the technology that will allow us to go down and study the ocean in situ.”The idea of Deep’s sentinels is that, initially, people will be able to stay inside for up to 28 days at a time – though the hope is that this could one day be extended to months … and beyond. “The goal is to live in the ocean, for ever. To have permanent human settlements in all oceans across the world,” says Shackleford.View image in fullscreenJacques Cousteau led a group of ‘aquanauts’ in an underwater habitat in the Red Sea in 1963, proving that such expeditions were possible. Photograph: Robert B Goodman/National Geographic CreativeThere have been previous attempts to establish living quarters in the sea. Jacques Cousteau pioneered underwater living in the 1960s,starting with the Continental Shelf (or Conshelf) I, a five-metre long, 2.5-metre wide steel cylinder that was set up off Marseille at a depth of 10 metres. Cousteau went on to develop more sophisticated versions of Conshelf I at locations around the world – funded in part by the French petrochemical industry.Cousteau eventually abandoned it for a career focused on conservation but underwater habitats remained popular for some time after, inspiring all sorts of experiments, including one by two British teenagers who lived underwater for a week off the coast of Plymouth in a steel tankthey had built themselves. The craze to conquer life under the ocean then “dropped off in the 80s”, says Shackleford. “Humanity kind of walked away and went towards outer space.”View image in fullscreenNasa’s Aquarius Reef Base in the Atlantic Ocean in the Florida Keys national marine sanctuary, built in 1986, is still in use.

Now run by Florida International University, it was built in the 1980s and is the only underwater human habitation still used today, including for the training of Nasa astronauts as part of the space agency’s Extreme Environment Mission Operations’s (Neemo) programme.Back in Gloucestershire we pile into a Land Rover to begin the bumpy ascent up the track that loops round the lake where, as we near the clearing at the top, we are greeted by shouting, banging and the sound of electric drills. Everything being made by Deep is being constructed either on site or down the road at an industrial unit in Bristol, including the lifesize wooden mock-up of the sentinel that we are driving to see.View image in fullscreen‘The perfect location to build and test underwater accommodation’: Deep’s site at a quarry lake in Gloucestershire.

Photographs: Mark Griffiths/the ObserverStanding outside the full-size underwater house gives an instant idea of the incredible scale of the undertaking. The main recreational area is a six-metre diameter hemisphere, and the porthole windows mean that when the real thing is submerged there will be an inescapable feeling of being surrounded by the ocean and its inhabitants.Short estimates it will take anywhere between a year and 18 months to get someone who has never dived before fully capable of running an ocean deployed sentinel systemUpstairs is a kitchen and an area that can be adapted to scientific study. The six bedrooms are roomy and there is a fully fitted bathroom with running water and a flush toilet. The whole thing is constructed from a type of steel specially developed to withstand the pressure at 200 metres.Although no one working on deep-sea submersibles wants to dwell too much on the Titan tragedy – the deep-sea submersiblethat imploded off the coast of Newfoundland, Canada,in 2023 killing all five people on board – Phil Short, research diving and training lead at Deep, is not surprised it’s a subject that keeps coming up. One of his primary concerns is to underline strongly the difference between this project and that of the Titan.Deep’s engineers have been working with Det Norske Veritas (DNV), a classification and safety agency, to ensure it is fully tested and certified all the way through the design and manufacturing process. “DNV are approving every potential design, manufacture and testing capability of our systems from day one,” Short says. “So, when we finally get this built and we’re about to drop it in the water, it will be fully certified in class.”View image in fullscreenThe two-person mini submersible is prepared for deployment at the edge of the lake. Photograph: Richard Varcoe/DeepClassing is like an MOT on a car, he says: “No one reading this would think of putting their children, their partner, their family dog, in a homemade car with no test, unknown brakes, unknown gearbox, unknown engine and homemade tyres.” They would, he says, choose something based on how well it will protect those people.The equipment might be certified, but what about the people who will be using it? It will be a huge task to physically and mentally train those without any experience for life under the water. Even looking at the two-person mini submersible they have waiting for deployment at the edge of the quarry lake, I think, could I really trust it to take me a few metres below the surface of a lake, let alone convince myself to travel hundreds of metres under the sea?Research into the effects of saturation diving on the body in the 1970s and 90s tended to be on young, fit men. To revisit that work with a wider variety of people is going to enable better scienceThe philosophy behind how successfully an individual will cope, says Short, is much the same as that for training soldiers: you can do as much basic training as possible but until you’re in a firefight you don’t know how you’re going to respond. However, the advantage of having a simulator that pretty much exactly replicates life underwater, means Deep’s dive-training team are better able to put people through their paces.“We can basically cover that psychological aspect of: how do you feel being stuck in an environment about the size of a small family home with five other people for 28 days? We can trial that thoroughly,” says Short. He estimates it will take anywhere between a year and 18 months to get someone who has never dived before fully capable of running an ocean deployed sentinel system.Dawn Kernagis is director of scientific research for Deep. We meet in London, at the end of a trip she has taken from her base in the US to see how progress is coming along at Deep campus. Kernagis was a crew member with the Nasa Neemo mission that lived aboard the Aquarius Reef Base and so has rare first-hand experience of living underwater.“I can still visualise what it was like to wake up in the morning there,” she says. “We had the window just next to the bed and so you would open your eyes and see fish, stingrays and sharks swimming by. Being able to watch those interactions was just so key. Because, you know, we weren’t disturbing their environment, they were just doing their thing and it’s really cool to have the capability to observe that.”View image in fullscreenMini submersibles will take people down to living spaces in the 80m deep (260ft) lake. Photograph: Richard Varcoe/DeepDeep will offer the same experience but with more sophisticated accommodation, at greater depths, and allow scientists to work at those depths for greater periods of time. Their sentinels will also be able to be redeployed to different places. The idea is that a foundation construction will be attached in the desired location at the required depth and then the sentinels will be lowered down to click into the base like “a ski boot being locked into a ski”, Kernagis says. The basic sentinel houses up to six people but the idea is that multiple sentinels could be attached to potentially form multi-nation, multi-purpose research stations (or perhaps, one day, an underwater village for ordinary people).In the past, a lot of the early underwater habitats were meant to be redeployable, but it was difficult to do that, so they would be put down in one place and stay there for years. “You’re restricting what marine science you can do if you can only do it from one place,” Kernagis says.View image in fullscreenThe sentinels will include a kitchen, study area, six bedrooms and fully fitted bathroomKernagis, who has a background in human physiology, is excited about being given the ability to learn more about the human body and what living at depth does to it. Much research into the effects of saturation diving on the human body was done in the 1970s and early 1990s but it tended to be on young, physically fit men, she says. The ability to revisit some of that work with a wider variety of people and to do it in situ, rather than potentially compromising samples by bringing them to the surface, is going to enable better science.What lies beneath: our love affair with living underwaterRead moreKernagis thinks the relative comfort of the accommodation provided by Deep will help anyone using it. Aquarius, for example, used a bunk-bed system with six people sleeping in one tiny space. “Living under pressure like that, some people tended to snore louder than normal,” she says, “so we tended not to sleep as well.” Then there were the questionable bathroom facilities. “We had a toilet that was actually part of the shower and was in the moon-pool area, which is where you go in and out for your dives. And so everything was just a curtain that you pulled. And that was it.”Deep’s toilets, a spokesperson assures me, have been through “extensive human factors assessments to ensure that they are as comfortable as possible”.Across the River Severn from Gloucestershire in a commercial kitchen in Avonmouth, Bristol, chef Joe Costa is trimming carrots to use in the main course of an experimental dish. An underwater menu is one of the final, but crucial, pieces of the puzzle that Deep is working on to make life under the sea the best it can be.They say an army marches on its stomach, so quantity, quality, taste and ease of digestion are all massive factors to make these missions successfulJoe Costa, chef“The first hurdle was the challenge of actually being able to taste anything at depth because your tastebuds are suppressed by the pressure change,” says Costa, a classically trained chef and a diver.He is focusing on using strong flavours that will be delivered in vacuum packs. His initial menu sounds mouth-watering and he makes it more tantalising by describing it like he is presenting it on an episode of MasterChef.“We start with a french onion soup, with nice cheese croutons on the top, and then we have slow roast, short-rib beef that has been marinated for a week in a sous vide (vacuum-sealed bag) in a really heavy red wine sauce. That is served with a truffle polenta with ricotta and then, to finish, a double sticky toffee pudding, which is spiced with extra cinnamon, all spice, and star anise.”View image in fullscreenPorthole windows mean those within will be surrounded by ocean life.

Photographs: Joe Costa; Mark Griffiths/the ObserverIf this sounds hugely calorific, it’s because it is. Phil Short, who at 56 boasts an impressively skinny frame, explains that as soon as anyone gets in the water, even if it’s warm, they start losing heat rapidly and their lungs have to work harder against the pressure of the water. This raises the body’s metabolism significantly, and that’s before any physical exertion has taken place. “I’ve spent my whole life in the water and I eat and eat and still lose weight,” he says.A lot of the food Costa is preparing tastes too strong above the water. The beef in the sauce was wonderfully tender but “hard to palate” he says. Yet at depth it should hit people’s tastebuds in just the right way. And he’s thought of every detail to make a culinary underwater experience the best it can be. “We are thinking about doing sous vide cheese snacks as an appetiser so that when the divers come into the sentinel, they get their wet gear off and get changed and can have a little cheese board before they start their meal.” All that’s missing, it seems, is a glass of red wine.Once Costa has created the menus they will go to a nutritionist to assess them for the required levels of vitamins and minerals and finally they will be tested under pressure in a laboratory in a diver research centre in Plymouth. Short is unapologetic about the apparent extravagance of the food on offer. “They say an army marches on its stomach, so quantity, quality, taste and also ease of digestion are all massive factors to make these missions successful,” he says. “And, more importantly, for the type of people we want to put in these habitats it makes meals enjoyable, rather than just miserable.”View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenDeep’s engineers are working to fully test and certify the structure through each stage of the design and manufacturing process. Photograph: Mark Griffiths/the ObserverEverything about Deep – the Gloucestershire campus, the size and scale of the underwater accommodation, the food and the anticipated clientele – appears to be pushing the boundaries of what has gone before. But one thing remains constant, and that is what is waiting in the watery world below for those who brave life in the underwater housing.“There are going to be things down there that we won’t even know to ask questions about before we descend, because we don’t know yet that they exist,” says Kernagis.This potential is what makes work under the ocean so exciting for her. She recalls her time towards the end of the mission on the Aquatic Reef Base when she made an excursion with a colleague in one of the submersibles outside the main habitat.“We were wrapping up some of our sample collections and I made the comment to her that I couldn’t imagine life back on Earth. And she turned to look at me and said, ‘We are on Earth’. But for me it was like I was in this whole other world.”Explore more on these topicsSeascape: the state of our oceansMarine lifeOceansfeaturesShareReuse this content"

At the weekend, the Trump administration removed two security officials from USAid who had tried to stop representatives from his department of government efficiency from gaining access to the building.Ramaphosa signed a bill last month allowing the South African government to offer “nil compensation” in certain circumstances for land it expropriates in the public interest. This includes if the land is abandoned or held purely for speculation, if offering no compensation is “just and equitable”.How the roots of the ‘PayPal mafia’ extend to apartheid South AfricaRead more“South Africa is confiscating land, and treating certain classes of people VERY BADLY,” Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform on Sunday. “I will be cutting off all future funding to South Africa until a full investigation of this situation has been completed!”In response, Ramaphosa said its law was not exceptional and that the only US aid South Africa received was 17% of its HIV/Aids programme.“The recently adopted Expropriation Act is not a confiscation instrument, but a constitutionally mandated legal process that ensures public access to land in an equitable and just manner as guided by the constitution,” Ramaphosa said in apost on X. “South Africa, like the United States of America and other countries, has always had expropriation laws that balance the need for public usage of land and the protection of rights of property owners.”The US federal government can take over private property if “just compensation” is offered.Ramaphosa’s African National Congress party has previously argued that the bill, which was passed by the previous ANC-led parliament, is not arbitrary as the government must first seek agreement with the owner.However, some groups have warned it could lead to a situation like the Zimbabwe government’s seizure of white-owned commercial farms, often without compensation, after independence in 1980.View image in fullscreenThe president of South Africa, Cyril Ramaphosa, signed a bill last month allowing the government to offer ‘nil compensation’ in certain circumstances for land it expropriates in the public interest.Photograph: Munashe Chokodza/EPAThe issue has divided South Africa’s coalition government, with the white-led, pro-business Democratic Alliance launching a formal dispute over it. The Zulu-dominated Inkatha Freedom party has raised concerns that it could undermine the Zulu monarchy’s extensive land ownership.Later, in a media briefing, Trump said, without providing examples, that South Africa’s “leadership is doing some terrible things, horrible things”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst ThingFree daily newsletterOur US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We’ll make a determination, and until such time as we find out what South Africa is doing – they’re taking away land and confiscating land, and actually they’re doing things that are perhaps far worse than that,” he said.South Africa’s foreign ministry said in a statement: “We trust President Trump’s advisers will make use of the investigative period to attain a thorough understanding of South Africa’s policies within the framework of a constitutional democracy.”Thousands of Black families were forcibly removed from their land by the apartheid regime under the 1913 Natives Land Act. Since the end of apartheid, courts have ruled on a handful of lengthy land disputes, returning land to previously displaced owners.The government has also bought and redistributed 7.8m hectares (19m acres) of farmland, with its target to redistribute 30% of white farms moved repeatedly from 1998 until 2030.Black farmers have bought another 1.8m hectares of land, according to the Stellenbosch University economistsJohann Kirsten and Wandile Sihlobo. However, 78% of private farms remain white-owned, while many Black farmers have struggled amid a lack of financial and technical support.The right has used murders of white South African farmers as arallying point, including the British rightwing journalist Katie Hopkins and Musk, who was born in Pretoria in 1971 but left the country in his late teens.Trump has surrounded himself with powerful Silicon Valley figures who came of age in apartheid southern Africa, including David Sacks, hisartificial intelligence and cryptocurrency tsar, who co-founded PayPal with Musk.The billionaire Peter Thiel – another PayPal cofounder, who introduced Trump to his vice-president, JD Vance – also lived in southern Africa, including in Namibia which was then ruled by South Africa.

Officially known as the Nanna Living History Museum, the building was designated a national monument in 1990.“[It] is the only living history museum among the 52 museums under the supervision of the national commission for museums and monuments,” said Henry Erikowa, who was the museum’s secretary when it first opened in the 1970s and now serves as chair of its advisory board.The exterior looks well preserved and has a recent coating of Nigeria’s green and white colours, thanks to a 2022 renovation. But the inside betrays underfunding: there is no public toilet or cooling system for the artefacts, which include items gifted to Olomu by colonial administrators. Termite infestation is also an issue in one of the wings. When the Guardian visited, there was no electricity so the room where his tomb lies had to be illuminated by torchlight.View image in fullscreenThe courtyard of the Nanna Living History Museum.Photograph: Eromo Egbejule/The GuardianAbout 60 miles (100km) away in Benin City is the shiny new campus-styleMuseum of West African Art, which opened last November. When complete, it will hold dozens of bronzes that have been in European museums since they were looted by British troops in 1897. It is one of several local museums being built orrenovatedas the global debate over reparation and restitution for colonial-era crimes continues.Some hope the wave extends to Koko, where things are bleak.“The federal government is trying, but they are far away,” said Ibrahim Kadiri, a museum education officer. “Most of the time when we want a little money to do one or two things, we have to start begging.”At its peak, the ancient Benin empire traded with the Portuguese and British on the adjoining Gulf of Guinea. After the Berlin partition and the accompanying scramble forAfrica, Britain was eager to exert more control on west African trade.“The British always have their own interests and … their interests supersedes every other interest,” said Kadiri. “They already knew what they wanted to do in Africa.”Olomu, an oil palm magnate and middleman for both empires, was also chief of the Itsekiri, a minority ethnic group, with links to their neighbours in the Benin empire and the Portuguese, midway into an interregnum that eventually lasted 88 years.Today, dozens of cattle, descendants of Olomu’s herd, roam Koko, which got its name from his massive cocoyam farm. His wealth and weapons consolidated his authority, irking the British, who claimed he was obstructing free trade.View image in fullscreenThe courtyard of the Nanna Living History Museum.Photograph: Eromo Egbejule/The GuardianThree years before the well-known invasion of Benin, the British in 1894 launched a lesser-heralded punitive expedition in Ebrohimi, the capital of Olumu’s trade. The incident made Nigerian and British newspapers at the time.“They [British] brought four warships from South Africa and they were bombarding Ebrohimi from afar, indiscriminately,” said Kadiri. “The rules of engagement were not applied.”The British put a bounty of £500 (about £77,000-£80,000 today) on Olomu when he escaped during the invasion. After his capture and trial, some of his possessions and armoury were auctioned off to pay for naval expenses. Others including flags, guns and swords were taken to London.When Allegra Ayida, an Itsekiri historian and doctoral candidate in history at Yale University, recently saw some of the items in storage and on display at the National Maritime Museum in London, she was proud of their “international visibility” but resented having to “travel thousands of miles to view these objects”.“As an Itsekiri historian, I am intimately aware of the violence of their removal during colonial expeditions,” added Ayida, a descendant of Olomu. “These objects … so rich in history and significance, are disconnected from the community that created them.”View image in fullscreenOlomu’s throne and royal umbrella during his time as governor.Photograph: Eromo Egbejule/The GuardianThe Koko museum’s board said discussions were ongoing about the possibility of getting artefacts back from the UK. “[We have] to continue pressing for the return of our properties,” said Erikowa, who is also custodian of the Itsekiri royal cemetery in Ijala-Warri.Experts such as Ayida say the discourse on reparation needs to extend beyond the “general oversimplification of British colonial history in west Africa that tends to focus on Benin” to include other overlooked groups, and foster healing of historical wounds everywhere.On the other side of the debate are those who say artefacts should be left abroad until the country’s museums are better equipped to hold them. Many of the Itsekiris say that line of reasoning prevents communities in former colonies from owning and telling their stories.“I believe this argument is too often used to stall meaningful restitution … instead, restitution efforts should be coupled with support for capacity-building in local institutions” said Ayida. “It is a disservice to history and justice to assume that these items are better kept abroad, as such views perpetuate colonial-era paternalism.”Explore more on these topicsNigeriaAfricaHeritageColonialismnewsShareReuse this content"

China is still set to face additional 10% levy on its exports to the US from Tuesday.Following talks with the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, and the Mexican president,Claudia Sheinbaum, on Monday, Trump agreed at the last minuteto hold off from imposing new duties on the two countries.The agreements came on a day of extreme volatility in global financial markets as rattled investors reacted to the prospect of a dramatically escalating dispute involving the world’s largest economies.The US president had upended US-Mexico ties over the weekend when he announced 25% tariffs and accused Sheinbaum’s administration of engaging in an “intolerable alliance” with Mexican crime groups.Sheinbaum rejected that “slanderous” accusation, but on Monday morning struck a softer note as she announced “a series of agreements” with Trump after a conversation between the two leaders during which they agreed to pause US tariffs for a month to allow for fresh negotiations.Mexico had agreed to send 10,000 members of its national guard “to prevent drug trafficking from Mexico to the US, in particular of fentanyl”, Sheinbaum said. In return, the US had agreed to work to prevent high-powered weapons crossing the border into Mexico.Mitch McConnell calls Trump tariffs ‘bad idea’ but most Republicans toe lineRead moreTrump confirmed the deal shortly afterwards on his Truth Social network. He said 10,000 Mexican soldiers would be “specifically designated to stop the flow of fentanyl, and illegal migrants into our country”.Negotiations involving senior Mexican officials, the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, the US treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, and the US commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick, would take place during the pause, he said.Following two calls with Trump on Monday, Trudeau announced that tariffs would be “paused” for 30 days. “Canada is implementing our $1.3bn border plan – reinforcing the border with new choppers, technology and personnel, enhanced coordination with our American partners, and increased resources to stop the flow of fentanyl,” he said in a statement. “Nearly 10,000 frontline personnel are and will be working on protecting the border.”Trump wrote on Truth Social: “As President, it is my responsibility to ensure the safety of ALL Americans, and I am doing just that. I am very pleased with this initial outcome, and the Tariffs announced on Saturday will be paused for a 30 day period to see whether or not a final Economic deal with Canada can be structured. FAIRNESS FOR ALL!”Late last year, Trump threatened to impose tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China on the first day of his presidency. From the first day of his presidency, he said he would do so from 1 February. This weekend, he said they would kick in from 4 February. They have now been delayed until March.Economists have warned Trump’s planned wave of tariffs would risk raising prices for millions of Americans, just weeks after he pledged, upon taking office, to “rapidly” bring them down.On Monday, however, Trump maintained that tariffs were a “very powerful” means of both strengthening the US economically and “getting everything else you want”. He had conceded over the weekend that they could cause “a little pain” in the US.Markets sold off sharply worldwide in response to what has been described as a “Trump tariff tantrum” before recovering some of their losses after news broke of the deal with Mexico. Wall Street fell in early trading, with the S&P 500 down almost 2%. Share prices in Europe followed a sharp move lower in Asia.London’s FTSE 100 index dropped 1.4% from Friday’s record high before making back some of its losses to trade down 1%.Trump also indicated on Sunday that the EU would be next to face tariffs, but did not say when.EU leaders meeting at an informal summit in Brussels on Monday said Europe would fight back if the US imposed tariffs, but called for negotiation. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, said that if the bloc’s commercial interests were attacked it would “make itself respected and thus react”.The German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, said the EU could respond if necessary with its own tariffs, but stressed it would be better for the two sides to find agreement on trade.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst ThingFree daily newsletterOur US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I know that intense US-EU discussions are planned.”Officials, analysts and economists who believe Trump’s tariffs could have disastrous consequences for the global economy and for Washinton’s place in the world voiced relief at the Mexico deal.Experts believe Trump’s plans for 10% tariffs on China and 25% on Canada and Mexico would hamper global growth and cause inflation in the US. Even Trump admitted on Sunday that the measures might cause “a little pain”.Brian Winter, the editor-in-chief ofAmericasQuarterly magazine and a Latin America expert, said: “I don’t think anyone expected a resolution today, and obviously it’s a relief. But the damage is done.“I can personally imagine a scenario where, within a year, President Trump is on buddy-buddy terms again with Mexico. But you cannot unsee what happened over the last 48 hours. And if companies make decisions in terms of years and decades, how they think about Mexico specifically, and its place in the US value chain, is forever changed.”Speaking at her daily press conference in Mexico City, Sheinbaum told reporters that at the end of a 30- to 45-minute conversation with Trump, she had joked with him that she would like to see tariffs suspended forever. She said she believed a one-month reprieve represented a good deal, however, and painted the agreement as a win for both sides.“In Mexico we have rocket launchers that come from the US illegally … How can these high-powered weapons get into Mexico from the US?” she asked, hailing Trump’s apparent commitment to fight gun smuggling as part of the agreement.Winter said he believed that in some ways Trump’s strong-arm tactics appeared to be working.​Four of his opening moves on the world stage have come in Latin America: diplomatic tussles with Colombia and Venezuela over the deportation of migrants; with Mexico over drug trafficking and migration; and with Panama over supposed Chinese involvement in the Panama canal. In all four cases, Trump has managed to claim victory or extract concessions, although critics argue many of those are largely cosmetic and designed to achieve little more than to please his base.Winter said: “There’s no doubt that Trump’s approach has produced tangible short-term results in Latin America, decisions that were made with a scope and timeline that otherwise would not have been possible … I think you have to acknowledge​ that each of these governments have moved far more quickly to accommodate Washington than they would have under a more traditional request.“The question is, though: what does this do to Washington’s alliances in the medium term? Does it push these countries closer to China? I have my doubts … but with all of these crises, scars remain. I think that governments understand that this is an even more transactional government than in Donald Trump’s first term, and that they can’t really think in terms of alliances anymore with the United States. That’s a huge change.​”Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationClaudia SheinbaumMexicoDonald TrumpUS foreign policyInternational tradeDrugs tradenewsShareReuse this content"

Ontario won’t do business with people hellbent on destroying our economy,” Doug Ford, the premier, said in apost on X.Ford warned that US businesses will lose out on “tens of billions of dollars” in new revenues as a result of Ontario’sresponse to the tariffs. The deal between Ford and Starlink was reported to be worth C$100m (US$68.5m).“They only have President Trump to blame,” Ford said, adding that the Canadian government will also ban US companies from provincial contracts until the tariffs are removed.Trump tariffs: which countries are affected and what does this mean?Read moreFord’s announcement follows other retaliatory moves taken by Canadian leaders after Trumpdeclared a tariff barrageagainst Canada, Mexico and China on Saturday, saying he would order 25% tariffs on goods coming into the US from Canada and Mexico, and 10% on imports from China.Both Canada and Mexico ordered retaliatory tariffs on American goods in response to Trump.Musk, now an adviser to Trump, is overseeing the US “department of government efficiency” (Doge) in cooperation with theTrump administration.It was reported by Infrastructure Ontario in January last year that only two satellite internet service providers were capable of meeting the coverage needs of Ontario – Musk’sSpaceX, which runs Starlink, and Xplore Inc, a rural Canadian service.

Jason Smith, chair of the ways and means committee of the House of Representatives,saidthe tariffs would “send a powerful message that the United States will no longer stand by as other nations fail to halt the flow of illegal drugs and immigrants into our country”.Trump tariffs: which countries are affected and what does this mean?Read moreHe added: “On top of these crises, our neighbours continue to take advantage of American workers, manufacturers, and farmers, including Canada’s refusal to allow real access to its dairy market and Mexico’s unjustified barriers to US corn.”Byron Donalds, a Republican representative from Florida, said risks that the tariffs would fuel inflation – a key concern among voters that contributed to Trump’s election victory – were “worth it”.Eric Schmitt, a Republican senator from Missouri, alsotold NBC’s Meet the Pressthat they “are meant to bring Canada and Mexico to the table for the fentanyl that is streaming into our communities”.That rationale was dismissed by Chrystia Freeland, the former Canadian finance minister who is running for the leadership of the governing Liberal party. Freeland told MSNBC’s Morning Joe programme that the Canadian border accounted for just 0.2% of fentanyl entering the US and that the issue could be solved “in five minutes”.Another Trump ally, the South Carolina senator Lindsey Graham, offered more qualified support, telling Fox News: “I think the tariffs probably go away” if they succeed in getting “these countries to change their behaviour”.Ontario premier ‘ripping up’ contract with Musk’s Starlink over US tariffsRead moreThe Tax Foundation, a non-partisan thinktank, has estimated that the tariffs would be equal to an $830 tax increase on the average household.One of the few exceptions to the chorus of support for Trump’s trade war was McConnell, who has often clashed with the president. “It will drive the cost of everything up. In other words, it will be paid for by American consumers. I mean, why would you want to get into a fight with your allies over this?” hetoldCBS’s 60 Minutes programme.Two other Republican senators, Susan Collins of Maine and Rand Paul of Kentucky, have voiced doubts, with Paulcalling tariffs“simply taxes”.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationDonald TrumpUS politicsMitch McConnellRepublicansMexicoCanadanewsShareReuse this content"

Mexico and Canada have vowed levies of their own while China and Canada are seeking legal challenges.Trump said on Sunday night that new tariffs on the EU would “definitely happen”, repeating previous complaints about the large US trade deficit with the bloc and his desire for Europe to import more American cars and agricultural products.Asian sharemarkets tumble in response to Trump tariffsRead more“It will definitely happen with the European Union, I can tell you that,” he told reporters. “I wouldn’t say there’s a timeline but it’s going to be pretty soon.”Trump appeared to take a softer line on the UK, citing a good relationship with the prime minister, Keir Starmer, while saying tariffs still “might happen”. “The UK is out of line but I’m sure that one, I think that one can be worked out,” he said. “Well Prime Minister Starmer’s been very nice, we’ve had a couple of meetings, we’ve had numerous phone calls, we’re getting along very well, we’ll see whether or not we can balance out our budget.”Before Trump’s latest threat to the EU, a spokesperson for the European Commission said on Sunday that the union would “respond firmly to any trading partner that unfairly or arbitrarily imposes tariffs on EU goods”. The EU responded to previous Trump tariffs byimposing duties on emblematic American goodsmade in Republican-leaning states, such as Harley-Davidson motorbikes, bourbon and orange juice.The commission said it regretted Trump’s decision to impose tariffs onCanada, Mexico and China: “Tariffs create unnecessary economic disruption and drive inflation. They are hurtful to all sides.”In Canada, the department of finance publisheda listof US products imported into Canada that it would target with a 25% retaliatory tariff starting on Tuesday.The list shows products that will be hit in the first round of retaliatory tariffs by Canada starting on Tuesday, and amounts to $30bn Canadian dollars’ worth of goods (about US$20bn). The products include tobacco, produce, household appliances, firearms and military gear.Canada is also preparing for a second, broader round of retaliatory tariffs in 21 days that will target an additional C$125bn (US$86bn) worth of US imports. The second list would include passenger vehicles, trucks, steel and aluminium products, certain fruits and vegetables, beef, pork, dairy products and more.Top Democrats warn tariffs will hit Americans hard as Trump says it’s ‘worth the price’Read moreClaudia Sheinbaum, Mexico’s president, said her government will provide more details on the retaliatory tariffs she ordered on US goods on Monday. Sheinbaum, in a statement on Sunday, said she would announce details on her government’s “plan B” as she insisted that Mexico “doesn’t want confrontation”.“Problems are not addressed by imposing tariffs, but with talks and dialogue,” she said. “Sovereignty is not negotiable: coordination yes, subordination no.”1:25'Coordination yes, subordination no': Mexican president responds to Trump's tariffs – videoSheinbaum and the Canadian prime minister,Justin Trudeau, spoke by phone on Saturday after Trump’s administration imposed the new tariffs – 25% on goods from Canada and Mexico, with a lower rate of 10% for Canadian oil, and 10% on imports from China.Trudeau’s office said in a statement that Canada and Mexico agreed “to enhance the strong bilateral relations” between their countries. Canadian officials have had extensive dialogue with their Mexican counterparts, but a senior Canadian official said he would not go as far as to say the tariff responses were coordinated.“Now is the time to choose products made right here in Canada,” Trudeau posted Sunday on X. “Check the labels. Let’s do our part. Wherever we can, choose Canada.”Trump acknowledged the sweeping tariffs he has imposed on Mexico, Canada and China could cause “short term” pain for Americans as global markets reflected concerns the levies could undermine growth and reignite inflation.

The imposition of tariffs by the US “seriously violates” World Trade Organization rules, China’s commerce ministry said in a statement, urging the US to “engage in frank dialogue and strengthen cooperation”.Beyond the official response, people were already thinking of ways to cope with Trump’s decision, including by sharing suggestions on social media for alternatives to US products.Canadian hockey fans booed the US national anthem on Saturday night at two National Hockey League games. The booing continued on Sunday at an NBA game in Toronto, where the Raptors played the Los Angeles Clippers.Toronto Raptors fans boo US national anthem after Donald Trump tariffsRead moreOne fan at the Raptors game chose to sit during the anthem while wearing a Canada hat. Joseph Chua, who works as an importer, said he expects to feel the tariffs “pretty directly”. “I’ve always stood during both anthems. I’ve taken my hat off to show respect to the American national anthem, but today we’re feeling a little bitter about things,” he said, adding that he will start to avoid buying US products.In the streets, people in Mexico were trying to absorb the announcement on Sunday, although some in the capital acknowledged that they were unaware of the measures.In the border city of Mexicali, across from Calexico, California, some people were concerned about the wider implications of a trade war.Driver Alejandro Acosta says that he crosses the border weekly in his truck to deliver vegetables to US companies. He said he fears US businesses in the Mexicali Valley will no longer want to operate in Mexico and they will move to the US.“If they raise taxes on the factories here, jobs may also decrease,” he said.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationCanadaMexicoDonald TrumpJustin TrudeauClaudia SheinbaumUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Taylor accused Chalmers of politicising the public service by asking his own department to analyse the Coalition proposal, for what he called a “nonsense” political attack.Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailThe prime minister,Anthony Albanese, ridiculed the meals policy as “the worst, sloppiest policy put forward by any opposition that I’ve seen in my entire time since I’ve been in parliament”.“This shows they are simply not fit as an alternative government. They have opposed every cost-of-living measure and this is all they’ve come up with.”Nuclear curious? Here’s what you need to know about the Coalition’s energy claimsRead moreAnnounced two weeks ago, the Coalition’s policy would allow businesses to claim up to $20,000 a year on meals and entertainment. Dutton and Taylor billed it as helping firms attract new clients with business lunches, or allowing bosses to reward workers after a hard week – but it attracted confusion last week over what expenses would be eligible, with differing reports as to whether work parties, golf days or football matches could be put on the public purse.The Coalition said it would release costings at some point in future. Senior Labor ministers derided the policy as a “farce”, claiming it amounted to using taxpayer money to “shout your boss steak tartare”.Dutton later clarified that the policy applied to meals only, not expenses such as function room hire or event tickets – but the opposition conceded hospitality or food at sporting matches or at a round of golf with clients would be permitted.He has said “about 98% of businesses in Australia” would be eligible for the tax deduction, and that the policy would help “2.5 million businesses”.Chalmers, in a release overnight, claimed the policy would cost $1.6bn a year, citing analysis from public servants – but that it could total “more than $10bn a year if all eligible businesses claimed what they’d be entitled to”.“In the absence of Opposition costings, the Government asked Treasury to cost a proposal based on parameters made publicly available by the Coalition,” Chalmers said.“The Liberals’ taxpayer-funded long lunches policy would smash the budget. This is why they won’t come clean on costings or cuts.”“If take up and average claims are higher than expected or if businesses rort the system by illegitimately claiming food and entertainment that is personal, not for business, the cost of the policy would increase substantially,” Chalmers said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He told Sky it would release “the detailed costings in advance of the next election”.The shadow treasurer accused Labor of using public servants to “attack, in pure political terms, the opposition”.Taylor said he would request “a full explanation” from the secretary of Treasury.“The public service is not there to make political attacks on your opponents,” he said. “The code of conduct is very clear on this. This is an egregious politicisation of a public service, which Labor is bloating for its own purposes.“We’ve had [the meals and entertainment policy] costed.

It’s nothing like what the treasurer is saying.”Responding in turn, Chalmers told a press conference: “It would be preferable if the Coalition had been upfront about this stuff [the policy].“We’ve released this costing because we think it’s important that Australians understand the risks to the budget from what is being proposed in Peter Dutton’s long lunches for bosses policy,” he told the ABC. “And if they’ve got a different costing, they should release it.”Explore more on these topicsAustralian politicsAnthony AlbaneseCoalitionLabor partyPeter DuttonJim ChalmersBusinessnewsShareReuse this content"

It involved a 13-hour 446km round-trip for the driver, from Sydney to Haylen’s holiday house at Caves Beach and then a Hunter Valley winery and back.It was reported on Monday that Haylen had also used a taxpayer-funded driver to ferry herself and her children from Caves Beach – about 100km north of Sydney – to the city for weekend sporting events.Ministerial cars and drivers can be used for private purposes under the current rules in NSW. But Haylen admitted on the weekend the Hunter Valley winery lunch failed the “pub test”.Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailThe premier, Chris Minns, on Tuesday was asked about potential further revelations. News Corp Australia reported the transport minister allegedly useda ministerial car to take her family west of the Blue Mountainsfor a lunch. Haylen was contacted for comment.Minns said “based on the information I have at the moment, I expect that the rules must be changed and, more importantly, the behaviour must change” – but he wouldn’t sack Haylen.“[But] if there’s other information and it comes to light and it’s presented to me ... I have to take that into consideration, and it would weigh very heavily on me,” the premier told 2GB radio.The premier said the revelations so far were “very damaging” and a “big black mark for the government”.“I can’t defend the indefensible – particularly for the Australia Day [weekend] event. You have got to treat taxpayer money as if it’s your own.”He said Labor should have changed the rules regarding the use of ministerial drivers as soon as his government was elected in early 2023 but he had hoped “good judgment would prevail”.“I am saying today … we are changing the rules in NSW to ensure that it’s used for official business purposes. If it’s private use, it’s only for incidental or minor parts of a minister’s job.”Minns said ministers were often tasked with weekend work and Haylen had said she was dropping her children at sporting events en route to work in Sydney.“[The driver] drove her from Caves Beach to Sydney to go to work and, on the way to work, the child was dropped at sport,” he said on Tuesday, adding ministers sometimes worked up to 70 hours a week.“In other words, the trip wasn’t so the kids could go to the sport on the weekends, the trip was so that she’d get to work.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMorning MailFree daily newsletterOur Australian morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The S&P 500 finished down 0.8% and the tech-focused Nasdaq was down 1.2%.The Dow Jones industrial average briefly broke out of the red to trade marginally higher, before closing down 0.3%.Earlier in the day in London, theFTSE100 share index shed 1.4% from last Friday’s record high, before clawing back some of its losses to trade down 1%.Germany’s DAX index fell by 1.5%, while France’s CAC 40 was down by 1.2%. Spain’s IBEX dropped 1.2% and Italy’s FTSE MIB lost 0.7%.Nvidia, the US tech company that suffered a record plunge in its price last week after the emergence of Chinese AI firm DeepSeek, was the biggest faller on the Dow, down more than 5%.Shares in some of the biggest European carmakers slumped. Volkswagen, BMW, Porsche, Volvo Cars, Stellantis and the commercial vehicle maker Daimler Truck fell between about 5% and 6%. The French car parts supplier Valeo slumped by 8%.Trumpannounced 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada, and a 10% tariffs on Chinese goods.In London, shares fell in companies across several industries. Shares in Scottish Mortgage Investment Trust, which has investments in US tech companies, the retailer JD Sports Fashion and the miner Antofagasta fell more than 4%.The pound edged lower against a strengthened US dollar, down 0.6% at $1.23, but rose 0.5% to €1.20 as the euro came under pressure.The Canadian dollar hit a 20-year low against the US dollar before recovering some losses. Doug Ford, the premier of Ontario, Canada’s most populous province, said he would ban US companies from provincial contracts until the tariffs are removed.He added: “US-based businesses will now lose out on tens of billions of dollars in new revenues. They only have President Trump to blame.“We’re going one step further. We’ll be ripping up the province’s contract with [Elon Musk’s] Starlink. Ontario won’t do business with people hellbent on destroying our economy.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Bitcoin, the world’s biggest cryptocurrency, hit a three-week low of $91,441.89 overnight and stood at $95,730.35, down 6.2%.One of Wall Street’s biggest banks, JPMorgan, expressed concern that the Trump administration was making conditions harder for businesses.The JP Morgan Chase chief economist, Bruce Kasman, said: “This weekend’s actions challenge our underlying view that the Trump administration will strive to limit disruptive policies as it balances its desire to reduce engagement with the world with a commitment to support US businesses.“In short, the risk is that the policy mix is tilting (perhaps unintentionally) into a business-unfriendly stance.”Richard Hunter, the head of markets at the online investment platform Interactive Investor, said: “February seems likely to begin with a Trump tariff tantrum.”Naeem Aslam, the chief investment officer at Zaye Capital Markets, said investors were bracing for heightened uncertainty in global trade and economic stability: “These downturns are driven by investor anxiety about the broader impact of tariffs on the global economy, particularly as European economies are highly intertwined with US trade policies.”Kathleen Brooks, the research director at XTB, said: “This does not mean that the UK economy will avoid impact from the tariffs, but it does mean that the UK economy could be more resilient than elsewhere.”She added: “It’s too early to know exactly what impact tariffs will have on the global economy, but it is fair to say that they have a high potential of triggering inflation, and weighing heavily on global growth, including the US economy.”Explore more on these topicsStock marketsEconomicsGermanyFranceSpainItalyFTSEnewsShareReuse this content"

The bloc’s foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, said there would be “no winners in a trade war”.Europe and the US needed each other, she said, while the Polish prime minister, Donald Tusk, said a trade war was “a complete mistake” and everything possible must be done to stop allies fighting “in the face of a Russian threat or Chinese expansion”.The Danish prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, said Copenhagen would generally “never support fighting allies”, but “[if theTrump administrationimposes] tough tariffs on Europe, we need a collective and robust response”.1:02Trump says EU will be hit with tariffs as he takes softer line on UK – videoTrumpimposed swingeing tariffson goods imported from Canada, Mexico and China on Saturday,sparking retaliationfrom all three countries. He said on Sunday night that new tariffs on the EU would “definitely happen”.The US president repeated longstanding complaints about the size of the US trade deficit with the bloc and demanded Europe import more American cars and farm products. “It will definitely happen with the EU, I can tell you that,” he said.Trump said that although there was no specific timeline for European tariffs, it was “going to be pretty soon”. He told reporters on Friday he would “absolutely, absolutely” impose them. “TheEuropean Unionhas treated us so terribly,” he said.Speaking after a day of talks overshadowed by Trump’s threat of tariffs, theEuropean CommissionPresident Ursula von der Leyen said the EU was ready “for robust but constructive dialogue” with the US. “When targeted unfairly or arbitrarily, the European Union will respond firmly,” she added.She said the “steep tariffs” imposed on Canada and Mexico “raise business costs, “harm workers and consumers” and create “unnecessary economic disruption”. Both countries were given a 30-day reprieve by Trump on Monday, after global stock markets tumbled after his weekend announcement.The European Council president António Costa said EU member states had agreed with Nato secretary general Mark Rutte that “a stronger Europe of defence also strengthens the transatlantic partnership”. Earlier in the day Rutte said it was clear that the US was “selling much more” defence equipment to Europe than vice versa and that there was “so much money floating around” with more to come as European Nato allies increase defence spending.During his first term, Trump imposed tariffs on steel and aluminium imports from the EU, which retaliated with trade levies onemblematic US goodsfrom Republican states such as Harley-Davidson motorbikes, bourbon, denim and orange juice.Leaders called for more dialogue with Washington. Ireland’s prime minister, Micheál Martin, said the EU and US “need to work together constructively” on trade because protectionism would hurt citizens “wherever they reside”.Finland’s prime minister, Petteri Orpo, also said Europe must negotiate with Trump on trade. “I am not going to start a war, I want to start negotiations,” he said, adding that the biggest threat to Europe was Russia.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Luxembourg’s prime minister, Luc Frieden, said the answer to trade tariffs was to “reply with the same measures”, though tariffs were “always bad”.Spain’s economy minister, Carlos Cuerpo, told RNE radio that although the EU was open to trade and in favour of a globalised market, it should not be naive and would protect its companies to ensure they were in a position to compete on a level playing field.UK and European stock markets tumble amid ‘Trump tariff tantrum’Read moreThe Nato secretary general, Mark Rutte, said it was clear the US was “selling much more” defence equipment to Europe than vice versa and that there was more money to come as European Nato allies increased defence spending.But the French industry minister, Marc Ferracci,told France Info radioon Sunday night that trade talks with Washington must embody “a form of power dynamic”. The bloc must wait for Trump’s final decision, but a response should be prepared now, he said.To be effective, any response must “focus on products that are important” to the US and be “biting” – meaning it must “have an impact on the American economy to have a credible threat in negotiations”.Germany’s conservative opposition leader, Friedrich Merz, who is expected to become the country’s next chancellor, said Trump would swiftly realise the tariffs he imposes “will not have to be paid by those who import into America … but by consumers in America”.The governor of France’s central bank, François Villeroy de Galhau, said the tariffs Trump had already imposed were “brutal”. They would increase economic uncertainty and were a worrying development, he said.Additional reporting by Jennifer RankinExplore more on these topicsEuropean UnionTrump administrationInternational tradeEuropean CommissionEconomicsEuropeGlobal economynewsShareReuse this content"

Facing criticism that the UK had been vague in its hopes for this pact, he said it should cover military technology, research and development, improved mobility of forces acrossEurope, protection of critical infrastructure and deepening industrial collaboration to boost production.Starmer’s EU dinner date a big moment in tricky tightrope actRead more“We can’t be commentators when it comes to matters of peace on our continent,” he told reporters. “We must lead and that’s what I’ve determined that we will do.”Starmer was speaking at Nato headquarters after meeting the alliance’s secretary general, Mark Rutte, who reiterated that allies needed to spend “considerably more” than the current target of 2% of GDP.Later, over a dinner of celeriac soup and sea bream, Starmer told European leaders he wanted deeper EU-UK cooperation against state threats and sabotage. He raised the issue followinga spate of incidents where subsea cables were damaged, raising suspicions of Russian or Chinese state-sponsored sabotage.With the French president, Emmanuel Macron, calling for a “buy European” armaments policy, Starmer urged EU leaders not to exclude the UK from spending plans. “Fragmentation would weaken us all,” he said, according to remarks released by Number 10. “Instead, let’s maximise the industrial weight and clout that we have together.”In calling for deeper defence industry collaboration, the prime minister cited the European aerospace and defence company Airbus and the French defence firm Thales - the latter employs 7,000 people in the UK. “Look at Airbus or Thales – their success in the UK boosts defence across Europe,” he said.After dinner, the European Council president, António Costa, told reporters that “everyone was delighted to welcome Sir Keir Starmer … and to say clearly that the United Kingdom and theEuropean Unionare reliable and predictable partners”.Costa said he expected the EU and UK to hold a summit in the UK on 19 May to build “the closest relationship it will be possible to build together”.But a majority of member states are demanding the UK sign up to the EU’s demands on fishing rights and a youth mobility scheme as part of a broader package to reset the relationship, including security.Managing the negotiations will fall to the European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen, who sidestepped a question on the sequencing of talks. She said it was “very good to have a thorough discussion with prime minister Keir Starmer because European security concerns us all inside and outside the European Union”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Poland has the EU’s rotating presidency and Tusk said it was his idea to invite Starmer to have the UK as “close as possible” on security issues and “to find ways to eliminate or reduce barriers in trade between the UK and Europe”.Before Starmer arrived, the EU27 held day-long talks to discuss defence, but the meeting wasovershadowed by Trump’s threats to impose tariffs on the bloc.Asked earlier in the day whether he was worried by Donald Trump’s refusal to rule out hitting the UK with tariffs, the prime minister said “obviously, it’s early days”.“I think what’s really important is open and strong trading relations and that’s been the basis of my discussions with President Trump,” he said. “I know that intense US-EU discussions are planned.”UK government officials have already drawn up retaliatory tariffs that could be quickly imposed on US goods if Trump decided to start a trade war.Starmer said the UK did not have to choose between the EU and the US, when asked if he would weaken his reset with the bloc to keep Trump happy. “Both of these relations are very important to us. We are not choosing between them, but that’s historically been the position of the UK for many, many decades.”The Nato secretary general downplayed Trump’s tariff strategy and looming trade war, saying he was “absolutely convinced” Nato could deal with trade tensions between the US and Canada. Rutte said European defence without Nato was “a silly thought” and would not work.Arriving at the dinner, Starmer said rejoining the EU was not going to happen, but there could be “a better, closer relationship when it comes to trade and security”.His trip to Brussels came as Reform ​t​ook a lead overLabourfor the first time in a national opinion poll​. ​A Sky News/YouGov poll​ released on Monday evening put Nigel Farage’s party on 25%, a point ahead of Labour. It also found one in five people who voted Conservative at the last general election would now vote for Reform.Explore more on these topicsForeign policyKeir StarmerEuropean UnionBrexitUK security and counter-terrorismLabourEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

[it] will have to stand up for itself and therefore react.”Polish prime ministerDonald Tusksaid the EU should do all it can to avoid “totally unnecessary and stupid tariff wars,” adding it would be a “cruel paradox” if the bloc was forced into a trade war with a long-standing ally.Danish prime ministerMette Frederiksen, who is already embroiled in a separate crisis with Trump over the future of Greenland, said that while she would typically “never support fighting allies, if the US puts tough tariffs on Europe, we need a collective and robust response.”Luxembourg’s prime ministerLuc Friedenalso said that “the answer to tariffs is to reply with [the] same action,” but insisted it should not overshadow today’s discussions on defence.But some leaders struck a more conciliatory tone.German chancellorOlaf Scholzsaid any tariffs would be “bad for the US and bad for Europe,” and stressed the need for cooperation to resolve this situation.Finnish prime ministerPetteri Orposaid: “We have to negotiate with Trump,” before adding: “I am not going to start a war, I want to start negotiations.”France's president Emmanuel Macron speaks to the press as he arrives for an informal EU leaders' retreat at the Palais d'Egmont in Brussels.Photograph: Nicolas Tucat/AFP/Getty ImagesShare"

We want to make it small, we want to make it a footnote.”Germans protest against party leader who pushed migration bill backed by far rightRead moreReferring to the tens of thousands of demonstrators who turned out in cities acrossGermanyat the weekend to criticise Merz’s high-stakes gamble with the AfD, the CDU leader took a startlingly aggressive approach, accusing the protesters of hypocrisy.Merz demanded: “I want to know: where is the uprising of decent people?” in the face of a “never-before-seen hatred of Israel” since the 7 October attacks by Hamas and “an antisemitism that deeply shames us all … against which the reaction has been too hesitant”.“I say to all those who were out yesterday: you picked the wrong date and the wrong issue,” he said.View image in fullscreenPeople marched in cities including Berlin (pictured) on 2 February to protest against Merz’s migration plans and cooperation with the far-right Alternative for Germany party (AfD).Photograph: Annegret Hilse/ReutersDrumming home a law-and-order message in the last weeks of the campaign, Merz argued that mainstream parties had to offer a tougher response to violent crimes, such as last month’sdeadly stabbing attackagainst small children in the southern city of Aschaffenburg, or risk losing ground to extremists.“The open outbreaks of violence on our streets and in well-known parts of town around certain events such as New Year’s Eve and May Day undermine the faith of our population in the rule of law and allow our state to often appear powerless and defenceless,” he said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It said it believed the spyware was made by Paragon Solutions, an Israel-based company that was recently taken over by a US private equity company.Paragon declined to comment. A person close to the company said it had about 35 government clients, which the person described as democratic governments.What is Pegasus spyware and how does it hack phones?Read moreIn El Gomati’s case, the discovery was made shortly after he said in Facebook posts that he had gained access to documents fromLibyaabout illegal migration networks, their connection to detention centres, and alleged links between militia leaders in Tripoli and Zawia and Italian intelligence officers.Italy’s support of the Libyan coastguard and militias in Libya to help stop people from crossing the Mediterraneanhas long been a subject of criticismby activists, who say it has sown chaos in the country.El Gomati says he is worried for the safety of his confidential sources in Libya. When a phone is successfully penetrated by Paragon’s spyware, which is called Graphite, the user of the spyware has total control of a person’s phone, including being able to read encrypted messages on apps such as Signal and WhatsApp.“As an activist against corruption in Libya, protecting my sources is of utmost importance. There are individuals risking their lives to expose the deep-rooted corruption in my country and the corruption of the ruling class,” he said. “These matters can mean the difference between life and death.”He added: “The thought of someone eavesdropping on you all day, reading your messages and having access to pictures of your children is terrifying.”Like other makers of military-grade spyware, Paragon – which was founded by the former Israeli prime minister Ehud Barak – sells its spyware to government clients for the expressed purpose of targeting possible criminals. The company had reportedly agreed a $2m (£1.6m) contract with US immigration services last year under the Biden administration, but the dealwas put on hold and placed under reviewafter questions were raised about whether it complied with a Biden-era executive order limiting the use of spyware by the US government.El Gomati contacted the Guardian about the alert he had received by WhatsApp just hours after the Guardian published a separate story aboutan Italian investigative journalist, Francesco Cancellato, who also received an alert from WhatsApp about his phone having possibly been compromised by the same spyware.Cancellato is the editor-in-chief of Fanpage, an investigative outlet that gained attention last year after it published a report aboutyoung fascistswithin the far-right party of Giorgia Meloni, Italy’s prime minister.It is not clear what government client was behind the targeting of El Gomati and Cancellato. WhatsApp said the targets it sent alerts to live in more than two dozen countries, including in Europe.Meloni’s office Meloni did not respond to a request for comment.More recently, El Gomati said he had been playing an active role in reporting onthe case of Osama Najim, also known as Almasri. Najim, who is the chief of Libya’s judicial police, is wanted by the international criminal court (ICC) for alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity, as well as alleged rape and murder.He also presides over Mitiga prison, a facility near Tripoli condemned by human rights organisations for the arbitrary detention, torture and abuse of political dissidents, migrants and refugees.He was freed last month owing to a procedural technicality and flown on an official state aircraft to Tripoli. The ICC demanded an explanation, saying on Wednesday that he had been released from custody and transported back to Libya by Meloni’s government “without prior notice or consultation with the court”.Explore more on these topicsWhatsAppLibyaIsraelGiorgia MeloniMiddle East and north AfricaItalySurveillancenewsShareReuse this content"

If doubts creep in, disappointments follow.” He claimed to have witnessed instances where devotees received approvals within hours of performing rituals, even after multiple rejections.Modi’s government planning to repatriate 18,000 Indians living in US illegallyRead moreSome travelled far from other states, convinced of the temple’s reputation for securing visa approvals, Bhatt said.Emigrating to the US has long been a status symbol for many Indians. But Trump has put such ambitions in doubt, demanding tougher visa vetting procedures.However, there is a split among some of Trump’s biggest backers over the flagshipH-1B visa programme,which allows software engineers and other skilled workers to work in the US. At least two-thirds of H-1B recipients come from India.The row has pitted technology industry supporters such as Elon Musk against immigration hardliners who want the scheme scrapped. Musk says the programme needs “major reform” but also that there is not enough homegrown talent to fill skilled jobs.At Hyderabad’s Chilkur Balaji temple – dubbed the “Visa God” shrine – aspiring emigrants have been chanting prayers, performing rituals and completing 108 circumambulations barefoot, hoping for divine intervention.Among them was a software engineer from Hyderabad who was due to start a new job in New Jersey in April. He had received his H-1B visa approval and was back to offer thanks. “Eleven of us applied last year, but I was the only one who got it,” the engineer told the Times of India, asking to remain anonymous.Another software engineer, Chandana, 26, who did not want her last name used, said she was dismayed when Trump won. She had been visiting the temple every month since applying for a visa two years ago. “I know things aren’t looking bright right now, but I have faith I will get it, just like my relatives did,” she said.In Delhi’s Shree Siddhi Peeth Chamatkari Hanuman Mandir, applicants are taking their devotion even further. “Many people give up meat, alcohol, onion and garlic for 41 days hoping their visa will be granted,” said Narayan Mishra, the temple priest.Devotees write their wishes on slips of paper, which are placed before the deity and chanted over before being stored in a sacred box. “People come in a very disturbed state of mind. This is their last resort, and we usually find that their wishes do come true,” Mishra said.Explore more on these topicsIndiaSouth and central AsiaHinduismDonald TrumpUS immigrationReligionnewsShareReuse this content"

The paper argues that conscious AI systems could be built in the near future – or at least ones that give the impression of being conscious.“It may be the case that large numbers of conscious systems could be created and caused to suffer,” the researchers say, adding that if powerful AI systems were able to reproduce themselves it could lead to the creation of “large numbers of new beings deserving moral consideration”.The paper, written by Oxford University’s Patrick Butlin and Theodoros Lappas of the Athens University of Economics and Business, adds that even companies not intending to create conscious systems will need guidelines in case of “inadvertently creating conscious entities”.It acknowledges that there is widespread uncertainty and disagreement over defining consciousness in AI systems and whether it is even possible, but says it is an issue that “we must not ignore”.Other questions raised by the paper focus on what to do with an AI system if it is defined as a “moral patient” – an entity that matters morally “in its own right, for its own sake”. In that scenario, it questions if destroying the AI would be comparable to killing an animal.The paper, published in the Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, also warned that a mistaken belief that AI systems are already conscious could lead to a waste of political energy as misguided efforts are made to promote their welfare.The paper and letter were organised by Conscium, a research organisation part-funded by WPP and co-founded by WPP’s chief AI officer, Daniel Hulme.Last year agroup of senior academicsargued there was a “realistic possibility” that some AI systems will be conscious and “morally significant” by 2035.In 2023, Sir Demis Hassabis, the head of Google’s AI programme and a Nobel prize winner, said AI systems were “definitely” not sentient currently but could be in the future.“Philosophers haven’t really settled on a definition of consciousness yet but if we mean sort of self-awareness, these kinds of things, I think there’s a possibility AI one day could be,” he said in an interview with US broadcaster CBS.Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)EthicsStephen FrynewsShareReuse this content"

The agency was set up after Labour’s general election win, with the decision made last year to headquarter it in Aberdeen – the oil and gas capital of Europe – and the ambition of cutting costs for consumers.Maier said the Labour-backed organisation would create 200 to 300 roles in Aberdeen over the next five years.He told Sky News: “In the very long term, as we become a major energy champion, it may be many more [jobs] than that. Energy companies grow over 10 or 20 years. We are going to be around in 20 years as a British energy champion.”Asked if it could take 20 years to get to 1,000 jobs, he responded: “Absolutely.”Maier, a former chief executive of machine industry firm Siemens UK, highlighted there would also be thousands of jobs created in the wider renewable energy supply chain through the activities of GB Energy.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

People were promised lower fuel bills because of GB Energy. The chair of GB Energy told the media this morning that won’t be realised for some considerable time to come.”Scottish Tory leader Russell Findlay said: “Prior to the election, they couldn’t even tell us what GB Energy was going to be, other than a plaque on a building in Aberdeen.“It now turns out that Keir Starmer will be 80 years old before they employ the number of people they say it is going to employ, but I would even take that with a gigantic pinch of salt.”Explore more on these topicsEnergy industryRenewable energyEnergynewsShareReuse this content"

Some administration officials believe an executive order should wait until McMahon’s Senate confirmation hearing, which has not yet been scheduled.During his election campaign, Trumppromised to eliminate the education department– which he described as being infiltrated by “radicals, zealots and Marxists” – and give states all power to control.A US president alone cannot eliminate a department, as Congress is required to approve the creation or demise of an agency.But Trump officials can alter key parts of the department’s budget and policies, or replicate the approach they used with the US agency for international development (USAid) this past week.In recent days,Musk’s representatives at Doge have suspended senior USAid staff, shut down its website, accessed sensitive personnel files and locked employees out of the Washington DC office.Workers for Doge, an unofficial government department with no congressionally approved mandate, have also reportedlygained accessto the US treasury’s highly sensitive database and federal payments systemA Doge team was working at the education department on Monday to implement Trump’s executive orders and agenda, an education department spokesperson confirmed.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationDonald TrumpElon MuskUS educationUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

A year ago Parton confirmed the reboot was in the works,saying: “They’re still working on that. They’re thinking about bringing it back and revamping it.”‘If the apocalypse comes, beep me!’: Buffy the Vampire Slayer at 25Read moreNo other actors from the original series have yet been confirmed to return but the Deadline writer Nellie Andreeva wrote: “Beyond the pilot order, I hear the reboot is starting a writers room soon, a sign that Hulu and the studios have high expectations for the project going to series.”Andreeva also reported that the Buffycreator Joss Whedon would have no involvement in the reboot,three years after he was accused of misconduct on the sets of numerous projects. Whedon has denied all allegations of threats and cruelty made by several actors including the Buffy actor Charisma Carpenter, who played Cordelia.A Buffy reboot would be the third series in the “Buffyverse”, coming almost 30 years after Buffy the Vampire Slayer began in 1997 and finished in 2003, and more than 20 years after the spin-off series Angel ended, having run for five seasons between 1999 and 2004.Gellar has previously been against the idea of a Buffy reboot, saying in 2023: “I am very proud of the show that we created, and [a revival] doesn’t need to be done. We wrapped that up.“I am all for them continuing the story, because there’s the story of female empowerment … [but] the metaphors of Buffy were the horrors of adolescence. I think I look young but I am not an adolescent.”But late last year Gellar revealed that she had changed her mind after seeing other successful reboots, saying: “It’s funny, I always used to say no, because it’s in its bubble and it’s so perfect. But watching Sex and the City and seeing Dexter, and realising there are ways to do it, definitely does get your mind thinking, ‘Well, maybe.’”Deadline reported that negotiations with Gellar for the reboot had begun after these comments became public.Other shows that have confirmed reboots includeMalcolm in the Middleand Scrubs.Explore more on these topicsBuffy the Vampire SlayerTelevisionnewsShareReuse this content"

If approved, the hike would average a 22% increase for policyholders.The insurance giant claims that the fires have put the company under increased financial strain. The company has already received at least 8,700 claims and paid more than $1bn to customers and expects to pay out “significantly more”, according to apress release.“Insurance will cost more for customers in California going forward because the risk is greater in California,” the statement reads. “That is foundational to how insurance works. Higher risks should pay more for insurance than lower risks.”The recent wildfires have been one of the most expensive natural disasters the insurance has faced in its history. They go on to warn that further “capital deterioration” as a result of the wildfires could harm their ability to pay out insurance across the board, including customers with a mortgage possibly losing the ability to “use State Farm General insurance on the collateral backing for their mortgage”.The statement says that “immediate emergency interim approval of additional rate is essential to more closely align cost and risk and enable State Farm General to rebuild capital”.Consumer Watchdog, a LA-based advocacy group, disputed that State Farm General was in financial trouble. They claim that the insurers made underwriting profits of $1.4bin between 2020 and 2023, and that parent company State Farm Mutual had “$134 billion in the bank”.“Filling State Farm’s bank accounts shouldn’t fall on the backs of California homeowners recovering from disaster,” the group told theLos Angeles Times.State Farm currently insures about 1 million homeowners in the state of California, and also has an additional 2.8m other policies active across the state.‘We won’t be able to return to our house’: the struggle to recover from LA wildfiresRead moreIn June of last year, the company sought a 30% rate hike for homeowners polices, as well as a 36% increase for condo owners and a 52% increase for renters. The sudden increase raised questions about the insurer’s financial stability.State Farm chosenot to renewfire insurance for 1,626 State Farm customers in the Palisades neighborhood in 2024, according to California’s insurance office. They represented about 70% of State Farm’s market share in Pacific Palisades, according to the San Francisco Chronicle.Finding fire insurance for homes in areas with high fire risk is a challenge that will only increase for Californians, experts predict. Michael Coffey, an insurance defense litigator who works on large, global insurance cases, says he expects more insurance companies to leave the state – forcing prices up for everyone.The company notes that they’ve made the decision in recent years to “limit overexposure” in high-risk areas. The company previously stopped writing any new policies in California in May 2023, with the exception of personal auto insurance policies.Last month, State Farm announced that it had canceled a planned commercial scheduled to run during the 2025 Super Bowl, citing the LA wildfires as their main priority.“Our focus is firmly on providing support to the people of Los Angeles. We will not be advertising during the game as originally planned,” the company said in a statement toCBS MoneyWatch.Katharine Gammon contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsCaliforniaCalifornia wildfiresWest CoastInsurance industryExtreme weathernewsShareReuse this content"

China is still set to face additional 10% levy on its exports to the US from Tuesday.Following talks with the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, and the Mexican president,Claudia Sheinbaum, on Monday, Trump agreed at the last minuteto hold off from imposing new duties on the two countries.The agreements came on a day of extreme volatility in global financial markets as rattled investors reacted to the prospect of a dramatically escalating dispute involving the world’s largest economies.The US president had upended US-Mexico ties over the weekend when he announced 25% tariffs and accused Sheinbaum’s administration of engaging in an “intolerable alliance” with Mexican crime groups.Sheinbaum rejected that “slanderous” accusation, but on Monday morning struck a softer note as she announced “a series of agreements” with Trump after a conversation between the two leaders during which they agreed to pause US tariffs for a month to allow for fresh negotiations.Mexico had agreed to send 10,000 members of its national guard “to prevent drug trafficking from Mexico to the US, in particular of fentanyl”, Sheinbaum said. In return, the US had agreed to work to prevent high-powered weapons crossing the border into Mexico.Mitch McConnell calls Trump tariffs ‘bad idea’ but most Republicans toe lineRead moreTrump confirmed the deal shortly afterwards on his Truth Social network. He said 10,000 Mexican soldiers would be “specifically designated to stop the flow of fentanyl, and illegal migrants into our country”.Negotiations involving senior Mexican officials, the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, the US treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, and the US commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick, would take place during the pause, he said.Following two calls with Trump on Monday, Trudeau announced that tariffs would be “paused” for 30 days. “Canada is implementing our $1.3bn border plan – reinforcing the border with new choppers, technology and personnel, enhanced coordination with our American partners, and increased resources to stop the flow of fentanyl,” he said in a statement. “Nearly 10,000 frontline personnel are and will be working on protecting the border.”Trump wrote on Truth Social: “As President, it is my responsibility to ensure the safety of ALL Americans, and I am doing just that. I am very pleased with this initial outcome, and the Tariffs announced on Saturday will be paused for a 30 day period to see whether or not a final Economic deal with Canada can be structured. FAIRNESS FOR ALL!”Late last year, Trump threatened to impose tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China on the first day of his presidency. From the first day of his presidency, he said he would do so from 1 February. This weekend, he said they would kick in from 4 February. They have now been delayed until March.Economists have warned Trump’s planned wave of tariffs would risk raising prices for millions of Americans, just weeks after he pledged, upon taking office, to “rapidly” bring them down.On Monday, however, Trump maintained that tariffs were a “very powerful” means of both strengthening the US economically and “getting everything else you want”. He had conceded over the weekend that they could cause “a little pain” in the US.Markets sold off sharply worldwide in response to what has been described as a “Trump tariff tantrum” before recovering some of their losses after news broke of the deal with Mexico. Wall Street fell in early trading, with the S&P 500 down almost 2%. Share prices in Europe followed a sharp move lower in Asia.London’s FTSE 100 index dropped 1.4% from Friday’s record high before making back some of its losses to trade down 1%.Trump also indicated on Sunday that the EU would be next to face tariffs, but did not say when.EU leaders meeting at an informal summit in Brussels on Monday said Europe would fight back if the US imposed tariffs, but called for negotiation. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, said that if the bloc’s commercial interests were attacked it would “make itself respected and thus react”.The German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, said the EU could respond if necessary with its own tariffs, but stressed it would be better for the two sides to find agreement on trade.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst ThingFree daily newsletterOur US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I know that intense US-EU discussions are planned.”Officials, analysts and economists who believe Trump’s tariffs could have disastrous consequences for the global economy and for Washinton’s place in the world voiced relief at the Mexico deal.Experts believe Trump’s plans for 10% tariffs on China and 25% on Canada and Mexico would hamper global growth and cause inflation in the US. Even Trump admitted on Sunday that the measures might cause “a little pain”.Brian Winter, the editor-in-chief ofAmericasQuarterly magazine and a Latin America expert, said: “I don’t think anyone expected a resolution today, and obviously it’s a relief. But the damage is done.“I can personally imagine a scenario where, within a year, President Trump is on buddy-buddy terms again with Mexico. But you cannot unsee what happened over the last 48 hours. And if companies make decisions in terms of years and decades, how they think about Mexico specifically, and its place in the US value chain, is forever changed.”Speaking at her daily press conference in Mexico City, Sheinbaum told reporters that at the end of a 30- to 45-minute conversation with Trump, she had joked with him that she would like to see tariffs suspended forever. She said she believed a one-month reprieve represented a good deal, however, and painted the agreement as a win for both sides.“In Mexico we have rocket launchers that come from the US illegally … How can these high-powered weapons get into Mexico from the US?” she asked, hailing Trump’s apparent commitment to fight gun smuggling as part of the agreement.Winter said he believed that in some ways Trump’s strong-arm tactics appeared to be working.​Four of his opening moves on the world stage have come in Latin America: diplomatic tussles with Colombia and Venezuela over the deportation of migrants; with Mexico over drug trafficking and migration; and with Panama over supposed Chinese involvement in the Panama canal. In all four cases, Trump has managed to claim victory or extract concessions, although critics argue many of those are largely cosmetic and designed to achieve little more than to please his base.Winter said: “There’s no doubt that Trump’s approach has produced tangible short-term results in Latin America, decisions that were made with a scope and timeline that otherwise would not have been possible … I think you have to acknowledge​ that each of these governments have moved far more quickly to accommodate Washington than they would have under a more traditional request.“The question is, though: what does this do to Washington’s alliances in the medium term? Does it push these countries closer to China? I have my doubts … but with all of these crises, scars remain. I think that governments understand that this is an even more transactional government than in Donald Trump’s first term, and that they can’t really think in terms of alliances anymore with the United States. That’s a huge change.​”Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationClaudia SheinbaumMexicoDonald TrumpUS foreign policyInternational tradeDrugs tradenewsShareReuse this content"

Shares in Scottish Mortgage Investment Trust, which has investments in US tech companies, the retailer JD Sports Fashion and the miner Antofagasta fell more than 4%.The pound edged lower against a strengthened US dollar, down 0.6% at $1.23, but rose 0.5% to €1.20 as the euro came under pressure.The Canadian dollar hit a 20-year low against the US dollar before recovering some losses. Doug Ford, the premier of Ontario, Canada’s most populous province, said he would ban US companies from provincial contracts until the tariffs are removed.He added: “US-based businesses will now lose out on tens of billions of dollars in new revenues. They only have President Trump to blame.“We’re going one step further. We’ll be ripping up the province’s contract with [Elon Musk’s] Starlink.

Bitcoin, the world’s biggest cryptocurrency, hit a three-week low of $91,441.89 overnight and stood at $95,730.35, down 6.2%.One of Wall Street’s biggest banks, JPMorgan, expressed concern that the Trump administration was making conditions harder for businesses.The JP Morgan Chase chief economist, Bruce Kasman, said: “This weekend’s actions challenge our underlying view that the Trump administration will strive to limit disruptive policies as it balances its desire to reduce engagement with the world with a commitment to support US businesses.“In short, the risk is that the policy mix is tilting (perhaps unintentionally) into a business-unfriendly stance.”Richard Hunter, the head of markets at the online investment platform Interactive Investor, said: “February seems likely to begin with a Trump tariff tantrum.”Naeem Aslam, the chief investment officer at Zaye Capital Markets, said investors were bracing for heightened uncertainty in global trade and economic stability: “These downturns are driven by investor anxiety about the broader impact of tariffs on the global economy, particularly as European economies are highly intertwined with US trade policies.”Kathleen Brooks, the research director at XTB, said: “This does not mean that the UK economy will avoid impact from the tariffs, but it does mean that the UK economy could be more resilient than elsewhere.”She added: “It’s too early to know exactly what impact tariffs will have on the global economy, but it is fair to say that they have a high potential of triggering inflation, and weighing heavily on global growth, including the US economy.”Explore more on these topicsStock marketsEconomicsGermanyFranceSpainItalyFTSEnewsShareReuse this content"

The bloc’s foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, said there would be “no winners in a trade war”.Europe and the US needed each other, she said, while the Polish prime minister, Donald Tusk, said a trade war was “a complete mistake” and everything possible must be done to stop allies fighting “in the face of a Russian threat or Chinese expansion”.The Danish prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, said Copenhagen would generally “never support fighting allies”, but “[if theTrump administrationimposes] tough tariffs on Europe, we need a collective and robust response”.1:02Trump says EU will be hit with tariffs as he takes softer line on UK – videoTrumpimposed swingeing tariffson goods imported from Canada, Mexico and China on Saturday,sparking retaliationfrom all three countries. He said on Sunday night that new tariffs on the EU would “definitely happen”.The US president repeated longstanding complaints about the size of the US trade deficit with the bloc and demanded Europe import more American cars and farm products. “It will definitely happen with the EU, I can tell you that,” he said.Trump said that although there was no specific timeline for European tariffs, it was “going to be pretty soon”. He told reporters on Friday he would “absolutely, absolutely” impose them. “TheEuropean Unionhas treated us so terribly,” he said.Speaking after a day of talks overshadowed by Trump’s threat of tariffs, theEuropean CommissionPresident Ursula von der Leyen said the EU was ready “for robust but constructive dialogue” with the US. “When targeted unfairly or arbitrarily, the European Union will respond firmly,” she added.She said the “steep tariffs” imposed on Canada and Mexico “raise business costs, “harm workers and consumers” and create “unnecessary economic disruption”. Both countries were given a 30-day reprieve by Trump on Monday, after global stock markets tumbled after his weekend announcement.The European Council president António Costa said EU member states had agreed with Nato secretary general Mark Rutte that “a stronger Europe of defence also strengthens the transatlantic partnership”. Earlier in the day Rutte said it was clear that the US was “selling much more” defence equipment to Europe than vice versa and that there was “so much money floating around” with more to come as European Nato allies increase defence spending.During his first term, Trump imposed tariffs on steel and aluminium imports from the EU, which retaliated with trade levies onemblematic US goodsfrom Republican states such as Harley-Davidson motorbikes, bourbon, denim and orange juice.Leaders called for more dialogue with Washington. Ireland’s prime minister, Micheál Martin, said the EU and US “need to work together constructively” on trade because protectionism would hurt citizens “wherever they reside”.Finland’s prime minister, Petteri Orpo, also said Europe must negotiate with Trump on trade. “I am not going to start a war, I want to start negotiations,” he said, adding that the biggest threat to Europe was Russia.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Luxembourg’s prime minister, Luc Frieden, said the answer to trade tariffs was to “reply with the same measures”, though tariffs were “always bad”.Spain’s economy minister, Carlos Cuerpo, told RNE radio that although the EU was open to trade and in favour of a globalised market, it should not be naive and would protect its companies to ensure they were in a position to compete on a level playing field.UK and European stock markets tumble amid ‘Trump tariff tantrum’Read moreThe Nato secretary general, Mark Rutte, said it was clear the US was “selling much more” defence equipment to Europe than vice versa and that there was more money to come as European Nato allies increased defence spending.But the French industry minister, Marc Ferracci,told France Info radioon Sunday night that trade talks with Washington must embody “a form of power dynamic”. The bloc must wait for Trump’s final decision, but a response should be prepared now, he said.To be effective, any response must “focus on products that are important” to the US and be “biting” – meaning it must “have an impact on the American economy to have a credible threat in negotiations”.Germany’s conservative opposition leader, Friedrich Merz, who is expected to become the country’s next chancellor, said Trump would swiftly realise the tariffs he imposes “will not have to be paid by those who import into America … but by consumers in America”.The governor of France’s central bank, François Villeroy de Galhau, said the tariffs Trump had already imposed were “brutal”. They would increase economic uncertainty and were a worrying development, he said.Additional reporting by Jennifer RankinExplore more on these topicsEuropean UnionTrump administrationInternational tradeEuropean CommissionEconomicsEuropeGlobal economynewsShareReuse this content"

It also owns Guinness.Photograph: Andrew Kelly/ReutersDiageoHow fortunes turned flat at Johnnie Walker and Guinness owner DiageoWith crucial results looming, investors fear 25 years of dividend growth may stall this week as drinks firm battles major headwindsRob DaviesMon 3 Feb 2025 01.00 ESTShare“Good things come to those who wait” may have been an effective slogan for selling Guinness but City investors are demanding more urgency to slake their thirst.With a crucial half-year results presentation likely to take place on Tuesday, their patience with the boss ofDiageo– the global drinks company that makes the “black stuff” – appears to be wearing thin.Debra Crew, a former captain in US military intelligence, took command of the £55bn British company in tragic and difficult circumstances.She was appointed on 5 June 2023, after Ivan Menezes – a charming and popular figure who had steered Diageo successfully for 10 years – was taken to hospital.Two days later he died, aged 63, leaving a company in mourning for the man Crew has described as Diageo’s “father”.For all the shock of Menezes’s passing, the company was widely thought to be in decent shape, thanks in large part to the legacy of his steady stewardship, includingduring the turbulent pandemic period. Crew – Diageo’s first female boss – had been groomed as the natural heir, first as a board member and then as president of the North America region..But the carefully laid succession plan has not unfolded as Diageo might have hoped.Crew’s tenure has been marked by ashock profits warning, adverse global consumer trends and investor disquiet.Like many a night fuelled by one of Diageo’s spirits, which include Gordon’s gin and Smirnoff vodka, it all started out merrily enough.Sales had rebounded from the pandemic with a buoyancy that seemed unimaginable during the depths of the Covid-19 shutdowns.Diageo’s strategy of “premiumisation” – honed under Menezes – was bearing fruit, as drinkers splashed out on the top-shelf stuff.Its Johnnie Walker brand – the world’s bestselling whisky – performed strongly and Diageo had rightly predicted a surge in the popularity of higher-end tequilas, through its Don Julio and Casamigos brands, the latterbought in 2017 from founders including the actor George Clooney.Amid predictions of a “roaring 20s” to match the hedonistic excess of a century earlier, Diageo’s share price peaked at £40 in early 2022 before softening to a still-historically respectable £34 by the time Crew took the helm the following summer.View image in fullscreenThere are signs that weight-loss drugs such as Wegovy and Ozempic are helping people cut down on their drinking, threatening sales.Photograph: ReutersEighteen months later, the stock languishes at £24, a near-30% drop since the change of leadership and a fraction above a seven-year low recorded in July 2024, when it undershot profit expectations.The last time Diageo’s price hit such depths, back in 2017, Crew was in her former job, selling Camels and Lucky Strike as chief executive of US tobacco company Reynolds American.Some investors think the former tobacco boss’s reign may have run out of puff.Last August, Fundsmith, the investment management company run by City veteran Terry Smith, sold its holding in Diageo, a stake it had held since 2010.Smith has since explained the rationale behind the decision to turn his back on a company that had been seen, unusually for a retail brand, as a “defensive” stock, the sort of investment – such as healthcare, pharmaceuticals and utilities – that resists economic downturn.He pinned the blame partly on global trends beyond the company’s control, in particular the rise of weight-loss drugs such as Wegovy and Ozempic. These, he said, had shown signs of effectiveness in helping people cut down on their drinking,threatening global booze sales.But Smith also pointed to “problems with [Diageo’s new management]”, an apparent reference to the company’s handling of its business in Latin America.In November 2023, less than six months into Crew’s tenure, Diageo issued a rare-as-hen’s-teeth profits warning, citing a slump in sales in Latin America and the Caribbean.This was a shock to investors but the slump also appeared to have surprised Diageo’s management.For all of its sophisticated market-monitoring techniques, Diageo had continued to plough supply into Latin America, even as drinkers reined in spending, leaving the region massively overstocked.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The group moved quickly to deny any such move was afoot.Even if Diageo can allay concerns, conditions remain tricky.Vexing trends include younger people eschewing alcohol. While Diageo makes non-alcoholic versions of Guinness and Gordon’s – and bought the non-alcohol spirit Seedlip in 2019 – the vast majority of its income is derived from traditional booze. A telltale graphic from its annual report details where it derives its sales, including categories such as scotch (24%), beer (16%), tequila (11%) and vodka (9%). Non-alcoholic drinks do not even feature on the list.The cost of living crisis has also hit sales in major markets. In the UK,newly introduced changes to alcohol duty will increase the cost to customersof higher-strength spirits – Diageo’s bread and butter.Analysts at AJ Bell point to other headwinds, such as Chinese tariffs on European brandy, Trump’s possible tariffs that could affect scotch exports and a “cooling in the once-red-hot tequila market”.View image in fullscreenDiageo owns Johnnie Walker, the world’s bestselling whisky.Photograph: Dado Ruvić/ReutersThey have even warned that this could be the year that 25 years of unbroken dividend growth, in sterling terms, comes to an end.All of this means Tuesday’s half-year results presentation ranks among the most important in the company’s recent history.Crew has so far declined to drop Menezes’s target set in 2021 of hitting medium-term sales growth of 5% to 7% by some point between 2023 and April 2025.But, with growth coming in at just 1.8% last year, she may be forced to admit it is out of reach.“We believe that 7% is hardly achievable in the medium to long term,” Kai Lehmann, a senior analyst at Flossbach von Storch, a top 20 investor in Diageo, told Reuters last week.Crew appointed a new finance chief last year, Nik Jhangiani, a veteran executive recruited from bottling firm Coca-Cola Enterprises. Analysts at Jefferies describe him as a “heavyweight”.Investors may be prepared to give him – and Crew – a chance to show what they can do.However, any sign of further deterioration and the corporate catchphrase ringing in Crew’s ears might not be Guinness’s paean to patience but Johnnie Walker’s slogan: Keep Walking.Explore more on these topicsDiageoFood & drink industryAlcoholfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Reports have since indicated the Mavericks were unhappy with Dončić’s commitment to conditioning and his physical fitness. Dallas general manager Nico Harrison has said Dončić’s upcoming contract negotiations, as well as Davis’s superior defense also contributed to the trade.In an interview with Arena Sport 1in Dončić’s native Slovenia, his father, Saša, voiced his displeasure with the way the Mavericks had handled the trade.“I understand there comes a moment when you disagree with a certain philosophy,” Saša Dončić said. “You don’t like this or that player, all good – I get it. But I think that exactly this secrecy, or should I say from some individuals, maybe even hypocrisy, this hurts me personally. Because I think that Luka absolutely doesn’t deserve this.”The Mavericks are the only NBA team Dončić has ever played for. His brilliant offense helpedlead the Mavs to the NBA finalslast season, he has five All-NBA First Team selections and is widely acknowledged as one of the best players in the world.Saša Dončić pointed to his son’s performance last season when disputing reports – almost certainly originating from within the Mavericks – about his son’s lack of physical fitness.“[Luka’s conditioning] wasn’t even a problem last year since, I am saying again, one individual said he’s not fit enough,” Sasa Dončić said. “That he played, I don’t know, 100 games – practically 40 minutes with two or three players constantly on him.“That he was beaten, and you say such things about him – I feel that this is very unfair from certain individuals. You traded him, stand by your actions but don’t look for excuses or alibis, that’s it.”Luka Dončić was more measured in his own comments about the trade, although he did omit any mention of the Mavericks organization.“For a young kid from Slovenia coming to the US for the first time, you made North Texas feel like home,” Dončić wrote in a message addressed to the city of Dallas. “In good times and bad, from injuries to the NBA finals, your support never changed. Thank you not only for sharing my joy in our best moments, but also for lifting me up when I needed it most.”While not mentioning the team, he did thank Mavericks fans.“As I start the next part of my basketball journey, I am leaving a city that will always feel like a home away from home. Dallas is a special place, and Mavs fans are special fans,” he wrote.In a separate message, Dončić said he was looking forward to playing for the Lakers. “Grateful for this amazing opportunity,” he wrote. “Basketball means everything to me, and no matter where I play the game, I’ll do so with the same joy, passion and goal – to win championships.”Explore more on these topicsDallas MavericksLos Angeles LakersNBABasketballUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

Tottenham had offered £50m to make a permanent deal happen straight away.Chelsea loan João Félix to Milan and Ben Chilwell to Crystal Palace in late flurryRead moreArsenal, Chelsea and Manchester United had been among the other clubs to look at Tel, who has fallen out of favour at Bayern, making only four starts this season under the manager, Vincent Kompany. But Spurs were able to talk him round, Postecoglou playing a key role, the player and his agent, Gadiri Camara, flying to London before the deadline to finalise the move.Tel fits the profile for Spurs’ project – specifically, that he is young and gifted – and Postecoglou can be relieved at his signing given how hard the club have been hit by injuries in recent weeks, the absentee list regularly running into double digits. Brennan Johnson, Dominic Solanke, Wilson Odobert and Timo Werner are the forwards currently out.The day brought confirmation of Postecoglou’s worst fears in another problem area – central defence – with Radu Dragusin facing a long-term absence with a torn anterior cruciate ligament. The Romanian sustained the damage in theEuropa League win against Elfsborglast Thursday.Spurs hadsigned the centre-half Kevin Dansofrom Lens on Sunday, taking him on loan with an obligation to buy for £20.9m in the summer but the Dragusin setback came on top of the situation with the club’s other specialists in the position – Cristian Romero and Micky van de Ven.Romero’s thigh problem is “tricky”, Postecoglou said, and it is not clear when he will be back, having been out since 8 December. Van de Ven, who injured his hamstring on the same date, made his comeback against Elfsborg, playing the first 45 minutes. But he was left out of the squadthat won at Brentford on Sundayamid fears that something was not quite right.It meant Spurs tried to sign another centre-back but they were unable to persuadeCrystal Palaceto sell Marc Guéhi, despite making an offer of £70m including bonuses. Guéhi, who starred for England during their run to the Euro 2024 final, will be out of contract in 18 months. Newcastle tried to sign him last summer and Chelsea looked at him this month. Liverpool are long-term admirers. Spurs will try again for him in the summer. Spurs also lost out to Aston Villa for the loan signing of the Chelsea central defender Axel Disasi. He simply preferred Villa.Tel’s signing was the boost. He can play across the frontline but is on record as saying his preferred position is as an inside left, where he can cut on to his stronger right foot. The former Rennes player, who is 6ft tall, is known for his good first touch, clever movement and readiness to shoot.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He made only 10 substitute appearances for the club, one of them in the 2-2 Europa Conference League draw against Spurs; his total minutes played was just 81.But Bayern had seen enough, also in his appearances for France at youth level, to pay €28.5m for him. Tel scored six goals in his first season at Bayern; 10 last time out plus six assists. The ability has been there for all to see, sometimes in sustained bursts. But it has simply not happened for him this season, partly because of the intense competition for forward places at Bayern. Hence the openness for a fresh challenge.Explore more on these topicsTransfer windowTottenham HotspurCrystal PalacenewsShareReuse this content"

WhileMLBsaid the investigation did not uncover evidence Hoberg personally bet on baseball or manipulated games, MLB senior vice president of on-field operations Michael Hill recommended in May last year that Hoberg be fired. Commissioner Rob Manfred said Monday he upheld Hill’s decision. Among the highest-rated umpires at judging the strike zone, Hoberg can apply for reinstatement no earlier than 2026 spring training.MLB said the friend made 141 baseball bets between April 2021, and November 2023, totaling almost $214,000 with an overall win of nearly $35,000.“The strict enforcement of Major League Baseball’s rules governing sports betting conduct is a critical component of upholding our most important priority: protecting the integrity of our games for the fans,” Manfred said in a statement. “An extensive investigation revealed no evidence that Mr Hoberg placed bets on baseball directly or that he or anyone else manipulated games in any way.“However, his extremely poor judgment in sharing betting accounts with a professional poker player he had reason to believe bet on baseball and who did, in fact, bet on baseball from the shared accounts, combined with his deletion of messages, creates at minimum the appearance of impropriety that warrants imposing the most severe discipline. Therefore, there is just cause to uphold Mr Hoberg’s termination for failing to conform to high standards of personal conduct and to maintain the integrity of the game of baseball.”Now 38, Hoberg became a professional umpire in 2009, made his big league debut as a call-up in March 2014, and joined the major league staff before the 2017 season. During Game 2 of the 2022 World Series, he had an unprecedented “umpire’s perfect game” by accurately calling balls and strikes on all 129 taken pitches, according to Umpire Scorecards.“I take full responsibility for the errors in judgment that are outlined in today’s statement,” Hoberg said in a statement. “Those errors will always be a source of shame and embarrassment to me. Major League Baseball umpires are held to a high standard of personal conduct, and my own conduct fell short of that standard.“That said, to be clear, I have never and would never bet on baseball in any way, shape, or form. I have never provided, and would never provide, information to anyone for the purpose of betting on baseball. Upholding the integrity of the game has always been of the utmost importance to me. I apologize to Major League Baseball and the entire baseball community for my mistakes. I vow to learn from them and to be a better version of myself moving forward.”Hoberg was notified of his termination on 31 May 2024 for violating Article 9 (A) of the umpires’ collective bargaining agreement, which states the umpire must “conform to high standards of personal conduct; and maintain the integrity of the international game of baseball.” Under the labor contract, Hoberg had the right to appeal Hill’s decision, triggering the hiring by MLB of a neutral fact finder who made a report to Manfred.MLB said the sportsbook notified it that Hoberg opened an account in his name on 30 January last year and an electronic device associated with the account had accessed an account in the name of another person, who had bet on baseball.Hoberg’s devices placed 417 direct bets with Sportsbook A between Decemeber 2020, and January 2024, on the friend’s accounts totaling $487,475.83, which lost $53,189.65 in the aggregate. The devices placed at least 112 bets with Sportsbook B totaling $222,130 that resulted in a loss of $21,686.96 in the aggregate. Most of the direct bets were on football, basketball, hockey and golf.Nineteen of the 141 baseball bets by the friend were made from Hoberg’s home and eight involved five games that Hoberg umpired or was a replay umpire. MLB detailed those games:– On 13 April 2021, Hoberg had three close calls at third base that MLB said he ruled correctly on. There were money line bets of $2,000 and $1,000 on Cincinnati, who lost to San Francisco 7-6.– On 15 June 2021, Hoberg was the lead replay umpire and there were no replay reviews in the Chicago Cubs’ 3-2 loss to the New York Mets. There was a $1,050 bet on a live runs line, a baseball equivalent of a points spread, and the bet won and paid $1,550.– On 15 August 2021, Hoberg was the plate umpire for the Los Angeles Dodgers’ 14-4 win over the Mets and had 98.89% accuracy, missing two pitches that MLB said were in low-leverage situations and benefited Los Angeles. Six calls were in a “buffer zone” and four went against the Dodgers and two against the Mets. A $3,200 money line bet for the Dodgers paid $5,200.– On 8 October 2021, Hoberg was the third base umpire for the Dodgers’ 4-0 loss to San Francisco in an NL Division Series opener and did not have any close calls. A $2,000 money line bet and $3,000 run line bet on the Giants both won and paid a combined $9,300.— 30 October 2021, Hoberg was lead replay official for World Series Game 4. Houston challenged on a possible overslide by Atlanta’s Austin Riley at second base in the sixth inning of the Braves’ 3-2 win and Hoberg upheld the call by Alfonso Márquez, a decision MLB said was supported by its replay operations center staff. Money line bets on Houston of $3,000 and $1,050 on the Astros both lost.“Although the baseball bets were profitable, the data did not support a finding that baseball bets from Individual A’s accounts were connected to game-fixing or other efforts to manipulate any part of any baseball game or event,” MLB said in its findings. “The baseball betting activity did not focus on any particular club, pitcher or umpire, and there was no apparent correlation between bet success and bet size. The eight bets on games Hoberg worked similarly did not reveal any obvious pattern.”After being contacted by MLB investigators, the friend deleted Telegram threads communicating the bets and tracking amounts owed and, after a phone conversation between Hoberg and the friend, the umpire deleted his Telegram account, according to MLB. MLB said Hoberg told it during the investigation and appeal that he had been unaware of his friend’s baseball bets.“If our union believed that an umpire bet on baseball, we would never defend him,” the Major League Umpires Association said in a statement. “But as today’s statement from the league makes clear, the neutral fact finder did not find that Pat placed bets on baseball. Yet we respect Pat’s unequivocal acceptance of responsibility for the mistakes that led to his termination.”Explore more on these topicsMLBBaseballGamblingUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

The goal was never to go from Cleveland to Canton, it has always been to compete for and win a Super Bowl. With that in mind, I have a requested to be traded from the Cleveland Browns.”The Browns selected Garrett with the No 1 overall pick in the 2017 draft and he has delivered on his potential, developing into a hugely disruptive force at defensive end who is now the Browns’ all-time leader in sacks. He is also a four-time first-team All Pro, a six-time Pro Bowler and was named defensive player of the year in 2023.However, the Browns have mostly failed to surround him with a capable team. In the eight seasons since Garrett was drafted, the Browns have reached the playoffs just twice, never progressing beyond the divisional round. In his first season the Browns lost all 16 of their games; In 2024, they went 3-14. They have also struggled since awarding quarterback Deshaun Watson a record contract after landing him in a trade with the Houston Texans. Watson’s tenure has beentroubled by poor play, controversies overallegations of sexual assaultanda series of injuries.The 29-year-old’s request comes despite Browns general manager Andrew Berry saying he would not consider trading Garrett this offseason.

The striker signed a three-year deal with KC that will make him one of the club’s three allotted designated players after he initially came to the league via the U-22 initiative.McGlynn, 21, made 108 appearances in the regular season and postseason for the Union since 2021 and tallied seven goals and 15 assists. He made his first two appearances for the senior US men’s national team earlier this year, scoring and assisting on his debut in a friendly against Venezuela.“Jack is one of the bright, young American talents in both MLS and the U.S. national team player pool, and we look forward to his continued development in Houston,” said Pat Onstad, the Dynamo’s president of soccer. “We expect him to thrive in our possession-oriented style of play, as Jack’s strengths match the attributes that we value in our central midfielders.“In 2024, McGlynn had a career high of 30 appearances and 25 starts for Philadelphia.

Flex seems like a nice bloke. He’s clearly well informed on players and clubs. He seems to genuinely care about this stuff.On this occasion, however, he was thrown a genuine hospital pass, asked to stand next to a vast picture of Marcus Rashford’s head and talk about, well, basically, the entity that isMarcus Rashford. What is it? Is it good? What can it do? What do you think, Flex, about all this? Basically, Flex, just say Marcus Rashford words.Rashford unlikely to play for Manchester United again even if Amorim goesRead moreAt which point Flex found himself stuck in a kind of semantic logjam, reduced to repeating the words “Marcus Rashford” over and over again, at one point 10 times in a minute, eyes a little wide, saying things like: “Marcus Rashford has to do what’s best for Marcus Rashford if Marcus Rashford feels Marcus Rashford can still contribute to what Marcus Rashford wants now for Marcus Rashford.”This is not a criticism. Flex nailed it. He got out of there in one piece. It was in many ways an entirely logical response. Rashford’s late‑breaking move toAston Villahad yet to appear in the treeline. What else are you supposed to say about someone who is essentially just content, a brand, algorithm fodder?There is a kind of trap here, Flex’s Conundrum, which states that it is impossible to discuss Rashford properly because he doesn’t really play much football and isn’t that interesting when he does; at the same time it is also impossible to stop discussing him because he’s Marcus Rashford.This is what the digital noise‑world has given us. Andy Warhol defined a good photograph as one that’s in focus and of a famous person. Maybe a good modern football discussion is one that’s about a famous person, where that famous person’s name is clearly enunciated at least 10 times.In this sense Rashford is arguably the best example of a post-truth footballer. What we have here is a superstar without superstar achievements, superstar numbers or, let’s face it, superstar talent. But who is nonetheless a superstar all the same. His public existence is an extraordinary thing in an extraordinary time, when every act, every close-up, every twitch is spun out, pored over, given meaning, processed across every platform.This is not really how humans are supposed to exist, or what sport is supposed to be. Little wonder it is hard against this backdrop to assess exactly what a loan move to Aston Villa means, or how it’s likely to work out.View image in fullscreenMarcus Rashford was both popular and unpopular with Manchester United fans.Photograph: Martin Rickett/PAThe optics of Rashford’s unveiling video weren’t exactly promising. “I can’t wait for the first training session,” he said, looking heartbreakingly glum. “The sense of ambition is what is attractive,” he added later, with all the uncontainable excitement of a man discussing the slow and painful death of his beloved pet rabbit.And yet this is clearly the right thing for Rashford, if only because he just had to get out of Old Trafford before he was swallowed entirely by the machine.A move to Villarepresents clear lines. Unai Emery is a pragmatist. This is his show. There is no homegrown superstar mythology to muddy the epicure.Rashford will be asked to train and play with good footballers under a coherent coaching system, and to play in a defined role. What he has here is a clear matrix of success or failure, with numbered instructions on how to get there. Plus the chance to find out some things that sound disarmingly basic, from what is his actual position right down to how much does he actually want to do this.Is it a good thing for Villa? As a loan move the risks are relatively low. As are the potential rewards on the face of it. Villa have signed a player with three assists in his past 48 Premier League games, whose Emery-facing metrics – interceptions, tackles, indications of labour, effort, team play – are all way down. But this is also part of the fascination. It brings us back to the most basic question of all. Is he actually any good?It is a question that seems uniquely hard to ask, let alone answer. In part because Rashford is so popular (and also unpopular) with Manchester United fans; because he has a machinery of extreme celebrity at his back; and because of the unavoidable political sensitivities around a footballer who hasfought some vital battlesvia his social media channels.One thing bleeds into another. Even asking if Rashford is actually any good can feel a bit like announcing that you also run an inflammatory alt-right YouTube channel called Why Enoch Was Right About The Great Chem-Trail Vaccination Steal.But it is a fascinating question in its own right. If only because no other footballer presents such an obvious mismatch between celebrity status and on-field performance. That fame premium is clearly visible. Rashford is the fourth-highest-paid player in the Premier League, up there with Mohamed Salah, Kevin De Bruyne and Erling Haaland. Why? Even Casemiro, also in that company, has been world-class in the past.Whereas Rashford’s record is decent but not elite. In the Premier League he has 87 goals in 287 games, 40 assists across nine years, the same number as Jermaine Pennant, fewer than Brian Deane, Chris Brunt and Steed Malbranque. His supporters, fans, entourage, have taken to fudging this by saying, well, at his best he did have a 30-goal season. But did he?skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Either side he’s a 10-a-season man, unable to string together two good years. It used to be easy to see things like this, to allow people simply to be quite good but not great.Rashford is a talented player with excellent movement, when he actually moves, and eye-catching skills. But he’s also not as good as Cole Palmer, Harry Kane, Ollie Watkins, Jude Bellingham, Phil Foden, Anthony Gordon, Morgan Rogers, Eberechi Eze, Dominic Solanke. He’s not as good as Bryan Mbeumo, Cody Gakpo and various other less famous people there’s no space to list here.And yet Rashford is the conversation every time, to the extent he will now routinely complain about being the conversation, while failing to acknowledge that being undeservedly the conversation is also why he earns so much money, is so famous, and has an A-list career.This is a new phenomenon, the interference of fame in the internal metrics of sporting merit. It can also cause problems. In this respect Rashford is an example of something else, too: the Negative Value Player. There is value in having him. But there is value in not having him too, in not carrying all that noise.Rashford signing for Villa is good news for Arsenal, who were never interested enough and have two domestic loans already. It’s good news for Paris Saint-Germain, who have built a much-fanfared new identity around jettisoning the fame‑over‑substance footballer.Mainly it’s a great move forRuben Amorim, who has found himself caught early on by a process that gets its hooks into all United managers now, the urge to go to war with one of their own players, convinced that if they can just weed out Idle Star X, this might all suddenly start to work.This is football’s version of the Pardoner’s Tale, in which a group of drunken men decide the only way to escape death is to find death, who they have become convinced is an actual person, and to kill him, not realising this is impossible and they will naturally die in the process.Erik ten Hag’s death, his Rashford, was Cristiano Ronaldo. Getting rid of a 37-year-old celebrity poacher wasn’t going to solve the wonky structures that led to a 37‑year‑old celebrity poacher being in your team in the first place. But Ten Hag still had to fight that battle just as Amorim had to fight this one. If only because he seemed stuck at this first obstacle, unable to talk about anything else in his press conference, was becoming, like Flex, a man who says “Marcus Rashford” for a living.View image in fullscreenMainly this is a great move for Ruben Amorim, who went to war with one of United’s own.Photograph: Dave Thompson/APWho knows where this will end? Maybe when enough managers have fallen, enough idle senior players been slayed, death will finally be satisfied. But it is also important to remember Rashford didn’t make any of this happen, that theManchester UnitedEffect was inflicted on him too.Rashford was overplayed, overhyped, over-anointed as a very young man. His physical grace, his basic skills, his star power were misleading. He looked ready, but wasn’t ready. He never had time to grow, was expected to be The One right from the start, and did his best to keep running from there to here, as managers, teammates, systems, regimes came and went. A saner club and a saner surrounding industry would surely have made a better Rashford.There is still plenty of hope here. Villa are a great club, Emery an excellent manager. Rashford is talented enough to make this work. It will require discipline, hunger and a degree of personal and professional development. But he deserves a chance to find out how good he is; and above all a chance to be happy, nine years into one of the stranger sporting lives.Explore more on these topicsMarcus RashfordManchester UnitedRuben AmorimAston VillaTransfer windowanalysisShareReuse this content"

But do Americans care?The Star-Spangled Banner has been heartily jeered north of the border after Donald Trump announced tariffs. Similar protests have happened beforeColin HorganMon 3 Feb 2025 10.07 ESTLast modified on Mon 3 Feb 2025 12.03 ESTShareIt’s not as if national anthems are the only way of telling that many pro sports leagues straddle the border between Canada and the US. The line can’t be ignored. There’s an exchange rate, for one thing, as well as different tax rates. There are cultural differences, too, if slight, but present enough that in some cases, pro playerseschew Canadian teamsin favour of American ones (it’s rarely the other way around). The border is always there. Still, on any given game day, it could be ignored. It could just be about the sport. If it weren’t for the anthems.Toronto Raptors fans boo US national anthem after Donald Trump tariffsRead moreTo be clear, they don’t always play both anthems, except in places like Buffalo, where hockey fans listen to OCanadaeven when the city’s NHL team, the Sabres, are facing another American team. Generally, it’s only if a US team are facing a Canadian team that they play both anthems. And you have to stand there and listen. And you are meant to reflect, not on the team you’ve come to watch, but on that other one, Canada and the United States. That’s where the trouble starts.Because when one of your neighbours announces, with specious reasoning, says that they’llstart charging a 25% tariffon the goods you send over that border, and you have to stand in that arena, hat in hand or over heart, and sing their song, it gets tricky to see the point of it all. This is why, as America’s tariffs loomed in sight over the weekend, Canadian sports fans inOttawa,Vancouver,Calgary, andTorontodecided that they’drather boo the US anthemthan just stand silently as it was projected heartily through the loudspeakers during the pre-game. They had come to watch NBA and NHL games and were suddenly reminded of the world beyond the rink, of the trouble brewing beyond the court. The invisible line suddenly came into view.It’s not the first time this has happened, of course – the booing, that is. The two anthems have been sung prior to pro sports games for decades; they began as a gesture of solidarity for the troops fighting alongside one another overseas during the second world war. Eventually, the practice was codified and the anthems became a fixture. It was meant to be – and still often is – a sign of an enduring friendship between neighbours. But no friendship is perfect, and interrupting or otherwise denigrating the anthem became nearly as ritualized as the singing itself.For example, back in March 2003, as the US began its invasion of Iraq (without Canada, who declined on the grounds that the move wasn’t sanctioned by the UN), the Montreal Canadiens hosted the New York Islanders. About 200,000 people had marched through Montreal earlier that day to protest against the invasion, so perhaps it’s not surprising that an arena announcement asking that fans “support and respect the nations represented,” was ignored. As the Star-Spangled Banner began,so did the boos. “I don’t think a sporting event is the place to do it – to boo a sacred song that deserves a lot of respect,” the Islanders’ goaltender, American-born Rick DiPietro,told the Globe and Mail. “To boo it at a hockey game isn’t the right thing to do.”Yes and no. Whether it’s the right action is debatable. But as to whether it’s the right place – well, where else can you do it? Anthems act as space into which national sentiments can be projected, including the sentiments felt by other nations.Later this month, the anthems in Montreal will once again be in focus. The NHL-sanctioned Four Nations Face-Off tournament will see Canada and the US play each other. The two senior national teams haven’t met in this kind of forum since 2016, and even then it was with an asterisk, as that year the under-23s from both nations played together as Team North America. By Saturday, a week will have passed since the US-imposed tariffs were announced. A week of tensions. A week of Canadians wondering why their closest neighbour and best friend has suddenly turned on them. Maybe the anthems won’t seem like they’re worth playing at all that night, or for a while.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But some also get more opportunities than others.Luck can take many forms. It can be a fortuitous bounce, particularly with an oblong-ish football that can go any direction after a punt or a fumble hits the ground. It can be an opponent’s baffling, uncharacteristic mistake. And it can be officiating decisions that are 50-50 calls – or just plain wrong.Consider theKansas City Chiefs, who are headed to the Super Bowl for a third year in succession. The popular opinion on social media these days is that NFL officials have felt pressure to get Taylor Swift to the Super Bowl; therefore, they give the Chiefs a lot of dubious decisions.Allen v Jackson for MVP and a breathtaking play: NFL end of season awardsRead moreThat’s a far-fetched conspiracy theory, but it’s hard to deny that the Chiefs have been a rather fortunate team this year. They’ve benefited from close but correct decisions like thepass interference callthat set up their game-winning field goal against Cincinnati orthe nullified Baltimore touchdownin which Isaiah Likely’s toe was maybe an inch out of bounds. (On the play before that, they were fortunate that Lamar Jackson missed a wide-open Zay Flowers in the end zone.)Then, in the AFC Championship, refereeslooked to have botched the spoton a quarterback sneak by Buffalo’s Josh Allen, costing the Bills possession of the ball at a crucial time, and Kansas City’s Xavier Worthy was credited with a catch in atruly benevolent piece of workby the officiating crew.A few bizarre plays went the Chiefs’ way as well. They beat the Raiders when Las Vegasprematurely snapped the ball, leading to a fumble that stopped a potential game-winning drive. Theyblocked a field goal attemptas time expired to beat the Broncos. Their third-string kickerdoinked a field goalthrough the goalposts as time expired to beat the Chargers.But the Chiefs aren’t the only team to win several games this year on doinked field goals, last-second plays or inexplicable errors by their opponents. Consider the Washington Commanders.On 27 October, the Chicago Bears had all but finished off the Commanders. The Bears were going to move to 5-2 on the season, gathering momentum for a playoff push with exciting rookie quarterback Caleb Williams. The Commanders were going to fall to 5-3.Chicago cornerback Tyrique Stevenson was so confident in the win that he turned his back to the snap,taunting Commanders fansas Washington’s own rookie QB, Jayden Daniels, started to scramble and buy time for a Hail Mary. Daniels’ throw landed in a mass of players just short of the goalline. Stevenson out-leaped the crowd and got his hand to the ball, but he only managed to tip it ahead to Washington wide receiver Noah Brown, who barely had to move to make the easy touchdown catch. After the loss, the Bears’ season completely fell apart – they went without a win until the last game of the season to wind up 5-12, changing head coaches along the way.For the Commanders, this was just one ofsevengames they won in which they clinched the game in the last six seconds. A walk-off field goal against the Giants. An unsuccessful walk-off two-point conversion by the Saints. Touchdowns in the final seconds against the Eagles and Cowboys. An overtime walk-off touchdown against the Falcons. The most recent was their first playoff game, when Zane Gonzalez’s field-goal attempt doinked off one post and went through as time expired against Tampa Bay. The team’s luck ran out against Philadelphia, when a succession of turnovers and penalties turned a somewhat competitive game into a rout.Contrast this run of good fortune – and, to be sure, heroic plays – with the misfortune of the Baltimore Ravens. If not for their loss to Kansas City, the Ravens would have hosted their playoff game against the Bills because Baltimore won the head-to-head matchup earlier in the season. Instead, the Ravenstraveled to frigid Buffalo. Jackson led the Ravens down the field to score and pull within two points with 1:33 remaining. The two-point conversion was a superbly designed play in which Jackson just needed to complete a simple pass to three-time Pro Bowler Mark Andrews to tie the game.Nine times out of 10, Andrews catches Jackson’s pass. He had a crucial catch to get the Ravens within range for the touchdown. But not this time.Sports journalists, coaches and authors often write about athletic victories as a triumph of the best over the not-quite-as-good. What’s often left out from such lionizations is a simple fact: Luck matters.As Seneca said, preparation is part of the equation. All the luck in the world wouldn’t have turned this year’s Cleveland Browns or New York Giants intoSuper Bowlcontenders. And after a trouncing of the Commanders, who had knocked out the Detroit Lions, it’s hard to argue that the Philadelphia Eagles aren’t the best team in the NFC and a truly worthy Super Bowl team. The biggest stroke of luck benefiting the Eagles this season was a poor decision within their division, when the New York Giants threw all their money to gaffe-prone quarterback Daniel Jones instead of running back Saquon Barkley, who signed with the Eagles and would surely win this year’s MVP voting if the league wasn’t obsessed with quarterbacks.But the most accomplished teams and players have all benefited at some point from a fortuitous bounce or lucky positioning, as when Kristine Lilly found herself perfectly placed to get her head up andstop a goal-bound shotthat would’ve won the 1999 Women’s World Cup final for China. Or an opponent’s unlikely miscue, as when Soviet Union goalie Vladimir Tretiak conceded a goal on a bad rebound with one second left in the first period of an Olympic hockey game against the USA, and the Soviets overreacted bypulling Tretiak from the game, setting the stage for the “Miracle on Ice.” Or some other bit of good fortune doled out through the inconsistent karma of the sports world – fan interference, a shift in the wind, a misplaced shot that slices into the goal.Arguably no city inUS sportshas seen the vicissitudes of sports fortune more than Boston. The Red Sox endured “the Curse of the Bambino,” with generations of agonizing near-misses for 86 years after sending Babe Ruth to the Yankees before winning it all in 2004 — after coming back from 0-3 down in the AL Championship series against the Yankees. The Red Sox won the World Series again in 2007, 2013 and 2018.The Red Sox run coincided with the New England Patriots winning six Super Bowls in the 2000s and 2010s, a run that was kickstarted in theinfamous “Tuck Rule” gamein which an obscure rule prolonged a game-tying drive by the Patriots’ backup quarterback, a sixth-round draft pick named Tom Brady.In the NBA, the Boston Celtics’ dynasty years featured a succession of the game’s greats from Bill Russell to Larry Bird. They also often got a few favorable calls, especially when coach Red Auerbach patrolled the sidelines to “work the refs,” and the ball often took mysterious bounces on the team’s unusual parquet floor. But the Celtics have also dealt with tragedy that goes well beyond wins and losses, with draft pick Len Bias and star player Reggie Lewis each dying suddenly, seven years apart.We’re now in an era of analytics, when every player’s physical and mental attributes are mapped in excruciatingly precise detail. But all these analytics can tell you is a probability. Pitcher A might get Batter B out 80% of the time. Jackson might complete a particular pass 70% of the time. Academic studies havequantified home advantageand the effect it has on referees.Brilliant players like Daniels and Patrick Mahomes can improve those odds. If the Chiefs didn’t have top-tier offensive talent and a savvy veteran coach in Andy Reid, no lucky bounces or strange calls would help them win their division nine straight years and reach the Super Bowl five out of six years.But even if the odds are with a team or against it, every play is a roll of the dice. And even the best players and teams need a lucky roll every now and then.Explore more on these topicsSuper BowlKansas City ChiefsNFLUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

West Ham, who played well and edged in front when Jarrod Bowen punished an error from Levi Colwill, had the meagre consolation of knowing they had given rivals with greater resources a scare.This was not convincing fromChelsea, even if they rose into the top four thanks to an equaliser from the excellent Pedro Neto and a Cole Palmer-inspired own goal from Aaron Wan-Bissaka. Enzo Maresca’s team were pallid for long spells and irritation was rising before a sudden surge overwhelmed an injury‑hit West Ham, who still summoned sufficient effort to rally and almost force an equaliser when Tosin Adarabioyo thwarted Mohammed Kudus in added time.Chelsea loan João Félix to Milan and Ben Chilwell to Crystal Palace in late flurryRead more“I was very happy because I consider tonight the toughest game mentally,” said Maresca, who was surprised to hear this was the first time since 2013 that Chelsea had won a home game after trailing at half-time. “You need to be patient. We conceded from our mistake. That’s when you need to be mentally strong. Second half we found more space and the guys from the bench were very good.”Perhaps the closure of the transfer window will restore calm to Chelsea, quietening the noise around their squad. There has been a weird vibe and deadline day had rolled on with João Félix flying to Milan, a loan in the offing, and Aston Villa agreeing to borrow Axel Disasi for the rest of the season. West Ham, meanwhile, were left counting the cost of two years of botched recruitment.The visitors had a threadbare feel with Lucas Paquetá and Edson Álvarez joining the injured contingent and Evan Ferguson not registered afterjoining on loan from Brighton. There were two full-backs in their back three, two goalkeepers on a light bench and a first start in midfield for Andy Irving, a 24‑year‑old Scot signed without fanfare from SK Austria Klagenfurt last year.West Ham still impressed. There were signs of Potter’s ideas taking hold, and a 3-4-2-1 system restricted Chelsea. Their best opening came from a counterattack which ended with Noni Madueke shooting narrowly wide.Chelsea strained to raise the tempo, with Palmer heavily marked. Marc Cucurella missed with a free header, Enzo Fernández dragged a shot wide, Jadon Sancho curled over and there was concern when Nicolas Jackson went down clutching his hamstring.View image in fullscreenJarrod Bowen’s neat finish gives West Ham the lead three minutes before half-time.Photograph: Dylan Martinez/ReutersWest Ham – short of firepower with Michail Antonio, Crysencio Summerville and Niclas Füllkrug missing – grew in confidence. Kudus threatened and Irving volleyed over. Bowen, leading the line with power and commitment after recovering from a broken foot, had two bites at turning in a corner. Filip Jörgensen denied West Ham’s captain.Jörgensen had received a huge cheer by fans delighted to see him replace Robert Sánchez. The Swedish goalkeeper was not entirely convincing, though, spilling an early cross from Irving. Chelsea, sleepy and vague, were asking for trouble.It was not a surprise when Kudus forced Colwill into a wayward backpass in the 42nd minute. The ball ran to Bowen, who raced clear to caress a lovely shot beyond Jörgensen.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They almost levelled through Palmer, whose free-kick drew a stunning save from Alphonse Areola, but they needed more intensity in the second half. West Ham had more to offer than a relentless supply of ironic chants about Irving from the away end.Maresca soon put Neto on for the ineffective Sancho and introduced Marc Guiu for Jackson, who has gone eight games without a goal. Potter, meanwhile, was restrained on the touchline. It was left to Bruno Saltor, Chelsea’s interim coach for one game after Potter’s sacking, to complain about Colwill tripping Bowen in the buildup to the equaliser. “We feel it was a foul on Jarrod,” Potter said. “If we could have held out longer we could have sustained something.”The mood turned when Chelsea levelled. Neto crossed from the right, Cucurella turned the ball back and Fernández’s shot was blocked. Neto, hungry and alert, arrived to score. West Ham, hoping in vain that a VAR check would rule Guiu had touched the ball before it reached an offside Cucurella, geared up for a siege.Neto’s dynamism made an impact. Scrapping hard with Bowen, he won possession before Chelsea went ahead. The ball came to Palmer, he swerved past Tomas Soucek and his cross went in off Wan-Bissaka.West Ham brought on three inexperienced teenagers: Luis Guilherme, Oliver Scarles and Lewis Orford. Chelsea were invigorated by the £60m Neto and the France forward Christopher Nkunku. Even so there was concern at the state of Jackson’s hamstring and Guiu limping down the tunnel at full-time. Maresca hoped both forwards were fine but he has work to do.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueChelseaWest Ham Unitedmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

City were reluctant to pay the full amount but it is thought the club structured the transfer to source the fee over several instalments, with the Spanish midfielder signing a four‑and-a-half-year contract at the Etihad Stadium.Arsenal’s rout of Manchester City shows how great empires end | Jonathan WilsonRead moreGonzález said: “This is the perfect opportunity for me at this stage of my career. I am 23 and I want to test myself in England. There’s no better club than Manchester City for me to do that. Look at the squad they have here … it’s unbelievable, full of world‑class players. There isn’t a footballer in the world who would not want to be part of this setup.“I know the reputation Pep has and I cannot wait to work with him. In fact, I am honoured he wants me to play in his team. I am truly excited. I just want to meet my teammates, and the staff here and then I want to play in front of the City fans.”Txiki Begiristain, City’s director of football, said: “Nico is a very ­talented young midfielder. He is an ideal acquisition for Manchester City.”González bolsters Pep ­Guardiola’s options and adds depth to the mana­ger’s squad as he can operate as a defensive, central or attacking player. After Rodri’s season-ending knee injury the manager had been light in midfield, having been able to call on Mateo Kovacic and Matheus Nunes, the veterans Ilkay Gündogan and Kevin De Bruyne, plus the utility player Rico Lewis, whom Guardiola has fielded centrally on occasion.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Boro’s manager must have wished he had signed the former Leicester striker in time to play here but, initially, Iheanacho seemed almost surplus to requirements.An apparently discombobulated Sunderland swiftly found themselves behind when Hackney’s beautifully calibrated through pass prefaced Delano Burgzorg accelerating clear. All that remained was for ­Burgzorg to send a right-foot shot whizzing low, and unerringly, beyond the visiting keeper’s reach after proving impervious to Luke O’Nien’s des­perate last‑ditch tug on his shirt.If it was easy to see why Boro rejected a £10m bid from Porto for Hackney on Monday, the 2,200 Sunderland supporters who had made the 30‑mile trip down the A19 were distinctly unimpressed with their side’s defending in the face of Boro’s pace suffused attacking.View image in fullscreenSunderland’s Enzo Le Fée’s skills were on display at the Riverside.Photograph: Greig Cowie/Shutterstock“It was an intense game against a strong team and we needed to play with more passion and confidence,” Le Bris said. “But we have Enzo Le Fée and he is so talented. He helped us show we could take control and ­create chances.”Le Bris had reason to be grateful when Marcus Forss spurned an excellent opportunity to double Boro’s lead after collecting another defence‑confounding pass from Hackney.It proved costly as Dan Neil quickly equalised. The midfielder has caught the eye of Premier League clubs in recent months and demonstrated precisely why when he dispossessed Burgzorg before powering in a shot from just outside the area. Admittedly an element of luck was involved – the ball took a significant deflection off George Edmundson’s chest, wrong-footed Mark Travers – but, not for the first time, Sunderland had demonstrated resolve and resilience under pressure.Almost incrementally Le Bris’s side worked their way back into things and, suddenly, a previously omnipotent Boro looked desperate to slow things down. At this juncture Carrick was presumably relieved that the 19‑year‑old Liverpool forward Jayden Danns had not signed his loan deal with the Wearside club early enough to be involved.Boro had originally been all kaleidoscopic positional interchanging and a blur of intelligent passing and movement but by half-time they seemed almost cowed by Le Fée and co. Significantly it appeared Sunderland had fathomed a way to beat Carrick’s hitherto super efficient press.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

When the French striker shaped to shoot, the goalkeeper fell for the deception and, having committed himself, was left to watch in horror as Isidor promptly rounded him before nonchalantly flicking the ball into the empty net.The moment had arrived for the Redcar‑born Hackney to remind everyone he can play a bit too by ­equalising courtesy of the crispest of shots from the edge of the area after Aidan Morris’s interception of O’Nien’s slapdash pass to Jobe Bellingham.Unfortunately for Carrick, Le Fée simply refused to be upstaged and, confronted by his adhesive first touch and high‑calibre cross poor Giles got his feet in a game-changing tangle.“It’s a horrible way to lose a game,” Carrick said. “We started ever so well so it’s a tough one to take. It’s harsh, a cruel finish. I’m bitterly disappointed.”Explore more on these topicsChampionshipMiddlesbroughSunderlandmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Arsenal trail 2-0 fromthe first legbut intend to channel the emotion of a statement victory against City, which took in crowing at the discomfort of their rivals – especially that of Erling Haaland.The City striker angered Arsenal afterthe 2-2 drawbetween the clubs at the Etihad Stadium last September when he clashed with Gabriel Magalhães and Myles Lewis-Skelly – and told Mikel Arteta to “stay humble”. So we saw Gabriel screaming in Haaland’s face after Arsenal had put the ball in the City net. We saw Lewis-Skellymimic Haaland’s “Zen” celebrationafter he scored for 3-1, and caption an Instagram picture of the pose with: “Keep it humble.” And we heard the Emirates Stadium song selector play out at full-time with Kendrick Lamar’s Humble.Premier League: 10 talking points from the weekend’s actionRead moreMartinelli was calm and genuinely humble as the dust settled. TheArsenalwinger made the point, as his teammate Declan Rice had done, that Lewis-Skelly “for sure, respects Erling a lot”. And yet the conviction was unmistakably there. The win over City extended Arsenal’s unbeaten run in the league to 14 games and was surely one of the most significant of Arteta’s tenure.“We know our qualities,” Martinelli said. “It’s not because we lost 2-0 to Newcastle in the last game – we are going to go there just to play now. We are going to go there to win the game and to score three, four, five. Let’s see. It is going to be another battle and we know how difficult it is to play there. But we have an amazing team and we trust ourselves. We have full confidence in our squad.”Haaland was never going to stay silent in the face of everything thrown at him, even if he kept a lid on his celebrations when he equalised for 1-1. After the match, he showed Gabriel the gold champions badge on the sleeve of his shirt. Haaland’s father, Alfie, would mock Arsenal’s lack of silverware under Arteta, posting on Instagram: “This team that wins everything. Ehhhhh, not.” Arsenal have won one major trophy under Arteta – the 2020 FA Cup – which adds to the pressure on the Newcastle tie.Martinelli was asked about the increasingly bitter rivalry with City. “That’s two teams that want to win the championship, so that’s a fight,” he said. “We tried our best, they tried their best. We have to win duels to win these games and that’s why the game becomes hard work.”Explore more on these topicsArsenalNewcastle UnitedCarabao CupnewsShareReuse this content"

The difference between triumph and disaster was a fine line painted white and a goalkeeper in green. Leganés were suddenly, unexpectedly lifted up and handed a lifeline, only to be knocked down, lifted up, knocked down, lifted up and knocked down again.Rayo Vallecano, meanwhile, were taken on the same journey in the other direction, eventually left standing, celebrating something they couldn’t imagine before and wouldn’t imagine now.“Very mad,” the Rayo striker Sergio Camello called it. All of it: the fact they, the club who have only played European football once and thanks to fair play, had just won 1-0 and were sixth and the way they got there, how close they had been to having it taken away again, everything unfolding so fast feelings couldn’t catch up. “I can still feel the fright,” the manager Iñigo Pérez said. “You play football for years, watch it, even start coaching, and think you’ve seen it all. But this is something that’s never happened to me.” What had happened shouldn’t have, he said, an epic end his team could have avoided, but it was better this way, Augusto Batalla performing a miraculous rescue by saving a last-second penalty.Twice.In truth, the derby hadn’t been great until then. But now it wasbrilliant, VAR helping deliver the drama, a battle saved for the final scene. Rayo were a goal and a man up at Butarque after theLeganéscaptain Sergio González had been sent off and Pathé Ciss had found a way through to score with 12 minutes left, when Camello tried to lob Rayo’s 19th shot over Marko Dmitrovic. Had he scored, it would have been over, but he didn’t. Nor, though, did it seem to matter; this was done. The board had said five minutes more and the clock showed 92.36 – Leganés had 10 men and had only managed four shots, none on target.There wasn’t time for anything but there was time for everything. One last ball was sent forward and, on 93.07, Darko Brasanac went down inside Rayo’s penalty area. At first it looked like a dive and the referee Alejandro Quintero González didn’t give anything. Rayo broke again, Adri Embarba having another shot blocked. But on 93.37, the referee stopped play and put his finger in his ear. The ball had gone out; the game would still be going 11 minutes and four seconds later. Rayo’s goal was about to be in the line of fire for the first time.From the VAR room at Las Rozas, 20km round the M40, they had seen Florian Lejeune’s boot connect with Brasanac and, on 94.04, Quintero González was called to have a look, players surrounding him and pointing as he stood staring at the screen. When at last the referee had seen what they saw, he pointed to the spot. This was it, the opportunity for Leganés to get something: one opportunity, one shot that turned out to be two. Two men 12 metres apart, smiling at each other, laughing, offering a few words, trying not to crack up on the surface, trying not to crack beneath it.

The goalkeeper saved it, the ball coming off his palm, and bouncing up. De la Fuente jumped, headed it down and Valentin Rosier bundled over the line: 1-1. It was 97.20, almost 11pm, and Leganés had done it, “Freed From Desire” blaring over the loudspeaker, limbs everywhere.Batalla, though, had seen someone encroach in the penalty area – “I wasn’t sure but on the bench they confirmed it,” he said – and was encouraging the referee to see it too, everything paused again. In Las Rozas, they were looking at another replay. A minute passed, then another. And then the referee was back at the screen, waving players away, his linesman playing bodyguard. “I tried to stay serene and wait for his judgement,” Pérez said afterwards, “but…”Quick GuideLa Liga resultsShowAtlético Madrid 2-0 Mallorca, Barcelona 1-0 Alavés, Espanyol 1-0 Real Madrid, Getafe 0-0 Sevilla, Leganés 0-1 Rayo Vallecano, Osasuna 2-1 Real Sociedad, Real Betis, Athletic Bilbao, Valencia 2-1 Celta Vigo, Villarreal 5-1 Real ValladolidMondayGirona v Las Palmas (8pm GMT)Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.By the time Quintero González stepped away, the derby was in the 103rd minute. He headed towards the north end, briefly stopped, like a man wondering if he had left the oven on, then started again, ‘No, it’s fine,’ and sent them back to do it all again. Óscar Valentín, Pep Chavarría and Iván Balliu asked for an explanation: there had beentwoplayers in the area, the referee told them, one from each team. Batalla hugged De la Fuente, grinning again, enjoying this, or acting like he was. The striker wiped his mouth and went the other way. So did Batalla, saving the shot, the ball falling to almost exactly the place where Rosier had followed up. This time, forewarned, Chavarría was first to it, hoofing it clear, high into the sky.Leganés had a corner but no time for more. From 93.37 to 104.41, the ball had been moving for four seconds and there had been eight touches: two penalties taken, two penalties saved, one header, one goal that wasn’t, one clearance and a corner, nodded away by Valentín, the whistle already gone. Rayo’s players ran to Batalla, grabbing him by the shirt, embracing him, surrounding him. He wagged his finger, “No, no, no, no, no,”but they weren’t listening, throwing into the air the man who was hero and villain last week and 100% hero now. A headline writer’s gift too: Rayo ‘battle’ for Europe, said Marca, AS and just about everyone else.Six days earlier, Batalla had made a couple of superb stops asRayo’s late comeback defeated Girona, but also sparked a confrontation between between the club’s president, Raúl Martín Presa, and a man that Rayo fans actually like:Míchel I of Vallecas, the former player, coach and local boy that went to Girona but still represents his former club better than anyone. Míchel had said the final minutes had been a little bit “ugly” because of the time wasting. He also said he doesn’t blame Rayo’s coach (who admitted he was uncomfortable with the time wasting), alleging instead that the are orders handed down by a president who is a pariah in his own ground. The battle played out publicly and dominated everything for days.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

And there are a lot of them. No one inprimerahas a better save percentage than Batalla at 77.21%. In Europe only four men are ahead of him.It hasn’t always been easy for the goalkeeper who began an unstable, constantly changing career at River Plate and admitted he needed professional help to handle the pressure. “There’s amachismothat doesn’t allow you to show how you are,” he said. “The typical line is: ‘don’t cry’ and the truth is that destroys; it’s not constructive to not be able to express yourself, to not be able to say how you feel. My great victory now is maintaining balance in good moments and bad; what’s important is that you do what you have to do behind the scenes.” Still a River player, despite last playing for them in 2018, Rayo is the seventh club he’s joined on loan, having been relegated with Granada last year.View image in fullscreenCarlo Ancelotti, the Real Madrid head coach, has suggested that Augusto Batalla may need more potassium in his diet.Photograph: Leonardo Gerzon/NurPhoto/ShutterstockAvoiding that fate was supposed to be the extent of Rayo’s ambitions this season. Instead, Batalla and his teammates are in the form of their lives. “Our target is survival. We will continue to be prudent until the maths say otherwise. Then I might be a little less prudent, but I will never be imprudent,” Pérez said; he also called Rayo’s position “purely anecdotal”, only it’s not. “Europe is for other teams, it’s not for us,” the coach said but it’s his team, the smallest of all, sitting sixth, among the most dynamic, exciting sides in La Liga, acontinuity of the identitythat Pérez embraced whileassistant to Andoni Iraola. A fortnight ago the captain Valentín dared mention Europe. Last week, two late goals from Randy Nteka – as many in three minutes as he had scored in three years – brought victory over Girona. And now they had their third win in four, extending their unbeaten run to eight, thanks to a penalty saved on 97.19 andagainon 104.01, details that can feel like fate falling their way.As emotions unravelled during a weird and wild ending to the other Madrid derby, anything seemed possible. Asked if they could dream, the Rayo midfielder Isi said: “I’ve been dreaming my whole life, so why not?” After all, they had just been shot at twice, unloaded upon from point-blank range and somehow survived,Vincent Vega and Jules Winnfieldstanding there unscathed, wondering how the hell it had happened. The answer was on the line, where Batalla had smiled like a man who knew. “It went well when it could have gone badly,” Pérez said. “We shouldn’t have to depend on Augusto, but I’m happy that we could.”PosTeamPGDPts1Real Madrid2229492Atletico Madrid2223483Barcelona2236454Athletic Bilbao2213415Villarreal2211376Rayo Vallecano222327Osasuna22-4308Mallorca22-9309Real Betis22-32910Girona2102811Real Sociedad22-12812Sevilla22-62813Celta Vigo22-42514Getafe2202415Las Palmas21-82316Leganes22-112317Espanyol22-122318Alaves22-92119Valencia22-151920Valladolid22-3215Explore more on these topicsLa LigaEuropean club footballRayo VallecanoLeganésfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The driver asked them to pay for the cost of cleaning it up but they refused. After this, the driver called the police to complain about their behaviour and drove them to the Twickenham police station – instead of the original destination of Kerr’s home – on the advice of the emergency responder over the phone.On the way to the station, the taxi’s rear window was smashed.Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailPC Stephen Lovell and PC Samuel Limb were in a marked police vehicle driving towards the station and arrived at the same time as the taxi, about 2.20am.They saw broken glass on the road and a taxi parked up as they approached the station. The taxi driver honked his horn to alert the approaching officers.Kerr allegedly climbed out of the broken taxi window before she and Mewis approached the police car. They were taken inside the station while the taxi driver was kept outside.Inside the station, Kerr told Lovell that she thought the pair were being kidnapped before calling the officer “fucking stupid and white”.Speaking to the court, Lovell recalled the events of the night. Upon inspection of the taxi, he said “the bit of plastic that separates the passenger and driver’s seat” looked as if it had been kicked.After taking the pair inside the station, he said he “kept getting interrupted” and called Kerr “quite abusive”. He explained to them that they must pay the taxi driver for the damage they caused to his cab. In response, Lovell said Kerr “showed me her bank account on her phone”.In body-worn camera footage showing the pair visibly intoxicated inside the police station, Kerr claimed the taxi driver was “holding us against our will” and that the pair were being “held hostage in that cab”.Kerr said the taxi driver had been driving around for 20 minutes and “kept stopping and speeding up, stopping and speeding up”. Lovell said what the taxi driver had done, based on their words, did not constitute any offence.The pair claimed they had called the police while in the taxi, and Kerr repeatedly told Lovell to “listen to the recording” but officers said they had no record of the call. Kerr said neither she or her girlfriend, who is American, are from the UK, “so we don’t know the police number”.Kerr claimed they had got through to the police but the operator hung up. She continued to say she would not pay for the damage caused to the taxi, saying: “I’m not paying for some fucking dodgy cunt’s fucking window.”Kerr said: “This is a racial fucking thing. You are believing that guy out the front over £50. Listen to the fucking recording, this stupid cunt wouldn’t let us go.”She also accused the police of believing the taxi driver over “two women” and made multiple references to Sarah Everard,who was kidnapped, raped and murderedby a Metropolitan police officer.Kerr told Lovell to “put your shoes in a female’s shoes. We were trapped for 20 minutes in this guy’s car”.She went on: “You have to understand the emergency that both of us felt. Look at what happened last time when a woman accepted a police officer’s help in Clapham and got raped and killed.”Kerr also said she would “get the Chelsea fucking lawyers on this”. Mewis claimed the pair had told the taxi driver that they would pay him if he stopped, but he kept driving.After Lovell reiterated that they had no record of the pair calling 999, Kerr said: “You guys are stupid and white, you guys are fucking stupid and white.” Kerr then looked up at Lovell and said: “I’m looking you in the eyes, I’m looking you in the eyes, you guys are fucking stupid.”Lovell responded: “Why are you bringing race into this?”Kerr said: “I’m fucking over this shit. This is the world’s fucking problem. Wait on the call, wait on the call, wait on the call.”After these comments, Kerr was arrested for criminal damage and a racially aggravated public order. During her arrest, she told Lovell: “Believe women for once.” The criminal damage charge was dropped after the damage to the taxi was paid for.Grace Forbes, defending Kerr, said: “Nobody disputes the words that were said. But simply saying words, even words like these, does not make you guilty of a criminal offence. Sam Kerr did not feel hostile towards this officer because he is white.“The law is a little more nuanced, a little more human than that,” she added.The trial continues.Explore more on these topicsSam KerrAustralia sportChelsea WomennewsShareReuse this content"

He has maintained that he sought her permission for the kiss.If convicted, Rubiales –who resigned as the federation presidenta month after the incident – could face two and a half years in prison: one year for sexual assault over the forced kiss, and 18 months for allegedly coercing Hermoso to downplay what happened.Guardian Footballer of the Year Jenni Hermoso: glory, adversity and a cause that still burnsRead moreGiving evidence on the first day of the trial before the national court in San Fernando de Henares, near Madrid, Hermoso said she hadnever consented to being kissed by Rubiales, adding that he had not sought her permission to do so.“I didn’t hear or understand any of it at the time,” the 34-year-old player told the court. “The next thing was that he put his hands over my ears and kissed me on the mouth.”Hermoso told people she kissed people on the lips only “when I decide to”, adding that she had been shocked by Rubiales’s actions.“I felt it was totally out of place and I then realised my boss was kissing me, and this shouldn’t happen in any social or workplace setting,” she said. “I felt disrespected. One of the happiest days of my life was tarnished and I think it’s very important for me to say that I never sought, much less expected, that this would happen. I think personally that it was a lack of respect.”Hermoso, who plays for Tigres in Mexico, said she had been called off the bus to the airport after the match and shown a statement that had been drafted on her behalf by the federation, and which was issued in her name later the same day.“I skimmed it and I didn’t want to know exactly what it said,” she told the court. “I knew that I hadn’t written a word of the statement because nobody had asked me about it. It was a statement from me that I’d apparently written in my own words. It said that Luis Rubiales and I were good friends and that it had all happened in the excitement of the moment and that was all there was to it.”The player said the statement made her feel “that I was participating in something I hadn’t done and in which I didn’t want to participate”. She added: “I’ll say it again: never, at any moment, did I look for any of this to happen.”Hermoso said she had not wanted what had happened to overshadow her team’s victory, and that some of them had joked about the kiss until another player told them it was a serious matter.She also said she had wanted to celebrate the triumph, despite what had happened, and had been drinking in the dressing room and on the bus.“I was acting according to my heart at the time; I was enjoying it and I wanted to enjoy it,” she said. “I’d just become a world champion and it was a moment to enjoy it and to eat and drink and to get drunk like any footballer would when they’ve won the World Cup.”1:38'Tarnished the celebration': Luis Rubiales apologises after kissing Jenni Hermoso – videoThe footballer was asked by a prosecutor whether anyone from the federation had come to check on her on the flight home or to apologise for what had happened.“No one,” she replied. “No one came over to me to see how I was doing … No one asked how I was or what was going through my head. I felt totally unprotected by the federation because this should have been my safe place. I was a footballer from their country and their national team and no one asked what had happened or if I needed anything. No one came to say anything to me.”Hermoso told the court her life had changed forever when she arrived back in Madrid and found herself and her family hounded by the media. She alsoreceived death threats.“Obviously, even today, I say that my life changed at that moment,” she said. “I’d spent years fighting to win titles for my team, like the World Cup, but all that’s happened to me means that I just haven’t been able to enjoy any of it from the moment I set foot back in Madrid. I’m a world champion but it seems that, even to this day, my life has been on stand-by. I honestly haven’t been able to live freely.”Rubiales, who denies the charges, has vowed to clear his name. “I believe in the truth and I will do everything in my power to make sure it prevails,” he said when he stepped down as head of the federation.He said that although his family and those close to him had been made to suffer “the effects of an excessive persecution” and “many lies”, he felt the public knew the truth.Also on trial for their suspected roles in putting pressure on Hermoso are the former head coach of the women’s national team Jorge Vilda, the former Spanish football federation sporting director Albert Luque and the federation’s former marketing chief Rubén Rivera. All three deny the charges against them.The trial, which is scheduled to last three weeks, continues.Explore more on these topicsSpainEuropeWomen's footballnewsShareReuse this content"

Having gone to Bournemouthand taken care of businessin a match their own manager suggested could have gone either way but for a couple of iffy decisions, a tight offside and some better finishing from the home side, Liverpool managed to put more distance between themselves and their nearest rivals, only to glance in the rear-view mirror last night to see the green and goofy face of Gunnersaurus looming large.Given their six-point lead with a game in hand, the title still remains very much Liverpool’s to lose. However, it is worth noting that their extra game is against an Everton side that no longer look the pushovers they were while under the stewardship of a different inhabitant of the Jurassic era. What’s more, while the Merseyside derby is being contested in a spirit of blood and thunder under the Goodison Park lights, Arsenal’s players will be chillaxing during their now customary winter break in Dubai. If Liverpool’s bitter Merseyside rivals can do them a favour and Arsenal return from their holidays in a similar state of overpriced Salt Bae steak-fuelled serenity and reinvigoration to last year, Mikel Arteta and his men will certainly back themselves to take the title race right to the wire. Crucially, they still have a league match to play against Liverpool in May.While Arsenal have tended to make heavy weather of quite a few of the wins that have kept them in the hunt thus far, for the final 35 minutes of their shellacking of Manchester City their players yomped about with all the giddy abandon of calves confined to a barn all winter who have just been released into a field. Having paid undue deference to their visitors for almost an hour after being gifted an early lead, it took Erling Haaland’s equaliser to spark them into life and realise that despite being champions, Pep Guardiola’s side are currently a complete shower. “I liked that the team showed a lot of personality and competitiveness,” gushed Mikel Arteta following his side’s demolition of City in a fixture that is becoming one of English football’s more enjoyable needle matches, due in no small part to the retaliatory and genuinely funny trolling of a certain Norwegian by Gabriel, Myles Lewis-Skelly and even the DJ in charge of the Emirates playlist.While Arsenal’s players and fans communed in an atmosphere of genuine joviality and togetherness that you don’t always get at the Emirates, all concerned should keep their eye on the bigger prize. After all, this wasn’t the first, second, third, fourth, fifth or sixth league match City have lost this season – and it’s unlikely to be the last.LIVE ON BIG WEBSITEJoin John Brewin at 8pm GMT for live updates on Chelsea 2-1 West Ham.

I was told my retweeting was not balanced, and insensitive to one side and that many people had complained.”Khawaja, whoscored a double centuryin the match during which Lalor was dumped, posted on Instagram saying the news was “unbelievable”.“Standing up for the people of Gaza is not antisemitic nor does it have anything to do with my Jewish brothers and sisters in Australia but everything to do with the Israeli government and their deplorable actions,” he said. “It has everything to do with justice and human rights.”Lalor was told he would not be part of the coverage on Saturday, the fourth morning of the match,won easily by Australia.“I was asked by station boss Craig Hutchison, who was civil, if I didn’t care that my retweeting of events in Gaza made Jewish people in Melbourne feel unsafe. I said I didn’t want anyone to feel unsafe,” Lalor said.Hutchison issued a statement saying he and Lalor have “different views” of the impact of the writer’s social media activity on the community.“SEN Cricket is a celebration of differences and nationalities and a place where our SEN audience can escape what is an increasingly complex and sometimes triggering world,” he said.“We respect Pete as a journalist and long-time contributor to the game but also acknowledge the fear that many families in our community feel right now, and we also need to respect that.”View image in fullscreenPeter Lalor.Photograph: David Maurice Smith/The GuardianGuardian Australia has sought comment from SEN radio and Hutchison.Khawaja has been vocal in his support for Palestinians.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He deservers better,” the 38-year-old said.Lalor said he had been posting images of the conflict in Gaza because he wanted to draw attention to the “crimes against humanity” committed by the Israeli government and Hamas.He said: “The majority of my retweeted posts have been about the sufferings of Palestinians. The asymmetry of my retweeting reflects what can now surely be seen as the asymmetry of the suffering.”In the post to his subscribers on the Cricket Et Al Substack, the former cricket writer explained his continued posting about the conflict.“I cannot remain quiet when so many innocent people are being slaughtered. I think I am a compassionate person. I believe I would do the same no matter who was responsible for the wholesale slaughter of so many innocent people and the destruction of their cities,” he said.“If anything, this episode is instructive. People with more at stake are forced to be silent for fear of these reprisals. I’m in a more fortunate position and of a more careless disposition.”The second Test begins on Thursday.Explore more on these topicsCricketAustralia cricket teamAustralia sportAustralian medianewsShareReuse this content"

Arsenal, Bayer Leverkusen, Bournemouth, Chelsea, Everton and Tottenham also considered the 20-year-old, who made his professional debut under Potter at Brighton.Ferguson, who has scored once this season, will hope to revive his career at the London Stadium. He is regarded as one of the best young forwards in England and will have the opportunity to play regular football at West Ham.Potter has not pushed for major investment in his squad since replacing Julen Lopetegui as the manager last month. He wants to keep his powder dry for the summer and has held on to funds by bringing back Ward-Prowse. West Ham did not insert a recall option when they loaned the former Southampton midfielder to Forest last summer but the clubs have reached an agreement to bring the arrangement to an early conclusion. Ward-Prowse has been on the fringes at Forest but is an experienced competitor who will boost West Ham’s midfield options.West Ham had a bid turned down for Celtic’s 18-year-old striker Daniel Cummings, who is expected to sign a pre-contract with them for a summer move. They also failed with an attempt to sign the Lorient forward Eli Junior Kroupi, who is likely to join Bournemouth at the end of the season. West Ham were also looking to sign a centre-back.Brightonhave acquired Stefanos Tzimas fromNürnbergfor an undisclosed fee on a contract to 2030 but the Greece Under-21s forward will return to the Bundesliga 2 club for the remainder of the season. Brighton’s coach, Fabian Hürzeler, said: “Stefanos is an exceptional young talent, an out-and-out centre-forward with a natural ability to score goals.”Evertonhave signed attacking midfielder Carlos Alcaraz on loan from Flamengo for the rest of the season, with an option to buy in the summer. The 22-year-old former Southampton player becomes David Moyes’ first signing since his Goodison Park return.“I am ready for any challenge with this beautiful club so that’s why I came and accepted the offer to keep fighting for my dreams,” said the Argentinian. “I want to tell the fans that whenever I wear this shirt, I will give my best, I will give everything I have to take Everton to the top, which is where they deserve to be.”Newcastledefender Lloyd Kelly has joinedJuventuson loan for the rest of the season, with the Italian giants having an obligation to make the deal permanent for around £20m in the summer. The 26-year-old only joined Newcastle on a free transfer last summer.Wolveshave made two deadline-day signings to strengthen their squad, with centre-back Nasser Djiga joining from Red Star Belgrade for £10m and defensive midfielder Marshall Munetsi arriving from Ligue 1 side Reims for a reported £16m fee.Bournemouthspent £10m to sign highly-rated strikerEli Junior Kroupi, who will stay at Lorient on loan until the summer.Ipswichhave signed West Brom goalkeeperAlex Palmerfor an initial £2m fee – potentially rising to £4m with add-ons – and he is likely to compete for the No 1 spot at Portman Road with Aro Muric out of form and Christian Walton injured. The 28-year-old has spent his entire career at the Hawthorns. Teenage defenderSomto Bonifacealso arrives from Chelsea and will join the club’s development squad.In the Championship, promotion contendersBurnleyhave pulled off something of a coup to sign the forward Marcus Edwards on loan fromSportinguntil the end of the season. The 26-year-old knows Burnley’s manager, Scott Parker, from his time in Tottenham’s academy.Middlesbroughhave signed former Leicester striker Kelechi Iheanacho on loan from Sevilla for the rest of the season.

England, meanwhile, began theirSix Nationscampaign with a defeat in Ireland after another ­second-half capitulation last Saturday.Murley endured a mixed day on debut, scoring the opening try before twice attempting to carry the ball out from England’s in-goal area and putting his side under pressure in the process. He did not take part in England’s training session at their ­Bagshot base on Monday and is said to be struggling for the France game. In his likely absence, Ollie ­Sleightholme, Tom Roebuck and Elliot Daly could all come into the side while Freddie Steward could also shift to the wing.“You can’t underestimate how good a player [Dupont] is, but he’s human, he’s like everyone else, you take his legs and he goes down,” ­Freeman said.“It’s all about picking things up nice and early with him, putting him under pressure, and I’m sure like any other player when you put pressure on them they start to leak a few opportunities.“At the end of the day everyone is human, it’s rugby. They’ll have a gameplan, we’ll have a gameplan and we’ll back ours to the moon and back.”Ollie Chessum, who came off the bench against Ireland, is pushing for a start against France. He made his comeback from a long-term knee injury in Leicester’s 80-12 defeat by Toulouse last month – another match in which Dupont starred – and was part of the England side that crashed to a 53-10 defeat the last time France visited Twickenham.View image in fullscreenCadan Murley could miss the weekend’s match due to a foot injury.Photograph: Dan Sheridan/Inpho/ShutterstockAsked how to stop Dupont, ­Chessum said: “I don’t know, if I had the answers then I’d be one of the best paid coaches in the world. I suppose we’ve just got to treat it for what he is.“He’s an excellent player, but we’ve got excellent players in our team as well. We’ll bring our threats, I’m sure he’ll bring what he brings and we’ll see what happens on the weekend. We are playing France, not Toulouse this weekend – it is a different team.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The head coach will be tempted to shift Marcus Smith to full-back and hand a first start to Fin Smith given France’s propensity to kick long.“I play with Fin week in, week out,” Freeman said. “To play with Fin, I know his cues a little bit more, but I’ve been playing with Marcus a lot more now. There are different elements to different games, but ­Marcus runs a lot more and can create ­something out of nothing for you and give you the ball more in space.“They are different players and will bring different attributes of the game alive, and it’s exciting to play with both of them. With Marcus at full‑back, when he gets the ball in a bit more space he’s a bit more dangerous as well. I think it works nicely.”The former captain Jamie George is likely to return for the game against France, after being fast‑tracked back into the squad. The 34-year-old missed England’s training camp in Girona in the buildup to their Dublin defeat with a hamstring injury and was expected to miss the first two matches. He was summoned back into camp on Sunday night, however, and after taking part in Monday’syesterday’s session he is expected to feature in Saturday’s matchday squad.Explore more on these topicsSix Nations 2025England rugby union teamFrance rugby union teamSix NationsRugby unionnewsShareReuse this content"

The England international has a contract at Old Trafford until 2028.Manchester City expect to sign Porto’s Nico González for about £50mRead moreThere remains an outside possibility that Rashford could play again for United in pre-season, should Amorim have departed. Last summer Jadon Sancho and Erik ten Hag, Amorim’s predecessor, reached a rapprochement after their fallout, which led to Sancho playing in warm‑up games. Sancho then joined Chelsea on a season’s loan.Amorim denied that it would be embarrassing for United should Rashford prove prolific for Villa, who confirmed the loan signing of the Paris Saint-Germain forward Marco Asensio on deadline day, and it is understood that there is no call‑back clause in the loan to cover for this eventuality.Rashford, who will wear No 9 for his new side, said the Villa manager, Unai Emery, was a key factor in attracting him to the club. “He’s a top manager and what he’s done for the club since coming in is unbelievable,” he told Villa TV.“It’s their constant ambition which is attractive and why you want to join such a club. You want to keep improving year on year and that’s what the team’s been doing.“They are still in the Champions League and we want to go as far as we can in that and if you don’t aim to win it you’ll never win it, so that will be my main objective and keep pushing in the league to get as high as possible. This is my first time playing for any other team so you don’t know what to expect but it’s been more excitement, not scared of going into a new environment.”Rashford, who could make his debut when Villa meet Spurs in the FA Cup fourth round on Sunday, said: “I had to choose somewhere where my style of football is suited and can help them and help me rediscover and improve as a player. It’s only short‑term and I want to make the most of my time here.”View image in fullscreenMarco Asensio of Aston Villa poses for a picture at Bodymoor Heath training ground.Photograph: Neville Williams/Aston Villa FC/Getty ImagesAsensio, a 29-year-old former Real Madrid player, has been loaned by PSG after a season and a half there. He has started 10 games this season but none since 22 November.Villa were also poised on Monday night to complete the loan signing of the Chelsea centre-back Axel Disasi for the rest of the season.

Chelsea signed Disasi from Monaco for £38m in August 2023. He has slipped out of favour under Enzo Maresca, making just six Premier League appearances this season.United did not move for defensive cover on deadline day despite fears Lisandro Martínez sustained a serious knee injury on Sunday in the 2-0 defeat by Crystal Palace that could rule him out for the season. Reports in his native Argentina said it was an anterior ligament injury. Amorim has the centre-backs Harry Maguire, Matthijs de Ligt, Leny Yoro, Victor Lindelöf, Jonny Evans and Ayden Heaven. Noussair Mazraoui, Diogo Dalot, Luke Shaw and Patrick Dorgu can also play in a back three.The club also did not replace Rashford or Antony, who moved on loan to Real Betis, leaving Amorim with only four frontline forwards: Rasmus Højlund, Joshua Zirkzee, Amad Diallo and Alejandro Garnacho.Despite Dorgu and the 18‑year‑old defender Heaven being the head coach’s sole additions, it is understood United’s football leadership is content with the window’s business.

The 17-year-old’s finish, arced into the bottom corner from that inside-right position through which so many of Arsenal’s attacks had come, felt like the perfect finale toa dominant 5-1 winover reigning Premier League champions Manchester City. And it was, in more ways than one.Its youthful chutzpah seemed an appropriate way to round off a win in which 18-year-old Myles Lewis-Skelly had been the most eye-catching player, having scored the third goal with an impudent shimmy into the box. Yet there was a strange realisation on seeing the replay. Nwaneri’s finish hadn’t nestled in that close to the corner of the goal; it wasn’t quite as good as it had initially appeared. And that felt emblematic of the game as a whole.Of course Arsenal were magnificent – the first team ever to score five against aPep Guardiolaside and win by four or more goals. Of course they deserve enormous credit, particularly given the scars left by the run of 12 successive league defeats to City that culminated with Pep Guardiola’s side effectively sealing the title against Arsenal in April 2023. Of course there was much to admire in their youthful intent. But equally there was a strange feeling that, memorable as Mikel Arteta’s triumph over his mentor was, Arsenal hadn’t needed to be that good to win.Lewis-Skelly strikes a pose as Haaland is riled and Arsenal savour catharsis | Barney RonayRead moreCity had equalised at 1-1 in the second half, and in that moment there was a sense thatArsenalhad allowed them back into the game. Goalkeeper David Raya had already been forced into two fine saves, Kai Havertz had missed a glaring chance and there was a growing feeling that Arsenal’s diffidence might cost them, that they were somehow playing less the City of today than the image of City implanted in their head by those six years of defeat. By the end they were rampant, scoring 105 seconds after City’s equaliser as part of four unanswered goals in the match’s final 37 minutes. Yet their xG for the game was, according to one model, only 1.06. As much as anything else, this was about City’s soft centre, about the way the fight left them entirely.Is this the end? Not just for this season but for the Guardiola project as a whole? There’s a reluctance to call it, if only because City have been so dominant, because they have enjoyed such advantages, because Guardiola has been so obviously the most significant figure in shaping the tactical direction of the game over the past 15 years. Can it really be over? Is that it? Defeat at Tottenham in the Carabao Cup, a month of nonsense, and – boom! – that’s it,no mas?Champions rarely lose so heavily, but Liverpool did in 2020,going down 7-2 at Aston Villa. Although that was a dreadful season for them, including a run of six straight home league defeats, it happened amid the strangeness of the Covid lockdown and Liverpool did ultimately rally to finish third. Generally, the precedents for City are not good: the closest analogy is perhaps Inter, who collapsed in the final weeks of 1966-67. Dominant under Helenio Herrera, who had reshaped the tactical landscape just as surely as Guardiola, they won only two of their final 11 games of the season, losing in a European Cup final and Coppa Italia semi-final and surrendering the league title, and were never quite the same again.Premier League: 10 talking points from the weekend’s actionRead moreAs with City, the sense was of injury and fatigue triggering crisis in a squad that had perhaps grown stale and, once their aura had gone, it turned out they had no way back. City have stabilised to an extent: they had lost just one of their nine fixtures before the capitulation at the Emirates. There had been a sense of normality returning, while the wave of new signings plus Erling Haaland’s new contract had suggested a club girding itself for a rebuild. It was not the calm, gradual process of the past few seasons, an indication of how recruitment had gone awry, but the chaos of November and December was over. Would it perhaps come to be seen as two bizarre, freakish months?Sunday proved it was not. City remain staggeringly open. They make mistakes. They do not press with the precision they used to. Opponents no longer fear them, rather seeing in them an opportunity for a notable result. After Leyton Orient in the FA Cup, they face Real Madrid, Newcastle, Liverpool and Tottenham, who have already beaten them twice this season. This could be another month of misery for City.And what then? Can the rebuild work, or is something too far broken? Guardiola has been a manager at the top of the game for 17 years; few last more than a decade. Does he still have the energy to keep fighting, to keep evolving, to start again? History suggests few come back from seasons like this, that auras once lost are rarely reestablished. Guardiola is close to unique, but restoring City to dominance may be beyond even his abilities.On this dayView image in fullscreenLa Bombonera was the site on a famously auspicious debut.Photograph: Nestor J Beremblum/AlamyYou’re 23, you’ve just moved from Chacarita Juniors to one of the biggest clubs in Argentina and you’re told you’ll be making your debut in the Superclásico for Boca Juniors against River Plate. What do you hope for? Perhaps you’d be happy to simply not make a fool of yourself, to just get through the game with the eyes of the nation upon you? But Carlos María García Cambón got off to the perfect start, seizing on a long ball and smashing his finish past Ubaldo Fillol to give Boca a second-minute lead.But that was only the start of it. By full time on 3 February 1974, Cambón had become the first – and, as yet, the only – player ever to score four in a Superclásico as Boca won 5-2. It was arguably the greatest debut in history. Perhaps inevitably there was a sense of anticlimax after that. Cambón had already won an unlikelyMetropolitanowith Chacarita but he lifted only one furtherMetropolitanoand oneNationalwith Boca and by 1977 he had moved on to Unión de Santa Fe. He wound down his career in Greece with Olympiakos and then in the USA with Rochester Lancers and the Las Vegas Eagles before returning to Argentina with Loma Negra de Olavarría.This is an extract from Soccer with Jonathan Wilson, a weekly look from the Guardian US at the game in Europe and beyond.Subscribe for free here.Have a question for Jonathan?

One of the primary justifications cited in favor of keeping the emails confidential was to protect the identities of clergy-abuse victims. Yet none of more than 700 pages of emails reviewed by the Guardian and reporting partner WWLLouisiananamed any such victims.Here is a look at some of those people present in the so-called Saints emails.US district judge Jay ZaineyView image in fullscreenLike the Saints and Pelicans owner, Gayle Benson, Jay Zainey is a devout Catholic. He has been a judge at New Orleans’ federal courthouse since 2002.He once publiclysaidhe had a chance encounter with New Orleans’ archbishop, Gregory Aymond, after a series of scandals locally and nationally revived the worldwide Catholic church’s clergy-abuse scandal. And during that encounter, he suggested to Aymond that Greg Bensel – the vice-president of communications for Benson’s two professional sports franchises – could help him navigate his messaging about the scandal.Based on the emails and time stamps from them, Zainey would have had to make that entreaty offline before one particular July 2018 newspaper article that was problematic for Aymond was published or very shortly thereafter.The emails establish that Bensel in July 2018 asked Benson to tell Aymond that Bensel wanted to offer crisis communications help to the New Orleans archdiocese. Over the next year, Bensel communicated with Aymond, others at the archdiocese and outside allies with the evident goal of easing critical news media coverage and scrutiny of both the church and its leader.Among the recipients of some of those communications was Zainey, who has publicly described himself as friends with Bensel – and once said he even met with Bensel and Aymond about the clergy-abuse scandal at one point. Zainey in one email credited Bensel for providing “wonderful advice”. He wrote of Aymond: “The Arch[bishop]’s sincerity will open their minds and hearts.” And, in a separate message, Zainey wrote: “By his example and leadership, Archbishop Aymond, our shepherd, will continue to lead our church in the right direction – helping us to learn and to rebuild from the mistakes of the past.”The archdiocese would later file for bankruptcy protection as it grappled with a wave of clergy-abuse lawsuits seeking civil damages for survivors. Zainey was among several judges whorecusedthemselves from presiding over any cases that could directly affect the bankruptcy. But at one point, Zainey did rule in a case involving a Catholic religious order that a 2021 Louisiana law enabling clergy-abuse survivors to seek damages over decades-old child molestation was unconstitutional.Zainey’s ruling was widely interpreted as potentially a decisive – if indirect – win for the archdiocese, which hoped the judge’s decision could let it settle abuse claims tied up in the bankruptcy case for less money than otherwise. But the state supreme court laterupheldthe law that Zainey struck down, in effect negating his ruling.Zainey declined comment for this report.He was nominated for his federal judgeship during George W Bush’s presidency, and the US Senate confirmed him to the post in 2002. Like Lauscha and Bensel, he is also an alum of New Orleans’ Jesuit high school. He furthermore has served on the governing board of the New Orleans archdiocese-run college that educates prospective priests.US district judge Wendy VitterView image in fullscreenWhen the Saints emails began, Wendy Vitter was the general counsel of the archdiocese of New Orleans. She is also the wife of the former Republican US senator David Vitter and had been nominated to serve as a judge at the city’s federal courthouse by Donald Trump in his first presidency.Trump’s appointment of Wendy Vitter was confirmed in 2019 by the congressional chamber which her husband previously served. But before then, she spent at least some of her final months at the archdiocese being copied on emails from Bensel about the media messaging campaign that he was helping devise.One of the times Vitter emailed Bensel was to share her excitement about aSaints victory in Baltimoreless than two weeks before he helped the archdiocese publish a list of credibly accused clergy abusers who had worked locally. “WHAT A GAME!!” she wrote to Bensel, who had traveled to the game as part of his Saints duties. “Congratulations!”“Amazing win, was fun (cold and windy, too),” Bensel replied.An email from Bensel to Vitter a little more than a month after the list came out said he was glad that she and her husband had been able to attend a recent Saints game with their family. In that email, Bensel also asked her what the aftermath of the list’s release had been like from her perspective.“I have not wanted to bother the Archbishop, but was just curious … how has the reaction been relative to lawsuits or any other issues that we feared may arise,” Bensel wrote. “It seems as though [publicly] it has been fairly quiet.”It is not clear if Vitter replied. But the number of additional civil lawsuits prompted by the list – marketed as a gesture of contrition and transparency – drove the church into bankruptcy. The church had not managed to resolve the bankruptcy successfully at the time of the publication of this report. If the church ever manages to do that, the case could cost the church hundreds of millions of dollars in payments to clergy-abuse victims.Furthermore, there was evidence uncovered during the bankruptcy that facilitated the prosecution of a serial child molester clergyman who had been shielded by the church for decades.The cleric, 93-year-old Lawrence Hecker,pleaded guiltyin December 2024 to child rape, received a mandatory life sentence and shortly thereafter died. The prosecution of Hecker by New Orleans district attorney Jason Williams’ office then kickstarted a separate Louisiana state police investigation in which troopers alleged that they had probable cause to believe the archdiocese ran achild sex-trafficking ringthat allowed Hecker and other clergymen to inflict sexual abuse on minors for decades – and that church bureaucrats then illicitly covered up those crimes.Vitter did not respond to a message seeking comment.Former New Orleans district attorney Leon CannizzaroView image in fullscreenLeon Cannizzaro– a self-described pious and practicing Catholic as well as former altar boy – had been New Orleans’ district attorney for about a decade when the city’s archdiocese released its clergy-abuser list.On the morning that roster was published, using abbreviations commonly used for “conference call” and “with”, Bensel emailed the Saints and Pelicans president, Dennis Lauscha, hours before the disclosure and said: “Had a cc w Leon Cannizzaro last night that allowed us to take certain people off the list.“This list will get updated, and that is our message that we will not stop here.”Cannizzaro has consistently denied such a conversation took place. When asked by WWL Louisiana in 2020 if he had any input on the contents of the church’s credibly accused list, he said: “No.” Through an email that same year from a spokesperson, Cannizzaro said to an Associated Press reporter that “he was not consulted about the composition of the archdiocese’s ‘credibly accused’ list nor did he or anyone from [his] office have input into its assembly”.Recently, Cannizzaro said in an interview: “I was not on any conference call with anybody from the Saints about this.”The Guardian asked Cannizzaro about a 29 October 2018 typed message informing him of a call from Vitter. Vitter was “following up on conversation you had with Archbishop Aymond”, said the message left for Cannizzaro just four days before the list’s release.“If I was in a conversation with him, I would’ve been looking for any records he would have had relative to complaints made against priests so we could reach out to those victims to see if there was a prosecutable case,” Cannizzaro said.But Cannizzaro insisted: “I did not at any time ask the archdiocese or tell the Saints to tell the archdiocese … ‘remove this name from the list’.“I do not ever remember having a conversation with the Saints about any case going on with our office” at that specific time.On Saturday, a statement from a Saints lawyer also said that no one from the team spoke with Cannizzaro. Instead, the statement said, Bensel’s email to Lauscha referred “to a conversation that he was told had occurred between a member of the staff of the archdiocese and … Cannizzaro, concerning the list” and how it would be updated.A statement from the archdiocese on Saturday echoed the Saints and Cannizzaro in saying “no one from the [team] or the New Orleans district attorney’s office had any role in compiling the [credibly accused] list or had any say in adding or removing anyone from the list”.Cannizzaro’s top assistant district attorney, Graymond Martin, was not impressed with the list when supplied with it. The list lacked some details that Martin considered basic, including the number of accusations against each clergyman as well as the nature of the alleged abuse. Martin drafted a request six days after the roster’s release seeking more information about the listed clergymen, including “when each act … occurred” and “some description of each of the alleged acts”.It is unclear whether the request was formally sent to the archdiocese.Cannizzaro filed charges of child rape against one clergyman on the list before leaving office in 2021. The church had paid settlements totaling more than $3m or so to 16 victims of that clergyman, deaconGeorge Brignac. Brignac, 85, died in 2020 while awaiting trial on charges that dated back to the late 1970s and early 1980s.Unflattering news coverage in July 2018 of an out-of-court $550,000 settlement that the archdiocese paid to the victim in Cannizzaro’s case against Brignac was what prompted Bensel – with Benson’s blessing – to involve the Saints in the church’s clergy-abuse messaging in the first place.Cannizzaro has since become the chief of the criminal cases division at the Louisiana state attorney general’s office.Talkshow host and former sheriff Newell NormandView image in fullscreenNewell Normand was the sheriff of the suburban New Orleans area of Jefferson parish for 10 years beginning in 2007, when helefthis elected office and began a second career as a talkshow host for the local WWL Radio station.The radio station – which is not affiliated with the TV channel WWL Louisiana despite its call letters – has long held the exclusive rights to the Saints’ local broadcasts. And on Normand’s show, the station hosted the one live, on-air interview that Aymond granted the day that the archdiocese published its credibly accused clergy-abuser list.Emails among him, WWL Radio’s station director and archdiocesan officials show Bensel brokered the conversation between Normand and Aymond. And Bensel sent copies to Normand and the station director a list of eight questions for the host to ask Aymond. Bensel called the questions, which were prepared by the archdiocese, “a great framework for Newell”.Normand ended up asking about half of the suggested questions. Aymond answered the rest without being prompted.Normand also asked questions that weren’t provided for him. And in the years since that interview, Normand has used his show to criticize Aymond’s handling of the local Catholic clergy-abuse crisis.A statement on Saturday from the corporation that owns WWL Radio, Audacy, said: “WWL stands by its coverage of this story. We have no additional comment.”Newspaper owner John GeorgesView image in fullscreenProminent local businessman John Georges bought the Baton Rouge-based Advocate in 2013 and expanded the newspaper’s coverage in New Orleans after the Times-Picayune reduced the number of days it delivered printed editions as well as heavily cut newsroom jobs. Heacquiredthe Times-Picayune in May 2019 and consolidated it with the Advocate, which at the time had justwon its first Pulitzer prizefor a series that helped change a law allowing non-unanimous jury verdicts in Louisiana.That ended what was an intense fight over news scoops and commercial business.The Saints emails show both papers – before their consolidation – drew Bensel’s attention as he tried to take some of the edge off their coverage of Aymond’s handling of the local clergy-abuse crisis. He personally implored leaders at both the Times-Picayune and the Advocate to “get behind … and work with” the archbishop.And, at Aymond’s request months after the list went out, Bensel coordinated the writing of an opinion piece in the Advocate – under Benson’s name – that extolled the local church’s efforts to combat sex trafficking along with other ills.One of the clergy-abuse lawsuits that drove the archdiocese into bankruptcy court turned up evidence of some of the communications among the church, Bensel and his Saints colleagues. Plaintiffs’ attorneys then successfully argued that they needed to subpoena all those communications.While the Saints and the church complied with the subpoena, they fought efforts by the media to access copies of them. And when an Advocate reporter now at the Guardian contacted Bensel for possible comment about the subpoena, he sarcastically told the journalist to ask Georges for comment. He also forwarded an email from the reporter seeking comment to Georges.There is no indication in the emails that Georges and Bensel had a discussion after that.Georges, a former Louisiana gubernatorial and New Orleans mayoral candidate, is coincidentally a neighbor of Gayle Benson and has donated some of his wealth to Catholic institutions, according to publicly available information. The Advocate was also printing the archdiocese’s weekly newspaperas of at least 2020.Nonetheless, the merged Times-Picayune and Advocate owned by Georges subsequently joined a coalition of media organizations that sued to access the emails between the Saints and the church. The church bankruptcy essentially prevented that suit from being ruled on.At one point, New Orleans news station WVUE-TVreportedbeing told by an anonymous source that Georges “may have participated in behind the scenes communications involving the archdiocese’s release of credibly accused pedophile priests”.Georges told the station, which had once been owned by Gayle Benson’s late husband, Tom: “Your source is incorrect.“I had no contact with the archdiocese during the period in question.”The Saints emails contain only the message Bensel forwarded to Georges in July 2019, months after the list’s release.A statement from the consolidated Times-Picayune and Advocate said, “No one gets preferential treatment in our coverage of the news. Over the past six years, we have consistently published in-depth stories highlighting the ongoing serious issues surrounding the archdiocese sex abuse crisis, as well as investigative reports on this matter by WWL [Louisiana] and by the Associated Press.” Some of those WWL Louisiana reports were produced in partnership with the Guardian.The newspaper’s statement continued: “As the largest local media company in Louisiana, we often hear from community leaders, and we welcome that engagement, but it does not dilute our journalistic standards or keep us from pursuing the truth.”Explore more on these topicsNew Orleans clergy abuseNew Orleans SaintsNew Orleans PelicansNew OrleansNFLNBAUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

The will also gave key positions in Tom Benson’s estate to the teams’ president, Dennis Lauscha, and top spokesperson, Greg Bensel.The Saints’ proximity to the church spurred protests by clergy-abuse survivors in front of the team’s headquarters and at the offices of one of the oldest Catholic archdioceses in the US.View image in fullscreenMembers of the Survivors Network of Those Abused by Priests outside the New Orleans Saints and Pelicans training facility in Metairie, Louisiana, in 2020.Photograph: Matthew Hinton/APYet what remained hidden until now are more than 300 emails, amounting to more than 700 pages, many emblazoned with the NFL and NBA logos, showing that the teams’ officials were more involved with some of the church’s operations than they ever admitted. They expose how extensively the sports teams’ leaders intervened in their local church’smost unyielding scandal.In the most blatant example of that, Bensel – the teams’ vice-president for communications – wrote an email to Lauscha on 1 November 2018, the day before the clergy-abuse list was released. Using common abbreviations for “conference call” and “with”, Bensel wrote: “Had a cc w [New Orleans’ then district attorney] Leon Cannizzaro last night that allowed us to take certain people off the list.”But the teams said in a 2020 statement: “No one associated with our organizations made recommendations or had input on the individual names of those disclosed on the list.”On Saturday, the team also said: “No Saints employee had any responsibility for adding or removing any names from that list or any supplemental list. Nor did any Saints employee offer any input, suggestions or opinions as to who should be included or omitted from any such lists. Any suggestion that any Saints employee had any role in removing anyone from the archdiocese’s published lists of credibly-accused clergy is categorically false.”Meanwhile, when WWLLouisianaand the Associated Press asked him separately in 2020 if he had any input on the contents of the list, Cannizzaro – a self-described pious, practicing Catholic – denied it.“No,” Cannizzaro told WWL when asked that question. “We simply requested information from them. We requested documents from them, and they provided us documents of people that they believe were responsible for abuse.”Through an email from a spokesperson, Cannizzaro said to an Associated Press reporter that “he was not consulted about the composition of the archdiocese’s ‘credibly accused’ list nor did he or anyone from [his] office have input into its assembly”.Thank you Greg … I am certain [Archbishop Aymond] will appreciate itGayle Benson in a reply to an offer by Greg Bensel to help Aymond with ‘crisis communications’More recently, the Guardian obtained a typed phone message left for Cannizzaro at his office showing the archdiocese contacted him for comment requesting follow up “on conversation you had with Archbishop Aymond”. The date left on the message was 29 October 2018, four days before Aymond released the clergy-abuse list.Cannizzaro, for his part, said he isn’t sure he has ever met Bensel and “did not at any time ask the archdiocese or tell the Saints to tell the archdiocese … ‘remove this name from the list’.”“I would not have done that,” said Cannizzaro, who is now the chief of the criminal cases division at the Louisiana state attorney general’s office. “That’s just not something I would have done.”Another revelation in the emails: the sports franchises took the initiative to protect Aymond’s flagging reputation in the summer of 2018 without his asking for that, before the archbishop announced plans to release the names of dozens of abusive clergymen.Bensel sent an email in July of that year to Gayle Benson asking her to let him help Aymond with “crisis communications”. Benson – who counts Aymond as one of her best personal friends – replied to Bensel that same day: “Thank you Greg … I am certain he will appreciate it.”The pair exchanged those emails the day aftera damaging storyabout a deacon who had repeatedly faced criminal charges of child sexual abuse being allowed to read at masses – triggering one of multiple scandals in 2018 which pressured the church into releasing a list of credibly accused clergymen as a gesture of conciliation and transparency.View image in fullscreenNew Orleans Pelicans and Saints owner Gayle Benson next to the teams’ senior vice-president of communications, Greg Bensel, in New Orleans in 2022.Photograph: Matthew Hinton/APBensonclaimedin 2020 that Bensel only got involved in the local church’s messaging after being “asked if he would help the archdiocese prepare for the media relative to the release of clergy names involved in the abuse scandal”.On Saturday, an attorney for the Saints said Bensel did so in part at the suggestion of New Orleans-based federal judge Jay Zainey, a devout Catholic – who, according to the emails and time stamps from them, would have had to make that entreaty offline before the article on the abusive deacon was published or very shortly thereafter. Zainey has previously publicly acknowledged making such a suggestion, though he declined further comment on Saturday.The team’s attorneys on Saturday also said “other local civic leaders” asked Bensel to assist the archdiocese, though the lawyers did not say exactly when those requests were made.On Saturday, as they have done before, the Saints said Bensel’s role was limited to “public relations assistance provided to the archdiocese of New Orleans … in anticipation of press interest in the publication of a list of clergy who were credibly accused of abuse” on 2 November 2018.Bensel himself at one point wrote in the emails that he was presenting himself “not as the communications person for the Saints/Pelicans but as a parent, New Orleanian and member of the Catholic Church” – as well as a personal friend of Aymond. And the Saints on Saturday emphasized that “no compensation from the archdiocese was expected or received in return for Mr Bensel’s assistance”.But Bensel communicated directly with local media about their coverage of the clergy-abuse crisis using his Saints.NFL.com email address, bearing a signature line displaying two of the most recognizable logos in sports: the NFL’s shield and the NBA’s silhouette of a dribbling ball player. Lauscha and Benson used their Saints.NFL.com email addresses throughout the communications, too.And the emails also show Benson, Lauscha and Bensel continued to coordinate with the archdiocese on how to respond to news stories about the clergy-abuse crisis or other topics involving the organizations’ leaders for at least eight more months beyond the list’s release.On 21 June 2019, Bensel sent an email complaining that he did not “get paid enough” because he had to prepare the archbishop for an upcoming interview with New Orleans’ Advocate newspaper about clergy-abuse lawsuits and their effect on the church’s coffers. The regular email exchanges between team officials and the archdiocese ended only in July 2019, after a subpoena for the communications was issued to the Saints and theNFLby attorneys for clergy-abuse survivors who had detected evidence of them while pressing a lawsuit for damages on behalf of a victim.With the backing of various allies – including Benson, Zainey and future federal judge Wendy Vitter, then the archdiocese’s general counsel – the Saints and Pelicans officials used their influence to lean heavily on prominent figures in the local media establishment, pushing for them to soften their news coverage of Aymond, the emails show.Casting a critical eye on [Aymond] is neither beneficial nor rightGreg Bensel in a July 2018 letter to editors at the Times-Picayune and the Advocate newspapersBensel also sought to convince media outlets to limit their scrutiny of a list that turned out to be so incomplete it eventually precipitated a joint federal and state law enforcement investigation into whetherthe archdiocese spent decades operating a child sex-trafficking ringwhose crimes were illegally covered up.“Casting a critical eye on [Aymond] is neither beneficial nor right,” Bensel wrote in a July 2018 letter to editors at the Times-Picayune and the Advocate, the two daily New Orleans newspapers in existence back then.A year later, when an Advocate reporter emailed Bensel seeking a comment from the Saints and Pelicans about the subpoena issued to them and their powerful leagues, Bensel quickly forwarded it directly to the owner of that newspaper, John Georges, after unsuccessfully, and sarcastically, suggesting the journalist ask Georges for comment instead.The Saints’ officials statement on Saturday did not answer questions about Bensel’s remark to the reporter or his overture to Georges.The statement from the team’s lawyer said “no member of the Saints organization condones or wants to cover up the abuse that occurred in the archdiocese of New Orleans”.Separately, a statement from the Advocate and the Times-Picayune – which Georges has since acquired – said: “No one gets preferential treatment in our coverage of the news. Over the past six years, we have consistently published in-depth stories highlighting the ongoing serious issues surrounding the archdiocese sex abuse crisis, as well as investigative reports on this matter by WWL [Louisiana] and by the Associated Press.”Some of those WWL Louisiana reports the newspaper ran were produced in partnership with the Guardian.The newspapers’ statement said: “As the largest local media company in Louisiana, we often hear from community leaders, and we welcome that engagement, but it does not dilute our journalistic standards or keep us from pursuing the truth.”A statement from the archdiocese on Saturday echoed the Saints and Cannizzaro in saying “no one from the [team] or the New Orleans district attorney’s office had any role in compiling the [credibly accused] list or had any say in adding or removing anyone from the list”. It also characterized Bensel’s role from 2018 to 2019 as assisting “with media relations”, for which neither he nor the archdiocese were provided compensation.‘Dark days’The emails – obtained by the Guardian, WWL Louisiana, the Associated Press and the New York Times – came after Aymond tied his archdiocese to the lucrative sports teams owned by Benson in a way rarely, if ever, seen in the world of sports.A famously devout Catholic, prominent church donor and philanthropist who recentlywonan NFL humanitarian award, Benson inherited the Saints and Pelicans after her husband, Tom Benson, died at age 90 in March 2018. He bought the Saints in 1985 and the Pelicans in 2012. He threatened to move the Saints after Hurricane Katrina devastated New Orleans in 2005 but was convinced to stay.Tom Benson then became a hero and symbol of the city’s recovery from Katrina in 2010, when the Saints won their first – and so far only – Super Bowl title, igniting one of the region’s most ebullient celebrations ever.In Tom Benson’s final years, his children and grandchildren from a previous marriage squared off with Gayle, his third wife, over who would inherit control of his teams and other businesses. Lauscha and Bensel were widely seen to have aligned themselves with Gayle in a struggle that she won. And the succession plan that Tom Benson settled on in her benefit was laid out in a will.It left Gayle Benson in control of the sports teams and made Lauscha executor of Tom’s estate. And in the event Lauscha ever became unwilling or unable to fulfill his duties, they essentially would be split among two others of those most trusted by the Bensons: longtime Saints general manager Mickey Loomis – and Bensel.One of two witnesses to sign thatwillwas Aymond.View image in fullscreenGayle Benson walks to receive the casket of her husband, Tom Benson, with Archbishop Gregory Aymond in New Orleans in 2018.Photograph: Gerald Herbert/APAnd four months after the will took effect upon Benson’s death, a newspaper article about a local deacon and alleged serial child molester thrust Aymond into the center of the global Catholic church’s clergy-abuse scandal.Published by the Advocate, the article questioned how the deacon, George Brignac, had been allowed to keep reading scripture at masses despite his removal from public ministry 20 years earlier. Church officials had removed Brignac from ministry in 1988 after he’d been arrested multiple times on child molestation charges. The article also reported that the archdiocese had paid $550,000 to settle civil legal claims with a survivor of Brignac’s abuse who would later pursue a criminal case against him, though the clergyman would die before he could face trial.Subsequent reporting byWWL Louisiana and an Advocate journalistnow at the Guardian found that the church had quietly paid at least 15 other victims of Brignac a total of roughly $3m to settle their civil damages over their abuse at the deacon’s hands. Those payments were among nearly $12m in abuse-related settlements that the archdiocese doled out during a 10-year period beginning in 2010.Aymond immediately faced public backlash, with critics saying he had failed to live up to the promises of zero tolerance for clerical child molesters made by bishops across the US after a clergy-abuse and cover-up scandal had enveloped Boston’s Catholic archdiocese in 2002. He sought to limit the fallout by claiming that he was unaware that subordinates of his had brought Brignac back into a role that he insisted was largely inconsequential.But later investigations by the Associated Press, WWL Louisiana and the Advocate showed Brignac had also been cleared to meet with – andpresent lessonsto – children at a church school.The Brignac revelations, however, were not the last of Aymond and the church’s problems. A grand jury report issued in Pennsylvania in August 2018 established that Catholic clergy abuse in that state had been more widespread than the public ever previously realized. Cardinal Theodore McCarrick – a former archbishop of Washington DC – resigned amid allegations of child molestation as well as other sexual abuse, though he would later be deemed incompetent to stand trial due to dementia.And, in September 2018, the Advocate published a bombshell article by a journalist now at the Guardian about clergy abuse which implicated New Orleans’ Jesuit high school, the revered Catholic college preparatory from which both Lauscha and Bensel graduated.The articleoutlined how the high school quietly paid settlements to people who claimed that priests or other school employees sexually abused them as children. The school faced some of the same criticisms lobbed at Aymond after Brignac’s exposure. Jesuit high school’s leader at the time defended the institution by condemning the cases in question as a “disgusting” chapter in the school’s history – but one that was left far in its past.Bensel later wrote in an email to the school’s president that he was on Benson’s boat with Aymond when the story about Brignac came out – and the archbishop “was very troubled”.“These are dark days,” Bensel continued.The day after the Brignac story broke, Bensel wrote to Benson: “The issues that the Archbishop has to deal with that never involve him,” on top of a link to – and an attached copy of – the Advocate article about the molester deacon authored by a reporter now at the Associated Press.View image in fullscreenThe Saint Louis cathedral, the seat of the Roman Catholic archdiocese of New Orleans, andthe city’s archbishop, Gregory Aymond.Composite: Angelica Alzona/Guardian Design; Photos via Getty Images/APBenson wrote back suggesting that she had seen the article already. She said she had even spoken to Aymond about it “last week”, several days before its publication. “Archbishop is very upset,” Benson told Bensel. “A mess.”Bensel told Benson he was available to Aymond if the archbishop “ever wants to chat crisis communications”.“We have been through enough at [the] Saints to be a help or sounding board,” Bensel said, about six years after he guided the team through the infamous so-calledBountygatescandal that – among other consequences – resulted in the club’s coach at the time being suspended for an entire season. “But I don’t want to overstep!”Benson replied: “Thank you Greg, I will pass this on to him. I am certain he will appreciate it. Many thanks.”An August 2018 email that Benson sent to the Saints’ governmental liaison made clear how bad she felt for Aymond after the Brignac revelations. “Very sad he is going through this,” Benson wrote while sharing a separate letter by Aymond apologizing “for any wrongdoing by the church or its leadership”. The archbishop had issued the attached missive to a local chapter of a Catholic group called the Equestrian Order of the Holy Sepulchre of Jerusalem, which traces its origins to the First Crusade in the 11th century.Though Jesuit high school’s president back then, Christopher Fronk, later told a Sports Illustrated reporter now at the New York Times, “I never heard from the Saints on this issue” of church abuse, the emails show that he, too, was contacted by Bensel – just two days after his campus community was rocked by the September 2018 Advocate clergy molestation article.“Speaking from personal experience after 23 years with the Saints, when the media and the public attack you at your core, it takes the resolve and focus of people like yourself to lead us to clarity,” Bensel wrote. “The church needs leaders like you and I just wanted to reach out and say you have the support of myself, Dennis and Mrs Benson.“If I can offer any counsel on any issue, I am here for you.”Fronk, who left Jesuit high school in early 2020, replied: “Thanks for your email. I appreciate it. The last couple of days have been long, and I have more ahead of me. I am relying on prayers and support from others. And I may be taking you up on your wise counsel.”‘Work with him’Most of the Saints’ communications about clergy abuse focused on Aymond’s handling of the issue. And the strategy that the archbishop ultimately settled on was one implemented in other US dioceses. He would release a list of priests and deacons who served in New Orleans over the years and had been the subject of credible child molestation accusations.Aymond later told WWL Louisiana that he had contemplated such a maneuver a year before deciding to do so. And he claimed he would have reached that decision without the various local and national scandals consuming the Catholic church at the time, though he acknowledged they created pressure for him to act.Whatever the case, Bensel recommended “transparency” – a wholehearted effort to come clean about the past abuses and apologize for them. And with the list’s release being announced weeks ahead of time, the church would come to count on Bensel to get local media outlets to focus more on hailing Aymond for taking such a courageous step rather than analyzing the roster’s thoroughness.The campaign to set the media’s agenda began in earnest on 17 October 2018, when Bensel wrote to higher-ups at the Advocate as well as the Times-Picayune. He revealed to them that he had been “confidentially discussing the recent horrible issues that [Aymond] and the church are facing”. He also referred to chatting offline with the Advocate and Times-Picayune brass earlier that morning.I am asking that YOU as the most influential newspaper in our state, please get behind [Archbishop Aymond] and work with himGreg Bensel to higher-ups at the Advocate and the Times-Picayune newspapersIn his email to the newspapers, Bensel disclosed Aymond’s plan to out clergymen who “sadly betrayed their role and authority to minister to our children, the elderly and the sick”. And, though he anticipated the gesture would not “simply end all of the past and current suffering and questions”, he wrote that he had an urgent request for the outlets.“I am asking that YOU as the most influential newspaper in our state, please get behind him and work with him,” Bensel said, in part. “We need to tell the story of how this Archbishop is leading us out of this mess. Casting a critical eye on him is neither beneficial nor right.”He said the news media had helped the Saints maintain their footing in the NFL despite being in one of the league’s smallest markets. And he promised that Aymond would have an open-door policy, saying he is “accountable, available and wants to [e]ffect positive change”.“We need your support moving forward as we go through this soon-to-be messy time as we work toward much, much brighter days ahead,” Bensel said. “Help us tell this story.”The archbishop would later abandon that open-door policy. For years, Aymond has consistently declined interview requests from reporters at WWL Louisiana and the Guardian who have questioned his handling of the clergy-abuse crisis. Heusedthe word “Satan” when referring to one of those journalists, the former Advocate staff member, in a text message to a third party that was obtained by the writer.Bensel provided copies of the letters to the newspapers to Benson and Zainey, a sitting, locally based federal judge. The judge – a Jesuit high school alum who has served on the governing board of the New Orleans archdiocese-run college that educates prospective priests – replied: “Thanks very much Greg. You have hit all the points. By his example and leadership, Archbishop Aymond, our shepherd, will continue to lead our church in the right direction – helping us to learn and to rebuild from the mistakes of the past.”Benson, too, praised Bensel’s tone: “Great letter Greg … spot on! Thank you very much.”While it’s not clear when the paper first planned it, that same day the Times-Picayune published a column about the upcoming clergy-abuser list headlined: “Archbishop Aymond is doing the right thing.”A day later, Bensel wrote to the columnist, saying: “very good column on Archbishop Aymond”.Bensel then sent the column – along with the comments left under it by online users – to recipients including Aymond, Vitter (then still the archdiocese’s attorney) and Zainey. He said the comments – including one questioning “how come the church gets to decide who is ‘credibly accused’ and who is not”–were a valuable insight into the public’s psyche. And Bensel urged them not to “delve or hang on to the negative ones, [but] learn from them”.Praying for the Saints victory. Very grateful for your helpArchbishop Aymond to Greg BenselThe emails show how Bensel dedicated some of the following days to preparing Aymond for a meeting with editors of the Advocate, even while he was in Baltimore for a Saints game.“Praying for the Saints victory. Very grateful for your help,” Aymond wrote to Bensel at the time.Referring to the Advocate, Bensel urged Aymond to remember “they need you and you need them”. He said the goal of the gathering with the newspaper’s leadership should be to foster “a better relationship” and drive home how the church is providing “the best measures for a safe environment for our children”.Bensel suggested that the archbishop “not mention … that the general perception is that the ADVOCATE IS UNFAIR to the Archdiocese of New Orleans”. He also promised to “make time” to converse with Aymond about his advice despite being in and out of meetings.“POSITIVE POSITIVE POSITIVE,” Bensel wrote to Aymond. “INCLUSIVE ACCESSIBILITY ACCOUNTABILITY MOVING FORWARD.”Benson, Zainey and Vitter – who is married to a former Republican US senator and had already been nominated to a federal judgeship by Donald Trump in 2018 and wasconfirmedto the post the following year – were among those sent copies of correspondence about that meeting. “Excellent!” Benson remarked. “Many thanks!”Zainey, who later publiclysaidhe could not be sure whether he had ever been sent copies of any of the Saints emails, replied: “Thanks for the wonderful advice. The Arch[bishop]’s sincerity will open their minds and hearts.”(Zainey later recused himself from any rulings directly involving the archdiocese. But then he went on to rule in a case involving a Catholic religious order that a 2021 Louisiana law enabling clergy-abuse survivors to seek damages over decades-old child molestation was unconstitutional. The state supreme court subsequentlyupheldthe law’s constitutionality, effectively negating Zainey’s ruling.)After Aymond’s conversation with the newspaper, and after checking in with “a few folks” at the outlet, Bensel emailed Vitter, Aymond and the archdiocese’s in-house spokesperson, Sarah McDonald, saying that “the Advocate editorial meeting was fruitful, positive and I believe will have a lasting impact”. He said: “Great job by you all.”Yet Aymond would soon become incensed with the Advocate, which late that Octoberpublisheda roster of 16 clergymen who seemed to fit the criteria of the archbishop’s upcoming list based on publicly available news stories and court documents.Aymond wrote that the piece caught him off-guard, and he was particularly upset with how the newspaper’s website had asked clergy-abuse victims to contact the outlet to tell their stories rather than direct them to the archdiocese “to allow a proper investigation”.“I want to work with you, but we must both be transparent,” Aymond said. “Will people believe we are working together?”Upon being provided a copy of Aymond’s missive to the newspaper, Bensel quickly replied: “This is a GREAT response.”Emails show that the newspaper replied by saying it contacted McDonald prior to the publication of the report. The Advocate said it didn’t believe its editors’ earlier conversation with Aymond prevented it “from continuing … reporting”.Nonetheless, the Advocate informed Aymond that it had taken offline the request for victims to contact the newspaper, saying it was a “last minute addition” by a digital editor.Bensel later wrote to Aymond: “An excellent response from them.”‘Allowed us to take certain people off the list’The emails show that – 10 days before the documents were released – Aymond provided Bensel an early draft of a letter that the archbishop issued to churchgoers alongside his clergy-abuser list. Bensel replied with suggested changes in handwriting.A notable one: the draft had made it a point to say most of the accusations involved in the list “go back 30, 40, 50 or more years”. Bensel suggested stronger language, asserting that those accusations went back “decades – 30, 40, 50 and even 70 years ago”.The final letter evidently adopted that suggestion,reading: “Most of the accusations are from incidents that occurred decades ago, even as long as 70 years ago.”At last, Aymond’s clergy-abuser list came out the day after Catholics observed the Feast of All Saints and New Orleans’ NFL team celebrated the 52nd anniversary of its founding.Had a cc w Leon Cannizzaro last night that allowed us to take certain people off the [clergy-abuser] listGreg Bensel to Dennis Lauscha, using common abbreviations for “conference call” and “with”, and referring to New Orleans’ district attorney at the timeThelist– initially containing 57 names – was provided to media outlets that morning under an embargo, which prevents organizations from publishing information that was supplied to them prior to a specific time. And about three hours before that embargo expired, Lauscha emailed Bensel and asked: “Do you see any shockers on the list? Did your SJ you discussed yesterday make the list? The former Loyola president is the biggest shock to me.”Bensel’s quick reply did not address to whom “SJ” refers, though the letters are the initials of the Jesuit religious order’s formal name, the Society of Jesus. It also doesn’t comment on Bernard Knoth, a former president of the Jesuits’ Loyola University New Orleans, who was included on the clergy-abuser list.The Saints attorney’s statement on Saturday said Lauscha was referring to a clergyman “rumored to have been accused of abuse [and] was expected to be on the list”.View image in fullscreenDennis Lauscha.Photograph: WWLTV“It is Mr Lauscha’s understanding that the clergyman to whom he referred in his query to Mr Bensel was included on the list on a supplemental list,” the statement said.Regardless, back in early November 2018, Bensel’s reply read: “Had a cc w Leon Cannizzaro last night that allowed us to take certain people off the list.“This list will get updated, and that is our message that we will not stop here today.”The Guardian asked Cannizzaro about a 29 October 2018 typed message informing him of a call from Vitter. Vitter was “following up on conversation you had with Archbishop Aymond”, said the message left for Cannizzaro just four days before the list’s release.“If I was in a conversation with him, I would’ve been looking for any records he would have had relative to complaints made against priests so we could reach out to those victims to see if there was a prosecutable case,” Cannizzaro said.Meanwhile, Cannizzaro has denied a conversation with Bensel or any of his colleagues ever took place, including recently when he said in an interview: “I was not on any conference call with anybody from the Saints about this.“I do not ever remember having a conversation with the Saints about any case going on with our office” at that specific time.The Saints lawyer’s statement on Saturday also said that no one from the team spoke with Cannizzaro. Instead, Bensel’s email to Lauscha referred “to a conversation that he was told had occurred between a member of the staff of the archdiocese and … Cannizzaro, concerning the list”.“Mr Bensel has no firsthand knowledge of what was said by anyone during the conversation or in any communication between the archdiocese and the district attorney’s office,” said the Saints lawyer’s statement. “The … email refers to Mr Bensel’s understanding that the list would be updated by the archdiocese.“It was also Mr Bensel’s understanding that one purpose the archdiocese had in consulting with [Cannizzaro’s] office was to determine whether disclosure of any member of the clergy under consideration for inclusion on the list would interfere with a criminal investigation. Neither Mr Bensel nor any member of the Saints organization was involved in the determinations made by the archdiocese.”‘A strong and faithful message’On the day of the list’s release, McDonald had also asked Bensel to join Aymond as the archbishop gave interviews to local media outlets that they could not publish prior to the expiration of the embargo imposed on the document. “The archbishop would appreciate you being there for the Advocate especially,” McDonald wrote to Bensel.“I have blocked out the entire morning,” Bensel replied. “I will see you there.”In advance of those embargoed interviews, Lauscha sent Bensel 13 tough questions that Aymond should be prepared to answer. Lauscha suggested deflecting if asked about the number of listed credibly accused clergymen by answering, “One abuse is too many.”“Excellent,” Bensel replied to Lauscha, before forwarding the questions to McDonald as well as Vitter.The Saints’ statement on Saturday said: “The questions that Mr Lauscha suggested were intended to encourage openness and transparency.”Bensel attended the Advocate’s and WWL Louisiana’s separate embargoed interviews with Aymond. In the conversation with the Advocate, Aymond did remark: “One incident is too many.”Bensel remained silent during the interviews with both outlets. However, at some point later that morning, he emailed a Saints employee who had previously worked for the publisher of the Advocate.“I want [the Advocate publisher] to write a positive opinion about how this archbishop has handled the transparency of releasing these names and his diligence in making this right,” Bensel wrote to the Saints employee. “Will call to discuss.”There is no indication in the emails that the conversation Bensel sought took place. But the Advocate did publish an opinion column concluding with the words: “Transparency about grave wrongdoing, however painful, is the best way to help victims, serve parishioners, and support the work of the many church clerics who have brought joy, rather than suffering, to the people they promised to serve.”I hope the Picayune would show [Archbishop Aymond] … some support in an editorialGreg Bensel to the Times-Picayune opinion editorBensel also wrote to the Times-Picayune’s opinion editor, saying: “Today the Archbishop met face to face with all of the media – he sent a strong and faithful message!“I hope the Picayune would show him – the man – some support in an editorial – our community listens and values [what] you all have to say!!”The Times-Picayune’s next couple of print editions did not contain such an editorial. But as part of its news coverage about the list, the newspaper did publisha letterin its entirety by Christopher Fronk, Jesuit high school’s then president, that expressed support for Aymond’s release of the document, which contained the names of several abusive priests who had worked at Jesuit high school. Fronk’s letter hailed the disclosure as having been carried out in “a spirit of reconciliation and transparency”.Once the list’s embargo expired, Aymond granted his only live, on-air interview that day to radio talkshow host Newell Normand, a former sheriff of a suburban New Orleans area – at Bensel’s urging.Normand’s employer, WWL Radio, has long held the exclusive rights to the Saints’ local broadcasts. And Bensel brokered the conversation between Normand and Aymond through emails involving the director of the radio station, which – despite its call letters – is not affiliated with WWL Louisiana, the TV channel.McDonald, the archdiocese spokesperson, sent Bensel eight questions to “share with Newell to cover” two days before the interview. Bensel replied to McDonald, copied Normand as well as the host’s station director, and told the radio outlet’s employees: “These questions are a great framework for Newell.”“Love my Di,” Bensel wrote to the station director, referring to her by a nickname, after the organizations all agreed to the interview. She responded: “Love you too, GB.”Normand later asked Aymond at least four of the eight proposed questions in a fashion that was substantially similar – though not necessarily verbatim – to what the church suggested. The rest, Aymond answered unprompted.The suggested questions covered how law enforcement had been provided with a copy of the list; what emotions Aymond was experiencing that day; how the roster “is accurate” but may expand; and that adequate measures were in place for the archdiocese to protect children. Aymond said on the program that the number of priests on the list was relatively small given how many clergymen there had been in the archdiocese over the years, but that even that low tally was too much.As an example of the talking points, Aymond’s spokesperson suggested that Normand ask her boss, “What has this process been like for you?” After Bensel passed the questions along, Normand asked the archbishop, “I know your heart is broken over this – in going through this. How has this process been for you?”The suggestions from the church included: “There were earlier media reports that said the list may not be complete, but this is an extensive list going back very far. It seems comprehensive. (ask for response).”Normand didn’t ask Aymond that on the air. But according to a transcript, after the interview ended, the host remarked, “I know some folks say that they already believe that there are some names that have not been revealed yet, and [Aymond] has said that that is actually a possibility.”Normand, who has repeatedly criticized the church’s handling of the abuse crisis on air, did raise several issues with the archbishop that weren’t outlined by the archdiocese through Bensel. For example, he asked Aymond why the church didn’t inform law enforcement about allegations of abuse earlier. He also raised concerns about priests harassing other clergy. And he spoke about his own journey as a Catholic to accept that child molestation by priests was rampant.A statement on Saturday from the corporation that owns WWL Radio, Audacy, said: “WWL stands by its coverage of this story. We have no additional comment.”‘I don’t get paid enough’The volume of communications between the Saints and the church lessened after the release of the list, according to the emails. But the two sides still stayed in close contact for many more months.Between February and March of 2019, mere weeks after the Saints nearly clinched what would have been a second Super Bowl berth, the organizations communicated about a request from Aymond for Benson to submit to the Advocate a flattering letter to the editor. The letter’s purpose was to exalt the archdiocese and charitable programs it has led or participated in.Make as many edits as you see fitGreg Bensel to New Orleans church officials regarding a letter to the Advocate newspaperFor help on crafting the letter, the emails show that Bensel brought in some of the Saints’ media relations staffers who ordinarily facilitate sports journalists’ interviews with the team’s players and coaches. (One successfully suggested naming three Saints players who have been first-team All-Pro selections while touting their and Benson’s work with certain social or charitable programs, including an archdiocese-affiliatedfood bankto which she donated $3.5m in 2019.)Bensel gave the archdiocese the opportunity to review a draft of what he called “a very robust letter of support from Mrs Benson”, saying: “Make as many edits as you see fit.”He eventually distributed what he said Benson’s teams “came up with in conjunction with the archdiocese” among the Saints’ general counsel, their governmental liaison and Lauscha, according to the emails.“Do any of you see an issue with this???” Bensel wrote.General counsel Vicky Neumeyer replied: “I have to chime in that I don’t really like it. I don’t want [Benson] to appear to be a puppet for the archdiocese because we have way too many constituents from all walks of life.”Bensel wrote back to Neumeyer that he would come chat with her. She later sent an email saying she spoke with Lauscha and that all she meant to communicate was the letter “should be more personal and less stone-cold facts”.View image in fullscreenThe New Orleans Saints and Pelicans training and practice facility at the Ochsner sports performance center in Metairie, Louisiana.Photograph: Kirby Lee/Getty ImagesAfter Bensel submitted it in her name, Benson’s letter to the editor appeared inthe Advocate. Part of the letter addressed the local church’s work combating sex trafficking and advocating for children’s online safety, about five years before state police began investigating allegations that the archdiocese had allegedly sexually trafficked minors.“Many issues in our society are very difficult to talk about, such as pornography, online safety for children, drug abuse and sex trafficking,” the letter said. It also asserted that “the local Catholic Church is addressing these issues head-on”.The Saints’ statement on Saturday said that the letter was not “misleading” and did not excuse “the misconduct of members of the clergy”.Soon thereafter, for an Advocate story on the first anniversary of Tom Benson’s death, Bensel, McDonald and Aymond exchanged emails about the archbishop providing a statement praising Gayle’s support of the church in the first year of her Saints and Pelicans ownership. Gayle Benson and Bensel were given the chance to review and approve the statement, which read: “Mrs Benson is a woman of deep faith, and she puts her faith into action.”This is what we plan to send once we know you guys are good with thisGreg Bensel comment to New Orleans archdiocese about a statement from team owner Gayle BensonBensel, Benson, Lauscha, McDonald and Aymond all then communicated about an article that the Times-Picayune – which would be acquired by the Advocate weeks later – was preparing for Easter chronicling the early aftermath of the clergy-abuse list’s release. Benson had been asked for comment about how she perceived Aymond to have navigated that period. She gave Bensel permission to draft her statement – but to call Aymond “for his approval” prior to releasing it.Bensel then prepared a quote, sent it to McDonald, copied Aymond and said: “This is what we plan to send once we know you guys are good with this.”The published quote from Benson that Aymond signed off on read: “My personal relationship with the archbishop aside, I believe he has shown tremendous leadership and guidance through this very tough time. In my opinion, he has dealt with this very sad issue head on, with great resolve and determination to do the right thing and to do it as fully transparent as he is allowed.”Bensel then emailed Benson, Lauscha and Aymond a link to that Times-Picayunearticleonce it was published. “Thank you, Greg,” Benson wrote back to Bensel.As late as June 2019, Bensel was still helping the archdiocese with its crisis communications, preparing Aymond for an interview with the Advocate about the effect of the clergy-abuse scandal in general onchurch finances. “I don’t get paid enough – Helping the Archbishop prep for his 9 am meeting,” he wrote in an email to his ex-wife, after Aymond copied him on to a chain of communications about the upcoming interview.A subpoena would put an end to the Saints and the church’s email correspondence about a month later.‘We are proud’The Saints and archdiocese’s decision to coordinate their messaging created a headache for the organizations after it became clear that Aymond’s list had raised more questions than it answered. Numerous clergy molestation survivors came forward complaining that their abusers were omitted from the list, even in cases in which the church said it believed their allegations and had paid them substantial financial settlements.The list did not provide the number of accusations against each clergyman or say exactly when they worked at the local churches to which they were assigned. That concerned the clergy-abuse survivor community, who worried the paucity of information might be an impediment for unreported victims contemplating coming forward.It also concerned Cannizzaro’s top assistant district attorney, Graymond Martin, who responded to receiving the list by drafting a request on 8 November 2018 for more information, including basics such as any details indicating “where the alleged acts occurred, … when each act … occurred and some description of each of the alleged acts”.Martin sent that draft to a subordinate. But it is unclear whether the request was formally sent to the archdiocese.In his radio interview with Normand, Aymond emphasized that the archdiocese would be reporting complaints against living clergy to law enforcement. Bensel’s email indicated he consulted with Martin’s boss, Cannizzaro, about the list before its release. But Martin’s email noted that the DA’s office still had not received “copies of any documentation … of these complaints and the results of any inquiry conducted by the Archdiocese”.Cannizzaro filed charges of child rape against one person on the list: George Brignac, in connection with the allegations at the center of the $550,000 settlement paid to one of his victims in July 2018. But Brignac, 85, died in 2020 while awaiting trial on charges that dated back to the late 1970s and early 1980s, sparing the church a courtroom spectacle.The church did not catch the same break nearly five years later, after Cannizzaro’s successor as DA, Jason Williams, intervened in civil lawsuits and subpoenaed secret documents from the archdiocese to pursue child rape charges against a local priest named Lawrence Hecker.Hecker’s name had not been disclosed until the list came out, even though he had been removed from ministry in 2002 because he was a suspected abuser. A survivor then accused Hecker of raping him when he was an underage Catholic high school student in 1975 – a crime that until then had not been disclosed to authorities and had no deadline before which prosecutors had to file charges.The prosecution of Hecker kicked into high gear in the summer of 2023, when the Guardian and WWL Louisiana began publishing a series of reports on awritten confessionfrom the priest to his church superiors in 1999 that he had sexually molested or harassed several children during his career. The outlets also got Hecker to confess to being a serial child molesteron cameraand showed how the church took steps to deliberatelyhidethe extent of his abusive history for decades beforehand.Ultimately, Williams’ office charged Hecker with the former student’s 1975 assault. Hepleaded guiltyin December of last year at age 93 to child rape and other crimes, and hediedin prison less than a week after receiving a mandatory life sentence.Meanwhile, evidence turned up by Hecker’s prosecution prompted the state police investigator who built the case against him to swear under oath that he had probable cause to suspect the archdiocese ran a child sex-trafficking ring responsible for the “widespread … abuse of minors dating back decades”. That abuse was concealed from authorities beyond just Hecker’s case, and an investigation into the matter that could generate criminal charges against the clerical molesters’ protectors was ongoing, the sworn statement said.Though Hecker and Brignac were on the initial version of the list, it eventually grew from 57 names to about 80.A number of the additions came only after news media reported on conspicuous omissions, including two –Robert CooperandBrian Highfill– added after WWL Louisiana and an Advocate reporter now at the Guardian questioned the archdiocese about them. Two otheradditionsinvolved clergymen who alsopleaded guilty– albeit in suburban New Orleans communities – to sexually molesting children, either before or after their ordination.The deluge of claims eventually drove the archdiocese to file for bankruptcy protection in the spring of 2020.That proceeding – which remained ongoing as of the publication of this report – led to more than 500 abuse claims againstmore than 300clergymen, religious brothers and sisters, and lay staffers. The archdiocese does not consider most of those as being credibly accused, saying it only has the authority to include clergymen – priests and deacons – on its sanctioned list. And it could cost the archdiocese hundreds of millions of dollars in payments to clergy-abuse victims to settle the bankruptcy, if the church even manages to do so successfully.Saturday’s statement from the Saints’ lawyer said Benson would not donate money to the archdiocese for it to settle with clergy molestation survivors.“That abuse occurred is a terrible fact,” the statement continued. “As a member of the Catholic faith, Mrs Benson will continue to support the church and the great things it does. Her support is unwavering, but she has no intention of donating funds to the archdiocese to pay for settlements with abuse victims, and she has not done so.”As all the disparate cases leading to the church bankruptcy made spectacular headlines, the Saints emails remained hidden for years. And the reasons for that are complex.The communications had been produced as evidence in an unresolved civil lawsuit involving allegations against Brignac – the deacon who had been charged with sex crimes multiple times since the 1970s but had been reading at masses as recently as the summer of 2018.In July 2019, the attorneys for that pending lawsuit’s plaintiff – who have also represented victims of Hecker – raised eyebrows byissuing a subpoenafor copies of all communications among Saints and archdiocesan officials. The attorneys wrote in an accompanying court filing that the subpoena was necessary because the case’s discovery process turned up emails as well as other evidence establishing that Bensel was advising the archdiocese on how to navigate its clergy-abuse crisis.News media outlets almost immediately began trying to access and report on the emails. Bensel was not pleased with their interest. Beside asking Lauscha over email to call his cellphone, he told an Advocate reporter seeking comment on the subpoena to instead ask his newspaper’s owner, John Georges. Bensel then said his organization had nothing to say on the subpoena, echoing an email to him from Lauscha which read: “As with any legal matter, we have no comment.”The last of the “Saints emails” shows that Bensel forwarded the reporter’s request for comment to Georges. There is no indication in the emails that Georges responded.In short order, WWL Louisiana, the now-combined Times-Picayune/Advocate newspaper and two other local television stations joined the Associated Press in suing for access to the emails. The media argued that the missives were a matter of public interest. Attorneys for the Saintsarguedthat its correspondence with the church should remain private – while also maintaining that they had merely provided public relations advice to the archdiocese and had done nothing to be ashamed of.View image in fullscreenArchbishop Gregory Aymond and Gayle Benson during Fat Tuesday celebrations in 2020 in New Orleans.Photograph: Jonathan Bachman/Getty ImagesThey explicitly denied having had “a hand in determining which names should or should not have been included on the pedophile list”, as the attorneys who obtained the subpoena put it.“We are proud of the role we played and yes, in hindsight, we would help again to assist the archdiocese in its ability to publish the list with the hope of taking this step to heal the community,” Benson wrote ina statement. “I want to be clear … that I am not going to be deterred in helping people in need, whether a friend seeking advice or a stranger in need, it does not matter, our list is long.”In what seemed to be directed at news organizations whose businesses depend to some extent on credentialed access to – or advertising and broadcasting rights from – the Saints and Pelicans, the statement also said: “I hope that is not lost on the same people that write such articles when they too come asking for help or support.”On Saturday, the Saints’ statement said Benson was “proud of her executive team and supports them”.“While the public relations assistance offered to the archdiocese has come under scrutiny, Mrs Benson and her team remain steadfast in bringing our community together and continuing to help the good people of our community,” the Saints’ statement said.Nonetheless, the New Orleans archdiocese opted to move on from relying on Bensel after the July 2019 subpoena. It later retained a crisis communications consultant from a local firm at a cost of $10,000 monthly, public court filings have shown.The media’s efforts to secure the Saints emails hit a significant snag when the Covid-19 pandemic shut down the local court system beginning in March 2020.Then, on 1 May 2020, the archdiocese filed forbankruptcy. The move automatically and indefinitely halted litigation pending against the archdiocese.The state court judge overseeing the case that produced the Saints emails never determined whether or not the emails were confidential.As part of the bankruptcy proceedings, there were confidentiality orders applied to various archdiocesan documents. One of the primary justifications for such orders was to protect the identities of clergy-abuse victims.In the correspondence between the Saints and the church that the Guardian and WWL Louisiana reviewed, no clergy-abuse victims are identified.Nonetheless, the Saints lawyer’s statement on Saturday alleged that the emails were “leaked to the press in violation of a court order”. The statement also complained that the team was confronted with those communications as New Orleans prepared to host the Super Bowl showdown between the Kansas City Chiefs and the Philadelphia Eagles on 9 February.“The team and the entire city are committed to hosting the greatest Super Bowl week and game ever,” the team’s statement said.Ultimately, journalists managed to obtain and expose the emails.One of those journalists was the first to expose Brignac before joining the Associated Press. Another investigated the Saints’ connection to Aymond in Sports Illustrated before joining the New York Times. And two contributed significantly to efforts to bring Hecker to justice at WWL Louisiana and the Guardian.In the US, call or text the Childhelp abuse hotline on 800-422-4453 or visit their website for more resources and to report child abuse or DM for help.

It said it believed the spyware was made by Paragon Solutions, an Israel-based company that was recently taken over by a US private equity company.Paragon declined to comment. A person close to the company said it had about 35 government clients, which the person described as democratic governments.What is Pegasus spyware and how does it hack phones?Read moreIn El Gomati’s case, the discovery was made shortly after he said in Facebook posts that he had gained access to documents fromLibyaabout illegal migration networks, their connection to detention centres, and alleged links between militia leaders in Tripoli and Zawia and Italian intelligence officers.Italy’s support of the Libyan coastguard and militias in Libya to help stop people from crossing the Mediterraneanhas long been a subject of criticismby activists, who say it has sown chaos in the country.El Gomati says he is worried for the safety of his confidential sources in Libya. When a phone is successfully penetrated by Paragon’s spyware, which is called Graphite, the user of the spyware has total control of a person’s phone, including being able to read encrypted messages on apps such as Signal and WhatsApp.“As an activist against corruption in Libya, protecting my sources is of utmost importance. There are individuals risking their lives to expose the deep-rooted corruption in my country and the corruption of the ruling class,” he said. “These matters can mean the difference between life and death.”He added: “The thought of someone eavesdropping on you all day, reading your messages and having access to pictures of your children is terrifying.”Like other makers of military-grade spyware, Paragon – which was founded by the former Israeli prime minister Ehud Barak – sells its spyware to government clients for the expressed purpose of targeting possible criminals. The company had reportedly agreed a $2m (£1.6m) contract with US immigration services last year under the Biden administration, but the dealwas put on hold and placed under reviewafter questions were raised about whether it complied with a Biden-era executive order limiting the use of spyware by the US government.El Gomati contacted the Guardian about the alert he had received by WhatsApp just hours after the Guardian published a separate story aboutan Italian investigative journalist, Francesco Cancellato, who also received an alert from WhatsApp about his phone having possibly been compromised by the same spyware.Cancellato is the editor-in-chief of Fanpage, an investigative outlet that gained attention last year after it published a report aboutyoung fascistswithin the far-right party of Giorgia Meloni, Italy’s prime minister.It is not clear what government client was behind the targeting of El Gomati and Cancellato. WhatsApp said the targets it sent alerts to live in more than two dozen countries, including in Europe.Meloni’s office Meloni did not respond to a request for comment.More recently, El Gomati said he had been playing an active role in reporting onthe case of Osama Najim, also known as Almasri. Najim, who is the chief of Libya’s judicial police, is wanted by the international criminal court (ICC) for alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity, as well as alleged rape and murder.He also presides over Mitiga prison, a facility near Tripoli condemned by human rights organisations for the arbitrary detention, torture and abuse of political dissidents, migrants and refugees.He was freed last month owing to a procedural technicality and flown on an official state aircraft to Tripoli. The ICC demanded an explanation, saying on Wednesday that he had been released from custody and transported back to Libya by Meloni’s government “without prior notice or consultation with the court”.Explore more on these topicsWhatsAppLibyaIsraelGiorgia MeloniMiddle East and north AfricaItalySurveillancenewsShareReuse this content"

The warning said it was possible that sensitive information could have been taken, although none was published, the Times said.According to the paper, the previous address had been “dangerously obvious” and lacked the backup security of two-factor authentication, under which an attempted login from an unknown device requires a separate identity check. These were both addressed for Starmer’s replacement account.Around the same time as the suspected Starmer security breach, a collection of emails from Sir Richard Dearlove, a former director of MI6, and other figureswas published afteran apparent hack also by a Russian group.At the time, Google said the release of the emails appeared to be the work of a Russian group it called Coldriver. The hackers published emails from Dearlove and others claiming they detailed the work of a group of pro-Brexit plotters.Instead, the bulk of the emails, dating from 2018 to 2019, showed a selection of Brexit supporters frustrated with then-prime minister Theresa May’s willingness to seek compromises with the EU.Explore more on these topicsHackingKeir StarmerRussiaUkraineCybercrimenewsShareReuse this content"

The company said the tool will take between five and 30 minutes to complete each task and will cite the source for each claim it makes.OpenAI said deep research was for professionals who work in areas such as finance, science and engineering, but it can also examine purchases such as cars and furniture.It is based on o3, OpenAI’s latest “reasoning” model, which takes longer to process queries than conventional models and has yet to be released in full publicly. It comes after OpenAI announced the release on Friday of another derivation of o3 – a freeslimmed-down versioncalled o3-mini.The power of the full o3 model wasflagged in the International AI Safety Report published last week. The study’s lead author, Yoshua Bengio, said its capabilities “could have profound implications for AI risks”. He said o3 had surprised experts, including himself, with its performance in a key abstract reasoning test.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Some are sceptical given the lack of blockbuster results at the LHC since the landmark discovery of the Higgs boson in 2012 and Germany hasdescribed the $17bn proposal as unaffordable. But Thomson said AI has provided fresh impetus to the hunt for new physics at the subatomic scale – and that major discoveries could occur after 2030 when a major upgrade will boost theLHC’s beam intensity by a factor of ten.This will allow unprecedented observations of the Higgs boson, nicknamed the God particle, that grants mass to other particles and binds the universe together.“There’s a particular measurement about the Higgs boson that is so fundamental to the nature of the universe,” said Thomson. “What we will be looking at is producing not one Higgs boson but two Higgs bosons at the same time.”This, he said, will allow scientists to measure how the Higgs particle gives mass to itself for the first time – a phenomenon called Higgs self-coupling.Two Higgs bosons appear at once so rarely and the particles are so elusive – disintegrating into more familiar particles as soon as they come into existence – that five years ago Thomson said he would have assumed this was beyond the LHC’s capabilities. “Now I’m confident we are going to make a good measurement,” said Thomson.The strength of Higgs self-coupling is crucial for understanding how, a trillionth of a second after the big bang, a change in the Higgs field resulted in particles suddenly acquiring mass. It could also reveal whether the Higgs field has reached a final, stable resting state or whether another drastic transition could occur in future, a scenario that would see the universe as we know it evaporate almost instantaneously. The Standard Model of physics suggests that this is a possibility – but there is no need for alarm.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

On the other hand, it’s a scientific question – could this happen?”According to Thomson: “It’s a very deep fundamental property of the universe, one we don’t fully understand. If we saw the Higgs self-coupling being different from our current theory, that that would be another massive, massive discovery. And you don’t know until you’ve made the measurement.”AI is being injected into every aspect of the LHC operation, from deciding which data to collect to how it should be interpreted. “When the LHC is colliding protons, it’s making around 40m collisions a second and we have to make a decision within a microsecond … which events are something interesting that we want to keep and which to throw away,” said Dr Katharine Leney, who works on the LHC’s Atlas experiment. “We’re already now doing better with the data that we’ve collected than we thought we’d be able to do with 20 times more data ten years ago. So we’ve advanced by 20 years at least. A huge part of this has been down to AI.”Scientists have long hoped the LHC might be capable of producing dark matter, a substance that is believed to make up a large fraction of the universe. But given that the nature of dark matter is entirely unknown, searching for it is a challenging task. Generative AI could help prise this puzzle apart, according to Thomson. “You can start to ask more complex, open-ended questions,” he said. “Rather than searching for a particular signature, you ask the question: ‘Is there something unexpected in this data?’”Explore more on these topicsLarge Hadron ColliderParticle physicsPhysicsArtificial intelligence (AI)newsShareReuse this content"

Prepare to say goodbye to a lot of free timeKeith StuartMon 3 Feb 2025 09.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 3 Feb 2025 12.19 ESTShareMany years ago, when Civilization II was on its way, I’d just started as a writer on the video game magazine Edge. As a fan of the original Civilization, a complex turn-based strategy sim about building vast kingdoms through thousands of years of human history, I was keen to review the sequel and my editor let me. Reader, I became completely addicted. I played the game for two weeks non-stop, leaving many pages of the magazine unwritten. This earned me a very severe written warning. In short, Sid Meier’s series almost ended my career in games writing – which is perhaps why I didn’t review the following four instalments. Now it is back, and I can no longer avoid it. I must face my seductive nemesis.In many ways, this is the game that I, and many thousands of other fans, have always known and obsessively loved: a complex, far-reaching and fascinating simulation tracking the rise of empires from ancient tribal groups to modern-day superpowers. As a player, you found towns and cities, gather resources and research new technologies, from literacy to nuclear fission, while sending out settlers, merchants and armies to expand your reach and either placate or destroy other nations. Victory can come from military might, cultural cachet or economic domination, depending on how you play and what you’re interested in. No two campaigns are ever the same.View image in fullscreenExtra nuance … Civilization VII.Photograph: 2K GamesFor this new instalment, coming almost a decade after its predecessor, Firaxis has made some radical alterations. The biggest by far is that you no longer guide a single civilisation throughout the entire campaign. Instead, you select a leader with attributes you admire – the sneaky Machiavelli, perhaps, or how about the wise Confucius – then guide that figure through a series of three distinct historical ages picking a different nation for each section. Each nation has its own unique units and buildings, adding extra nuance to your game. In my first playthrough I started the Antiquity Age with Greece because I really fancied building the Acropolis. Then I flipped to the flighty Normans for the Exploration Age, then finished as the US for the Modern Age. You don’t loseeverythingin this switching process – all your discoveries and progress points from the previous age remain, and you can opt to keep all your towns. You’re also able to select specific legacies of your past to bring forward.This gives the game a very definite structure, combatting the malaise that can often occur hours into a Civ campaign when you realise you don’t stand a chance against some brutally powerful neighbour who’s somehow developed an army five times the size of yours. If you’re struggling during one age, you just need to hold out until the next one arrives, giving you the chance to reset your objectives and relationships with nearby nations. It also ensures a technological makeover for all your units, so you can’t enter the modern era with a civilisation that can build nuclear power stations but still fights with spears and gets about the place on horseback. In a sense, it’s like your leader is on a journey through successive domains – which makes it feel more like an adventure than a straightforward sim.View image in fullscreenMore approachable … Civilization VII.Photograph: 2K GamesThere are other changes to make the game more approachable for modern players. Leaders attain attribute points based on achievements in six categories such as culture, science and combat, which can be spent on related skill trees – just like a role-playing game. There are also legacy targets that act as quests, such as building a certain number of Wonders of the World or making key scientific discoveries, moving you towards an outright victory.Beneath all this, lots of systems have been tweaked and re-thought. Maintaining diplomatic relations with other nations is a multifaceted dance involving the use of a new currency – influence – to organise shared cultural events and economic pacts, or when things go badly, many different types of subterfuge and sabotage. Throughout the years, narrative events crop up like Chance cards in a game of Monopoly, providing moments of humorous challenge. How do you react when a famous poet writes a highly critical epic about you? What do you do when a mysterious stranger demands that you copy and pass on a dusty old scroll to at least three other civilisations or face a terrible curse?Does it still resemble a sort of digitised board game? No. The landscapes may be divided into hexagonal tiles in the traditions of table-top wargaming, but they are now crammed with colour and authentic detail, from craggy mountains to swirling seas, to lively cities crowded with ornate buildings reflecting both the time period and the civilisation they belong to. Battles play out as animated tussles between intricate miniaturised troops and thundering armoured vehicles. Occasional natural disasters send floods, tornadoes and fires across the map with devastating drama.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toPushing ButtonsFree weekly newsletterKeza MacDonald's weekly look at the world of gamingEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

You get the nations that hide in a corner and quietly invent space travel before you’ve got a reliable train service, and then there are the warmongers – and I’m looking at you Gilbert du Motier – who start little fights to probe your defences then turn vicious and unrelenting, surrounding your cities and crushing isolated units. Alternatively, there’s always the cross-platform multiplayer mode if you want to pit yourself against human competitors; I wasn’t able to test this on public servers before release, but it has performed well in previews.So here we are, more than 30 years after the original game, still hungry to rule the world – and devouring every morsel of maniacal power. Some veterans may balk at the structural changes: Civilization VII is very much the Civilization for now – deep and complex, but with an emphasis on human drama and achievement rather than the sweep of faceless units across a mathematical matrix. There are still few moments in video games as pleasing as building the Hanging Gardens, or discovering a bountiful new location for a town, or marching a phalanx of troops into a battered enemy capital. This game, which once almost cost me my job, will gracefully sneak away with hours, days and possibly months of your life. But then, nobody ever conquered the world in an afternoon.Civilization VII is launched on PC (version tested), PS4/5, Switch,Xbox Oneand Xbox Series S/X, 11 FebruaryExplore more on these topicsGamesPCXbox series S/XNintendo SwitchPlayStation 4PlayStation 5Xbox OnereviewsShareReuse this content"

If he succeeds, Nobel laureate Paul Krugmanwarns, it would be a 21st-century coup – with power slipping from elected officials’ hands. The real story hidden behind the president’strade war, he says, is the hijacking of government. And Mr Krugman’s right.By usurping the authority to shut down government programmes at will – even those funded by Congress – Mr Trump could slash federal spending and taxes while pretending to balance the books. In reality, he’d berobbingthe poor to enrich the wealthy. In a world where economic jargon has been corrupted to depict exploitation as “wealth creation”, the audacity of Mr Trump – and his lackeys – topersonallyprofit is breathtaking. Mr Trump’s philosophy is simple: let the uber-rich do whatever they want, with little or no oversight. The result will be vast wealth for a select few while life grows nastier and shorter for the many.His plan took shape last weekend when Mr Trump removed a top-ranking Treasury official who had been blocking his billionaire crony,Elon Musk, from accessing the federal payment system – exposing the sensitive personal data of millions of Americans, as well as details of public contractors who compete directly with Mr Musk’s businesses. The system disburses over $5tn annually, and Mr Musk and his allies, wrote analystNathan Tankus, are “clearly aiming to redesign” it to serve the Trumpian agenda – opening the door for the US president to seek retribution against his political opponents.To see the impact, look no further than one of Mr Trump’s first moves:freezingtrillions in federal spending – particularly on foreign aid, nongovernmental organisations, “DEI initiatives”, “woke gender ideology” and the “Green New Deal”. The courts blocked the measure as unconstitutional – but not before it wreaked havoc on government agencies and nonprofits, especially those aidingvulnerablegroups like homeless veterans. Mr Muskclaimshe will close the US agency for international aid (USAid) – but this remains moot as a federal body islegallyrequired to administer aid.Just like his trade war, Mr Trump’s claim to “impoundment” authority – the supposed right to unilaterally halt spending – exposes thecore contradictionof his power grab: he postures like amonarchbecause he’s too weak to govern as a president. He wields tariffs at will, bypassing Congress with “national security” claims – yet cut a deal with Mexico that both sidesspunas victory.In his first term, Mr Trump’sprotectionistcrusade – tariffs on China, a Nafta shake-up and attacking allies’ trade policies – was sold as a revolution. Instead, it was a self-inflicted wound. His administration slapped $80bn in new “taxes” on Americans through tariffs, only to see supply chains reroute to Vietnam and Indonesia rather than bring jobs back home. The real cost? A 0.2% hit to GDP and 142,000 jobs lost,accordingto the Tax Foundation. Without serious investment in domestic industry, the America First trade strategy didn’t rebuild US manufacturing – it just drove up costs. Mr Trump’s chaos isn’t confidence – it’s desperation. He’s trying to conjure power he doesn’t actually have. He is manufacturing a perception of dominance in the hope that Americans will simply accept it. The real danger is letting his illusion of power become reality.Explore more on these topicsUS politicsOpinionDonald TrumpElon MuskTrump administrationUSAidMexicoeditorialsShareReuse this content"

Now the region is thrust in the global spotlightMon 3 Feb 2025 11.21 ESTLast modified on Mon 3 Feb 2025 17.29 ESTShareThe enormous semi-enclosed bay, its waters flanked by the Florida and Yucatán peninsulas and partially blockaded by Cuba, has been called the Golfo de Méxicofor centuries, a name that first appeared on a world map in 1550. And for centuries the name bothered no one.Thomas Jefferson used the name without shame, even as he, Donald Trump-like, imagined dominating nearby nations. If the US could take Cuba, Jefferson wrote in 1823, it would control the “Gulf of Mexico and the countries and isthmus bordering on it”. Country music stars, no less than founding fathers, liked the romance of the place. Tracy Lawrencedreamsof a Gulf of Mexico filled with whiskey. Johnny Cash wanted todumphis blues down in the Gulf.But Trump says it’s time for a change, that the great bay should be called the Gulf of America. He signed anexecutive ordermaking it so, emphasizing the Gulf’s economic importance to the US. Trump’s right. If the intensive extraction of riches from a patch of nature bestows proprietary rights over that patch, then the Gulf belongs to the US. For more than a century, its industries have drilled, fracked and fished it to such an intense degree it’s a wonder there’s any oil, gas or seafood left to be had.Many who work and live in Louisiana and Texas have their own name for the place. They call it the industrial coast, a region where gas flare-offs burn 24/7, where fracking blowoutsblazeuntil the vapor runs out and where rusting pipes and tall stacks billowing black and brown smoke are organic to the landscape – present at the creation, not oftheworld but ofourworld today, dominated by petrochemical and petroleum companies.What is happening in Los Angeles is our future | Francine ProseRead moreMarine oil drilling in the Gulf started in 1938, atop a wooden platform resting on pine pilings driven down into 14 ft of water, about a mile off Creole, Louisiana. Now, with shallow oil fields nearly depleted, Shell, British Petroleum, Exxon and other companies go into ever deeper water, with ever longer drills, to dig wells into the ocean floor, forcing chemicals into ancient rock to frack for oil and gas. Every year, “ultra-deep” maritime sources of petroleum make up a larger percentage of US oil production.Off-shore oil drilling no longer relies on “platforms” fixed to the seabed. The industry instead builds enormous floating complexes, or hubs comprising drill ships, semi-submersible units tethered to the sea floor with ropes and chains and floating production and storage systems including tanker-like vessels. They look like floating factories, sporting killer names such as Mad Dog, Argos, Thunder Horse and Atlantis. Shell’s Perdido hub bobs 200 miles south of Galveston, at outer edge of the US’ maritime jurisdiction, running 22 wells connected by 27 miles of pipes that can handle 100,000 barrels of oil a day. The investment in this infrastructure is enormous, second only to the expected profits.The risks are equally enormous. The farther out, the deeper down, the harder it is to contain a spill or blowout. In 2004, Hurricane Ivan blew down a Taylor Energy platform, opening a crater spewing oil and gas. Just 11 miles off the coast of Louisiana, and only 475 ft above the seabed, Taylor found it impossible to contain the rupture, which to this day still spills crude oil and gas into the Gulf. The leak is expected to continue for at least a century more.BothMexicoand Cuba drill for oil offshore, and Mexico’s Bay of Campeche, in the south-western Gulf, is in bad shape. In 1979, an exploratory offshore rig exploded, resulting in a disastrous spill. To this day, oil slicks from that spill can be found in Mexico’s mangrove estuaries. Yet petroleum contamination in Mexico is limited by technological limitations. Pemex, Mexico’s nationalized oil company, doesn’t have the machinery to drill and frack as intensively and extensively as US companies do.Nor, as of now at least, does it have the desire. Mexico’s president, Claudia Sheinbaum, has criticized what she calls an “obsession” with deep-water drilling and has halted policies by past administrations to extend leases to foreign companies to operate far off shore.Trump, and other Republicans, ran on that obsession. “Drill, baby, drill”. Nearly all the US’s offshore oil drilling takes place in the Gulf, which yields more than 650m barrels of crude a year. Oil companies don’t want to expand to increase this output. To do so would drive downprices. Rather, they want to expand to push back petroleum’s horizon, to make sure the sun doesn’t set on fossil fuel production. If the investment is made, if the infrastructure is built and highly capitalized hubs like BP’s Mad Dog are up and running, it will be hard, in the future, to give up burning fossil fuel, no matter how many solar panels China sells to third world countries.For decades oil companies in the Gulf built their rigs and ran their wells with little oceanographic oversight. The bulk of federal research dollars went to Woods Hole to study the Atlantic and Scripps to focus on the Pacific. That changed on 20 April 2010, when a mix of methane, drill-bit lubricant and water exploded, taking down British Petroleum’s Deepwater Horizon – a fifth-generation ultra-deepwater semi-submersible rig operating 50 miles off Louisiana and atop 5,000ft of water. The blast killed 10 workers and opened a hole in the sea floor that gushed oil for months, in what was the Gulf’s worst environmental disaster to date.The farther out, the deeper down, the harder it is to contain a spill or blowoutAs part of the settlement negotiated with the Obama administration, BP paid, in addition to fines and clean-up costs, half a billion dollars to set up a research fund to study the effect offshore drilling has on marine life.What researchers learned was disturbing. One decade-longstudy, headed by a University of South Florida marine biologist, Steven Murawski, found that a significant amount of oil had settled on the bed of the Gulf, a product not just of the Deepwater Horizon spill but of thousands of rusting rigs, leaking pipes and past spills. Storms and tides regularly agitate this film, “resuspending” oil in water columns, where it is sucked in by species that swim closer to the surface. Researchers sampled thousands of fish comprising nearly a 100 species, from deep-sea game to the catfish and flounder found in Louisiana’s brackish bayou. “We actually haven’t found one oil-free fish yet,” said Murawski in 2020.Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) are the most toxic elements of crude oil, and they were found in every fish Murawski’s researchers tested, with the fast-swimming yellowfin, or Ahi, tuna clocking extremely high levels. The Gulf of Mexico is among the nation’s most profitable fisheries, second in volume only to Alaska. It’s also among the most overfished. Sturgeon are threatened and the bluefin tuna population is “near collapse”. But there’s plenty of “oil-laden” yellowfin, which every day is shipped to the nation’s canneries and restaurants.Offshore oil and gas drilling creates what is called “produced water”, which comes up out of the well with oil and gas condensates, and then is discharged back into the sea. Produced water is pure poison, comprised of heavy metals and radioactive materials, including Radium 226, which has half-life of 1,600 years. For every barrel of oil extracted, about a barrel and a half worth of produced water is dumped back into the Gulf, a staggering volume of highly carcinogenic liquid.The poison comes from every direction, with more toxic waste released into the Gulf of Mexico than into any other comparable body of water. The Gulf of Mexico catches the outflow of the mighty Mississippi, which includes PCBs, dioxins, lead, mercury and phosphorus released by the refineries, factories and plantations that line the river. Louisiana’s coast is a filigree of coves, marshes and wetlands, many of which are highly polluted. A growinghypoxic dead zone– water with little or no oxygen where few living things can survive – exists off the coast of Louisiana. Now the size of New Jersey, the dead zone roughly doubles every year.And the water is getting hotter. The American Meteorological Society recently reported that over the last half-century, the Gulf’s water temperatures have been rising twice as fast as those of the Atlantic, damaging reefs, accelerating hypoxia, destroying phytoplankton, intensifying hurricanes and stressing marine life.Rice’s whales, a species unique to the Gulf, have fallen below 100 in number.Terrestrial life is under equal assault. The most vulnerable people live in Mississippi and Louisiana, the poorest and sickest states in the union. Cancer Alley – a chain of river parishes running about 90 miles along the Mississippi from the Gulf to Baton Rouge that is home to hundreds of oil refineries and petrochemical plants – posts the highest rate of cancer from industrial pollution in the US, seven times the national average. In Iberville parish last October, residents were told to shelter in place after an ExxonMobil pipeline carrying ethyleneexploded, which couldn’t be repaired until the gas in the pipeline had been burned off.Similar “shelter in place” warnings are regular occurrences in Cancer Alley, as industrial accidents occur frequently in plants that transform ethane, propane, butane, alumina and methane into industrial chemicals, pesticides and aluminum. Residents think the plants that make plastics are the most lethal. “We’re dying from inhaling the industries’ pollution,” Sharon Lavigne, a St James parish resident,toldHuman Rights Watch, “I feel like it’s a death sentence. Like we are getting cremated, but not getting burnt.”The industry ... cares less about new leases and fields than it does government support to move ahead with massive new petrochemical infrastructure projects, especially plastic factories ...Such cancerous “sacrifice zones” range along the Gulf coast, from Mississippi toTexas, their residents suffering from high rates of miscarriages, preterm births and defects, chronic rashes, persistent asthma and other illnesses, including now due to global warming,tropical diseases and parasitessuch dengue and equine encephalitis. The residents of Reserve, Louisiana, live in the shadow of Pontchartrain Works, the only factory in the country that makes synthetic rubber neoprene. They suffer “extremely improbable” high cancer rates. Poverty aggravates illnesses. About 10 million coastal residents live below the poverty line; one in 10 Black people in Louisiana and Mississippi live in conditions equal to or worse than those found in developing nations.If Trump achieves his broader, interlocking agenda, the Gulf’s miseries will multiply.The Department of Interior during Trump’s first term, from 2017 to 2021,openedsizable areas on land and sea for oil exploration and leases, including in the Gulf. The industry didn’t have time to take advantage of the generosity and stuck with safer and cheaper onshore plays in North Dakota and Texas’ Permian Basin. Trump is again pledging to do away with as many restrictions as he can on drilling and fracking.The industry, though, cares less about new leases and fields than it does government support to move ahead with massive new petrochemical infrastructure projects, especially plastic factories, in the cancer zones of Louisiana, Texas and Mississippi. Activists have been fighting plans by Formosa Plastics to build a 2,400 acre petrochemical complex, at a cost of nearly $10bn capitalized by Chase and Bank of America, in Cancer Alley’s St James Parish. Doubtful they’ll get a hearing in Trump’s Environmental Protection Agency, and the more judges Trump can appoint the more appeals they’ll lose.Over the last decade, more than 50 plastic plants have been built or expanded, many of them in the Louisiana and Texas Gulf coast where theyreceivelocal and state tax breaks equal to or more than the combined budgets of the state agencies in charge of monitoring them. ExxonMobil – which just openeda polypropylene plantin Cancer Alley – an enormous tangle of pipes, tubes, storage tanks and smoke stacks – told shareholders that it was hedging plastic against gasoline, that whatever profits the company loses to electric cars will be offset by the growing demand for plastic goods. There will always be, as the saying goes, “a great future in plastics”.Trump’s election has brought to power a generation of know-nothings – free-market, anti-DEI obsessed ideologues who are hostile to government-produced research and knowledge, be it the kind of ecological research conducted in the aftermath of the Deepwater Horizon blowout, the oversight of industrial production and expertise regarding specific animal species, including what might be causing their toxicity or endangerment. As per the recommendation of Project 2025, scientific and medical research should be left to universities or the private sector, and whole government agencies – such as the Department of the Interior’sBiological Resources Division, which does research on marine life in the Gulf, among other places – should be abolished. Trump’s freezing of money to study cancer and other diseases – which will potentially impact all citizens, but none more so than those who live in Cancer Alley – is part of this willful ignorance.Trump’s cadres don’t want to know anything about the linkages between petroleum, the environment, sickness, mortality, income and race. A Gulf researcher at a federal agency, who asked to remain anonymous, told me that her colleagues began removing, pre-emptively before Trump’s inauguration, language from their files that might rile future administrators. Anything related to the climate crisis, of course, but also, she said, any reports that used the concept “One Health” – a term adopted by federal scientists and doctors that means approaching a problem holistically by examining the “interconnection between people, animals, plants and their shared environment”. Seeing the big picture is now verboten.Ignorance is not just a Trump vice. Marine biologists who studied the Gulf on the BP half-billion-dollar fund complain that none of the oversight proposals based on their findings were adopted by the federal agencies, especially the recommendation that “produced water” discharged be routinely monitored. Every entity that flushes water into nature – your local garbage dump, for instance – is required to monitor the chemical composition of the discharge, with the findings published on the EPA website – except for oil and gas producers.Los Angeles is on fire and big oil are the arsonists | Tzeporah BermanRead moreIf there wasn’t much oversight of fracking and oil drilling, on land or sea, under the Obama and Biden administrations, there’ll soon be much less. All the many government agencies charged with mitigating the worst effects of oil, petrochemical and fishing industriesamong others – the EPA, the National Ocean and Atmospheric Administration, National Marine Fisheries Service, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, which overseas offshore leases for oil and gas – will be gutted, with what’s left staffed by loyalists. Trump says he wants to abolish or reduce the powers of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, as part of a general incapacitation of the federal government – a move that portends catastrophe, if, say, a category 5 hurricane, powered by the Gulf’s warming waters, were to hit Shell’s Perdido hub.No one, not Trump’s electoral base nor his oil industry backers, had been clamoring for the Gulf of Mexico to be rechristened the Gulf of America. But lo, Google just announced it will switch out Mexico for America on its maps.The attention to the dust-up, which naturally has drawn criticism from Mexico and Cuba, who share jurisdiction over the waters in question with the US, will be fleeting. The Gulf will return to the margins of national consciousness, until the next devastating storm or spill.BP’s half-billion-dollar fund to study oil’s effect on the ecosystem is tapped out. And, anyway, scholars in public universities – especially in red states like Florida, Mississippi, Louisiana, and Texas – will think twice about producing studies that cast Trump’s Gulf of America, and the fossil-fuel industry that poisons it, in an unflattering light.Greg Grandin is an American historian and author.

That is because they areMon 3 Feb 2025 04.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 3 Feb 2025 18.51 ESTShareWhat does the Democratic party believe in? It’s difficult to tell. In 2024, Joe Biden and then Kamala Harris ran a campaign of moderation, reconciliation and emphasis on restoring institutional norms. This failed to capture much public attention when compared with the Trump campaign’s carnival of grievance. In the months since their defeat, theDemocratshave been confused, conflicted and internally contentious over how to best proceed.The results have been contradictory and ineffectual. The Democrats have alternated between declaring Trump a fascist and a would-be dictator, and congratulating themselves on peacefully handing over the reins of power to him; they have railed against his corruption and his subordination to the unelected South African billionaire Elon Musk, but have also made themselves available to cooperate with Musk’s project to gut the federal bureaucracy and reshape it in his own interests, the initiative that has been moronically termed “Doge”.They pledge resistance to the Trumpist takeover of the state, and then pledge to work with Trump on what they insist are their shared priorities. “I suspect we can find common ground on some things,” saidGretchen Whitmer, the governor of Michigan, often cited as a future Democratic presidential candidate. “You have to look at the issues,” said Senator Bernie Sanders, the leftwing standard-bearer from Vermont. “It can’t simply be, ‘Oh, it’s a Trump idea, we oppose it.’”This is a vision of American politics in which the Democrats have no power to set the terms of the debate on their ownWhat you will notice is that this is a vision of American politics in which the Democrats have no power to set the terms of the debate on their own, or to advance their own priorities: the far right alone can make policy proposals, to which the Democrats can merely flip their thumbs up or down. Many of them are giving the thumbs up. Democrats have crossed the aisle to vote in favor of Trump’s cabinet picks, and no fewer than 12 Democratic senators voted in favor of Trump’s anti-immigrant Laken Riley Act.Gone is the fevered energy of 2017, when Trump’s first ascent to power galvanized a resurgent left wing and encouraged elected Democrats to obstruct the new president’s destructive agenda with aggressive media, legal and procedural strategies. Now, the Democrats seem less like a resistance than an acquiescence. They are not mounting any meaningful opposition to Trump’s aggressive, sadistic mission. Instead they’re rolling over, like a submissive dog showing its belly, and alternately casting this posture as either a principled commitment to constitutional order or as an unfortunate inevitability for which they can’t be blamed.Increasingly, political commentators have compared the Democrats of 2025 to the Nazi collaborationist Vichy government in second-world-war France. “It’s a regime born ofcapitulationand ofdefeat,” writesJohn Ganzof the newsletter Unpopular Front. “It’s a regime of bornexhaustion,nihilism,andcynicism: the loss of faith in the old verities of the republic.”More than anything, what Democrats seem to wish for, at the outset of the second Trump presidency, is for it to be 2012 again. They want the Obama coalition back; they want the niceties of former norms and institutional procedures; they want bipartisanship to be a virtue, and they want to be seen as reasonable, pragmatic and dispassionate. They want Trump, and the changes to our political world that his ascent has ushered in, to never have happened.View image in fullscreenThe House Democratic leader, Hakeem Jeffries, with the House speaker, Mike Johnson.Photograph: Aaron Schwartz/NurPhoto/Rex/ShutterstockThe far right, restored to power over the past two weeks, is said to be setting out to reverse the 20th century, undoing its progress for racial equality, women’s rights, queer dignity and freedom, and democratic fairness. But if theRepublicansare seeking to reverse the 20th century, the Democrats seem to wish to simply ignore the 21st. Their strategies and impulses, their vision of how American politics works, no longer function in the present. Instead of adapting to the future, they seem to be sticking their heads in the sand, and waiting for the return of the past.DNC to elect new chair as party grapples with how to rebuild after 2024 lossesRead moreThis is why the Democrats have not adjusted to the new age of political communications, in which voters can be animated and convinced by their information environment: Democrats tack to the right, over and over, and use traditional media like newspapers, cable news and press releases to show off their new positions and distance themselves from their old ones. Voters don’t see it; they are too busy on social media, where Republicans are deftly setting the agenda that the Democrats can only feebly follow, chasing their opponents to the right even further. The result is that the party has not advocated its own actual worldview for years: Democrats have not shown a set of social values, or a theory of governance, or anything like a commitment to principle. They have not stood up for targeted groups, or articulated a real vision of democracy; they have never picked a bold fight, and they have never taken a stand that they don’t back down from when Republicans oppose it. No wonder the American public, when it thinks of Democrats at all, tends to think of them as out of touch, opportunistic and cowardly. That is because they are.The result is not so much that the Democrats are a weaker party as that they are not much of a party at all: it is the extremist Republicans, and they alone, who are communicating a vision of America to the public, and the whimpering, servile politicians who pass for an “opposition” never counter with their own vision but only whisper, barely audible, the feeble response: “Not so far.”What Democrats need, now, is to discover their spine, and to articulate a set of values that they do not flinch from. The point is not to try to feign positions that they think the electorate already shares: the point is to take a stand with principle and integrity, and to let that guide draw the voters to them.Elections are popularity contests, and the way to be popular is not through policy, but through personal robustness, through a willingness to put up a fight. If Democrats fight what they have long believed were losing battles – trans rights and abortion; healthcare and childcare; education; social security; good, union jobs – they might find that it is the fighting itself that proves persuasive. They have already tried compromise; they have already tried capitulation. It is time to try defiance.Moira Donegan is a Guardian US columnistExplore more on these topicsUS politicsOpinionDemocratsRepublicansDonald TrumpcommentShareReuse this content"

Imperialism? Alliances with billionaires? Those shocked at the president’s early moves have forgotten what came beforeMon 3 Feb 2025 01.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 3 Feb 2025 09.45 ESTShareThe dust briefly settled, only for it to be kicked up once again. Donald Trump’sflurry of executive orders– causing chaos on everything from foreign aid to world trade – is rapidly rocking and reshaping domestic and foreign policy. And the temptation is, yet again, to think of Donald Trump as an exogenous shock to US democracy. But look closer, and you will see not a rogue president taking a hammer to a hitherto stable political order, but a history of the erosion of norms that paved the way for him.Political norms are the scaffolding of democracy, enforced not by the law, but by a sort of social consensus. They are not codified, strict mechanisms for regulating political facts – such as the separation of powers – but the agreement that such things should be respected and observed. A clear case in point is the president’s ability to issue pardons. And Joe Biden’spardoning of his family memberswas as much an injury to norms asTrump’s pardoningof those convicted after 6 January.“We talk about America’s system of government,” New York Times columnist Ezra Kleinsaid after Trump’s inauguration, “as if it is a solid thing, bound by the constitution and institutions the way a belt cinches around the waist. But it’s really just a pile of norms in a trenchcoat. Knock the norms down and everything changes.” Trump’s very purpose is to knock them down, but in some ways, he is only accelerating a process that had already started.Take Trump’s order to construct amigrant detention centrein Guantánamo Bay – a space that has for years operated outside international law despite outcries and appeals for closure. Hundreds of prisoners were kept there under military law, often following rendition, disappearance andtorture at CIA black sites. Trump’s proposal to detain tens of thousands of migrants there is an outrageous move, but it is not an aberration. He is building, literally, on what came before him.In Trump’s fantasy politics, he can accomplish anything – but reality will prevail | Andy BeckettRead more“Like many of Trump’s authoritarian attacks on human rights, this one has shameful precedents in US history,” Vince Warren, executive director of the Center for Constitutional Rights,told CNN. “Long before the second Bush administration used the facility to hold and abuse nearly 800 Muslim men and boys as part of its ‘war on terror’, the first Bush administration held Haitian refugees there to try to deny them their rights under international law.” The prison, in fact, currently houses detained migrants in a facility called theMigrant Operations Center. Last year, the Biden administrationawarded a private contractorover $160m (£130m) to run the facility.Another of Trump’s directives also builds on precedent. One of his executive orders pledges todeport studentsand others without US citizenship who participate in pro-Palestine protests. But their actions were already condemned and over-policed way before Trump was re-elected. Don’t forget that the Democratsblocked requestsfor a Palestinian speaker at their convention, and across the country “liberal” academic institutions expelled students for protesting,withheld their degrees, andcalled in armed policeto dismantle their sit-ins.The same goes for Trump’s withdrawal from international organisations such as the World Health Organization and hisimperial adventurismwhen it comes to foreign policy. The US has a long record, under much more gentlemanly presidents, of breaking international law,insulting international institutions and embarking on unilateral campaigns licensed by its superpower status. Over two decades ago, Congresspassed a lawauthorising “all means necessary and appropriate” to “free US or allied personnel detained by or on behalf of the International Criminal Court”. It was dubbed the Hague Invasion Act.The “war on terror” was itself one long, disastrous, norm-busting campaign. A week before the US and its allies invaded Iraq, the United Nations secretary general warned them that military action would be a violation of the UN charter.Even optically, Trump’s alliances with tech billionaires is crude and visible, but it mirrors the billionaires and influencers who flocked to Kamala Harris’s campaign,more of whompublicly backed her than Trump. Bidencontinued the practiceof previous presidents, Republican and Democrat, of tapping up super-rich donors for ambassadorial positions before Trump made the quid pro quo explicit with his cabinet of billionaires. And even the liberal argument that Trump’s mere temperament, character and disposition is self-disqualifying runs up against the fact of his predecessor. Biden’s stubborn clinging on to power, and people being asked to ignore their very eyes and ears as his capacities faded, proved that contempt for the public’s intelligence is not the preserve of the right.This is not to suggest thatthere is no difference between Trump and his predecessors, or that anyone is under any illusion that the US was a perfect democracy before his arrival on the scene. I do not mean to minimise the president’s violations and their material impact, most of all his lack of adherence to a peaceful transition of power – a super norm, if you will. But the American dream of prosperity at home and supremacy abroad has long masked a much more cynical and transactional order – one that Trump is both exposing and entrenching.The danger comes from assuming that Trumpism comes out of nowhere. In fact, it comes from many sources, but one of them is his predecessors’ creation of a political system in which serial breachesare seen as acceptable because they are done by the right people. Well, to millions of people, Trump is the right person.Nesrine Malik is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionUS politicsTrump administrationJoe BidenKamala HarriscommentShareReuse this content"

Hey presto. A manatee also happens to be the grey of all play-dough colours mixed together.Imagine eating lettuce underwater: the crunch, the squelch. Reading about manatees, I finally give in and look up what the word “prehensile” actually means, as in a giraffe’s prehensile tongue, a monkey’s prehensile tail, a manatee’s prehensile lips. What could these things have in common, you wonder, for 25 years. Then it is time to find out.It means they can hold, manipulate or grasp things.My prehensile mind struggles to fold itself around the shape of a manatee: I have only ever seen them in videos, where they seem to be forever filmed in pieces, revealing themselves frame by frame this way, squashing their noses against glass that way. Andeating lettuce, forever eating lettuce.Manatee squashing its nose against glass.Their skin seems to scar like play-dough too: propeller cuts that look like indentations made by giant fingernails.Manatees don’t have incisors or canines, only “cheek teeth”. No hair, only whiskers. Algae growing on their backs. Everything is gentle. They can’t turn their heads sideways: they have too few vertebrae. Everything moves as one.In A Father’s Work is Never Done, a poem by Nathan Hoks, his father “devised this plan, we’ll stand on our heads and let the ocean wash over us. / The ocean will be a tub of mint tea. / The ocean will make the sound of a tuba and be filled with manatees”. Herman Melville, in Moby-Dick, describes so-called “pig-fish” as “a noisy, contemptible set, mostly lurking in the mouths of rivers, and feeding on wet hay”.A hadada: nothing can quite capture the sound of these birds, because it’s mainly just rude noise | Helen SullivanRead moreWhat do they sound like? Tubas? No, theysqueak and squeal. It makes no sense, and maybe that is part of the peace they seem to offer. Everything is a mess but manatees are a simple, if weird, shape. They seem to occur in videos surrounded by only two other things: green things that they eat and slightly cloudy blue water. Sometimes sunlight dapples on their backs.In A Marriage Poem by Ellen Bryant Voigt, “She wants something crisp and permanent, / like coral – a crown, a trellis, / an iron shawl across the bed”. But their marriage is at the age where she and her husband are caught between caring for their ageing parents and their children. They are more like manatees:Dearest, the beast of Loch Ness, that shy,broad-backed, two-headed creature,may be a pair of whales or manatee,male and female,driven from their deep mud nest,who cling to each other,circling the surface of the lake.Don’t try to find out whether manatees actually make mud nests. The Google results are for manatees who died in Mud River, Hernando County, Florida; and for wasps, who do make their nests with mud. The wasps really mess with the benevolence, the serenity, of thinking about nothing but a 500kg animal moving slowly through cloudy water and something green to eat.

On a recent Wednesday afternoon, the car park was full and the cafe was bustling with people my parents’ age and older, chatting over milky coffees and slices of cake. The retired ladies who talk to me in the gym changing room love to come here for a jacket potato after their aquafit class.Yet, as I stepped through the automatic doors, the plants weren’t immediately visible. First, I had to pass a bright deli counter, an area filled with homeware and crockery, shelves of fragrant toiletries, and a section of children’s toys before anything remotely connected to gardening came into view. I waded through gloves, power tools, pesticides and outdoor furniture, and then, finally, I found the annual bedding plants and potted shrubs. Here, all was quiet. The gardening section was quite unlike the busy cafe; I was alone but for one member of staff.This isn’t the type of place I tend to go looking for plants. There’s something about the floral wellies and superfluous tatof your average garden centre that I find off-putting. Curious as to whether other gardening folk felt the same way, I asked my Instagram followers whether they sought out their plants in large garden centres like this one. Over 100 people responded, sharing a surprising depth and breadth of feeling about these places – from resolute disdain to sincere warmth and fondness.Getting an allotment totally changed my summer – and radically altered my relationship with food | Diyora ShadijanovaRead moreI related most to those who said the abundance of plastic and shelves full of chemicals had put them off garden centres. “I think they perpetuate all the ways the gardening industry is screwing up the environment,” one gardener named Emma told me. These gardeners – myself included – favoured smaller, family-run operations, specialist nurseries and plant fairs run by dedicated, experienced plantspeople who could offer advice and inspiration. A number of people told me they preferred to know how and where plants were grown before buying them; ideally, they bought plants propagated locally, without chemicals, certainly notusing peat, which releases substantial amounts of CO2when it’s extracted from the ground. Another gardener, Harry, told me that his nearby garden centre continued selling peat and the environmentally harmful herbicide glyphosate, which seemed “woefully behind the times”.Even so, most people described garden centres as joyful places where they like to spend time with their families, gather ideas for the gardens they hope to grow, have a good look at plants before investing in them and – yes – enjoy some coffee and cake. One respondent even described those in rural areas “as a core civic space”. Given all this, it might seem surprising that some garden centres are closing down. Both Dobbies and Homebase have announced the closure of a number of their sites in recent months.One of the reasons for this, proposed in arecent Daily Mail article, is that young people are to blame. It claimed gen Z are visiting garden centres for the cafes, candles and cuddly toys but are failing to drop enough cash to keep these businesses afloat. Yet look a little closer, and it becomes clear that young people areinterested in plants. According toone survey, 83% of 18 to 34-year-olds think gardening is “cool”. Given that most younger people are less likely toown a home(let alone a garden) of their own than previous generations, that’s a welcome surprise. And since gen Zs and millennials are far more concerned about theclimate crisisthan older generations, it follows that they would be looking for ways to garden that align with their values, mirroring the sector-wide trend towards nature-centred approaches to gardening.There are many prominent gardeners – including RHS Chelsea gold medal-winning garden designer,Tom Massey– who represent a broader shift away from gardening as a purely aesthetic practice, and instead create gardens that are nature-centric as well as beautiful (and delicious, if they grow edible plants as I do). Instead of obliterating insects with pesticides and uprooting so-called weeds, many of the gardeners I know and admire engage in gentle, considered cultivation, where tidiness is eschewed in favour of a nurtured wildness that is welcoming to wildlife. Ecological home growerPoppy Okotchaand edible gardenerHuw Richardsboth exemplify how younger gardeners are embracing a more holistic horticultural approach.I find that being more environmentally conscious in the way I garden compels me to interrogate the choices I make both for the green spaces I steward and in my life beyond. Learning the alchemy of propagation, creating new plants from cuttings, growing crop from seed or splitting a mature plant into multiple new ones to share for your fellow gardeners are remarkable experiences that have encouraged me to decouple my gardening practices from the consumerism of garden centres.Similarly, I’d urge new young gardeners to find ways to garden without emptying their bank accounts. Perhaps what makes gardening meaningful can’t simply be bought in a garden centre.Claire Ratinon is an organic food grower and writerExplore more on these topicsGardensOpinionOrganic gardeningPesticidesWildlifecommentShareReuse this content"

Then I turned off my phone and embraced the silenceKrissi DriverThe cacophony around me seemed to drown out my daily worries until a writing retreat showed me there was a better wayMon 3 Feb 2025 05.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 3 Feb 2025 11.25 ESTShareI’velived in South Koreafor more than a decade, but it’s only recently that I discovered just how loud it is here. The bing-bong when someone presses the “stop” button on the city bus, and the accompanying sing-songy announcements in Korean, the beeps of riders scanning their transit cards to board or depart; soju-drunk office workers loudly singing off-tune through neighbourhood alleyways; obnoxiously loud K-pop music blaring out of storefronts; and songs that seem to change key at record rates as delivery motorbikes speed out of range.In reality, I have relied on there being near-constant cacophony around me for the whole of my adult life. Without realising it, background noise became a kind of comfort to me, making me feel less alone. It started after university when I was barely scraping together a living, working jobs I didn’t want to be doing. I would soothe my loneliness and isolation in the evenings by playing endless hours of Law & Order: Special Victims Unit just for the ambient sound – the comfort of Detectives Olivia Benson and Elliot Stabler bringing criminals of the worst kind to justice.Years later, in Korea, I was much happier, but I still wanted to drown out the reality of the $60,000 of student loans I felt like I was spending a lifetime paying off and my feelings of impostor syndrome. So I bought all 10 seasons of Friends.Listening to Ross and Rachel argue in the background about being “on a break” while I did other things silenced the niggling voice in my head telling me I was, at best, average at everything and never going to dig my way out of debt.After the results of the 2016 US election, things became even more extreme. I constructed my own iPhone surround sound system and I began filling every silence – from taking a shower to washing the dishes to folding laundry – with segment after segment from MSNBC or CNN. I knew the anchors’ names and reporters’ voices.It was rarely quiet around me, yet I barely noticed. Then in 2023, I went to a solo writing retreat to avoid distractions at home. I started writing fiction again for the first time in more than a decade, and it feltincredible. I felt like I’d accomplished something creative for the first time in a long time. But the penny still hadn’t dropped.When I got home, the nonstop noise started up again. I didn’t realise how much “harmless background noise” was hurting me until one day I noticed the sound of silence. Standing in the shower without my phone playing something in the background, I suddenly realised I couldhear myself think. Ideas flew to me – phrases and lines I wanted to use in fiction short stories, inspiration for pitches to send to publications. I had been unwittingly drowning my creativity in a self-made sea of sound and I realised I had to stop.The noise wasn’t just killing my creativity; it was crushing my productivity. Every project I took on from a client or creative thoughts I wanted to get down “on paper” took twice as long. Ideas came slower or not at all. None of us are strangers to the negative effects of sound.Studies have shownthat noise pollution plays a role in common health issues like heart disease and high blood pressure, along with surprising ones like low birth weight. One researcher has even gone so far as to describe our sound obsession as “aural litter”: “If you could see what you hear, it would look like piles and piles of McDonald’s wrappers, just thrown out the window as we go driving down the road.”I’m no scientist, but it seems clear to me that the more sound we allow to surround us as a society, the less connected we become to one another. We lose our desire to truly converse with our friends or partners, replacing our relationships with podcasts, talkshows, and never-ending social and news updates. We rely more and more on external input rather than looking within ourselves, cutting off our inner telephone wires and forgetting the sound of our intuitive voices – the ones that drive our decisions, creativity and how we view the world around us.I was terrified of being the last single woman left among my friends. Then I made peace with it | Édaein O’ ConnellRead moreRealising what my noise habit was doing to me was the wake-up call I needed. I’ve drastically cut down on YouTube. I no longer take my phone into the shower, don’t listen to news clips while doing chores, and avoid having my earbuds in while I’m walking or commuting. I limit “writing background noise” to instrumental music, if anything at all. And when I’m tempted to turn something on that I know won’t help me, I pack up my MacBook and head to a favourite coffee shop for a few hours to work instead. Sometimes, I simply sit in silence for a few minutes and let my mind wander – to reallyfeelit and the impact it’s made on my writing life.On election night 2024, I happened to be home in the US. Walking through Times Square in New York City on the way back to my hotel, I watched screens scroll through early presidential results. I took out my phone and turned on a “no news” focus I’d made weeks before. I didn’t want to be pulled in by the horror I assumed was coming; I wanted to preserve the quiet space I’d finally found and keep it sacred.These moments shouldn’t have been such epiphanic discoveries, but they were: I need – no,crave– more silence in my life. My creativity suffocates without it. Sometimes, it’s still difficult to choose silence over noise, but the outcome is well worth the sacrifice of sound.Krissi Driver is a writer based in South KoreaExplore more on these topicsSouth KoreaWhy I quitPollutionUrbanisationAsia PacificcommentShareReuse this content"

I will be surrounded, I expect, by thousands of fellow middle-aged men lustily singing “You and I are gonna live forever” –while knowing some of us won’t even make it through the decade.Lately I have noticed that much of the music I listen to and the gigs I attend now have their roots in the past. I first saw Oasis when I was 23, and mygreatest hopefor this summer’s concert is that it might briefly transport me back to the 1990s.I saw Pulp in 2023and it was incredible – but mostly because it brought back memories of seeing the band decades ago. The same goes for Bruce Springsteen and Bob Dylan, who I saw last year. For my generation, gigs seem to function as temporary time machines that give you a chance to revisit the glory days.The only concert I attended last year that wasnotdrenched in nostalgia wasTaylor Swift’s Eras tour. It was the most successful tour in history, and Swift is the biggest pop star on the planet, so it should not be entirely surprising that I had a total blast at the shows (yes, I went twice). But, according to some, I had no business even being there. Arecent surveysuggested that four in 10 of people between 25 and 34 think the idea of people in their 50s and 60s attending a Swift gig is embarrassing. It made me wonder how I would have felt, when I went to see Madonna in 1990 as a 19-year-old, if I had spotted anyone in their 50s in the audience. I suspect I would have thought they were quite cool.I have never cared about musical snobbery. When I was in my late teens I went to see Billy Joel on the River of Dreams tour while my friends were seeingthe Stone Roses at Spike Island. (In 2013 I went to see Ian Brown at Finsbury Park in London to try to recall a youth I had never had.) In my early 20s I would go, inevitably alone, to see the likes of the Everly Brothers, Lou Reed and Tin Machine. I did so because I loved the music – or David Bowie in the case of Tin Machine – whether it was considered cool or embarrassing. That does not mean I cannot hazard a guess as to why some younger people may feel it is a little shameful to be in your 50s or 60s and enjoying music that is so obviously aimed at a much younger audience.You and I are gonna live forever: why 2024’s pop was all about sharing the momentRead moreIn an age where music seems increasingly split down generational lines, crossing them can reek of the musical version of a midlife crisis. The vast majority of the audience at the Swift concert was young, female and sporting rather more glitter than me, but I did not feel at all uncomfortable because I was there to accompany my daughter, Laila – and anyone who might have glanced over to me would have firmly put me in the “Swiftie dad” box and carried on singing. If I had gone alone I would have been much more self-conscious. In effect, I am in a codependent relationship with my daughter – she needs a parent to go with her to concerts and I need a child. I am dreading the day she is old enough to go to them without me.When Laila was very young I influenced her musical tastes – which is why she wanted to see Springsteen and Paul McCartney with me – but now she is influencing mine. She introduced me to Swift, Sabrina Carpenter andChappell Roan, as well as less well-known bands such as Sunday (1994). I could claim I only listen to these artists for the sake of a closer relationship with Laila, but the truth is that I really like their music. I feel grateful to have been introduced by my daughter to these artists because otherwise my musical diet would have remained largely unchanged since the 1990s – and be all the poorer for it.The first time I saw Oasis on stage was at the Haçienda in 1994. My abiding memory of that gig is feeling a rush of euphoria and joy. Swift’s music may, to quote an artist from my generation, say nothing to me about my life, but it is smart and sophisticated, and watching her on stage I felt that same rush of euphoria and joy. It felt thrilling to be among young people happily creating their formative musical memories, and it felt liberating to be at a concert focused on the present, rather than looking back to a youth now half a world away.Sarfraz Manzoor is an author, broadcaster and screenwriterDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The unthinkable is now more possibleMon 3 Feb 2025 02.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 3 Feb 2025 04.26 ESTShareThe tectonic plates are shifting in German politics. Amomentous past weekhas plunged the country into uncertainty – and not just about the outcome of the snap general election on 23 February. The mainstream parties are at each other’s throats, while the far-right Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) is jubilant.The firewall (“Brandmauer”) against the extreme right, which has held since the end of the second world war,is showing big cracks. Europe’s most powerful country may be entering a phase of democratic instability.All of this is the result of a spectacular miscalculation by the opposition leader, Friedrich Merz, leader of the centre-right Christian Democrats (CDU) and frontrunner to become Germany’s next chancellor.Seeking to take a firm stance on immigration, after a knife attackby an Afghan asylum seekerthat killed two people, including a toddler, Merz proposed a series of measures to tighten Germany’s borders, empowering the federal police and fast-tracking deportations. Polls show high support, including among Social Democrat (SPD), Green and Liberal voters, for restricting immigration; while a series of violent assaults, the deadliest on aChristmas market in December, killing six and injuring hundreds, has rattled the country. Merz, it seemed, had found an issue that gave his campaign traction.But then – perhaps carried away by positive feedback – he decided to push two motions through the Bundestag. Merz claimed that he would not actively seek the votes of the AfD, but nor would he shy away from a majority with their support. At the same time, he added strong language against the AfD into the drafts, seemingly to make the motions unpalatable for them. Obviously, the idea was to increase pressure on the SPD and the Greens to support his proposals.The gamble did not work out.Alice Weidel is the presentable face of the AfD. And the one its opponents should fear the most | Katja HoyerRead moreThe AfD leadership realising that Merz had handed it an opportunity to split the political centre, sided with the CDU. Their votes helped Merz’s first motion, last Wednesday,to secure a narrow parliamentary majority.Uproar ensued and 48 hours later, the second motion, on Friday,failed to pass, after arebellionfrom within Merz’s ranks and a rare intervention by the former chancellor and CDU leader, Angela Merkel. To add insult to injury, the AfD co-leader Alice Weidel humiliated Merz publicly, deriding him as a weak figure who had just been undermined by his own party.The episode was an unmitigated disaster: Merz has emboldened the AfD and damaged his own credibility. Moreover, he shattered a taboo central to postwar German political culture by breaking thenorm of non-cooperation with the extreme right in any capacity. It is hard to overstate this moment’s significance.It is a poor excuse that none of it was Merz’s intention. By failing to shun the votes of a party suspected of being an extremist organisationby German intelligence agenciesto get his immigration proposals adopted, Merz reneged on a vow of non-cooperation. In November, he had publicly declared the CDU wouldnever vote with the AfD, nor even accept “coincidental majorities” with them.Merz’s attempt to pressure the Social Democrats and the Greensbackfired. He has also handed their leaders, Olaf Scholz and Robert Habeck, a mobilising issue for their flailing campaigns: resisting the Christian Democrats’ normalisation of the far right.But how did we get here? Merz is an old-fashioned Christian Democrat – pro-market, pro-Nato, pro-European. He is not a populist, nor is he a nationalist or a bigot. And yet, in a failed attempt to blackmail the centre-left competition and outsmart the AfD, he has made the campaign about his capacity for leadership and trustworthiness. What is his promise that he will never be elected chancellor with the votes of the AfD worth now?It is crucial to understand that the CDU and its Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union(CSU), are not just typical conservative or centre-right parties like others in western democracies.The German Christian Democrats rose from the ashes of their failed Weimar predecessors, the bourgeois-nationalist parties that underestimated or even supported the Nazis.Konrad Adenauer, first leader of the CDU and first longtime chancellor of the Bundesrepublik, was deeply conservative but an anti-fascist – and steered the right away from its anti-democratic leanings. True, he also integrated many old Nazis into his party, but that followed his instincts that former fellow travellers could be re-educated and re-directed. Adenauer would never have thought about forming a majority with anti-democratic forces in parliament.View image in fullscreenAfD chairperson Alice Weidel arrives to deliver a speech during an election campaign event in Neu-Isenburg, Germany, 1 February 2025.Photograph: Ronald Wittek/EPAThe CDU, therefore, is crucial for the democratic stability of Germany. It is incorrect to say that the party had a firewall policy – it was the firewall. It has long given a home to conservatives of all stripes while drawing the line at those who deny or relativise the Holocaust. The prospect that the CDU will, or can, no longer contain and represent Germany’s rightwing forces is frightening.Almost daily, the AfD calls into question the German “culture of remembrance” – the consensus that facing up to thecrimes of the Nazi pastis fundamental. Worryingly, it has recently found a powerful partner in these efforts. In a video address at an AfD campaign event on 25 January, Elon Muskurged the crowdnot to be constrained by “too much focus on past guilt”. He spoke only hours before the 80th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz, and his appeal to “move on” was applauded by the party faithful.Merz – and the broad mainstream of his party – has nothing to do with this kind of revisionism. The criticism levelled against him by leading Social Democrats during Friday’s debate (“you opened the gates of hell”) is over the top. He has no dark designs to bring the extreme right into government. He is honest when he says he aims to shrink, downgrade and sideline them.But this makes it even more baffling that he has manoeuvred himself into a position where he depends on the very forces that he wants to marginalise.Last week, Germany’s mainstream parties showed that they cannot work together. The mutual recriminations have reached a level that will make it hard to find compromises after the election. In the German representative parliamentary system, the readiness to form coalitions is essential.And if coalition talks between the mainstream parties fail, Germany may be heading for a conservative minority government informally held up by the far right. This would be destabilising not just for Germany, but for the whole continent. Much depends on the coming weeks. It is not too late for the centre to reassert itself. But on the current trajectory, we are heading for turbulent times.Jörg Lau is an international correspondent for the German weekly Die ZeitDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

And the flood waters were still rising, with rain set to continue.With reports of up to one metre of rainfall in parts of north-eastQueensland, the heaviest rain has fallen between Lucinda to Townsville in northern Queensland as the Bureau of Meteorology warns the big wet will continue for days.Ingham and nearby towns, about 100km fromTownsville, are some of the worst hit areas, with residents experiencing flooding from the Herbert River.The continued deluge has led to swollen waterways with major flood warnings in place for the Herbert River, the Ross and Bohle River, the Horton River and the Upper Burdekin River.With more heavy rain forecast for the next 24 hours, the Herbert is likely to break the 1967 record of15.2 metres.Queensland’s premier, David Crisafulli – who grew up on his family’s sugar cane farm in Ingham –has saidthe floods will be a “once-in-a-century” event for the town.Authorities saythe town has lost power and an extended outage is likely.Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailThe atmospheric factors behind these floods are similar to previous floods in the region – and climate change is no doubt playing a role.Where are the floods hitting?For many people in Townsville – the largest city in northern Australia – the unfolding emergency will bring back memories of thedevastating February 2019 floods, which caused $1.24bnin damage. Residents have beenasked to evacuatefrom several low-lying suburbs which were inundated in 2019.It is too early to say if this flood will be worse. Fortunately, water levels in the city’sRoss River Damare much lower than 2019. Townsville airport recorded 545mm of rain over the 48 hours to Sunday morning, with many north-west suburbs recording much higher levels. The township of Rollingstone – 60km north-west of Townsville – recorded a whopping 702mm over the 24 hours to 9am Sunday.Further north in the Cairns to Daintree region, residents are watching with concern, with many still raw after the record-breaking floods ofDecember 2023.What’s behind these floods?The 2025 extreme rainfall event, the2019 Townsville floodsand the2023 Cairns and Daintree floodsare remarkably similar in many ways.What triggered each of these floods was prolonged heavy rain falling on the south-east flank of a stationary tropical low weather system. Normally, tropical lows bring wind and rain but move through quite quickly. But now some of these systems are stalling,sitting in placeover or near land and dumping huge volumes of rain.Last week the Bureau of Meteorology warned that five tropical lowswere formingaround northern Australia. Most tropical cyclones form from tropical lows embedded in the region’smonsoon trough, a large low pressure band which forms over summer and draws in warm, moist air from the adjacent tropical seas.But significant rain events like this one don’t necessarily require a tropical cyclone. Slow-moving deep monsoon lows over land can also deliverhuge amounts of rain and widespread flooding.These atmospheric conditions allow intense rain bands to form between converging winds: warm, moist winds from the north-east and south-east winds originating from the Coral Sea. As the winds collide, they push the moist air up into the cooler parts of the atmosphere where it condenses and falls as torrential rain.More extreme rainfall and higher frequencies of flooded rivers and flash floods around the world have a clear link to climate change andglobal heating.The main drivers behind these events include warming of the atmosphere. For every 1C of warming, the atmosphere holds7% more water vapour. Research suggests this figure could beeven higherfor short-duration rainfall.Hotter oceans hold more energy, meaning they can also amplify the global water cycle.This year’s late monsoonThis year sea surface temperatures in the north-west Coral Sea are1C to 2C above average. Ocean temperatures have risen because of a lack of cloud cover and rain last month. In north-western Australia, this hasgiven riseto an intensifying marine heatwave.This ocean heat is likely to be driven by the Australian monsoon’slatest recorded arrival. Themonsoonbrings heavy rains to northern Australia, triggering the wet season. When it arrives, sea surface temperatures generally drop due to a combination of high cloud cover and the cooling effect of rainwater.After a slow start, the north Australian monsoon season is now in full swing.The Bureau of Meteorology is monitoring an active monsoon trough for any low-pressure systems, which may develop into tropical cyclones over the next week or so. If a cyclone does form, it will gain energy from warmer than usualsea surface temperatures.What’s next for north Queensland?The flood emergency in north Queensland is far from over. Allglobal circulation modelspredict that heavy rain will continue in the region, extending up towards Cape York and the gulf country as a monsoon surge moves in from Indonesia.As river catchments get saturated, more and more water will run off and engorge rivers. Forecasts are for rain to continuefor the next few days. We are likely to see more flooding in more places this week.For the latest updates, check the Bureau of Meteorology’sQueensland flood warnings,ABC Emergencyor local ABC radio stations.This articleoriginally appeared in the Conversation.

Has it made them rethink their own love lives?Mon 3 Feb 2025 11.07 ESTLast modified on Mon 3 Feb 2025 11.34 ESTShareBefore Nicola Walker andStephen Manganappeared on The One Show last year to promote the Christmas special of their BBC divorce drama The Split, they were warned not to go into too much detail about their next project: Mike Bartlett’s three-hander Unicorn, in which they play Polly and Nick, a married couple who bring a younger woman called Kate into their relationship.Walker, joined by her co-stars in an empty London theatre bar, sets the scene: “We were told: ‘This is a tea-time show, so don’t say anything about the, um, sexual nature of the play.’” The three actors are seated today in a row behind a table, rather as if they are interviewing me for a job. Sandwiched between Walker and Mangan, suitably enough, is Erin Doherty, who starred as Princess Anne in The Crown and will complete the on-stage throuple.The thing about Polly and Nick, and it’s a crucial element, is that they are still deeply in love after all these yearsWalker looked unimpressed when The One Show’s hosts referred to Unicorn as “racy”. What would be a better description? “Provocative,” says Mangan. “Or explicit.” Preciselyhowexplicit remains to be seen. The sex inCock, Bartlett’s 2009 playabout a different kind of love triangle, was expressed verbally rather than physically, whereas one stage direction in Unicorn reads: “They have sex.” Is it a coincidence that this occurs on page 69 of the script? “I didn’t notice that!” shrieks Doherty. Mangan raises an eyebrow. “You’ve unlocked something there,” he says.Theatre audiences may be reassured, initially, to see Mangan and Walker happily married in the play, after all the turmoil they’ve gone through together on TV. “No one should expectThe Spliton stage,” Mangan says. “But the fact that Nicola and I are so comfortable together has been helpful. When you’re acting with someone new, it can often be like: ‘Meet Sue. You two have been married for 25 years. And –action!’”View image in fullscreen‘Well, I did cheat on you’…Mangan and Walker in The Split.Photograph: Daniel Scale /BBC/Sister PicturesIt suits the dynamic of Unicorn that Doherty, who is 32, should feel like an interloper joining this long-established fictional couple in their mid-50s. “I don’t have to imagine that situation,” she says. “Most of the time in rehearsals, it does feel – not in a horrible way – as if I’m watching something from the outside.” Walker adds: “Kate is waiting for Polly and Nick to make up their minds about what they want.”Doherty was familiar with her co-stars, having watching The Split long before she was cast in Unicorn, an admission that causes Walker to turn suddenly in her seat: “You watched The Split?” she asks. Doherty replies: “It’s not like I was going to talk to you about it! I don’t want to be that guy.” Walker shoots back: “Well, I toldyouI’d watched The Crown.”Both shows have huge fanbases, although Doherty tends not to get bothered much in public, perhaps because she looks and sounds nothing like she did while portraying Princess Anne. “And maybe,” suggests Walker, “you’re not so approachable if you’re playing a royal.” Mangan, however, has found himself upbraided by fans of The Split. “I get told off a lot for cheating onNicola Walker,” he says. “Well, I did cheat on you,” she reminds him. “That’s what I always tell them,” he replies.One difference with Polly and Nick – and it’s a crucial element in Unicorn – is that they are still deeply in love after all these years. For them, polyamory is not a sticking plaster but rather a pleasure-seeking mission, as well as an insurance policy against future stasis. The hazards of embarking on their sexual adventure with Kate are weighed up endlessly by the couple, but Unicorn is clear that there can be just as much danger in staying put, closing off options, risking stagnation. “The play isn’t saying that the way forward necessarily lies in three people,” Mangan explains. “But sometimes, if it’s therightthree people, it can work.”View image in fullscreen‘Not so approachable’…Doherty as Princess Anne in The Crown.Photograph: Des Willie/APPerhaps there will be a quantifiable Unicorn effect on the audience, with relationships branching out, or breaking up, after exposure to all the ideas in the play. “I’m curious about the reaction,” says Mangan. “It’s not the usual boy meets girl story.” He looks around the empty bar. “I expect this will be quite a lively place in the interval. People will have strong opinions about what they’ve seen.”Walker remembers that kind of atmosphere at the original London production of David Mamet’s male v female campus dramaOleannaat the Royal Court in 1993. “There was that charged feeling in the auditorium,” she marvels. “Couples disagreeing about what was going on. It would be interesting if Unicorn turned out to be provocative in that way.” Mangan adds: “I have no idea whether people are going to laugh, be appalled or be angry.” Walker offers another option: “Or be turned on.”She argues that the play’s message reaches far beyond the concept of polyamory: it’s about remaining open to new ideas, embracing change rather than clinging to the past. “Nick has this speech about how things can’t be different if you lose the capacity to imagine them differently,” she says. “I see the play as a love letter to the human imagination: you’ve got to be able to imagine another world first …”Mangan takes up the idea: “Then you might be able to achieve the impossible.” In Unicorn, that translates into not just sexual and emotional idealism but also the environmental sort. Surprisingly, perhaps, for so lively and funny a piece of writing, the prospect of global catastrophe will be strongly felt on stage – as it was in Bartlett’s 2010 playEarthquakes in London, which addressed the climate emergency in a narrative stretching from 1968 to 2525.But back to the domestic. What has Mangan done to keep things fresh in middle age? “What, inmymarriage?” he says, looking horrified. Then he ducks the question. “We’re lucky as actors because you start again every time you begin a new job. It’s like the first day of school when you walk into rehearsals: you’re back to that nervous, frightened feeling, wondering if you can do it. You’re always taking that exhilarating leap into the dark.”View image in fullscreen‘Massive idea-bombs’ … Mike Bartlett.Photograph: Marc BrennerSo he doesn’t need to seek adventure, like Polly and Nick do, because he finds it at work? “No, I just know it’s a luxury for your job to involve exploring relationships and risk-taking and how to not let yourself atrophy. Then you can go away privately and think about what you might do differently in your life.”His character proposes a “truth buffet” but it sounds as if the cast are pigging out on a whole banquet of Bartlett’s ideas. “There are days when we’ve spent hours picking away at one scene, bringing our own experiences to the conversation,” says Doherty, practically licking her lips. “That’s the nature of brilliant writing: it can be pulled apart and still maintain its genius and integrity. This play is indestructible! You could set it alight, rip it up. You can keep trying to find all the answers but, wonderfully, you’ll never get them because it’s never one thing. It keeps shifting.”Walker cites one of Polly’s misty-eyed speeches, in which she appears to be trundling complacently down memory lane before a hairpin bend brings us up sharp. From big-age-gap relationships in movies to the lot of the straight male in modern society, Bartlett’s speciality, says Walker, is “throwing these massive idea-bombs into the audience”.In 2022, Doherty starred in theNational Theatre’s rain-soaked production of Arthur Miller’s The Crucible, her performance “staunch and febrile” according to Variety magazine. Can she see Unicorn’s truth buffets and idea-bombs enduring in the way that Miller’s have? “Yeah! This play is gonna get done and done and done. People will bring so many different angles, ‘What if we do it this way, or flip it that way?’”Then she stops abruptly, palms flat on the table. “Genuinely, this thought just came into my mind,” she says, glancing at her co-stars. “Wouldn’t it be amazing to seeother peopledo it?”“Ooh,” Walker gasps. “I like that.”“I’d love to see three other actors do this play,” Doherty continues.A pause.“I mean – not, like,thisweek,” says Walker.“Or even this decade,” Mangan adds.“No,” Doherty reassures them. “But one day.”Unicorn is at the Garrick theatre, London, 4 February to 26 AprilExplore more on these topicsStageMike BartlettStephen ManganNicola WalkerinterviewsShareReuse this content"

They said: “There’s a chanceJim Carreywill wipe you off the screen.” I said: “Maybe – but not if I workwithhim.” And that’s what I did. I remember thinking: “It’s either going to be such a bad career move I’ll never work again, or it just might be funny.”One day Jim came into rehearsals having put a bowl on his head and cut his hair, because that’s how his character Lloyd would do it. I thought: “I gotta come up with something.” We were staying at a Holiday Inn and I started using the shampoo but with no conditioner. Then I’d towel my hair dry and not comb it. And that was it. I came in and said: “Maybe this is Harry’s look?” Everyone agreed. After a couple of months, you could almost break my hair off.John Hughes said we could never use his name to sell it. If we did, it was a million-dollar fineThe first morning of shooting had me and Jim up against each other on a little scooter going down mountains. We had helmets on but I had no idea whether Jim could even drive a scooter – and then he started weaving!The scene where I got my tongue stuck to the icy chairlift was bumpy, too. It’s one of the few times where you can see me break into laughter because I just knew it was funny.I was stretching myself comedically. I remember getting ready to shoot the toilet scene, after my character unknowingly drinks laxative-laden tea. Jim asked me: “Hey man, you OK?” I said: “Just cold feet. This is either the beginning of my career or the end of it.” He said: “You’ve gotta go all in man. Go all the way!” He couldn’t have been a better cheerleader. Me on that toilet will be the image on my tombstone.I have a theatre company in Michigan so I put on a preview. I was sat next to my parents and when we got to the toilet scene, my father hung his head in his hands and said: “No, Jeffrey …” Meanwhile 5,000 people fell out of their chairs laughing. The reviews were horrible though. I still have a scrapbook of 200 newspapers panning the movie and wishing it never existed. Then we were the box office No 1 for six straight weeks. That’s when it hit me that we’d done the impossible.Peter and Bobby Farrelly, directorsThe idea came from John Hughes. He was planning a movie called Ski Nuts about two dumb guys in Aspen. That’s all he had. Our agent asked if we wanted to work with him. We pitched the first act of Dumb and Dumber and he literally fell off his chair laughing. “This is it,” he said. “And you’re directing it.”We wrote the script in three weeks but the studio didn’t get back to us. Then John left Universal so the project just sat there for a couple of years until I wrote to John asking if he could ask Universal to give us the rights back. He did but said we could never use his name when selling it. If we did, it was a million-dollar fine. When promoting the movie, we wanted to say it was John Hughes’s idea but we didn’t have a million dollars. Now, though, we finally thought we’d tell. We think he’d be happy for people to know the truth.View image in fullscreen‘Jim pushed to make them even dumber’ … Peter, top, and Bobby Farrelly in 1998.Photograph: Bob Riha Jr/Getty ImagesThe movie wouldn’t have got made without Jim Carrey. Everybody in town shot it down. Then someone called and said: “Jim Carrey wants to do it.” His career was just taking off. He’d made Ace Ventura and The Mask but neither had been released. Ace Ventura was a surprise hit, and to have him attached to our low-budget movie catapulted us into a higher stratosphere.We knew Jeff Daniels had a comedic sensibility but the studio didn’t see it. Jim read with him and said: “That guy scared the shit out of me. I was on my heels the whole time. That’s got to be the guy.” We said: “Great. Tell the studio.” Jim called and said he wanted Jeff.Jim relished the fact that these characters were incorrigibly dumb and pushed to make them even dumber. We showed up at his house before shooting and he had that haircut and his tooth was chipped. We were hysterical. He said it was the haircut he had when he was a kid. He had chipped his tooth as a kid, too. He had been to the dentist and had them chip the tooth cap.In the final scene, a bus-full of girls on a national bikini tour offer Harry and Lloyd jobs as oil boys. The studio absolutely wanted them to get on the bus, but Jeff and Jim both said: “We’re not getting on that bus. Lloyd and Harry are too dumb. These guys are dumb and they remain dumb.” We agreed. It was a risky move. The studio was upset – but the audience loved it.Explore more on these topicsComedy filmsHow we madeJim CarreyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

This year, you didn’t really need in-depth knowledge of the music industry or the Recording Academy’s internal machinations to work out what was going to happen, unless there was a major upset.1:51Grammy awards 2025: Beyoncé and Kendrick Lamar lead winners in aftermath of LA fires – videoAcross the previous 12 months, a succession of artists impacted in a way that pop music is no longer supposed to do. Its once-central defining role within broader popular culture is held to have been vastly diminished by social media, and yet Kendrick Lamar’s Not Like Us wasn’t just a huge commercial success, it influenced everything, from US sports to the campaign messaging of the American presidential election to sales of the fashion brands featured in its video: if you were going to dub anything the song of the year, it was obviously going to be that. Likewise, Charli xcx’sBrat, an album which caught a mood so completely, its title wound up a widely used (if nebulously defined) adjective: the notion of it ending the night unrewarded seemed fairly unthinkable (though it didn’t triumph in its biggest nominated categories).View image in fullscreenKendrick Lamar with his Grammys haul, including record of the year for Not Like Us.Photograph: Frederic J Brown/AFP/Getty ImagesGrammys 2025: the winners, the losers, the performances – as it happenedRead moreMoreover, Brat was part of a noticeable shift in the tone of mainstream pop music, away from impeccably styled, media-trained, Instagram-filtered perfection towards something messier, more heartfelt and personal, a state of affairs it would have been faintly nuts for the Academy not to recognise. This wasn’t merely the kind of trend that provokes think pieces from critics and ups the general quality of pop music – it was one that also sold millions of records by Sabrina Carpenter andChappell Roan, both of whom deservedly did well on the night. Should anyone doubt that a new mood in pop is abroad, it’s worth noting that Roan turned up to the ceremony wearing a wimple and drag-queen makeup and spent her acceptance speech excoriating the music industry for its unwillingness to provide young artists with a living wage in an era of record profits. You probably wouldn’t have expected that from the best new artist winner a few years back, but it’s exactly the kind of thing that Chappell Roan does: she’s both impressively outspoken and possessed of a very original take on how a pop star should look.View image in fullscreenOutspoken and original … Chappell Roan accepts her award for best new artist.Photograph: CBS Photo Archive/CBS/Getty ImagesElsewhere, you could certainly argue the Beyoncé albums that failed to snare the album of the year category in previous years were qualitatively better than the album that finally won it – certainly, 2016’s Lemonade and 2022’s Renaissance were more consistent and conceptually more coherent – but you’d be harder pushed to make a case thatCowboy Carterwasn’t impactful enough. For all it seemed to tire of its Beyoncé-goes-country theme midway through, throwing in everything from hip-hop to psychedelic soul, Cowboy Carter felt of the moment. It featured Shaboozey – ahead of his single A Bar Song (Tipsy) spending a record-setting 19 weeks at the top of the US chart – and it was part of the ongoing vogue for pop artists shifting their sound towards something more country-adjacent, unencumbered by the kind of this-isn’t-country dismissal from Nashville that famously dogged Lil Nas X’s similarly successful Old Town Road five years ago.Indeed, the closest the Grammys came to controversy – aside from awards for Chris Brown and Dave Chappelle, and a provocative appearance by Kanye West and his wife – was when it seemed most traditional, handing out the best rock performance gong to the Beatles forNow and Then. You could view that as merely an act of sentiment – Now and Then was, after all, dubbed “the last Beatles single”, a final leave-taking from the biggest band of all time – but there’s no getting around the fact that it was a rock performance that required AI to make it happen, previous attempts at extracting a usable vocal from John Lennon’s unfinished 1977 demo having failed because the equipment wasn’t up to it. The rights and wrongs of using AI in music have been hotly debated and one way you could read Now and Then’s success is as a tacit thumbs-up from the music business for a deeply divisive technology, or at least a hopeful suggestion that it might be a wonderful tool rather than a catastrophe for creativity. You have to admire their optimism.Explore more on these topicsGrammy awards 2025Kendrick LamarCharli xcxAwards and prizesChappell RoanThe BeatlesBeyoncécommentShareReuse this content"

While sea shells, corals and translucent green water are far from her only subjects, she did paint them with a ravishing, hypnotising sensuality.In her 1938 painting Scylla, two rocky pinnacles rise from a translucent green-blue sea – except these geological formations are not stone, they are flesh. Knobbly pink sausages intertwine to form towering pillars. Their summits are rounded like the ends of two erect penises – that’s the artistic intention, not my dirty daydreaming. Colquhoun, as she said, is in the bath beholding her own thighs. Between them sprouts a red coral for pubic hair. A sharp-prowed boat is heading towards the opening.There are two reasons Colquhoun is such a delight. We’ll save the wildest until last. First, let’s recognise a simple technical fact: she’s a wondrous colourist. It’s the pale yet sharp colouring of Scylla that makes it so hallucinatory, a surrealist masterpiece that perfectly enacts this art movement’s belief in the liberating power of the unconscious.View image in fullscreenThighs or penises? … Ithell Colquhoun’s Scylla, 1938.Photograph: Joe Humphrys/Spire Healthcare/Noise Abatement Society/SamaritansBorn in 1906 into the imperial elite in India, Colquhoun went to Cheltenham Ladies’ College then got a solid, old-fashioned training as a figurative painter at the Slade, with teachers including the artistically conservativeHenry Tonks. Yet even in her early works, she has a feel for chromatic fun. In her 1935 portrait Humfrey Gilbert Garth Payne, a man in a sapphire blue shirt is framed against a room full of amber and ivory light.When she embraced surrealism, that chromophilia became ecstatic. In her 1946 painting Alcove, a subterranean chamber opens up in glowing intense colours that destabilise your optic nerve: red like the body’s inner softness, a fiery orange, a colour that’s yellow and pink, while a blue worm rises from the flame. It is vaginal, that’s obvious, yet also unearthly, like the tent of a divinity.She adopted the surrealists’ use of “automatism” to bypass rational thought and tap into the Freudian unconscious. Her preferred technique wasDecalcomania, in which you blot wet colours by folding and squeezing the paper. What she saw in stains will open your mind. Colquhoun is some kind of genius. Her mind ignites itself in scintillating starbursts of mystery. In St Elmo, a flowery organic mound gives birth to a fleshy entangled tower of pink tubes against a foamy sky or sea of molten blue: you can see clearly how it began as a Decalcomanic blot of random colours and textures. Out of this lovely chaos Colquhoun has pictured a form like the architecture of the innermost body.In fact, there are unlikely photos of her from an early BBC television broadcast in 1948, giving a demonstration of how to do your own automatic art. Why is it so unlikely she broadcast from Ally Pally on the Reithian BBC? Because the other reason for Colquhoun’s distinctive energy was her fascination with magic.View image in fullscreenIthell Colquhoun by Man Ray, 1932.Photograph: Man Ray Trust/ADAGP Paris/Centre PompidouIt is there in her 1932 painting Aaron Meeting Moses, in which horns and a red curvy magic wand suggest the occult rather than the Old Testament. It pervades her imaginings right through to the abstract, druggy-hued tarot deck she created in 1977.Colquhoun’s belief in the occult was, apparently, dead serious. It got her thrown out of the official British surrealist group, because her membership of the magical Order of the Golden Dawn seemed dodgy to them after Britain went to war with Germany. The surrealists had a point: the Golden Dawn had an interest in eugenics and the use of “sex magick” to develop spiritually superior beings.I may be occult-phobic but every bit of mystical tosh is treated here with too much respect. The Tate has even published Sex Magic, a compendium of her occult designs, as “a radical contribution to our understanding of magic, art, sexual enlightenment and female desire”. There’s too much reverence also to her book The Living Stones, which told 1950s readers about the druidic magic of Cornwall’s stone circles – long after any connection between such Neolithic monuments and the druids was disproved.View image in fullscreenIthell Colquhoun, Gorgon, 1946.Photograph: Spire Healthcare/ Noise Abatement Society/SamaritansI’m with the surrealists; all for desire and the unconscious, not so sure about the ritualistic paganism. By far the weakest room in the exhibition is dedicated to Colquhoun’s cosmological drawings. Her depiction of Sex Magic is fun, though.You don’t need to take an artist’s ideas literally, let alone share them, to be inspired by the art. It is not necessary to take William Blake’s personal mythology of Urizen or Los as gospel to appreciate him as a visionary artist. And at times Colquhoun is Blakean – not to mention Shakespearean.In her 1939 painting Gouffres Amers, a fallen figure lies on a rocky shore and yet at the same time seems to be underwater. He could be a crashed pilot, given the date. He is conscious as he decays. Coral sprouts from his chest, seaweed from his groin, as his skeletal form evolves into some new life, perverse and sex-magickal. Those are pearls that were his thighs.Ithell Colquhoun: Between Worldsis at Tate St Ives until 5 MayExplore more on these topicsArt and designArtTate St IvesPaintingreviewsShareReuse this content"

I’m bad in a good movie’: Guy Pearce downplays his performances as Oscars loomStuart HeritageHe’s been nominated for an Academy Award for The Brutalist, but all Guy Pearce is concerned with is how bad he was in Memento … oh, and in NeighboursMon 3 Feb 2025 11.41 ESTLast modified on Mon 3 Feb 2025 13.38 ESTShareThe Oscars are just one month away and nobody knows anything for sure, apart from the fact that Kieran Culkin is definitely going to win the best supporting actor category. This is all but written in stone at this point. Culkin has won most of the otherawards, and he’s a hit on the internet, and so the Oscars themselves are merely a formality.Which is fine, except that four other people have been nominated forbest supporting actor, and they’re faced with spending the next few weeks grinding through a thankless promotional campaign that they know will be fruitless. How does one even begin to do that? In the case of Guy Pearce, who is nominated forThe Brutalist, you spend your time telling everyone how rubbish you are.Memento at 20: Christopher Nolan’s memory thriller is hard to forgetRead more“I watched Memento the other day and I’m still depressed,” Pearce toldthe Timesthis weekend. “I’m shit in that movie. I’d never thought that before, but I did this Q&A of Memento earlier this month and decided to actually watch the film again. But while it was playing, I realised I hate what I did … I watched Memento and realised I’m bad in a good movie. Fuck!” Pearce then went on to say: “If I reckon my performance in Neighbours is two out of ten, Memento is a five.”The topic came up because, since Memento was made, Christopher Nolan has made a point of casting and recasting the same actors again and again. Take his new movie based onThe Odyssey, for instance. So far the names attached include Anne Hathaway (previously in The Dark Knight Rises and Interstellar), Matt Damon (Interstellar and Oppenheimer), Robert Pattinson (Tenet), Elliott Page (Inception), Benny Safdie (Oppenheimer), Himesh Patel (Tenet) and Bill Irwin (Interstellar). They do not, however, include Guy Pearce. For that matter, his name hasn’t come up in any film Nolan has made since the year 2000.And this clearly stings, not least because the “I’m bad in Memento” line isn’t even Pearce’s first try at rationalising this abandonment. In December, he claimed that he hasn’t worked with Nolan again because of a spiteful studio suit. “There was an executive at Warner Bros who quite openly said to my agent, ‘I don’t get Guy Pearce. I’m never going to get Guy Pearce. I’m never going to employ Guy Pearce,’” he toldVanity Fair. “So, in a way, that’s good to know. I mean, fair enough: there are some actors I don’t get. But it meant I could never work with Chris.”The Brutalist trailer – videoReally, it’s unfair that Guy Pearce has to try to explain this at all. Even though it has become a topic of interest online, it isn’t as if he’s the only actor to have only starred in oneChristopher Nolanfilm. Harry Styles hasn’t appeared in a Christopher Nolan film since Dunkirk, for instance, and after Oppenheimer he hasn’t cast Robert Downey Jr in The Odyssey. And then there’s Insomnia to think about. Nolan has made 10 films since then. That’s 10 chances to rehire Al Pacino, arguably the greatest screen actor of our age, and he hasn’t done it a single time. So Guy Pearce might be a Nolan soloist, but so is Pacino. It isn’t exactly a bad group to be in.Besides, it’s worth pointing out thatGuy Pearceisn’t actually bad in Memento at all. That film is such a temporal headache that it needed Pearce’s performance, as groggy and vague as it was, to sell it. It has become trite to say that Nolan’s films are chilly and unemotional, and yet Pearce packed as much humanity into his role as he possibly could. It might have even been the thing that stopped Memento from becoming as impenetrable as Tenet.Plus, even though he isn’t actually going to win the award, Pearce is now an Oscar-nominated actor. Thanks to his work inThe Brutalist, his stock has never been higher. Indeed, he now operates at a level where Christopher Nolan might actually notice him again. Both Nolan and Pearce are artists with long futures ahead of them, so it makes sense that their paths will cross again. That is, unless Christopher Nolan starts hiring Kieran Culkin in his place.Explore more on these topicsFilmGuy PearceOscarsChristopher NolanThe BrutalistAwards and prizescommentShareReuse this content"

Walking on to the set for Tom and Shiv’s wedding, which was filmed at Eastnor Castle near Gloucester, felt immense. I thought my character Doddy was a sweet kid, kind of lost and making his way in catering. I’d done some waitering myself, serving canapes at posh events. For health and safety reasons, we weren’t supposed to eat leftover food, so I used to eat out of the bins. That’s something Doddy would do. I once walked into a mirror and dropped a tray of champagne flutes, too, so Doddy felt familiar.View image in fullscreen‘Friends texted “Are you OK?”’ … Tom Morley and Jeremy Strong as the waiter and Kendall Roy.Photograph: HBOWhen I spilled wine on Logan Roy, there was no acting required. I was genuinely scared to be working with Brian Cox. He was lovely but as soon as we started filming, he transformed into this tyrant. It shook me but it was exhilarating. Logan called Doddy a jerk, a prick and told him to fuck off. Nowadays people ask Brian to tell them to fuck off. I was an early adopter!The sequence in the car withKendall, played by Jeremy Strong, was a night shoot, which made it more thrilling. Jeremy had only just learned to drive manual, so it was lucky we didn’t end up in the lake for real. When you snort ketamine on TV, you use glucose powder, which has a slight kick. After that scene, they go on this doomed errand to find cocaine and swerve to avoid a deer. There was an animal trainer on-set, walking around with a deer on a lead at 2am, which was a first for me.View image in fullscreen‘I was an early adopter’ … Brian Cox as Logan Roy berates the waiter.Photograph: HBOI’d had diving lessons in a tank but, unfortunately, when they propelled the car into the lake, it flipped on its back. My diving skills weren’t up to escaping an upside down car, so a stuntman did the underwater shots instead. When the episode aired, the most common texts from friends were “Are you OK?’ and “This is why you don’t do drugs”. It was only 20 minutes of screen time but the storyline had staying power. Doddy’s death haunted Kendall. It even came up in the finale, so the ripples lasted four seasons. When I watch it, I still find myself willing Kendall to rescue me.‘Some takes were too gruesome for BBC compliance’Maya SondhiplayedLine of DutystalwartPCManeet Bindra, who had her throat cut by members of an organised crime group in season fiveKilling off Maneet was all my fault. We were at a boozy lunch before making series five. I’d had some wine and said: “What are you going to do with Maneet? Why not kill her? It’d be really shocking.” Jed Mercurio, theLine of Dutycreator, said: “Nah, you don’t really want to die.”View image in fullscreenMaya Sondhi as PC Maneet Bindra.Photograph: BBC/ World ProductionsBut he must’ve thought about it because a few weeks later, he rang and said: “I could give you some great scenes, kill you off, then we can chat about your own writing.” I was thrilled. Jed’s company produced my police procedural, DI Ray – and I got to go out of Line of Duty with a bang!It was a blast to film. There aren’t many Asian stuntwomen around, so I always do my own stunts. Fantastic fun, if not great for insurance purposes. We had special effects guys who’d worked on Game of Thrones. They built a jetty for the throat-slashing, then two guys laid down underneath it, pumping fake blood.I got a special neck cast done, then make-up created a slit throat. It looked so realistic. I took a selfie sitting on the toilet with this slit throat. There were gruesome full-frontal takes we couldn’t use because of BBC compliance. The two actors who killed me were so sweet. I told them: “If this was real life, I could take you both.”View image in fullscreen‘It was a blast to film’ … Maya Sondhi as PC Maneet Bindra in Line Of Duty.Photograph: BBC/ World ProductionsMy violent death was powerful because Maneet was such a gentle character. When it aired, 8m people watched me die. My mum was a bit traumatised. Fans tweeted me, going:“You’re not really dead, are you? You can’t be!” They didn’t quite believe it because the show was known for twists and turns. But I got two series of DI Ray out of it, which more than compensated. The scene featured on Gogglebox. “I can die happy now,” I thought. “And so can poor Maneet.”Maya Sondhi is the creator and writer of DI Ray, which is available on ITVX‘Viewers thought Adriana’s soul was going up to heaven’Dreade Matteoplayed mob wifeAdriana La Cerva, who gotkilled in the woods in season five of The SopranosI found out Adriana was going to get whacked while sitting on a kerb with Sopranos showrunner David Chase. I was wearing a neck brace because I’d just filmed a car crash scene with James Gandolfini, who played Tony Soprano. David sat me down and said: “I’m going to shoot it two ways: one where you die, one where you get away. Nobody will know until it airs.” The Sopranos was such a boys’ club. Guys would get called into the office for meetings. I was pulled aside on the street.View image in fullscreen‘He was upset that he had to pull me out of the car by my hair’ … Drea de Matteo as Adriana La Cerva in The Sopranos.Photograph: HBOPeople think filming the scene must have been hellish but it wasn’t. Because I had so little dialogue, it was a relief. I just had to sit in the car and cry. I know how to do that. Adriana is killed by Silvio, played by Steven Van Zandt, and I was more concerned about making Steven feel comfortable. He was upset that he had to pull me out of the car by my hair but I told him not to worry. He also objected to calling me a cunt but I was like: “It’s OK! I’ll call you a cunt first. Let’s fucking go!”David insisted on not showing the moment of death. He told me he loved Adriana and didn’t want to see her actually get killed. So she crawls across the forest floor to get away, then you hear gunshots as the camera pans up. Some fans interpreted that as her soul going up to heaven. Stevie went on Jay Leno’s show and he asked: “Is she really dead?” Stevie said: “What the fuck do you think I was doing out there? Shooting squirrels?” That was confirmation for anyone clinging to the hope that she’d survived. My parents couldn’t watch it. Fans freaked out. I got messages saying: “I just cancelled HBO in protest.”I won an Emmy for the role. I used to hide it away in the bathroom but during the pandemic, I put it on the mantelpiece to celebrate my past. We were the godfathers. We redefined what TV could do. Twenty years later, people are still being moved by Adriana’s death.Dreade Matteo is the co-founder of clothing brandUltrafree‘My deep-fried death got a record number of complaints’Lisa Faulkner played MI5 agent Helen Flynn, who had her head shoved into a deep fat fryer by a far-right leader in SpooksI auditioned for Zoe, the role that ultimately went to Keeley Hawes. I’d done loads of research into MI5, read Stella Rimington’s book and was super-excited about playing a spy. Before I’d even left the building, my agent rang and said: “They say you’re not right for Zoe but there’s another character they’d love you to play. She’s in it for two episodes. They’re going to sell her as a cast regular – then she dies.” I was happy. I’d rather have that plotline than be sitting at a desk for the whole series.The deep-fat fryer was actually full of water but they put a layer of oil on top for the right consistency, then used dry ice for smoke. When I put my head in it, it had this horrible oily texture. I couldn’t wait to wash my hair afterwards. Kevin McNally played the terrorist who tortured me. I’d worked with his wife, Phyllis Logan, on Holby City. She was lovely, so it was nice to be killed by her husband. I got the impression Kevin enjoyed it. We all did. It’s fun doing action scenes, rather than walking and talking.View image in fullscreen‘It got 250 complaints. I took it as a compliment’ … Shane Attwooll and Lisa Faulkner in Spooks.Photograph: John Rogers/BBCThere were three stages to my demise: first, they put my hand in the burning hot oil, next they shoved my face into it and then shot me in the head. What a way to go. I got a great funeral, too. Loads of spies looking sombre, then it was whispered into the ear of the boss Harry that Kevin’s character had been assassinated as retribution. Very Godfather-esque. Obviously I wasn’t there but it was good to see. Apparently JJ Abrams showed my death to his writers’ room and said: “This is how you do it!” I’d love him to think: “Wonder what she’s doing now? Let’s cast her in something!”Viewers were so shocked, it got 250 complaints – the most for anything that year. I took it as a compliment. Years later, my daughter came across it and said it was awful. I thought, “God, you can find anything online, can’t you?”My death raised the stakes for Spooks. Viewers never knew who might die next. Killing off your stars became a thing that dramas did. Now I’m a TV chef, I often use deep-fat fryers. It clearly didn’t put me off.‘Playing a corpse is one of the hardest things I ever did’Kristine Sutherland played Buffy’s mother Joyce Summers, who died of a brain aneurysm in The Body, a landmark episode of Buffy the Vampire SlayerAt the end of season three, I told Joss Whedon, the showrunner, I was moving abroad. He said: “Are you coming back?” When I told him it was only for a year, he said: “Good, because I need to kill you.” That was a surprise. It worked well because Buffy went off to college and didn’t need her mom for a while, then I returned for two more seasons, waiting to die. When the script finally arrived, it resonated strongly because my own mother had a brain aneurysm at around the same age.View image in fullscreen‘At times, tears flowed down my face’ … Kristine Sutherland played Buffy the Vampire Slayer’s mother Joyce Summers.Photograph: PRPlaying a corpse for an entire episode is one of the hardest things I ever did. When Buffy finds me on the couch and says “Mom?” it broke my heart, but I couldn’t show it. I had to lie as still as possible in this awkward position. I wore contact lenses to make my eyes milky. They used CGI to airbrush out the pulse in my carotid artery. It was emotional lying there. At times, tears flowed down my face – grief for my own parents, for Buffy, for everybody who had lost a family member.The hardest part was the fight scene that happened after I was taken to the morgue. A vampire sits up and attacks Buffy. It was a long sequence and I was never sure when the cameras were on me. I just took a deep breath and held it, while all this chaos happened around me. That mortuary slab was like ice. Thank goodness they put a pad under me so I didn’t get cold.Amid all the supernatural action, my death felt real. Nobody took a stake and went: “Oof!” It was when mortality hit home. I lost my dad young, so could relate to these kids having to comprehend death for the first time. At every fan convention, people tell me how it touched or helped them. It opened conversations and still does.‘At one point, my whole body started to shake’Cyril Nri played Lance Sullivan, who was killed with a golf club in a homophobic attack inRussell T Davies’s CucumberI’m often wary of playing the black guy who dies, but Cucumber was totally different. It wasn’t only a gift of a part – it told a truth about some liaisons in gay society. When meeting up with strangers, especially in the wee small hours behind closed doors, you’ve got to be careful.All the warning signs were there. Everything about this guy screamed: “Stay the fuck away!” Yet it’s telling how desperate people are for love, especially if you’ve hidden in your life. You forgive and overlook red flags until the point you’re in trouble. When I researched how many deaths happen in and around Canal Street [Manchester’s “gay village”], it was sobering. People seek intimacy but settle for lust.View image in fullscreen‘It was sobering’ … Vincent Franklin as Henry and Cyril Nri as Lance in Cucumber.Photograph: Ben Blackall/PR ImageYou see little of the killer blow. It’s mainly in the face. It was a golf club because it’s the sort of weapon likely to be in that guy’s room. It’s horrific to linger on someone’s face during their last moments. First, it’s shock and indignation, then sadness and regret. It’s not cartoonish violence. There’s a visceral realness to it.It’s a long scene and filming took for ever. I had to remain still in the wound makeup with blood being pumped out. It was difficult to remain emotionally in the right place for four hours in closeup. At one point, my whole body started to shake. Lance’s life had been soundtracked by Eurythmics and Annie Lennox, so I had those songs in my head as I sat there. When you see a tear roll down my face, it’s Lance crying, not me. I still have a Lance playlist on my phone.When the episode aired, I was in a play in Norwich. I went back to my dressing room and my phone was full. I’m not on social media but a friend had screenshot pages and pages of reactions to Lance’s episode, saying: “You’re trending!” I sat there, half out of costume, reading all these lovely messages.Owen Jones wrote about it in the Guardian. After 30 years in the profession, I got a Bafta nomination. To play a gay part and get that huge reaction was fantastic. Just two days ago, a young man approached me and told me it changed his life.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionSuccessionLine of DutyThe SopranosSpooksBuffy the Vampire SlayerUS televisionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Photograph: Julien Faure/Paris Match/Contour by Getty ImagesHer gruesome horror The Substance has won her multiple Oscar nominations – and given its star Demi Moore’s career new life. But did taking down the patriarchy have to be so gory?ByZoe WilliamsMon 3 Feb 2025 04.54 ESTFirst published on Mon 3 Feb 2025 00.00 ESTShareCoralie Fargeat is based in Paris, but is in London for the Oscar nominations – the film she wrote and directed,The Substance, has been nominated for best picture, best director, best original screenplay, best actress (for Demi Moore) and best makeup (the prosthetics are really something). It’s the same story with the Baftas (minus best film), and Moore, of course, has already won the Golden Globe for her role. She accepted it with the memorable line, “Thirty years ago, I had a producer tell me that I was a ‘popcorn actress’ …”Fargeat is all smiles in the office of her production company in central London. There’s a big plate of salami – she loves salami (I love salami!). I suppose I expected her to be more austere, but that’s the patriarchy for you: you can’t even make feminist body-horror without people expecting you to frown. That’s what society does. “It puts labels on things, and puts people into boxes,” Fargeat says. “If you are this, you can’t be that. Pretty girls should always smile. If you’re pretty, you can’t be gross. If you’re blond, you are stupid. We make fun of these things but they create representations that destroy us.”Fargeat is the only female director nominated at this year’s Oscars, and if not the only feminist then certainly themostfeminist, but what surprises me more is that anything so bloodthirsty would get on to the list. That’s just not what the Oscars do, is it? “Exorcist?” the publicist demurs, but hell, that film is as old as I am (it was released in 1973).View image in fullscreenDemi Moore in The Substance (2024).Photograph: Christine Tamalet/MubiNow 48, Fargeat made her first full-length feature, Revenge, in 2017. It was so graphic that paramedics had to be called to the premiere, where a guy had a seizure. “He’s fine!” the directorsaid in an interviewat the time. The film is a rape-revenge fantasy, told through the body (Matilda Lutz’s) and in the way its stance changes – but also with some very detailed injuries. “I like to create a visceral visual experience. I like to take things to excess, mix violence and fun elements. I fully went for it – embraced my singularity as a strength not a flaw. I started to take the first step, with Revenge, and I felt this is the place where I belong. Where I can express myself with so much confidence, where I feel powerful, where I feel free, where I have no doubts.”Fargeat grew up in Paris, watching Indiana Jones, escaping her creeping sense that, between her glasses and her personality, she didn’t fit in. “I didn’t feel at ease in real life. I was super shy. I felt totally not adapted to reality. When I watched films, that’s where I felt alive, that’s where I felt I had great emotions, that’s where I felt at home.” She discovered horror as a teenager, and it intersected with her sense of gender alienation. “When I grew up, girls weren’t supposed to love horror. People used to say, ‘Coralie loves guy movies.’ I felt very proud of that. I felt like I had access to a world that was not supposed to be mine.”I didn’t feel at ease in real life. I was super shy. I felt totally not adapted to reality. When I watched films, that’s where I felt aliveShe went to La Fémis cinema school in Paris and made her first film in 2003, a short called Le télégramme, which won two festival awards and was nothing like her later mayhem. It’s based on a short story by the Scottish writer Iain Crichton Smith, whose purpose was to “expose the pointlessness of petty rivalries in small, rural, island communities” (according toBBC Bitesize– it’s on the Scottish highers syllabus).That is not the logline you’d give Fargeat’s film, in which two women await news of their sons and see the operator on his way with a telegram, which they know is only sent in the event of a death. It’s a short, brutal dive into how maternal love can turn your heart to stone – each is hoping, one almost with exhilaration, that it is the other one’s son who has died. “I always wanted to do genre, non-realistic films, but I knew that if I wanted to have a chance for my first short to be financed and made, I had to find some kind of normal story,” Fargeat says. “At the same time, there was a lot of space for me to still do genre, in the way that I could create the mise-en-scene, create a world, a universe, where visuals and sounds and frame and silence build tension, build atmosphere.”View image in fullscreenThe Substance’s Oscar-nominated makeup and prosthetics.Photograph: Christine Tamalet/MubiHer next release was Reality+ in 2014, another short film, which nudged towards the territory of The Substance. In the film, people can alter their appearance with a digital device, but it only lasts a few hours. Again, it was constrained by finance: “I knew I couldn’t have a lot of prosthetics. I wish I could have been more in the body with Reality+.”A quick walkthrough, with only the scantest of spoilers, for those who haven’t seen The Substance:Demi Mooreis a screen-aerobics megastar who is unceremoniously binned by her TV network (and run over by a car) on her 50th birthday. A disembodied corporate voice offers her a Faustian deal: she can have her young self back – only better – but has to live alternate weeks in each body. The unused body exists, maimed and lifeless, in a tiled bathroom.Moore’s character Elisabeth takes the deal: enter Margaret Qualley as Sue, in a self-birthing scene that is the most gruesome thing you’ll ever see – unless, that is, you watch the whole film. Organs burst out of the zips of catsuits; a hunchback springs up like it has a mind of its own. Did Fargeat worry that she was denying herself a mainstream audience, let alone any plaudits, with the gore? “The movie is violent, it is excessive, it is unsubtle. But I never censor myself. I never think, ‘That’ll reduce my audience.’ I go, always, with sincerity.”Demi wanted to get her narrative back from the things people were projecting on to her. The script met the actress who was ready at that momentThe Substance, she says, is a film about what women “usually want to hide, or are told that you should hide. That’s why it was important for me to make it very visceral, very present, because it was a real statement: no, everything you ask us to hide, to cut, to make thinner, to erase, it will explode. Our pearly smiles are made of so many horrendous things that we have to keep within ourselves. I was trying to deconstruct, explode the idea of beauty. To show the reality of who we really are and what we’re made of.”View image in fullscreenFargeat and Moore on the set of The Substance.Photograph: Christine Tamalet/MubiSome critics have found the Moore/Qualley dyad essentially still male-gaze, just with a hyperreal, nightmarish filter. Qualley’s youth is literally bursting with perfection; Moore’s ageing is repulsive in a fascinated way, as if the spectacle of a woman losing her beauty is Jabberwocky-level horrific. Plus, they fight; if you think you’re looking at the relationship between young and old women, then it’s defined by resentment and disgust, which is quite a guy perspective.But since Elisabeth/Sue areone divided woman, the allegory instead is that beauty standards create a duality – how you look versus how you have to look, to please the world – that is inherently violent. The self resents the mask for suffocating it; the mask is disgusted by the self. “This distinction between who you really are and who you’re trying to be, that’s what creates the real violence. That’s what creates the disconnection with yourself. Everything you do to try to look some other way creates two selves; and there will always be this fear that your real self is going to find a way to be seen.”I was surprised by Demi Moore in this role. “It was not obvious to me, either,” Fargeat says. “I knew that it was going to be tough to have an actress accept that part. It puts her in a very dangerous place. I knew I would have to face many ‘no’s, and that’s what happened. The name Demi Moore came up, but we thought: she would never want to do that. I imagined her in hyper control of her image. I said, ‘Let’s approach but let’s not lose time waiting for an answer.’ But it was a time of her life, she was about to be 60, she wanted to get her narrative back for herself. She wanted to exist for herself, take it back from the things people were projecting on to her. The script met the actress who was ready at that specific moment.”View image in fullscreenMargaret Qualley in The Substance (2024).Photograph: Christine Tamalet/MubiQualley was curveball casting for a different reason. “The idea was: if I were to wake up in a body that was the perfect one, what would it be? I was raised in a time when it was the babydoll, Marilyn Monroe, Brigitte Bardot, Jessica Rabbit, being thin but curvy; having a lot of sexual attributes, too: the bum, the boobs, the waist. I wanted to transmit to the audience, waking up in that ideal, in a body that’s going to give you so much importance in the world. With Margaret, we totally created that shape. In real life, when I met her, she’s very skinny, she doesn’t have boobs, she’s almost like a tomboy. She wanted to create that girl. She trained every day to sculpt this body. We created prosthetic boobs. She really worked to create this perfect, curvy body where everything sweats sex appeal.”I remember the 80s and 90s being all about androgyny, not curves, but Fargeat reminds me what a supermodel actually looked like then – Cindy Crawford, Linda Evangelista – and describes how alien, how monstrous she felt growing up around that ideal, as a tomboy, with glasses. I guess we all measure ourselves against the most impossible standard, which is sort of the point.“Every age has its own perfect,” Fargeat says. “Now, there’s Ozempic; before, we had amphetamines. Every culture has its own standard of what is valued. But it’s always the same violence. And it’s a trap. It’s not going to solve the way you can have a fulfilling relationship with the world. To me, it’s not something you can fight on the personal level. The whole world has to change to make you at ease. I truly believe that it’s a fight you can’t win on your own.”The Substance is streaming now on MubiExplore more on these topicsThe G2 interviewThe SubstanceHorror filmsDemi MooreBeautyWomenfeaturesShareReuse this content"

She said Ruggia had repeatedly touched her inappropriately.Haenel, acclaimed for her performance in the 2019 French filmPortrait of a Lady on Fire, has said she felt guilty after the filming of The Devils and had suicidal thoughts.Ruggia had told the court he understood the s shoot had been “painful” for the actor but accused her of creating a “parallel universe” regarding the abuse. Other crew members working on the film described his behaviour towards Haenel as “invasive” and “misplaced”.After Monday’s judgment, Ruggia’s lawyer, Fanny Collin, said he would be appealing against his conviction.The court also ordered the director to pay Haenel €15,000 in damages and €20,000 for the years of psychological therapy she had to have as a result of the abuse.In 2020, Haenel stormed out of the Césars ceremony in Paris shouting “Shame!” after the director Roman Polanski – who is still sought in the US for the statutory rape of a 13-year-old girl in 1977 – was named best director for his filmAn Officer and a Spy.InMay 2023, Haenel, who won her first César in 2014 for her supporting role in Suzanne and a second for best actress for Love at First Fight the following year, announced she wasending her cinema career, accusing the industry of “widespread complicity” with sexual abusers.Several female stars of French cinema were in the courtroom to hear the verdict, including Judith Godrèche, one of the figureheads of France’s#MeToo movement, and the director Céline Sciamma, Haenel’s ex-partner and the director of Portrait of a Lady on Fire. Godrèche hugged Haenel after the verdict.In a letter published in Telerama magazine, Haenel wrote: “I decided to politicise my retirement from cinema to denounce the general complacency of the profession towards sexual aggressors and more generally the way in which this sphere collaborates with the mortal, ecocidal, racist order of the world such as it is.’ She said it was urgent to “raise the alarm”.Gérard Depardieu is to appear in court on sexual assault charges in the next major #MeToo trial inFrance. The hearing was adjourned in October until 24 March after the star’s lawyer said his client was too ill to appear. Depardieu will have a medical examination in early March to determine if he is fit to appear.The 76-year-old faces accusations from two women of sexual abuse, assault and harassment that allegedly took place during a 2021 shoot on the set of the film Les Volets Verts (The Green Shutters). The actor has denied the allegations and claims he has been targeted by “false accusations”.About 20 women have accused Depardieu of various sexual offences, including rape and sexual assault, all of which the actor has denied. In an open letter published in 2023, he said: “Never, ever have I abused a woman.”Last year, Godrèche, who has accused two high-profile directors of raping her as a teenager, urged the cinema industry to face up to sexual abuse. Godrèche told the Césars ceremony the film world had to speak out about abusive, powerful men even if it meant risking careers.“Let us not embody heroines on screen, only to find ourselves hiding in the woods in real life; let us not embody revolutionary or humanist heroes, only to wake up in the morning knowing that a director has abused a young actress and say nothing,” she said.Explore more on these topicsFrance#MeToo movementEuropeGendernewsShareReuse this content"

Robots cannot reflect the human condition for us. That is a dead end if an actor lets one AI robot manipulate his or her performance even a little bit, an inch will eventually become a mile and all integrity, purity and truth of art will be replaced by financial interests only. We can’t let that happen.”Cage added: “The job of all art in my view, film performance included, is to hold a mirror to the external and internal stories of the human condition through the very human thoughtful and emotional process of recreation. A robot can’t do that. If we let robots do that, it will lack all heart and eventually lose edge and turn to mush. There will be no human response to life as we know it. It will be life as robots tell us to know it. I say, protect yourselves from AI interfering with your authentic and honest expressions.”The actor has previously spoken out against AI, notablyin an interview with the New Yorker in July 2024, during which he said he was “terrified” of AI. Reflecting on the fact that his body had been digitally scanned for his role in the Spider-Noir TV series, Cage said: “It makes me wonder, you know, where will the truth of the artists end up? Is it going to be replaced? Is it going to be transmogrified? Where’s the heartbeat going to be? I mean, what are you going to do with my body and my face when I’m dead?”At the Saturn awards, Cage was collecting the prize for best actor in a film for his role inDream Scenario, and took the opportunity to pay tribute to the late David Lynch, who had cast him opposite Laura Dern in the 1990 film Wild at Heart. Cage said: “When I was doing Wild at Heart, I was a very serious, young actor and I said, ‘David, is it OK if I have fun on this movie?’ He said, ‘Buddy not only is it OK, it’s necessary.’”Explore more on these topicsFilmNicolas CageArtificial intelligence (AI)ComputingAwards and prizesDavid LynchScience fiction and fantasy filmsnewsShareReuse this content"

It’s strongly and fervently acted, but for me finally let down by a bizarre and almost farcical flourish of Peckinpah-esque violent horror, which undermines the accessible emotional reality of what has been happening, and which doesn’t quite do justice to the sustained effort required for a specific act of grotesque butchery.The title refers at one level to a decision to bring livestock down from the grazing hillside to the fields, but also implies a terrible, willed catastrophe. Christopher Abbott plays sheep-farmer Michael, who has perhaps inherited a temper and capacity for violence from his curmudgeonly old dad Ray (Colm Meaney); the older man once abused and terrified Michael’s late mother Peggy (Susan Lynch), a situation which created a terrible calamity indirectly shown in the movie’s prologue sequence. Nowadays, Michael’s ex-girlfriend Caroline (Nora-Jane Noone) is married to neighbouring farmer Gary (Paul Ready) and they have a son, Jack (Barry Keoghan). Gary hates Ray and Michael, partly because he suspects Caroline still has feelings for Michael, and also because they are refusing to sell him a strip of their land that he needs for a holiday-home development for which he has rashly taken out loans. So Gary steals (or “rustles”) a couple of their rams that have strayed on to his land, partly out of spite, partly to sell for much-needed cash.And so the ugly, escalating contest commences, and the film shows us another, larger territorial implication: Michael and Ray speak Irish and Gary only English – and Andrews gives us a narrative rewind to give us the effects from Gary and Jack’s points of view. Certainly, the film shows us the poisonous machismo of what’s happening and stolen rams certainly work as metaphor for toxic masculinity. Yet in plot terms there is something unsubtle, unconvincing and even absurd in where it’s all heading.Bring Them Down is in UK and Irish cinemas from 7 February.Explore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsThrillersBarry KeoghanIrelandreviewsShareReuse this content"

Prepare to say goodbye to a lot of free timeKeith StuartMon 3 Feb 2025 09.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 3 Feb 2025 12.19 ESTShareMany years ago, when Civilization II was on its way, I’d just started as a writer on the video game magazine Edge. As a fan of the original Civilization, a complex turn-based strategy sim about building vast kingdoms through thousands of years of human history, I was keen to review the sequel and my editor let me. Reader, I became completely addicted. I played the game for two weeks non-stop, leaving many pages of the magazine unwritten. This earned me a very severe written warning. In short, Sid Meier’s series almost ended my career in games writing – which is perhaps why I didn’t review the following four instalments. Now it is back, and I can no longer avoid it. I must face my seductive nemesis.In many ways, this is the game that I, and many thousands of other fans, have always known and obsessively loved: a complex, far-reaching and fascinating simulation tracking the rise of empires from ancient tribal groups to modern-day superpowers. As a player, you found towns and cities, gather resources and research new technologies, from literacy to nuclear fission, while sending out settlers, merchants and armies to expand your reach and either placate or destroy other nations. Victory can come from military might, cultural cachet or economic domination, depending on how you play and what you’re interested in. No two campaigns are ever the same.View image in fullscreenExtra nuance … Civilization VII.Photograph: 2K GamesFor this new instalment, coming almost a decade after its predecessor, Firaxis has made some radical alterations. The biggest by far is that you no longer guide a single civilisation throughout the entire campaign. Instead, you select a leader with attributes you admire – the sneaky Machiavelli, perhaps, or how about the wise Confucius – then guide that figure through a series of three distinct historical ages picking a different nation for each section. Each nation has its own unique units and buildings, adding extra nuance to your game. In my first playthrough I started the Antiquity Age with Greece because I really fancied building the Acropolis. Then I flipped to the flighty Normans for the Exploration Age, then finished as the US for the Modern Age. You don’t loseeverythingin this switching process – all your discoveries and progress points from the previous age remain, and you can opt to keep all your towns. You’re also able to select specific legacies of your past to bring forward.This gives the game a very definite structure, combatting the malaise that can often occur hours into a Civ campaign when you realise you don’t stand a chance against some brutally powerful neighbour who’s somehow developed an army five times the size of yours. If you’re struggling during one age, you just need to hold out until the next one arrives, giving you the chance to reset your objectives and relationships with nearby nations. It also ensures a technological makeover for all your units, so you can’t enter the modern era with a civilisation that can build nuclear power stations but still fights with spears and gets about the place on horseback. In a sense, it’s like your leader is on a journey through successive domains – which makes it feel more like an adventure than a straightforward sim.View image in fullscreenMore approachable … Civilization VII.Photograph: 2K GamesThere are other changes to make the game more approachable for modern players. Leaders attain attribute points based on achievements in six categories such as culture, science and combat, which can be spent on related skill trees – just like a role-playing game. There are also legacy targets that act as quests, such as building a certain number of Wonders of the World or making key scientific discoveries, moving you towards an outright victory.Beneath all this, lots of systems have been tweaked and re-thought. Maintaining diplomatic relations with other nations is a multifaceted dance involving the use of a new currency – influence – to organise shared cultural events and economic pacts, or when things go badly, many different types of subterfuge and sabotage. Throughout the years, narrative events crop up like Chance cards in a game of Monopoly, providing moments of humorous challenge. How do you react when a famous poet writes a highly critical epic about you? What do you do when a mysterious stranger demands that you copy and pass on a dusty old scroll to at least three other civilisations or face a terrible curse?Does it still resemble a sort of digitised board game? No. The landscapes may be divided into hexagonal tiles in the traditions of table-top wargaming, but they are now crammed with colour and authentic detail, from craggy mountains to swirling seas, to lively cities crowded with ornate buildings reflecting both the time period and the civilisation they belong to. Battles play out as animated tussles between intricate miniaturised troops and thundering armoured vehicles. Occasional natural disasters send floods, tornadoes and fires across the map with devastating drama.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toPushing ButtonsFree weekly newsletterKeza MacDonald's weekly look at the world of gamingEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

You get the nations that hide in a corner and quietly invent space travel before you’ve got a reliable train service, and then there are the warmongers – and I’m looking at you Gilbert du Motier – who start little fights to probe your defences then turn vicious and unrelenting, surrounding your cities and crushing isolated units. Alternatively, there’s always the cross-platform multiplayer mode if you want to pit yourself against human competitors; I wasn’t able to test this on public servers before release, but it has performed well in previews.So here we are, more than 30 years after the original game, still hungry to rule the world – and devouring every morsel of maniacal power. Some veterans may balk at the structural changes: Civilization VII is very much the Civilization for now – deep and complex, but with an emphasis on human drama and achievement rather than the sweep of faceless units across a mathematical matrix. There are still few moments in video games as pleasing as building the Hanging Gardens, or discovering a bountiful new location for a town, or marching a phalanx of troops into a battered enemy capital. This game, which once almost cost me my job, will gracefully sneak away with hours, days and possibly months of your life. But then, nobody ever conquered the world in an afternoon.Civilization VII is launched on PC (version tested), PS4/5, Switch,Xbox Oneand Xbox Series S/X, 11 FebruaryExplore more on these topicsGamesPCXbox series S/XNintendo SwitchPlayStation 4PlayStation 5Xbox OnereviewsShareReuse this content"

On release, you would have watched certain who came out on top. The Dandy Warhols had recently been catapulted to success after a Vodafone advert transformed their single Bohemian Like You from a flop into a global hit. The Brian Jonestown Massacre, meanwhile, had ended the doc in a state of disarray: drug-damaged, dropped by their label and thumping each other in the middle of a gig.Two decades on, the outcome is less clear. The Dandy Warhols’ moment in the spotlight proved fleeting, while the Brian Jonestown Massacre have a cult following big enough to warrant the publication of an acclaimedmemoirby percussionist Joel Gion and big enough that this large UK tour includes a date at Brixton Academy. Perhaps some of their audience is drawn in by the band’s myth – big on excess, volatility and danger – in which case, they’re in for a disappointment tonight. The gig’s a little shambolic – songs occasionally take a couple of goes to get started – but the only sense of danger is that someone might slowly die of old age while the band are silently retuning their guitars between songs. Long-haired, wearing Bob Dylan’s hat from the cover of Desire and directing proceedings from the side of the stage, Anton Newcombe cuts a rather inscrutable, aloof figure: if there is a visual focus, it’s Gion, tapping his tambourine.One suspects most people here have bought into the idea that Newcombe is an errant underground genius. Certainly, he’s a man with a stock in trade, as evidenced by the ease with which the set ranges across the band’s 20-album career, eliding songs from the mid-90s – Vacuum Boots, That Girl Suicide – into tracks from their most recent album, The Future Is Your Past. Regardless of their vintage, they all seem of a piece, mining a sound that, like a lot of their album titles (Who Killed Sgt Pepper?, …And This Is Our Music), is made up of reference points: the kind of riffs purveyed by the garage and psych bands on Nuggets and Pebbles compilations, the metallic jangle of the mid-60s Byrds, the blur of shoegazing and the psychedelic drone of Loop and Spacemen 3.View image in fullscreenMid-tempo monotony … the Brian Jonestown Massacre.Photograph: Peter Flude/The GuardianAs they launch into Pish or Forgotten Graves, you’re aware that Newcombe is really adept at coming up with melodies and guitar figures that sound immediately familiar, as if you know them already from a song you can’t quite place – a genuine skill – and that the music that surrounds them is a lot like old-fashioned, ungentrified indie, from an era before Britpop made alt-rock a mainstream concern. And that, one suspects, is part of the appeal. Certainly, the audience in Bexhill are largely old enough to warmly recall a time when bands that sounded at least a bit like this were the backbone of John Peel’s Festive 50: how distant it all seems in the 2020s, when a lot of what gets called “indie” sounds remarkably like the glossy 80s pop-rock you were listening to John Peel to avoid.Brian Jonestown Massacre’s Anton Newcombe: ‘People make me out to be a loser when I’m not’Read moreThere really isn’t much music around like this now, which gives the Brian Jonestown Massacre a weird USP. But unique or not, there are issues tonight. You would expect a band with four guitarists to feel overwhelming, but they somehow don’t. For all the manpower on stage, there’s a trebly thinness to the sound. Plenty of their songs devolve into drone-heavy instrumental passages, but they never quite envelop or hypnotise you. It’s not helped by the fact that almost everything they play proceeds at the same mid-tempo pace, powered by tumbling, Tomorrow Never Knows-y drums: despite the longueurs between songs, it all starts to blur into a wash, one long rummage through rock’s history books. Anemone stands out by dint of its familiarity – it’s by far their best-known song.It is, to borrow the phrase Newton uses to describe Bexhill in January, perfectly pleasant, and it’s hard not to be impressed by the Brian Jonestown Massacre’s longevity against the odds. But it’s equally hard not to think a massacre should be a little more bloody than this.The Brian Jonestown Massacre play Rock City, Nottingham, 4 Feb; then tour the UK and Ireland until 20 Feb.Explore more on these topicsMusicPop and rockIndielive music reviewsShareReuse this content"

While this low-budget thriller doesn’t have the finesse of either of those films, it does at least aim high in its sundered viewpoint on the jealousy-filled menage à trois at its centre. Debut director Munjal Yagnik plays it entirely non-linear to begin with, before settling into a more conventional but still mobile flashback structure.Mark (Gregory Waits) wakes up in disarray, quickly turning into despair when he walks into the bedroom to find (what we assume is) his partner dead on the bed. But the next scene reveals he has been playing away: his wife, Sidney (Nadine van Asbeck) returns home to find him frantically cleaning. Taking his sudden move to buy a new mattress as a sign he is still being unfaithful to her with lover Naomi (Sophie Moshofsky), she forces him to sign divorce papers. Not that his new relationship is going any better, as we next loop back to join him in the initial stages of corpse disposal immediately prior to Sidney walking through the door.Mark leans on shady construction worker pal Richie (Ryan Hope Travis) to help him drive Naomi’s body to a snowy burial ground, with this grim mission interspersed with further flashbacks to his and Naomi’s halcyon hook up. But Scarlet Winter feels more like a logistical exercise in arranging these story shards than one that uses these angles to cast illuminating light on the characters. There’s nothing particularly compelling in what’s revealed about Naomi’s growing dissatisfaction as the other woman, and Mark doesn’t seem sufficiently disturbed by believing he is her murderer.The film ratchets up the paranoia in a closing stretch that leads to a final twist – though even that is delivered ex machina for the viewers, without the protagonist himself cottoning on. Another example of how Yagnik’s film fails to locate a beating human heart underneath its frosty outer crust.Scarlet Winter is on digital platforms from 10 February.Explore more on these topicsFilmThrillersCrime filmsreviewsShareReuse this content"

The second feature from directing team Julia Gutweniger and Florian Kofler, Vista Mare foregrounds the invisible labour that goes into the business of holidays on Italy’s north Adriatic coast.The film opens in the grey months of the off-season, where the only signs of life are the rhythmic churning of a sand dredger. Soon, umbrellas are erected on the beach, while restaurants and souvenir shops start gearing up for business. Shown in static shots, these vignettes reveal the behind-the-scenes logistics not captured in glossy travel brochures.These episodic moments are so engrossing that, by the time the holidaymakers finally appear, their rowdy presence feels like an intrusion into the calm. This sense of disruption is also evoked through the film’s intriguing sound design. The blaring noises of beach aerobics or blasting DJ sets are juxtaposed with the more silent routines of manual workers, as they tend to the tasks that often go unappreciated.While the soundscape suggests a compelling mixture of boredom and productivity, the stillness of the visual compositions pleasantly recalls the deadpan absurdism of Roy Andersson’s cinema. The film’s observational approach is also far from apolitical; on the beach is where a microcosm of class and labour hierarchy unfolds. In one scene, the well-oiled machinations of the holiday season are briefly brought to a halt as a group of seasonal workers take to the streets to protest for their rights. Subtly subverting postcard-perfect ideals of cerulean waters and golden sands, Vista Mare casts its astute gaze on the troubled waters that swell beneath the bright blue sky.Vista Mare is on True Story from 7 February.Explore more on these topicsFilmDocumentary filmsItalian elections 2013ItalyEuropereviewsShareReuse this content"

On a night off from conducting Janáček’s operaJenůfaat Covent Garden – where he ismusic director designate– he put his stamp on a BBCSO programme beginning with the little-known and rewarding scherzo triste by his compatriot Pavel Haas, a composer who would be much better known had he lived longer: he was murdered in Auschwitz aged 45. Inspired by an unhappy love affair, the scherzo is angular and restless initially, its fragmentary theme coalescing into a longer melody and finally finding calm in a lyrical culmination, recalling Janáček at his most radiant.In Beethoven’s Piano Concerto No 2 the soloistJonathan Bisswas an energising presence from his first entry. The lonely lines at the end of the slow movement, played with the sustaining pedal down, sounded almost other-worldly; elsewhere, his buoyant phrases bounced off the warm-toned orchestra with transparent clarity. But in his encore, Schubert’s G-Flat Major Impromptu, the tune was so soft that it merged into the rippling accompaniment, dimming the melody’s song-like nature – if it’s possible for this piece to sound too introspective, that might be what he achieved.View image in fullscreenSoloist Jonathan Biss at the Barbican Hall.Photograph: Sarah Louise BennettThe playing Hrůša drew from the orchestra inShostakovich’s11th Symphony was on another scale entirely. Subtitled The Year 1905, the symphony memorialises a Russian Bloody Sunday – a massacre of peaceful protesters by the Tsar’s soldiers in St Petersburg – and in this performance that meant some of the loudest orchestral music the Barbican’s walls can ever have contained. Several times the orchestra hit full tilt, including a barrage of percussion with harsh xylophone on top and, in the final bars, the bells sounding the alarm. And yet in Hrůša’s performance this way wasn’t just an effect; it was the endgame of a considered, slow-burn interpretation that highlighted the mournful revolutionary songs that Shostakovich wove into the music. The flutes in the first movement and the long viola melody in the third were the most haunting, but many others were, fleetingly, just as effective – so it was not just the symphony’s juggernaut power that was striking, but its soulfulness too.Broadcast onBBC Radio 3 on 4 February,and on BBC Sounds for 30 days.Explore more on these topicsClassical musicBarbicanJakub HrůšaBBC Symphony OrchestrareviewsShareReuse this content"

He hands me a piece ofmakroudh,a honey-dipped semolina and date delicacy. It is still warm from deep frying and deliciously soft and sticky. I’m standing on an intersection between two cobbled medina streets in Tunis, capital of Tunisia, and Biles Elwadi, the sweet seller, is showing me how this national favourite is made. He rolls a sausage of the date and nut mixture into the semolina and cuts it into bite-size chunks to fry.It’s my final day in Tunisia and, as Biles packages 10 dinars’ (£2.55) worth for me to take home, I realise I don’t want to leave just yet.View image in fullscreenI’d journeyed to Tunisia flight-free, on a new rail and ferry itinerary from London devised by overland travel expertByway. Having previously travelled overland to Marrakesh in Morocco in seven days and Tirana in Albania in five, I was intrigued by the idea of getting to Tunisia in only two.It was a foggy Monday morning when I boarded the 10.31am Eurostar to Paris at London St Pancras. By 11am on Wednesday, I’m sashaying down the walkway at Tunis’s La Goulette port in sweltering heat.The visceral feeling of slow travel is so much more acute on a boatRapid trains had whizzed me through France to Marseille, with a slideshow offin de siècleParisian architecture, tree-lined fields, conifer woodlands and onwards to rocky outcrops topped by Provençal castles.When I arrive, Marseille-Saint-Charles is bathed in dreamy orange light, and my base, the boutiqueHotel Alex, is conveniently right opposite the station. That evening I wander the Vieux Port with its lively bars and restaurants, a place of migration and transit that underpins the gritty allure of this city.View image in fullscreenA cat among ceramics in Sousse.Photograph: Diana JarvisThe next afternoon I’m one of about 30 foot passengers boarding the ferry to Tunis at the shiny new port building (most drive their cars on). The visceral feeling of slow travel is so much more acute on a boat. This is no cruise ship, despite the variety of lounges, cafes and a very empty “nightclub”. I join fellow passengers for a three-course dinner in the main dining room (there’s also an à la carte restaurant and self-service cafe) and then retreat to my cabin. The gentle hum of the ship’s engine provides a suitable soundtrack to eight hours of blissful dream-filled sleep.Twenty-four hours later we arrive – and it takes just 10 minutes to get from the boat, through passport control and into a taxi. My driver speaks no English and I speak no Arabic or French, yet a combination of translation apps, gesticulation and warm smiles and I understand his excitement at having a foreigner in his cab. He tells me we’re travelling through thecentrevilletoHotel Belvederein the more chi-chi La Fayette part of town.There’s plenty to entertain you in Tunis for a few days. The world-class Bardo museum, with its collection of Roman mosaics, and Unesco world heritage Carthage ruins are widely regarded as the city’s biggest attractions, but I find watching the intoxicating variety of daily life in the medina streets more entertaining.View image in fullscreenA view from Sidi Bou Said.Photograph: bymuratdeniz/Getty ImagesAn unexpected biblical downpour turns the gullies in the cobbles into rivulets. Shopkeepers whisk their carpets and curios inside, and the heavy ornate blue doors clank shut. “Any time is coffee time,” declares the mural outside Diva Caffe, where I wait out the storm.The next day I venture out of town on a day trip to the attractive hilltop village of Sidi Bou Said, a 20-minute drive away.Here, Beignets and Bambalouni, a hole in-the-wall kitchen, is the place to try giant doughnut-like sugar-encrusted treats. I sip mint tea in Café des Nattes, overlooking the main drag. Modernist painters Paul Klee, Louis Moilliet and August Macke visited on their Tunisian odyssey. As the peachy late afternoon light brings out pink and yellow tones on the white-washed walls, I imagine them here discussing line, shape and colour.Two-hours south of the capital by road is Sousse, my next stop, famous for its sandy beaches and package holidays. But I’m more interested in what lies within the Unesco-protected ninth-century city walls. They’re best viewed from on high, and I climb the 100-plus steps to the top of the Ribat tower and a rewarding 360-degree panorama out to sea and across to the 11th-century casbah. The casbah is now home to the archaeological museum with its incredibly well preserved Roman mosaics depicting stories from both Greek and Roman myth. My base,Hotel Paris, a friendly hostel-style hotel right on top of the city walls, is perfectly located for dipping in and out of the ancient city.View image in fullscreenLooking out to the casbah, Sousse.Photograph: Diana JarvisTo the west of Sousse lies Kairouan, an hour away bylouage, a six-seater minibus. Its name loosely derives from the Arabic for “caravan”, and my two days in town are really not long enough. The city has three main claims to fame. It’s one of the most holy in Islam after Mecca, Medina and Jerusalem; it stood in for 1930s Cairo in Indiana Jones – Raiders of the Lost Ark; and it’s the carpet capital of Tunisia.Despite spending an hour or so marvelling at the impressive seventh-century mosque and its recycled Roman and Byzantine architectural features, it’s the carpet connection I spend more time exploring. You can hear the clack-clack of the looms as you wander the narrow streets. The best selection is found in the House of the Governor, built for an 18th-century Ottoman family, where there are ornate interiors, but my hour spent drinking coffee and chatting with Mohammed and Abdesatar in Tapis Okba, over the road from the mosque, is where I part with my money in exchange for a bright yellow rug.When I return to Tunis after my five-day round trip, it’s warmer and drier. I’m enjoying my new slow pace of exploring and want to stay longer – but leaving is by no means the end of my journey; there’s still the boat home.You can hear the clack-clack of the looms as you wander the narrow streetsBack on board I take an evening wander up to the deck and am buffeted by the salty Mediterranean breeze. On my way back to my cabin a beat emanating from the nightclub lures me in. A man plays a keyboard one-fingered while holding a cigarette in the other hand; another is playing something that looks like bagpipes (it’s amizwad,with a bag made of ewe’s leather, I later learn). “Have I stumbled on a wedding?” I wonder as I watch the bagpiper entreating the crowds to clap along and dance with him. No, this is just evening entertainment, Tunisian style.As the motion of the boat lulls me to sleep later that night, I know I have been utterly charmed by the Tunisians and their country.The trip was provided by Byway, which creates bespoke overland itineraries to Tunisia.

Just add soured cream and chilli oilKenji MorimotoMon 3 Feb 2025 08.00 ESTShareI’m craving easy, wholesome dishes that don’t compromise on flavour, and if time does the heavy lifting, so much the better. Enter my fennel and cabbage kraut sausage stew, a slow-cooker recipe that is truly as simple as throwing a handful of ingredients (with minimal prep) into a pot. The depth of flavour comes from the deliciously tangy ferment, and it’s delicious garnished with soured cream and your favourite chilli oil. Warm, nourishing and, best of all, it freezes well, too.Fennel and cabbage sauerkrautView image in fullscreenKenji Morimoto’s fennel and cabbage sauerkraut.To scale up this recipe (which you’ll most likely want to do, because I guarantee you’ll get through it quickly), simply follow the percentage of salt to the total weight of vegetables.Prep15 minFerment2-5 weeksMakes1-litre jar300g fennel550g white cabbage17g salt(or 2% of the total weight of the fennel and cabbage)½tbsp caraway seeds½tbsp fennel seedsThinly slice the vegetables with a knife or mandoline, then put them in a large bowl; feel free to use the core of the cabbage, too, but make sure it’s cut uniformly, so everything ferments at a similar pace.Add 17g salt to the bowl and massage the mixture for five to 10 minutes, using a fair amount of pressure to optimise the brine. If you don’t see much brine in the bottom of the bowl, continue massaging and a pool of brine should eventually appear. Sprinkle over the caraway and fennel seeds, and mix again thoroughly.Decant the kraut mix into a sterilised one-litre jar, packing it down to ensure there are no air pockets and so the brine gathers on top of the vegetables. Use a food-safe fermentation weight to ensure everything is held below the brine, then seal the jar and leave to ferment at room temperature and out of direct sunlight for two to five weeks. At the two-week mark, start tasting the sauerkraut and, once you’re pleased with its flavour and tang, move the jar to the fridge.Fennel and cabbage kraut sausage stew with soured cream and chilli oilThis stew is customisable: use plant-based sausage, change up the beans or throw in other vegetables – if you do, just remember to adjust the cooking time accordingly.Prep20 minCook3-6 hrServes4-62 tbspolive oil400g sausage, skin removed and meat crumbled2 white onions, peeled and finely diced (about 300g)Salt and black pepper2400g tins cannellini beans, drained500g fenneland cabbage sauerkraut, not drained (see recipe above)1½ litres chicken stock200g cavolo nero, leaves stripped and torn into large, bite-sized piecesTo serveSoured cream, or creme fraiche or greek yoghurtChilli oilHeat the olive oil in a pan on a medium heat, then fry the crumbled sausagemeat for five to seven minutes, until it’s cooked through and browning; use a metal spatula to scrape up any residual bits (these equal flavour!), then transfer to a bowl.In the same pan, cook the diced onion in the residual oil with a half-teaspoon of salt, stirring regularly, for five to seven minutes, until slightly caramelised.Try this recipe and many more on the new Feast app: scan or clickherefor your free trial.Put the cooked sausagemeat and caramelised onions in a slow cooker, add the cannellini beans, sauerkraut and chicken stock, and cook on low for six hours (or high for three hours).Stir in the cavolo nero until it wilts in the residual heat, then season to taste and serve with a few dollops of soured cream and your favourite chilli oil.Kenji Morimoto’s book, Ferment: Simple Ferments and Pickles, and How to Eat Them, will be published byPan Macmillan in AprilExplore more on these topicsFoodStewGerman food and drinkPickling, fermenting and preservingMain courseSausagesVegetablesrecipesShareReuse this content"

Simply chuck everything in there, turn it on and a few hours later dinner is effortlessly served. No fuss, just delicious meals.But there are a few basic slow cooker rules that you need to abide by. First, the liquid: unlike the oven or hob, a slow cooker doesn’t lose as much liquid through evaporation, so even if a dish looks as if it’s not saucy enough, trust me, it very probably is, in which case adding a load of extra stock or water will just leave you with soup, which is ideal only if you’re actually making soup. You just have to learn to trust the process.Meat with a higher fat content (think brisket, chicken thighs, pork shoulder) truly thrives with a long, slow cook, and becomes melt-in-the-mouth tender. Leaner meat, on the other hand, runs the risk of drying out, if you’re not careful, so snap up those cheaper, fattier cuts and save yourself some pennies while you’re about it.If, like me, your schedule is a bit all over the shop, you need freezer dump bags in your life. Don’t let the name put you off: prep ingredients way in advance, put them in airtight bags/containers, and freeze. Defrost overnight, then dump into the slow cooker in the morning. Easy! They’re especially good for soups, stews and sauces, and for those who don’t want to be chopping meat and veg before heading out to work.Slow cookers aren’t just for stews and soups, either. I use mine for dauphinoise potatoes, and for taco and sandwich fillings – buffalo chicken with coleslaw slapped in a brioche roll is always a winning lunch (add cream cheese to any leftovers for a moreish dip). Also, desserts – orange chocolate brioche bread-and-butterpudding, anyone? The beauty of this is that it can be mostly prepared directly in the slow cooker; for the ideal texture, grab a tea towel, pull it taut over the bowl, slap the lid on top, and the towel will absorb the steam. After one hour on high, it’s good to go.Any no-gos? Rice. Risotto and rice pudding are the exceptions to this rule, because you want them to turn starchy, but fluffy, individual grains just won’t happen in a slow cooker. Also avoid fish and seafood, because they can go mushy. Squid and octopus could potentially go into a sauce to tenderise them, but I usually steer clear.Some SOS tips: if you have overcooked a stew and it’s a bit bland, add a splash of acid (lemon juice or vinegar) to bring the flavours back to life. If it looks a bit watery? Crack open the lid towards the end of cooking and leave to cook on high so some of the excess liquid evaporates (or strain the liquid into a separate saucepan and reduce to your desired consistency). And if your cooked meat is dry or tough, somewhat counterintuitively leaving it to cook for even longer can in some cases push it past dry and into mouthwatering.The slow cooker may not be the flashiest kitchen gadget, but it’s one of the few that are a blessing all year round. So don’t even think about letting it gather dust once the weather warms up: put some puttanesca sauce on the go and get back in the garden while the slow cooker does all the work for you.

This might be coupled with the feeling of not actually beingableto cook – like not being able to run in a nightmare – and that I have lost the ability, or never had it. This existential crisis is fine for a couple of days, but I do then need to snap out of it.In these moments, I really ought to call my sister, who is completely unsympathetic to my salaried food writer anxiety, and makes me laugh. Alternatively, I can make myself a cup of tea and openMargaret Costa’s Four Seasons Cookery BookandNigella Lawson’s How to Eatat the same time, and allow myself to get lost in their charming, never lofty and always contagious communication of cooking. When I do this, it is quite often the case that I don’t make a specific recipe from either writer, but rather they provide a compassionate shove.This was exactly the case a few weeks ago, when Costa’s description of comforting casseroles – “the heady smells when the lid is taken off are consoling in themselves” – met Nigella’s description of aubergine moussaka and made me think ofPaola Bacchia’s mushroom and pepper goulash, into which I introduced pumpkin and potato. Now, after reading food writerCarolyn Bánfalvi, I have learned that the dish is actually closer to Hungary’spörköltandpaprikás, which are both names for slow-cooked, paprika-spiced stews, rather than a goulash, which is a hearty soup made with lots of paprika and onions. Thanks to all four women and various national dishes, I made the best thing I had cooked in ages.In the presence of absorbent vegetables and helped by the heat, a paste of garlic, caraway seeds and both sweet and hot paprikas converge (or, as Nigella describes it, “dovetail”) and transform the contents of the pan into a warm, mellow, aromatic whole. You want 1.2kg mushrooms (ideally a mixture of small button and chestnut mushrooms and larger field mushrooms, oyster and/or porcini), cutting the larger ones into nice, thick slices and quartering the smaller ones.The combination of mushrooms, potato,pumpkin and breadcrumbs makes this substantial enough that it doesn’t need to be served with anything else, except perhaps a bit of bread to mop up those juices. That said, it is also wonderful with buttered rice or couscous, which also makes it go even further; a blob of soured cream is also nice.Mushroom, potato, pumpkin and paprika stew, inspired by paprikasServes46 tbsp olive oil2 medium onions, peeled and sliced1 large red pepper, stalk, pith and seeds discarded, flesh sliced into strips1.2kgmixed mushrooms, ideally a mix of small button, chestnut and field, oyster and/or porcini, the larger ones cut into thick slices and smaller ones quarteredSalt and black pepper2garlic cloves1tsp caraway seeds1 tbspsweet paprika2tsp hot paprika4 small potatoes, peeled and cut into wedges400g pumpkin, peeled and cut into large chunks400g tinplum tomatoes,crushed with your handsA squirt of tomato concentrate400ml light vegetable stock or water2 bay leaves2tbsp soft white breadcrumbs1 handful chopped parsley, to finishWarm the oil in a large, heavy-based pan, then add the onions and peppers, and cook, stirring, over a moderate heat, until they start to soften. Add the mushrooms and a generous pinch each of salt and pepper, and cook, stirring, until shrunk and slightly browned.Working on a plate and using a fork or the flat of a knife, squash the garlic to a paste with the caraway seeds and a pinch of salt, then scrape into the pot and stir in both paprikas.Add the potatoes and pumpkin, stir well, then add the crushed plum tomatoes and tomato concentrate. Add the broth (or water) and bay leaves, season with salt and pepper, and bring almost to a boil. Turn down to a simmer, cover and leave to cook gently for an hour.Add the breadcrumbs, stir for a few minutes, so the sauce thickens, then finish with a handful of parsley. Serve with rice and soured cream, if you wish.Explore more on these topicsStewA kitchen in RomeFoodItalian food and drinkPotatoesVegetablesWinter food and drinkrecipesShareReuse this content"
