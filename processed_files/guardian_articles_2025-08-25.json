After the disaster, a public inquiry struggled to form a complete picture of the event, for reasons that also make it a hard subject for documentary-makers.Disaster at Sea: The Piper Alpha Story copes with the challenge superbly, leaning heavily on survivor testimony – 61 men escaped from the rig – and combining it with a simple 2D diagram of the platform’s layout to give us the fullest picture possible. It doesn’t have the special-effects budget that would be required to simulate the ferocity of the fire or the intensity of the thick, black smoke – possibly no amount of pyrotechnics or CGI would be able to do that anyway – so reconstructions of the disaster itself are kept to a minimum. Instead, the focus is on the verbal responses given by survivors to the inquiry, which have been dramatised. It’s excellent work by a cast of little-known actors, made all the more powerful by them using nothing but a chair, a table and the transcript.Context is provided by archive newsreel, and by the wives and children of the men who were aboard Piper Alpha, who talk of families reluctantly adjusting to a life where the father/husband would be absent and hard to contact for a fortnight at a time. These were ordinary working people, carried out to sea by economic forces beyond their control: the daughter of one survivor explains how her dad ended up as an employee of the billion-dollar US oil company Occidental after the Linwood car factory near Glasgow, a major Scottish employer, shut down in 1981.As Letter from America by The Proclaimers plays in the background (with its lyrics of “Linwood no more …”), we see Margaret Thatcher cosying up to flamboyant Occidental boss Armand Hammer, promising his lavish investment in Piper Alpha and other North Sea oil-production platforms and rigs would surely trickle down to benefit all. Anotherclipis a bewildering nugget from the pop culture of oil-rush Britain, taken from Shirley Bassey’s eponymous 1976 BBC TV show: Bassey stands on a North Sea rig in hard hat and overalls, surrounded by men grappling with greasy drilling equipment, belting out Everything’s Coming Up Roses.Occidental’s safety and maintenance procedures would later be gravely criticised by the inquiry, but the aftermath of the Piper Alpha calamity and the families’ fight for justice is to come in two further episodes of Disaster at Sea. For now, we are in the “iron village” of the rig itself, as horror unfolds with extraordinary power and speed. For children of the 1980s, Piper Alpha is one of a handful of notorious disasters that punctuated the decade, alongside Chornobyl, Lockerbie and the Challenger space shuttle – in its mechanics, it’s nearest to Chornobyl, as it begins with red lights blinking on a control panel, warning men who know their workplace is potentially lethal that something is slightly wrong. Before anyone has time to remedy the situation, something is terribly wrong.Those statements from the inquiry tell a bleak story of men left helplessly confused by the enveloping smoke and by the lack of guidance. They relied on Piper Alpha’s default safety protocol, which was to gather in the dining area at the top of the platform in the event of a fire: it was just beneath the helipad, from which airlifts to safety would be organised. But men towards the bottom of the structure immediately realised they couldn’t climb upwards, and those who did make it to the dining room merely found themselves trapped in a dark room that rapidly became unbearably hot and smoky, and which didn’t give them a view of the rest of the platform.The programme highlights telling, horrifying and strange details, from the men in the dining room using squashed tomatoes to cool themselves since there was no water at hand, to the film-maker riding with RAF Search and Rescue who heard a pilot’s transmission stating the fire was visible from 120 miles away. One Piper Alpha worker casually took a book with him as he evacuated, to read on the rescue vessel he assumed would save him soon; minutes later, he was in a group that disagreed about which staircase to sprint down. The men who chose the wrong staircase died.The shocking story is skilfully told by those unfussy dramatisations of the survivors’ words, as the actors leave us in no doubt about how deeply traumatised the men were by their experience. A grim and difficult task is performed with care.The first part of the three-part series Disaster at Sea: The Piper Alpha Story aired on BBC Two and the whole series is available on iPlayerExplore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewScotlandreviewsShareReuse this content"

Walking along the border path in Meriinaho, part of the Finnish border guard stationof Ilomantsi, we are closer to St Petersburg than to Helsinki. This is the most easterly point of the continental European Union.Every now and then a discreet pair of matching striped fibreglass posts pop up from the blueberry patches on either side of the frontier. One is painted blue and white to indicate Finland, the other green and red to markRussia.Despite generations of tensions and several wars, until recently these sparsely planted bollards – plus surveillance by Finnish and Russian border guards – were deemed sufficient to demarcate the neighbours. But the mood on both sides of the 830-mile (1,340km) frontier, now also a criticalNatoborder, is changing fast.Last week as he sat down at the White House with Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Donald Trump for talks on how to end the war inUkraine, Finland’s president, Alexander Stubb, drew on the border to convey to the US president Europe’s collective concern.He told Trump: “We might come from a small country but we have a long border with Russia, over 800 miles. And we of course have our own historical experience with Russia, from world war two, the winter war and the war of continuation.”In an attempt to strike a note of optimism, he added: “We found a solution in 1944 and I’m sure that we will be able to find a solution in 2025.”View image in fullscreenMatti Pitkäniitty, the commander of the North Karelia border guard district.Photograph: Jarno Artika/The GuardianBut, away from best-case scenarios discussed in meeting rooms, that solution remains elusive. And in this corner ofEuropethe threat from the Kremlin is taken increasingly seriously.After his election last year, Stubb used his first trip as president to visit the border in North Karelia and to assert that “all measures must be taken” to keep the whole country inhabited. “We cannot afford to allow eastern Finland, northern Finland or any region in Finland to wither away,” he said.Moscow’s manoeuvringSince Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Finland has rapidly changed its positioning. Itjoined Nato at record speedand later made the drastic decision to indefinitely close its entire border with Russia, accusing Moscow of directing asylum seekers to Finland in a “hybrid operation”. It is now building sections of barrier fence along 120 miles of the border, aimed chiefly at stopping irregular migration.The Finnish defence forces have said they areclosely watching Moscow’s manoeuvringamid reports that Russia has expanded its military bases near the Nato frontier. About 120 miles east of Tohmajärvi, where the Guardian was among the first to visit North Karelia’s new barrier fence, Moscow has established a new 44th army corps to be headquartered in the city of Petrozavodsk.In June, the border force arrested a man crossing illegally into North Karelia whom Finnish media have since reported was a Russian Wagner defector. The border guard has not confirmed or denied that person’s alleged connections to themercenary group. It has separately said it believes it has a person in one of its reception centres “with Wagner connections”.View image in fullscreenEmma, 19, in training with the North Karelia border guard.Photograph: Jarno Artika/The GuardianMatti Pitkäniitty, the commander of the North Karelia border guard district, believes illegal border crossings involving Russian defectors are likely to become a growing problem. Pointing to a gap in the vegetation where an old Finnish country lane passed through before the border was redrawn in 1940 after the Russo-Finnish war, resulting in Helsinki ceding part of Karelia, Pitkäniitty said most civilians trying to cross illegally preferred to stick to roads, limiting the number of potential routes.“People are afraid of those thick forests here,” he said. But this would not be an issue for a Russian military professional trying to flee the war in Ukraine. “Now, one of the risks we are facing are the military-trained personnel fleeing the war. They of course know how to navigate through the woods and how to survive there if they need to stay out of sight for a couple of days.”Finland-Russia border mapWhile it is known that people with military training have fled to the west, it is impossible to know exactly how many may have done so via the Finnish border.“This is not like the Berlin Wall where you have a really good perimeter. There are many more barriers here,” Pitkäniitty said. In addition to the restricted border zone, the border guard relies on technology such as sensors and drones, the natural deterrent of the terrain and the watchful eyes of locals. “So my basic assumption as a professional is that we don’t have a flawless system, there is a possibility that somebody has crossed it illegally, but not in large numbers.”View image in fullscreenCpl Miika Tuhkanen leads attack and defence training for new conscripts.Photograph: Jarno Artika/The GuardianThe prospect of Russian men at the border coming from Ukraine, some of whom may have committed war crimes, was a “big threat” for Finland, Pitkäniitty said, and presented Finnish society – and European border authorities as a whole – with a difficult question. “How do we work with Russian males who have been in the war?”Guards in trainingNorth Karelia’s only road border crossing, Niirala, is now empty but there are still hints of different times, when the road was full of cars with Russian numberplates and North Karelia was a popular holiday destination. Road signs in Russian warn drivers to keep a safe distance from cars ahead. About once a week the crossing still gets a train from Russia carrying non-sanctioned essential goods such as fertiliser.Because of its geography, Finland has long been prepared for war with Russia. It is enshrined in the country’s constitution that every Finnish citizen is obliged to participate in national defence. All men aged 18 to 60 can be called upon for military service. Women are permitted to apply on a voluntary basis.Conscripts are called up in the year they turn 18 and, depending on their wishes and their fitness, training can last from 165 days to almost a year.In the forest near Joensuu, a city of 77,000 people originally established by Tsar Nicholas I of Russia in 1848, the North Karelia border guard is training its latest batch of conscripts, who arrived this summer. After several days living in low-lying tents and learning survival skills, the group, dressed in camouflage with painted faces, are practising moving through the forest in formation, shooting blanks through the trees.View image in fullscreenBorder guards with a dog at the border.Photograph: Jarno Artika/The GuardianThe vast majority of the group are male, but Emma, 19, has put herself forward to do the training. “I think it is important to support your own country,” she said. “I don’t know if I want to do something like this as a career, but it’s a good opportunity for women. I think everyone should join.”Despite North Karelia’s position on one of the highest-stakes geopolitical faultlines, cross-border interrelations continue to some extent. The North Karelian border guards cooperate with their Russian colleagues, who are under the jurisdiction of the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB),on practical issues such as trees falling on the border and forest fires, but not to the extent they did before the invasion of Ukraine.Pitkäniittyused to have 10 meetings a year with his Russian counterpart, communicating via an interpreter; now he has four. Finland’s Nato membership has significantly changed the dynamic. “For Russians, Nato has been historically next to Satan, if not Satan itself. So now we are part of that and it changes how they view the Finns,” Pitkäniitty said.Before the war in Ukraine, he used to joke that “safe” topics to talk about with the Russians included hunting, fishing, berries and mushrooms and sport. Now, with Russia excluded from sporting competitions, one of those has been struck from the list. But, he added, “you can still talk about fishing, hunting and mushrooms”.Explore more on these topicsFinlandRussiaEuropeNatoUkrainenewsShareReuse this content"

What a buzzkill.Because it’s back, baby.Is this about employers forcing people back into the office, citing “culture” and “connection”, but mostly wanting to check employees aren’t slacking?It’s true that there’s been a push from big employers such asAmazonandTescoover the past year to get people back on site, but this is different: in a newBupa survey of 8,000 workers, 45% of gen Z respondents said they were considering looking for jobs with more social interaction.Interesting. Why?Because they’re lonely: 38% of them feel socially isolated because of their work circumstances; that’s more than other generations. “I specifically applied for roles with a physical office where I have supportive colleagues, can socialise at lunchtimes and meet friends in the evenings,” one gen Z worker explained.I thought they wanted to be TikTok content creators not corporate drones?Actually, the influencers were the loneliest of all: 45% said their work made them feel lonely and a third were considering returning to “full-time, traditional employment” in the next five years.Huh.

In times gone by, people would watch television by simply turning their television on, watching whatever was showing at that precise moment and then complaining about it. But now, as you find yourself forced to pick from every single film and series ever made, you feel overwhelmed. You spend entire evenings scrolling through submenu after submenu, glazing over as your inability to find something to watch ossifies into dissociative panic.Can’t pay, won’t pay: impoverished streaming services are driving viewers back to piracyRead moreThe challenge for the streamers is how to effectively curate this infinite content. In the past they have done this by prioritising new releases, or showing you what everyone else is watching, or sharpening their algorithms to second-guess what you want to watch based on what you have already watched. But finally – finally –Netflixhas cracked it. And it has achieved this with science.Sorry, not science,bullshit. Because this weekend Netflix officially launched itsAstrology Hub. Now, after all these years, subscribers can at last pick something to watch based on a loose collection of personality quirks determined by the position of the planets at the time of their birth. Doesn’t that sound great?So, for instance, I am a Leo. And this means that, when I enter the Netflix Astrology Hub and scroll down a bit, I am informed that “Leos have main character energy”. And as such, it means I should watch The Crown, or The King, or Queen Charlotte: A Bridgerton Story, or Emily in Paris, or The Kissing Booth 2, or that Cilla Black biopic that ITV made a few years ago. And I think that, as a heterosexual 45-year-old man, Netflix has absolutely cracked it.Sure, I have already watched most of these for work, and I flat-out disliked almost all of them. But if Netflix says that every single person born within a specific window has the exact same personality, then sure. Tonight, after flopping down on to my sofa at the end of another long day trying to locate the right balance between quality family time and the financial imperative to work, I will watch Emily in bloody Paris. And I will like it, because Netflix told me that I would.View image in fullscreenNetflix’s astrology hub.Photograph: NetflixNow, the naysayers among you will point out that all these choices seem geared to appeal to young girls, because young girls are statistically the demographic most likely to believe in the zodiac, and so the Netflix Astrology Hub is essentially just a bit of a grift designed to push content at one specific group. And you might even go further, by pointing out that astrology is a pseudoscience that has repeatedly proved itself to have no scientific validity whatsoever. To which I respond: of course you think that, you’re a Virgo.And anyway, if there is any message at all behind the Netflix Astrology Hub, it is this: just be grateful that you’re not an Aquarius. Because while the other signs get off relatively lightly – Sagittarians (“bring adventure”) get Indiana Jones and the Spider-Verse, Capricorns (“activate boss mode”) get Hostage and Blackberry, and Virgos (“always hustling”) get Beef and Oppenheimer, the Aquarians are left to mournfully sift through the scraps.Aquarians, according to Netflix, are “otherworldly” and that means their recommendations include the worst Men in Black film, the terrible Battleship film, a bizarre South Korean drama about a gynaecologist who falls in love on a space station and, of course, Rebel Moon – Part One: A Child of Fire. Does this seem like a deliberate decision on the part of Netflix to alienate a full 12th of its subscriber base? Probably, but maybe Aquarians lap this stuff up. I’m not a scientist, so I don’t know.But, still, here we are. Netflix has access to an almost unparalleled set of highly tailored data points about every single one of its subscribers. It knows what you watch, when you watch it and for how long. It knows, with granular precision, more about your viewing habits than you ever will. It changes the image for each piece of content it has, based on your specific desires, to better maximise clicks. By harnessing this universe of data, Netflix is able to individually drip-feed shows and films to you with such dead-on accuracy that it feels like magic. But, in a way, isn’t it better to just blankly state that all Libras like Peaky Blinders and be done with it? I am willing to say yes it is.Explore more on these topicsCultureNetflixUS televisionTelevisionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

While British seaside resorts are struggling amid tough competition from cheap overseas holidays, the lights remain, he said, “an incredibly strong part of people’s leisure heritage”.“The British seaside does have an extraordinary place in everybody’s holiday legacy,” he said. “And this is something that we really focus on with the Blackpool experience.“Come here and remember what it was like when you were your children’s age,” he added. “Come with your parents, come with your grandparents, use this as a way of coming together.”View image in fullscreenBlackpool in 1954.Photograph: Mirrorpix/Getty ImagesHowever, Llewelyn-Bowen said, while the illuminations have formed core memories for generations of children in the north-west in particular, the appeal of the lights has not spread widely beyond the Midlands; “It is a bit of a north-south divide,” he said.“You get to a point where suddenly you just say ‘Blackpool’, and everyone starts getting rather misty-eyed,” he said, “and that carries on as far north as you can go, because it’s always been incredibly popular with the Scots as well.“I always feel rather sorry for the poor mealy mouthed, magnolia-shaded Farrow and Ball-obsessed south,” he added. “Because they never really will get that, they will be kind of quite Brighton-centric, because somehow it’s cool, but actually, there’s nothing cooler than Blackpool, and nothing naughtier as well.”Growing up in London, Llewelyn-Bowen said he himself was a latecomer to the illuminations. “I have no vestigial nostalgia for Blackpool,” he said. “Blackpool was never part of my childhood experience at all.”The radical plan for a futuristic age-friendly neighbourhood in ManchesterRead moreHowever, he said, “it very quickly became part of my children’s childhood … and of course, a big thing now is that my grandchildren are obsessed by this whole thing. So I love the fact that it’s a contagion, that I kind of started myself.”Thanks to his involvement with the illuminations, Llewelyn-Bowen is one of Blackpool’s fiercest advocates, but he was taken by the town even on his first visit, on a very wet November afternoon in the mid-1980s, when he was working for a flooring company, and sent up to the Winter Gardens.“I just didn’t know that somewhere like this existed in the United Kingdom, somewhere where everywhere you looked there was so much design,” he said. “To me, it was like a jacked version of Portmeirion, but in such an incredibly kind of opulent, ornate way.“I mean, Brighton’s got bits of embellishment, everywhere you go in Britain’s seaside-scape, you’ll find some curly, twirly piers, but Blackpool, literally you cannot spit without hitting a furbelow,” he added.“I’ve always just felt that it is in such an incredibly stiff-upper-lip, strait-laced architectural nation, Blackpool is literally the only place, I think, where design really gets to take its bra off in this country, and really just do it for the shits and giggles.”Explore more on these topicsBlackpoolLancashireDesignEnglandfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Residents in Swat have told the Guardian that while the provincial government has started to crack down on illegal construction, a federal minister was among those who had built a resort near a river.Pakistan’s climate change minister, Musadik Malik, says he has been instructed by Sharif to make a plan to deal with the abnormal monsoons, to improve drainage systems and stop illegal construction.“As the PM made it clear, the government won’t spare any powerful person’s illegal construction. We can’t tolerate more deaths and destruction, we have to ensure water drains andnullahs[watercourses] are clear,” Malik says.View image in fullscreenLabourer Mujeeb ur Rehman outside his rented house.

Journalists and rescuers then rushed to the scene to help the wounded, when a second bomb struck the same spot, 15 minutes later.Israel’s attack on hospital in Gaza may constitute a war crime on many frontsRead moreA live video from AlGhad TV captured the moments of their killings, showing civil defence workers wearing bright orange vests and journalists raising their hands to shield themselves seconds before the second bomb kills them. A second video showed the aftermath of the bombings, with the bodies of the first responders and journalists lying on top of one another, bloody and covered in dust.The“double tap” strikeand killing of journalists prompted a wave of international condemnation, including from the UK foreign secretary, David Lammy. “Horrified by Israel’s attack on Nasser hospital. Civilians, healthcare workers and journalists must be protected. We need an immediate ceasefire,” Lammy wrote on X.The US president, Donald Trump, told reporters: “I’m not happy about it,” when asked about the attack, while the French president, Emmanuel Macron, described it as “intolerable”.mapMeanwhile, the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said Israel deeply regretted what he described as a “tragic mishap” at the Nasser hospital.Israel has regularly struck hospitals, claiming without evidence that Hamas uses them for military purposes. It also regularly kills journalists inGaza, on some occasions with the justification that the journalists were associated with Hamas – claims that journalistic bodies have described as baseless.The strikes on Monday killed the Reuters journalist Hussam al-Masri; Mariam Abu Dagga, who worked for the Associated Press; the Al Jazeera journalist Mohammed Salam; the photojournalist Moaz Abu Taha, and Ahmad Abu Aziz from Quds Feed. Another Reuters journalist, Hatem Khaled, was wounded in the attack.At least 193 Palestinian journalists have been killed since 7 October 2023, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), more than the number who died globally in the previous three years.View image in fullscreenMariam Abu Dagga pictured in Khan Younis in June.Photograph: Jehad Alshrafi/APThe CPJ condemned the Israeli strike and called for action from the international community. “Israel’s broadcasted killing of journalists in Gaza continues while the world watches and fails to act firmly on the most horrific attacks the press has faced in recent history,” said its regional director, Sara Qudah. “These unlawful killings must end now. The perpetrators must no longer be allowed to act with impunity.”The Associated Press said it was shocked and saddened to learn of Dagga’s death, as well as the deaths of the other journalists killed alongside her. “We are doing everything we can to keep our journalists in Gaza safe as they continue to provide crucial eyewitness reporting in difficult and dangerous conditions,” the agency said.Reuters said it was devastated at the news of the death of Masri and wounding of Khaled. “We are urgently seeking more information and have asked authorities in Gaza and Israel to help us get urgent medical assistance for Hatem,” a spokesperson said.View image in fullscreenThe damaged fourth floor of the Nasser hospital after the Israeli strike.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesA spokesperson for the Israeli military said the chief-of-staff had ordered a preliminary investigation into the strike and said Israel “expressed regret for injury to uninvolved personnel”. Israel “does not target journalists as such”, they said.Israeli inquiries into misconduct by its military rarely ensure accountability.

She reported on Nasser hospital doctors struggling to save children with no previous health issues who were wasting away from starvation.Independent Arabia said Dagga was the “example of dedication and professional commitment” and that she had carried “her camera into the heart of the field, conveying the suffering of civilians and the voices of victims with rare honesty and courage”.Dagga had forbidden crying at her funeral, a colleague and friend said.“Mariam had left us instructions not to cry for her when we bid her farewell. She wanted us to spend time with her body, speak to her and take our fill of her before she left,” said Samaheer Farhan, a 21-year-old freelance journalist and friend of Dagga.Dagga, like other journalists in Gaza, had written a will in case she was killed while reporting. She left behind a letter for her 13-year-old son, Ghaith, telling him: “Make me proud … become successful and excel.”Abu Aziz was based in the Nasser hospital, where he covered the impact of Israel’s attacks on people across Gaza. He had lost several colleagues during the war, as well as his own home, which was levelled in a strike. “It felt like I was all alone and the only one left on the ground as so many more of my colleagues were being killed,” Abu Aziz wrote in an article for Middle East Eye a year ago about his experience as a journalist in Gaza.Al Jazeera confirmed that Salam was among those killed in the Nasser hospital strike. Reuters reported that Masri, a contractor cameraman, was also killed. Khaled, a photographer who was also a Reuters contractor, was wounded, the news agency reported.Israel has prevented international media from covering the 22-month conflict, an unprecedented ban in the history of war reporting. Palestinian journalists in Gaza who work with international outlets carry out their duties while facing starvation and the risk of death.Q&AWhy is it so difficult to report on Gaza?ShowCoverage of the war in Gaza is constrained by Israeli attacks on Palestinian journalists and a bar on international reporters entering the Gaza Strip to report independently on the war.Israel has not allowed foreign reporters to enter Gaza since 7 October 2023, unless they are under Israeli military escort. Reporters who join these trips have no control over where they go, and otherrestrictionsinclude a bar on speaking to Palestinians in Gaza.Palestinian journalists and media workers inside Gaza have paid a heavy price for their work reporting on the war, with over180 killedsince the conflict began.The committee to protect journalists has determined that at least 19 of them “were directly targeted by Israeli forces in killings which CPJ classifies as murders”.Foreign reporters based in Israel filed alegal petitionseeking access to Gaza, but it was rejected by the supreme court on security grounds. Private lobbying by diplomats and public appeals byprominent journalistsandmedia outletshave been ignored by the Israeli government.To ensure accurate reporting from Gaza given these restrictions, the Guardian works with trusted journalists on the ground; our visual​​ teams verif​y photo and videos from third parties; and we use clearly sourced data from organisations that have a track record of providing accurate information in Gaza during past conflicts, or during other conflicts or humanitarian crises.Emma Graham-Harrison, chief Middle East correspondentWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.The Palestinian ministry of health said Monday’s strikes on the Nasser hospital had disrupted surgery in the operating theatre. It condemned the attack, which it said was part of a “systematic destruction of the health system”.

Israel is preparing for an invasion of the city in the coming days, which it says it will occupy and take control of.Aid groups have said the operation would lead to displacement and a humanitarian disaster in Gaza, which is already in the throes of famine.At least 62,686 Palestinians have been killed since the beginning of the Gaza war 22 months ago.

Is Keir Starmer on the side of the British people, national security and protecting women and girls – or is he on the side of outdated international treaties and human rights lawyers?”Farage’s intervention comes after a Times poll by YouGov found that 71% of voters believe Keir Starmer is handling the asylum seeker hotel crisis poorly, including a majority ofLaboursupporters. The findings have intensified pressure on ministers to demonstrate visible progress before a winter in which the use of hotels remains one of the most politically fraught aspects of the small boats crisis.Eagle, the border security and asylum minister, said Reform’s plans were unworkable and accused theConservativesof leaving behind a broken system.“This government inherited chaos in the asylum system and a border security system in tatters,” she said. “Since the election we have been rebuilding the foundations of both, saving £1bn in asylum accommodation costs, increasing removals of those with no right to be here, and bringing forward new laws to make it easier to deport sex offenders, which both Reform and the Tories voted against.“Under the Tories we had years of fantasy solutions, which we were told would stop the boats, but which simply cost a fortune and had no impact. Reform look to be offering more of the same. These are back-of-the-fag packet plans without the substance on delivery.“Illegal migration is a complex, global problem requiring serious and sustainable policies, including working closely with partners overseas. Only the Labour government is offering that kind of plan.”A government source said “by the end of the year at least five more hotels are expected to be closed, with a big surge in closures in the new year”, describing the move as part of a wider effort to end hotel use entirely.The number of hotels accommodating asylum seekers has fallen from a peak of 400 in 2023, when costs reached £9m a day, to just more than 200 now, with a reduced daily cost of £5.5m, insiders say. In the first half of this year alone, the number of asylum seekers living in hotels fell by 6,000 – a 16% reduction.1:19Protesters clash at asylum hotel demonstrations across the UK – videoHome Office figures show overall asylum costs have dropped by 11%, delivering £1bn in savings last year and a forecast of at least another £1bn to be saved next year. Ministers argue the closures show tangible progress, even as critics continue to highlight delays in processing claims and challenges in securing alternative housing.Rising public anger over asylum accommodation has been fuelled by high-profile criminal cases and violent incidents. The Scottish Tory leader, Russell Findlay, defended protests outside a hotel housing asylum seekers after Sadeq Nikzad, a 29-year-old Afghan migrant, was jailed for nine years in June for the rape of a 15-year-old girl in October 2023.Findlay said: “It’s understandable in those circumstances why communities would question the entire integrity and safety of the immigration system. As long as that’s being done lawfully and respectfully that is an entirely right way to protest.”The fallout from the Epping asylum hotel ruling has also escalated tensions. The high court recently ordered theremoval of asylum seekers from the Bell hotel in Essexafter local Conservative-led councils mounted a legal challenge. The decision hasemboldened other councils to consider similar action.Kemi Badenoch, leader of the Conservatives, is hosting a call on Tuesday with Tory councillors, planning law experts and senior party strategists to discuss how councils can coordinate further legal challenges. Attenders include Lord Charles Banner KC; the shadow home secretary, Chris Philp; James Cleverly, the shadow housing secretary; Holly Whitbread, a cabinet member at Epping Forest council; and John Cope, the chair of the Conservative councillors’ association.Members of far-right party organising asylum hotel protests across UK, Facebook posts showRead moreThe Guardian understands the session will aim to “help and encourage Conservative councils to take the lead in fighting to close asylum hotels in their constituency” and “give genuine advice based on a serious plan of action”.A two-day trial begins on Tuesday at Chelmsford crown court of a man charged with the sexual assault of a 14-year-old girl outside the Bell hotel – a case that has fuelled anger locally and sparked fresh protests across Essex.Despite highlighting falling costs, declining hotel use and tougher enforcement, Labour remains under political pressure. The government has pointed to new deals with France, Bulgaria, Romania, India, Vietnam and Iraq aimed at disrupting trafficking and speeding removals.AUK-France treatysigned in July has already led to detentions, insiders say, while the “deport now appeal later” scheme has expanded to 23 countries, with 66 charter flights removing hundreds, including serious offenders, in the past year.Explore more on these topicsImmigration and asylumHome OfficeLabourConservativesReform UKnewsShareReuse this content"

There is no ‘honour’ in them. For too long, these offences have often been misunderstood by professionals, resulting in victims not getting the support they deserve.“Today we are announcing measures to put an end to this and shining a light on this debilitating abuse. This marks a crucial step in this government’s landmark mission to halve violence against women and girls within a decade.”As part of the changes, the national centre for violence against women and girls and public protection is working with the police to improve how officers assess the risks posed by “honour”-based abuse offenders. The Home Office will also pilot a study looking at how widespread this crime is.Emma James, the national policing lead for “honour”-based abuse, said it was a “complex crime” that often happened within community or family networks, making it difficult for victims to speak out for fear of further threats, violence and isolation.“That’s why it’s so important that policing works closely with other agencies to identify abuse and protect victims at the earliest opportunity,” she said.Recent statistics showed that 2,755 offences related to “honour”-based abuse were recorded by the police in England and Wales, including killings, female genital mutilation and forced marriage. Figurespublishedlast year found that the number of “honour”-based abuse offences recorded by English police forces had increased by more than 60% in two years, thought to be due to more victims coming forward, as well as political polarisation.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Natasha Rattu, the charity’s executive director, hailed the move as a “landmark moment” after years of campaigning for a statutory definition.“This step will mean victims are no longer overlooked but seen, heard and supported, while professionals are better equipped to act,” she said.Payzee Mahmod, a campaigner who is a survivor of child marriage and “honour”-based abuse, and whose sister, Banaz, died in an “honour”-based killing, added: “I know how vital it is that professionals from the police to social workers and teachers have the clarity and tools they need to recognise this abuse and act quickly to protect those at risk. This step represents meaningful progress towards better safeguarding and ensuring that survivors are properly seen, heard and supported,” she said.Yasmin Javed, whose daughterFawziyah Javed was pushed off Arthur’s Seatin Edinburgh, Scotland by her husband after learning she was pregnant and had planned to leave the marriage, said she was “pleased” the government had listened to calls from campaigners. “I hope that this will help many more people affected by HBA and ensure that the multiple perpetrators of this abuse are properly recognised and addressed,” she added.Explore more on these topicsDomestic violenceViolence against women and girlsLabournewsShareReuse this content"

The war he has caused is appalling. But, whatever politicians have done, I don’t feel cutting off artistic conversations is ever a good way to help.”Allen had appeared on Sunday atMoscow international film week, via a remote link for a session hosted by film-maker Fyodor Bondarchuk, a long-term political ally of Putin and director of patriotic epics such as Stalingrad (2013) and the sci-fi filmAttraction.In a statement posted on social media, the ministry said: “Woody Allen’s participation in the Moscow international film week is a disgrace and an insult to the sacrifice of Ukrainian actors and film-makers who have been killed or injured by Russian war criminals in their ongoing war against Ukraine.”It added: “By taking part in a festival that brings together Putin’s supporters and voices, Allen chooses to turn a blind eye to the atrocitiesRussiacommits in Ukraine every single day for 11 years now. Culture must never be used to whitewash crimes or serve as a propaganda tool. We strongly condemn Woody Allen’s decision to bless Moscow’s bloody festival with his address.”According to reports inRussian media, Allen said that he had no plans to make a film in Russia but that he had “only good feelings for Moscow and St Petersburg”.Allen also reportedly said he admired Russian cinema, singling out the four-film literary adaptation War and Peace, directed by Bondarchuk’s father Sergei, which won the Oscar for best foreign language film in 1969.Allen’s last two films have been made with financial backing from European sources:Rifkin’s Festivalin Spain, released in 2020, andCoup de Chancein France, released in 2023. This followed the cancellation of hisproduction arrangement with Amazonin 2019; Allen sued Amazon and settled out of court. His legal dispute with Amazon followedan open letter published by Dylan Farrow in 2014renewing the allegations that Allen had sexually abused her when she was seven, which Allen denies and of which he has been cleared after two investigations.In 2024, Allensuggested he may retire,saying: “All the romance of film-making is gone.”Explore more on these topicsFilmWoody AllenRussiaUkraineEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Most of that clothing has been resold by charity partner Oxfam.As growth in donations has slowed, M&S is trying something new and will reward customers for Oxfam donations containing at least one M&S item with a £5 voucher when they spend £35 in its stores or online.To use the service customers must complete a short form on its website or scan a QR code in stores, then send their preloved items using a free local courier service to Reskinned, a repair and resale specialist.View image in fullscreeneBay x Marks & Spencer launch campaign.Photograph: Marks & Spencer/eBayThe best M&S items that can be worn again will be professionally cleaned, repaired by Reskinned then listed on the M&S eBay store. Items that cannot be resold will be responsibly repurposed or recycled.Oxfam will take a 15% share of M&S’s profits from the eBay sales and the rest will be split between the retailer, eBay and Reskinned. The charity will also continue to sell donated clothes, including non-M&S branded items that are not selected for the eBay store directly in its outlets.Katharine Beacham, the head of sustainability in fashion for M&S, said it had led the way with “shwopping”, which had “shifted the way people looked at clothes”. “We wanted to revamp shwopping to continue to improve how customers look at clothing and how they can give clothes another life.”The partnership with eBay gave M&S an opportunity to learn what customers were looking for from resale, she said. The company would consider how successful the eBay store was before potentially selling secondhand items via its own stores or website.The change in setup comes amid rapid growth in the sale of secondhand clothes online, with M&S one of the most searched for brands on eBay.Depop, the London-based secondhand clothing marketplace, is on track for $1bn (£740m) of annual sales for the first time, its owner, Etsy, said recently, after a 35% surge in sales to $250m in the three months to 30 June. The company said growth was driven by a 54% jump in sales in the US as it signed up a record number of new shoppers.Its rival Vinted reported a 41% rise in sales to almost €813m (£704m) for 2024 with profits almost tripling to €95.4m after the companystepped out of the red for the first timein 2023.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Might Alexander Isak have felt the tiniest bit guilty at the sight of his increasingly overwrought understudy, Anthony Gordon, missing a couple of extremely presentable chances before being sent off for a ridiculous first-half tackle on Virgil van Dijk?And how did Newcastle’s currently striking star striker assess Hugo ­Ekitiké’s attacking performance forLiverpool? Even as Isak continues to endeavour to engineer a move to Anfield, did he celebrate Will Osula’s unexpected late Newcastle leveller to make it 2-2? What, precisely, did he feel when the 16-year-old visiting substitute Rio Ngumoha won it for the champions in the 100th minute?Bruno Guimarães harnesses red mist to become Newcastle’s last man standingRead moreGiven that the Sweden striker was watching from up the road in Northumberland, we will never know, but one thing was abundantly clear: the emotions engendered by the ­summer’s longest and most ­acrimonious transfer saga provoked a night of compelling, sometimes downright wild drama. As Liverpool’s manager Arne Slot said afterwards: “I’m not sure it was a football match today.”By kick-off it had been dubbed “El Isako” and Ryan Gravenberch’s booking for a wince-inducing tackle on Bruno Guimarães swiftly set the tone as this 100mph rerun oflast season’s Carabao Cup finalopened in highly charged, almost anarchic mode.If Liverpool wanted revenge for that Wembley defeat, the sheer, feral fury of a Newcastle crowd incensed by Slot’s pursuit of Isak and Liverpool’s perceived audacity in hijacking Howe’s move for Ekitiké transmitted itself to an electrically charged home team.Before too long Gordon would self-destruct but, for a while, he rattled Liverpool. The England winger, once again deputising for Isak out of position at centre-forward, may not be exactly reliable in front of goal but he remains extremely clever at winning dangerous free-kicks. Accordingly Slot twice lost his cool after complaining that Gordon dives had earned Newcastle underserved set-pieces.View image in fullscreenVirgil van Dijk shows the injury on his right calf after the tackle by Anthony Gordon that earned the Newcastle striker a red card.Photograph: Daniel Chesterton/Offside/Getty ImagesIt was left to a deep-sitting Van Dijk and company to stay calm and slow the tempo at every opportunity. At times they lived dangerously and Alisson Becker looked relieved to see Gordon head fractionally over the bar from Harvey Barnes’s cross. But the impressive approach work of the excellent Sandro Tonali was repeatedly undone by the lack of a specialist striker.The directors’ box contained Newcastle’s chair, Yasir al-Rumayyan – making a rare visit from Riyadh – flanked by a sizeable, and serious looking delegation from the club’s owners, Saudi Arabia’s ­Public Investment Fund. On Monday afternoonsome members of that delegation joined ­Newcastle’s minority owner, Jamie Reuben, in visiting Isak at home to try to persuade him into a change of heart.Considering that earlier in the day Wolves had rejected a £50m bid from St James’ Park for their striker Jørgen Strand Larsen, the boardroom chat with Liverpool executives can hardly have been dull.Neither was a match that was ­initially dominated by a home side who, nonetheless, fell behind when an unsighted Nick Pope was beaten by ­Gravenberch’s low, slightly deflected shot from the edge of the area in the 35th minute.Pope enjoyed a reprieve when Mohamed Salah’s subtly curving cross proved just slightly too clever for a startled looking Ekitiké. But then an intervention by the video assistant referee resulted in Gordon’s ­dismissal for poleaxing Van Dijk with an unpleasant, unnecessary and utterly brainless tackle from behind.Given that it involved the boyhood Liverpool fan lunging into the back of the defender’s standing leg as Van Dijk attempted to clear the ball, ­Gordon could hardly complain.Howe’s players had arguably paid the price for playing on the edge. ­Initially all this black-and-white adrenaline had unnerved and ­unsettled Slot’s side but, not for the first time, Gordon carried things too far and imploded.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The Frenchman’s burst beyond Tonali and his pass to the left cued up Cody Gakpo. When the Dutchman’s ensuing shot was blocked, Ekitiké reacted first to the rebound, drilling an unstoppable shot past Pope.View image in fullscreenWilliam Osula (left) celebrates with Bruno Guimarães and Dan Burn after his 88th-minute equaliser.Photograph: Andy Buchanan/AFP/Getty ImagesEither side of their goals, Liverpool had taken surprisingly few touches in Newcastle’s area but their efficiency when it mattered most had hurt their hosts.Not that it was quite over just yet. When Tino Livramento curled a cross into the area, Guimarães capitalised on slapdash defending by Milos Kerkez to head Newcastle’s 10 men right back into things in the 57th minute.Suddenly Liverpool almost looked the team at a numerical disadvantage, but then injuries began stemming the tide of the black-and-white waves. Newcastle could certainly have done without losing Tonali, with a nasty looking shoulder injury, before the influential Joelinton limped off as Jacob Ramsey stepped off the bench to make his home debut following a £40m move from Aston Villa.Ramsey, though, was not the night’s most influential home ­substitute. That accolade belonged to Osula. The Denmark Under-21 ­forward may not be quite the ­finished article but he is at least a proper centre-forward and when Dan Burn overpowered Ibrahima Konaté in the tussle to meet Pope’s long kick, he nipped in, stretched out a boot and equalised with two minutes of ­normal time to go.Unfortunately for Howe a visiting replacement proved an even bigger gamechanger. Ngumoha marked hisPremier Leaguedebut by becoming the youngest scorer in Liverpool’s history after curling a sumptuous shot beyond Pope at the end of a gloriously fluent attacking move. Maybe Slot doesn’t need Isak after all.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueNewcastle UnitedLiverpoolmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

In the same period last year there were 21 incidents.The strait of Malacca, a narrow but key stretch of water located between Singapore, Malaysia, andIndonesia, is essential for global trade. It serves as a crucial maritime corridor between the Indian Ocean to the Pacific, via the South China Sea.Spanish tourists robbed by armed ‘river pirates’ in Peruvian AmazonRead moreA large portion of piracy and robbery incidents this year occurred in the Phillip Channel of the Singapore strait, where vessels are forced to slow down to navigate the narrow waterway, said Vijay Chafekar, ReCAAP ISC’s executive director.Most thefts were opportunistic and non-confrontational, with crew left unharmed, he said.According to the National Bureau of Asian Research, the strait is a regional “chokepoint” with an estimated 90,000 merchant vessels and 60% of global maritime trade passing through it annually.None of the 2025 incidents in the straits were classified as Category 1 – the most serious type involving firearms or hostage-taking – and 90% resulted in no injuries, according to ReCAAP data.Seven confrontations involved knives or replica weapons, and one crew member sustained a minor injury. Bulk carriers were the most frequently targeted ships (52%), followed by tankers (24%) and container vessels (11%).Analysts are divided on what is behind the spike, with some suggesting a link between increased maritime traffic caused by vessels seeking to divert from the Red Sea trade route, which has beenincreasingly disrupted by Yemen’s Houthi rebelsattacking commercial vessels.Perpetrators of the 2025 incidents were often part of low-level organised crime groups operating from remote Indonesian islands such as the Riau and Cula islands, said Daniel Ng, from the Asian Shipowners’ Association (ASA).“They operate in sampans [flat-bottomed wooden boats] to approach ships, often in the hours of darkness. They climb aboard using long poles with hooks and ropes.”Ng said the rise in cases could be linked to perpetrators becoming increasingly adept at finding “loopholes” to breach shipboard security, using Automatic Identification System (AIS) mobile data to their advantage.“They are often facing financial hardship due to factors like unemployment and poverty, they need to supplement income and appear to be becoming more skilled in breaching security measures.”A spokesperson for the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) said the surge in incidents was “concerning” and urged all ships to follow best management practices and promptly report incidents to the relevant authorities.Explore more on these topicsSingaporeIndonesiaPiracy at seaAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

They urged those already on site to“secure your structures and belongings”and to not drive.By early Monday, organizers said that conditions had improved and at 7.30am local time, organizers said that thegate was openand that the airport had resumed function.In the statement on Monday, the festival organizers said that “due to variable weather conditions over the past few days, wait times from the 8-mile playa entrance on County Route 34 to the Gate are expected to range 6-8 hours today but could change with the weather”.But the grim weather conditions may not be over yet. Organizers also warned that Monday’s forecast includes “potential precipitation” in the afternoon and early evening and that the “weather continues to be unstable and is expected to be unstable for two more days”.They urged attendees to “keep an eye on the forecast as you plan your travel to Black Rock City” and to “plan for additional potential weather related delays”.The NWS in Elkohas warnedthat “monsoonal moisture will stream northward into most of Northern and Central Nevada today through Thursday, resulting in the likelihood of wetting thunderstorms each afternoon and evening” and that “heavy rain may cause minor flooding of recent burn scars, streams, and creeks”.Roughly 70,000 people are expected to attend this year’s festival, which runs through 1 September, according toNBC News.The situation was reminiscent of the disastrous weather that plagued the event in 2023, when heavy rainstranded tens of thousandsat the festival,turning the site into a mud pitand prompting emergency shelter-in-place orders.

Now, Vance and others in Trump’s orbit were apparently sounding out potential alternatives to the troublesome Zelenskyy.Vance’s team “tried various diplomatic and other channels” to get through to Zaluzhnyi, said one of three sources with knowledge of the efforts who spoke with the Guardian. Zaluzhnyi, after consultation with Zelenskyy’s chief of staff, refused to take the call.A White House official told the Guardian the attempted call was “standard diplomatic outreach” on the part of Vance. “The vice president regularly interacts with government officials from Ukraine and our European allies,” said the official.The episode was reflective of the political tightrope that Zaluzhnyi has walked since Zelenskyy dismissed him as army chief last February and dispatched him to London. On the one hand, accustomed to working within a strict military hierarchy, Zaluzhnyi remains loyal to the government he serves. On the other, many – both at home and abroad – see him as Ukraine’s natural next president, and are pushing him to launch a political campaign.View image in fullscreenJD Vance was instrumental in provoking the confrontation between Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Donald Trump.Photograph: ABACA/REX/ShutterstockThis account is based on interviews with several people close to Zaluzhnyi, as well as political insiders, diplomats and others with direct knowledge of the described events. Most requested anonymity, given the sensitivity of the topic. Many of the details are being reported for the first time.No election is scheduled in Ukraine, with voting legally and technically impossible while the country is at war. Even Zelenskyy’s staunchest domestic opponents do not support holding a vote now, and since the Oval Office disaster, relations with Trump have also improved. Last week, the Ukrainian president was back at the White Housein a more cordial atmosphere.But everyone in Ukraine knows that sooner or later, politics will return. And when that happens, polling suggests that Zaluzhnyi, who led the successful repelling of the Russian onslaught at the beginning of the war, is the only candidate who would pose a serious threat to Zelenskyy.Zaluzhnyi has never publicly declared any political ambitions, and declines almost all interview requests. His team carefully manages his public appearances in London to avoid events where awkward questions could be asked. But there has been a steady flow of political pilgrims to the Ukrainian embassy, located in a mansion near Holland Park, west London, to offer services, express support or try to divine whether the general has plans to run for office.Those visitors have included Ukrainian MPs, civil society activists, representatives of wealthy businesspeople and even the disgraced former Trump adviser Paul Manafort, who visited Zaluzhnyi to pitch his services as a political consultant in any future election campaign. Zaluzhnyi turned down the offer.View image in fullscreenValerii Zaluzhnyi, Ukraine’s ambassador to the UK, meets King Charles during a private audience at Buckingham Palace in February.Photograph: Yui Mok/APAnother frequent visitor has been Andriy Yermak, Zelenskyy’s powerful chief of staff. In a meeting last November, said a knowledgable source, Yermak suggested to Zaluzhnyi that he should formally join the president’s political team, to present a united front before future elections.Zaluzhnyi declined, but also pledged loyalty, up to a point. He promised Yermak he would not criticise Zelenskyy in public while the war continued, said the source, and also gave assurances he would not give the presidential office any nasty surprises. “If I do decide I want to go into politics, you will hear it from me first, privately,” Zaluzhnyi told Yermak.So far, Zaluzhnyi has not communicated that message, although there is an increasing belief in Kyiv that he is readying a political run. The general is coy even privately with close associates about his plans, but many assume he is just biding his time before entering the fray.“He has chosen the smartest tactic,” said Volodymyr Fesenko, a Kyiv-based political analyst. “He will make the final decision only at the last moment, just before elections.”Zaluzhnyi was 48 when Zelenskyy promoted him to commander in chief in July 2021, a move which came as a surprise to most of the army top brass, including the man himself.“Zaluzhnyi was a bold and ambitious commander, but he was also a bit of a goofball, better known for clowning around with his troops than disciplining them,” wrote journalist Simon Shuster in his biography of Zelenskyy. It was exactly this personable, unconventional streak that appealed to Zelenskyy, the former comedian and actor who had sensationally ascended to the presidency two years earlier.View image in fullscreenValerii Zaluzhnyi attends an official ceremony in Kyiv to mark the first anniversary of the Russian invasion.Photograph: Presidential Press Service Handout Handout/EPAA few months after Zaluzhnyi’s appointment, Russia began massing troops across the border. The Biden administration warned publicly that Vladimir Putin could be planning a full-scale invasion of Ukraine. In the months between those first US warnings in October 2021 and the invasion in February 2022, Zaluzhnyi frequently pushed for more intensive preparations for a possible Russian attack. Zelenskyy, however, was unsure the invasion scare was real, and felt that even it was, excessive preparation would sow panic among the population and could give the Russians the excuse they were looking for to invade.At a meeting of Ukraine’s security council on 22 February, Zaluzhnyi and the then defence minister, Oleksiy Reznikov, spoke in favour of introducing martial law, while Zelenskyy still worried about creating panic. In the end, the council voted to adopt lesser measures. Russia invaded two days later. These disagreements over the preparations for war, which mostly took place in private and were overshadowed by Zelenskyy’s heroic stand after the invasion began, could come back into focus if there is indeed an electoral battle between the two men.Once the invasion happened, Zelenskyy initially left military strategy to his commander, while he focused on marshalling international support for Kyiv. Zelenskyy became the international symbol of Ukrainian resilience; Zaluzhnyi achieved cult status inside the country as a war hero.As the conflict dragged on, however, there was increasing tension between the two men. Almost every strategy meeting ended in disagreement. There was also a growing uneasiness among the presidential team about Zaluzhnyi’s popularity, as shown by secret internal polling. He seemed to be developing an untouchable mythical status.View image in fullscreenValerii Zaluzhnyi poses for a photograph with Volodymyr Zelenskyy to prove there was no bad blood after being dismissed as army chief.Photograph: APBy February last year, Zelenskyy had had enough. After months of speculation, hedismissed Zaluzhnyiand announced he was sending him to London as ambassador, claiming the army needed an injection of new ideas. “This is not about names, and even more so, not about politics,” the president said, explaining the decision at the time. Few believed him. But Zaluzhnyi took his new orders calmly. During a private meeting, the two men parted on a warm note, and Zaluzhnyi even posed for a photograph with Zelenskyy to prove there was no bad blood. It was the last time they had a sit-down meeting.When Zaluzhnyi arrived in London, the British establishment realised this new diplomatic relationship would requite delicate handling. Many senior officials had become close to Zaluzhnyi and his team during the war, but keeping him involved in military planning discussions might irritate the Zelenskyy administration, they realised, and show disrespect to Oleksandr Syrskyi, Zaluzhnyi’s replacement as army chief.“The decision was made that regardless of many warm personal connections, the relationship would be reset to a more traditional diplomatic relationship, led by the Foreign Office,” said a British defence official.For Zaluzhnyi, who had spent the first two years of the war in a prolonged state of adrenaline-fuelled sleep deprivation, the new life in London was a strange transition. He posted selfies with his wife from tube platforms and walks along the Thames.View image in fullscreenValerii Zaluzhnyi, with his wife, Olena, on Tower Bridge in London, March 2025.Photograph: @zaluzhnyi_valerii/InstagramThe couple even made the occasional trip to the theatre, including a pre-Christmas visit to see the play Barcelona, starring Lily Collins. The unusually intense security sweep of the building before the performance led staff there to assume a member of the royal family would be visiting, said a source at the theatre. There was confusion when the secret VIP couple arrived and nobody recognised them.Back home, where Zaluzhnyi has the second-most recognisable face in the country, photographs from his new life have not always gone down well. A moody black-and-white photoshoot for Ukrainian Vogue recently launched a slew of sarcastic memes. But Zaluzhnyi has also stayed in touch with many army commanders, and follows combat activities from secure video screens in his office that beam live footage from the battlefield. “Valerii Fedorovych has left the war, but the war has not left Valerii Fedorovych,” said an associate, using Zaluzhnyi’s name and patronymic.In private conversations, Zaluzhnyi has not confirmed he plans to go into politics, but he has allowed himself to speculate on what kind of platform he could propose if he does make the decision. Those close to him say he sees Israel as a model, despite its current bloody actions in Gaza, viewing it as a small country surrounded by enemies and fully focused on defence.He would style himself as a tough, wartime leader who would promise “blood, sweat and tears” to the Ukrainian people in return for saving the nation, channelling Winston Churchill. In one private conversation, he said: “I don’t know if the Ukrainian people will be ready for that, ready for these tough policies.”After Trump humiliated Zelenskyy in the Oval Office in February, the Ukrainian president flew to London to strategise with Keir Starmer on how best to mend the relationship. The situation looked dire, and some in the US administration were openly discussing what mechanisms they might be able to use to replace the Ukrainian president. “I don’t know if we can ever work with Zelenskyy again,” said the Republican senator Lindsey Graham, publicly suggesting Zelenskyy should resign. Soon after, Vance’s office tried to place the call to Zaluzhnyi.View image in fullscreenValerii Zaluzhnyi has the second-most recognisable face in Ukraine and is considered a war hero.Photograph: Global Images Ukraine/Getty ImagesFor Zaluzhnyi, whatever bad blood there was with Zelenskyy, siding with the Trump team against his own president was not an option. He met Zelenskyy at the airport in London, and posted on his social media channels a photograph of the two men shaking hands. “The road ahead won’t be easy, but together, we will overcome every challenge,” he wrote. It was a demonstrative show of unity at what was one of Ukraine’s lowest moments since the start of the full-scale invasion.“A lot of his supporters didn’t understand why he did this,” said a source close to Zaluzhnyi. “But it was his principled position: Ukraine has been humiliated and we have to be united.”This cautiousness has started to frustrate some Zelenskyy opponents in Kyiv, who feel Zaluzhnyi offers their best chance of political change. “He’s a military guy, he understands taking orders and working within a structure, but he doesn’t understand how to go on manoeuvres politically,” said a former senior official, who hopes to persuade Zaluzhnyi to run. “A real leader should have taken the Vance call, he should be making moves. But how to convince him?”Another source, who knows Zaluzhnyi and is also a former senior official, said the general would be too wary of internal destabilisation to launch a political campaign against Zelenskyy. “I don’t believe in the battle of the two Zs, it would be a disaster for the country and I don’t think he is ready for that. So I think he would only stand if Zelenskyy can be persuaded to step aside,” said the source.Last month, Zaluzhnyi arrived in Kyiv, for a six-day summit of Ukrainian ambassadors. The envoys listened to speeches from Zelenskyy and military leaders, and visited areas close to the frontline in Zaporizhzhia region. For most of the diplomats, it was a rare firsthand taste of the war to take back to their host countries. For Zaluzhnyi, it must have been a surreal experience to return to the front as part of a diplomatic junket.“He was friendly, but cautious,” said another ambassador who was present. “You could see he was wary of being too open with people he didn’t know personally; he doesn’t know who is on which side.”View image in fullscreenProtesters demonstrate against plans to remove the independence of the two anti-corruption agencies in Kyiv in July.Photograph: Tetiana Dzhafarova/AFP/Getty ImagesBy chance, the summit meant Zaluzhnyi was in Kyiv during awave of street protestsagainst a government plan to neuter two anti-corruption bodies. The rallies spooked Zelenskyy’s team and led to a swift U-turn. Some hoped this could be the moment Zaluzhnyi broke publicly with Zelenskyy. “A lot of people were waiting for him to say something, but he was silent,” said Inna Sovsun, an opposition MP.After the summit, Zaluzhnyi stayed on for a week in Kyiv and took numerous meetings with various political and civic figures. Rumours swirled that he was finally sounding out members of a future political team.Those around him deny the discussions were about politics. “He has said many times that while the war is going on, we have to work to save the country and not think about elections, and that has not changed,” said Oksana Torop, a former BBC journalist now working as a media adviser to Zaluzhnyi. “He talks with lots of people about defence and security, but this is nothing to do with elections,” she added.Asked whether the presidential office views Zaluzhnyi as a political threat, the Zelenskyy aide Mykhailo Podolyak said: “Zaluzhnyi is seen by the president as a part of the team, as an ambassador in an important country … Anyway, there is no real political process at the moment.”What about when those political processes restart, whenever that may be? “I’m not ready to say what would happen then, and how different people might act,” said Podolyak. “It’s all very unpredictable.”Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

She left behind two sets of instructions: to her colleagues, do not cry at her funeral; to her 13-year-old son, Ghaith, make her proud.Despite her instructions, Dagga’s colleagues could not help but weep over her body on Monday. She was killed by Israel,alongside four other journalists, while rushing to check on a colleague struck by Israel in al-Nasser hospital, where she had often reported throughout the war in Gaza.“Mariam had left us instructions not to cry for her when we bid her farewell. She wanted us to spend time with her body, speak to her and take our fill of her before she left,” said Samaheer Farhan, a 21-year-old freelance journalist and close friend of Dagga.Israel bombed Gaza hospital a second time, killing rescuers, say health officialsRead moreThe 33-year-old photojournalist was an inspiring figure to Farhan and many other journalists in Gaza who admired her relentless reporting, despite the often deeply personal losses she suffered throughout the war.Her rise to prominence as a journalist began with tragedy. She filmed the death of a protester who was shot during the 2018 Great March of Return in Gaza, where Israeli forces shot protesters marching towards the Gaza border fence, killing more than 220 people and wounding more than 9,200. She later discovered that the protester was her brother.Dagga continued her work as a journalist during the war in Gaza over the last 22 months, working as a freelancer with the Associated Press and Independent Arabia.Independent Arabia said that she was the “example of dedication and professional commitment”, and praised her for carrying “her camera into the heart of the field, conveying the suffering of civilians and the voices of victims with rare honesty and courage”.Her photography and reporting highlighted the humanity of her subjects and focused on the suffering of civilians in Gaza.1:03Journalists among 20 Palestinians killed in Israeli strike on Gaza hospital – videoHer photo of five-year-old Jamal al-Najjar, who died of malnutrition just weeks earlier, portrayed the child tenderly, his small body wrapped in a shroud and placed gently on bricks so that he did not touch the ground. Another photo showed dozens of men scrambling to get food from an aid truck in southern Gaza, a mess of bodies as they desperately compete for scarce aid.To her colleagues, she was known also for her kindness and dedication.“Mariam was kind, gentle and deeply passionate about her work. She had lost her mother and her closest colleague, Abu Anas, yet she never stopped covering the war for even a single day,” Farhan said.They also described her as having a reputation for fearlessness, reporting from some of the most dangerous areas of Gaza.View image in fullscreenMariam Dagga’s colleagues described her as ‘kind, gentle, and deeply passionate about her work’.Photograph: Bashar Taleb/AFP/Getty ImagesLike other members of the Gaza press corps, she knew the danger of being a journalist in the Palestinian territory.The war in Gaza has been the deadliest period ever for journalists, killing more than 192 Palestinian journalists since it began on 7 October, 2023.The Committee to Protect Journalists condemned Israel’s “broadcasted killing of journalists in Gaza”. Israel’s military, commenting on the killing of the five journalists on Monday, said that it “does not target journalists as such”.Dagga had not seen her son in a year-and-a-half, after he had been evacuated to the UAE with his father.“She longed to see and embrace her son again. Mariam died with that dream still unfulfilled, to hold her child once more,” Farhan said.To her son Ghaith, Dagga left behind her wishes that he always grow up to fulfil his dreams.“I want you to make me proud to become successful and excel, to prove yourself and to grow into a great businessman, my dear,” she wrote in a letter to her son. “When you grow up, get married and have a daughter, name her Mariam after me.

If that dolphin wanted to drown someone, it could easily do it,” said Sandeman. “Reggie is becoming more boisterous over the weeks. He’s a juvenile, he’s not adult. But he’s around 1,000lbs [454kg]. Over the coming months he will become larger. He will become powerful. He doesn’t really know the harm he could be doing to us in the water.“So he’s definitely not being aggressive. And he’s definitely not a dangerous dolphin. The situation is becoming dangerous, for the swimmers and the dolphin. But he’s not a dangerous dolphin.”The media hype over Reggie, she said, “is the worst scenario I’ve seen for at least 25 years”.View image in fullscreen‘Reggie is still a wild animal and should be treated as such.’Photograph: Marine Management OrganisationPart of the problem is Reggie has become habituated too rapidly, possibly because Lyme Bay is a busy area for swimmers, kayakers and boats. In July, he was spotted with scars from a propeller strike.Sonja Eisfeld-Pierantonio of theWhale and Dolphin Conservationcharity said: “What seems like a friendly bond is actually habituation – the dolphin changing his behaviour to fit a human presence.”In the first three stages of habituation, the dolphin might be seen in a number of locations, then establish itself, choosing a particular buoy or moored vessel to rest. It may start to follow boats, but will maintain a distance from people. It then may become familiar with a small group of people and interact only with them in the water.Then there is stage four, which Reggie is certainly at. As the presence of a dolphin becomes known, and it becomes a local tourist attraction, it will allow physical contact and swim with anyone. Typically, the process can take several months, according to Eisfeld-Pierantonio, “but this individual has reached stage four within a matter of weeks – which is now a cause for serious concern, both for the dolphin and for public safety.”She said: “Although solitary, Reggie is still a wild animal and should be treated as such, not as an opportunity to interact with. These dolphins stop behaving like wild animals, because of humans insisting to interact with them. They might stop feeding naturally, take more risks, and get too close to dangerous situations. Sadly, most solitary sociable dolphins don’t survive long once fully habituated.”Sandeman has seen it before. In the summer of 2018, Danny, a male bottlenose dolphin in Portland, Dorset, was killed by a boat he had become too familiar with. “Time and time and time again, we’re losing solitary sociable dolphins. And no matter how many times we tell the public, they are just not listening, because they see it as a SeaWorld dolphin,” she said.The MMO said it was aware of the recent footage circulating of Reggie being boisterous with swimmers. “Our messaging remains very much the same in that dolphins may at times seem friendly but are unpredictable wild animals. You should never intentionally approach, feed, swim with, or otherwise disturb them.“Human interaction can cause dolphins to lose their natural wariness, leading to injury or even death.Dolphinswhich are repeatedly disturbed by the presence of people are also known to become aggressive over time.“We remind all water users to maintain at least 100 metres’ distance. If a dolphin chooses to approach you, you should in this situation maintain a steady course, leave the area, or simply leave the water.”Explore more on these topicsDolphinsCetaceansMarine lifeWildlifefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Many people are worried they will be unable to continue using the medication, raising concerns for their mental and physical health.For trainee driving instructor Michael, the news is devastating. “I found something that has changed my life and now it’s gone,” says the 52-year-old from Brighton. “The only word that comes to mind is ‘gutted’.”Michael’s starting weight in April was 91.5kg and in just under five months he has lost 16kg and is nearly at his goal weight. Despite being “pretty active”, taking more than 17,000 steps a day, he doesn’t believe that the weight will stay off if he stops taking Mounjaro.“I’ve battled with weight all my life. I’ve lost it in the past but it just comes back. But paying £330 for Mounjaro [after the price rise] is ridiculous. So to lose what’s been like a magic potion for me is a terrible shame.”His plan was to slowly reduce his use of the weight loss drug but he is concerned shortages might prevent this. “I’ve ordered two doses at a higher strength and will buy some extra needles and attempt to ‘guess’ my dose by counting clicks. It’s pushed me into doing what I don’t really want to do, but I don’t feel I have much of a choice.”Like many others, Polly, a retired NHS worker in her 60s from Cardiff, said using Mounjaro has “hugely changed” her life. Not only has she lost almost 25kg, but with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, she’s noticed the weight loss has alleviated her breathing problems. “It was difficult climbing stairs but the difference now is amazing.”But the price rise of Mounjaro, it seems, is prohibitive. “I am stretching myself financially but I can’t anymore,” she says.Paying privately for the weight loss jabs and with about 15kg to lose to be comfortably within her normal weight range, Polly will probably switch to using Wegovy – a cheaper weight loss jab produced by the Danish firm Novo Nordisk. “I daren’t stop,” she says. “I can just about afford Mounjaro now because I am spending less on food and not snacking, but I can’t justify the new cost.”However not everyone is keen to switch, with many readers reporting they are comfortable using Mounjaro and are concerned they may experience new side-effects if they change. In addition, studies have suggested Wegovyis less effective for weight loss.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It’s disappointing,” he says.While he only started using Mounjaro in January after deciding to pay for it privately, he has already lost about 20kg. “I pay £205 a month for the maximum dose of 15mg,” says the retired solicitor from Ware, Hertfordshire. “It’s very expensive but effective.”Christopher, who was looking to continue taking Mounjaro for a few more years, thinks the change in price will make it too much of a “luxury” for him.“I think the way they’ve gone about it is really bad. You’re meant to gradually build up your dose, so to introduce price increases at such short notice will mean people who stop mid course are likely to put weight back on rapidly.“I might switch to a cheaper alternative but I expect I’ll face disappointment once I stop taking Mounjaro.”Explore more on these topicsPharmaceuticals industryObesityHealthfeaturesShareReuse this content"

He explains why he’s battling TikTok – but embracing AIMon 25 Aug 2025 11.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 25 Aug 2025 11.13 EDTShareDarren Aronofsky’s new film is a blast from the past; a half-cut retro tour of late-1990s New York. Beetling around the tatty East Village, casually framing the twin towers downtown, it lifts the lid on a time that has been and gone: when the city was a melting pot of miscreants and misfits, when lowly bar staff could still afford Gotham rents,, and when every car came equipped with a cigarette lighter. “Don’t they have those any more?” says Aronofksy, frowning at his untouched cup of herbal tea. “I don’t know, maybe not. It’s been many years since I smoked a cigarette.”Caught Stealing, he says, could almost be his parallel-universe first movie, given that it’s set in 1998, around the time he was shooting his actual first film, Pi, on the same East Side streets. He was in his late 20s back then, subsisting on pizza and living in a fifth-floor walk-up. He was anxious and ambitious; he had his eyes on the prize. He now thinks he ought to have enjoyed himself more.‘There are probably more jokes in the first 10 minutes of this than in my entire body of work’He’s nostalgic, but so what? It doesn’t mean he’s not right. “The 90s were such a remarkable time, an exciting time to be alive. It was a lot more loose. There was a sense of innocence. The Soviet Union was gone. Climate change wasn’t on 99% of people’s minds and the big scandal was Bill Clinton having an extramarital affair. People were looking forward to the new millennium. It was going to be The Jetsons. It was going to be sci-fi.” The director grins and shakes his head. “We weren’t all living in a state of existential terror.”View image in fullscreen‘I don’t want to shout at clouds’ … Aronofsky.Photograph: Mike Marsland/WireImageAronofsky is now 56 and has spent the bulk of his career on the darker end of the street. His films are a rogues’ gallery of brawlers and bawlers, extending from the sweaty contortions of The Wrestler and Black Swan through to the anguished operatics of Requiem for a Dream and Mother. Super-heavy, he says, super-intense. Except that the world turned so black that he wanted to make something light, or at least lighter than his usual brand of Sturm und Drang. He’s like the film-maker hero fromSullivan’s Travels, Preston Sturges’s Depression-era classic, who belatedly learns the value of entertainment and escapism.“Absolutely,” he says. “Sullivan’s Travels – that’s a huge touchstone for me. But also Hitchcock’s thrillers, Martin Scorsese’sAfter Hours, and a movie like Frantic, with Harrison Ford. I like those films that feature an ordinary hero. The common man who finds himself out of his depth.”In the case of Caught Stealing, that man is Hank Thompson, a baseball whizz turned slacker bartender, nicely embodied byAustin Butler, star of 2022’s Elvis. Hank has a mysterious key to a safe full of loot and various criminal gangs on his tail. The cops are no help and may even be outright crooked. With its hurried setup complete, Caught Stealing proceeds to run wild alongside Manhattan’s riotous 90s fauna, through a neighbourhood of wholesalers and meat-lockers, back yards and dive bars.Matt Smith plays an expat London punk who has to open the sun-roof to accommodate his turmeric-coloured mohawk. Liev Schreiber and Vincent D’Onofrio crop up as orthodox Jewish brothers who lament the shabby state of the city even as they blow holes in it with their shotguns. The film is based on a 2004 novel by Charlie Huston, although Aronofsky says that it was effectively co-written by the city, the locations shaping and changing the action. Fast-paced and punchy, Caught Stealing is a welcome corrective to Aronofsky’s previous picture, The Whale.View image in fullscreenAnguished … Ellen Burstyn in Requiem for a Dream.Photograph: Ronald GrantI’m worrying, though, that we may be slightly mis-selling its tone. The film is violent and bloody and borderline nihilistic. It only looks light compared to the other movies he’s made. “People are calling it a comedy,” he says. “IMDb is calling it a comedy. And I’m like, ‘Really?’ I mean, there’s definitely some laughs. There are probably more jokes in the first 10 minutes of this than in my entire body of work. But a comedy, I don’t know. It’s more a romp, a hoot, a caper. There’s a lot of the Lower East Side in the mix.”If someone invents fire, you don’t say ‘Let’s not mess with it because it might burn down the house’New York still has soul, he insists. At its heart, it’s the same city that he remembers from his youth. It’s the people who’ve changed; nowadays, everyone’s on their phone. That’s the other key reason why he made Caught Stealing: he wanted to create something that was fun enough to lure people back to the cinema. “That’s the mission these days. We’re in a war with meme culture. With TikTok and Instagram stories. People’s attention is no longer on storytelling. But storytelling is so valuable for humanity.”He frowns again at his cup of tea. Its presence seems to irk him. “Here’s the litmus test,” he says. “Every person who reads this article will have a memory of a favourite movie where they can remember exactly where they were when they saw it, and exactly how they felt when that two-hour journey was over. But there is no one who has sat through a two-hour chunk of TikTok who will remember anything about it at all. There is no emotional defining moment. They are two completely different experiences. And yet it’s getting harder and harder to get people to see movies.”View image in fullscreenContortions … Natalie Portman in Black Swan (2010).Photograph: Fox Searchlight/AllstarHe’s hardly alone in his thinking; most big-name directors feel the same. Where he breaks from the script, though, is in his embrace of AI. In May, the director announced the launch of a bespoke new studio, Primordial Soup, in tandem with Google DeepMind. Under the terms of this partnership, Google provides generative AI tools to Aronofsky and his team, while they provide feedback that helps refine and develop the technology. AI more than anything else is viewed as the greatest threat to cinema, so I’m wondering precisely what Aronofksy gets from the deal.“Well, this is the new front in the war on meme culture,” he says. “These tools are coming. They’re being used at an incredible adoption rate, but they’re mostly being used for slop. So I feel that, as storytellers, we need to harness these tools to help us do our work. There are a lot of artists who are fighting against AI, but I don’t see that as making any sense. If we don’t shape these tools, somebody else will.”“You keep calling them tools,” I begin. “They are tools,” he shoots back. But we’re not talking about putting a new paintbrush in the hands of an artist. We’re talking about potentially replacing the artist. “No, no, that’s not happening,” he says, properly vexed by the notion. “People are still going to be making films in the traditional way. But the technology is happening, the tools are happening. So it’s like if someone invents fire. You don’t say, ‘Oh, let’s not mess with this because it might burn down our house.’ There’s never been a technology that shows up that people aren’t going to use.”View image in fullscreen‘An exciting time to be alive’ … Butler with Zoe Kravitz in Caught Stealing.Photograph: Niko TaverniseIt was fear of an unchained, omnivorousAI that prompted the 2023 writers and actors’ strike in Hollywood. So I’m assuming Aronofsky’s position makes him a rarity among his peers. “Yeah, publicly I am,” he admits. “But I’ve been in touch with so many people who are deeply curious. And again: it’s already happening. There’s a generation of young people already playing with these tools. So we’re going to see new types of images and a lot of content that’s different – that’s not just mimicking other movies but is really doing something new.”We’ve been talking over tea for a little under an hour. We started in grungy 1990s New York; we’re ending up in the future, in the brave new sci-fi world. Despite all the dangers, that’s probably the right trajectory. The past can be golden, but it can also be a trap.“I don’t want to be one of those old men shouting at clouds,” he says. “Or shouting at the TV set, ‘Elvis Presley’s moving his hips and he needs to be banned.’ The world is changing. I’m trying to lean into the excitement. It’s time to shut up, stop complaining and dance.”Caught Stealing is out in the UK on 29 AugustExplore more on these topicsDarren AronofskyAustin ButlerMatt SmithCrime filmsComedy filmsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

They are then stranded on a tropical island dressed only in their wedding outfit for a three-week honeymoon without phones, luxuries, family or friends.The idyllic looking island becomes a metaphor for marriage, as the reality of their situation – given basic rations and surrounded by insects – becomes apparent.While the show’s premise could be described as Love Island for older people crossed with First Dates crossed with Survivor, McCall says it is a “real” reality series that the producers “can’t steer” or predict.‘A sheer delight to watch’: the 20 most lovable people on British televisionRead moreShe said: “We’ll all learn something from it. It’s brilliant. It’s really tough, but it’s also amazingly helpful for moving forward with your life. I think anybody watching it is going to take a lot away from it.“It was a brilliant kind of social experiment, looking at people meeting in the toughest of conditions and seeing if love can flourish … it is a way of getting to know somebody very, very well, very quickly.”View image in fullscreenThe show features 12 people looking for love who are matched with someone then stranded on a tropical island for three weeks without any luxuries.Photograph: BBC/CPL ProductionsThe presenter said the show’s format meant “leaving the distractions” of modern life behind so people could show their true characters, work ethic and resilience faster than if they met via online dating.She also said the show was about “being stripped of everything,” which is anathema in a consumer culture used to social media, grooming products and filters.For one contestant who likes lipstick and doing her hair, “it was really difficult” because without those things “she could feel herself losing something of herself”. McCall said it was interesting to observe how her partner reacted.“It’s such a learning curve for everyone. Being out there, you are stripped of everything that makes you you and also makes you feel comfortable and safe or attractive. It’s a very, very difficult experience, especially when you’re with someone you don’t know at all.“These are big things that normally don’t happen for months. It’s the quickest induction into someone’s life and personality and who they are. If you can survive that, I feel like you can survive anything.”McCall said the Stranded participants “genuinely really want to meet someone – and it is difficult nowadays”. A point echoed by one contestant, Helen, who said she took part as she was tired of “the endless swiping” on dating apps.At a screening of Stranded in London, McCall said she agreed to front the series – which airs on BBC1 and iPlayer this autumn – after an operation toremove a benign brain tumourwhich, she confirmed, “is not coming back”.View image in fullscreen‘I love love’: Davina McCall said the participants on the show ‘genuinely really want to meet someone’.Photograph: Ian West/PAHowever, she said: ”It’s changed me, in a way … it’s made me want to absolutely live life to the max and grow old disgracefully and do everything I wanted to do. Because I do understand that, in life, you don’t know what’s around the corner.“What I love about this [show] is they’re all slightly at this point where they’re like: ‘I will do anything to find love; I’m hitting that stage of my life and I’m really ready to meet somebody and settle down.’“And they’ve taken a massive leap of faith. And I guess me having this operation was sort of very conducive to me accepting this show, because it felt quite like an adventure. And I do love love [and] being able to help people find that.”With the fashion for turning TV series,such as The Traitors, into live experiences, there is speculation that Stranded, created by the Scandinavian company Snowman Productions, could become a real-life singles dating holiday.Explore more on these topicsReality TVDavina McCallTelevisionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Despite repeated warnings of a growing number of predators taking advantage of it, Tor’s developers have taken no action to curb the spread of this content, critics say.The Tor (“the onion router”) network is an anonymity-focused internet system that routes traffic through a global web of volunteer-run servers to obscure users’ identities and locations. By encrypting data in multiple layers – like that of an onion – Tor makes digital activity difficult to trace.This privacy architecture, experts warn, has created a safe haven for child predators. The platform’s design makes it virtually impossible to remove harmful posts or illegal content, they say, and the organization behind Tor has resisted pressure to implement even basic safeguards.The Canadian Centre for Child Protection (C3P) told the Guardian it had submitted more than 19,000 notifications to the Tor Project – the privacy-focused US non-profit that develops and maintains the network – flagging child sexual abuse material (CSAM) detected on its system. Yet the organization has taken no action, according to C3P.“Tor is designed in a way such that they can’t remove anything and they refuse to change it, because the idea of any sort of censorship on there is bad,” said Lloyd Richardson, C3P’s director of technology. “Tor has a board of directors that makes decisions surrounding this, and I don’t think they’ve ever been held to account for any of this. They’re the only people who can essentially intervene, and they refuse to do so.”The Tor Project offers two primary tools designed to enhance online anonymity. The first is the Tor browser, which routes internet traffic on the regular web through a network of volunteer-run servers, effectively masking a user’s location and activity. This process functions similarly to a virtual private network by concealing identifying information.The second, the onion services (formerly known as hidden services), are websites or services hosted within the Tor network, accessible only via .onion addresses. These provide both user and server anonymity. Onion services websites operate exclusively within the Tor network. Their specialized .onion domain allows them to remain concealed from traditional search engines and standard internet access. Neither of Tor’s products has systems to detect, moderate or report CSAM, or mechanisms for processing user-generated content in the way mainstream social networks do.To connect to a hidden service, both the user and the service create separate encrypted paths that meet at a randomly selected rendezvous point. This process involves at least three relays or “nodes” operated by anonymous volunteer entities and individuals around the world, keeping both IP addresses hidden from each other, and makes it exceptionally difficult to trace the user’s activity or location.More users find their way to the dark webWhile using Tor onion services requires more technical expertise than the regular web, recent advancements in its usability are driving an increase in the number of predators active there by lowering the barrier of entry, said experts interviewed.Mainstream social media platforms like Reddit, Telegram and Discord have become informal entry points to the dark web, playing a central role in guiding users on to the Tor network. These platforms host discussions about accessing Tor, which include step-by-step guides, marketplace directories, safety tips and .onion links to illicit content.Now, individuals are often introduced to Tor through social media chats that promise more extreme or explicit content, lowering the barrier to entry for child predators and other offenders, said a federal prosecutor, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.“I’ve had cases where people have started on traditional social media platforms and someone will say to them something along the lines of: ‘If you want to see my real stuff, here’s a link to my thing,’” said the prosecutor. “That is often how that happens and how you get people getting on the dark web or accessing things that they don’t traditionally have access to or wouldn’t access without prompting.”Child predators are drawn to using Tor because they do not need to conceal their activities, already being afforded anonymity by the browser, said Dan Sexton, chief technology officer at the Internet Watch Foundation, a UK-based non-profit that focuses on preventing online child abuse.View image in fullscreenDan Sexton, chief technology officer at the Internet Watch Foundation.Photograph: Graeme Robertson/The Guardian“They know that there are law enforcement and other people monitoring these sites,” said Sexton. “Yet they just do it in plain sight because the anonymity gives them that level of protection, and that feeling like they can’t be found, they can’t be caught, so it’s low risk in that respect.”The predators active in these forums form welcoming communities on Tor’s network, where they compliment and encourage one another in a way that they don’t do elsewhere online, experts say.The Guardian has reviewed excerpts of discussion threads in which users share tips on how to target, groom and abuse very young children. These dark web forums, accessed via Tor, are estimated to have hundreds of thousands of users by C3P. These excerpts were uncovered this year by investigators at the C3P and shared with law enforcement. The material was redacted to remove any information that could identify a victim before it was passed to the Guardian.According to experts, these anonymous communities normalise child abuse, making it more likely that participants will go on to commit contact offenses against children they can access in real life.“People will say ‘this particular victim is what has made me want to violate my own daughter’ and things like that,” said Richardson of C3P. “There’s definitely, by their own admission, this sort of escalation, and they egg each other on in these communities.”A study published byNaturelast year determined that CSAM is easily available using 21 out of the 26 most-used Tor search engines, and that at least 11% of users’ searches seek CSAM. Research published in the Journal of Online Trust and Safety indicatesthat more than 40%of dark web users accessing CSAM go on to seek contact with children with the aim of pursuing sexual acts.A spokesperson for the Tor Project said in a statement it was “deeply troubled by the fact that a small fraction of internet users exploit Tor for illicit purposes, and we strongly condemn the misuse of Tor technology for any illicit use cases, especially child sexual abuse material (CSAM). As an organization dedicated to advancing human rights and strengthening online privacy protections, we recognize the legitimate concerns raised by child protection organizations and experts.”The Tor Project receives funding from a number of backers including the US Department of State, the Swedish government’s international development agency (Sida), the Open Society Foundations, Craig Newmark Philanthropies, theFord Foundationand Twitter founder Jack Dorsey’s philanthropic initiative #StartSmall.Tor’s services have long served as an important tool for protecting online anonymity, enabling free expression and access to information under repressive regimes. Amnesty International has recognized Tor’s contribution to advancing human rights by shielding users from unlawful surveillance and censorship. The ACLU has similarly advocated for its use, urging government websites to inform users of anonymous browsing options, particularly for reporting sensitive information.Tor’s anonymity protections have been crucial for whistleblowers and dissidents. Edward Snowden used Tails, an operating system that routes traffic through Tor, to leak NSA documents anonymously in 2013. During Iran’s 2009 protests, activists relied on Tor to bypass state censorship and coordinate securely with the outside world. The Guardian has also made aversion of its websiteavailable to Tor users as an onion service.However, critics argue that Tor’s benefits should not come at the cost of enabling the distribution of CSAM.“Trading content of children being sexually abused is not protected free expression. It’s a felony,” said Gretchen Peters, founder and executive director of the Alliance to Counter Crime Online (ACCO), a non-profit focused on combating serious online crimes. “Why are US government organizations like the state department continuing to fund the Tor Project, while this problem continues to be so severe?”The US state department did not respond to comment requests.A spokesperson for the Tor Project told the Guardian that introducing mechanisms to monitor or block content on Tor would undermine privacy and security protections that millions of legitimate users rely upon.“Tor is not creating the bad sites – it’s creating the unregulated superhighway that people traverse. It’s willful blindness,” said the prosecutor interviewed. “Child sexual abuse material makes up a significant portion of content hosted on dark web sites.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Tor is not considered an ESP since it is engineered for privacy and anonymity, routing internet traffic to conceal user identities rather than hosting or moderating content.These sites operate entirely within the network using .onion addresses.Yet, well-intentioned volunteer node operators may unknowingly contribute to the transmission of harmful content, including the circulation of CSAM and the operation of pedophile networks, experts said.“People who join the Tor network have no opportunity to opt out of the CSAM trade. You support all of Tor when you become a relay or none of it,” said Brian Levine, associate dean of IT and facilities and distinguished professor at University of Massachusetts Amherst.Tor is also not impenetrable to other forms of hacking: the FBI has deployed malware to infiltrate child abuse images sites hosted by Tor, which has uncovered thousands of real IP addresses of users visiting the sites.Millions of pedophilesLaw enforcement agencies around the world have undertaken several high-profile takedowns of large pedophile forums that have revealed the potential scale and organization of these networks.Kidflix, one of the largest-known paedophile sites in the world, was dismantled by international law enforcement earlier this year in an operation involving authorities from more than 35 countries. The platform, which was hosted on Tor, had attracted 1.8 million users globally between April 2022 and March 2025, according to German law enforcement. On 11 March 2025, German and Dutch authorities seized the server, which at the time held approximately 72,000 CSAM videos.Another platform on Tor named Childs Play, boasted a million users when it was in operation between 2016 and 2017, Australian police said after theirsting operationbrought it down.Shutting one site down rarely ends the problem, as predators can easily migrate to another site on the service, experts say. C3P actively monitors and scrapes information from several pedophile sites on Tor, and the larger sites have estimated user bases of between 300,000 and 600,000 each, said Richardson.“It’s created this system where law enforcement takes something down,” said Levine. “It all gets rebuilt back up by a single person who may get caught in the future, but there’s always more of these individuals lining up to start up the next forum that’s carrying the knowledge forward.”The experts interviewed urged Tor to act to remove CSAM from its sites and stem the formation of pedophile groups.“The notion that just because the web addresses aren’t searchable by the surface web doesn’t mean that the administrators of Tor can’t find wrongdoing that is going on in their systems and remove it and report it to authorities,” said Peters, of ACCO.The concern, experts warn, is that while the technique can clearly be applied to illegal material, there is no easy way to draw the line that prevents it from being used more broadly.“Some kind of content moderation is needed. We just haven’t yet figured out how to do it in a way that is scalable,” said Juha Nurmi, cybersecurity expert and postdoctoral research fellow atTampere University in Finland. “It could be done so multiple parties need to use their private keys to make filtering decisions for a certain website, and these are across multiple countries. It could be a way to handle it so we don’t have a central power making decisions.”A spokesperson for the Tor Project said: “The Tor Project collaborates with organizations dedicated to combating the tech-enabled distribution of CSAM by leveraging Tor technology to reach individuals struggling with harmful behaviors and offering them pathways to treatment through private, secure channels.”C3P said its data shows that treatment programs for pedophiles are an ineffective approach to curbing offender behaviour on Tor’s onion services. This is in part because these users aren’t part of the pedophile population seeking help.“Our data indicates that these forums continue to grow in size, and the trade of CSAM made possible by the Tor Project has only increased,” said C3P’s Richardson.In a statement to the Guardian, the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (Sida) said its funding of Tor is earmarked for the training and capacity-building of human rights defenders, abuse survivors, journalists and reporters in need of protection and privacy“Sida is in frequent contact with Tor’s leadership. In this specific case, we have also reached out to them to confirm their engagement and are following this matter closely,” said a Sida spokesperson.Open Society Foundation said it made a grant to Tor to support the ability of human rights defenders to maintain secure and confidential communications, and the grant has since ended.“We are alarmed to learn of these allegations, and we will be conducting a review of this grant,” said a spokesperson for the organization. “We always expect our grantees to comply with their legal obligations and to uphold human rights principles.”In the US, call or text theChildhelpabuse hotline on 800-422-4453 or visittheir websitefor more resources and to report child abuse or DM for help.

That everything has a cost, even if not financial. But I’m at my local Neighbourhood House, one of many community centres found across Australia, breaking bread with strangers and eating a genuinely free lunch. While it cost me time, what I’ve gained feels socially priceless: I’m getting to know my neighbours, something fewer and fewer Australians are doing.In 2000, Robert Putnam’s book Bowling Alonewarned of declining civic participation and social connection in US society. Americans, he argued, were retreating from clubs, associations and volunteer groups – the building blocks of community connection – in favour of a more solitary existence. As Putnam put it at the time: “We used to bowl in leagues; now we bowl alone.”Although the prognosis was American, the symptoms were being felt in Australia too. Fast forward 25 years and they are even more pronounced. Australians are attending fewercommunity activities,volunteering lessand have less trust in institutions and democracy. Political polarisation is on the up, whileunionand political party membership is down.The personal impacts are clear. Social isolation is now considered one of the greatest health risks to Australian society and nearlyone in threepeople report being lonely. As Hugh Mackay, social psychologist and honorary professor at Australian National University, puts it: “We are born to connect, but lonelier than ever.”Alone but not lonely: the solo activities that help foster connectionRead moreThat’s not to say that Australians are not active members of their communities: the country enjoys some of thehighest civic participation scores worldwide, helped by compulsory voting. But Australians invest in community with less frequency and vigour and, should the trend continue, it could have profound implications for our wellbeing, society and democracy.Our desire for connection has not disappeared. Peruse your preferred choice of media – newspaper, TikTok or TV panel show – and you’ll no doubt come across someone opining the loss of community. We have an unmet social hunger – or perhaps we’re looking in the wrong places. So, how does one reconnect with their community in 2025?My first stop is the social activitydu jourin 2025: a running club. It’s relatively easy to sign up, though forcing myself out of bed at 7.30am on a Saturday is a harder sell. Once I arrive, I’m greeted with a warm round of applause as a newcomer. It’s disarming how friendly people are: there’s no pressure, no networking agenda, just a low-stakes friendliness that feels increasingly rare.Next, I enrol in a 10-week improvised comedy course. There’s a fee, so it’s not accessible to everyone, but it comes with its own kind of social benefit. Lesson one makes clear: being awkward is part of the process. I’m going to need to get used to that.So far, so good. For my next endeavour I turn to Dr Laurie Santos, professor of psychology at Yale University, for advice. Her class, Psychology and the Good Life, became the most popular course in Yale’s history when it launched in 2018. It focuses on something that statistics suggest eludes many of us: genuine happiness.Santos says having a strong social connection is correlated with lower levels of stress, reduced risk of chronic disease and longer life expectancy. To see the greatest benefits, one should pick activities that are intentional and involve supporting others.Participation takes planning, but the joy comes from presence“Activities like volunteering at a local shelter, mentoring someone, or even organising community events can allow you to connect with others and give you a sense of purpose,” she says. “To make sure you’re getting the biggest happiness boost, try to find prosocial activities that allow you to see the positive effect of your actions on other people.”Judith Dickson is now retired but has been volunteering since she was 18. Over the years she has been involved in many different forms of community organising, including sports, social justice and gardening.“The most important thing I’ve learned is I’m not alone,” Dickson says. “It will help you feel useful and you’ll become connected to a wider community.”Beyond the personal impact, it has opened her up to other points of view. “I’ve met so many fabulous, interesting people and I’ve learned to see the world in different ways,” she says. “You forget what’s going on in your own life, you’re all working toward a shared goal.”View image in fullscreenAs Dickson demonstrates, volunteering and other prosocial activities are important precisely because they are collective. Increasing individualism is one of the greatest risks to community, says Mackay, and reversing this is central to increasing social cohesion.“There’s increasing concern about ‘my rights, my entitlements’ – be that gender, ethnicity, religion, politics, culture,” Mackay says. These are important, he says, but far less important than what we have in common: our shared humanity. “In a fire or flood you don’t ask how someone voted in the [Indigenous] voice referendum – you just help.”In my own search for volunteering, I turn to the internet. What I find is disheartening: most volunteering opportunities involve lengthy forms, interviews and police background checks.When did trying to do good become so bureaucratic? I try short-circuiting the process by rocking up to my local op-shop and offering my time. I’m met with great enthusiasm – and quickly think to myself that this a great example of why in-person interaction is beneficial – only to be referred online to fill out another form.‘Looking after the oldies’: when Meals on Wheels lost half its workforce, young Australians stepped inRead moreMark Pearce, the chief executive ofVolunteeringAustralia, says my experience is far from unique. He acknowledges the need for proper checks but says the growing administrative burden puts many people off.“We talk about volunteering as for the common good and without financial gain but it doesn’t always come free and oftentimes costs the volunteer,” he says. “Things like those regulatory burdens impact on people’s proclivity to volunteer through organisations.”Pearce says the increase in admin has – along with other factors – resulted in a rise of “informal volunteering”, where communities come together to tackle an issue without an institution or organisation. He says as many as 6 million Australians partake in this type of activity.But even to find that you have to know what you’re looking for and then seek out the right portal: a Facebook page, an Instagram profile or a MeetUp group. These spaces are often gatekept – you must request to join groups – and can be difficult to find. Googling “community events” does not, it turns out, bear fruit. It’s a paradox that the technologies which are blamed for eroding social ties are the ones we have to use to help rebuild them.Perhaps I’m falling into a trap: an expectation that, just like a takeaway order or parcel delivery arriving as and when I want it, community can be found online without friction or effort.Unlike many her age, Niamh Murray, 31, is an avid communitarian. She actively seeks out connection in various forms, which she calls “medicine”.“So often I’m sitting at home alone, feeling so isolated and like there’s so much disagreement in the world,” she says of her own doom-scrolling habits. “But when you come into community spaces you realise that there are so many more people who feel the same as you, who are lost and lonely, want more meaning in their life and want to make the world a better place.”The interactions she has through her community work are an antidote to the toxicity of the internet, she says.View image in fullscreenDespite Murray’s enthusiasm, my desire to attend running club and improv wanes as the burden of the search takes hold. But then around week four something starts to happen: I keep turning up consistently and the connections I’ve made blossom. I get offered lifts home, invited to other events and, through improv, I volunteer for Melbourne international comedy festival, opening up a whole new network of connections.I’m beginning to experience the benefits of what Putnam would term “reciprocity”. When you give without expectation of immediate return, it will come back to you later down the line. Reciprocity is the soil in which community connection grows. With this comes a sense of conviviality – I actively want to help others, to pay forward the social generosity shown to me.But so far my focus has been limited. My running club and improv are made up of people who look like me and, mostly, share my educational background. “The real secret for building social cohesion is not that we hang out with people like us, it’s that we’re prepared to hang out with people not like us,” Mackay reminds me. “We succeed when we invite the people next door in for a cup of tea, not for any reason other thanbecausethey’re neighbours.”The secrets of self-optimisers: why ‘microefficiencies’ are on the riseRead moreEven with my newfound positivity, once I start noticing a dearth of community more generally, it feels confronting. Although having a friendly chat with someone while queueing for a coffee is nourishing – and studies show these “weak tie” kinds of interactions are just as important as friendships – I become frustrated with the fleeting nature of these moments. I find myself longing for what is probably a rose-tinted view of the past: a town square full of activity and socialising, where you could just turn up and be with others.In 2025 – at least in Melbourne – a friendly town square is hard to come by. So I try the next best thing: my local library. There I’m presented with a range of potential events I could join: reading groups, community gardening and walking societies.Just as with volunteering, choosing a community from a list feels somewhat sanitised, another example of the individualistic and consumerist creep into our everyday lives, rather than something that occurs organically. The tendency to treat community building as another thing to schedule into an already busy,optimisedandcuratedexistence feels at odds with what Mackay and Santos have told me. Community should feel natural and altruistic. Perhaps this is why informal volunteering is on the rise.But I reason that it takes work to get there, so I opt to try Neighbourhood House, which hosts free community events in centres around the country. I start attending their lunches and meet a range of people I can confidently say I would never have spoken to otherwise.At the same time, I come across an advertisement for a “language exchange” in my local newspaper (proof of local media’s value to community) and decide to go along. It’s in Melbourne’s city centre and the crowd is, from what I can tell, almost all new migrants. This is an important addition: the demographics of Australia have changed significantly in the past 25 years and, for the first time since colonisation, nearly a third of the population were not born here, up from 23% at the turn of the century. Although I’m a fairly new migrant myself, my experience as a white British man is different to many others, and most of my social circle were born in Australia. If I’m to create a truly representative community, I need to mix with people who weren’t.View image in fullscreenThe Neighbourhood House lunch and the language exchange are somewhat more difficult than my previous attempts to connect: conversations are slower, common ground is harder to find and, on the whole, it feels less immediately satisfying. But buoyed up by the social boost from my other experiences, I push through. Slowly, my sense of community shifts. I feel less like an outsider and more like part of a whole.I am both energised and exhausted but I definitely feel better for it. It can be awkward, boring and, at times, testing: participation takes planning, but the joy comes from presence. Social friction isn’t avoidable if you want to be a good communitarian – it’s necessary.“Anyone can be nice to their friends,” Mackay says. “The challenge to social cohesion, to creating truly harmonious societies, is that we extend that to everyone. The state of the nation starts in your street.”Explore more on these topicsFriendshipSelf and wellbeingAustralian lifestyleVolunteeringVoluntary sectorHobbiesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

After 35 years of traveling to the United States, he says he no longer feels safe making the trip.“The fact that we’re being evaluated for our opinions entering a country that, at least until very recently, purported to be an example of democracy. Yeah, these are things that make me highly uncomfortable,” said Serry, aCanadianperformer and attorney.“You’re left thinking that you don’t want to leave evidence of ‘bad opinions’ on your person.”Serry is among a substantial cohort of foreign nationals reconsidering travel to the US under theTrump administration, after troubling reports of visitors facing intense scrutiny and detention on arrival.In March, a French scientist who had been critical of Donald Trump wasrefused entryto the US after his phone was searched. An Australian writer who was detained and denied entry in Junesaidhe was initially grilled about his articles on pro-Palestinian protests, and then watched as a border agent probed even the most personal images on his phone. He was told the search uncovered evidence of past drug use, which he had not acknowledged on his visa waiver application, leading to his rejection. German, British and other European tourists have also been detained and sent home.How to protect your phone and data privacy at the US borderRead moreMore than a dozen countries have updated their travel guidance to the US. In Australia and Canada, government advisories were changed to specifically mention the potential for electronic device searches.On theadviceof various experts, people are locking down social media, deleting photos and private messages, removing facial recognition, or even traveling with “burner” phones to protect themselves.In Canada, multiple public institutions have urged employees to avoid travel to the US, and at least onereportedlytold staff to leave their usual devices at home and bring a second device with limited personal information instead.“Everybody feels guilty, but they don’t know exactly what they’re guilty of,” said Heather Segal, founding partner of Segal Immigration Law in Toronto, describing the influx of concerns she’s been hearing.“‘Did I do something wrong? Is there something on me? Did I say something that’s going to be a problem?’”She advised travelers to assess their risk appetite by reviewing both the private data stored on their devices and any information about them that’s publicly accessible, and to consider what measures to take accordingly.US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) has broad powers to search devices with minimal justification. Travelers can refuse to comply, but non-citizens risk being denied entry.CBP datashows such searches are rare; last year, just over 47,000 out of 420 million international travelers had their devices examined. This year’s figures show a significant increase, with the third quarter of 2025 reflecting an uptick in electronic device searches higher than any single quarter since 2018, when available data begins.“Anecdotally, it seems like these searches have been increasing, and I think the reason why that’s true is, undoubtedly, I think they are more targeted than before,” said Tom McBrien, counsel at the Electronic Privacy Information Center.“It seems like they are targeting people who they just don’t generally like politically.”Travelers who are concerned about their privacy should consider minimizing the amount of data they carry, McBrien said.“The less data you have on you, the less there is to search, and the less there is to collect,” he said. Beyond using a secondary device, he suggested securely deleting data, moving it to a hard drive or storing it in a password-protected cloud account.A Department of Homeland Security (DHS) spokesperson rejected claims that CBP had stepped up device searches under the new administration or singled out travelers over their political views.“These searches are conducted to detect digital contraband, terrorism-related content, and information relevant to visitor admissibility, all of which play a critical role in national security,” the spokesperson told the Guardian in a statement.“Allegations that political beliefs trigger inspections or removals are baseless and irresponsible.”The statement acknowledged, however, that there had been heightened vetting under Trump and the homeland security secretary, Kristi Noem.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

People should think seriously before booking travel, especially if they are journalists or writers or activists.”Various foreign nationals told the Guardian they are rethinking travel plans for tourism, family visits, academic events and work.Donald Rothwell, a professor who teaches international law at the Australian National University, says he no longer plans to accept speaking invitations to the US over fears of being detained or denied entry – which, he noted, could also trigger red flags on his record for future travel.He’s even considered traveling without a device at all, but is concerned his academic commentary in the media could be used against him regardless.“I might be commenting on matters that could be quite critical of the United States,” he said. “For example, I was very critical of the legal or lack of legal justification for the US military strikes on Iran in June.”Kate, a Canadian whose name has been withheld due to privacy concerns, said she has wrestled with complicated decisions about whether to travel across the border to see American relatives, including for an upcoming wedding. During a trip earlier this year, she deleted her social media apps before going through customs.Despite DHS assurances that travelers are not flagged for political beliefs, she said “it’s hard to believe things that this government is saying”.“It would be really nice to have trust that those kinds of things were true, and that these kinds of stories that you hear, while absolutely horrific, are isolated incidents,” she said.“But I do feel like in many ways, the United States has sort of lost its goodwill.”This article was amended on 25 August 2025. An earlier version said CBP data showed there was no significant increase in device checks for travelers at the border; however, figures from the third quarter of 2025 are the highest recorded since 2018, when available data begins.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationUS immigrationDonald TrumpUS constitution and civil libertiesGazaPalestinian territoriesUS universitiesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

On Saturday,thousands of peoplegathered in Habima Square in central Tel Aviv to demand an end to the war – one of the largest rallies since the fighting broke out. Israeli police revoked a prior permit for a march through the city, in a clear attempt to silence our voices of opposition – but we refused to let them succeed. It had been 24 hours since the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC)declared a faminein Gaza and revealed the horrors of Israel’s full-scale starvation campaign. Many Israelis felt it was our duty to rally in the streets.Since the cabinet resolution to reoccupy Gaza City, the Israeli military has issued 60,000 new recruitment warrants for reserve service. When the warrants come into effect in early September, the reserve forces will be at their highest level since the outbreak of the war – 130,000. But the military is not the only thing increasing in size. So, too, is the refusal movement.In recent weeks, a surge of refusers emerged in response to the political cynicism of Benjamin Netanyahu. In private talks between family members or in public declarations of objection, more and more Israelis are realising that participating in military service is to be complicit with the government’s crimes. The movement is not homogenous – either in age and social grouping, or in motive or ideology. Some conscientious objectors, like the teenagers of Mesarvot,go public with their refusalto be part of the war machine. They are treated with extreme severity and often subjected to cycles of imprisonment in military jail. I have personally conducted regulatory visits at such facilities, meeting these brave people who have come to be known as “soldiers of peace”.Others are less willing to publicise their stance, but privately refuse to serve. The data on the exact number of “grey refusers” is treated as a top intelligence secret and is not shared by the military, butYesh Gvul, an organisation that assists those called up to obtain draft exemptions, says their number is constantly increasing. A recent poll published in Haaretz showed a striking increase in public support for those refusing to be drafted – about33% of Jewish Israelisbelieve it is not only justified, but necessary, to save the hostages from the dangers of the military campaign in Gaza City. Motives for refusal range from resisting the genocide, moral objections to participating in war crimes, political opposition to the occupation at large and concern that military action endangers the hostages to disapproval of the ultra-Orthodox community’s exemption from service.Ella Keidar Greenberg, a conscientious objector who spoke at Saturday’s rally after being held in solitary confinement throughout April, said that by refusing she was able to obstruct the continuing destruction. While they are still speaking from a marginal position, it is clear that more and more Israelis wish to frustrate the government. In recent months, more demonstrations, vigils and direct action against Netanyahu’s war have been taking place.United by the basic notion of humanity, thousands of Arabs and Jews joined one another on Saturday to protest against the starvation, slaughter and carnage. Protesters held up pictures of the starved and bombed children ofGaza, knowing that the culprit responsible for their torment is still in power. We urged the release of all hostages and unlawful captives – Israelis and Palestinians alike – in a political agreement that would see the Israeli government pulling all military forces out of Gaza.1:33Israel protests erupt nationwide to demand end of Gaza war – videoBut in the wake of news of another round of bombardments in Gaza, our message from the rally is best understood from the banner: “Never again”. Never again will we allow silence to prevail in the face of slaughtered children and starved families. Never again will we look on quietly as Netanyahu orders the destruction of neighbourhoods and the invasion of hospitals. Never again will we let his government refuse an agreement that will release the hostages. Never again will the Gaza genocide unfold quietly.As the descendant of a Jewish family from Poland, the words “never again” have significant meaning for me. In the aftermath of the second world war, humankind vowed to never again allow such atrocities to occur. The Holocaust, the mass extermination of the Jewish people, plumbed the very depths of tyrannical evil. Precisely because of this heritage, I view “never again” as a universal imperative.In 1948, the international community adopted the universal declaration of human rights and the convention on the prevention and punishment of the crime of genocide. In the decades since, we have failed globally many times to safeguard this invaluable truth: that people must not perish in flames, and such heinous crimes must not be perpetrated while outsiders stand idly by. But never in recent times have people around the world stared into the abyss of annihilation as we are doing today in Gaza. As such, “never again” is not merely a moral reminder but an ethical decree to act.As Netanyahu starves Gaza, there is a whole new battle to be fought in Israel – against complacency | Aluf BennRead moreFool me once, shame on you, fool me twice, shame on me, as the saying goes. It seems that Netanyahu manages to fool western leaders time and time again. On Friday, in response to the IPC declaration of famine, the UK foreign secretary, David Lammy, said it was an “utterly horrifying and wholly preventable man-made catastrophe”. May I ask Lammy and the rest of the British cabinet – are you among the people responsible for this catastrophe? In July, the UK prime minister, Keir Starmer,announced a conditional planto recognise a Palestinian state if Israel did not change course.Starving people who are under constant threat of bombardment do not enjoy the same patience as suited officials in marble offices. They plead for food, water and air while politicians debate conditions and timing.Starmer must immediately recognise Palestine unconditionally, but he must recognise much more than that. He must acknowledge Netanyahu as the international war criminal that he is. He must support new sanctions to tackle the settler movement, including ministers such as Itamar Ben-Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich. He must recognise that Netanyahu and his government are the main obstacle to releasing the hostages. He must recognise the people of Gaza as victims of a continuing genocide, and act accordingly. Or he will remain complicit in this devastating, human-made catastrophe.Dr Ofer Cassif is a member of the Knesset, representing the Democratic Front for Peace and Equality (Hadash) since 2019Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

But wait till their expensive kit is mired in mud, the blazer takes on a flammable sheen and the PE kit stinks up the houseMon 25 Aug 2025 12.18 EDTLast modified on Mon 25 Aug 2025 13.34 EDTShareThe first time you put your kid in school uniform, there’s an intoxicating charm to the moment. There he is, your precious firstborn, and you’ve dressed him up like a grown-assed man who’s managing the fanciest restaurant on a very large ferry. Slacks and a well-pressed shirt are just the baseline; there’s also insignia on everything – jumpers, shorts, bags, pencil cases and water bottles – and the crest is something egalitarian, such as a tree or a leaf, but whatever it is, only that will do. After a full and overall pretty happy life of not sweating the small stuff, suddenly there’s a person in your house whose every clothing item is absolutely irreplaceable, and that person is four, and has squashed a beetle into it. On that first day, though, all you’re thinking is, “How adorable, this is like his first Christmas, when we dressed him up as a pudding.” The next 12 years, though, are going to be hell.The first year, you’ll spend the whole time looking for the insignia jumper.The second year, you’ll just give in and buy five jumpers, 10 shirts, and five pairs of trousers, and a year two trouser pair will remain in circulation until the end of time, waiting to bite you in year 11, when they can’t get those trousers on, and it’s all they have, and they’re on their way to a GCSE.The third year, you’ll start a campaign at the PTA to get rid of school uniform, but then you’ll have to leave the campaign because you didn’t like any of the other parents and, like any political journey, this will cause you to overshoot.So it’s now year four, and you’re the world’s most fervent advocate for school uniform, even though the proportions of this swindle have now fully revealed themselves to you:not only is it expensive, it can also be very poor quality and you have tons of it. Every time you get an email from School Uniform Direct, you half want to take them up on their sale offer (6% off, 17th tie free) and half want to report them to the Financial Services Ombudsman.Year five is pretty quiet and then, in year six, on their last day at primary school, they destroy their uniform by writing all over it with amarker pen and ripping it, and this enrages you, because you wanted to destroy it yourself.Ah, the seventh year: all the children have now been promoted from the ferry to a golf course, which is to say, they have a blazer, and for precisely one week this looks like an item of clothing, after which time it takes on a mysterious sheen that looks extremely flammable. You just have to hope they don’t start smoking.In year eight, things will get much easier for you if you took the precaution of only having sons, because the conversations you will have with daughters are just dispiriting. Of course they’re not warm enough, they’retights. They’re either itchy or they’re not warm enough. That’s what being femaleis.We should all be eating 30 different plants a week. I can’t even name that many | Zoe WilliamsRead moreThe ninth year, they discover self-consciousness. Realistically, they discovered it ages ago, but you chose not to engage and they didn’t push it because they were in their polite era. Now they need shorts underneath their skirts, in case anyone realises they have pants on, and a vest underneath their shirt in case anyone realises they have nipples despite being a boy, and all these garments interact in subtly different ways, despite being identical, sometimes creating enough static to give you a full electric shock if they ever hug you which, praise be, they will not. It turns out the argument, “It’s not that you look dreadful, it’s that box pleats don’t suit anyone,” isn’t the slam dunk you thought.By year 10, only one pair of trousers exists that are long enough, nobody knows where they came from, they cannot be duplicated, they have to be cherished, and your kid cherishes them by rolling in mud and then sitting on a Capri-Sun. Every day. They would rather be in Squid Game than do PE, because of the joggers, and there’s a lot to fault in the joggers, fashion-wise, but nothing smells as bad as the tops.Suddenly, it’s the eleventh year, and they’re on their way to their final exam, wearing the last shirt standing, which has a stain on it that looks a lot like blood, nobody knows whose, and their year two trousers as a bandana. Treasure those early years, they say; you’ll miss them when they’ve passed. Trust me, you won’t miss this.Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on theissuesraised in this article?

The endorsement of new, unnatural voters –Latinosin the US for Donald Trump, or Tories voting for Labour for thefirst time– might deliver big electoral swings but is ultimately not sticky. And these votes are only meaningful if the bedrock is solid. That bedrock is the people who consistently show up, no matter what, from generation to generation, for a party. And the Democrats are losing them.In extensive research published last week tracking voter registration, the New York Times identified an alarming pattern. The Democratic party has been “haemorrhaging” voters since way before election day. In the states that track voter registration by political party, Democrats lost toRepublicansin all of them in the years between 2020 and 2024. By the time Kamala Harris took over from Joe Biden, the party had already shed more than 2m votes in those states, and Republicans had gained 2.4m. This is part of a “four-year swing” that amounts to 4.5m votes. In a chilling conclusion, the report states that “few measurements reflect the luster of a political party’s brand more clearly than the choice by voters to identify with it”.The signs get worse the more closely you look. It’s not just a decline in new registered voters, but a hacking away of those natural voters who parties can easily rely on. Some of the sharpest declines were among young voters who came out emphatically for Joe Biden in 2020, thenswungtowards Trump in 2024. An assumption that voters who are young, Black or Latino would register mostly in the Democrats’ favour was no longer safe.The most striking thing about these revelations is how long and consistent the turn-off has been: “There is no silver lining or cavalry coming across the hill,” said one voter registration analyst, “this is month after month, year after year.” They show how during the last election, when the Democrats were battling with the damage of a belated handover from Biden to Harris, and a swirl of otherchallenges, the party was already on the back foot, hostage to a years-long disillusionment. And if you look at some of the reasoning for Democrat abandonment from last year, the same conclusion heaves into view – the Democrats rested on their laurels, and Trump attacked. The vibe contest was between business as usual, and the promise of something different.The result is a cratering of Democrat support that cannot be filled in overnight, or even over the next three years, especially with the party seemingly in disarray, and with a lo-fi leadership in Chuck Schumeraccusedof being “unwilling and unable to meet the moment”. It’s not about the unique, mendacious bewitching of voters by Trump, but something broader. Centre-left parties seem trapped by their inability and unwillingness to articulate values in ways that go beyond just saying the other guys are bad for democracy, by identifying a vision of what and who they arefor.They are operating in a world where traditional coalitions around class, labour and identity are dissolving, where high barriers to home ownership, social mobility and job stability have been erected, and the relationship between hard work and prosperity, or even viability, has been severed. Combine that with an online and media ecosystem that trades in attention and feeling, and you have a political climate that requires policy intervention and campaigning edge.LiveZohran Mamdani: who is New York's Democratic mayoral candidate? – video profileInstead, assummedup by Gabriel Winant after Trump’s victory, Kamala Harris had “stretched her coalition into incoherence” in a “grab bag” of policies “sharing no clear thematic unity or coherence”. This is the result of both a lack of direction, and of a party that now houses both the powerful and those at the losing end of that power, which can only mean a lop-sided capture by the former. Or, as chillinglyobservedby Anton Jäger: “Bankers and warmongers predominate in Democrat ruling circles, the indebted and the marginalised among its rank-and-file.” This reminds me of Keir Starmer’s drive tocastLabour as “pro-business, pro-worker and pro-wealth creation”. You cannot have coherence when the interests you represent, or claim to represent, are by definition antagonistic.‘A new political era’: fresh Democratic faces seek office to prevent their party from ‘sleepwalking into dystopia’Read moreThis brand tension has an analogue in a smaller but no less revealing way in the UK, where students areabandoningLabour. University Labour clubs are disaffiliating from the party, Labour’s youth membership has collapsed, the tail of a longer falling out with Labour leadership overGaza. But this is a broader confrontation between young voters and a party that has failed to stand for any clear moral principles that appeal to the idealism so necessary to create not only future voters, but activists and campaigners. On Gaza, Labour isanti-starvation, but alsoanti-protest.And both the Democrats and Labour are positioning themselves antagonistically to those whose sharper expressions of political vision are hugely popular with those who are abandoning them. Senior Democrats might still not endorse New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani, who is postingstunning polling leads. Labour disciplines MPs for rebelling against benefit cuts, even as hundreds of thousands of peopleregister their supportfor a new party.But as new and future voters are lost, the lion’s share of the windfall goes to those on the right and extreme right who have already mastered the gamification of politics, and the ability to summon fever dreams of threats that must be dealt with and prosperity that is just around the corner. “Elections are won from the centre” goes the old adage, but increasingly the centre itself has changed as the world becomes not a place of wide-tent compromise, but of irreconcilable differences. And I would venture another formulation – elections are won in the past. By the time it becomes apparent that remote and complacent centrist politics is not even managing to convince its own tribes, it will be too late. Some would argue it already is.Nesrine Malik is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsDemocratsOpinionRepublicansChuck SchumerDonald TrumpLabourKeir StarmerUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

Long has already been fired after clashing with the treasury secretary, Scott Bessent. Long was the sixth person to head the IRS this year.Trump’s presidential philosophy is government by shakedown | Steven GreenhouseRead moreLet’s not forget EJ Antoni, whom Trump just nominated to lead the Bureau of Labor Statistics after firing former chief Erika McEntarfer for presiding over a disappointing jobs report earlier this month.Antoni is that rarity who has drawn harsh criticism from economists on the right as well as the mainstream for being ignorant, unprincipled and incompetent. Herecently celebratedthat “all net job growth over the last year went to native-born Americans”.I haven’t even mentioned the towering ineptitude of Trump’s cabinet picks, such as Pete Hegseth, Pam Bondi, Kash Patel, Robert F Kennedy Jr and Kristi Noem.How to explain the rise of so many incompetent and unprincipled people?Easy. They could never succeed on their own merits. As soon as their incompetence became apparent – which was likely to be as soon as they took the first job that required some degree of intelligence and integrity – they were fired.So they learned that to be rewarded with promotions, money and power, they cannot rely on the normal processes and systems of recognition for jobs well done. If they’re to make anything of themselves, they must instead become ass-lickers, lap dogs and sycophants.They must latch on to someone who values loyalty above integrity or competence, someone for whom fawning obsequiousness is the most important criterion for being hired and promoted, ideally someone who cannot tell the difference between a groveling toady and a knowledgeable adviser.Enter Trump.History is strewn with the wreckage of dictatorships that have attracted and promoted incompetent people lacking talent or integrity. As Hannah Arendt explained in her classic The Origins of Totalitarianism:Totalitarianism in power invariably replaces all first-rate talents, regardless of their sympathies, with those crackpots and fools whose lack of intelligence and creativity is still the best guarantee of their loyalty.Early in his career, Trump apprenticed himself to Roy Cohn, an unprincipled lawyer who taught the young Trump how to gain wealth and influence through ruthless bullying, profane braggadocio, opportunistic bigotry, baseless lawsuits, lying, and more lying.Yet as Trump’s “fixer” with politicians, judges and mob bosses, Cohn remained utterly loyal to Trump and his father, Fred.Years later, in his book The Art of the Deal,Trump drew a distinction between integrity and loyalty. He preferred the latter, and for him, Cohn exemplified it.

Blind ambition trips them up. They cannot explain or defend their behavior by relying on principled competence because, like Cohn, they are unprincipled and incompetent to their cores.The people they latch onto meet similar fates but for a different reason.Leaders who value loyalty above all else find themselves surrounded by sycophantic crackpots and fools. As a result, they receive no objective or useful feedback about their actions – no warnings beforehand and no criticism afterward. All they get are commendations – “Wonderful idea, sir!” “Brilliant execution, sir!”These cocoons of flattery seal off such leaders from the real-world consequences of what they do – which inevitably leads them to make grave mistakes. Some of those mistakes eventually cause their downfalls.This perverse symmetry – the certain demise of grovelers because they’re incompetent and unprincipled and the inevitable downfall of those to whom they grovel because they never get useful and truthful feedback – marks the path of all totalitarian systems. It’s the path on which Trump now treads.This is not necessarily cause for hope. If history is any guide, many innocent people suffer before the incompetent grovelers and the vain objects of their groveling meet their inevitable fates.

The US is, according tothe Atlantic, which recently explored the country’s growing enthusiasm for hot stuff (more than half of Americans in a survey said they were likely to buy an item described as “spicy”, up from 39% in 2015) andkiller chillies. Americans have certainly thrown themselves into it – I spent an entertaining hour in a Brooklyn hot sauce emporium last year having tasting profiles of various skull-emblazoned, jokily named bottles earnestly sauce-splained to me by mulleted men– butit’s happened in the UK too. Our cupboards and fridges suggest“little treat” condiment culturehas a masochistic edge: I just counted 19 bottles and jars of angry-looking red stuff in ours; I’m forever succumbing to the must-have small-batch chilli crisps the algorithm offers.Why? Capsaicin, the active component of chilli peppers, supposedlydelivers an endorphin buzz, but it’s surely more cultural than physiological. We’re all global culinary sophisticates these days – no one wants to admit to being the kind of wimp who craves flavourless “white people food”. Chilli’s expanding geographic penetration has probably been helped along by Hot Ones, the YouTube show where celebrities writhe as they submit to ever-spicier chicken wings;Demi Moore’s steely, unbothered performance on it merited many Oscars. I suspect mouth-boredom plays a part too – there’s so much flavour everywhere now it would give my Celtic ancestors heart failure, so our jaded palates crave more intense stimulation.But whether you’re aCarolina Reapereater or intimidated by red Doritos, everyone gets a chilli humbling eventually. Mine came, humiliatingly, in Paris this spring. “Choose a spice level from one to five,” the waiter in a Laotian restaurant said. “Five is really hot. Three is quite spicy.” Judging myself reasonably robust, and French people chilli-averse, (I should have readAlexander Hurst’s exploration of the new French appreciation for hot stufflast year), I went with three and nearly died. Requesting more water from the waiter, sinuses brutalised and ears painfully ringing (does anyone else get this with chilli?), I rasped out a tearful acknowledgment that he was right, itwasquite spicy. For days after, my stomach lining demanded only the blandest, beigest of white people food.Emma Beddington is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsHerbs and spicesOpinionFoodcommentShareReuse this content"

It has allowed me to build bridges across cultures, to connect with people from vastly different walks of life and to find a sense of belonging wherever I’ve been: Australia, Germany, Pakistan or Afghanistan. Each language I’ve learned has brought with it a new lens through which to view the world. But nothing has stirred my soul quite like Persian – the language of mystics and lovers.My journey into the Persian language felt less like consciously acquiring a new skill and more like unlocking a secret passage inside myself. It has opened doors not just to new ideas and ways of thinking but to the deepest emotions. For the first time, I’ve found a language that doesn’t just help me navigate time and space in mere practical terms but helps me to express and feel every moment beyond that.Amid the chaos after the fall of Kabul, two men became my lifeline | Shadi Khan SaifRead moreMy journey with Persian began a couple of years ago, with some naive assumptions and fake smiles when Persian-speaking Afghans cracked jokes. I was new in Kabul, following years of wandering in neighbouring Pakistan and then later in Europe. I had no idea about this second national language of the country – mine was Pashtu. I have been fascinated with the Persian language since learning it in an entirely natural way – just by talking to friends, through music, movies and poetry. It is the cultural elegance so woven into the language and its abundance of rich emotional expressions that make it unique.For instance, consider “Nosh-e jaan” (May it nourish you) said to someone eating food, or “Gul Gufti” (Your words are beautiful like roses). There’s also “Del-at shad bashad” (May your heart be joyful)or“Khak-e paye tu-am”(I am the dust beneath your feet), used to show respect to and love of elders or teachers. These may sound bizarrely formal, but they are everyday staples in Persian.From its greetings to the haunting depth of its classical verse, Persian is rich with rhythm, subtlety and emotional nuance. It is a language that carries music in its tone and wisdom from the music of Bollywood to the mountains of Afghanistan to the valleys of Iran, orchids of central Asia and as far as the gates of Europe in Turkey. Even the most ordinary phrases seem to hum with history and feeling. It’s as if every word carries a centuries-old heartbeat.In Persian I’ve discovered expressions for emotions I had long felt but could never articulate. I’ve found metaphors that mirror my own journey, phrases that feel like home and poetry that speaks directly to the soul. It’s more than a means of communication – it’s a new way of being, of loving, of remembering and of dreaming.My romance with Persian began when Afghanistan’s Pashtu speakers were pushing to reclaim status and space for their language in a country with a deep-rooted Afghan dialect, Dari, which has long been used in almost all official communications. For me, the politics of it hardly mattered. I had learned Pashtu at home from my sweet mum and loved it as my inner core language, before learning my second language, Urdu/Hindi, then English and Punjabi during my years in Pakistan’s biggest and most diverse metropolis, Karachi. I learned German when I went to work at that country’s public broadcaster Deutsche Welle in Bonn. English, perhaps the most professionally transformative of the languages I speak, is the language I write in, but it remains a bit foreign and a bit distant. Like a guest who had overstayed but never fully moved in.Persian was not a language I learned; it was one that absorbed me. Unlike the others, Persian didn’t just expand my vocabulary – it rewired my emotions. It cracked open an interior world I hadn’t known how to access. It wasn’t about fluency – it was about awakening.Fragrant smoke on a wintry Melbourne night rekindles friendships and evokes memories of home in far-off Kabul | Shadi Khan SaifRead moreIt is a language that doesn’t shy away from feeling. It doesn’t rush towards meaning or neat endings; it lingers. In Persian even pain is a form of grace. You don’t just say you’re missing someone, you say “Dil-tangetam”“My heart is constricted because of you”. “Safa avordi” (You brought good energy/joy with you),is often said when a guest visits.For me, someone who wasn’t lucky enough to spend hours reading Persian books when I stayed in Kabul, it is delightful to see how convenient it is to access the Persian maestro, Afghanistan-born Jalal al-Din Balkhi or Mawlana or Rumi as he is known around the world. He is like the god of Persian language for me.I remember the moment I first read this line by Rumi in its original form:Asheq sho, gar na ruzi kar-e jahan sar ayad – Nakhande naqsh-e maqsud az kargah-e hasti.Fall in love, or someday the work of the world will end – And you’ll leave this workshop of being without having seen its purpose.Somewhere in this journey of learning Persian, I felt its role in overcoming the noise of modern urgency. There’s a word in Persian –delneshin– that means something that sits sweetly on the heart. That’s what Persian has become for me. A quiet, enduring echo.Shadi Khan Saif is an editor, producer and journalist who has worked in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Germany and AustraliaExplore more on these topicsLanguagesOpinionPoetrycommentShareReuse this content"

The current president of the United States is 79 years old, so we don’t have much time left to sort this one out. Trump clearly has eternity at the top of his agenda, having spoken on at least two occasions aboutwhat happens when we die. He called into a radio program called the Todd Starnes Show, which is a thing people listen to when the internet is out on their block. He waxed on about his military deployment in Washington DC, but also about thepossible systemthat decides the fate of your everlasting soul. “There has to be some kind of a report card up there someplace, y’know, like: ‘Let’s go to heaven, let’s get into heaven.’ It’s sort of a beautiful thing,” he said to Starnes. He’s probably hoping they grade on a curve.On Fox News, Trumpexpressed serious doubthe’s going to get called up to the big leagues of life after death. “I want to try and get to heaven if possible. I’m hearing I’m not doing well. I’m really at the bottom of the totem pole.” I don’t know who he’s hearing this from. Is there a Quinnipiac poll I haven’t read? Has Steve Kornacki weighed in from the MSNBC (sorry, MS Now)big board?Unfortunately, the choice is out of my hands. The afterlife is not exactly a democracy. According to the Catholic church, only God himself can cast a ballot. Even St Peter doesn’t get a say, though I was told that’s because he alwaysforgets to bring his driver’s licenseto the polling place. If things get dicey for the president, he can always sue. The supreme court is open to hearing his arguments.Don’t let Donald Trump undermine your faith in the climate fight | Gina McCarthyRead moreIt’s understandable that the man is publicly pondering the results of his nearly eight decades of acting almost exclusively in his own best interest, as a real estate mogul, reality TV star, WWE Hall of Famer,steak salesman, McDonald’saficionado, andCats enthusiast. The latter should be enough to get him booted downstairs, but again, I don’t get to decide. Bad taste is not disqualifying in the eyes of the Lord, which is why I’m positiveEd HardyandDamien Hirststill have a shot at it.Deep down, even the most hardened atheist probably hopes that heaven exists, that there’s a punter’s chance we can frolic in the clouds wearing resplendent robes and play the harp all day. The alternatives – a fiery nightmare or the yawning void of nothing – aren’t so pleasant.I’m more than a few years the president’s junior, so I hopefully have a bit longer before I get the answer to the ultimate question, but it’s never too early to plan for the future. I also want to get into heaven, but I don’t have a clue how to go about doing it. So I did what any sensible human being would do when faced with a test they didn’t study for.I asked ChatGPT.As soon as I asked, my computer fan went into overdrive. The battery also started emitting a toxic stench that not only repelled my dog, but also caused my neighbors to break down my door to make sure I wasn’t quietly decaying in my living room.After the smell died down, I got back to work. ChatGPT squirted out a brief summary of all the major religions’ stances on heavenly prerequisites. Besides the obvious ones, such as faith in God, the to-dos read suspiciously like a college application. You need to do charity work, study and donate a million dollars to the alumni foundation. Easy stuff.ChatGPT wrapped up with some final “thoughts” on the matter, which didn’t much clarify the practical steps necessary to earn the all-you-can-eat buffet in the sky.“In many traditions, the emphasis isn’t just on ‘getting into heaven,’ but on living a life of compassion, integrity, and faith. While paths differ, a common thread in many religions is the importance of love, kindness, and striving to become the best version of oneself.”I guess I’ll do my best, but I can count at least five times where I didn’t let everyone exit the elevator before I got on or forgot to send a gift to a newlywed couple. I might be screwed. And if I’m screwed, how will Trump fare? In this moment of pessimism for our dear leader, I figured I should follow in his footsteps,ignore evidence I don’t want to hearand find a more sympathetic source.The Billy Graham Evangelistic Association has a helpfularticleentitled “How Can I Know for Sure I’ll Go to Heaven?” Almost immediately, I was comforted. Graham is quoted as saying: “Your salvation depends on what [Christ] has done for you, not on what you do for Him. It isn’t your hold on God that saves you; it’s His hold on you.”California’s governor has become an anti-Trump comedian. It’s 2017 all over again | Dave SchillingRead moreI’ve seen enough. I’m pretty sure I understand all I need to know about saving myself from the cursed lash of the dark lord Lucifer. I don’t have to do anything. Full stop. Instead of thinking about how I behave, how I treat others, or what heavy responsibility I must carry in the corporeal world, I just need to check in to see how many goodies God has sent my way so far. Just like being a child, you know if your parents love you based on how many toys they purchase and how expensive they are. I drive an Audi, so I think I’m probably on the nice list.The article continues: “You can be a loving person, a good person, and even volunteer of the year, but it’ll never be good enough.” Perfect. I don’t even volunteer to help with my son’s homework, I’m riddled with credit card debt and take far too long to clip my toenails. Doesn’t sound like I need to try any harder than “pays the absolute minimum monthly amount” and “trims directly on to the floor of the bathroom, which my girlfriend has repeatedly asked me to not do”.If we’re to use Billy Graham’s words as a guide,Donald Trumpis going to make it upstairs. The only real requirement is that you have to have a personal relationship with God. He has a lot of money, which means God loves him. Eternity, like business, is all about networking. And who’s a better networker than Donald J Trump? Even if Trump doesn’t have God’s personal cellphone number, I’m sure he can ask his friends at the FBI to find it.Dave Schilling is a Los Angeles-based writer and humoristExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionReligioncommentShareReuse this content"

He was my best friend – he seemed sure of himself and possessed that type of musical taste that made everything else feel cringe. He moved from genre to genre with a sense of purpose. I, meanwhile, merely followed – diligently, even devoutly. When he discovered black metal, I followed him there too.Soon, my bedroom began to resemble a mausoleum: there were band posters featuring men made up to look like corpses glowering into Nordic fog, and CDs with tracklists that looked more like incantations than music. I began dressing the part – black on black on black. I scoured forums for rare pressings and live bootlegs. And yet, I didn’t really know what I was listening to.The music itself was hypnotic: raw, relentless, thick with atmosphere. It sounded like alienation and angst and misanthropy – which, to a teenager, was more or less the point. It gave form to rebellion. But I didn’t take a look behind the scenes. I just savouredthe vibes.At a certain point, my friend told me that Varg Vikernes, the man behind the Norwegian music project Burzum,had killed his bandmateand served time for murder. “Erm, what are we supposed to do with that?” we wondered.We shrugged and said we’d shun his music and focus on others’ instead. Cool.Then my cousin called. He’s 11 years older than me – hetaught me how to play chesswhen I was a child, picked books for me to read, was generally level-headed. I’d mentioned some of the bands I was into during a visit. He’d done what I hadn’t: looked them up. Translated lyrics. Read interviews. Traced connections. What he found made my stomach turn.A number of these bands, it turned out, weren’t just provocateurs with a flair for the macabre. They trafficked in something darker: coded fascist imagery, explicit Nazi sympathies, antisemitic allusions. Some had links to actual hate groups. Others sang odes to racial purity in archaic languages or quoted far-right ideologues beneath layers of rune fonts. Graveland and Nokturnal Mortum – bands I had once prized for their “atmosphere” – were now impossible to listen to in the same way.Graveland’s founderRob Darkenoften expressed white nationalist views and aligned himself with pagan fascist ideas. At the beginning of their career, Nokturnal Mortum had strong ties to theNational Socialist black metal(NSBM) scene; band members gave interviews endorsing neo-Nazi ideologies. What we’d thought was merely transgressive turned out, in some cases, to be ideologically clear – and its ideology was ethno-nationalism, fascism and white supremacy.My cousin didn’t lecture me. He didn’t make me feel small. He just said: “You’re smart. But don’t let your intelligence make you careless.”That sentence shifted something. Because he was right – I hadn’t been careless by accident. I’d made myself un-curious. I didn’t want to know what the lyrics said and what the bands represented because knowing might have ruined the world I’d built. Back then, I thought I was choosing the music. But in truth, I was choosing to belong to something.After that conversation, I began to step back. And interestingly, so did my friend. The more we read – the more we realised that the fringe aesthetics were, in some cases, a smokescreen for deeply held hatred – the harder it became to hear the music without flinching. The image we’d constructed, of misanthropic musicians howling into cold landscapes, collapsed. What was left was more troubling: a subculture in which some members wore ideology as easily as face paint. The aesthetic wasn’t just surface; it was camouflage.We both stopped listening – not all at once, but steadily. I boxed up the CDs. We unfollowed the forums. Eventually, the friend and I drifted apart, though not because of the music, not directly. Life intervened.And here’s what I still wonder: if my cousin hadn’t said anything, would I have noticed? Would I have cared? Would I have ended up defending ideas I didn’t believe in simply because they came wrapped in sounds I loved?We like to imagine that we are the authors of our convictions – that ideology arrives through argument and reason. But often it slips in sideways, piggybacking on aesthetics, community, taste. When you’re young, especially, belonging can matter more than belief. You pick up codes and allegiances without even noticing. You mouth things before you mean them. And the more you repeat them, the more you become them.What saved me wasn’t my own moral clarity, but a quiet act of attention. Someone I trusted took the time to investigate what I hadn’t, and offered that knowledge without condescension. It didn’t feel like a confrontation. It felt like being gently turned back toward myself.I still listen to loud music. Techno, for instance. But if the music has lyrics, I listen to them. I ask more questions. I know how easy it is to be seduced by the feeling of depth without understanding what lies at the bottom.Ana Schnabl is a Slovenian novelist, editor and criticDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

For more than nine months, mass student-ledprotestsin Serbia have been challenging the authoritarian rule of Aleksandar Vučić, who has been in office as prime minister and president for 11 years. Up to now, Brussels has largely opted to look away.The catalyst for some of the largest demonstrations in Serbia’s history was thecollapseof a newly renovated railway station roof in the country’s second city, Novi Sad, leading to the deaths of 16 people. The disaster was widely attributed to entrenched fraud and corruption presided over by Mr Vučić’s ruling Serbian Progressive party, and swiftly became the spark for a movement for democratic reform. The students are demanding early elections and a new era of transparency and accountability, in what remains an EU candidate country.As anger and frustration in the streets has mounted, Mr Vučić’s response has become increasingly draconian. Groundlessly claiming that foreign agitators were seeking an “imported revolution”, the president launched a ruthlesscrackdownon civil society groups in receipt of foreign funds. On the streets, orchestrated mobs this month attacked protesters andreportedlylooted businesses owned by opponents of Mr Vučić. There have been widespreadreportsof police brutality. Amid the spiral of violence, one recent anti-government demonstration in Belgrade took place under theslogan“Let’s show them we’re not a punchbag”.The protesters deserve more support and solidarity from the EU than they are receiving. Autocratic and cynical, Mr Vučić is a malign presence in the politics of the western Balkans. Beyond Serbia’s borders, he has longcultivatedan insidious and destabilising ethno-nationalist agenda in relation to Kosovo and Republika Srpska – the ethnic Serb entity in Bosnia and Herzegovina. At home, he has increasingly become a menace to democracy.The Organization for Security and Co-operation inEuropefound that Serbia’s parliamentary elections last year were marred by media bias and the use of government patronage networks to influence the vote. The authoritarian response to the protests – which have spread to the small-town heartlands of Mr Vučić’s support – has contributed to a collapse in public trust in a leader who has harnessed the power of the state to serve his own political interests.If it wished to use it, the EU has considerable economic leverage to deploy. The blocprovidesmore than 60% of foreign direct investment into Serbia and has pledged €1.6bn to Belgrade by 2027, tied to future reforms. But Brussels is loth to see the country slip anyfurtherinto Russia’s orbit and has, as a consequence, soft-pedalled any criticism of Mr Vučić. For his part, the president has played a wily geopolitical balancing act,sendingarms via third parties to Kyiv, as well as Moscow, and granting the EU crucial access to Serbia’s significant lithium reserves.Following this summer’s violence, Mr Vučić belatedlycalledlast week for a dialogue with protesters. But what Serbia needs is free and fair elections, and the reversal of the authoritarian creep of the past decade. At a time when the EU’s liberal values are being challenged in Washington as well as Moscow and Beijing, it needs to stand up for them far more robustly in a battle for democratic reform taking place just outside its own borders.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Followers are doing themselves no favoursMon 25 Aug 2025 13.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 25 Aug 2025 14.28 EDTShareOnce, it seemed that much of the world was intent on drastically cutting back on meat for health andenvironmentalreasons. Vegetarian and vegan options appeared on restaurant menus and the very idea of a bloody red steak became almost unthinkable in liberal circles. And yetthe carnivore dietis now all over Instagram and TikTok, prompting health bodies to start issuing warnings.Followers of this diet eat meat, fat, seafood, eggs and butter, avoiding all vegetables, fruits, grains and legumes as if plants were, as Paul Saladino, an advocate of this diet alleged, “poison”. Dr Saladino is a US psychiatrist and health influencer with a range of supplements called Heart and Soil that contain dried animal organ meat. He appears shirtless on social media, denouncing vegetables, which he says will harm us. Other Instagrammers tuck into plates of huge steaks and seven or more eggs for breakfast. It’s not just for weight loss.Joe Rogan has claimed onTikTokthat his brain was working better after a week of meat, fat, bacon and eggs, and nothing else. Others show off huge muscles or say their skin has improved. There’s something messianic in their insistence that going carnivore has changed their life.This is a virtually zero-carbohydrate, high-fat diet, whose antecedents are the Banting diet, promoted as early as 1863, theAtkins dietin 1972 and the ketogenic diet, originally developed in the 1920s as a treatment for epilepsy, but reborn in the 1990s for weight loss. They force the body to burn energy from its fat stores, instead of glucose from carbohydrates, inducing a state known as ketosis. People on low-carb diets can lose the initial pounds quickly. But studies comparing the results with those of people eating a mixed diet found that after a year, the weight loss was the same. What works best is the diet that you can stick to.The British Heart Foundation says that the carnivore diet could be harmful. “Extreme diets high in saturated fat and low in fibre are known to raise cholesterol levels, increasing the risk of heart attack and stroke,” itwarnedlast month. Eating protein and fat does not raise blood sugar levels as much as carbohydrates, but cutting down on carbs – not cutting them out – is the answer, or you lose fibre that is crucial for the immune system, as well as other nutrients. Reports that parents areputting infants on these dietsare particularly alarming.But protein is trending, and no longer just for bodybuilders and sports enthusiasts. Supermarkets are full of protein-packed snacks, ready-meals and shakes for shoppers who have heard that it will build them a better body. Yet almost everyone eats more protein than they need: a minimum of 0.75g per kilogram of body weight, according to NHS-backed guidelines, although athletes and older people may need more. That’s around 56g a day for an average man and 46g for an average woman, equivalent to a bowl of cereal with skimmed milk, a Greek yoghurt and a lean chicken breast.Nutrition shouldn’t be a fashion item. Fad diets don’t work. Balanced eating is best for health, most experts say, as in theMediterranean diet, which includes a wide variety of fruits, vegetables, wholegrains and seeds, and even permits a bit of red wine. It may not go viral on TikTok, but it works. We should all drink to that.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Plus a letter fromDr Richard ClubbMon 25 Aug 2025 13.03 EDTLast modified on Mon 25 Aug 2025 14.28 EDTShareStella Creasy and Peter Hain make a very good argument for changes in the process of proscription and legislation on public order (We voted for and against the ban on Palestine Action. Now we have a plan to end this mess, 18 August). They argue also for “police guidance … by setting out a test of proportionality for any interventions”. Leaving aside the expectation that our police forces already act in a proportionate manner (ie do not intentionally act disproportionately), there is existing guidance on proportionality. This is in the Crown Prosecution Service’s code for crown prosecutors, and it is but a small step to apply its principles to police interventions with a view to prosecution.The CPS code has a two-stage test, and both must be met before a prosecution can be brought. Stage one requires there to be a “realistic prospect of conviction” (ie evidential sufficiency), and stage two requires prosecution to be in the “public interest”. It is surely in the public interest that criminal prosecutions, which may result in severe penalties, should be proportionate – and it would be outwith the public interest for someone to be brought before a criminal court when such an action is disproportionate.It remains to be seen whether, and how, the CPS follows its own instructions (through the code) in the current cases. In the meantime, the police could bear this in mind when considering arrest, removal, detention, and preparation of a case for prosecution.Leslie BeaumontCroston, LancashireStella Creasyand Peter Hain are right to underline what a mess the current situation is. The government’s fundamental mistake has been to attempt to address a problem of mob violence and other forms of relatively low-level but unpleasant intimidation by resorting to anti-terrorist legislation.At the same time, the Terrorism Act 2000 needed a complete overhaul long before the current controversy overPalestine Action. The act’s long list of proscribed organisations scarcely reflects the reality that this century, despite a few horrific cases of mass casualty terrorism, drunk-driving has posed a much greater threat to the lives of the British public than all the groups on this list put together.The same is even true of Northern Ireland. In the 12 monthsto March 2025, no one died as a result of the “security situation” in the province. Undeterred, the Home Office lists numerous terrorist groups in Northern Ireland, ignoring the fact that they are inactive, defunct, or have long been on ceasefire and decommissioned their weapons, or were only ever flags of convenience for larger organisations.But a more urgent fix is required immediately if the situation over Palestine Action is not to spiral out of control. The most practical is that it should be made clear by the government and the police that there will be no prosecutions under terrorism legislation that do not involve murder, attempted murder or steps towards that end.Adrian GuelkeBelfastI was unable to attend the recent Palestine Action support rally in London due to poor mobility. With further protests planned next month, I am thus asking the home secretary to facilitate theMetropolitan policein providing domiciliary arrests.

I can’t even name that many, 19 August). Nowadays 50% of the world’s daily calorie intake comes from justthree species: wheat, corn and rice.In 2020, I decided to live off “foraging for nettles” – as Zoe puts it – for a year in Scotland, eating only free, wild food. During that period I ate 300 plant species, 21 seaweed species and 87 types of mushroom. This is not untypical of hunter-gatherer intake, and most Indigenous six-year-olds can identify the same number of plants as an adult. While commercially produced and processed foods provide calories, it is plants that produce the incredible variety of micronutrients, antioxidants, flavonoids etc that our bodies need to stay healthy and free of the inflammation that causes pain and so many “modern diseases”.The Wildbiome Projectmeasured the health metrics of 120 people who ate only wild foods for periods of one or three months in 2023 and 2025. The results are fascinating, with many unexpected improvements across a range of health issues. These will soon be published in an open-source, peer-reviewed journal.The inability to name fruit and vegetable species is a reflection of a wider general decline in familiarity with the natural world. It goes along with the growing inability to identify trees, birds, butterflies and insects. The loss of names translates to a loss of awareness, which blinds us to species decline and extinction. Sadly, we don’t miss unnamed, vanished species until it’s too late – whether in the outside world or inside our guts.Mo WildePrincipal researcher, The Wildbiome ProjectHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

We have given two really good performances [without Isak or a senior striker] and ended up with one point. Alex’s quality would have made a difference in the two games.“I’ve very mixed feelings tonight. It was a great performance from us. I’m gutted for the players. Everyone had told me Anthony’s card was a clear red but I think he was slightly unlucky. There was no intent to damage [Virgil] van Dijk but he’s probably gone in too quickly. Will Osula came on, scored a goal and did well, but we are running out of attacking options.”Not that Howe was entirely downcast. “These players make me proud,” he said. “They are entwined into Newcastle, they want to be here and want to play. They are connected to the club in a way that is really deep. That was an incredible place to play football. As a football club I thought we showcased our talents.

Back in the late 90s I was working at the golf magazine Fore! when the deputy editor, Simon Caney, returned to the office after being thrashed 6&5 by a tiny eight-year-old who had shown him no mercy. His name? Tommy Fleetwood. Now the rest of the world knows that killer instinct exists, too.But Fleetwood’s FedEx Cup victory, his first in 164 events on thePGA Tour, also reinforced something else. Everyone loves Tommy. Right. Left. Maga. Liberal. Whatever. It doesn’t matter.At East Lake they were chanting his name as he lifted the trophy – while on X, Tiger Woods, Adam Sandler and Caitlin Clark all posted their support. Even on social media, so often a cesspit of anger and bile, the equivalent of a Christmas Day armistice broke out.Tommy Fleetwood wins Tour Championship to finally break US duckRead moreBack in 2023 a survey in Sportico found that PGA supporters were among the most rightward fanbases in sport, with 56% self-identified as “more conservative” compared with 44% who were “more liberal”. Yet in our hyper-polarised world, where sides are taken and battle lines drawn, Fleetwood is one of the few male sports stars for whom we universally root.How many others come to mind? Leo Messi, Carlos Alcaraz and Luke Littler, for sure. Scottie Scheffler and Justin Rose, too. Until last week I would have said Eberechi Eze as well. But after that my list soon dries up.Of course seeing the nearly man of golf finally break America was behind the vast outpouring of joy on Sunday. How could it not be? But Fleetwood’s reaction to his victory showed you why so many were willing him home in the first place.After he hit the winning putt he leaned back and screamed towards the heavens in an act of joy and catharsis, before the camera panned to Justin Rose and Shane Lowry, who were both celebrating. But before greeting his Ryder Cup teammates, Fleetwood went over to hug his stepson Oscar, who was sobbing away, and ask him: “Are you OK?”View image in fullscreenTommy Fleetwood embraces his stepson, Oscar, on the 18th green after claiming victory at East Lake.Photograph: Jared C Tilton/Getty ImagesYou can’t fake genuine. And that one small act told you everything you need to know about Fleetwood. Even in the moment of his greatest triumph, he was being human and thinking of others.Then again Fleetwood, the son of a roadworker from Southport who started playing at his local municipal course, has long shown us the type of person he is. When President Trump criticised the NHS in 2018, for instance, Fleetwood retweeted a post telling him to mind his own business. And then he made his feelings ever clearer in an interview in the Times shortly afterwards. “I thought what he said was absolute rubbish,” he said. “There are certain things you are proud of as a British citizen and the NHS is by far and away the No 1 thing. I’m a big believer.”Of course things got a bit hairy on Sunday. There was a wobble on holes 8, 9 and 10, and with Scheffler and Keegan Bradley mounting a charge you feared that history might repeat itself. If Fleetwood was nervous he certainly had plenty of time to think about it, too, given his playing partner, Patrick Cantlay, was dawdling even more than usual.Imagine what was going through Fleetwood’s mind. In the past seven years he had finished in the top five 29 times on the PGA without winning. No wonder that when he led by two shots with three holes to play, as he had at the Travelers and the St Jude Championship, he had the walk of a condemned man. Yet this time the nerve held.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It was classic Fleetwood, modest and self-effacing.Beforehand he had talked about taking the positives from every setback. That is what every sports star says, of course. But Fleetwood actually proved as good as his word.How he didn’t plunge into a doom‑spiral or weeks of self-pity should be a subject for a sports psychology textbook. And his victory also served as a pick‑me-up to the rest of us. Perhaps if you take enough shots at something, even when you are getting kicked in the teeth, the hard work will pay off.Either way, it always felt harsh for some to brand Fleetwood a choker, or – as in Paul Azinger’s case five years ago – demand that he win in the US to prove himself.The 34-year-old is, after all, a multiple winner on the DP World Tour and an Olympic silver medallist. He also gained four points out of five on his Ryder Cup debut in 2018 and earned the Cup-winning point in Rome in 2023. You don’t do that if your knees are always knocking under pressure.View image in fullscreenShane Lowry was among those keen to applaud the success of his Ryder Cup teammate Tommy Fleetwood.Photograph: Andrew J Clark/ISI Photos/Getty ImagesTrue, this wasn’t the biggest or most dramatic golfing victory of the year.Rory McIlroy at the Masterssewed up that award long ago. But it was, to these eyes, the most heartwarming: the equivalent of a John Lewis Christmas advert that makes you feel better every time you think about it.Of course it will be very different when it comes to the Ryder Cup in four weeks’ time. President Trump will be there. The crowd will be pumped up and baying for blood. And there certainly won’t be any “Tommy! Tommy!” chants.But for now we can all rejoice in having watched Fleetwood break the curse.

There was not a single penny of actual funding attached to it. We are backing sport because we know how much it matters. It changes people’s lives.”Despite no commitment from Labour for further funding, theECBplans to continue pushing for additional money next year to coincide with England’s staging of the Women’s T20 World Cup, the final of which will be held at Lord’s for the first time. The ECB chair, Richard Thompson, welcomed the initial investment and expressed hope that more would follow to ensure a legacy of more widespread and diverse participation follows the World Cup.“We are pleased to secure government support for these incredible community facilities, which we hope will provide a vital proof point of what can be achieved, and look forward to future collaboration,” Thompson said.“As we look ahead to hosting the ICC Women’s T20 World Cup in 2026, building on that success by rolling out more domes in communities across England and Wales will be key to creating a genuine and lasting legacy from the tournament.“These state-of-the-art all-weather cricket domes will be transformative for the communities they serve, opening up cricket to more people year-round and providing top-class facilities for elite players too. They are an important part of our plans to break down barriers and make cricket the most inclusive team sport.”The ECB’s target is to get an extra 900,000 young people playing cricket by 2029, with the domes an integral part of its Plan for Change as they are to be built in urban areas targeting children who do not play cricket at school, many from diverse and underprivileged backgrounds. The domes have been designed by the ECB in collaboration with Total-play, a cricket facility specialist.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

If more funding is secured the ECB would seek to build domes in cities staging games at the World Cup next year – Manchester, Leeds, Birmingham, Southampton, Bristol and London.“The greatest example of social cohesion is when you see white working-class lads playing with Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs, Indians, Pakistanis, Bangladeshis, it cuts through the divides in an extraordinary way,” Thompson said. “This isn’t so much about sport. This is about society and where sport can solve some of society’s ills.”The announcement on Monday is part of the government’s wider National Youth Strategy, which will be published this autumn.Explore more on these topicsCricketECBLisa NandySport politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Photographs by Pablo GarciaMon 25 Aug 2025 10.50 EDTLast modified on Mon 25 Aug 2025 18.56 EDTShare“When the players went out, they were like ‘pfff, what a great atmosphere’,” Xabi Alonso said at the close of a night so long-awaited many didn’t make it, and many of those who did were actually experiencingprimerafor the first time. At the north end of the Carlos Tartiere, Real Oviedo’s fans prepared to reveal another gigantic work of art, 1,800 square metres oftifosent tumbling across the terrace. Beneath the west stand, the city’s bagpipers got ready to play theAsturian anthem. Near the tunnel, Elena and Carlos, the embodiment of an entire generation, waited to kick it all off. And everywhere, in the city and the stadium, there was blue. Into it all, Real Madrid stepped on Sunday night. And, their manager said, it was “spectacular”.They had missed it. The last time Madrid had been to Oviedo was 10 June 2001, the last first division game in the Tartiere. That day, a fortnight after Oviedo had beaten Barcelona at the Camp Nou, they drew 1-1 with Vicente del Bosque’s side, Santi Solari scoring. “I prefer to forget it,” Veljko Paunovic says, but he can’t. “We missed so many chances; I had two, one hit the bar.” A win and Oviedo would have been safe; instead, seven days later they lost 4-2 at Mallorca and were relegated. It took 24 years to return toprimera, nine days more to do so at home. Coincidence, or perhaps a kind of closure, decided it would be against the same team as the last time, 8,841 days later.Another 168 teams have been there since, many of whom you probably haven’t heard of, all of which Oviedo can now be proud of: Pumarín, Atlético Astorga, Colloto. Montañeros, Condal de Noreña, Real Titánico. Or tiny CD Mosconia, even though there may be no goal that meant as much as the one Kily Álvarez scored against them. When Madrid last came, Paunovic was an Oviedo midfielder; now he is the manager, the manwho won promotion toprimerain June, immediately messaging the teammates who went down with him in 2001. “It’s been very emotional,” he said, “this is like closing a circle, repaying a debt. It transcends football.”View image in fullscreenFans overlooking the Carlos Tartiere Stadium.View image in fullscreenFlares are lit as supporters descend on the ground.View image in fullscreenArriving ahead of kick-off for the club’s first top-flight match in 24 years.View image in fullscreenWalking into the stadium.Football always does, and on Sunday night it was felt, even by Madrid’s players. This is not justonce-big team gets relegated and takes too long to return, so long that loads of the Oviedo fans who sang about doing so never saw them play inprimerain the first place and countless more didn’t live to see it happen. It is not that Oviedo fell in 2001, it is that they kept falling. Not just that they are in the first division now but that theyare, not just that they might not have made it back but that they might not have made it at all. The last time they faced Madrid was against their C team. And it might have been the last time they ever faced anyone.Before this weekend’s game Oviedo produced a matchday poster that portrayed the two teams as old acquaintances crossing paths again. “Tell me, how’s it been going … ” the message says. At the top of the image, Real Madrid lift another European Cup. At the bottom, Real Oviedo’sformer goalkeeper Rafa Ponzo stands in the mud. Since 2001, while Oviedo have been away, Madrid have won 11 leagues and seven Champions Leagues. Oviedo have been down to the second division, second division b – an 82-team league of four regional divisions – andtercera, where there are more than 350 teams across 17 divisions. They have been relegated two divisions in the same season, had an owner on the run from Interpol and politicians trying to kill them off. Twice they were on the verge of folding, gone for ever. Which was when the fans came in, and which is why this was much more than just a promotion, a first division homecoming.Instead of coming back up after relegation in 2001, they went down again two years on, from the second division to the second division b. Worse, debts spiralled, reaching 7bn pesetas (€42m), the list of creditors headed by the tax office, Betis, bank, and social security. When players reported the club for unpaid salaries, an extra division was added to their fall, sent down totercera. They also started the following season on minus-six points. If they started it at all. The headline in one local paper said it all. “It’s over.”“All that’s left is to sign the death certificate,” said the local mayor, Gabino de Lorenzo, and he was keen to do that. “Given the imminent disappearance of professional football in the city,de jure and de facto,” a draft agreement began, the council invited the local amateur club Astur to take their place. Astur changed their name to Oviedo ACF, their colours to Oviedo’s colours, their badge to something near-identical to Oviedo’s. They signed Oviedo’s record appearance maker. The council promised Astur a €91,000 subsidy and the use of the Tartiere. Newspapers in the mayor’s pocket backed the project, talked up full houses that weren’t full and popular support that didn’t exist, something tin-pot dictator in the tone. Sample line: “Gabino received an improvised homage with a huge ovation when he arrived at the ground”.View image in fullscreenBagpipers play the Asturian anthem before the match.View image in fullscreenA proud supporter.View image in fullscreenA huge tifo unfurled before kick-off.View image in fullscreenPassion in the stands.As it turned out, it was what Oviedo needed – something to go to war for, a cause to defend, anger to fuel it, an enemy to take on. “The poison cured you,” as one Oviedo song goes. Astur were the clone, the freak; Real Oviedo were therealOviedo, and there was a reawakening, a rebellion.Led by president Manolo Lafuente fans answered the call: they brought generators, cut grass, painted stands, and started calling season ticket holders one by one, putting together homemade membership cards. Eventually there were 11,700 of them. In their entire time down in what they came to call the “mud” – a word used metaphorically and literally – Oviedo never had less than 10,000. They built a team too, with a skeleton staff, only six of 40 remaining. The entire squad had gone. So had youth players Juan Mata, Santi Cazorla and Adrián López, forced out amid the chaos. They had no hot water, no electricity and no players but within two weeks they had a team and it was theirs, an identity forged, a sense of belonging. It was precarious but they played, starting with that win over CD Mosconia, and they were proud. Defeated, the city council eventually quietly dropped Astur.Then it went wrong again. A new owner arrived in 2006, an apparent saviour. Wanted for two counts of fraud, Alberto González went missing. In 2012 Oviedo were again on the verge of folding. An interim board – heroes all – had a plan, one last roll of the dice. Again fans rose, backed this time by supporters from around the world. An SOS went out and they responded. In the midst of it, Oviedo played Real Madrid C. That day thousands marched to the ground. 20,500 were at the game, in the third tier. Real Madrid C’s players brought shares. Their club underwrote €100,000 worth. In two weeks, 36,962 people in 86 countries had brought shares. Watching the phenomenon spread, the Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim brought shares, taking Oviedo over the threshold, its future secured. In 2022, some of those were sold to the Pachuca group.In 2003, as it left Oviedo to die, the city council had declared that the Astur project would “return football in Oviedo to the place it deserves to be”; 22 years on, 24 years after they departed the top flight, it happened: not the way they wanted, but the way everyone else did. Sprinting on to the pitch was Cazorla who had been forced out by the crisis and finally played his first game for his boyhood club at 38, then took them toprimeraat 40. On local radio Miguel Fernandi, the voice of Oviedo through the muddy years, met the playoff final whistle with: “You tried to kill us, you tried to assassinate us, you tried to replace us, and 24 years later, we’re inprimera.”Quick GuideLa Liga resultsShowOviedo 0-3 Real Madrid, Villarreal 5-0 Girona, Real Sociedad 2-2 Espanyol, Osasuna 1-0 Valencia, Mallorca 1-1 Celta Vigo, Atlético Madrid 1-1 Elche, Levante 2-3 Barcelona, Real Betis 1-0 AlvesWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Where, on Sunday night, they lost 3-0 against Real Madrid.

About this division not just being a place to play but a statement, meeting Madrid not just a match but a symbol: of survival, of overcoming, of never having abandoned, reclaiming a place.

He travelled sweetly, had the tactical speed to pick his way through the field in the straight and then a sharp turn of foot at the business end to put the race to bed a furlong out. In winning, he also picked up a “Golden Ticket” for “the race that stops the nation” in early November, one of just two such guaranteed entries on offer in the northern hemisphere.So what’s not to like? The answer, it soon transpired, is a small piece of metal inserted into one of Ethical Diamond’s legs. “He had a little fracture last year and we put a screw in,” Willie Mullins, the gelding’s trainer, said, “and they’re not allowed in Melbourne. It’s fair and their rules are there for a reason. At least we know we can’t go there before we leave.”Ethical Diamond shines in the Ebor as Mullins’ expansion on the Flat continuesRead moreWinning aMelbourne Cupis surely the most significant ambition left on Mullins’s to-do list now that he has won (and retained) the British trainers’ title over jumps, so the realisation that Ethical Diamond’s “Golden Ticket” is in effect worthless will have come as a blow.As he pointed out, though, he has at least been spared the expense and frustration endured by Aidan O’Brien in November 2024 when Jan Brueghel,the St Leger winnerand Melbourne Cup favourite, was scratched by the Australian vets a few days before the race.Quick GuideGreg Wood's Tuesday tipsShowRipon2.05 Triple Force 2.35 Schrodinger’s Cat 3.05 Hanney Girl 3.35 Kats Bob (nap) 4.05 Thats My Boy Luke 4.35 Queensland BoyMusselburgh2.20 Tardaff 2.50 Shes Got The Blues 3.20 Beaumadier 3.50 Temper Trap 4.20 Gesundheit 4.50 Naughty NiallLingfield4.10 Senor Cortez (nb) 4.40 Boss Lady 5.10 Galileo Charm 5.40 Pending Appeal 6.10 Harryella 6.40 Amber Honey 7.10 Saytarr 7.40 Phoenix MoonWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.O’Brien, who was in California for the Breeders’ Cup, was infuriated by the decision, as the result of what was described as a “shadow” on a scan. This, in the opinion of the local vets, meant that Jan Brueghel “was currently at heightened risk” of injury.“I would imagine that with any developing three-year-old at this time of the year, you would get shadows, and the same with human beings,” O’Brien said at the time. “It’s probably gone a little bit ridiculous but that’s the way it is.“One time when horses were trotted it was always the vet’s opinion whether they were sound or lame but now there’s an app on the phone and a phone video, and the phone tells the vet whether the horse is sound. There comes a time when it gets a little bit ridiculous.”View image in fullscreenAidan O’Brien’s Derby winner, Anthony Van Dyck, had to be put down at the Melbourne Cup in 2020.Photograph: Brett Holburt/RACING PHOTOS/AFP/Getty ImagesJan Brueghel was due to be O’Brien’s first Melbourne Cup runner since the introduction of heightened veterinary protocols for overseas competitors in 2021, a year after the same trainer’s Anthony Van Dyck, the Derby winner at Epsom in 2019, wasput down after sustaining a broken fetlock during the Cup. He was the sixth overseas runner to suffer a fatal injury in the race since 2013.There wasimmense pressure on the Australian racing authoritiesto act, and to be seen to act, after such a sustained run of fatal injuries, and they can point to four subsequent injury-free runnings of the Melbourne Cup as a sign that the policy is proving to be effective.Ron Turcotte, who rode Secretariat to Triple Crown glory, dies aged 84Read moreThe fans have also been returning to the country’s most famous race over the last two years, from a low point of 73,816 in 2022 to 84,492 a year later and then 91,168 in 2024. The Australian sporting public, it seems, is slowly learning to love its biggest race again.Four renewals of a single Flat race, though, is hardly conclusive evidence that the fatal injuries between 2013 and 2020 were down to anything more than a run of bad luck. And though the Australian authorities, perhaps, may not be too concerned, this year’s Melbourne Cup will be a poorer race without Ethical Diamond cashing his Golden Ticket.The treatment of Jan Brueghel, meanwhile, whose abortive trip cost about £120,000, is also a potential disincentive for international runners. Over time, it may be, as the League of Gentlemen might put it, a more local race for local people.There is a potential lesson here for British racing, which has faced similar pressures to “do something” several times in the fairly recent past after abnormal clusters of fatal injuries at Cheltenham or Aintree in the spring.View image in fullscreenJan Brueghel (left) won the St Leger last year but was then ruled out of the Melbourne Cup by vets after travelling all the way to Australia.Photograph: Mike Egerton/PASaturday marked the start of the fifth National Racehorse Week, which actually runs for nine days until 31 August giving members of the public a chance to go behind the scenes at racing yards, stud farms and retraining centres around the country.The initiative is part of a broad strategy around welfare issues, which has included the founding of the independently chaired Horse Welfare Board and the development of data-based risk models in partnership with the Royal Veterinary College.It is proactive, not reactive, and focused on the overall picture, which is the only sensible approach given that racing will always carry an element of risk and also how easy it is to be fooled by randomness when what are essentially very unlikely events suddenly occur in clusters.The fact that a likely favourite can in effect be ruled out of Australia’s biggest race on vets’ advice because different vets have successfully treated an injury in the past should be a reminder of the possible drawbacks of trying to micro-manage risk, when the risk itself – 31 deaths from 33,189 runners on the Flat in Britain in 2024 – is already extremely low.Explore more on these topicsMelbourne CupTalking HorsesHorse racingAustralia sportcommentShareReuse this content"

Photograph: Aston Villa FC/Getty ImagesMix of youth and experience bolsters hopes that Villa can build on encouraging start made under Natalia ArroyoBySophie DowneyMon 25 Aug 2025 19.01 EDTLast modified on Mon 25 Aug 2025 19.09 EDTShareGuardian writers’ predicted position:6th (NB: this is not necessarily Sophie Downey’s prediction but the average of our writers’ tips)Last season’s position:6thProspectsAston Villa will be aiming for a smoother Women’s Super League season, having spent much of the 2024-25 campaign flirting with relegation. There were strong signs, however, that the club had put the problems of Robert de Pauw’s tenure behind them with a comfortable sixth-place finish. An eye-catching final run saw them unbeaten in five games, scoring 16 in the process, including five against Arsenal.The four months under De Pauw had proved an unmitigated disaster and left Natalia Arroyo with a mountain to climb when she joined the club in January. Once safety had been secured, the Spaniard’s coaching principles started to shine and the team visibly grew in confidence. But with an ageing squad, there was always going to be some turnover and the departures of Jordan Nobbs, Danielle Turner and Rachel Corsie point to this fact. It was important for Arroyo to maintain a strong spine and Rachel Daly’s contract extension points to how valued her leadership and experience remains, while managing to keep Anna Patten, Kirsty Hanson and Lucy Parker indicates that Villa remains attractive for high-quality internationals.Arroyo has injected youth into her squad over the summer with the signings of Ellie Roebuck (25), Lynn Wilms (24), Océane Deslandes (25) and England Under-23 international Lucia Kendall, while bringing in Jill Baijings permanently from Bayern Munich was a notable coup. The Netherlands midfielder made a significant impact on loan last season, wearing the captain’s armband in the absence of Daly on several occasions.Villa have been building momentum in pre-season. A 2-0 defeat at Manchester United was followed by a 5-1 win over Liverpool and an impressive 1-1 draw away to Paris Saint-Germain. With a final friendy to come against Union Berlin, Arroyo’s side are looking to be in strong shape for theiropening match away at Brighton.Aston Villa’s league placing since 2021.Aston Villa’s league placing since 2021The managerView image in fullscreenNatalia Arroyo was a surprise appointment but has quickly put her stamp on Aston Villa.Photograph: Neville Williams/Aston Villa FC/Getty ImagesArroyo was probably not on many people’s radars when she signed a three-and-a-half year deal in January, but the 39-year-old has already proved to be one of Europe’s most promising coaches. After being forced to retire from playing through injury, Arroyo began her management career with Catalonia before joining Real Sociedad in 2020. Her four-year tenure at the club saw them finish runners-up in Liga F in the 2021-22 season. Arroyo likes her teams to be aggressive in the press and direct going forward, using the pace and energy of the likes of Hanson, Chasity Grant and Ebony Salmon to break defensive lines.Off-field pictureAston Villa became the latest club tooffload their women’s teamto help them avoid any breaches of the Premier League’s profitability and sustainability regulations. The deal saw a 90% stake in the women’s side sold to Villa’s parent company V Sports, which was founded by owners Wes Edens and Nassef Sawiris. A 10% stake was sold to external American investors. It follows Chelsea’s decision to do similar last year when the women’s arm of the club was sold to BlueCo for around £200m.Star signingLynn Wilms became the club’s first marquee signing of the summer, arriving after four seasons at Wolfsburg. The versatile Netherlands international can play at centre-back and right-back and brings plenty of Champions League experience. During her time in Germany, the 24-year-old made more than 100 appearances in all competitions for Wolfsburg, lifting the Frauen-Bundesliga title in 2021-2022 and picking up a Champions League runners-up medal in 2023. Wilms made her debut for the Netherlands at 18 and has featured in four major tournaments, including Euro 2025.Stepping upRachel Maltby is one of the most promising young players to have emerged from Aston Villa’s academy in recent years, and it has been an exciting 12 months for the 18-year-old defender. After finishing fourth with England at the under-17 World Cup last year, she signed her first professional deal with the club in March. Maltby proceeded to make her WSL debut at Villa Park in their 5-2 victory over Arsenal, coming on as a second-half substitute for Maz Pacheco. A dynamic player, she can play at full-back and wing-back on either side of the pitch and possesses plenty of attacking qualities.It was a good summer for …View image in fullscreenNoelle Maritz helped Switzerland reach the quarter-finals of Euro 2025 before being knocked out by Spain.Photograph: Image Photo Agency/Getty ImagesNoelle Maritz was an integral part of Switzerland’s historic run at this summer’s European Championship.

One of the elements that makes them so hard to beat is that beating them seems so inconceivable. Even when they hit a bad run, the expectation is always that at some point they will rediscover their form. To some extent,Manchester Citydid that last season. As miserable as much of the campaign was, after losing to Nottingham Forest at the beginning of March, they put together a run of 10 games unbeaten and ended up third – even if defeat to Crystal Palace in the FA Cup final demonstrated the shortcomings that remain.That game showcased City’s flatness at times going forward but also a strange openness at the back that was apparent again in the4-3 defeat to Al-Hilalin the Club World Cup. Pep Guardiola sides, given how high their line is, will always be susceptible to direct balls played in behind them if something goes awry with the press; it’s an inevitable part of the risk-reward of that style of play.Even in the 4-0 win over Wolves on the opening weekend, there were signs in the early stages of a potential weakness to that sort of tactic. It was just that flaw that led to Richarlison breaking the offside trap and crossing for Brennan Johnson to open the scoring forSpurs at the Etihad on Saturday. Spurs’s second goal, though, was just as worrying: goalkeeper James Trafford played an inexplicable pass to Nico González’s wrong foot under pressure at the top of his own box. It wasn’t an error of execution so much as one of conception. If it were a one-off, that might not necessarily be of too much concern, but it was very similar to an error Trafford made in Burnley’s defeat at Crystal Palace the season before last, leading to a red card for Josh Brownhill.Ederson was the perfect goalkeeper for Guardiola, being both good at the traditional aspects of goalkeeping and an exceptional passer of the ball. It’s perhaps an understated feature of Guardiola’s success how fortunate he has been in his goalkeepers: inheriting Víctor Valdés at Barcelona and Manuel Neuer at Bayern, then signing Ederson at City. While he, or City, deserve credit for identifying a talent like that from Benfica, it came after an error the previous season in replacing Joe Hart with Claudio Bravo.Although Ederson only turned 32 earlier this month, there was a sense last season that he was on the wane. There were, for instance, two big errors late in the first leg of the Champions League knockout tie against Real Madrid, and Guardiola preferred Stefan Ortega for certain games. Given his high wages and apparent desire for a big payday in Saudi Arabia, it’s perhaps no huge surprise that Ederson should be nearing the exit. What is surprising is the profile of players lined up to replace him.In terms of his passing, Ederson’s stats remained strong last season. Despite an average of 5.3 long balls per game, he still averaged over 86% pass completion, registering four assists. Trafford last season played 4.3 long balls per game in the championship – which at least in theory means he was playing more straightforward passes – yet his pass completion rate was just 70%. In thePremier Leaguethe season before, it was 62%, albeit with 6.5 long balls per game.City have reportedly agreed personal terms with Gianluigi Donnarumma, who has surprisingly found himself outside Luis Enrique’s plans at Paris Saint-Germain. Further negotiation is required on a fee, but this seems a strikingly odd move for City. Donnarumma is a fine shot-stopper and has made a habit of match-winning displays in the biggest games, but he has nothing like Ederson’s long-range passing. Although he had an 85% pass completion rate in Ligue 1 last season, that was with an average of only 2.6 long balls per game. That might suggest Guardiola is looking to go back to basics, to a shorter-passing, more possession-based style – but that would go against the recent trend both of his football and the wider game towards something less risk-averse and more direct.In fact, one of the features that stood out in the game against Wolves was how quickly City’s midfield tried to play the ball forward. Tijjani Reijnders, in particular, thrived. He was significantly less effective against Spurs, with a midfield that harassed him, gave him no space, and saw his pass completion drop from 88.3% to 81.4%.City have won only one of their last five at home against Spurs, so in that sense Saturday’s result was nothing unexpected. What it demonstrated, though, was that a team needs to do more than beat Wolves handsomely to prove it is back. Guardiola’s rebuild of City remains a work in progress.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Rod Wallace pounced on an Erik Thorstvedt error to score the first and Lee Chapman added a fifth from Cantona’s lay-off, but in between it was all about the Frenchman. First he volleyed in a misplaced clearance from Justin Edinburgh, then he headed home David Batty’s cross, before he added his third with another volley.But after a 4-0 defeat to Manchester City in November was followed by elimination from the League Cup by Watford, the manager Howard Wilkinson left Cantona out for a 3-0 win over Arsenal, offering as an excuse a fictitious groin strain. A furious Cantona demanded a transfer andsoon joined Manchester United. Wilkinson seemed almost relieved to be rid of a turbulent player, but it was Cantona who inspired Alex Ferguson’s Manchester United to their first league title in 26 years.This is an extract from Soccer with Jonathan Wilson, a weekly look from the Guardian US at the game in Europe and beyond.Subscribe for free here.Have a question for Jonathan?

The property is subject to the100% council tax premium on second homesthat was introduced in April, which she now pays in full.The Tories, including Cleverly, have accused the deputy prime minister of hypocrisy, pointing to her role in pushing through those tax rules and demanding clarity over whether she had been paying the premium and whether she claimed a single-person discount on her Admiralty House flat, the property that came with her ministerial position at the beginning of this year.Cleverly said: “She has admitted to paying the premium on her flat but she refuses to say whether she has been paying the second-homes premium on Admiralty House since it came into force in April.”But aLaboursource dismissed Cleverly’s criticism as political opportunism and called out his own record as a landlord. “James Cleverly has some brass neck,” a Labour source said. “Unlike him, Angela has never been a landlord or owned a property in London.“The second homes premium was introduced by the Tory government while James Cleverly was home secretary, and he supported it at every stage. Angela takes her council tax obligations seriously and she meets them in full.”A source close to Rayner said her housing arrangements reflected her job demands, not tax avoidance. They said the nature of her role meant she had often had to be in and around London for over a decade, but she had always rented a flat for that purpose, adding that she had actually ended the lease on her privately rented flat in London some months ago.Richard Holden, the shadow transport secretary, also weighed in to the attacks on Rayner, telling LBC: “I’ve got no issue with her doing well for herself at all. I think there are questions around hypocrisy at the moment, when she’s changing some of the tax measures around second home ownership and questions as to where she is delineating as her primary residence.”Some of Rayner’s allies found Holden’s intervention notable given his previous clashes with Rayner over her personal tax affairs, including his repeated calls for her to clarify historic capital gains tax payments.Rayner says Farage ‘failing young women’ with plan to scrap Online Safety ActRead moreIt has been pointed out by some privately that Holden voted for the measures allowing councils to double tax on second homes, under the Levelling-up and Regeneration Act, introduced by the Conservatives last year.Those rules were brought in to force by Rayner’s department in April.A Labour spokesperson defended the policy, saying: “We said we would introduce new powers for local communities and we have. That’s why councils can opt to add up to 100% to the council tax bills of second homes to help local leaders improve the sustainability of communities.“We are getting Britain building again after years of failure, pushing a planning bill through in the face of opposition from unelected Lords and landlords.“We are not in the business of restricting people’s ability to own property, but we’re clear that rights come with responsibilities.”Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

They added that the next series of the celebrity dance competition would begin on 20 September as planned.A statement from the Met said: “On Friday 22 August officers arrested a man in his 30s in east London on suspicion of rape and non-consensual intimate image abuse.“This is a joint investigation with Hertfordshire constabulary. The arrest follows a third-party allegation of sexual and drug-related offences.” The police urged anyone with any information to contact them, quoting 8479/22AUG, or Crimestoppers anonymously.Strictly Come Dancing was launched in 2004 and has been the BBC’s most notable weekend entertainment show ever since. The celebrity contestants for the next series wereannounced this month.The show has been hit by serious allegations about the behaviour of its performers in recent years. This month it was reported that the BBC had called in lawyers toinvestigate after claims that two of its stars used cocaine.The cocaine use allegations were reportedly made in a legal submission by the law firm Russells in March on behalf of the former contestant Wynne Evans, who was dropped by the BBC after apologising for using “inappropriate language” during the launch of the Strictly tour.It has been a difficult summer for the BBC. It has beencriticised for broadcasting the latest series of MasterChefwhich was filmed before its two presenters were sacked, and last month itadmitted that mistakes were made before and during a live Glastonbury broadcast of the punk duo Bob Vylanin which they chanted “death to the IDF”.Later in July an internal review found a BBC documentary about children in Gazabreached the corporation’s editorial guidelinesfor accuracy by failing to disclose its child narrator was the son of a Hamas official.Explore more on these topicsUK newsnewsShareReuse this content"

It then uses machine learning to recognise patterns that would be difficult for humans to detect.Currently, the disease is usually diagnosed using a mix of scans and biopsies, such as an ultrasound scan, a CT scan, a needle biopsy, a laparoscopy or surgery to remove tissue or possibly the ovaries.It is often detected late because symptoms such as bloating, feeling full quickly after eating or having to pee frequently are not always obvious potential signs of cancer.The blood test looks for what ovarian cancer sheds into the bloodstream, even in its early stages.Cancer cells release fragments into the blood that carry tiny, fat-like molecules known as lipids, along with certain proteins. This combination of lipids and proteins are like a biological fingerprint for ovarian cancer, according to AOA Dx, which developed the test.It also uses an algorithm that has been trained on thousands of patient samples to recognise subtle patterns across these lipids and proteins that signal ovarian cancer.The test can detect the disease “at early stages and with greater accuracy than current tools”, according to Alex Fisher, the chief operating officer and co-founder of AOA Dx.Dr Abigail McElhinny, the chief science officer at AOA Dx, added: “By using machine learning to combine multiple biomarker types, we’ve developed a diagnostic tool that detects ovarian cancer across the molecular complexity of the disease in sub-types and stages.“This platform offers a great opportunity to improve the early diagnosis of ovarian cancer, potentially resulting in better patient outcomes and lower costs to the healthcare system.”A study, led by the universities of Manchester and Colorado and published in the American Association of Cancer Research journal Cancer Research Communications, tested 832 samples using the AOA Dx platform.In samples from the University of Colorado, the test was able to accurately detect ovarian cancer across all stages of the disease 93% of the time, and 91% in the early stages.In samples from the University of Manchester, the test showed 92% accuracy at all stages and 88% accuracy in early stages.Emma Crosbie, a professor at the University of Manchester and an honorary consultant in gynaecological oncology at Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust, said: “AOA Dx’s platform has the potential to significantly improve patient care and outcomes for women diagnosed with ovarian cancer.“We are eager to continue advancing this important research through additional prospective trials to further validate and expand our understanding of how this could be integrated into existing healthcare systems.”Explore more on these topicsOvarian cancerCancer researchWomen's healthMedical researchnewsShareReuse this content"

Experts said the death toll may have been inflated by the upheaval at Fema, claiming it diminished its capacity to respond quickly.The letter, entitled The Katrina Declaration, accused theTrump administrationof disregarding the Post-Katrina Emergency Reform Act (PKERMA), passed in 2006 with the intention of absorbing the lessons of the disaster.“Hurricane Katrina was not just a natural disaster, but a man-made one,” the signatories wrote.“The inexperience of senior leaders and the profound failure by the federal government to deliver timely, unified, and effective aid to those in need left survivors to fend for themselves.“Two decades later, Fema is enacting processes and leadership structures that echo the conditions PKERMA was designed to prevent.”It is also scathing about Kristi Noem, who as homeland security secretary, has overall responsibility for Fema, and about two administrators who have been placed in charge of the agency since Trump’s inauguration.“Since January 2025, Fema has been under the leadership of individuals lacking legal qualifications, Senate approval, and the demonstrated background required of a Fema administrator,” the signatories said.The letter identifies the current Fema acting administrator, David Richardson, who has no previous experience in disaster management, and his predecessor, Cameron Hamilton, who was appointed by Trump only to be fired after publicly saying he opposed plans to abolish the agency.“Decisions made [by Noem, Richardson and Hamiltion] … hinder the swift execution of our mission, and dismiss experienced staff whose institutional knowledge and relationships are vital to ensure effective emergency management,” it said.Noem has angered seasoned officials by demanding that contracts worth more more than $100,000 be personally approved by her – a stipulation specialists say significantly slowed the response to the Texas floods.Richardson’s suitability was questioned after he told staff that he did not know the US had a hurricane season – which lasts from the start of May till 30 November. His office later insisted he was joking.The letter states: “Our shared commitment to our country, our oaths of office, and our mission of helping people before, during, and after disasters compel us to warn Congress and the American people of the cascading effects of decisions made by the current administration.”Six statements of opposition in the letter include condemnation of “the ongoing failure to appoint a qualified FEMA administrator, as required by law”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The department recently ordered Fema agents to assist Immigration, Customs and Enforcement (Ice) agents in immigration raids, threatening to fire those who refused.Trump, who has set up a review council headed by Noem to consider Fema’s future, has repeatedly said he favors its abolition, though he softened his rhetoric following the Texas floods, amid suggestions that it could be “rebranded” with more of its functions being devolved to the states.Thirty-six of the signatories – including some currently working at the agency – attached their names, leaving them open to possible retribution. Another 144 withheld their identities.One signatory,Michael Coen, a former Fema chief of staff under Joe Biden and Barack Obama, told the Guardian in a statement: “I am proud of the current and former FEMA employees for having the courage to speak up. Lessons were learned from Katrina and Congress took action. Those lessons and actions are being disregarded by the Trump administration.”Daniel Llargués, Fema’s acting press secretary, dismissed the criticisms voiced in the letter.“It is not surprising that some of the same bureaucrats who presided over decades of inefficiency are now objecting to reform,” he toldthe New York Times. He said the Trump administration “is committed to ensuring Fema delivers for the American people” and to cutting “red tape, inefficiency and outdated processes” in the agency.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationDonald TrumpUS politicsClimate crisisHurricane KatrinaHurricanesnewsShareReuse this content"

The impact is broadly comparable with the damage smoking, alcohol use, poor diet or limited exercise can have on health, the researchers said.Extreme temperatures are increasingly common owing to the climate crisis, potentially causing widespread and long-lasting damage to the health of billions, the scientists warned.The research represents a “paradigm shift” in the understanding of the extent and severity of heat’s impact on our health, which can be lifelong, according to one expert.It was already known that heatwaves cause short-term spikes in early deaths with, for example, almost600 premature deathslinked to a June heatwave in England. But the new analysis is one of the first to assess the longer-term impact.The researchers followed 25,000 people in Taiwan for 15 years and compared their exposure to heatwaves with their biological age, a measure of overall health. They found, for example, that biological age increased by about nine days for people who experienced four more heatwave days over a two-year period. Manual workers, who tend to spend more time outside, were strongly affected, with their biological age increasing by 33 days.While the increase in biological age may seem quite small, the scientists noted that this was only over a two-year period. They are investigating the impact of heatwaves on ageing over people’s entire lifetimes.The researchers also said that the total impact on populations around the world would be large, because everyone suffers during heatwaves, and higher biological age is a strong predictor of increased risk of death.“If heatwave exposure accumulates for several decades, the health impact will be much greater than we have reported,” said Dr Cui Guo, at the University of Hong Kong, who led the research. “Heatwaves are also becoming more frequent and lasting longer so the health impacts could be much greater [in the future].” Fossil fuel burning, the main cause of the climate crisis,reached record levels in 2024.Prof Paul Beggs, at Macquarie University in Sydney, Australia, and not part of the research team, said: “Many of us have experienced heatwaves and survived unscathed – or so we thought. [This research] now shows that exposure to heatwaves affects the rate at which we age.”He added: “In 2024, [scientists] discovered that early life heat exposurenegatively impacts brain white matter development in children. Coupled with the new finding that heatwave exposure accelerates ageing in adults, we have a paradigm shift in our comprehension of the extent and gravity of heat’s impact on our health. The impact can occur at any age and can be lifelong.”The new research,published in the journal Nature Climate Change, used the results of a series of medical tests, including blood pressure, inflammation, cholesterol, and lung, liver and kidney function, to determine the biological age of each person in the study. The researchers compared this with the actual age of each person to see if their exposure to heatwaves was linked to faster ageing.They found the total number of heatwave days experienced had the biggest impact on accelerated ageing. Why prolonged high temperatures cause faster ageing is not known, but damage to DNA is likely to be part of the reason.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

This suggests people were increasingly taking steps to cope with the heat, such as spending more time in the shade and using air conditioning where available.The 25,000 adults in the study were all part of a paid-for health management plan and were on average younger, healthier and more educated than the general population. Older and sicker people are more vulnerable to heat, so the impact on ageing is likely to be larger than found in the study.The study took into account people’s weight, smoking and exercise habits, and any pre-existing conditions such as diabetes and cancer, as well as the overall use of air conditioning in their neighbourhood. But data on potentially relevant factors such as time spent outdoors, coolness of housing and individual air conditioner use was not available, with the researchers saying further investigation was needed.Beggs said the results of the study were broadly consistent with those from a recent US study that showed outdoor heataccelerated ageing among older adults. Another US analysis, from 2023, found that “high exposure to extreme heat was associated withfaster cognitive declinefor [Black people] and residents of poor neighbourhoods”.Explore more on these topicsExtreme heatExtreme weatherAgeingClimate crisisHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

But our lives remain intertwined in incredible waysThe age of extinction is supported byAbout this contentHarriet RixMon 25 Aug 2025 01.00 EDTShareOnce upon a time there was a girl who lived in a tree. She had deep-set brown eyes and brown hair. She ate fruit – orange mangosteen and black juniper berries – crunched on nuts, sucked on sweet grasses and chewed juicy leaves, and dug up tubers and roots, knowing which ones were good, and which were hard or poisonous.Sometimes, she followed the trails that crisscrossed through the grass, but much of the time she clambered through the broad crowns of the trees, reaching up for branches and feeling the texture of the bark against her hands, balancing against the trunks and springing along boughs. At night she tucked herself into the fork of several branches and curled up to sleep, watching stars like diamonds and branches against the sky.One day, high up in the canopy, she slipped. She fell more than 40ft (12 metres) and hit the ground at more than 35mph (55km/h), feet first, then fell forwards on to her outstretched arms. The impact was too much, and her legs and pelvis shattered, as well as her arms and ribs. There was no medical help, and she died from her injuries in a couple of hours.Three million years laterin what is now Ethiopia, her fossilised bones were taken into an archaeological camp, where they were playing a Beatles song on repeat: Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds.View image in fullscreenA sculptor’s rendering of ‘Lucy’ – the 3.2m-year-old hominin whose fossilised remains were found in Ethiopia.Photograph: Dave Einsel/Getty ImagesBy 2016,Lucy One, as she was called, was an icon, and made a posthumous tour of American museums from her base in the museum in Addis Ababa. Scientists used an MRI machine to scan her bones, and reconstructed the breaks in them with the help of a trauma pathologist.View image in fullscreenThe fossils of Lucy. Their discovery in 1974 caused a sensation.Photograph: Fred HarterThey found that Lucy had complex compression fractures in her larger bones, and the smaller ones had broken in the “greenstick” manner, a half break, half-split often recorded in pathologist’s reports on children who have fallen out of trees. They put together a picture of how she might have fallen, and thus a famous fossil came alive.Some scientists have dismissed this as a just-so story, pointing to the fact that a 3.2m-year-old fossil will inevitably have breaks. So we can’t be certain about her death. But we can be pretty certain that she lived her life in trees. Lucy was famous because she was the first hominin known to have walked upright and straight-legged like a modern human.Her species, calledAustralopithecus afarensisafter the Afar area of Ethiopia where she was found, had adapted to walk upright for a good distance. Her kneecaps sat as they would on us, her pelvis was a similar shape to that of a modern woman. However, she also had hefty shoulders and strong arms for climbing and swinging, and she was almost certainly still sleeping in trees and using them to move around when she slipped.Cosseted in these protective tree-nests, primates could do something that is rare in the animal world: long, deep sleepHuman history, the human brain, the human hand and the human leg, all start in the forest canopy. Our ability to bounce along branches standing upright, our desire to build nests and smell cedar wood – all the adaptations of primates – are adaptations to trees. Binocular vision, with both our eyes pointing forwards, allows us to judge distances and map a way through the canopy.Standing upright you can reach a branch high above your head, and grip it with strong and flexible hands that have the perfect adaptation to smooth bark. Fingers backed by hard nails have fat and fluid-filled pads, allowing them to deform like a slightly deflated tyre to the shape of the branch and maximise surface area. Fingerprints, which we share via convergent evolution with the otherwise very distantly related koalas, channel away a film of water that might cover a branch, and interlock with rougher bark.High in the treetops, it is likely that our pre-human ancestors learned to build nests – weaving together branches into the messy, leafy structures that our closest relatives, chimpanzees, still create.View image in fullscreenLike chimpanzees, hominins probably slept in nests in trees.Photograph: Eric Baccega/NPL/AlamyCosseted in these protective tree-nests, primates could do something that is rare in the animal world: long, deep sleep. Sperm whales, floating like megaliths, sleep for up to half an hour at a time. Birds sleep with one eye open, employing the opposite half of their brain to watch for any predators. Monkeys that sleep sitting on branches wake every five minutes or so lest they fall off. But in a nest, both non-rapid eye movement (NREM) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep are possible for long periods. The result, broadly speaking, is brain development and dreams. Humans spend about 20% of the night in REM sleep, and it is during this time that we dream.Dreams are an invaluable way for another world to bolster the waking world. Freud famously interpreted them as a window into the unconscious mind, but recent research suggests that dreams are something more tangible than this, a way of re-enforcing your kinaesthetic memory, the memory that makes you reach for the branch in the right way and swing for the correct distance. Current thinking suggests that the little twitches made by your body in REM allow your brain to map precisely where in the body and the brain that twitch is happening.In other words, in REM we re-integrate our bodies, essential for an ape searching through a three-dimensional tree world for food, or bouncing along branches to flee a predator, and for an ape developing an idea of self-awareness. Asleep, we develop memories and maps, a shadow world that can map on to the real one, and at times expand it. Trees didn’t only shape our bodies; they enlarged and shaped our brains every single night we slept in them.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

But trees are chemical manipulators above all, using sun and time and carbon to make incredibly complex compounds, which are finely tuned through evolution to domesticate people.The cacao tree does so using theobromine, the active ingredient and distinctive taste in chocolate. Theobromine, like cocaine, caffeine and nicotine, has a mild but pleasurable effect on the nervous system, which makes it irresistible to primates. They get a psychoactive high, which allows them to swing through the canopy for miles.View image in fullscreenBy tempting the strongest primates – such as the Bornean orangutan – with fruit, trees are able to spread their seeds and pods far afield.Photograph: Tim  Laman/NPLThis is an essential trick for a tree that can only grow in specific niches that are scattered about the forest, often far from another of the same species. Ruthlessly, the trees select for larger monkeys able to travel further distances by using the toxicity of theobromine: just as chocolate can kill dogs, so too can a large dose knock off a small monkey. The trees grow large, heavy pods that can develop without breaking branches on the parts of the tree that can support the weight of larger monkeys. These large monkeys can eat the pods and turn the very high fat content of cocoa butter into the physical energy required to travel long distances, and the theobromine hit into mental energy to spread the seeds.Here, the tree uses extraordinary powers of chemical synthesis to manipulate animals it will use to travel. Chemically, physically and existentially, animals have been shaped by trees, and few have been more shaped by trees than humans. Whole societies have arranged themselves around trees.The striking relationship between the cacao tree and monkeys appears to have been seamlessly transferred into humans, even though our genetic paths parted from them 5m years ago. As a result of cacao domesticating humans, cacao trees currently grow everywhere in the world where they can survive, from south-east Mexico to the Philippines, Ivory Coast, Angola and India, and we plant them, nurse them and consistently destroy their competition and pathogens.How many more examples of trees shaping human behaviour, domesticating or taming us, are there? The soothing scent of a new book is a response to the smell of lignin in the paper, specifically a subunit, vanillin, that is also released into some whiskies aged in oak, and concentrated by the vanilla orchid, which grows on trees. Unlike most orchids, which have seeds dispersed by the wind, both bees and animals disperse vanilla – one reason for its extremely wide distribution. The smell of cupcakes and books can be traced back to the appeal of our woody nests.View image in fullscreenChemically, physically and existentially, animals have been shaped by trees, and few have been more shaped by trees than humans.Photograph: Michael Honegger/AlamySince we came down from the trees we have been learning how to manage without them – how to replace them in our lives. Sometimes it can feel as though we are now separated from trees; that, although they shaped us once, we can do without them in our bodies and our lives. But our lives remain intertwined. The links remain in unlikely places: it is too easy to think of trees as passive because we cannot see what they are doing. Victims, because we can take a chainsaw and clear a hillside of them. Still, crime reporters flocked to the trial of those who cut down theSycamore Gap tree in Northumberland. Does our aesthetic appreciation of trees incline us to preserve them? Have trees in some way, indeed, cultivated that aesthetic sense?Trees have profound agency over earth, wind, fire and water in ways we can only partly elucidate. Scientifically, trees are full of surprises. To try to apply physical laws to them is to invite disaster – there are so many species with their own peculiarities, and own laws of behaviour. Defining them chemically is equally risky – we will never catch up with the new compounds they invent while we sleep. Classifying them genetically is a slippery business. An occasional glimpse of root in a cave roof, the taste of an unusual fruit or a mirage-like cluster of palm trees in the desert, gives us a glimpse of the living unknown; a life form that shaped the world we grew into, that wove it around us into a peaceful form, but is still largely incomprehensible. And yet, when we reach out to grasp a branch, it fits into our hand.This is an edited extract from The Genius of Trees by Harriet Rix, published by Vintage (£25).Order your copy atguardianbookshop.com.Explore more on these topicsTrees and forestsThe age of extinctionEvolutionBiologyAnthropologyextractsShareReuse this content"

But, he adds, “we cannot do it the way our fathers did.”Boutaris is determined to keep producing in the region and keep the family business going but says “the curve is not looking good” as the climate crisis puts pressure on producers across the Mediterranean.Boutaris, who heads the Kir-Yianni wine producers’ group, is one of thousands of farmers in the south of Europe battling to continue producing on the lands their ancestors have farmed for decades, or even centuries, as increasingly extreme weather, such asthis summer’s wildfires, rage across Spain, France and Greece.Brazil issues last-ditch plea for countries to submit climate plans ahead of Cop30Read moreTheir struggles mean the price of wine, olives, citrus fruits and vegetables are expected to continue to rise, as droughts, flash floods and high temperatures affect traditional crops in the Mediterranean.View image in fullscreenStellios Boutaris has said he is determined to show that farming can still work in southern Europe.Photograph: Kir-Yianni EstateBoutaris is employing new tactics to tackle the problem, including installing irrigation and water storage and planting more vegetation among the vines to help the land hold more water and keep temperatures down. He is also buying higher land and seeking out different varieties of grapes which are more resilient to extreme weather.He has just invested €250,000 (£216,000) in irrigation and now plans to spend a further €200,000 (£173,000) on a project for 40 hectares of vineyards in Santorini.Producers acrossEuropewill be forced to pass on such extra costs to consumers, in the form of higher prices, he argues. “Cheap wine is not going to be easy to find. It used to be that the south of France, Spain and Greece produced cheap wine of Europe. Now it is going to be very difficult to compete on price,” he says.Shoppers are already feeling the effects, as droughts in Spain, Italy and Portugal, where the UK sources much of its fresh fruit and vegetables during autumn and winter, push up prices this summer, at a time when prices would usually fall.This summer even farmers in parts of the UK have beenhit by long dry spellsaffecting production of cereals, potatoes, carrots and broccoli, which are not usually irrigated.Things are expected to get far worse as a result of the climate crisis. In the EU, the average annual loss for crops is forecast to increase by up to two-thirds by 2050 to as much as €24.8bn, according to analysis by the European Investment Bank (EIB) and the European Commission.By 2050, the most severe increase in drought risk is expected in Spain, Italy and Greece with more than nine times as many days of severe drought conditions each year compared to 1990 under theIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s“middle of the road” projections.France, Italy, Spain and Romania are likely to see the largest absolute increases in crop losses – with average annual losses expected to increase by 64%, or more than €1bn (£866m), with drought a major factor, according to the EIB and commission’s report.In 2022, for example, maize yields were down 24% on the previous year across Europe with Spain bearing the largest proportion of losses followed by France, Italy and Romania.View image in fullscreenEnglish vineyards are seeing investment as more temperate areas struggle.Photograph: NyetimberDr Peter Alexander, a professor of global food systems at the University of Edinburgh, says it is already possible to see the northern march of crops within Europe, with champagne producers investing in the UK and maize growing in Scotland.British farmers are experimenting with crops such as haricot beans and chickpeas, which historically have been difficult to grow, in the hope that they may thrive in a warming climate. One farmer in Essex has even planted more than 1,000 olive trees with support from Belazu, the premium olive oil company.However, the more the climate crisis progresses the harder it becomes to adapt and the more costly it becomes. Alexander says this effect is already evident in more exotic crops, which require very specific growing conditions and are now under pressure, such as coffee and cocoa. “In high income countries they are available but less affordable,” he says.In southern Europe, family-owned farms are struggling to find the resources to fund adaptation to keep growing.“Already what we see is groves get abandoned and people can’t afford to be farmers any more,” says Sarah Vachon of the Citizens of Soil olive oil brand, which works with independent producers around the Mediterranean.She says farmers are looking at many ways to keep going, from irrigation to new varieties but “these are big investments for small farmers already living on the bread line and these things are difficult to get government funding for”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

But in order to conserve water, first it has to rain. We have had winter rains this year, but in the previous three years it has been a virtual drought.”With concerns about future supplies, Filippo Berio has invested in storage tanks to hold an extra 3,000 tonnes of oil in the past five years and temporarily rented space for 1,000 more, as well as turning to a wider array of sources for olive oil, including Latin America.Lambert van Horen, an analyst at Rabobank, says the financial group is predicting that there will be no increase in agricultural production per hectare in Europe in the coming five years, ending decades of improvement aided by increased efficiency and better fertiliser.However, that means higher prices. “In the last five years prices of fresh produce have kept up with inflation or have been even higher than general inflation. In the next five years we expect food again to at least follow general inflation,” he says.“Farmers will get higher prices and they need that because their inputs are getting more expensive.”That could involve building more shade houses or greenhouses where temperatures and water flows can be more controlled, whatever the climate, to building more storage.“There will be more costs because adaptation, especially when crops are not so valuable such as grains where the revenue per hectare is relatively low,” says van Horen.In Greece so far it has been a decent year for many wine producers after two tough years. Still, with wildfires raging, many small farmers are considering their futures.Boutaris is determined to carry on: “There has got to be a way to do it and I want to show it can be done.”Explore more on these topicsFarmingClimate crisisEuropefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Their collaboration on The Wind That Shakes the Barley, about the Irish war of independence, won the Palme d’Or at Cannes.There have been hundreds of individual and mass arrests of people attending rallies referencing Palestine Action across the UK since the ban on the group came into force on 5 July, after a high court judge refused to grant the group’s co-founder Huda Ammori an injunction suspending it while a judicial review was pending.Yvette Cooper, the home secretary, announced the ban days after activists from the group broke into RAF Brize Norton and defaced two military aircraft with spray paint.Police in London are braced for further arrests after Defend Our Juries, the pressure group leading protests against the ban, called for more than 1,000 people to sign up for its next demonstration to be held in London on 6 September.Earlier this month, 532 people were arrested at the largest demonstration so far relating to Palestine Action since it was proscribed.Last week, the former Labour cabinet minister Peter Hain said the UK government was “digging itself into a hole” over Palestine Action and that fellow Labour peers and MPs were regretting voting to ban the group.In an article for the Guardian, co-written with Labour MP Stella Creasy, the pair wrote: “The status quo has come to mean equating peaceful witness with terrorism, and isn’t sustainable. But neither is pretending there isn’t a problem that threatens our ability to debate, disagree and ultimately decide in our democracy.”Explore more on these topicsUK newsnewsShareReuse this content"

As a result, it gave too little to smaller private businesses, particularly surrounding pay and representation for women.That resulted in the ONS consistently underestimating the gender pay gap by a “small but noteworthy” margin of one percentage point, the research paper said.The research paper’s lead author, Prof John Forth from the Bayes Business School at City St George’s, University of London, said the data collected in this annual survey “has far-reaching consequences across our society, informing everything from official pay recommendations for doctors and nurses to anti-poverty measures like the national minimum wage. It is, therefore, crucial that the data is a true representation of wages and earnings in modern Britain.”The flawed data may have influenced key pay decisions. The Ashe survey is used by the Low Pay Commission to monitor the impact of the minimum wage, and by the Office for the Pay Review Bodies to help determine public sector pay settlements. It is the latest blow to the ONS, which has struggled withmounting problemsthat have forced it to delay or cancel several of its releases in recent monthsThe ONS did not immediately respond to the Guardian’s request for comment but told the Financial Times that the survey’s sampling and weighting was under review and that the agency had improved its approach to the survey since 2024 in a way that would address some of the issues raised in the report.“Weighting schemes are just one aspect of the methodology of a complex survey such as Ashe, and we regularly scrutinise these methods to ensure they continue to be relevant and aligned to best practice,” the ONS added.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

His legal team has argued that thecase should be thrown out,citing a technical error in how the charge was brought.Ó hAnnaidh was greeted byhundreds of supportersas he arrived at Westminster magistrates court for a hearing recently.When the charge was first announced earlier this year,Kneecapdescribed it as “political policing” and a “carnival of distraction” and vowed to “vehemently defend ourselves”.While their US tour dates have been cancelled, the band said on Monday that they had an upcoming surprise for US fans.“We will be sharing something very special for US fans next week so that we can still link with you all in October,” it reads. “It’s top secret for now, but all will be revealed next week.”The group confirmed that their planned Canadian shows in Vancouver and Toronto will still proceed as planned.The Belfast-based group – known for their political performances and outspoken support for Palestine – madeheadlinesin June during their Glastonbury set, where they led chants saying “fuck Keir Starmer,” referring to the UK prime minister.In April, the rap trio also made headlines fordisplaying statementsagainst Israel’s military campaign in Gaza at the Coachella festival.Explore more on these topicsKneecapEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

The move follows pressure from the US president, Donald Trump, to cut medication prices for Americans.Eli Lilly has said the NHS will be shielded from the price rise, but with few people eligible for access through the health service, most purchase Mounjaro privately. One month’s supply of the highest dose costs about £200 through many online pharmacies and is now expected to go up.Henry Gregg, the chief executive of the National Pharmacy Association (NPA), said the rising cost of Mounjaro had caused understandable concern to patients and pharmacies alike.“We’d urge patients to avoid bulk ordering Mounjaro as well as buying the medication at massively reduced prices,” he said.“Bulk ordering can have a significant impact on supply and pose a potential risk to patient safety. We’d also urge patients to avoid unlicensed sellers, who may be selling fake medication or medication that does not meet UK safety standards.“Instead, we’d encourage them to speak to their prescriber, who can support them with any concerns they may have and provide them with the safe care they need.”Many readers have contacted the Guardian to say they are devastated by the price rise, with some already stocking up on Mounjaro amid fears they will be unable to afford the new prices.Rose*, 48, from Suffolk began taking Mounjaro in October 2024. She has since lost about 2.5 stone (15.9kg) and no longer experiences constant thoughts about food.Rose currently pays £202 a month for the maximum maintenance dose of 15mg a week and said she was horrified by the price hike.“When I saw that, my heart just dropped, because I thought: ‘Oh gosh, how am I going to be able to justify the expense?’ Are there other things that maybe I need to cut back on to be able to then afford this additional cost?” she said, adding she currently had enough Mounjaro for another eight weeks and had ordered a further month’s supply.The impending Mounjaro price rise has led to some online pharmacies reporting a surge in interest in Wegovy – a cheaper but less effective weight-loss jab produced by the Danish pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk, who said it “currently have no plans of changing our offering in the UK”.People using drug Mounjaro sustain weight loss over three years, trial findsRead moreGraham Thoms, the chief executive of Pharmadoctor, a provider of clinical service packages to pharmacists, said Mounjaro accounted for 98% of all weight loss treatments provided by its nationwide network of partner pharmacies, adding the company had been inundated with queries from both pharmacists and patients who were equally concerned about the pending price increases.“The main query we are receiving from pharmacists is asking Pharmadoctor for guidance how to safely switch patients from Mounjaro to Wegovy should Mounjaro become price inhibited for patients,” he said, adding pharmacists had also been asking whether or not they could provide patients with several months’ supply of Mounjaro at the same time so that they could keep the price down.“Our response is that would not be clinically appropriate,” said Thoms, noting patients needed to have face-to-face consultations every four weeks to ensure the medication remained right for them, review goals and receive wraparound support.However, Thoms suggested the Mounjaro price rise might not be as drastic as the latest announcement suggested, noting his company’s partner pharmacists had been invited by their wholesalers or Lilly to participate in a rebate scheme.“We understand from those discussions that our partner pharmacies will need to purchase Mounjaro at the new higher prices from September, but will be able to claim back a rebate at the end of the month so long as they pass on the discount to patients,” he said.One online pharmacy, Chemist4U, has warned against microdosing with Mounjaro – a trend found on social media sites such as TikTok – noting it can undermine treatment and raise the risk of infections.The company said it is urging patients who are concerned about affording their treatment journey to switch to Wegovy, noting it saw a 5,000% increase in Mounjaro prescription requests over the weekend the price rise was announced and a 1,500% increase in patients switching to Wegovy.‘Gutted’: UK users of weight loss jab Mounjaro devastated by planned price hikeRead moreBut Sukhi Basra, who runs a pharmacy in Victoria in central London and is the vice-chair of the NPA, said patients could not simply jump from one drug to another.She said her biggest concern was around patients that were very stable or halfway through their weight-loss journey, adding many had benefited mentally, psychologically, physically and emotionally.“I know with some of my patients, [who] were already struggling with the current prices, that it would be really difficult for them to then, at such short notice, to be able to implement or budget for those kind of changes,” she said. “They’ve benefited from the medication, but they don’t necessarily sit in the remit of the NHS patients that are funded for it, because obviously, the NHS can’t fund for everything.”*Some names have been changed.Explore more on these topicsUK newsPharmaceuticals industryDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

It is a matter of the survival of our state, the image of our nation, and each and every family.”Bayrou said France was going through a “decisive moment”. If the government secured a majority in the confidence vote, it would be confirmed, he said, but “if it does not have a majority, the government will fall”.Early reactions suggested the centrist prime minister could well lose his gamble, toppling a government that was formed only last December after the premature collapse of his predecessor Michel Barnier’s even shorter-lived administration.The leader of the opposition party National Rally (RN), Jordan Bardella, said his far-right party would “never vote in favour of a government whose decisions are making the French suffer”. Bayrou had in effect announced “the end of his government”, he said.Manuel Bompard of the radical left Unbowed France (LFI) said: “The chips are down, and it is up to everyone to stake out their position clearly.” His party’s deputies “will vote on 8 September to bring down the government”, Bompard said.The Green party leader, Marine Tondelier, said on social media her parliamentary group would also vote against the government, as did the Communist party (PCF). Tondelier said Bayrou’s announcement amounted “de facto to a resignation”.Olivier Faure, the leader of the centre-left Socialist party (PS), also said it would vote against the government. Bayrou had “chosen to go”, Faure said, adding that it was “unimaginable” that PS or any other opposition party would vote for him.Bayrou acknowledged that the vote was a gamble. “Yes, it’s risky – but it’s even riskier not to do anything,” he told a press conference. France’s budget deficit hit 5.8% of GDP last year, nearly double the official EU limit of 3%.Opposition leaders said that if the government did fall, they would demand the dissolution of parliament and new elections. Bardella said: “Our fellow citizens are waiting for a change and a return to the ballot box: we are ready.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He was initially booked on suspicion of misdemeanor obstructing an officer on Friday.The musician later on Monday pleaded not guilty in a court appearance, the district attorney’s office said.Police said officers found the 26-year-old walking naked on Ventura Boulevard, a major thoroughfare in the Studio City neighborhood, shortly before 6am on Friday,They say he charged at the officers when confronted and was arrested. Police, suspecting a possible overdose, took him to a hospital where he spent several hours before being taken to jail, where he has remained since.He was being held on $75,000 bail, conditional on attending drug treatment. It’s not immediately clear whether he had posted it and been released yet. A message to his attorneys was not immediately answered.But one of them, Christy O’Connor, told a judgeLil Nas Xhas led a “remarkable” life that has included winning two Grammy awards.“Assuming the allegations here are true, this is an absolute aberration in this person’s life,” O’Connor said in court, according to NBC. “Nothing like this has ever happened to him.”The charges were first reported by TMZ.The rapper and singer from Atlanta is best known for his huge hit from 2018, Old Town Road, which merged country and hip-hop. It spent a record 19 weeks at No 1 on the Billboard Hot 100.Known for his genre-bending, innovating sounds and style, his first full studio album, 2021’s Montero, went to No 2 on the Billboard album chart and was nominated for a Grammy for album of the year.Explore more on these topicsLil Nas XLos AngelesRapnewsShareReuse this content"

The lawsuit, filed in a Texas court on Monday, accuses the companies of “a conspiracy to monopolize the markets for smartphones and generative AI chatbots”.Musk had earlier this monththreatened to sueApple and OpenAI, which makes ChatGPT, after claiming that Apple was “making it impossible” for any other AI companies to reach the top spot on its app store. Musk’s xAI makes the Grok chatbot, which has struggled to become as prominent as ChatGPT.Musk’s lawsuit challenges a key partnership between Apple and OpenAI that wasannounced last year,in which the device maker integrated OpenAI’s artificial intelligence capabilities into its operating systems. In claiming that their agreement “locked up markets”, Musk’s case is seeking to undo one of Apple’s most significant forays into AI and a marquee deal for OpenAI.“Defendants entered an unlawful agreement and conspiracy to leverage Apple’s monopoly power in the US smartphone market to maintain OpenAI’s monopoly power in generative AI chatbots,” the complaint states. It is also seeking to “recover billions in damages”.OpenAI rejected Musk’s allegations and framed the suit as part of his broader attacks against the company. “This latest filing is consistent with Mr Musk’s ongoing pattern of harassment,” an OpenAI spokesperson said.Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The lawsuit is the latest front in theongoing feudbetween Musk and Altman. The two tech billionaires founded OpenAI together in 2015, but have since had an increasingly public falling out which has frequently turned litigious.Musk left OpenAI after proposing to take over the company in 2018, and has since filed multiple lawsuits against the company over its plans to shift into a for-profit enterprise. Altman and OpenAI have rejected Musk’s criticisms and framed him as a petty, vindictive former partner.“We’re sad that it’s come to this with someone whom we’ve deeply admired – someone who inspired us to aim higher, then told us we would fail, started a competitor, and then sued us when we started making meaningful progress towards OpenAI’s mission without him,” OpenAI posted in a statement last year, following one of Musk’s lawsuits.The spat between Altman and Musk resurged earlier this month after the latter’s threat to sue Apple. Musk’s claims that Apple was manipulating the app store’s rankings to exclude other AI companies resulted in an exchange of posts between the two tech moguls challenging and insulting each other.“This is a remarkable claim given what I have heard alleged that Elon does to manipulate X to benefit himself and his own companies and harm his competitors and people he doesn’t like,” Altman posted in response to Musk’s claims that Apple was favoring OpenAI.OpenAI is currentlyeyeing a $500bn valuation, which would make it the most valuable privately held company, exceeding Musk’s SpaceX rocket maker which is the current title holder, at $350bn.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

In casting terms, this is a Borg-McEnroe 10-set tie-break leading to play being suspended even as the leads bring every microlitre of their technique to the game.They play Ivy and Theo, two high-achieving professionals whose marriage becomes a black-comic Chornobyl of toxic hate; it is adapted from the 1981 novel The War of the Roses by Warren Adler, which was previously filmed in 1989 with Kathleen Turner and Michael Douglas. Tony McNamara writes this new version and the director is Jay Roach, known for Austin Powers and Meet the Parents. Colman and Cumberbatch are acting black-belts and they are never anything other than watchable, but as they shout and wince and snap and zing their way through the dialogue, it’s difficult to believe that they really love each other; and then later really hate each other. The film loses its nerve on this latter point.The new version keeps a little more of the novel, in the sense that Ivy is supposed to be a brilliant chef, but it upends some of the original’s classic divorce talking points about a woman sacrificing her career for family and the husband’s professional status, and also therefore the traditional acrimony about who gets to keep the house. In this movie, Theo is an architect, not a lawyer, whose career collapses along with his most famous building and he becomes the househusband looking after the kids while Ivy becomes a globally celebrated foodie; she comes to despise her husband’s resentful beta-male loser identity and his ungrateful attitude when she bankrolls his designs for a new hi-tech family home.Weirdly, this sophisticated English guy is supposed to be fanatically coaching the kids in athletic prowess so they leave home early, in their mid-teens, not for college, but for some cloudily imagined sports institution. The children need to be got out of the way so the grownups’ battle can kick off, of course, but this is a peculiar and unconvincing contrivance, maybe there to position the couple as younger than in the original. (Surely people like this would have their eyes on Ivy League glory?)‘Love is great. But then one of you will be dog-tired and doing the bins’: Benedict Cumberbatch and Olivia Colman on how to survive a marriageRead moreThere are, of course, some nice lines. Theo says sadly: “When we were younger, I knew what she was going to say before she said it. Now I don’t know what she’s said after she’s said it.” There is a lot of angry acting and a fair bit of drunk acting; at one stage, Theo gets plastered on a flight to New York, to Ivy’s aghast embarrassment, and then she gets drunk in New York, finally throwing up in the bath, to Theo’s icy resentment. The difference is between loser-drunk and winner-drunk, but it doesn’t exactly test the range of these brilliant actors. Their friends Barry and Amy are played in supporting roles by Andy Samberg and Kate McKinnon, great comic performers who don’t get much funny material.Ncuti Gatwaplays a sous chef in Ivy’s cafe and Alison Janney is her formidably aggressive divorce lawyer.The movie has a high gloss and sheen, like something by Nancy Meyers, which creates a diverting disconnect, yet it flinches from the recognisable, tragicomic reality of a bad marriage.The Roses is out on 28 August in Australia and 29 August in the UK and US.Explore more on these topicsFilmOlivia ColmanBenedict CumberbatchDrama filmsRomance filmsComedy filmsFilm adaptationsreviewsShareReuse this content"

Austin Butler stars as ex-baseball-player Hank Thompson who gets mixed up in the seedy underbelly of crime in 90s New York.29 AugustThe RosesBenedict Cumberbatch and Olivia Colman star in this new version of the acrid satire of marital breakdown last filmed in 1989 asThe War of the Roseswith Michael Douglas and Kathleen Turner and audiences will be keen to see if this new movie matches its predecessor’s devastating final shot. Certainly Cumberbatch and Colman look like an A-lister clash.29 AugustYoung MothersView image in fullscreenAn assertion of hope … Young MothersPhotograph: Christine PlenusAn amazing return to form for the Belgian veteran masters of classic social-realism the Dardenne brothers. The movie follows the lives of teen mothers and mothers-to-be at a state home – gentleness, compassion and love are the keynotes of this quietly outstanding movie. The straightforward assertion of hope through giving and asking for help is powerful.29 AugustLittle Trouble GirlsThis elegant and mysterious debut picture from Slovenian director Urška Djukić reinvents the cliched idea of a Catholic girl’s sexual awakening: an all-girl teenage choir is under the thumb of a demanding and charismatic choirmaster, who isn’t above humiliating girls if they displease him in any way.29 AugustSpinal Tap II: The End ContinuesView image in fullscreenElton John, Christopher Guest, Harry Shearer, and Michael McKean in Spinal Tap II: The End Continues.Photograph: Bleecker Street & Authorized Spinal TapBefore there was Ricky Gervais, before there was Steve Carell … there was the rock colossusSpinal Tap, whose 1980s comeback tour was famously the subject of a documentary, or … if you will … well, you know how it goes. Now a sequel reunites us with the band, in their mature and reflective silver years, still rocking hard and finding that sex-positivity has brought them back into fashion. What’s wrong with being sexy?12 SeptemberA Big Bold Beautiful JourneyThe Korean auteur with thenom de cinémaKogonada (his actual name is as closely guarded as Elena Ferrante’s in the literary world) takes a big swing with this romantic drama about two strangers – played by Margot Robbie and Colin Farrell – who unite after an extraordinary journey. In the hands of anyone else it could be slushy, but Kogonada has a light and expert touch.19 SeptemberView image in fullscreenPaul Thomas Anderson returns … Regina Hall in One Battle After Another.Photograph: TCD/Prod.DB/AlamyOne Battle After AnotherFor movie-hipsters and superfans this is the big one. Director Paul Thomas Anderson returns with a movie inspired by Thomas Pynchon’s 1990 novel Vineland, another black comic riff on the war on drugs, the war on terror, the paranoid style of American politics and much else. Leonardo DiCaprio and Sean Penn star as two ex-revolutionaries trying to save the former’s daughter, played by Chase Infiniti.26 SeptemberHimA drama on classic underdog sports movie lines: Tyriq Withers plays Cameron, a promising but callow young American football player who gets the chance to train with the charismatic quarterback Isaiah White – a serious role for comedy veteran Marlon Wayans – and the experience is unnerving. Jordan Peele produces.3 OctoberThe Smashing MachineOne of the Safdie brothers – Benny – goes solo directing this true-life sports movie, inspired by the 2002 HBO documentary of the same title, starring Dwayne Johnson as the humungous MMA fighter Mark Kerr and Emily Blunt as his wife, Dawn. The action will surely show that the hero is more than just a machine.3 OctoberView image in fullscreenSmart and compassionate … Urchin.Photograph: Devisio Pictures and Somesuch/BFI Film/BBC/Tricky KnotUrchinBritish actor Harris Dickinson makes a really impressive directorial debut with Urchin, a smart and compassionate picture about homelessness: engaging, humorous and sympathetically acted by Frank Dillane as Mike, a guy who has been on the streets for five years. Intelligent and heartbreakingly vulnerable.3 OctoberRoofmanJeffrey Manchester was a former US army reserve soldier who became a pop-culture antihero in the 1990s for robbing branches of McDonald’s by breaking in through the roof – for which he was dubbed the “roofman” – and then waiting in the lavatories for opening time, at which point he would storm out and empty the cash registers. Channing Tatum plays Jeffrey and Derek Cianfrance directs.17 OctoberGood FortuneView image in fullscreenDeadpan style … Keanu Reeves as Gabriel and Sandra Oh as Martha in Good Fortune.Photograph: Eddy Chen/LionsgateIn this trading-places comedy, Keanu Reeves brings his imitable unreadable deadpan style to the role of Gabriel, a “budget” angel who intervenes in the lives of lesser humans with mixed results. Writer-director Aziz Ansari stars as a stressed gig worker Arj, insecurely employed by Seth Rogen’s heartless plutocrat. Gabriel swaps their existences to show Arj that money isn’t everything. Or, actually, is it?17 OctoberAfter the HuntA #MeToo story of American academe from screenwriter Nora Garrett and director Luca Guadagnino. Julia Roberts stars as an Ivy League professor Alma Olsson who is put under pressure when her friend and colleague, played by Andrew Garfield, is accused of sexual assault. Ayo Edebiri plays Alma’s star pupil Maggie.22 OctoberA House of DynamiteA big, brassy, real-time apocalypse scenario from action specialist Kathryn Bigelow, whose title may remind you of Sam Goldwyn’s apocryphal remark in 1945: “This atom bomb … it’s dynamite!” Idris Elba and Rebecca Ferguson star in a white-knuckle drama set in the White House as officials deal with what appears to be an incoming nuclear missile attack.24 OctoberSpringsteen: Deliver Me from NowhereView image in fullscreenBlue collar energy … Jeremy Allen White as Bruce Springsteen.Photograph: 20th Century StudiosPlaying a living icon is always tricky, and rock icon trickier still. Jeremy Allen White brings the blue-collar energy to take on the role ofBruce Springsteen, as he made his 1982 album Nebraska. Stephen Graham plays Bruce’s father, Douglas, and Jeremy Strong is Springsteen’s manager and producer Jon Landau.24 OctoberThe MastermindPossibly the most downbeat – and yet intriguing and hilarious – heist movie in history. Josh O’Connor stars as James, the art school dropout in 1960s Massachusetts who conceives a plan to rob the local art gallery with the help of tough guys that he has bizarrely recruited. Director Kelly Reichardt makes of him a rather Updikean figure who ends up on the run from the consequences of his own actions.24 OctoberBugoniaThe Onion joked that Greek auteur Yorgos Lanthimos now estimates he’s only three films away from hanging with Emma Stone outside work. His latest film brings him nearer to that goal. It’s a remake of the South Korean sci-fi comedy Save the Green Planet! in which Stone stars as the CEO of a drugs company who is kidnapped by two men who believe that she is a hostile alien.31 OctoberThe Running ManView image in fullscreenThriller-satire … Glen Powell in The Running Man.Photograph: Capital Pictures/AlamyA dystopian thriller-satire on the classic theme of TV being evil, directed by Edgar Wright and based on the 1982 novel by Stephen King – last filmed in 1987 with Arnold Schwarzenegger in the lead. Now the star is slightly less jacked: Glen Powell is Ben, a guy who takes part in a TV reality show in which he is chased across the world by guys out to kill him – and there’s a big cash prize if he can survive 30 days.7 NovemberThe Thing With FeathersA drama about grief, taken from the novella by Max Porter whose title modifies the Emily Dickinson quotation about hope.Benedict Cumberbatchplays a guy who, along with his two sons, has to deal with the terrible loss of his wife and their mother. Grief appears in the guise of a Ted Hughes-style crow.7 NovemberThe ChoralAn original screenplay by Alan Bennett has to be something to savour. Nicholas Hytner directs and Ralph Fiennes stars in the second notable choirmaster film of 2025: he is Dr Guthrie – who, in a small Yorkshire town in 1916, where most of the menfolk are absent, has to recruit a choir of young boys and girls to sing Elgar’s The Dream of Gerontius. Their innocence and the beauty of the music make a fierce contrast to the war’s horror.7 NovemberTrain DreamsView image in fullscreenFragile masculinity … Felicity Jones with Joel Edgerton in Train Dreams.Photograph: Adolpho VelosoBased on the novella by Denis Johnson and directed by Clint Bentley (who recently made the much-lovedSing Sing), this is a drama about fragile masculinity. Joel Edgerton plays Robert, a railway worker whose life is secluded, vulnerable and lonely, as he spends so much time away from his wife but is poignantly aware of the beauty of the American landscape in which he finds himself.7 NovemberKeeperActor and film-maker Osgood Perkins had a breakthrough last year with his strange horror thrillerLonglegsand now he returns with another scary movie. Tatiana Maslany and Rossif Sutherland play Liz and Malcolm, a couple who escape for a cosy romantic getaway at … uh, oh … a secluded cabin. When Malcolm has to return briefly to the city to sort out some business, Liz finds herself alone with a terrible evil.14 NovemberNurembergIt is the beefy, lairy role that Russell Crowe was surely born to play. He is the Nazis’ Luftwaffe commander Hermann Göring in this tense postwar psychological drama, and Rami Malek plays Douglas Kelley, the US army psychiatrist tasked with examining and questioning Göring to see if he was fit to stand trial at Nuremberg. An unsettling battle of wits ensues.14 NovemberJay KellyView image in fullscreenFellini-esque journey … George Clooney as Jay Kelly.Photograph: Peter Mountain/NetflixGeorge Clooney is a Hollywood legend with old-school class who commands a lot of affection – and who could also use a hit. Perhaps this will be the one. The director and co-writer is Noah Baumbach, working with Emily Mortimer, and Clooney plays a superhandsome movie megastar of a certain age, with Adam Sandler as his agent, as they make a somewhat Fellini-esque journey across Europe surrounded by a carnival of fans.14 NovemberDie, My LoveLynne Ramsay brings the gothic-realist steam heat to this ferocious and blazingly visual study of a woman, played by Jennifer Lawrence with the passionate commitment reminiscent of Gena Rowlands, and her descent into bipolar disorder as she is left alone all day with a new baby in a rambling Montana house. Robert Pattinson plays her husband and Sissy Spacek is her stressed mother-in-law.14 NovemberBlue MoonView image in fullscreenMargaret Qualley and Ethan Hawke in Blue Moon.Photograph: Sabrina Lantos/Sony Pictures ClassicsSome fascinating casting here as Ethan Hawke plays the great lyricist Lorenz Hart, struggling with depression and alcoholism in 1943 (an era when these disorders were heartlessly described as being a maudlin drunk) and we see poor Hart at the opening night of Oklahoma!, which his former partner Richard Rodgers has written with a new collaborator: Oscar Hammerstein. He stumbles out early and we see him in the bar trying and failing to come to terms with what this obvious hit says about his own future.14 NovemberWicked: For GoodThe public and the pundits gave a thumbs up to thefirst partof this mighty screen adaptation of the stage musical Wicked (imagining the origin story of the Wicked Witch from The Wizard of Oz) and now in this second part we are reunited with Cynthia Erivo’s Elphaba and Ariana Grande’s Glinda – and also Jonathan Bailey’s hilarious Prince Fiyero.21 NovemberPillionView image in fullscreenUproarious … Harry Melling and Alexander Skarsgård in Pillion.Photograph: Element Pictures/BBC Film/BFIIt’s high time author Adam Mars-Jones had a presence in British cinema and here is an uproarious and tender adaptation of his novella Box Hill, a queer BDSM tale of biker romance and devotion with something of Alan Bennett, Tom of Finland and Wallace and Gromit. Alexander Skarsgård is the leather-clad alpha male Ray who likes the submissive style of Harry Melling’s sweet-natured Colin, and their relationship takes an unusual course.28 NovemberAvatar: Fire and AshJames Cameron’s Avatar movies are sometimes set to be gigantically successful while leaving no trace in the collective memory. If this new one is going to do the same thing, it’s going to take its time about it – this weighs in at three hours and 12 minutes. Sam Worthington and Zoe Saldaña return as Jake and Neytiri, who must struggle for survival in a changing world.19 DecemberMarty SupremeHere is the solo film from the other Safdie brother – Josh – and it’s another real-life sports movie, set in 1950s New York and starring Timothée Chalamet as the US ping pong champ Martin “Marty” Reisman, known as the Needle for his slight, feathery build. Safdie has tempted Gwyneth Paltrow away from her semi-retirement to play Marty’s love interest.26 December"

The result is a show that’s not only eccentric and funny, but an utterly delightful meditation on the importance of food and care and community, featuring a very hungry animal.Seamus is a disabled bull who lives with palsy; when he was born he was considered too sick to live, but was saved by an animal rescuer, his “mum” BJ, who also pops up through the show. For months Seamus couldn’t even stand up or lift his head to feed, and as a result, quickly became enamoured with “human” food – and in large amounts.“All the farmers around here were laughing and taking bets on how long I can keep him alive,” recalls BJ.Cooking for Seamus was created by a laconic folk musician named Archer who now cares for Seamus and takes feeding him seriously. The pair live in a leaky caravan out near Castlemaine in Victoria, on a creek surrounded by other rescued animals, including Seamus’s best friend, a goat named Lillian.What happened to Alex Lloyd? His Australian Story episode is a tremendous act of braveryRead more“I believe he has one of the most advanced palates in the history of the world,” Archer says, as part of the explanation of why he’s created an entire cooking show for his animal friend. Seamus, via Archer, rates his meals out of 10; after Seamus eats his meal, licking his chops with his ears flicking, Archer will watch him intently, trying to gauge whether the meal was a hit for its discerning critic. “I reckon he’s in the 9s, maybe a 9.2” Archer decides, after Seamus chows down a bucket of pumpkin penne pasta.Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morningEach episode, ranging between five and 20 digestible minutes, typically centres on a celebrity chef coming to cook a meal for Seamus – like the American musician Martha Spencer, who not only cooks a huge helping of Appalachian cornbread and pinto beans for Seamus, but spends much of the episode singing songs to an audience of rescue animals. Other guests include comedian and YouTube chefNats What I Reckon, whose laid-back approach to cooking is a spiritual match to the docuseries.“What do you think of food critics?” asks Archer. “Not much,” drawls Nat.View image in fullscreenYouTube chef, comedian and mental health advocate Nathan Bartolo of Nat’s What I Reckon cooks pasta for Seamus.Photograph: Matthew WalkerProbably my favourite guest was the legendary performer Kamahl, who explains that he doesn’t really like cooking and instead feeds Seamus 27 bananas while wearing a golden cape and reciting counterculture poetry.If it sounds funny, it’s meant to – everyone involved has a good understanding of the humour of the entire situation. There’s a recurring shot of Seamus being called for dinner and gently rolling down the hill in excitement.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSaved for LaterFree newsletterCatch up on the fun stuff with Guardian Australia's culture and lifestyle rundown of pop culture, trends and tipsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It’s also a beautiful snapshot of how rewarding it is to care for a rescued animal and devote your life to them.Obviously Cooking for Seamus bears little resemblance to other cooking shows on TV – for one thing, it’s doubtful that anyone would be watching this hoping to learn how to cook the recipes that Seamus is eating, unless they also have a bull to cook for or perhaps a gaggle of children happy to eat out of a trough. It’s not that the food looks bad (in fact, it often looks amazing) but it’s not delivered in a step-by-step fashion designed to instruct.Instead, Cooking for Seamus explores the more important side of cooking. The love that Archer, BJ and everyone on the show has for Seamus is palpable. As humorous as the idea of him being a “food critic” is, we often make food for those we love, to show them that we love them. And Seamus returns this love, too; my favourite shots are where he gratefully rests his giant head against Archer, a move immediately recognisable to me with my own rescue animal, a traumatised ex-racing greyhound named Basil.It is a nice reminder that good food doesn’t require frills or Michelin stars – just enough care to show our love.Cooking for Seamusis available to watch on YouTube.

When Smith’s Mike warns that they’re cops, one of the carjackers dismisses him – “Well, I’m a standup comedian, and I suck” – as if speaking for an audience unconvinced that these two comic personalities could plausibly exist in their new roles.An elbow to the head and kick to the groin later – Smith and Lawrence making a trope-y takedown appear convincingly cool – leaves that same doubter laid flat, looking up at Will Smith as he calmly points a gun at him (and the audience) while responding: “Now, let’s hear one of them jokes, bitch.”For any kid like myself weaned on Martin and Fresh Prince – for whom the latter especially would dictate our fashion sense and goofball sensibilities – that moment landed like an exhilarating coming-of-age. Our household icon just graduated to badass movie-star status, even growing his baby mustache into a goatee, while basking in the golden hues director Michael Bay, in his feature-film debut, would bathe him in. It’s a feeling I first experienced as a 13-year-old sneaking into a very R-rated movie on opening day, and relive every time I revisit Bad Boys – whether in whole or just the part when Smith’s sprinting through Miami streets in slow motion, his shirt open to reveal a glistening Adonis-like physique.Sure, Bad Boys is riddled with cliches and groaners. It’s a formulaic action movie about two narcotics detectives hunting down heroin stolen from their own precinct. They have to role-play as each other because of a contrived plot device involving a witness (Téa Leoni, also fabulous) whose desperate demands set up the duplicity. But Smith and Lawrence make all the flaws go down easy, needling each other with their hilarious rapport, while Leoni easily holds her own against the comic stars.Bay elevates the material with his high-adrenaline opulence. The director’s swooping slow-motion camera work and operatic low-angle shots of action heroes as gods would reach parodic levels in follow-up movies like The Island, Transformers and even Bad Boys II. But in his first time out, Bay’s bombastic aesthetic (with some shots and production design elements lifted from his music video for Meatloaf’s I’ll Do Anything for Love) was an exciting calling card for a director who would later be referred to as a vulgar auteur. Who else would stage a splashy bathroom brawl, where heads are smashed into urinals, with gothic romantic candlelight?‘I luxuriate in the weird details’: why Highlander is my feelgood movieRead moreInstead of drowning out his stars with this maximalism, Bay’s style instead puts them on a pedestal. That feels especially ground-breaking since this was the rare studio action movie at the time starring not one but two Black leads.Before Bad Boys, buddy-cop movies favored the tempered chocolate-and-vanilla pairings of 48 Hrs. (Eddie Murphy and Nick Nolte), Lethal Weapon (Danny Glover and Mel Gibson) and The Last Boy Scout (Damon Wayans and Bruce Willis). That wouldn’t have worked for a premise, originally conceived as a comedy for SNL stars Dana Carvey and Jon Lovitz, where the two stars have to swap identities.Casting both Smith and Lawrence, and giving them the room to make the movie completely their own, set the stage for an action movie with distinct swagger, transcending the way Black-led movies at the time were pigeonholed as strictly for “urban” audiences. The hip-hop, R&B and dancehall on the soundtrack added to that sensation, pairing tracks from 2Pac, Warren G, Babyface, Diana King and Ini Kamoze with Mark Mancina’s adrenaline rush of a score (that man went hard on those strings!).Lawrence and Smith clearly understood what it meant for them to step up to these roles, and take up that rarified space, which is why throughout Bad Boys they keep paying homage to those who came before them. “Wesley Snipes, Passenger 57!” Lawrence yells out in that opening announcing their arrival, following that up with comically timed shout-outs to Shaft, Action Jackson and Jim Brown, the former football star who starred in The Dirty Dozen and 100 Rifles.These were the Black action heroes that Smith and Lawrence grew up with, just as we would grow up with them.Bad Boys is available to rent digitally in the US, on Now/Sky in the UK and Netflix in AustraliaExplore more on these topicsWill SmithMy feelgood movieAction and adventure filmsComedy filmsThrillersComedyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The film begins at the former Wendover air force base in Utah, where fighter-bomber practice runs were held before the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945. Moving through the corridors of a museum erected to commemorate the mission, the roving camera takes in various artefacts, including replicas of the two atomic bombs, Little Boy and Fat Man. Circulating through various monitors and speakers, matter-of-fact narration of these events lingers in the air, lending an omnipresent eeriness. Here lies empty nostalgia, unnervingly entombed.The ecological devastation thatsurrounds the Salton Sea, a testing site for the Manhattan Project, tells a different story. What looks like sand is, in fact, the crushed remains of former vegetation and aquatic life. As water levels rapidly recede, toxic waste piles up, with hazardous health effects for local residents. Most poignantly, the film reminds us that this region is, first and foremost, Native American land; close by is the Torres Martinez desert, where the Indigenous Cahuilla tribe was once nearly wiped out by a smallpox epidemic engineered by white settlers. Now, their descendants have formed a close alliance with undocumented migrant workers from south of the border, also victims of state violence.Testimonials from various interviewees are dextrously entwined with poetic shots of shifting landscapes, which range from closeups of environmental ruins to bird’s-eye views of arid soil. This interplay transforms these images into depositories of oral histories and lived experiences; these stories of exploitation, loss and Indigenous pain might not find a home in the official records, but they live on in this passionate documentary.Among the Palms the Bomb is on True Story from 29 August.Explore more on these topicsFilmDocumentary filmsUS militaryreviewsShareReuse this content"

We wrote the song after watching the Frank Sinatra film’Interviews byDave SimpsonMon 25 Aug 2025 10.26 EDTLast modified on Mon 25 Aug 2025 11.19 EDTShareRobert Hodgens, AKA Bobby Bluebell, songwriter, guitar, vocalsI first glimpsed Siobhan Fahey at my publisher’s offices. Later that day, when I was being interviewed by Smash Hits, I told the interviewer: “I really fancy Siobhan from Bananarama.” The next night, she was at our concert, at the front. I remember saying to my bandmates Ken and Dave McCluskey: “I’m gonna get off with her.”We met in the car park and liked each other. Soon afterwards, I moved down from Glasgow – into a London flat with the glamorous Bananarama girls. It was like the Beatles in Help! One night, we were lying in bed watching the Frank Sinatra film Young at Heart, one of my dad’s favourites, and talking about our backgrounds. Siobhan is Irish but her father was in the British army, so she’d moved around and changed schools a lot. I think she had just wanted to escape, so we started writing lyrics about how her parents had got married young to have sex and have kids, because that’s what people did then. It was the first time since I’d left home that I also realised what our parents had done for us, which fed into the line: “How come I love them now? How come I love them more? / When all I wanted to do when I was old was to walk out the door?”Bananarama recorded Young at Heart, but their version didn’t quite have whatever their big hits had at the time. Our record company boss Roger Ames suggested the Bluebells record it. We were big pals with Dexys Midnight Runners so thought of asking Helen O’Hara, who played fiddle on Come on Eileen, to play on our version. Roger said that would be “too much cross-pollination”, but the old story about us finding a fiddle player in the pub isn’t true – Bobby Valentino, who played on the single, was a session-player who laid the part down in a few minutes, and Lawrence Donegan came up with a killer new bassline.In 1984, the song got to No 8 but then nine years later it was used on a car advert and it spent four weeks at No 1. The pope actually complained that the lyrics promoted divorce, which I thought was really funny – although my mum is Italian so she wasn’t best pleased.Siobhan Fahey,songwriterBob’s Smash Hits story is sheer fantasy and makes me sound like a stalker – but Bananarama did share offices in Covent Garden with the Bluebells. We were penniless and on the dole, so we’d go in there to use the phones or steal toilet roll. I met Bob there. He was – and is – the most charming, positive and inspiring person, so he sweet-talked his way into my affections and I took to him big time.View image in fullscreen‘An amazing time to be young’ … Siobhan Fahey and Bobby Bluebell.Bananarama had been living in a leaky loft space above the Sex Pistols’ rehearsal room, although we were all in a council flat when Bob used to come down and stay in my room. We weren’t long out of school, we were practically children, but it was an incredible time to be in London. We’d go dancing in the Wag Club and everyone there was in a band: Wham!, Culture Club, Sade.Once Bananarama started having hits, we had to disguise ourselves to sign on for the dole in case they’d seen us on Top of the Pops. Then suddenly we needed material for an album. I remember Bob sitting with a guitar and going: “Let’s write a song.” He came up with the title Young at Heart after we watched the film, then I started writing lyrics about my relationship with my parents. You can hear the difference between our personalities in the song. My words reek with pain, his are more loving: two very different experiences of growing up.Bananarama recorded Young at Heart as a northern soul stomper. We’d wanted Soft Cell’s producer but were told he only did synth bands, so instead we ended up with Barry Blue. It’s a flawed production but I like our version, although it doesn’t have the fiddle hook, which is so important to the Bluebells’ one. The song’s mix of dark and cheery lyrics with uptempo, uplifting music reminds me of Tamla Motown, which was the reason we formed a girl group. It was such an amazing time to be young, and we were two kids who wrote a song about our parents from the heart.The Bluebells’ 1984 debut Sisters is out now as an extended remastered double album/3CD/DVD setExplore more on these topicsPop and rockHow we madefeaturesShareReuse this content"

That means it’s time for more visiting orchestras. The Leipzig Gewandhaus and the Melbourne Symphony are among this week’s arrivals. But the past weekend belonged to the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra. No visit by Amsterdam’s finest is to be missed, but these two Proms in less than 24 hours brought something more – the starry presence ofKlaus Mäkelä, who becomes the RCO’s chief conductor in 2027 and who currently has the musical world at his feet.The obvious challenge in judging whether the two will become a perfect fit is that the RCO are simply so good. The warmth and precision of the Amsterdam string sound is legendary, while the RCO offers listeners wind playing to die for. So strong is the squad that, like a top football club, many principals who played in the visit’s first concert of Berio and Mahler were rotated in the second, consisting of Mozart, Prokofiev and Bartók.View image in fullscreenPlaying to die for… Klaus Mäkelä conducts the Royal Concertgebouw orchestra at the BBC Proms.Photograph: Chris Christodoulou/BBCBut Mäkelä is himself a Galáctico signing and the hall was duly packed. Still only 29, he brought two big works – Mahler’s fifth symphony in the first concert and Bartok’s Concerto for Orchestra in the second – not forgetting a truly thrilling Kodály encore to close with. The big pieces were fabulously played, of course, but it was the instrumental details rather than the overall conception that made the biggest mark. There was too little sense of symphonic architecture in Mäkelä’s approach to the Mahler, while his Bartók emphasised the work’s showpiece qualities at the expense of the sense of distance and loneliness that haunts the score.Mahler, though, is in the RCO’s blood. The composer himself conducted this orchestra. Decades later, Bernard Haitink’s Amsterdam Mahler performances became legendary. Mäkelä’s relentless approach had little in common with Haitink’s more measured tread, nor withMark Elder’s cerebral takeon the same symphony in last year’s Proms. From the expertly phrased funeral march trumpet call onwards, wind playing was exceptional, as were quieter passages more generally. The strings caressed the Adagietto’s lingering phrases and Mäkelä brought fine swagger and propulsion to the rondo-finale. As an interpretation, though, it never quite established itself.Unexpectedly, Luciano Berio’s Rendering, which preceded the Mahler, fared better. This substantial three-movement piece feeds some of Schubert’s late symphonic sketches through Berio’s fertile and ingenious late 20th-century sensibility. The result, especially when it is as well done as it was here, is fresh and exploratory, as Schubertian melodies modulate into Berio’s mysterious fragments and colours. If the test of a good performance is that it stays in the head, then this one did just that.The same was true ofJanine Jansen’s account of Prokofiev’s first violin concerto on the following day. Jansen commanded the performance, her playing technically dazzling and musically intense, with Mäkelä and the RCO providing impeccably unobtrusive accompaniment.Finally, hats off to Mäkelä for opening the second concert with an elegantly played example of something that has become too much of aPromsrarity in recent years – a Mozart symphony, in this case the D major “Paris”.Listen again on BBC Soundsuntil 12 October.

One hair is “OK, acceptable”, more is evidence that she has been “having it off”, he says, unaware that he uses these delusions of her infidelity to protect himself from the dangers of intimacy. A high-flying Fulbright scholar becomes a sex worker to avenge the father she hates. An ex-nun discovers that her decades of religious seclusion were driven by an unconscious fear of pregnancy. A troubled young woman, seeking redress for her psychological losses, steals large sums of money that she will never spend.In Love’s Labour, the London-based, American-born psychoanalyst Stephen Grosz offers an antidote to the pat, sanitised love stories we absorb through romcoms, reality TV shows and other popular culture. Often, he writes, “easy stories obscure the hard ones”, and the hard ones are most true. “I like older guys”, the kleptomaniac tells him, an explanation that conceals: “I want a man to be the mother I never had.” In Grosz’s telling, psychoanalysis resembles a painstaking, collaborative act of excavation, removing layers of self-deception and motivated reasoning to discover the conflicting fears and desires that lie beneath.Love’s Labour is Grosz’s second book and like his bestselling 2013 debut, The Examined Life, it is a series of case studies that read like Grimms’ fairytales: dark and allegorical. His patients’ identifying details have been removed, but one imagines the pube-counting professor and others will recognise themselves. That these strange life stories are true(ish), makes them all the more powerful and compelling. The title refers to Grosz’s belief that the work of love is to learn to see oneself and others clearly – which is also the work of psychoanalysis and, arguably, of life.The book is as much about the mysteries of analysis as it about the mysteries of our hearts and sexual desires. In one chapter, Grosz recounts a fierce argument between two psychoanalysts after one, Susan, discovers that the other, Cora, has been having an affair with her husband. Susan says that Cora has never learned what psychoanalysis should be about: having empathy, behaving morally, accepting reality. But Cora believes the goal is learning to act according to one’s true desires and accept the consequences. Both outcomes, Grosz concludes, can be desirable consequences of analysis, but neither should be the aim of the therapist. To have aims for a patient is to infringe on their autonomy. He aims for nothing more than for his patients to better understand themselves.As one might expect, therapeutic breakthroughs often happen after Grosz and the patient analyse a dream, and his patients frequently trace the origins of their issues with intimacy to early childhood, to a dead or emotionally absent parent. Each case study can feel like a detective story: a tiny, inconsequential detail may, sometimes years later, unlock a new understanding. And what a long time this process can take! Grosz has been working with patients for 40 years, and sometimes a phone call or chance encounter decades after the initial consultation completely changes his understanding of a person’s predicament. In the penultimate chapter – a pure horror story: chilling, moving, unforgettable – he describes a sculptor who has found himself emotionally and physically stuck since his girlfriend’s suicide. After they have been speaking for 10 years, Tobias recounts a dream that finally enables him to reveal horrifying details about the aftermath of her death, details that help them both understand his emptiness, and that will haunt readers long after they have set this book aside.“To see the light, you have to go down into the dark,” Grosz writes. His patients often learn that pain or darkness cannot be avoided: to love fully one must accept the reality of loss, to live fully one must accept the reality of death. What a privilege it must be to accompany another person so closely as they try to figure out the challenge of living – of change and love, and accepting love and change. And what a privilege it is for the reader to catch a glimpse of this process.Love’s Labour by Stephen Grosz is published by Vintage (£18.99).

Its follow-up, Kataraina, she has called “a breath out”. It continues that first novel’s themes of intergenerational trauma and violence within a largely Māori community based around the town of Kaikourā, on the east coast of New Zealand’s South Island. Auē won multiple awards in New Zealand and became an international bestseller; while Kataraina fleshes out its backstory, it can also be read as a thrillingly immersive standalone.The main focus of this new novel is a minor character from Auē, Aunty Kat, the maternal aunt of brothers Ari and Taukiri whose story was covered in the previous book. Almost erased by domestic abuse in Auē, here she is accorded her full name, Kataraina Te Au, and a narrative that swings back and forth from her birth in 1981 to the present: early January 2020. Kataraina, the only surviving sibling of three, with a brother dead through gang warfare and a sister believed drowned, has been in a coma in hospital following a beating from her partner, Stuart Johnson. Stuart was then shot dead by Beth, the young daughter of Kat’s childhood friend, neighbour, and – most recently – lover, Tom Aiken. This episode formed the dramatic climax of Auē.When the swamp finally disgorges its secrets, a female water spirit rises to the surface along with actual human remainsSince the killing of Stuart, a stretch of water on his property, owned (or rather appropriated) by his family for decades and known locally as Johnson’s Swamp, is fast increasing in shape and size, for no logical reason. “The land had been septic,” according to Tom. “Johnsons spent more than a bloody century draining it. Like, man, let it be. All around was humped and hollowed, except this bit in the middle that seemed to, well, seemed – excuse this poetry shit again – to slip into chaos. It’s hard to describe, but just looking at the ground made you feel confused, like you were looking at something you shouldn’t be looking at.”This “septic” aspect colours the history of the swamp and its part in the various incidents that shape Kataraina’s story and that of herwhānau(family). The ugly reality of coercive control thrums through the generations, from the unspoken violence meted out to Katarina’s beloved Nanny Liz by her husband, Jack, to Kat’s own situation with Stuart. Yet Nanny Liz is also an emblem of resistance to Kat. Aged 15, sneaking out to meet a marriedPakehā(white New Zealander) – her fisher father’s boss – Kataraina borrows a coat from her grandmother as psychological protection: “Nanny Liz’s faux-fur jacket watched like a cat”.Each of the book’s chapter headings refers to Stuart’s death, suspended through history: “many years after the girl shot the man”, “one day before the girl shoots the man” and so on, until “the moment the girl shot the man”. It is interweaved with the much older tale of a young Māori woman’s encounter with a British mercenary at the swamp while gathering spearmint, a cataclysmic event that echoes through each chapter. It is relayed polyphonically, as if occurring simultaneously in the past and the present, with information given incrementally. “Our ancestor once lived close to the house where he was shot. She was at the river when a man approached her with some peaches from a can, but then he attacked her.” The woman fights back.This incident is integral to Tom’s assertion that the swamp contains “something you shouldn’t be looking at”, as a group of environmental scientists in the present day investigate its mysterious swelling. The land is viewed, to some extent, astapu(sacred). Cairo, one of the scientists, recalls how her friendship with colleague Hana came about: “over a cigarette on a beach, which Hana … had only brought with her because she fantasised about smoking a tobacco pipe or cigarillo in Ōkarito, like Kerewin. Turned out they’d both read The Bone People before going there; art informed their work,whakapapainformed their work.” This exchange (whakapapais essential to Māori genealogy and ties together history, culture, identity and the land) is crucial to the context of the book and to New Zealand (Aotearoa in Maōri) literature more generally. Kerewin is the chief protagonist of Keri Hulme’s 1984 Booker prize-winning novelThe Bone People: Manawatu is, like Hulme and also Cairo and Hana, of Māori heritage. Her writing is often compared to Hulme, both in its subject matter and its free-associative structure.Manawatu’s blend of myth, legend and direct ancestry is unforced; when the swamp finally disgorges its secrets, the corporeal fuses with the supernatural. Ataniwhaor female water spirit, by turns malignant and benign, rises to the surface along with actual human remains. Vengeance seethes and simmers. Yet this is far from an unearthly or fey novel, but one rooted in materiality: food and laughter, fear and sex. “We burst from the trees, we were always bursting from the trees,” reflect two of the characters. An unstoppable life force dominates Kataraina: both the person and the novel.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

No surprise, then, that the most powerful moments in Sadie Pearson’s play are when actor Merida Beasley interrupts the male-dominated action to deliver impassioned and graphic accounts of violence against women.That she is credited only as “Woman” is not an oversight. It is an ironic comment on her invisibility. As far as hate-fuelled comedian Rodney Black (Ben Willows) is concerned, she could be anyone. Whether one-night stand or admin assistant, he will not even ask her name.She and women like her are the ones who suffer the consequences of Black’s onstage rants. He and his agent (Bertie Taylor-Smith) see his routines as edgy and provocative, testing the limits of social consensus in the name of artistic freedom. In truth, they are little more than incitements to violence. When a male fan takes him at his word and murders a stranger, Black’s career hangs in the balance.In this way, Pearson makes the connection between men having a laugh and women being safe. Black’s material is not merely a thought experiment and his success is not merely a symptom of a culture letting off steam. The attitudes he promotes have real-world consequences.These are weighty themes that require sensitive handling, but too often in Hen Ryan’s production, the playwright appears not to be in control of the demons she raises. Black, despite an anachronistic commitment to hand-writing letters to his fans, is one-dimensionally loathsome. In the absence of charm or laughs, he offers only bile. His agent is even more blunt in his lust for success.Compared with the many real-life comedians who play to the lowest common denominator, Black lacks the comic chops to be anything but offensive. A well-intentioned play ends up wallowing in the very thing it is trying to challenge.AtGilded Balloon Patter House, Edinburgh, until 25 August.

The former rock festival is a post-GCSE rite of passage, a place for many to don a daft hat, wear as little as possible, toast results or drown sorrows. Two years ago, Szmeriek – imagine the Streets’ Mike Skinner with a ’tache and trackies – was a special needs teacher before becoming a dazzling wordsmith, so draws on his backstory (and gets another cheer) when he tells the kid in the front row who failed all his exams: “It doesn’t matter. You will be someone.”Other hits include Skye Newman’s raw soul, dance producerSammy Virjiand besuited, sunglasses-wearing New York one-man electronic bandHarrison SmithAKA the Dare, whose brilliantly jerky set is like watching Jarvis Cocker fronting LCD Soundsystem. Kids waiting for rap at the main stage look bewildered by Amy Taylor’s raucous, shouty Aussie punks Amyl and the Sniffers. Trippie Redd’s affecting blend of the plaintive and unsettling is beautifully illustrated when a father plays football with his toddlers as the American raps about putting someone in their casket. Otherwise, with fewer stages and big names than previous years, the first day feels somewhat undersold and underpowered. US rap superstar Travis Scott’s headlining set builds in intensity as pyro and fireworks erupt around him, but ends abruptly 35 minutes early, without explanation, to a smattering of boos.Saturday is visibly busier and while co-headlinerChappell Roanis second on the bill here (she topped it in Reading on Sunday, alternating with Hozier) she pulls by far the biggest crowd all weekend, a sea of pink cowboy hats. Continuing her rapid ascent since 2023’sThe Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess, the American singer-songwriter is sensational. With a fantasy castle stage set, outfit like an Andy Warhol take on Elizabethan England and female musicians reminiscent of Prince’s band, subjects from LGBTQ+ issues to feminism to meltdowns are channelled into joyous, stylish, era-defining anthems. Few artists have owned the field so effectively in years. Irish singer-songwriter Hozier has to follow that, but the crowd stay put and his cosier vibe explodes into fire when he speaks up for Kneecap, Palestine and equality, and closes with a blazing Take Me to Church.View image in fullscreenThe demonic commander … Oli Sykes of Bring Me the Horizon performing at Leeds festival.Photograph: Katja Ogrin/Redferns for ABASunday is rock day, and Sheffield pop-metal kingsBring Me the Horizondeliver a postmodern eye- and ear-melter of a headline set where the band are stars in their own gigantic video game. Singer Oli Sykes is the demonic commander and the arm-swaying crowd and circle pits become part of the spectacle. Overall, though, it bodes well to see so many triumphs from newer artists, particularly Wunderhorse, who have gone off like a rocket since playing the BBC Introducing stage here last year and pack the hi-tech, usually dance-focused Chevron stage. For all the obvious echoes of Nirvana and REM, the Cornwall-based band’s undefinable edge – not least in wiry frontman Jacob Slater – makes them utterly compelling, and they enrapture an audience of all ages.Explore more on these topicsReading and Leeds festivalPop and rockChappell RoanAmyl and the SniffersTravis ScottBring Me the HorizonFestivalslive music reviewsShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Norman Harris’s career as a guitar dealer went stratospheric one day in 1973, when he received a phone call from a friend. “He said he was with someone who needed a Les Paul,” recalls the man who runs what is probably the world’s most famous guitar shop. “But he wouldn’t tell me who it was. I went over to meet them and it was just my friend there. I said: ‘You made me ride all the way down here? You made it sound so important.’ And then in walkedGeorge Harrisonwith Mal Evans.” Evans was the Beatles’ former road manager. They had been next door getting pizza.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.The business founded in 1975 by Harris – or Norm as he is known to his starry regulars, awestruck window-shoppers and legions of viewers ofhis YouTube channel– has grown exponentially. It is located on a strip mall in the Tarzana neighbourhood of Los Angeles, alongside a McDonald’s and a nail bar. It would be easy to blink and miss Norman’s Rare Guitars, unaware of a clientele that includes Slash, Billy Corgan, Dave Grohl, Kiefer Sutherland, Melissa Etheridge and Beck dropping by to check out the high-end stock, alongside parents buying instruments for their kids – where else would Chris Martin and Gwyneth Paltrow go when their sonMoses wanted a guitarfor his 16th birthday? The store – and with it Harris’s life and career – is now the subject of a documentary of the same name.Virtuoso blues guitarist Joe Bonamassa may be Harris’s most valuable customer. He has one of the world’s finest collections of Fender and Gibson guitars, many bought from the proprietor’s prized stash. He says Harris is every bit as much of a draw as the instruments he sells, like “an electromagnet” attracting people from all over the world, yet Harris doesn’t seem to realise he is the star of the show.It all began with a secondhand bass guitar. Fifty years ago, Harris was playing keyboards in a Miami band when his bandmates asked him to fill in on bass. He scoured the local paper for a used instrument and landed on an early Fender Jazz bass. “Everyone went gaga over that Fender Jazz,” he says. This included his friend Jaco Pastorius, considered by many to be the greatest bass player of all time. “I was offered more money for it than I paid for it, so I noticed that there was a market and thought maybe I could make a few dollars chasing down instruments like that and selling them on. And it just kind of rapidly built.”Things were also taking off with Harris’s band, Katmandu – Bobby Caldwell was the singer, Little Richard and his brother Peyton Penniman were their managers and they had supported the likes of Jimi Hendrix and Canned Heat – and were urged to relocate from Florida to California, so that’s what Harris and his wife, Marlene, did. The decision was made easier by the availability of instruments on the west coast, which inadvertently contributed to the end of Harris’s career as a pro musician – business grew so quickly that he had no time for much else.“It was kind of a smorgasbord in LA,” he says. “There was every instrument I had ever heard about but never actually seen, all right there.” Before long, there were 50 or 60 used guitars in the couple’s apartment, bought after scouring local newspapers and visiting pawn shops.“A lot of the music stores didn’t want to touch used instruments back then. And they would laugh at me and say things like: ‘You’re paying more for this old guitar than I am for this new guitar.’ I just used to think: ‘OK, keep laughing, and just keep selling them to me.’”Harris says he knew in his gut that American-made guitars from the mid-1950s to early 60s would one day be hugely desirable – “future antiques” he calls them – and he was right. While you couldn’t argue that he single-handedly created the vintage guitar market, he certainly shaped it, and there is no one else who was as ahead of the curve as Harris or as knowledgable about the intricacies and idiosyncrasies of each model. He also knew when to say no to a guitar and walk away.View image in fullscreen‘Future antiques’ … Harris in his store.Photograph: Jeremy Danger“I was never interested in just amassing guitars, or having multiples of the same guitar. I wanted guitars that were hardly played and all original – just prime examples, really.”The strategy paid off that day in 1973 when Harrison came calling. Harrison was seeking a replacement for Lucy, his one-of-a-kind Gibson Les Paul that had been stolen earlier in the year. It was a 1957 Goldtop refinished in red that had formerly been owned by John Sebastian of the Lovin’ Spoonful and Rick Derringer of the McCoys, before being bought by Eric Clapton and given to Harrison. Clapton used the instrument on the Beatles’ While My Guitar Gently Weeps.After the theft, Lucy was sold to a musician in LA. Once Harrison had tracked down the guitar, the guitar’s new owner argued that he had purchased Lucy in good faith but said he would return it to Harrison if he got him another 1950s Les Paul and a Fender Precision bass in exchange.This is when a mutual friend became involved, who knew that Harris had three 1950s Les Pauls at his apartment. When Harrison visited, he bought two 1958 Les Paul Standards – one for the trade, one for himself that he fell in love with. Today, each of those guitars, even without the Harrison connection, would sell for more than £250,000.“We actually spent the day together. I then went to this place he was renting in the Hollywood Hills. Ravi Shankar, the Indian sitarist, was there. To me, the Beatles were bigger than the pope or the president or whoever. I just kept looking at him – I couldn’t believe it was happening.”Harrison offered Harris his Gretsch Country Gentleman, used in his Beatles days, in part payment. But Harris passed – the biggest mistake he ever made, he says now. “I’m not a huge Gretsch fan, and more importantly, I didn’t think anybody would ever believe that I’d spent the day with George and bought his Beatles guitar.”He might not have made that deal, but they did smoke a lot of hash together that day. “It was like having a glass of wine with someone in those days and in those circles,” he says. “I did a lot to destroy a number of brain cells in the 60s and 70s. But I’m still mostly functioning, and I definitely still remember that day.”Robbie Robertson – lead guitarist with the Band, who backed Bob Dylan – was a regular customer, having replied to an ad Harris placed in the LA Times looking for guitars and being drawn in by Harris’s warmth and unbeatable stock. Not that Harris recognised him when he saw him, having never seen the Band perform live, despite being a fan. “He was really impressed that I had a lot of the stuff he was looking for, so I told him to bring some friends. Not long after, he came back with Bob Dylan andJoni Mitchell.”View image in fullscreenHarris on the roof of Norman’s Rare Guitars in Los Angeles.Photograph: Jeremy DangerHarris and Robertson’s friendship was cemented during the filming of The Last Waltz, the Band’s 1978 concert film, directed by Martin Scorsese: most of the instruments and amplifiers featured were loaned from Harris. Robertson had recently bought his 1954 Stratocaster from Harris, then dipped it in bronze. Robertson also makes an appearance in Norman’s Rare Guitars, in footage filmed just before his death in 2023. “He had cancer and didn’t have long left then,” says Harris. “But he said for me, he’d do it. He was such a great guy and a good friend.”The Last Waltz wasn’t Harris’s first involvement with the film industry. Hal Ashby knew exactly who to ask to supply instruments for his 1976 Woody Guthrie biopic Bound for Glory. Come 1984, there was only one person who could provide the required level of unicorn-like guitars to fill out Nigel Tufnel’s collection in This Is Spın̈al Tap.Most famously, Harris loaned the producers of Back to the Future the red Gibson played by Marty McFly at the Enchantment Under the Sea dance. As has been well documented, the guitar in question – a Gibson ES-345 – wasn’t released until 1958, three years after the film’s 1955 setting. Harris suggested a period-correct Fender Stratocaster or a Gibson ES-5 Switchmaster, but director Robert Zemeckis refused, insisting that a time traveller like McFly wouldn’t be constrained by such pettiness.After it was returned, Harris sold the guitar. Decades later, a woman walked into his shop offering to sell it back to him for $1m. After he stopped laughing, he said no, although his shop manager at the time, Mark Agnesi, tried to twist his arm, saying that if he had the money, he would buy it himself. Agnesi is now director of Gibson, and in a position to spend big on such a storied instrument on behalf of the company. Except no one knows where it is. Agnesi launchedLost to the Futureearlier this year, a global appeal for the guitar. The search goes on.Regular viewers of Norman’s Rare Guitars’ YouTube channel will be familiar with Harris’s warehouse, where he has squirrelled away hundreds of museum-grade instruments for a rainy day. Its location is known to only a handful of people.“There was this rumour for years about that stash,” says Bonamassa. “I’d known Norm for years – and spent plenty of money with him – before I was invited out there. It was like that scene at the end of Raiders of the Lost Ark – that long shot with all the crates. It was unbelievable.”View image in fullscreenJoe Bonamassa in the documentary film Norman’s Rare Guitars.Photograph: Devin J DilmoreBonamassa has been to the warehouse many times since, and says he always goes with a heavy heart, knowing that he’s going to see some “holy grail guitars” that will certainly leave a dent in his wallet. “If Norm stashed it away, it meant it was a cut above – the cleanest, the straightest, the most original. I went there last year and bought five guitars, among them the last of Norm’s blond dot-neck Gibson 335s and a Fender Broadcaster.” (Guitar enthusiasts will drool at the very mention.)A portion of the film is dedicated to Harris’s recent health scares. He had cancer, then had a heart attack while undergoing treatment. Mortality is clearly on his mind, not least what should happen to the business, and all those guitars, when he’s no longer around to shake the hand of the person buying them.“I had to get things in order.” he says. “Just in case. So I’m going to try to leave as little a mess as I can.”“He’s 75,” says Bonamassa. “For years, he’s been saying to me, ‘I want you to take over the store.’ But I have a job already. The problem is, if Norm’s not there to run it, then it’s just a namesake. It would just be a brand. When you take him away, you take away the heart and the soul. It wouldn’t be the same. There’s only one Norman Harris.”Norman’s Rare Guitars is available torent or buy here.Explore more on these topicsMusicDocumentary filmsThis Is Spinal TapGeorge HarrisonThe BandJoni MitchellBob DylanfeaturesShareReuse this content"

This is something that Stewart Lee jokes about during a brief and expertly executed standup set the following day, while characterising the audience, with affection, as a bunch of “sandal-wearing” indie-folkers. Sea Power put in a herculean effort to play their third gig of the weekend on Sunday, despite some members being up until eight o’clock that morning, resulting in a chill and woozy set that feels custom-built for fragile brains.‘The music industry is smoke and mirrors’: how DIY duo the Lovely Eggs are keeping the north weirdRead moreWhile Krankenhaus is endearingly back to basics, it’s also deceptively vast. Steam train trips and guided walks in sublime mountainous settings open up its cosiness into even more beautiful terrain.

Although it is unknown exactly how many people are staying home due to Ice’s aggressive arrests, immigration sweeps at restaurants, farms, Home Depots and even car washes have created a chilling effect on businesses that rely on immigrant labor. Restaurants such as Amiga Amore and other groups from the food and hospitality industry are stepping in to help people in their community who have nowhere to turn – even while their own businesses are sufferingeconomically.Immigrants make up a sizable share of the workforce in the restaurant industry. According to the Public Policy Institute of California, a non-profit, nonpartisan thinktank, restaurants in the golden state are staffed overwhelmingly by Latinos and immigrants –79% and 66%respectively. Nationwide, at least20%of restaurant workers are immigrants. “Latinos are not only the backbone to our industry, they are the industry,” said Duran Zecca. “Behind every chef are Latino line cooks ready to make magic happen. All they want to do is work, make a living and feed their families.”To make her deliveries twice every month, Duran Zecca receives logistical support from her good friend Damián Diaz, the co-founder ofNo Us Without You, an LA-based non-profit that provides food security for undocumented people, including back of the house staff from bars and restaurants.View image in fullscreenDanielle Duran Zecca began personally delivering meals to 25 to 30 people every other Sunday in Boyle Heights.Photograph: Courtesy of Danielle Duran Zecca / Amiga Amore“The administration has been doubling down on making it much more difficult for the families in the community and also small grassroots organizations like us to really be impactful,” said Diaz. In the past, No Us Without You had drive-through lines for food distribution, but stepped-up enforcement made that impossible, so they pivoted to working with a coalition of restaurants to serve up to 40 families every fortnight so they can shelter at home.“This environment of fear in light of increased enforcement, and really excessive enforcement, is causing folks to miss out on some very key necessities such as doctor’s appointments and going to the grocery store,” saidRita Fernándezdirector of immigration policy project at UnidosUS, a Latino non-profit advocacy organization. “It’s leading to a point where people are withdrawing from public life.”This summer, Congress allocated$170.7bnin additional funding for immigration and border enforcement through the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which was signed into law by Donald Trump. The shocking sum is fueling Ice’s operations and creating what somecriticscall a “deportation-industrial complex”.“What we are seeing already is going to be turbocharged,” said Fernández.That’s why many others in the restaurant and non-profit industry have also been mobilizing to bring groceries to immigrants who are inhiding. The Oaxacan-Mediterranean restaurant X’tiosu in Boyle Heights, one of the US’s most heavily Latino-populated neighborhoods, packed 150 bags of fresh produce, dried pasta and other goods that were delivered to people in need by local Oaxacan youth in June and they have continued to support undocumented families. The student-led group,Raíces Con Voz, coordinated food and care package deliveries to more than 200 families, andAquí Para La Comunidad, which operates throughout southern California, has a growing waitlist.Vanny Arias decided to host an impromptu food drive in front of theOffbeat Barin Highland Park, where she’s a bartender, after realizing people staying home were likely in need of groceries. “We had signs, we were on social media and we got so much food it was crazy – we filled up half the bar with food,” she said of the July event. Arias organized with other community activists and volunteers to start dispensing basics.Once she launched an Instagram account, she started hearing directly from desperate families. “People said: ‘My husband got arrested’ or ‘We’re afraid to leave the house and my kids haven’t eaten in days,’” said Arias. “When you’re on the ground you see the hurt and pain in their eyes and hear it in their voices.”Since July, Arias’sNela Food Distributionhas grown to deliver free groceries to 150 people in and around Highland Park with the help of community donations, two local food warehouses, a bakery and a team of volunteers. “We’re a bunch of people who love their community,” said Arias. “I don’t care what color you are, we’re freaking humans and I’m here for you. You’re not alone.”And it’s not just in and aroundLos Angeles. Efforts to help feed people staying home have stretched throughout the state.View image in fullscreenMohamed Saeed, owner of Dinuba Food Center.Photograph: Courtesy of Mohamaed SaeedWhen Mohamed Saeed, owner of Dinuba Food Center in the Central valley, saw that aggressive immigration enforcement was stoking fear in his community and keeping many of his regular customers away, he decided to launch a grocerydeliveryservice in June. “People are really scared; Dinuba is slow, there’s no traffic and people aren’t going outside like before,” he said of the city, which is primarilypopulatedby Latinos.Today, he makes up to 55 deliveries each day in and around Dinuba and tells his customers to only open the door once they see his logo on his truck. “I feel like if I make 40 deliveries in a day I help save 40 families who are staying home,” said Saeed, who immigrated to the US from Yemen at age 13. “My job is to serve the people living here and if I don’t do that then I don’t deserve this job.”UnidosUS’s Fernández said these grassroots efforts emphasize the resilience of the Latino community and broader community and that people coming together to help their neighbors offers hope and kindness at a critical time.“Myabuelitaand my mom taught me hospitality at home; it’s always about helping people,” said No Us Without You’s Diaz. “The past years have been relentless for so many families and communities. I really want to create an impact. It’s not about changing the world, it’s about changing your community and the folks who live in it.”Explore more on these topicsLos AngelesOur unequal earthCaliforniaUS immigrationWest CoastfeaturesShareReuse this content"

As the pianist plays a plucky staccato intro, it dawns on me that I am about to sing the West Side Story classic I Feel Pretty, with choreography, in front of a packed audience, alongside 200 gay men.This was my first time performing with theLondon Gay Men’s Chorus(LGMC) – Europe’s largest gay choir. I first saw them perform years earlier in Soho, where they sang Bridge Over Troubled Water at a vigil for thePulse nightclub shooting in Florida in 2016. After making it through the pandemic, the chorus’s years-long waiting list and months of rehearsals, I was under the bright stage lights, trying to remember the first line of the song and thinking: “what have I got myself into?”In some ways, the LGMC came into my life at the perfect time. I had recently gone freelance and I missed the upsides of having colleagues: gossip, after-work drinks and trivial office grudges. Looking back to my first rehearsal, when I had to wear a name tag to identify myself, I couldn’t have predicted how many friends I would make, often with people I wouldn’t have encountered in my social circle. One of my choir besties, Bradley, was raised as a Mormon in Utah. Our upbringings were different, but being two gay guys who love to sing the high notes transcends cultural barriers. On the gossip front, there were petty rivalries and microscandals worthy of aRyan MurphyTV drama – it’s a gay choir, after all.When I joined the choir, my biggest fear wasn’t the singing, but putting myself out there. After spending most of the pandemic staring at a screen, I had become jaded by the cynicism that underpins so many online interactions, where being seen to care about anything is “cringe”. But it turns out that once you have performed a fully choreographed version of Spice Up Your Life – assembled on the stage in a Geri Halliwell-inspired union jack formation – that fear rapidly disappears.View image in fullscreen‘Once I abandoned my cringe complex, it became fun to live out my Glee Club fantasy’ … Louis Staples.Photograph: Steve GregsonOnce I abandoned my cringe complex, it suddenly became much more fun to live out my Glee Club fantasy. Over the past four years, I’ve performed at venues including the Royal Albert Hall and Alexandra Palace. I marched in the 2022 parade marking 50 years of London Pride. I have travelled to Italy to sing in aPitch Perfect-style convention with hundreds of queer choirs from across the world. (Yes, this is areal thing.) I have been part of a 200-person rainbow Pride flag on the stage. These moments have not only helped me to feel less self-conscious, but they have also taught me that the things that bring us joy are never frivolous – even camp show tunes and sparkles.Last April, the LGMC gathered in Soho – just a few streets away from where I first heard them perform. We sang Erasure’s queer anthem A Little Respect, to mark the25th anniversary of the Admiral Duncan pub bombing. It was a testament to the power of being seen – andheard– for who you really are. As a small part of something much bigger, that is how joining a gay choir has made me feel. And I am reminded of that every time I step on to the stage, wearing a ridiculous glittery costume and once again thinking: “what have I got myself into?”Explore more on these topicsLife and styleThe one change that workedLGBTQ+ rightsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

One night, I started making a caesar salad, then wondered what would happen if I made a coriander-pesto mayonnaise and mugged off the anchovies in favour of chorizo. Then I thought about turning it into a full meal, at which point it stopped being anything like a caesar salad. If you’d prefer a vegetarian version, choose a vegetarian parmesan and omit the chorizo in favour of a heaped teaspoon of smoked paprika and a scant teaspoon of sea salt flakes.Crispy butter bean, chorizo and cos salad with corianderPrep15 minCook25 minServes250ml olive oil, plus 1 tbsp for roasting100g chorizo, cut into 1cm chunks400g tin butter beans, drained and rinsed well150g Tenderstem broccoli, cut into 1cm pieces50g fresh coriander, leaves and stems20g parmesan, or vegetarian parmesan25g pumpkin seeds1 egg yolkJuice of ½ lemon1tsp salt2little gem lettuce, roughly shreddedHeat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6. Put a tablespoon of olive oil, the chorizo and drained butter beans in a shallow baking tray and mix well. Roast for 20-25 minutes, until the beans start to crisp up nicely.Meanwhile, blanch the Tenderstem in a bowl of just-boiled water for two minutes, then drain well.For the dressing, put the coriander, parmesan, pumpkin seeds, 50ml olive oil, egg yolk, lemon juice and salt in a high-speed blender and blitz to a smoothish, pale green sauce: it should be almost as thick as mayonnaise, but with a little more texture. Taste and adjust the salt and lemon as needed.Just before you want to eat, tip the shredded lettuce into a large bowl and add the broccoli. Dress with a third of the dressing, then divide between two plates. Dot over the remaining dressing, scatter the butter bean and chorizo mix on top, and serve immediately.Explore more on these topicsSaladQuick and easyBeans, pulses and legumesFoodMain courseSpanish food and drinkVegetablesSausagesrecipesShareReuse this content"

It follows Nik Naks, a snack staple for many 90s children, which recently added Tangy ’N’ Cheesy to its lineup, its first new flavour in 40 years. Cadbury is also refreshing its Bournville range with a salted caramel twist, while Bacardi Breezer, once synonymous with the alcopop era, has undergone a rebranding and will relaunch this summer.Analysts say such moves reflect the pressure to stay relevant to younger consumers while also appealing to millennials, who grew up with these products.View image in fullscreenTangy ’N’ Cheesy Nik Naks.Photograph: KP SnacksThe PR and branding expert Lucy Sambrock said: “Millennials are the real target [audience] here. As 90s kids we’ve now got disposable income and young families of our own, so the emotional pull of nostalgic brands is powerful. Gen Z are a secondary audience: even if they didn’t live through the originals, they’re drawn to retro branding, playful limited editions and those Instagrammable moments.”Seyi Oduwole, lead food and drink analyst at the Future Laboratory, said: “Legacy products are being remixed for a generation that craves novelty and shareability.” She added: “We’re seeing a rise in ‘swicy’ (sweet and spicy) flavours and globally inspired twists. Reinvention is the secret ingredient to keeping classics relevant.”The trend reflects what the Future Laboratory calls a “flavour frenzy”, with food companies mixing the familiar with the unexpected. Rather than abandoning core products, they say, companies are increasingly positioning twists on existing formats as premium “little treats”, offering consumers something playful and escapist.For gen Z, experimentation is part of the appeal. TikTok trends featuring unusual food mashups, from pickle-tasting challenges to over-the-top martinis, have created an appetite for bold, unconventional combinations. “Younger consumers are far more open to experimental flavours,” said Ella Palmer, culture and insights manager at the branding agency Love. “But it’s not just about taste. Gen Z want to buy into a brand’s whole world: its story, its values, its community … gen Z want authenticity.”Reinvention carries risks. Sambrock said that when Heinz attempted to rename Salad Cream as “Sandwich Cream” in 2018, the backlash was swift, and the brand quickly reverted. Coca-Cola’s 1980s reformulation was pulled within three months. Marmite’s chocolate – launched in 2012, with notes of Marmite, onion and garlic flavours – also proved divisive, she added.Oduwole says: “Overly strange or disconnected flavour experiments will not perform if they don’t have context or emotional resonance. Consumers want a story, familiarity, comedy or sensory payoff; random weirdness for its own sake rarely sticks.”View image in fullscreenThe new design Bacardi Breezer 2025Photograph: BacardiSambrock said: “Consumers are protective of heritage brands … Reinvention works when it taps into genuine memories and gives people a reason to try again. It fails when the core product is changed or feels gimmicky.”Ross McPhie, senior lecturer in digital innovation at Teesside University, said that brand reinvention tends to “run in 20-year cycles. The 90s and 2000s are currently seeing a revival, in the 90s it was the 70s, in the 2000s it was the 80s.”He said: “Music and fashion, in particular, see these times as rich for inspiration. Arguably, the biggest reinvention has come in the form of Oasis reuniting to tour this summer. People were willing to pay exorbitant amounts of money to see them live thanks to this nostalgia.”The current revival of 1990s culture, seen in fashion, music and social media aesthetics, is helping create fertile ground for these revivals. But experts stress that nostalgia alone is not enough. “Millennials have a strong emotional pull to the brands they grew up with, while gen Z are discovering them through retro appeal,” said Oduwole. “But what keeps people coming back is the sense that these products are still fresh, playful and relevant.”Explore more on these topicsFood & drink industryFoodMarketing & PRnewsShareReuse this content"

That was the start of an elaborate scam that nearly cost him his savings.The day after the call, Stanwyck received a message from O2 confirming dispatch of a £1,000 iPhone 16 Pro Max handset. Perplexed, he called O2 to remonstrate. He told the company that a new handset had not been mentioned as part of the deal, and he didn’t want it. Nonetheless, the phone was delivered two days later. Stanwyck called O2 to reject it and was told he would be sent a prepaid bag to return it in.The next morning there was a knock on the door, and Stanwyck handed over the unopened box to the caller, who said he was a courier sent by O2.“I didn’t think about the fact that I had not been given a receipt until later, and that did worry me,” he says. Three days later, the promised returns bag arrived from O2. Alarmed, Stanwyck called customer services and says he was assured the handset had been received.What happened next threatened his good name and his savings. A letter from O2 informed him that it was terminating his contract and referring him to its fraud department. It told him to pay £1,072 within 14 days. It transpired the phone had vanished – the courier was nothing to do with O2.“Now I am classed as a thief and owe money I don’t have for a phone that I never wanted and have not got,” he says. “I can’t work out how this has happened or whether someone from O2 is in on it.”In fact, Stanwyck had fallen victim to a crime that began with a phishing call from a fraudster masquerading as an O2 sales agent.Criminal gangs call batches of phone numbers stolen from data hacks or bought on the dark web and offer tempting discounts on contracts or devices. They may not know who your mobile provider is – what they do know is that some of the people they call will be customers of the company they are posing as, and may be susceptible to the bogus deal.A clue to the scam was the quality of the line, which Stanwyck says was crackling, and the poor English of the caller, which he says he struggled to understand.During the call, the fraudster tricked Stanwyck into disclosing the “one-time authorisation code” (Otac) – also known as one-time password – with which O2 verifies identity when a customer logs in. That allowed the fraudster to order an iPhone on Stanwyck’s O2 account.The second part of the fraud was the fake courier who arrived to intercept the package before the genuine returns bag arrived. If Stanwyck had not already arranged to return the phone, the “courier” would have tried other means to dupe him into handing it over. Other victims have been told their parcel was sent in error.O2 confirmed Stanwyck had been a victim of fraud after Guardian Money intervened. It wiped the debt, cancelled the credit agreement the criminals had signed him up to and closed its fraud case.“We always aim to take swift action whenever fraud is reported to us, and we apologise that in this case it took longer than it should have done,” says a spokesperson. “We urge customers to be vigilant if they receive a call out of the blue from someone claiming to be from O2, and remember that if a deal sounds too good to be true, it probably is.”On its website, O2 has publisheda detailed warningto customers about these scams.Marina Gibbs, the policy director for networks and communications at the telecoms regulator Ofcom, says:“Customers endure a barrage of scam calls, and when people get caught out, the consequences can be devastating. The work we’ve collectively already done has led to 1m calls a day being blocked, but we’re always looking for new ways to shore up our defences in the fight against fraud.”* Name has been changedHow to avoid being scammedAlways beware cold calls offering eye-catching deals, especially if you are being pressed into signing up immediately.Companies will never under any circumstances ask for an Otac. If you are asked for one, hang up.Companies will never ask you to disregard security warnings from your bank or any other service provider.Beware calls and texts that begin with an impersonal greeting, ask for your bank details or passwords, prompt you to click a link or demand immediate payment.Mobile phone providers will always provide a prepaid envelope for device returns, and it will always be to the address of their returns centres.If you are suspicious of a caller, end the call and ring your phone company. Wait a few minutes so that the line to the scammer is not still open when you dial.Report a suspicious call or message that purports to be from your phone company to your service provider.Explore more on these topicsScamsMobile phonesConsumer affairsO2featuresShareReuse this content"

We asked experts how to approach it betterThere’s no need to avoid it – conflict can be essential to deepening intimacy, understanding and connection with family, romantic partners and co-workersMadeleine AggelerMon 25 Aug 2025 12.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 25 Aug 2025 17.53 EDTShareReality TV is generally not the first place one should turn to find models of effective communication. That’s why it was shocking to watch ascenein the latest season of Love Island US, in which Chris, a basketball player, asks the woman he’s seeing – Huda, a fitness influencer – if there’s anything he does that bothers her.It affects his mood “when something goes wrong, but I’m confused about what happened”, he says.What happened was that Chris taught a yoga class to the islanders (as Love Island contestants are called) and had asked everyone except Huda if they had anything to share.Huda, sounding sad, says he had skipped over her.“I did forget you, you’re right,” Chris says.It was a surprisingly mature conversation for Love Island, a show where attractive singles in skimpy swimsuits get locked in a villa for several weeks and try to find love. It can be difficult to approach conflict in a healthy way in such a high-pressure environment: on-air conflict tends to involve contestants shouting over each other andhurling insults.So what doeshealthy conflictactually look like, and how do you practice it? We asked experts about how to approach conflict with romantic partners, family members and co-workers. Spoiler: the advice applies in basically any situation. It might even work on Love Island.Is conflict actually good for us?The first thing to know about conflict is that it should not be avoided.“Conflict is normal and healthy,” saysRachel Moheban Wachtel, a licensed clinical social worker in New York who has worked extensively with couples. Conflict can be essential to deepening intimacy, understanding and connection, she says.If she gets mad at her husband, and he notices her reaction is disproportionate to the situation – which happens all the time with couples – “it’s an opportunity for him to learn what’s going on with me”, she explains. “It’s learning what each other’s triggers are.”Perhaps counterintuitively, if you don’t have any conflicts in yourrelationship, “then you have to worry”, she says.Disagreements can also teach us about ourselves, says Dr Sara Corse, chief clinical officer at the Council forRelationshipsin Philadelphia.“We think we know what we think and feel, and we think we know what other people think and feel, but we’re often wrong,” she says. Having adifficult conversationcan help us clarify or evolve our own views on a topic. (In my own relationship, for example, conflict has taught me a great deal about how to properly load a dishwasher. Apparently you don’t just toss in dishes at random and hope for the best.)Dr Amy Gallo, the author ofGetting Along: How to Work With Anyone (Even Difficult People)and contributing editor to the Harvard Business Review, says conflict is her “favorite topic”.“People assume that, as a conflict expert, I get brought into organizations to help them deal with too much conflict. It’s the exact opposite,” she says. “Ninety-nine per cent of the time, what I’m helping leaders and organizations do is have more conflict.”Conflict leads to better work outcomes and stronger relationships within an organization, Gallo says, because it leads to “a more inclusive environment where people feel like there’s psychological safety. They can say what’s on their minds and disagree with the people around them because that’s a normal thing.”Why do we find conflict so challenging?If conflict is so great, why are so many people uncomfortable with it?Many of us are socialized to avoid conflict, Gallo says. As a result, people can fear that disagreement is a sign that something has gone wrong, or that it signals to others that they are a difficult person.“We are taught over and over again that conflict is incredibly difficult, negative and destructive,” Gallo says. “Very rarely are we given the message that it’s normal to disagree, and differences of opinion make a team stronger.”Still, it’s important to not go overboard in our confrontations.“There are dysfunctional patterns in some families where they do most of life in a conflictual way,” says Corse. Conflict can strengthen intimacy, but it should not be the primary tool for building closeness, she argues. Sometimes, it’s best to just let things go.“It’s an internal balance of: I don’t need to pick every fight, I don’t need to always be right,” Corse says.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWell ActuallyFree weekly newsletterPractical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good lifeEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Here are some techniques experts use.Listen:“One of the tools I use intherapya lot is empathic reflecting,” says Corse. This involves actively listening to someone and then repeating back in your own words what you heard them say.Often, people get empathic reflecting wrong, Corse says. “Someone tells us something, and in order to be empathic, we start telling our story, and we miss acknowledging and validating what the other person said,” she explains. In conflict, this can devolve into a verbal tennis match with each side volleying grievances at the other without truly hearing what the other person has to say.Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’When both parties feel heard, healing can happen without each side needing to agree with the other. “Processing helps you resolve it,” says Moheban Wachtel. “As long as each person has expressed their position and feels heard, they can move on.”Balance the positive and the negative:When you have an issue with someone, “you don’t only want to talk about the negative”, says Moheban Wachtel. Ideally, one offers four positives for every negative.“It’s saying: ‘I love this, this, this and this about you, but when you do this, it really hurts me,’” she explains.Doing this not only makes it easier for the listener to take criticism, it also forces the speaker to communicate their position in a healthy, loving way, Moheban Wachtel says.Pause if things get too heated:Even when everyone involved has an open mind and the best intentions, conflict is challenging, and it’s easy to get overwhelmed. If this happens to one or both parties, it’s a good idea to take a break.“When I think about what is healthy conflict resolution, it starts with being able to calm yourself emotionally,” Corse says.Is my friend mad at me or am I just insecure?Read moreIf you start to feel yourself getting overwhelmed – maybe your heart’s racing, or your breath is shallow – ask for a timeout. And when you do, make sure to signal to the other person that you’re still invested in the conversation. Corse suggests saying something like: “Can we take a break to calm ourselves down? I want to be able to hear what you’re thinking, and I want to be able to share what I’m thinking, but right now we’re too emotional to have a productive conversation.”You don’t have to be perfect:“The challenge with healthy conflict is that it often veers between healthy and unhealthy the entire time,” says Gallo. Someone may slip in a snide comment or raise their voice. “We’re humans, we’re messy,” she says.Gallo says that when she evaluates whether a conflict is healthy or not, she evaluates whether it helped the team reach its goals in some way. Did your disagreement bring you closer to your partner? Did it help your team at work make a decision about a project? That is more important than whether both parties remained even-keeled during the whole discussion.Repair, repair, repair:For Moheban Wachtel, the benefits of conflict come from how you repair after it happens.“It’s processing the conflict, and understanding why it happened, and what’s going on in each person’s subjective reality,” she says. “That processing helps you resolve it.”Explore more on these topicsWell actuallyRelationshipsWork & careersfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The oil on your skin – sebum from pores – is mostly influenced by hormones and genetics.”The primary cause of acne is an increase in androgens, or male sex hormones, which happens in men and women at puberty. This triggers an increase in production of sebum, and mixed with dead skin cells, this can block the pores. The oily environment allows bacteria (Propionibacterium acnes), which are naturally present on the skin, to thrive, leading to inflammation. Other hormone shifts, such as those caused by polycystic ovary syndrome or progesterone-only contraception, can also be to blame.People try to change their diet to treat acne, but restrictive diets can be harmful, especially for teensIs it true that … you need to lift heavy weights to build muscle mass?Read moreEnvironmental factors do play a role, says Simpson. And though this doesn’t include greasy food consumption, it could include our stress levels and our diet in a wider sense.Acne has become more widespread over the past century. Some believe the rise could be linked to an increase in high glycaemic index foods, such as simple carbohydrates and sugary treats, though Simpson stresses that nothing is certain. “There’s emerging evidence that refined sugars may contribute,” she says, explaining that researchers are exploring how gut health is linked to skin health.If you’re dealing with acne, and self‑management with gentle, soap-free cleansers and moisturisers hasn’t helped, it’s best to consult a doctor early. “People try to change their diet to treat acne, but restrictive diets can be harmful, especially for teens, unless done under medical supervision,” says Simpson.Explore more on these topicsHealth & wellbeingIs it true that …FoodSkincareBeautyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It felt as though the spirit of Agatha Christie’s most famous character – best known for solving the Murder on the Orient Express – was lingering in the breeze at Palermo’ssublime botanical garden, which had been transformed into a makeshift waiting room for the 40 or so travellers about to board an Italian replica of the fabled train.Sipping espresso and samplingcannoli,the classic Sicilian pastry, the curiosity and suspicion for which Poirot is famous was palpable as the passengers subtly sized each other up. But the only mystery waiting to be unravelled over the next couple of days was whether their Rome-bound journey on La Dolce Vita Orient Express would live up to their dreamy expectations.View image in fullscreenThe sleeperrolled into service in Aprilwith the aim of reviving the glamour of the original train, as well as the romanticised notion of Italy’sdolce vita, or “sweet life”, not to mention tapping into the resurgence in demand for slow luxury travel.Comprising refurbished carriages formerly in service on Italy’s railway in the 1960s, the train has spent the last few months taking passengers on various journeys: through Tuscany’s wine region, to Venice and along the Ligurian coast – all of them sold out.Now the Dolce Vita has ventured south, and the Guardian was invited to experience its debut voyage from Palermo, Sicily, to the Italian capital.View image in fullscreenChrist the Redeemer statue in the town of Maratea on the Tyrrhenian coast.Photograph: NurPhoto/Getty ImagesThe original Orient Express made its initial journey in 1883, and crossed much of Europe on long-distance itineraries stretching from Paris to Istanbul, before reaching the end of the line in 2009, the victim of both high-speed rail and low-cost flights.But various offspring kept its legacy alive, with passengers still hungry for high-end nostalgic escapades far from the chaos of airports and overcrowded tourist hotspots.“The ultra-high-end market is constantly growing and demand for rail experiences is developing in a significant way,” said Dario Minutella, a luxury and fashion sector analyst at the management consultancy firm Kearney. “But it’s not just the preserve of millionaires or billionaires. There are many people with the time and resources seeking an experience, and Italy, with its long coastline and beautiful landscapes beyond the big cities, provides the perfect package.”After lunch on board curated by a three-star Michelin chef, we stop at Taormina to explore its ancient Greek theatreAt Palermo station, we were greeted by Stefano Sgambellone, the Dolce Vita’s train manager, and his team of impeccably dressed staff.“In 1883, the Orient Express became the first way to travel slowly, in luxury,” said Sgambellone, who for years worked for Venice Simplon-Orient-Express (VSOE), a luxury rail service with a range of European routes. “Today, slow travel is even more popular than it was then.”While the focus of VSOE is primarily the onboard experience, the Dolce Vita itinerary also includes off-board jaunts and experiences across its 10 Italy-only itineraries, such as learning to cook a local dish, exploring off-the-beaten-track medieval towns and dining in a private Venetian home.“People are choosing the Dolce Vita not only for the train itself, which is beautiful, but because it’s the best way to discover Italy,” said Sgambellone.View image in fullscreenA deluxe train cabin designed by Milan-based DimorestudioThe train’s whistle blew at 10.30am, and we departed Palermo.

A network of historic routes has opened up under itsTimeless Tracksinitiative, offering a cheap way to explore Italy’s less visited areas, such as the highlands and hidden hamlets of Abruzzo or the mountains of Friuli-Venezia Giulia, while promoting sustainable tourism. Tickets for these shorter trips start at just €5. There has also been a renewed focus on sleeper train services.The passengers on this trip had come from all over the world.

As a community leader in Santa Úrsula Coapa, a district in southernMexicoCity, he’s become adept at taking on developers and bureaucrats to protect his neighbourhood over the past decade.His latest fight may be his most ambitious yet: challenging the expansion of Mexico City’s national stadium ahead of the 2026 footballWorld Cup, which he claims neglects the community’s ancient rights.“The stadium is part of the community’s territory,” says Ramírez, sporting a wide-set sombrero. “It’s the owners, the businesspeople who are going to benefit from the World Cup. What are the community going to see? Nothing.”Mexico’s national Azteca Stadium – the largest in Latin America – is a sprawling complex. In June next year, it will host the opening match of the2026 World Cup, a tournament split between Mexico, Canada and the US. The stadium’s perimeter will be expanded to include new shopping and leisure centres, and there will be renovation of the Azteca itself.View image in fullscreenRenovation of the Azteca stadium, expected to be finished in March next year, includes a hybrid field, new changing rooms, hospitality zones and new seats.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesBut about 200,000 people live in the stadium’s shadows. They include Indigenous and native people, as well as the Santa Úrsula Coapa community, located just a stone’s throw from the main entrance. These individuals, many living in poverty, are quietly being affected by the World Cup plans, according to Ramírez.Chief among grievances is water – or the lack of it. The community’s water supply already experiences regular outages, and residents say it will be further threatened by stadium expansion due to increased demand.“We think the World Cup is going to magnify the problems, including the water shortage,” says Natalia Lara, an environmentalist and teacher.Water shortages are common across Mexico City, where ageing infrastructure losesan estimated 30-40% of supplyand rapid population growth has caused demand to outstrip the locallyavailable renewable freshwater resources. Many neighbourhoods routinely face rationing or water truck deliveries, especially in poorer areas.View image in fullscreenSlogans against the dispossession of land and water line walls outside the Azteca stadium.Photograph: NurPhoto/Getty ImagesIn the Azteca district, residents say the plight worsened in 2018 when a neighbouring well was privatised by Televisa – a Mexican telecoms company, which also partly owns the Azteca stadium. The Santa Úrsula community says this contract was illegal and has contributed to over-exploitation, with extraction now required at a depth of 400 metres against the original 80 metres.On 1 May, Lara was arrested alongside a colleague while protesting against the World Cup stadium expansion. The arrest was captured ina videowidely shared on social media. The charges were quickly dropped, but she says her arrest was part of a wider trend to silence protesters. Lara says: “It was a political abuse. It was totally arbitrary.”The office of Mexico City’s mayor, Clara Brugada, did not reply to a request for comment. However, during a community visit in May after protests, Brugada seemed to acknowledge the problem.Quoted by local media, she said Mexico could not be “hosting a World Cup if next to the great Azteca stadium we have a lack of water, flooding or other kinds of problems”.View image in fullscreenMexico City’s secretary of integrated water management, José Mario Esparza, speaks during a citizens’ assembly in the Santa Úrsula Coapa neighbourhood. But residents have complained about the lack of consultation.Photograph: NurPhoto/Getty ImagesActivists say no action has been taken since the meetings. They continue to send letters to government officials, accusing them of being in Fifa’s pockets. Their central plea is for the private concession, which extracts 450m litres of water annually, to be withdrawn. A spokesperson for the Televisa spinoff, Grupo Ollamani, said they “work very closely with the surrounding communities” and work with “the local government in order to alleviate their needs.”However, even activists like Lara want to celebrate the World Cup – as long as officials put people first. There is palpable excitement in this nation of football fanatics that Mexico will host the international tournament for the third time.“We’re not against the World Cup,” says Lara. “What we’re asking for is management of public spaces that’s not just for generating profits for private companies.”She says the problem is “how the environmental and social impact of these events” is handled.John Horne, a retired British professor of sport and sociology, has studied mega-events like the World Cup. His research found that these spectacles ofteninvolve the “routinisation of harm to local populations”, with the diversion of critical urban resources a key factor.His study also showed that the much-cited benefits of mega-events are often spread highly unevenly and the occasions frequently fail to deliver promised legacies,with notorious examplesincluding South Africa’s staging of the 2010 Fifa World Cup.View image in fullscreenA vendor sells flags of various Mexican teams outside the Azteca stadium less than a year before the start of the 2026 World Cup,Photograph: NurPhoto/Getty ImagesThe Mexican government estimates the World Cup will see up to a$7bn (£5.2bn) injection into the country. The capital aloneexpects to invest $250m(£190m) in infrastructure, along with promising jobs and improved services.Economic advancement would be welcome for communities surrounding the stadium, which are generally not well off.

Why do they have to build it here? Take it somewhere elseRubén RamírezIt may be a good sign that house prices in the area have risen above average, in anticipation of the games. Yet Lara suspects residents will see little economic benefit from the World Cup – at best, small earnings from charging for parking or selling drinks. Worse, rental prices are likely to rise. She says: “We’re going to get a tiny slice.”Ramírez has seen this before – stretching back to when the Azteca was constructed in the 1960s. Since then, life for the community has become nearly unbearable on match days, with extreme traffic congestion, resource depletion and noise pollution.He’s already lived through previous World Cups. Though smaller in scale, he says they brought little positive change and worries that promises of infrastructure improvement to the immediate area is a distraction from the underlying issues.For the Santa Úrsula community, the fight to be heard is deeply rooted in history. The constitution stipulates that authorities must legally consult local communities and leaders such as Ramírez when constructing on Indigenous land. They have failed to do so adequately, he argues.“We have a right to consultation,” he says. “They’re ignoring us completely. We don’t know anything.”The plans, he says, were publicly announced without prior consultation. Worse, other projects are being touted to take advantage of the World Cup buzz – including a dinosaur theme park. One proposed site is a 5,000 sq metre (55,000 sq ft) forest area inside Santa Úrsula that residents have protected for decades.View image in fullscreenRubén Ramírez says development plans threaten water sources and valued green spaces.Photograph: Isabel Woodford“They can’t take it, this is the lungs of the community,” says Ramírez. “Why do they have to build it here? Take it somewhere else.”If redevelopment occurs, families will lose homes to make way for lorries. The community will lose its main green space. Lara adds that the World Cup is being used to justify wider urbanisation plans and “gentrification” without regard for environmental and social challenges.Legal protections technically exist to prevent the urban forest’s destruction, but the government has failed to give solid assurances that communities will be spared construction. Developers continue to visit the site, and Televisa’s longstanding plans for a large luxury residential project nearby remain under discussion.View image in fullscreenSlogans protest at the dispossession of land and water outside the Azteca stadium.Photograph: NurPhoto/Getty ImagesFor Ramírez, it’s a reminder of inherent tensions with development and how Indigenous rights remain sidelined.“I’m not against development,” he says. “I’m just advocating that things get done the right way, and as the law dictates.“How is it possible that they have a first-class stadium, and next to it, a town that’s dead?”Explore more on these topicsWorld Cup 2026Southern frontlines: Latin America and the CaribbeanWorld CupMexicoAmericasIndigenous peoplesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

He started his career as a farmer, freelancer and small-time drug trafficker, moving small quantities of marijuana and heroin. As a logistics expert, he helped expand the Sinaloa cartel’s operations.As with Guzman, the drug trade became a family business: Zambada’s wife, four sons and four daughters were at one time all involved in drug-trafficking logistics. In 2019, a son, Vicente Zambada Niebla, testified “that his father’s bribery budget was often as much as $1m per month, with bribes going to many high-level Mexican public officials”.Zambada’s plea deal comes two weeks after federal prosecutors in New York said they would not seek the death penalty. Zambada’s lawyer, Frank Perez, told NBC Newsthat the decision “marks an important step toward achieving a fair and just resolution”.After Zambada entered his plea, US attorney general Pam Bondi said: “This foreign terrorist committed horrific crimes against the American people – he will now pay for those crimes by spending the rest of his life behind bars in an American prison.”DEA administrator Terrance Cole said Zambada’s guilty plea “proves no cartel boss is beyond the reach of justice. By taking him down, we are protecting American families and cutting off a pipeline of poison. DEA and our partners will not stop until every cartel network is dismantled.”After Zambada was arrested,US officials claimedthat he had not willingly traveled to the US but had been tricked by Guzmán’s sons, who had also turned themselves over to American authorities, to procure more favorable treatment.View image in fullscreenDepartment of Homeland Security officers patrol outside a plea hearing for Ismael Zambada Garcia in Brooklyn on Monday.Photograph: Olga Fedorova/EPAZambada wrote soon after his arrest there were “many inaccurate reports” and wanted everyone to know from the outset he did not surrender to US authorities, have an agreement or come voluntarily.“To the contrary, I was kidnapped and brought to the US forcibly and against my will,” he wrote.Zambada petitioned the Mexican government to request extradition to the country. And Mexico said it was investigating anyone involved in handing over a Mexican citizen to foreign agents as a treasonable offense.The drug lord’s plea deal comes as Donald Trump’s administration is applying pressure on Mexico to crack down on the cartels and is reportedly planning to begin using military force against the organizations, including the Sinaloa organization, which the US government deems to be terrorist groups.Earlier in August , the New York Timesreportedthat Trump had issued a directive to the Pentagon to begin using military force to curb the flow of narcotics in the US, a task typically assigned to law enforcement agencies.Zambada’s plea deal comes as Guzmán, his former Sinaloa partner, recently filed a federal complaint alleging that he faces cruel and unusual conditions of confinement inside the SuperMax federal prison in Florence, Colorado, where he is being held.Human rights attorneys for Guzmán said their client suffered from “near-constant severe sinus, ear, nose, and throat pain for years without adequate medical care” and has experienced “severe sleep deprivation for years due to the conditions of confinement in his cell”.The filing claims Guzmán is kept in “all-encompassing isolation” that amounts to unconstitutional cruel and unusual punishment. And the filing maintains Guzmán will suffer “irreparable harm” as a result of the “unconstitutional isolation”.El Chapo’s attorney David Lanetold Denver 7that Guzmán was alleging “he is in complete and total isolation with virtually no human contact of any kind”.“He only speaks Spanish, and even the Spanish-speaking guards are instructed not to interact with him or talk with him,” Lane said. “So this is complete isolation from any human contact.“It’s government control … The most dangerous entity on Earth is a government that’s unchecked and can do whatever it wants. We are here to defend [Guzmán] against the government and protect all of our fundamental rights.”The Associated Press contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsUS crimeMexicoDrugs tradeAmericasJoaquín 'El Chapo' GuzmánnewsShareReuse this content"

They turned it back over to the state to confirm anything that had happened or what had been found in this traveler.“Another source said that state veterinarians had learned about a human case in Maryland during a call last week with the CDC. A Maryland state government official also confirmed a case.A spokesperson for the Maryland department of health did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Screwworms are parasitic flies whose females lay eggs in wounds on any warm-blooded animal. Once the eggs hatch, hundreds of screwworm larvae use their sharp mouths to burrow through living flesh, eventually killing their host if left untreated.The maggots’ feeding is similar to a screw being driven into wood, giving the pests their name. Screwworms can be devastating in cattle and wildlife, and rarely infest humans, though an infestation in either an animal or a person can be fatal.Treatment is onerous, and involves removing hundreds of larvae and thoroughly disinfecting wounds. But infestations are typically survivable if treated early enough.The emails from the Beef Alliance executive said that due to patient privacy laws, there were no other details available about the positive human case of screwworm. The person was treated and prevention measures were implemented in the state, the email said.A livestock economist at Texas A&M University was asked to prepare a report for Rollins on the impacts to industry of the border closure to Mexican cattle, according to the emails, a measure that has largely been in effect since November to prevent the arrival of screwworm to the United States.The CDC was required to report the positive New World screwworm case to both Maryland health officials and the Maryland state veterinarian, one of the emails said, adding that the CDC also notified other agriculture stakeholders.“We remain hopeful that, since awareness is currently limited to industry representatives and state veterinarians, the likelihood of a positive case being leaked is low, minimizing market impact,” the beef industry executive wrote.A representative for the Beef Alliance did not respond to requests for comment.Explore more on these topicsMarylandEl SalvadorGuatemalaAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

In the same period last year there were 21 incidents.The strait of Malacca, a narrow but key stretch of water located between Singapore, Malaysia, andIndonesia, is essential for global trade. It serves as a crucial maritime corridor between the Indian Ocean to the Pacific, via the South China Sea.Spanish tourists robbed by armed ‘river pirates’ in Peruvian AmazonRead moreA large portion of piracy and robbery incidents this year occurred in the Phillip Channel of the Singapore strait, where vessels are forced to slow down to navigate the narrow waterway, said Vijay Chafekar, ReCAAP ISC’s executive director.Most thefts were opportunistic and non-confrontational, with crew left unharmed, he said.According to the National Bureau of Asian Research, the strait is a regional “chokepoint” with an estimated 90,000 merchant vessels and 60% of global maritime trade passing through it annually.None of the 2025 incidents in the straits were classified as Category 1 – the most serious type involving firearms or hostage-taking – and 90% resulted in no injuries, according to ReCAAP data.Seven confrontations involved knives or replica weapons, and one crew member sustained a minor injury. Bulk carriers were the most frequently targeted ships (52%), followed by tankers (24%) and container vessels (11%).Analysts are divided on what is behind the spike, with some suggesting a link between increased maritime traffic caused by vessels seeking to divert from the Red Sea trade route, which has beenincreasingly disrupted by Yemen’s Houthi rebelsattacking commercial vessels.Perpetrators of the 2025 incidents were often part of low-level organised crime groups operating from remote Indonesian islands such as the Riau and Cula islands, said Daniel Ng, from the Asian Shipowners’ Association (ASA).“They operate in sampans [flat-bottomed wooden boats] to approach ships, often in the hours of darkness. They climb aboard using long poles with hooks and ropes.”Ng said the rise in cases could be linked to perpetrators becoming increasingly adept at finding “loopholes” to breach shipboard security, using Automatic Identification System (AIS) mobile data to their advantage.“They are often facing financial hardship due to factors like unemployment and poverty, they need to supplement income and appear to be becoming more skilled in breaching security measures.”A spokesperson for the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) said the surge in incidents was “concerning” and urged all ships to follow best management practices and promptly report incidents to the relevant authorities.Explore more on these topicsSingaporeIndonesiaPiracy at seaAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

The summoning of an ambassador is considered a formal and public notice of displeasure on the part of the host government.The French interior ministry said on Monday the number of antisemitic acts recorded in France in the first six months of 2025 had fallen by 27% compared with the same period last year, but remained significantly higher than in 2023.The ministry said police had registered 646 antisemitic acts from January to July, of which almost two-thirds targeted people, and the remainder buildings. France is home to western Europe’s largest Jewish population, at about half a million people.Among recent incidents, French prosecutors have placedthe manager of a leisure park who refused entry to a group of 150 young Israeli touristsunder investigation on suspicion of discrimination based on ethnic origin or nationality.Police are also investigating the felling of an olive tree earlier this month that was planted outside Paris in memory of a young Jewish man tortured to death in 2006. Macron has vowed that the perpetrators will be punished for antisemitic “hatred”.The US on Monday refused to back down on Kushner’s allegations. “We stand by his comments,” a state department spokesperson, Tommy Pigott, said. “Ambassador Kushner is our US government representative in France and is doing a great job.”France’s foreign ministry said Kushner’s comments were unacceptable and violated international law, which requires ambassadors not to interfere in the internal affairs of the countries they are posted to, as well as breaching “trust … between allies”.The ministry said in a statement that the rise in antisemitic acts in France since the Hamas attacks on Israel on 7 October 2023 was “a reality that we deplore” but that the French authorities were “responding with total commitment”.The French equality minister, Aurore Bergé, on Monday said antisemitic incidents throughout the west had reached “absolutely intolerable levels” but said the government’s fight against anti-Jewish hate crimes was “unambiguous”.She added that the issue was “too important to be used as a diplomatic bargaining chip”. The foreign trade minister, Laurent Saint-Martin, denounced what he called “erroneous and unacceptable” remarks by the US ambassador.France “need take no lessons whatsoever” from the US on antisemitism, Saint-Martin told the broadcaster TF1. France had “never stopped fighting” the rise of anti-Jewish acts, he said, adding that Kushner had “got the wrong target”.Patrick Klugman, a lawyer for several French victims of the 7 October attacks, said antisemitism in France had reached historic levels, but also defended the French government and said Washington was in no position to lecture Paris.“Over the past six years, no antisemitic murder has been committed in France, while sadly several have occurred in the US. The contrast is striking,” he posted on social media. “No country is in a position to lecture others; all must revise their approach.”Alain Jakubowicz, a lawyer and honorary president of League against Anti-racism andAntisemitism(Licra), also said France had no lessons to learn from the US on the subject, but added that antisemitism was “a real problem” in the country.“We have lived through an antisemitic summer, that’s clear,” he said. “A new incident every day. Attacks on buildings, people and symbols.”Explore more on these topicsFranceAntisemitismEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

It is a matter of the survival of our state, the image of our nation, and each and every family.”Bayrou said France was going through a “decisive moment”. If the government secured a majority in the confidence vote, it would be confirmed, he said, but “if it does not have a majority, the government will fall”.Early reactions suggested the centrist prime minister could well lose his gamble, toppling a government that was formed only last December after the premature collapse of his predecessor Michel Barnier’s even shorter-lived administration.The leader of the opposition party National Rally (RN), Jordan Bardella, said his far-right party would “never vote in favour of a government whose decisions are making the French suffer”. Bayrou had in effect announced “the end of his government”, he said.Manuel Bompard of the radical left Unbowed France (LFI) said: “The chips are down, and it is up to everyone to stake out their position clearly.” His party’s deputies “will vote on 8 September to bring down the government”, Bompard said.The Green party leader, Marine Tondelier, said on social media her parliamentary group would also vote against the government, as did the Communist party (PCF). Tondelier said Bayrou’s announcement amounted “de facto to a resignation”.Olivier Faure, the leader of the centre-left Socialist party (PS), also said it would vote against the government. Bayrou had “chosen to go”, Faure said, adding that it was “unimaginable” that PS or any other opposition party would vote for him.Bayrou acknowledged that the vote was a gamble. “Yes, it’s risky – but it’s even riskier not to do anything,” he told a press conference. France’s budget deficit hit 5.8% of GDP last year, nearly double the official EU limit of 3%.Opposition leaders said that if the government did fall, they would demand the dissolution of parliament and new elections. Bardella said: “Our fellow citizens are waiting for a change and a return to the ballot box: we are ready.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The war he has caused is appalling. But, whatever politicians have done, I don’t feel cutting off artistic conversations is ever a good way to help.”Allen had appeared on Sunday atMoscow international film week, via a remote link for a session hosted by film-maker Fyodor Bondarchuk, a long-term political ally of Putin and director of patriotic epics such as Stalingrad (2013) and the sci-fi filmAttraction.In a statement posted on social media, the ministry said: “Woody Allen’s participation in the Moscow international film week is a disgrace and an insult to the sacrifice of Ukrainian actors and film-makers who have been killed or injured by Russian war criminals in their ongoing war against Ukraine.”It added: “By taking part in a festival that brings together Putin’s supporters and voices, Allen chooses to turn a blind eye to the atrocitiesRussiacommits in Ukraine every single day for 11 years now.

We strongly condemn Woody Allen’s decision to bless Moscow’s bloody festival with his address.”According to reports inRussian media, Allen said that he had no plans to make a film in Russia but that he had “only good feelings for Moscow and St Petersburg”.Allen also reportedly said he admired Russian cinema, singling out the four-film literary adaptation War and Peace, directed by Bondarchuk’s father Sergei, which won the Oscar for best foreign language film in 1969.Allen’s last two films have been made with financial backing from European sources:Rifkin’s Festivalin Spain, released in 2020, andCoup de Chancein France, released in 2023. This followed the cancellation of hisproduction arrangement with Amazonin 2019; Allen sued Amazon and settled out of court. His legal dispute with Amazon followedan open letter published by Dylan Farrow in 2014renewing the allegations that Allen had sexually abused her when she was seven, which Allen denies and of which he has been cleared after two investigations.In 2024, Allensuggested he may retire,saying: “All the romance of film-making is gone.”Explore more on these topicsFilmWoody AllenRussiaUkraineEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

About 1 million refugees are believed to have settled in Poland since 2022, the majority of them women and children.The prime minister, Donald Tusk, criticised the veto, as did others in his government. “We cannot punish people for losing their job – particularly not innocent children. This is the ABC of human decency,” the labour minister, Agnieszka Dziemianowicz-Bąk, wrote on X. The child benefit payments are 800 złoty (£162) a month.“President Nawrocki does not agree to the privileged treatment of citizens of other countries,” said a statement released by his office. “That is why he has decided to veto the bill on assistance for Ukrainian citizens in its current form and will present his own legal proposals.”The government and president are stuck in a legislative deadlock. Tusk had hoped that his political ally Rafał Trzaskowski, the mayor of Warsaw, would win the presidential election, butthe rightwing Nawrocki wona tight contest, meaning he can veto government legislation. The government can also veto presidential proposals.The deputy prime minister and digital affairs minister, Krzysztof Gawkowski, claimed that by vetoing the legislation, Nawrocki also put at risk Poland’s continued funding of Starlink satellite internet forUkraine. “This is the end of Starlink internet, which Poland provides to Ukraine as it wages war,” he wrote on X. A spokesperson for Nawrocki told Reuters that Starlink payments could continue if parliament adopted a proposed presidential bill by the end of September.Poland wasone of the most welcoming countries in Europe to Ukrainiansin the aftermath of Russia’s full-scale invasion in February 2022, with millions of Poles volunteering to help at the border, donating to charitable causes or opening their homes to refugees.As time has gone on, anti-Ukrainian sentiment has been slowly increasing, despite studies showing that the influx of Ukrainians has benefited the Polish economy. A study by Poland’s National Development Bank this year found that Ukrainians had contributed more in taxes than they had received in benefits, and found that their labour was crucial for economic stability.The resentment has been fuelled by politicians looking to score points. Trzaskowski, the liberal presidential challenger, first called for tightening the rules for Ukrainians to access benefits during his failed election campaign. Back then, his proposed measures were supported by Tusk.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We are now in this other extreme. I believe at some point this will calm down and we will reach a balanced approach,” he said.Explore more on these topicsPolandUkraineEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

His legal team has argued that thecase should be thrown out,citing a technical error in how the charge was brought.Ó hAnnaidh was greeted byhundreds of supportersas he arrived at Westminster magistrates court for a hearing recently.When the charge was first announced earlier this year,Kneecapdescribed it as “political policing” and a “carnival of distraction” and vowed to “vehemently defend ourselves”.While their US tour dates have been cancelled, the band said on Monday that they had an upcoming surprise for US fans.“We will be sharing something very special for US fans next week so that we can still link with you all in October,” it reads. “It’s top secret for now, but all will be revealed next week.”The group confirmed that their planned Canadian shows in Vancouver and Toronto will still proceed as planned.The Belfast-based group – known for their political performances and outspoken support for Palestine – madeheadlinesin June during their Glastonbury set, where they led chants saying “fuck Keir Starmer,” referring to the UK prime minister.In April, the rap trio also made headlines fordisplaying statementsagainst Israel’s military campaign in Gaza at the Coachella festival.Explore more on these topicsKneecapEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Journalists and rescuers then rushed to the scene to help the wounded, when a second bomb struck the same spot, 15 minutes later.Israel’s attack on hospital in Gaza may constitute a war crime on many frontsRead moreA live video from AlGhad TV captured the moments of their killings, showing civil defence workers wearing bright orange vests and journalists raising their hands to shield themselves seconds before the second bomb kills them. A second video showed the aftermath of the bombings, with the bodies of the first responders and journalists lying on top of one another, bloody and covered in dust.The“double tap” strikeand killing of journalists prompted a wave of international condemnation, including from the UK foreign secretary, David Lammy. “Horrified by Israel’s attack on Nasser hospital. Civilians, healthcare workers and journalists must be protected. We need an immediate ceasefire,” Lammy wrote on X.The US president, Donald Trump, told reporters: “I’m not happy about it,” when asked about the attack, while the French president, Emmanuel Macron, described it as “intolerable”.mapMeanwhile, the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said Israel deeply regretted what he described as a “tragic mishap” at the Nasser hospital.Israel has regularly struck hospitals, claiming without evidence that Hamas uses them for military purposes. It also regularly kills journalists inGaza, on some occasions with the justification that the journalists were associated with Hamas – claims that journalistic bodies have described as baseless.The strikes on Monday killed the Reuters journalist Hussam al-Masri; Mariam Abu Dagga, who worked for the Associated Press; the Al Jazeera journalist Mohammed Salam; the photojournalist Moaz Abu Taha, and Ahmad Abu Aziz from Quds Feed. Another Reuters journalist, Hatem Khaled, was wounded in the attack.At least 193 Palestinian journalists have been killed since 7 October 2023, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), more than the number who died globally in the previous three years.View image in fullscreenMariam Abu Dagga pictured in Khan Younis in June.Photograph: Jehad Alshrafi/APThe CPJ condemned the Israeli strike and called for action from the international community. “Israel’s broadcasted killing of journalists in Gaza continues while the world watches and fails to act firmly on the most horrific attacks the press has faced in recent history,” said its regional director, Sara Qudah. “These unlawful killings must end now. The perpetrators must no longer be allowed to act with impunity.”The Associated Press said it was shocked and saddened to learn of Dagga’s death, as well as the deaths of the other journalists killed alongside her. “We are doing everything we can to keep our journalists in Gaza safe as they continue to provide crucial eyewitness reporting in difficult and dangerous conditions,” the agency said.Reuters said it was devastated at the news of the death of Masri and wounding of Khaled. “We are urgently seeking more information and have asked authorities in Gaza and Israel to help us get urgent medical assistance for Hatem,” a spokesperson said.View image in fullscreenThe damaged fourth floor of the Nasser hospital after the Israeli strike.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesA spokesperson for the Israeli military said the chief-of-staff had ordered a preliminary investigation into the strike and said Israel “expressed regret for injury to uninvolved personnel”. Israel “does not target journalists as such”, they said.Israeli inquiries into misconduct by its military rarely ensure accountability. Areportpublished this month showed that 88% of investigations into war crimes allegations in Gaza were shut down or left unresolved.

She reported on Nasser hospital doctors struggling to save children with no previous health issues who were wasting away from starvation.Independent Arabia said Dagga was the “example of dedication and professional commitment” and that she had carried “her camera into the heart of the field, conveying the suffering of civilians and the voices of victims with rare honesty and courage”.Dagga had forbidden crying at her funeral, a colleague and friend said.“Mariam had left us instructions not to cry for her when we bid her farewell. She wanted us to spend time with her body, speak to her and take our fill of her before she left,” said Samaheer Farhan, a 21-year-old freelance journalist and friend of Dagga.Dagga, like other journalists in Gaza, had written a will in case she was killed while reporting. She left behind a letter for her 13-year-old son, Ghaith, telling him: “Make me proud … become successful and excel.”Abu Aziz was based in the Nasser hospital, where he covered the impact of Israel’s attacks on people across Gaza. He had lost several colleagues during the war, as well as his own home, which was levelled in a strike. “It felt like I was all alone and the only one left on the ground as so many more of my colleagues were being killed,” Abu Aziz wrote in an article for Middle East Eye a year ago about his experience as a journalist in Gaza.Al Jazeera confirmed that Salam was among those killed in the Nasser hospital strike. Reuters reported that Masri, a contractor cameraman, was also killed. Khaled, a photographer who was also a Reuters contractor, was wounded, the news agency reported.Israel has prevented international media from covering the 22-month conflict, an unprecedented ban in the history of war reporting. Palestinian journalists in Gaza who work with international outlets carry out their duties while facing starvation and the risk of death.Q&AWhy is it so difficult to report on Gaza?ShowCoverage of the war in Gaza is constrained by Israeli attacks on Palestinian journalists and a bar on international reporters entering the Gaza Strip to report independently on the war.Israel has not allowed foreign reporters to enter Gaza since 7 October 2023, unless they are under Israeli military escort. Reporters who join these trips have no control over where they go, and otherrestrictionsinclude a bar on speaking to Palestinians in Gaza.Palestinian journalists and media workers inside Gaza have paid a heavy price for their work reporting on the war, with over180 killedsince the conflict began.The committee to protect journalists has determined that at least 19 of them “were directly targeted by Israeli forces in killings which CPJ classifies as murders”.Foreign reporters based in Israel filed alegal petitionseeking access to Gaza, but it was rejected by the supreme court on security grounds. Private lobbying by diplomats and public appeals byprominent journalistsandmedia outletshave been ignored by the Israeli government.To ensure accurate reporting from Gaza given these restrictions, the Guardian works with trusted journalists on the ground; our visual​​ teams verif​y photo and videos from third parties; and we use clearly sourced data from organisations that have a track record of providing accurate information in Gaza during past conflicts, or during other conflicts or humanitarian crises.Emma Graham-Harrison, chief Middle East correspondentWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.The Palestinian ministry of health said Monday’s strikes on the Nasser hospital had disrupted surgery in the operating theatre. It condemned the attack, which it said was part of a “systematic destruction of the health system”. The hospital is the only functioning public hospital left in southern Gaza.Health officials also reported gunfire that killed people seeking aid in central Gaza and airstrikes in Gaza City.View image in fullscreenPeople search for survivors after an Israeli airstrike on a residential building in Gaza City.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesAt least six people were killed and 15 wounded while trying to reach a food distribution site in central Gaza operated by the private US-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF). Shootings by Israeli soldiers near GHF sites are a near daily occurrence, though the Israeli military and GHF deny targeting people seeking food.A strike on a residential neighbourhood in Gaza City killed at least three people, including a child. Israel is preparing for an invasion of the city in the coming days, which it says it will occupy and take control of.Aid groups have said the operation would lead to displacement and a humanitarian disaster in Gaza, which is already in the throes of famine.At least 62,686 Palestinians have been killed since the beginning of the Gaza war 22 months ago. Israel launched its assault after the 7 October 2023 attack on Israel by Hamas-led militants in which about 1,200 people were killed and 250 taken hostage.Additional reporting by Michael SavageExplore more on these topicsGazaIsraelJournalist safetyIsrael-Gaza warMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinian territoriesReutersnewsShareReuse this content"

All categories that should be protected under international law.While the Israel Defense Forces, which have killed about 200 journalists alreadyin the Gaza war, immediately attempted to suggest the killing of civilians had been in error, the reality is that it appears to be policy and not a mistake.What is striking about this incident is that each individual element – the targeting of a working hospital,of journalistsand rescue workers, of civilian injured already under treatment – would be expected to draw accusations of a war crime in its own right.Taken together it points to something far darker, a “horrific” incident in the words of the British foreign secretary, David Lammy.As well as the 20 killed in the strikes, another 50 were injured according to the head of the World Health Organization, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, including patients who were already critically ill.“While people inGazaare being starved, their already limited access to health care is being further crippled by repeated attacks,” Ghebreyesus said on X.“We cannot say it loudly enough: STOP attacks on health care. Ceasefire now!”Explicitly linking the issues, the UN human rights office spokesperson, Ravina Shamdasani, said in a statement: “The killing of journalists in Gaza should shock the world – not into stunned silence but into action, demanding accountability and justice. Journalists are not a target. Hospitals are not a target.”It has been well documented how Israel has targeted hospitals and medical staff, who have been killed, wounded and abducted, on multiple occasions. But the reckless double-tap strike, where the IDF attacks a location for a second time as rescue workers and other civilians arrive, say critics, is an increasingly common tactic.A joint investigation in Julyby the Israeli +972 Magazine and Local Callreported that the IDF now routinely carried out additional attacks in the area of an initial bombing, sometimes intentionallykilling paramedicsand others involved in rescue efforts.“If there’s a strike on a senior commander, another one will be carried out afterward to ensure rescue efforts don’t take place,” said one of +972’s sources who it said was present in an Israeli attack planning cell. “First responders, rescue teams – they kill them. They strike again, on top of them.”While the IDF said it had launched an investigation into the attack, adding that its forces “in no way direct strikes at journalists”, Israeli officials’ own public remarks reveal that to be a lie. The claim is directly contradicted by Israel’s own statement after thekilling of Anas al-Sharif, a well-known Al Jazeera journalist, and four colleagues – again in the grounds of a hospital – earlier this month when it claimed without providing credible evidence that Sharif was targeted as a member of a Hamas cell.As the Committee to Protect Journalists said in a statement after Sharif’s killing by Israel: “The IDF have made unsubstantiated claims that many of the journalists they deliberately killed in Gaza were terrorists, including four Al Jazeera staff – Hamza al-Dahdouh, Ismail al-Ghoul, Rami al-Refee, and Hossam Shabat. CPJ classifies such cases as murder.”Indeed, before Sharif’s death, the CPJ publicly warned that his life was in danger after credible threats were made by a named Israeli military spokesperson. “We are deeply alarmed by the repeated threats made by Israeli army spokesperson Avichay Adraee against Al Jazeera’s Gaza correspondent Anas al-Sharif and call on the international community to protect him,” said the CPJ regional director Sara Qudah.“This is not the first time Sharif has been targeted by the Israeli military, but the danger to his life is now acute. Israel has killed at leastsix Al Jazeera journalistsin Gaza during this war. These latest unfounded accusations represent an effort to manufacture consent to kill Sharif.”And it is significant that Israel has killed journalists in the vicinity of hospitals. Since the beginning of the war, journalists have often stayed near hospitals in the hope they might provide a slight degree of protection, and because they often have at least some electricity where media can charge phones and equipment.For some senior UN figures, the only conclusion to be drawn from these attacks is that Israel is killing the world’s only available witnesses to the starvation it has visited on Gaza through its policies.Among them on Monday was the head of the UN’s agency for Palestinians, Philippe Lazzarini, as he condemned the “shocking” global inaction over Gaza, accusing Israel of “silencing the last remaining voices reporting about children dying silently amid famine”.That sentiment was echoed in the strongest terms by the emergency coordinator for Médecins Sans Frontières in Gaza, Jerome Grimaud, mourning the death of the journalist Mariam Dagga, who had worked with the humanitarian organisation.“For the past 22 months, we have watched as healthcare facilities have been levelled, journalists silenced, and healthcare workers buried beneath the rubble by the Israeli forces. As Israel continues to shun international law, the only witnesses of their genocidal campaign are deliberately being targeted. It must stop now.”Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warGazaPalestinian territoriesIsraelJournalist safetyMiddle East and north AfricaPress freedomanalysisShareReuse this content"

A separate statement by the junta said the bridge had been “exploded with mines”.MapA TNLA spokesperson rejected this and accused the junta of bombing the bridge. “[The] Myanmar army tried to bomb our bases ... this morning by using drones. They bombed our troops, but their bomb also hit Gokteik bridge,” TNLA spokesperson Lway Yay Oo said.In recent weeks, clashes have erupted between junta forces and TNLA fighters in the nearby towns of Nawnghkio and Kyaukme – though the junta claimed to have recaptured Nawnghkio in July.View image in fullscreenThe Gokteik viaduct, a 300-meter long bridge.

This was up from 4% in July and the highest reading since February 2024, according to its monthly shop price monitor.The BRC chief executive, Helen Dickinson, said the rapid rise added to the pressure on people already struggling with the cost of living.“Staples such as butter and eggs saw significant increases due to high demand, tightening supply, and increased labour costs,” she said.“Chocolate also got more expensive as global prices of cocoa remain high owing to poor harvests.”The BRC also said that its data showed that overall shop price inflation increased to 0.9% in August, even as non-food products fell by 0.8%.While shops were “doing everything they can to limit price rises for households”, Dickinson said, the industry faces£7bn in new costsafter last year’s autumn budget, when Rachel Reeves introduced changes to employer national insurance contributions and the minimum wage.Last week more than 60 retail bosses, including Tesco, Sainsbury’s and Boots, warned Reeves that increasing taxes further in the next autumn budget could contradict her plans to improve UK living standards.In a letter coordinated by the BRC, the bosses said they were expecting food inflation to hit 6% later this year.Mike Watkins, the head of retailer and business insight at NIQ, said that the uptick in prices also reflected other factors, including global supply costs, seasonal food inflation driven by the weather and the end of promotional deals linked to sporting events.“As shoppers return from their summer holidays, many may need to reassess household budgets in response to rising household bills,” Watkins added.Last week official figures showed that inflationrose again in July to a higher-than-expected 3.8%, partly driven by higher food prices and travel costs.The annual rate of inflation, as measured by the consumer prices index, climbed from 3.6% in June to sit above the Bank of England’s 2% target for the 10th consecutive month.Food and non-alcoholic beverages were up 4.9% year on year in July, the Office for National Statistics found, an increase from 4.5% in the 12 months to June. Beef, orange juice, coffee and chocolate were among the biggest risers.Droughts in Spain, Italy and Portugal, where the UK sources much of its fresh fruit and vegetables, have pushed up prices this summer, at a time when prices typically fall.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The rise would come into effect in October and remain in place until the end of the year.Charities have warned such a rise could mean millions of households will struggle to pay their energy bills.Simon Francis of the End Fuel Poverty Coalition said the average household was paying 67% more for their energy compared with the winter of 2020-21.The charity estimates that 12.1 million UK households are struggling with the cost of their energy bills and says they cannot shoulder any more price increases.“We are now approaching the fifth winter of the energy bills crisis and the time for tinkering with the price cap is over,” he said.Explore more on these topicsFood & drink industryRetail industryInflationUK cost of living crisisEconomicsEggsChocolatenewsShareReuse this content"

It then uses machine learning to recognise patterns that would be difficult for humans to detect.Currently, the disease is usually diagnosed using a mix of scans and biopsies, such as an ultrasound scan, a CT scan, a needle biopsy, a laparoscopy or surgery to remove tissue or possibly the ovaries.It is often detected late because symptoms such as bloating, feeling full quickly after eating or having to pee frequently are not always obvious potential signs of cancer.The blood test looks for what ovarian cancer sheds into the bloodstream, even in its early stages.Cancer cells release fragments into the blood that carry tiny, fat-like molecules known as lipids, along with certain proteins. This combination of lipids and proteins are like a biological fingerprint for ovarian cancer, according to AOA Dx, which developed the test.It also uses an algorithm that has been trained on thousands of patient samples to recognise subtle patterns across these lipids and proteins that signal ovarian cancer.The test can detect the disease “at early stages and with greater accuracy than current tools”, according to Alex Fisher, the chief operating officer and co-founder of AOA Dx.Dr Abigail McElhinny, the chief science officer at AOA Dx, added: “By using machine learning to combine multiple biomarker types, we’ve developed a diagnostic tool that detects ovarian cancer across the molecular complexity of the disease in sub-types and stages.“This platform offers a great opportunity to improve the early diagnosis of ovarian cancer, potentially resulting in better patient outcomes and lower costs to the healthcare system.”A study, led by the universities of Manchester and Colorado and published in the American Association of Cancer Research journal Cancer Research Communications, tested 832 samples using the AOA Dx platform.In samples from the University of Colorado, the test was able to accurately detect ovarian cancer across all stages of the disease 93% of the time, and 91% in the early stages.In samples from the University of Manchester, the test showed 92% accuracy at all stages and 88% accuracy in early stages.Emma Crosbie, a professor at the University of Manchester and an honorary consultant in gynaecological oncology at Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust, said: “AOA Dx’s platform has the potential to significantly improve patient care and outcomes for women diagnosed with ovarian cancer.“We are eager to continue advancing this important research through additional prospective trials to further validate and expand our understanding of how this could be integrated into existing healthcare systems.”Explore more on these topicsOvarian cancerCancer researchWomen's healthMedical researchnewsShareReuse this content"

There is no ‘honour’ in them. For too long, these offences have often been misunderstood by professionals, resulting in victims not getting the support they deserve.“Today we are announcing measures to put an end to this and shining a light on this debilitating abuse. This marks a crucial step in this government’s landmark mission to halve violence against women and girls within a decade.”As part of the changes, the national centre for violence against women and girls and public protection is working with the police to improve how officers assess the risks posed by “honour”-based abuse offenders. The Home Office will also pilot a study looking at how widespread this crime is.Emma James, the national policing lead for “honour”-based abuse, said it was a “complex crime” that often happened within community or family networks, making it difficult for victims to speak out for fear of further threats, violence and isolation.“That’s why it’s so important that policing works closely with other agencies to identify abuse and protect victims at the earliest opportunity,” she said.Recent statistics showed that 2,755 offences related to “honour”-based abuse were recorded by the police in England and Wales, including killings, female genital mutilation and forced marriage. Figurespublishedlast year found that the number of “honour”-based abuse offences recorded by English police forces had increased by more than 60% in two years, thought to be due to more victims coming forward, as well as political polarisation.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Natasha Rattu, the charity’s executive director, hailed the move as a “landmark moment” after years of campaigning for a statutory definition.“This step will mean victims are no longer overlooked but seen, heard and supported, while professionals are better equipped to act,” she said.Payzee Mahmod, a campaigner who is a survivor of child marriage and “honour”-based abuse, and whose sister, Banaz, died in an “honour”-based killing, added: “I know how vital it is that professionals from the police to social workers and teachers have the clarity and tools they need to recognise this abuse and act quickly to protect those at risk. This step represents meaningful progress towards better safeguarding and ensuring that survivors are properly seen, heard and supported,” she said.Yasmin Javed, whose daughterFawziyah Javed was pushed off Arthur’s Seatin Edinburgh, Scotland by her husband after learning she was pregnant and had planned to leave the marriage, said she was “pleased” the government had listened to calls from campaigners. “I hope that this will help many more people affected by HBA and ensure that the multiple perpetrators of this abuse are properly recognised and addressed,” she added.Explore more on these topicsDomestic violenceViolence against women and girlsLabournewsShareReuse this content"

Most of that clothing has been resold by charity partner Oxfam.As growth in donations has slowed, M&S is trying something new and will reward customers for Oxfam donations containing at least one M&S item with a £5 voucher when they spend £35 in its stores or online.To use the service customers must complete a short form on its website or scan a QR code in stores, then send their preloved items using a free local courier service to Reskinned, a repair and resale specialist.View image in fullscreeneBay x Marks & Spencer launch campaign.Photograph: Marks & Spencer/eBayThe best M&S items that can be worn again will be professionally cleaned, repaired by Reskinned then listed on the M&S eBay store. Items that cannot be resold will be responsibly repurposed or recycled.Oxfam will take a 15% share of M&S’s profits from the eBay sales and the rest will be split between the retailer, eBay and Reskinned. The charity will also continue to sell donated clothes, including non-M&S branded items that are not selected for the eBay store directly in its outlets.Katharine Beacham, the head of sustainability in fashion for M&S, said it had led the way with “shwopping”, which had “shifted the way people looked at clothes”. “We wanted to revamp shwopping to continue to improve how customers look at clothing and how they can give clothes another life.”The partnership with eBay gave M&S an opportunity to learn what customers were looking for from resale, she said. The company would consider how successful the eBay store was before potentially selling secondhand items via its own stores or website.The change in setup comes amid rapid growth in the sale of secondhand clothes online, with M&S one of the most searched for brands on eBay.Depop, the London-based secondhand clothing marketplace, is on track for $1bn (£740m) of annual sales for the first time, its owner, Etsy, said recently, after a 35% surge in sales to $250m in the three months to 30 June. The company said growth was driven by a 54% jump in sales in the US as it signed up a record number of new shoppers.Its rival Vinted reported a 41% rise in sales to almost €813m (£704m) for 2024 with profits almost tripling to €95.4m after the companystepped out of the red for the first timein 2023.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They are then stranded on a tropical island dressed only in their wedding outfit for a three-week honeymoon without phones, luxuries, family or friends.The idyllic looking island becomes a metaphor for marriage, as the reality of their situation – given basic rations and surrounded by insects – becomes apparent.While the show’s premise could be described as Love Island for older people crossed with First Dates crossed with Survivor, McCall says it is a “real” reality series that the producers “can’t steer” or predict.‘A sheer delight to watch’: the 20 most lovable people on British televisionRead moreShe said: “We’ll all learn something from it.

McCall said it was interesting to observe how her partner reacted.“It’s such a learning curve for everyone. Being out there, you are stripped of everything that makes you you and also makes you feel comfortable and safe or attractive. It’s a very, very difficult experience, especially when you’re with someone you don’t know at all.“These are big things that normally don’t happen for months. It’s the quickest induction into someone’s life and personality and who they are. If you can survive that, I feel like you can survive anything.”McCall said the Stranded participants “genuinely really want to meet someone – and it is difficult nowadays”. A point echoed by one contestant, Helen, who said she took part as she was tired of “the endless swiping” on dating apps.At a screening of Stranded in London, McCall said she agreed to front the series – which airs on BBC1 and iPlayer this autumn – after an operation toremove a benign brain tumourwhich, she confirmed, “is not coming back”.View image in fullscreen‘I love love’: Davina McCall said the participants on the show ‘genuinely really want to meet someone’.Photograph: Ian West/PAHowever, she said: ”It’s changed me, in a way … it’s made me want to absolutely live life to the max and grow old disgracefully and do everything I wanted to do. Because I do understand that, in life, you don’t know what’s around the corner.“What I love about this [show] is they’re all slightly at this point where they’re like: ‘I will do anything to find love; I’m hitting that stage of my life and I’m really ready to meet somebody and settle down.’“And they’ve taken a massive leap of faith. And I guess me having this operation was sort of very conducive to me accepting this show, because it felt quite like an adventure. And I do love love [and] being able to help people find that.”With the fashion for turning TV series,such as The Traitors, into live experiences, there is speculation that Stranded, created by the Scandinavian company Snowman Productions, could become a real-life singles dating holiday.Explore more on these topicsReality TVDavina McCallTelevisionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

And if they’re twice as big, they’ll be twice as difficult to deal with, and they’re going to move to reduce headcount.”The two firms expect their merger to create an “annualized synergy opportunity” worth $2.75bn. Samuelsen cited such savings cannot be achieved without reducing the workforce, a longstanding issue in the railroad industry.“I have had nothing but bad experiences running the TWU in dealing with freight rail. They appear to be unchanged from the infamous rail bosses of the 1880s,” he said, whenrailroad tycoons, dubbed robber barons during the Gilded Age due to their business practices, amassed immense wealth and power through control of the railroad industry. “They’re extremely powerful.”The Smart Transportation Division, the largest rail labor organization in the US, has alsoopposedthe merger over Union Pacific’s safety record and labor practices.Since the East Palestine derailment, a railroad safety bill hasstalledin Congress, despite JD Vance supporting it as a US senator, and the Trump administration hasalready demonstrateda strikingly more lax approach toward approving corporate mergers compared to the Biden administration.If they’re twice as big, they’ll be twice as difficult to deal with, and they’re going to move to reduce headcountJohn Samuelsen, Transport Workers Union presidentSix class I railroads currently control the majority of the rail network in the US: BNSF Railway, Union Pacific, Norfolk Southern, CSX, Canadian National Railway and CPKC, whichmergedfrom two separate railroad companies in 2023. The number of class I railroads in the US has dwindled from39in 1980.Nick Wurst, the general secretary of Railroad Workers United and a railroad freight conductor in Massachusetts, expressed concern with the power a merger of two class I railroad firms would yield to an already powerful industry – and prompt executives to try and “trim the fat” in their workforces.“It’s going to let them massively expand their negotiating power, not just with the shippers, with the customers, but also it’s going to expand their power in terms of negotiations with workers, and lobbying in Washington,” said Wurst. “I think it’s reasonable to anticipate that there’s going to be sort – of a hunt for redundancies. I don’t think it’s just going to affect union employees; it’s also going to affect management, too.”The news of a proposed merger has alsosparkedconcerns that other operators, such as BNSF and CSX, would move to merge in response.“When I heard about this merger, I was horrified for the simple fact that everything that’s happened in East Palestine points to the fact that these rail carriers have way too much power the way it is,” said Jeff Kurtz, a retired railroad worker at BNSF who had served as the legislative and safety director at the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen.The merger would make Union Pacific and Norfolk Southern “a lot more powerful”, he added, pointing to the 1996mergerbetween the Burlington Northern Railroad and the Santa Fe Railway, which formed BNSF. Benefits in existing union contracts were eliminated if they weren’t included in both, Kurtz recalled, or the lesser benefit was adopted and applied to the merged workforce.Everything that’s happened in East Palestine points to the fact that these rail carriers have way too much powerJeff Kurtz, retired BNSF railroad worker“Things will get worse,” he warned. “Right now, you’ve got these long trains, blocking crossings, cutting towns in half. Another thing that you might get with this merger is them moving terminals around, and moving people out of these small towns. There’s not going to be a lot of recourse for towns to handle this stuff.”Matt Weaver, a railroad worker, expressed concern that the merger would force workers to travel even further away from home.“How do you raise a family on that? What’s in the land of opportunity? It’s about being a father, being a mother and being there to raise your kids,” he said. “How can you do that when you’re at this point, it could be 2,000 miles away from home? How are they going to do that? It wears you out to think of the stress on the employee when they expect the same amount of production and they’ve cut since World War One, they’ve cut 95% of rail labor.”The class I railroad labor force has declined frommore than 450,000in 1980 toabout 122,000 workersin 2024, he noted. “None of these mergers have ever been good for the workers,” said Weaver. “That doesn’t serve the people.

The lawsuit, filed in a Texas court on Monday, accuses the companies of “a conspiracy to monopolize the markets for smartphones and generative AI chatbots”.Musk had earlier this monththreatened to sueApple and OpenAI, which makes ChatGPT, after claiming that Apple was “making it impossible” for any other AI companies to reach the top spot on its app store. Musk’s xAI makes the Grok chatbot, which has struggled to become as prominent as ChatGPT.Musk’s lawsuit challenges a key partnership between Apple and OpenAI that wasannounced last year,in which the device maker integrated OpenAI’s artificial intelligence capabilities into its operating systems. In claiming that their agreement “locked up markets”, Musk’s case is seeking to undo one of Apple’s most significant forays into AI and a marquee deal for OpenAI.“Defendants entered an unlawful agreement and conspiracy to leverage Apple’s monopoly power in the US smartphone market to maintain OpenAI’s monopoly power in generative AI chatbots,” the complaint states. It is also seeking to “recover billions in damages”.OpenAI rejected Musk’s allegations and framed the suit as part of his broader attacks against the company. “This latest filing is consistent with Mr Musk’s ongoing pattern of harassment,” an OpenAI spokesperson said.Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The lawsuit is the latest front in theongoing feudbetween Musk and Altman. The two tech billionaires founded OpenAI together in 2015, but have since had an increasingly public falling out which has frequently turned litigious.Musk left OpenAI after proposing to take over the company in 2018, and has since filed multiple lawsuits against the company over its plans to shift into a for-profit enterprise. Altman and OpenAI have rejected Musk’s criticisms and framed him as a petty, vindictive former partner.“We’re sad that it’s come to this with someone whom we’ve deeply admired – someone who inspired us to aim higher, then told us we would fail, started a competitor, and then sued us when we started making meaningful progress towards OpenAI’s mission without him,” OpenAI posted in a statement last year, following one of Musk’s lawsuits.The spat between Altman and Musk resurged earlier this month after the latter’s threat to sue Apple. Musk’s claims that Apple was manipulating the app store’s rankings to exclude other AI companies resulted in an exchange of posts between the two tech moguls challenging and insulting each other.“This is a remarkable claim given what I have heard alleged that Elon does to manipulate X to benefit himself and his own companies and harm his competitors and people he doesn’t like,” Altman posted in response to Musk’s claims that Apple was favoring OpenAI.OpenAI is currentlyeyeing a $500bn valuation, which would make it the most valuable privately held company, exceeding Musk’s SpaceX rocket maker which is the current title holder, at $350bn.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

Evergrande, by then China’s second-biggest property developer, wasunable to repay its $300bn in debtsand defaulted.A Hong Kong courtissued a winding-up order for Evergrandein January 2024, ruling that the company had failed to come up with a suitable debt repayment plan.Liquidators have made moves to recover creditors’ investments, includingfiling a lawsuit against PwCand its mainland Chinese arm for their role in auditing the debt-ridden developer.Another major developer,ChinaSouth City, was put into liquidation earlier in August and had share trading frozen at a capitalisation of HK$1.22bn (US$156m), just a tenth of its December 2020 market value of HK$13bn.National property sales and price growth slowed before values began to fall in September 2021, which left sales “at a standstill”, Evergrande said in its 2022 annual report.The downturnhas since deepenedand has yet to reach its bottom, with prices nearly a fifth lower across China in March, according to Bank for International Settlementsdata.When Evergrandecollapsed and froze trading in 2024, the group and its subsidiaries had about 1,300 projects under development in more than 280 cities, according to the liquidators’ August report.It also invested in electric vehicle production and served 3,000 projects through its property management business.In March 2024 it was ordered to pay a US$580m fineafter Beijing’s securities regulator said it had inflated its revenues by almost US$80bn in 2019 and 2020.The Chinese government has struggled torevive the falling property market, with the downturn not only slamming developers but dragging down steel prices andhousehold spending.Explore more on these topicsEvergrandeChinaReal estateChinese economyEconomicsAsia PacificShareReuse this content"

CEO Tim Cofer called it a “transformational moment” for the sector.“By creating two sharply focused beverage companies with attractive and tailored growth propositions and capital allocation strategies, we are poised to generate significant shareholder value in both the near and long term,” Cofer wrote in prepared remarks.But large chains likeStarbucksare suffering. Same-store sales, a key barometer of a retailer’s health, has fallen for six straight quarters at the Seattle coffee giant and its shares have tumbled 23% since early March.Dr Pepper Keurig is offsetting some declines with higher prices. In its last quarter, the company reported a 0.2% decline in coffee sales.For Keurig Dr Pepper, the soon-to-be separatedcoffeebusiness will have about $16bn in combined sales and the beverage business about $11bn, the companies said.The companies expect to save about $400m over three years because of the merger.The company that Keurig Dr Pepper is buying, JDE Peet’s, is based in Amsterdam, and also owns the brands L’OR, Jacobs, Pilao, OldTown, Super and Moccona.Once the two companies are separated, Cofer will become CEO of the cold beverage business, which will be based in Frisco, Texas. Keurig Dr Pepper’s chief financial officer, Sudhanshu Priyadarshi, will lead the coffee business, which will be located in Burlington, Massachusetts. Its international headquarters is in Amsterdam.Shares of Keurig Dr Pepper slumped 9% after the opening bell on Monday.Explore more on these topicsBusinessFood & drink industryCoffeeDonald TrumpTrump tariffsnewsShareReuse this content"

Moreover, the rules’ related documentation still requires further clarification,” the French operator said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

However, the president’s cynicism has hurt the values of its US projects.The stop-work order comes at a critical time for the Danish business as it seeks to raise money for its new projects. Earlier this month, it said it would seek to shore up its finances by selling new shares worth 60bn Danish kroner (£7bn) to existing investors.Prior to the fall on Monday, Ørsted shares had already dropped by more than 30% in the year to date.Pierre-Alexandre Ramondenc, an analyst at the research company AlphaValue, said the US government intervention could jeopardise the success of Ørsted’s fundraising plans.“The news came as a major shock and amounts to nothing less than political hostage-taking by the US administration, given the project’s advanced stage,” he said.Trump has along-held dislikeof offshore windfarms, which dates back at least 14 years to a dispute over North Sea wind turbines that were visible from one of his golf courses in Scotland.He has claimed that windfarms should not be allowed because they generate “the worst form of energy, the most expensive form of energy” and also “kill the birds”.

But, he adds, “we cannot do it the way our fathers did.”Boutaris is determined to keep producing in the region and keep the family business going but says “the curve is not looking good” as the climate crisis puts pressure on producers across the Mediterranean.Boutaris, who heads the Kir-Yianni wine producers’ group, is one of thousands of farmers in the south of Europe battling to continue producing on the lands their ancestors have farmed for decades, or even centuries, as increasingly extreme weather, such asthis summer’s wildfires, rage across Spain, France and Greece.Brazil issues last-ditch plea for countries to submit climate plans ahead of Cop30Read moreTheir struggles mean the price of wine, olives, citrus fruits and vegetables are expected to continue to rise, as droughts, flash floods and high temperatures affect traditional crops in the Mediterranean.View image in fullscreenStellios Boutaris has said he is determined to show that farming can still work in southern Europe.Photograph: Kir-Yianni EstateBoutaris is employing new tactics to tackle the problem, including installing irrigation and water storage and planting more vegetation among the vines to help the land hold more water and keep temperatures down. He is also buying higher land and seeking out different varieties of grapes which are more resilient to extreme weather.He has just invested €250,000 (£216,000) in irrigation and now plans to spend a further €200,000 (£173,000) on a project for 40 hectares of vineyards in Santorini.Producers acrossEuropewill be forced to pass on such extra costs to consumers, in the form of higher prices, he argues. “Cheap wine is not going to be easy to find. It used to be that the south of France, Spain and Greece produced cheap wine of Europe. Now it is going to be very difficult to compete on price,” he says.Shoppers are already feeling the effects, as droughts in Spain, Italy and Portugal, where the UK sources much of its fresh fruit and vegetables during autumn and winter, push up prices this summer, at a time when prices would usually fall.This summer even farmers in parts of the UK have beenhit by long dry spellsaffecting production of cereals, potatoes, carrots and broccoli, which are not usually irrigated.Things are expected to get far worse as a result of the climate crisis. In the EU, the average annual loss for crops is forecast to increase by up to two-thirds by 2050 to as much as €24.8bn, according to analysis by the European Investment Bank (EIB) and the European Commission.By 2050, the most severe increase in drought risk is expected in Spain, Italy and Greece with more than nine times as many days of severe drought conditions each year compared to 1990 under theIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s“middle of the road” projections.France, Italy, Spain and Romania are likely to see the largest absolute increases in crop losses – with average annual losses expected to increase by 64%, or more than €1bn (£866m), with drought a major factor, according to the EIB and commission’s report.In 2022, for example, maize yields were down 24% on the previous year across Europe with Spain bearing the largest proportion of losses followed by France, Italy and Romania.View image in fullscreenEnglish vineyards are seeing investment as more temperate areas struggle.Photograph: NyetimberDr Peter Alexander, a professor of global food systems at the University of Edinburgh, says it is already possible to see the northern march of crops within Europe, with champagne producers investing in the UK and maize growing in Scotland.British farmers are experimenting with crops such as haricot beans and chickpeas, which historically have been difficult to grow, in the hope that they may thrive in a warming climate. One farmer in Essex has even planted more than 1,000 olive trees with support from Belazu, the premium olive oil company.However, the more the climate crisis progresses the harder it becomes to adapt and the more costly it becomes. Alexander says this effect is already evident in more exotic crops, which require very specific growing conditions and are now under pressure, such as coffee and cocoa. “In high income countries they are available but less affordable,” he says.In southern Europe, family-owned farms are struggling to find the resources to fund adaptation to keep growing.“Already what we see is groves get abandoned and people can’t afford to be farmers any more,” says Sarah Vachon of the Citizens of Soil olive oil brand, which works with independent producers around the Mediterranean.She says farmers are looking at many ways to keep going, from irrigation to new varieties but “these are big investments for small farmers already living on the bread line and these things are difficult to get government funding for”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

But in order to conserve water, first it has to rain. We have had winter rains this year, but in the previous three years it has been a virtual drought.”With concerns about future supplies, Filippo Berio has invested in storage tanks to hold an extra 3,000 tonnes of oil in the past five years and temporarily rented space for 1,000 more, as well as turning to a wider array of sources for olive oil, including Latin America.Lambert van Horen, an analyst at Rabobank, says the financial group is predicting that there will be no increase in agricultural production per hectare in Europe in the coming five years, ending decades of improvement aided by increased efficiency and better fertiliser.However, that means higher prices. “In the last five years prices of fresh produce have kept up with inflation or have been even higher than general inflation. In the next five years we expect food again to at least follow general inflation,” he says.“Farmers will get higher prices and they need that because their inputs are getting more expensive.”That could involve building more shade houses or greenhouses where temperatures and water flows can be more controlled, whatever the climate, to building more storage.“There will be more costs because adaptation, especially when crops are not so valuable such as grains where the revenue per hectare is relatively low,” says van Horen.In Greece so far it has been a decent year for many wine producers after two tough years. Still, with wildfires raging, many small farmers are considering their futures.Boutaris is determined to carry on: “There has got to be a way to do it and I want to show it can be done.”Explore more on these topicsFarmingClimate crisisEuropefeaturesShareReuse this content"

What a buzzkill.Because it’s back, baby.Is this about employers forcing people back into the office, citing “culture” and “connection”, but mostly wanting to check employees aren’t slacking?It’s true that there’s been a push from big employers such asAmazonandTescoover the past year to get people back on site, but this is different: in a newBupa survey of 8,000 workers, 45% of gen Z respondents said they were considering looking for jobs with more social interaction.Interesting. Why?Because they’re lonely: 38% of them feel socially isolated because of their work circumstances; that’s more than other generations. “I specifically applied for roles with a physical office where I have supportive colleagues, can socialise at lunchtimes and meet friends in the evenings,” one gen Z worker explained.I thought they wanted to be TikTok content creators not corporate drones?Actually, the influencers were the loneliest of all: 45% said their work made them feel lonely and a third were considering returning to “full-time, traditional employment” in the next five years.Huh. You can tell they have never been in an office if they think it’s something to aspire to.Aren’t you excited about this infusion of new young blood? They’ll be a breath of fresh air!I’m fine with the old, stale, instant coffee and resentment-scented air. Young people in the office soundsloud and tiring.But the office is becoming the new hype place to be! Maybe they’ll start queueing outside? Telling you your spreadsheet “ate” and complimenting your suits as “Severancecore”?I doubt it. Didn’tanother recent surveyfind only one in10 young workers wanted to be in the office full-time?Yes, but even if they are only in a few days a week it would be fun.

Well pretending to work is a time-honoured tradition. With a bit of mentorship, it soundsas if they’ll fit right in. I could teach them to walk around holding a piece of paper for hours, unchallenged!That’s the spirit.

Might Alexander Isak have felt the tiniest bit guilty at the sight of his increasingly overwrought understudy, Anthony Gordon, missing a couple of extremely presentable chances before being sent off for a ridiculous first-half tackle on Virgil van Dijk?And how did Newcastle’s currently striking star striker assess Hugo ­Ekitiké’s attacking performance forLiverpool? Even as Isak continues to endeavour to engineer a move to Anfield, did he celebrate Will Osula’s unexpected late Newcastle leveller to make it 2-2? What, precisely, did he feel when the 16-year-old visiting substitute Rio Ngumoha won it for the champions in the 100th minute?Bruno Guimarães harnesses red mist to become Newcastle’s last man standingRead moreGiven that the Sweden striker was watching from up the road in Northumberland, we will never know, but one thing was abundantly clear: the emotions engendered by the ­summer’s longest and most ­acrimonious transfer saga provoked a night of compelling, sometimes downright wild drama. As Liverpool’s manager Arne Slot said afterwards: “I’m not sure it was a football match today.”By kick-off it had been dubbed “El Isako” and Ryan Gravenberch’s booking for a wince-inducing tackle on Bruno Guimarães swiftly set the tone as this 100mph rerun oflast season’s Carabao Cup finalopened in highly charged, almost anarchic mode.If Liverpool wanted revenge for that Wembley defeat, the sheer, feral fury of a Newcastle crowd incensed by Slot’s pursuit of Isak and Liverpool’s perceived audacity in hijacking Howe’s move for Ekitiké transmitted itself to an electrically charged home team.Before too long Gordon would self-destruct but, for a while, he rattled Liverpool. The England winger, once again deputising for Isak out of position at centre-forward, may not be exactly reliable in front of goal but he remains extremely clever at winning dangerous free-kicks. Accordingly Slot twice lost his cool after complaining that Gordon dives had earned Newcastle underserved set-pieces.View image in fullscreenVirgil van Dijk shows the injury on his right calf after the tackle by Anthony Gordon that earned the Newcastle striker a red card.Photograph: Daniel Chesterton/Offside/Getty ImagesIt was left to a deep-sitting Van Dijk and company to stay calm and slow the tempo at every opportunity. At times they lived dangerously and Alisson Becker looked relieved to see Gordon head fractionally over the bar from Harvey Barnes’s cross. But the impressive approach work of the excellent Sandro Tonali was repeatedly undone by the lack of a specialist striker.The directors’ box contained Newcastle’s chair, Yasir al-Rumayyan – making a rare visit from Riyadh – flanked by a sizeable, and serious looking delegation from the club’s owners, Saudi Arabia’s ­Public Investment Fund. On Monday afternoonsome members of that delegation joined ­Newcastle’s minority owner, Jamie Reuben, in visiting Isak at home to try to persuade him into a change of heart.Considering that earlier in the day Wolves had rejected a £50m bid from St James’ Park for their striker Jørgen Strand Larsen, the boardroom chat with Liverpool executives can hardly have been dull.Neither was a match that was ­initially dominated by a home side who, nonetheless, fell behind when an unsighted Nick Pope was beaten by ­Gravenberch’s low, slightly deflected shot from the edge of the area in the 35th minute.Pope enjoyed a reprieve when Mohamed Salah’s subtly curving cross proved just slightly too clever for a startled looking Ekitiké. But then an intervention by the video assistant referee resulted in Gordon’s ­dismissal for poleaxing Van Dijk with an unpleasant, unnecessary and utterly brainless tackle from behind.Given that it involved the boyhood Liverpool fan lunging into the back of the defender’s standing leg as Van Dijk attempted to clear the ball, ­Gordon could hardly complain.Howe’s players had arguably paid the price for playing on the edge. ­Initially all this black-and-white adrenaline had unnerved and ­unsettled Slot’s side but, not for the first time, Gordon carried things too far and imploded.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The Frenchman’s burst beyond Tonali and his pass to the left cued up Cody Gakpo. When the Dutchman’s ensuing shot was blocked, Ekitiké reacted first to the rebound, drilling an unstoppable shot past Pope.View image in fullscreenWilliam Osula (left) celebrates with Bruno Guimarães and Dan Burn after his 88th-minute equaliser.Photograph: Andy Buchanan/AFP/Getty ImagesEither side of their goals, Liverpool had taken surprisingly few touches in Newcastle’s area but their efficiency when it mattered most had hurt their hosts.Not that it was quite over just yet. When Tino Livramento curled a cross into the area, Guimarães capitalised on slapdash defending by Milos Kerkez to head Newcastle’s 10 men right back into things in the 57th minute.Suddenly Liverpool almost looked the team at a numerical disadvantage, but then injuries began stemming the tide of the black-and-white waves. Newcastle could certainly have done without losing Tonali, with a nasty looking shoulder injury, before the influential Joelinton limped off as Jacob Ramsey stepped off the bench to make his home debut following a £40m move from Aston Villa.Ramsey, though, was not the night’s most influential home ­substitute. That accolade belonged to Osula. The Denmark Under-21 ­forward may not be quite the ­finished article but he is at least a proper centre-forward and when Dan Burn overpowered Ibrahima Konaté in the tussle to meet Pope’s long kick, he nipped in, stretched out a boot and equalised with two minutes of ­normal time to go.Unfortunately for Howe a visiting replacement proved an even bigger gamechanger. Ngumoha marked hisPremier Leaguedebut by becoming the youngest scorer in Liverpool’s history after curling a sumptuous shot beyond Pope at the end of a gloriously fluent attacking move. Maybe Slot doesn’t need Isak after all.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueNewcastle UnitedLiverpoolmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

That was great. That was fun. It was good to see Shohei show his personality.”Ohtani didn’t speak to reporters after the game, but he didn’t need the heckler to tell him that he was 0-for-10 with two walks in the series before his 409ft homer off Yuki Matsui.His fellow Dodgers had already delivered by then, with rookie Dalton Rushing‘s tiebreaking three-run shot in the seventh inning sandwiched between clutch homers in back-to-back innings by Freddie Freeman.“He was just kind of talking to Shohei the whole game, so I’m glad Shohei was able to give him a little something else to cheer about,” Freeman said with a grin.Freeman and the rest of the Dodgers heard plenty of yapping from the stands during the weekend in the latest chapter of what may currently be the liveliest rivalry in the sport. The noise intensified as Los Angeles lost the first two games while managing just five combined hits – but the defending World Series champs still managed to head home smiling and even with the Padres at 74-57.When asked if the rivalry is the best in baseball, Rushing replied: “I think so. I think it’s pretty safe to say. You see the atmosphere we play in, whether it’s here or in LA. I think it’s pretty special. There’s something to it. There’s a lot of superstars on the field, and it’s fun to play in these games.”The Dodgers have won 11 of the past 12 NL West titles, while the Padres haven’t won the division since 2006. San Diego are closing in on their fourth playoff berth in six seasons during the longest run of sustained success in team history.Though the rivals won’t meet again in the regular season, both teams acknowledge they’ll be watching what the other does down the stretch.“We’re going to treat the next however many games until the regular season is over like we’re neck-and-neck with them,” Rushing said. “Whether we’re tied in the division or we’re eight games out, we’re going to treat it like it’s the same, and I think it’s a good thing. You hold a competitive edge finishing out the regular season, and that’s what you kind of carry into the postseason.”Explore more on these topicsShohei OhtaniMLBBaseballUS sportsLos Angeles DodgersSan Diego PadresnewsShareReuse this content"

Back in the late 90s I was working at the golf magazine Fore! when the deputy editor, Simon Caney, returned to the office after being thrashed 6&5 by a tiny eight-year-old who had shown him no mercy. His name? Tommy Fleetwood. Now the rest of the world knows that killer instinct exists, too.But Fleetwood’s FedEx Cup victory, his first in 164 events on thePGA Tour, also reinforced something else. Everyone loves Tommy. Right. Left. Maga. Liberal. Whatever. It doesn’t matter.At East Lake they were chanting his name as he lifted the trophy – while on X, Tiger Woods, Adam Sandler and Caitlin Clark all posted their support. Even on social media, so often a cesspit of anger and bile, the equivalent of a Christmas Day armistice broke out.Tommy Fleetwood wins Tour Championship to finally break US duckRead moreBack in 2023 a survey in Sportico found that PGA supporters were among the most rightward fanbases in sport, with 56% self-identified as “more conservative” compared with 44% who were “more liberal”. Yet in our hyper-polarised world, where sides are taken and battle lines drawn, Fleetwood is one of the few male sports stars for whom we universally root.How many others come to mind? Leo Messi, Carlos Alcaraz and Luke Littler, for sure. Scottie Scheffler and Justin Rose, too. Until last week I would have said Eberechi Eze as well. But after that my list soon dries up.Of course seeing the nearly man of golf finally break America was behind the vast outpouring of joy on Sunday. How could it not be? But Fleetwood’s reaction to his victory showed you why so many were willing him home in the first place.After he hit the winning putt he leaned back and screamed towards the heavens in an act of joy and catharsis, before the camera panned to Justin Rose and Shane Lowry, who were both celebrating. But before greeting his Ryder Cup teammates, Fleetwood went over to hug his stepson Oscar, who was sobbing away, and ask him: “Are you OK?”View image in fullscreenTommy Fleetwood embraces his stepson, Oscar, on the 18th green after claiming victory at East Lake.Photograph: Jared C Tilton/Getty ImagesYou can’t fake genuine. And that one small act told you everything you need to know about Fleetwood. Even in the moment of his greatest triumph, he was being human and thinking of others.Then again Fleetwood, the son of a roadworker from Southport who started playing at his local municipal course, has long shown us the type of person he is. When President Trump criticised the NHS in 2018, for instance, Fleetwood retweeted a post telling him to mind his own business. And then he made his feelings ever clearer in an interview in the Times shortly afterwards. “I thought what he said was absolute rubbish,” he said. “There are certain things you are proud of as a British citizen and the NHS is by far and away the No 1 thing. I’m a big believer.”Of course things got a bit hairy on Sunday. There was a wobble on holes 8, 9 and 10, and with Scheffler and Keegan Bradley mounting a charge you feared that history might repeat itself. If Fleetwood was nervous he certainly had plenty of time to think about it, too, given his playing partner, Patrick Cantlay, was dawdling even more than usual.Imagine what was going through Fleetwood’s mind. In the past seven years he had finished in the top five 29 times on the PGA without winning. No wonder that when he led by two shots with three holes to play, as he had at the Travelers and the St Jude Championship, he had the walk of a condemned man. Yet this time the nerve held.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It was classic Fleetwood, modest and self-effacing.Beforehand he had talked about taking the positives from every setback. That is what every sports star says, of course. But Fleetwood actually proved as good as his word.How he didn’t plunge into a doom‑spiral or weeks of self-pity should be a subject for a sports psychology textbook. And his victory also served as a pick‑me-up to the rest of us. Perhaps if you take enough shots at something, even when you are getting kicked in the teeth, the hard work will pay off.Either way, it always felt harsh for some to brand Fleetwood a choker, or – as in Paul Azinger’s case five years ago – demand that he win in the US to prove himself.The 34-year-old is, after all, a multiple winner on the DP World Tour and an Olympic silver medallist. He also gained four points out of five on his Ryder Cup debut in 2018 and earned the Cup-winning point in Rome in 2023. You don’t do that if your knees are always knocking under pressure.View image in fullscreenShane Lowry was among those keen to applaud the success of his Ryder Cup teammate Tommy Fleetwood.Photograph: Andrew J Clark/ISI Photos/Getty ImagesTrue, this wasn’t the biggest or most dramatic golfing victory of the year.Rory McIlroy at the Masterssewed up that award long ago. But it was, to these eyes, the most heartwarming: the equivalent of a John Lewis Christmas advert that makes you feel better every time you think about it.Of course it will be very different when it comes to the Ryder Cup in four weeks’ time. President Trump will be there. The crowd will be pumped up and baying for blood. And there certainly won’t be any “Tommy! Tommy!” chants.But for now we can all rejoice in having watched Fleetwood break the curse.

Why are you shaking? He wants to go home guys, he doesn’t like to be here. He gets paid by the match, not by the hour.”Although Medvedev then returned to the baseline, he continued to encourage the reaction of the crowd and it was more than six minutes before Bonzi finally hit his serve.Medvedev went on to win the point, that set, and the next, to pull himself back into the contest only for Bonzi to repeat his Wimbledon victory against the Russian, who has now lost in the opening round of a grand slam tournament for the third time in a row.Medvedev placed the blame on the crowd after the 6-3, 7-5, 6-7 (5), 0-6, 6-4 defeat, which finished in the early hours, saying: “What I say and what I do, in my head, I want to do worse, and I cannot because there are rules, because we’re on a tennis court.View image in fullscreenDaniil Medvedev shows his disdain for the chair umpire, Greg Allensworth, in New York.Photograph: Adam Hunger/AP“So I just expressed my emotions, my unhappiness with the decision, and then the crowd did what they did without me asking them too much, and it was fun to witness.”The 29-year-old also repeatedly yelled out: “What did Reilly Opelka say?” – the American player called Allensworth the worst umpire on tour after an incident in a match ­earlier this season. Medvedev declined to speak more about Allensworth, saying: “I’m ­getting a big fine enough, so if I speak, I’m in big trouble, so I’m not going to speak. Not everyone knows what I talked about when I said Reilly. Reilly got fined big-time for this, so I’m going to get a big fine too.”Bonzi was unhappy with the behaviour of Medvedev, saying: “Daniil started it, and he put oil on the fire. He went crazy with the crowd. Honestly, I never saw that.”View image in fullscreenFrance’s Benjamin Bonzi cups an ear to the Flushing Meadows crowd after his victory.Photograph: Eduardo Muñoz/ReutersIt appeared that the incident would help Medvedev to avoid another shock defeat, but it was Bonzi who managed to emerge the stronger player in the fifth set, with his Russian opponent sitting disconsolately in his chair at the end of the contest and ­smashing his racket repeatedly.Bonzi, who is ranked 51, said: “I’m very proud of myself, the scenario of the match, the match point in the third. Then Daniil playing great and taking full advantage in the fourth. I was not in my best physically in the fifth. I tried to fight very hard to give all I had.

One of the elements that makes them so hard to beat is that beating them seems so inconceivable. Even when they hit a bad run, the expectation is always that at some point they will rediscover their form. To some extent,Manchester Citydid that last season. As miserable as much of the campaign was, after losing to Nottingham Forest at the beginning of March, they put together a run of 10 games unbeaten and ended up third – even if defeat to Crystal Palace in the FA Cup final demonstrated the shortcomings that remain.That game showcased City’s flatness at times going forward but also a strange openness at the back that was apparent again in the4-3 defeat to Al-Hilalin the Club World Cup. Pep Guardiola sides, given how high their line is, will always be susceptible to direct balls played in behind them if something goes awry with the press; it’s an inevitable part of the risk-reward of that style of play.Even in the 4-0 win over Wolves on the opening weekend, there were signs in the early stages of a potential weakness to that sort of tactic. It was just that flaw that led to Richarlison breaking the offside trap and crossing for Brennan Johnson to open the scoring forSpurs at the Etihad on Saturday. Spurs’s second goal, though, was just as worrying: goalkeeper James Trafford played an inexplicable pass to Nico González’s wrong foot under pressure at the top of his own box. It wasn’t an error of execution so much as one of conception. If it were a one-off, that might not necessarily be of too much concern, but it was very similar to an error Trafford made in Burnley’s defeat at Crystal Palace the season before last, leading to a red card for Josh Brownhill.Ederson was the perfect goalkeeper for Guardiola, being both good at the traditional aspects of goalkeeping and an exceptional passer of the ball. It’s perhaps an understated feature of Guardiola’s success how fortunate he has been in his goalkeepers: inheriting Víctor Valdés at Barcelona and Manuel Neuer at Bayern, then signing Ederson at City. While he, or City, deserve credit for identifying a talent like that from Benfica, it came after an error the previous season in replacing Joe Hart with Claudio Bravo.Although Ederson only turned 32 earlier this month, there was a sense last season that he was on the wane. There were, for instance, two big errors late in the first leg of the Champions League knockout tie against Real Madrid, and Guardiola preferred Stefan Ortega for certain games. Given his high wages and apparent desire for a big payday in Saudi Arabia, it’s perhaps no huge surprise that Ederson should be nearing the exit. What is surprising is the profile of players lined up to replace him.In terms of his passing, Ederson’s stats remained strong last season. Despite an average of 5.3 long balls per game, he still averaged over 86% pass completion, registering four assists. Trafford last season played 4.3 long balls per game in the championship – which at least in theory means he was playing more straightforward passes – yet his pass completion rate was just 70%. In thePremier Leaguethe season before, it was 62%, albeit with 6.5 long balls per game.City have reportedly agreed personal terms with Gianluigi Donnarumma, who has surprisingly found himself outside Luis Enrique’s plans at Paris Saint-Germain. Further negotiation is required on a fee, but this seems a strikingly odd move for City. Donnarumma is a fine shot-stopper and has made a habit of match-winning displays in the biggest games, but he has nothing like Ederson’s long-range passing. Although he had an 85% pass completion rate in Ligue 1 last season, that was with an average of only 2.6 long balls per game. That might suggest Guardiola is looking to go back to basics, to a shorter-passing, more possession-based style – but that would go against the recent trend both of his football and the wider game towards something less risk-averse and more direct.In fact, one of the features that stood out in the game against Wolves was how quickly City’s midfield tried to play the ball forward. Tijjani Reijnders, in particular, thrived. He was significantly less effective against Spurs, with a midfield that harassed him, gave him no space, and saw his pass completion drop from 88.3% to 81.4%.City have won only one of their last five at home against Spurs, so in that sense Saturday’s result was nothing unexpected. What it demonstrated, though, was that a team needs to do more than beat Wolves handsomely to prove it is back. Guardiola’s rebuild of City remains a work in progress.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Rod Wallace pounced on an Erik Thorstvedt error to score the first and Lee Chapman added a fifth from Cantona’s lay-off, but in between it was all about the Frenchman. First he volleyed in a misplaced clearance from Justin Edinburgh, then he headed home David Batty’s cross, before he added his third with another volley.But after a 4-0 defeat to Manchester City in November was followed by elimination from the League Cup by Watford, the manager Howard Wilkinson left Cantona out for a 3-0 win over Arsenal, offering as an excuse a fictitious groin strain. A furious Cantona demanded a transfer andsoon joined Manchester United. Wilkinson seemed almost relieved to be rid of a turbulent player, but it was Cantona who inspired Alex Ferguson’s Manchester United to their first league title in 26 years.This is an extract from Soccer with Jonathan Wilson, a weekly look from the Guardian US at the game in Europe and beyond.Subscribe for free here.Have a question for Jonathan?

He’s been respectable against the top teams in England, with a win at the Etihad, a draw at Anfield and a win on penalties against Arsenal. But he’s been hopeless when faced with opponents from mid-table. Last season, after taking over in November, Amorim supervised 14 league games against clubs that ended up between seventh and 17th. United won two, drew two and lost 10, scraping eight points out of a possible 42. One of those two wins was at Craven Cottage, a streaky 1-0. Here, again, they needed luck to take the lead as Leny Yoro got away with a two-hands push on Calvin Bassey; this time they blew it, and they couldn’t complain. United had been the better team for 20 minutes, Fulham for about 75.Tim de LisleMatch report:Fulham 1-1 Manchester United2Grealish puts his best foot forwardDavid Moyes’ instruction to Jack Grealish was fairly simple but will have come as a blessed relief to the on-loan Everton winger after two seasons of torment atManchester City. “I just want Jack to take people on and be positive, he has great ability to take the ball forward,” said the Everton manager, who hopes to improve his options on the opposite flank this week with the signing of Tyler Dibling from Southampton. “The boy who we saw playing for Manchester City in the year they won the treble is a really exciting player. I hope we can get him back. He didn’t want to come off after 60 minutes. No chance. He wanted it. He probably feels he has something to prove.” Grealish proved he can still shape Premier League games with a sparkling home debut for Everton. The 29-year-old last produced an assist for City in September 2024 but delivered two to mark Hill Dickinson Stadium’s grand Premier League opening. Questions about his appetite are starting to disappear.Andy HunterMatch report:Everton 2-0 BrightonView image in fullscreenJack Grealish applauds the fans following his fine start at Hill Dickinson Stadium.Photograph: Peter Byrne/PA3Glasner’s tactics continue to bear fruitAmid all the talk about Ruben Amorim’s 3-4-2-1 shape and its pluses and minuses, it’s often forgotten that there is another devotee of the formation in the Premier League, one whose side seem rather more comfortable in the formation. AtCrystal Palace, as at Eintracht Frankfurt, Oliver Glasner has constructed a side who seem more than the sum of their parts, more comfortable playing on the break perhaps, but a reliable and consistent Premier League presence. Although they ran out of steam late on against Forest, Palace’s goal showed how the system can work and how reliant it is on the wing-backs. Tyrick Mitchell, the left wing-back, got forward, crossed and, although the ball was cleared, it was worked to the right. Daniel Muñoz was in an advanced position and, with Forest’s rearguard having been dragged the other way, found himself unmarked. His cross was then turned in by Ismaïla Sarr for the opener.Jonathan WilsonMatch report:Crystal Palace 1-1 Nottingham Forest4Richarlison proving worth for FrankAfter his two-goal showing againstBurnley, Richarlison was a huge factor again in Tottenham’s fine triumph at Manchester City. Having been reportedly touted as a makeweight in the Eberechi Eze deal that never was, the Brazilian was in spiky form afterwards when referencing a chat with Thomas Frank, the new Spurs manager. “It was very important,” the Brazilian striker said. “Since I got here, every time the transfer window opens, my name is circled as one who could leave – going back to Brazil or wherever. But I’ve always been focused on Tottenham and I’ve never had a conversation about leaving. I’m in a good moment. I hope to continue working hard and getting the opportunity to give my best. Now I want to be able to continue like this and play like this.”Jamie JacksonMatch report:Manchester City 0-2 Tottenham5Zubimendi shows Gunners’ new approachArsenal have a new weapon in their armoury this season. Against Leeds, they caused problems with an aggressive counterpress. The hosts should have taken the lead when Martín Zubimendi, who is supposed to be the deepest midfielder, read an attempt from Leeds to play out from the back. Viktor Gyökeres failed to take advantage but the ploy soon worked. Zubimendi’s midfield partner Declan Rice was involved, stepping in to win possession. Rice’s tackle fed the ball to Zubimendi, who was in close attendance. Zubimendi collected and passed to Jurriën Timber, who sent Bukayo Saka through to score. It was an encouraging sign for Mikel Arteta, and Leeds could not cope with the smothering tactics. Arsenal sat on too many 1-0 leads last season. There were too many home draws and dropped points from winning positions. Arteta has the toughest defence in thePremier League, but his team have to become more assertive if they are to win the title.Jacob SteinbergMatch report:Arsenal 5-0 Leeds6Silva strikes again with his changesThere are good draws and bad draws. After two games,Fulhamhave two satisfying ones: a pair of 1-1s, away at Brighton and home to Manchester United. Drawing with Ruben Amorim’s misfiring team may not sound like much, but on United’s previous eight visits to Craven Cottage, Fulham had lost every time. This time they went 1-0 down and, just like on the south coast, Marco Silva saved the day with a substitution. Rodrigo Muniz got the equaliser against Brighton, about as late as he could have. Emile Smith Rowe got the equaliser here, about as early as he could have: 90 seconds after coming on, he met Alex Iwobi’s cross with a deft finish. It was very Fulham. A third of their league goals since the start of last season have come from subs – 19 out of 56. Silva is either a genius at in-game management, or not so hot when picking his starters.TdLskip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Villa have problems in attack and nowhere is that more evident than on either flank. As he was for their goalless opener against Newcastle, John McGinn was deployed on the right wing, with Morgan Rogers on the other. Both tended to drift inside, offering precious little width. Evann Guessand looked lively when he came on for his debut, but 15 minutes was insufficient time to work with. The Ivorian international cannot be far off a start, based on Villa’s recent troubles. Unai Emery is seeking reinforcements over the next week; he needs to procure a winger or two, otherwise they will be all too easy to nullify this season.Ben BloomMatch report:Brentford 1-0 Aston VillaView image in fullscreenEvann Guessand (right) goes at Brentford’s Aaron Hickey during a lively showing.Photograph: Adam Davy/PA8Iraola keeps cool amid turbulent summerBournemouth have been mined for £200m-plus of talent this summer, but to Andoni Iraola’s credit, it is hard to spot the difference between last season’s team and this iteration.Bournemouthbuilt on a promising performance in defeat at Liverpool with victory at home to Wolves. Five new players featured, including the debutant Amine Adli, a £25m purchase from Bayer Leverkusen, while Eli Junior Kroupi made another appearance off the bench. The hosts were organised if not outstanding, the early signs encouraging. Iraola suggested the defender Bafodé Diakité, another of those new additions, finished the game stronger than he started. “We’ve had a lot of changes,” Iraola said. “Amine and Junior Kroupi were doing the right things but not always synchronised. They need to know their teammates and we need to know them better. I think the more time we play together, the better we will be.”Ben FisherMatch report:Bournemouth 1-0 Wolves9Mejbri leads the way for grafting ClaretsIt seems unlikely Burnley’s inevitable relegation battle will be based on outplaying other teams. Discipline and graft will be the key components of Scott Parker’s plan. AgainstSunderland, they enjoyed a healthy share of possession but chances were limited. In the knowledge of what his team is about, Hannibal Mejbri embodied the work ethic demanded by the home fans and his manager. The Tunisian midfielder was relentless in putting pressure on opponents, chasing lost causes and generally irritating anyone in a black shirt. Often players who come through the Manchester United academy are gifted with natural ability, but fall down when it comes to backing it up with the effort required to reach the top. Mejbri had to drop down to the Championship to kickstart his career after having his path blocked at Old Trafford. He looks determined to show he can cope with Premier League football, and will be hoping his team can do the same.Will UnwinMatch report:Burnley 2-0 Sunderland10Potter must make Hammers horribleGraham Potter wants to move West Ham to a style based on dominant possession, but does not have the players to make it work. It is time to go back to basics. West Ham were humbled by Sunderland on the opening day and confirmed that they are relegation candidates during their pathetic defeat byChelseaon Friday night. The hosts did not run, press or fight. They did not compete. They let crosses come into the box and did not defend them. They gave up three soft goals from set pieces. They are using a back five but are still easy to break down. Potter’s system means their ponderous midfield is outnumbered by three to two. The manager needs an urgent rethink after a slow, confused transfer window. He somehow has to make West Ham horrible. Forget about trying to play entertaining football because this is already a fight for survival.JSMatch report:West Ham 1-5 ChelseaPosTeamPGDPts1Arsenal2662Tottenham Hotspur2563Chelsea2444Nottm Forest2245Liverpool1236Man City2237Sunderland2138Everton2139AFC Bournemouth2-1310Brentford2-1311Burnley2-1312Leeds2-4313Fulham20214Crystal Palace20215Newcastle10116Man Utd2-1117Aston Villa2-1118Brighton2-2119Wolverhampton2-5020West Ham2-70Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueTen talking points from the weekend footballArsenalTottenham HotspurChelseaNottingham ForestLiverpoolManchester CityfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Treading such a fine line is easier said than done, and just a single goal, even one on the opening day of the season, is enough to trigger a meltdown of epic proportions.Ludovic Blas’s injury-time winner for Rennes in the first game of the season was the trigger for what has now been termed by French media as“The Rabiot Affair”. It is an episode that has already put paid to Jonathan Rowe’s time at the club. The England Under-21 international was involved in a bust-up with Adrien Rabiot following the 1-0 defeat by Rennes. The sporting director, Medhi Benatia, confirmed that punches were thrown, while the club president, Pablo Longoria, spoke of “incredible violence”. Between teammates and staff attempting to break up the fight and one of OM’s youngsters, Darryl Bakola, fainting in the dressing room, it was a scene befitting a Renaissance painting.While Rabiot’s mother and agent, Véronique, attempted to downplay the incident, pointing out that “no one ended up in hospital”, Marseille took a hardline stance. Rabiot and Rowe were initially temporarily suspended before an announcement on Monday revealed the pair had been transfer-listed. The reason given was the pair’s “unacceptable behaviour in the dressing room after the match against Stade Rennais”. However, just hours prior, it was Véronique who broke the news, via the radio station RTL. She was told that the official reason was Rabiot’s “lack of commitment” since the club’s pre-season training camp in the Netherlands.‘You tried to kill us’: Real Oviedo make emotional return to La LigaRead moreVéronique called Marseille “pathetic” and accused them of lying. The family lawyer, Romuald Palao, added: “When the club indicates that the player’s behaviour has changed recently, they are lying. It’s a bit of a fabricated story.”It certainly is at odds with Longoria’s comments, made in an OM documentary released at the end of July. “Adrien is special. I would say that he is the best person I have seen in a dressing room in my career. He is an example of how you should work,” said the Marseille president. The dissonance is striking, and the lack of clarity, the multiplication of narratives and counter-narratives have bred a circus. It isn’t Marseille’s first.It comes back to the fervour and passion around the club, which is embraced and posited as its greatest strength. Managerial choices in recent years have only exacerbated that trope. Jorge Sampaoli, Igor Tudor, Gennaro Gattuso and now Roberto De Zerbi – all have held the post since 2021 and you certainly wouldn’t describe any as calm or level-headed.Not that going the opposite way has decreased the temperature at a Vélodrome that is always on the verge of eruption. Marcelino, who marked a departure from his hot-headed predecessors, lasted just seven games before being chased out of the club by the ultras, accused of levelling death threats at the Spaniard and the man who brought him in, Longoria. The latter temporarily stepped back from his role before returning.OM reverted to their tried, albeit not exactly trusted, strategy. In came De Zerbi the following summer, marking a shift back towards those more, let’s say expressive managers. His tumultuous debut season was marked by flare-ups, as shown in the club’sSans Jamais Rien Lâcher(Never Give Up) documentary. Ostensibly a tale of unison and of Marseille’s “mentality-monster” mindset, it nonetheless gave glimpses into the less savoury aspects of De Zerbi’s management. One scene in the documentary saw him lambast new signing Ismaël Koné for taking too many touches in training. The Italian sent the Canadian back to the dressing room, telling him to “call his agent” on the way, leading to a confrontation between the pair.View image in fullscreenRoberto De Zerbi goes to embrace Marseille’s Pierre-Emile Højbjerg and Paris FC’s Maxime Lopez after his side’s win.Photograph: Alexandre Dimou/ReutersBeyond that, there were the threats of resignation, the late-seasonritiroin Rome, and the now-overlooked Chancel Mbemba situation, which saw the defender relegated to the reserves before leaving on a free earlier this summer. Amid the success, incarnated in a second-place finish inLigue 1, there is conflict – an almost necessary byproduct.There is a certain irony in Marseille’s “Droit au But” (“Straight to the Goal”) slogan; their route to it is always meandering, and this season promises to be no different. This week alone provided a snapshot into a bipolar club. Earlier in the week, Rabiot’s career at OM looked over, his mother said it was unthinkable that he would ever wear the jersey again.Yet on Saturday, a 5-2 win over Paris FC lifted the clouds that lingered over the Vél and post-match, De Zerbi extended an olive branch. “I haven’t spoken with Pablo [Longoria] or Medhi [Benatia], but even if he made a mistake, I hope there are conditions to repair things,” said the coach. The player remains – officially – on the transfer list, although it is our understanding that an apology from Rabiot could open the door to him remaining at the club; Rowe is already out the door, having completed a move to Bologna.The loss of both players, particularly Rabiot, decreases the quality of the squad. “To protect the institution, we have to make decisions where we are the victims,” says Benatia. OM are indeed a victim of this episode, in this apparently necessary act of self-sabotage, but more than that, they are a victim of their own culture and ideology, which intrinsically gives rise to volatility. Volcanoes do erupt, and Marseille is never dormant.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Luis Enrique’s side, following their late finish to last season, only began pre-season training 10 days before the return of Ligue 1. Two lethargic performances are the direct consequence of that, while Luis Enrique also pointed to the surprisingly poor state of the Parc des Princes pitch as a mitigating factor in what was an underwhelming performance, marked by another missed penalty, this time from Ousmane Dembélé. Fabián Ruiz’s second-half strike saw PSG over the line. Winning in style was a hallmark of this team last season, but this physically diminished side is showing itself capable of winning ugly, too, in these difficult opening weeks of the season.View image in fullscreenFabián Ruiz after scoring Paris Saint-Germain’s winner.Photograph: Abdullah Firas/ABACA/ShutterstockRetirement from international football, coupled with a move to LAFC, looked to signal the end of Olivier Giroud’s career in Europe last summer. He wasn’t exactly prolific in the MLS, netting just five goals in 38 appearances, but with Jonathan David and Chuba Akpom leaving Lille, there was a need for attacking reinforcements. His meagre goal return in the US didn’t dissuade LOSC from making the move, even if the move was greeted with a degree of scepticism.However, he has been rolling back the years, netting two neatly taken goals, including an injury-time winner against Monaco on Sunday.Les Bleus’ all-time top scorer has rarely been prolific, despite an impressive catalogue of goals. But on his return to France, he is bringing more than just experience and link-up play to a Lille side that was crying out for someone to step up after a summer in which they were stripped of their assets. Giroud, as he so often was for France, is proving to be that man again, as he approaches his 39th birthday.PosTeamPGDPts1Lyon2462Toulouse2363PSG2264Strasbourg2265Lille2146Lorient2337Marseille2238Monaco2139Nice21310Lens20311Angers20312Auxerre2-1313Rennes2-3314Brest2-2115Nantes2-2016Le Havre2-3017Paris FC2-4018Metz2-40Explore more on these topicsLigue 1European club footballMarseillefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Photographs by Pablo GarciaMon 25 Aug 2025 10.50 EDTLast modified on Mon 25 Aug 2025 18.56 EDTShare“When the players went out, they were like ‘pfff, what a great atmosphere’,” Xabi Alonso said at the close of a night so long-awaited many didn’t make it, and many of those who did were actually experiencingprimerafor the first time. At the north end of the Carlos Tartiere, Real Oviedo’s fans prepared to reveal another gigantic work of art, 1,800 square metres oftifosent tumbling across the terrace. Beneath the west stand, the city’s bagpipers got ready to play theAsturian anthem. Near the tunnel, Elena and Carlos, the embodiment of an entire generation, waited to kick it all off. And everywhere, in the city and the stadium, there was blue. Into it all, Real Madrid stepped on Sunday night. And, their manager said, it was “spectacular”.They had missed it. The last time Madrid had been to Oviedo was 10 June 2001, the last first division game in the Tartiere. That day, a fortnight after Oviedo had beaten Barcelona at the Camp Nou, they drew 1-1 with Vicente del Bosque’s side, Santi Solari scoring. “I prefer to forget it,” Veljko Paunovic says, but he can’t. “We missed so many chances; I had two, one hit the bar.” A win and Oviedo would have been safe; instead, seven days later they lost 4-2 at Mallorca and were relegated. It took 24 years to return toprimera, nine days more to do so at home. Coincidence, or perhaps a kind of closure, decided it would be against the same team as the last time, 8,841 days later.Another 168 teams have been there since, many of whom you probably haven’t heard of, all of which Oviedo can now be proud of: Pumarín, Atlético Astorga, Colloto. Montañeros, Condal de Noreña, Real Titánico. Or tiny CD Mosconia, even though there may be no goal that meant as much as the one Kily Álvarez scored against them. When Madrid last came, Paunovic was an Oviedo midfielder; now he is the manager, the manwho won promotion toprimerain June, immediately messaging the teammates who went down with him in 2001. “It’s been very emotional,” he said, “this is like closing a circle, repaying a debt. It transcends football.”View image in fullscreenFans overlooking the Carlos Tartiere Stadium.View image in fullscreenFlares are lit as supporters descend on the ground.View image in fullscreenArriving ahead of kick-off for the club’s first top-flight match in 24 years.View image in fullscreenWalking into the stadium.Football always does, and on Sunday night it was felt, even by Madrid’s players. This is not justonce-big team gets relegated and takes too long to return, so long that loads of the Oviedo fans who sang about doing so never saw them play inprimerain the first place and countless more didn’t live to see it happen. It is not that Oviedo fell in 2001, it is that they kept falling. Not just that they are in the first division now but that theyare, not just that they might not have made it back but that they might not have made it at all. The last time they faced Madrid was against their C team. And it might have been the last time they ever faced anyone.Before this weekend’s game Oviedo produced a matchday poster that portrayed the two teams as old acquaintances crossing paths again. “Tell me, how’s it been going … ” the message says. At the top of the image, Real Madrid lift another European Cup. At the bottom, Real Oviedo’sformer goalkeeper Rafa Ponzo stands in the mud. Since 2001, while Oviedo have been away, Madrid have won 11 leagues and seven Champions Leagues. Oviedo have been down to the second division, second division b – an 82-team league of four regional divisions – andtercera, where there are more than 350 teams across 17 divisions. They have been relegated two divisions in the same season, had an owner on the run from Interpol and politicians trying to kill them off. Twice they were on the verge of folding, gone for ever. Which was when the fans came in, and which is why this was much more than just a promotion, a first division homecoming.Instead of coming back up after relegation in 2001, they went down again two years on, from the second division to the second division b. Worse, debts spiralled, reaching 7bn pesetas (€42m), the list of creditors headed by the tax office, Betis, bank, and social security. When players reported the club for unpaid salaries, an extra division was added to their fall, sent down totercera. They also started the following season on minus-six points. If they started it at all. The headline in one local paper said it all. “It’s over.”“All that’s left is to sign the death certificate,” said the local mayor, Gabino de Lorenzo, and he was keen to do that. “Given the imminent disappearance of professional football in the city,de jure and de facto,” a draft agreement began, the council invited the local amateur club Astur to take their place. Astur changed their name to Oviedo ACF, their colours to Oviedo’s colours, their badge to something near-identical to Oviedo’s. They signed Oviedo’s record appearance maker. The council promised Astur a €91,000 subsidy and the use of the Tartiere. Newspapers in the mayor’s pocket backed the project, talked up full houses that weren’t full and popular support that didn’t exist, something tin-pot dictator in the tone. Sample line: “Gabino received an improvised homage with a huge ovation when he arrived at the ground”.View image in fullscreenBagpipers play the Asturian anthem before the match.View image in fullscreenA proud supporter.View image in fullscreenA huge tifo unfurled before kick-off.View image in fullscreenPassion in the stands.As it turned out, it was what Oviedo needed – something to go to war for, a cause to defend, anger to fuel it, an enemy to take on. “The poison cured you,” as one Oviedo song goes. Astur were the clone, the freak; Real Oviedo were therealOviedo, and there was a reawakening, a rebellion.Led by president Manolo Lafuente fans answered the call: they brought generators, cut grass, painted stands, and started calling season ticket holders one by one, putting together homemade membership cards. Eventually there were 11,700 of them. In their entire time down in what they came to call the “mud” – a word used metaphorically and literally – Oviedo never had less than 10,000. They built a team too, with a skeleton staff, only six of 40 remaining. The entire squad had gone. So had youth players Juan Mata, Santi Cazorla and Adrián López, forced out amid the chaos. They had no hot water, no electricity and no players but within two weeks they had a team and it was theirs, an identity forged, a sense of belonging. It was precarious but they played, starting with that win over CD Mosconia, and they were proud. Defeated, the city council eventually quietly dropped Astur.Then it went wrong again. A new owner arrived in 2006, an apparent saviour. Wanted for two counts of fraud, Alberto González went missing. In 2012 Oviedo were again on the verge of folding. An interim board – heroes all – had a plan, one last roll of the dice. Again fans rose, backed this time by supporters from around the world. An SOS went out and they responded. In the midst of it, Oviedo played Real Madrid C. That day thousands marched to the ground. 20,500 were at the game, in the third tier. Real Madrid C’s players brought shares. Their club underwrote €100,000 worth. In two weeks, 36,962 people in 86 countries had brought shares. Watching the phenomenon spread, the Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim brought shares, taking Oviedo over the threshold, its future secured. In 2022, some of those were sold to the Pachuca group.In 2003, as it left Oviedo to die, the city council had declared that the Astur project would “return football in Oviedo to the place it deserves to be”; 22 years on, 24 years after they departed the top flight, it happened: not the way they wanted, but the way everyone else did. Sprinting on to the pitch was Cazorla who had been forced out by the crisis and finally played his first game for his boyhood club at 38, then took them toprimeraat 40. On local radio Miguel Fernandi, the voice of Oviedo through the muddy years, met the playoff final whistle with: “You tried to kill us, you tried to assassinate us, you tried to replace us, and 24 years later, we’re inprimera.”Quick GuideLa Liga resultsShowOviedo 0-3 Real Madrid, Villarreal 5-0 Girona, Real Sociedad 2-2 Espanyol, Osasuna 1-0 Valencia, Mallorca 1-1 Celta Vigo, Atlético Madrid 1-1 Elche, Levante 2-3 Barcelona, Real Betis 1-0 AlvesWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Where, on Sunday night, they lost 3-0 against Real Madrid.

Even their positions were practically identical, the Italian cutting in from the right as the Scotsman attacked the six-yard box.McTominay’s finish was less dramatic this time around, a headerinstead of a scissor-kick, but he dispatched it with equal conviction. Serie A’s Most Valuable Player in 2024-25, scoring the league’s first goal of 2025-26. “Winning the Scudetto changes nothing,” he had said in one interview earlier this month. “We need to recapture and maintain that mentality we found last year.”Talk about living your values. McTominay led by furious example, covering ground and menacing Sassuolo’s defence. After scoring, it was he who broke up theNeroverdi’s attempted response, he who took the next shot and he again who rattled the crossbar with an effort from outside the box. McTominay later attempted to return the favour for Politano with a low centre, but his teammate’s shot was deflected on to a post.European football: Mbappé and Vinícius fire Real Madrid past OviedoRead moreThis was supposed to be a day to marvel at Kevin De Bruyne’s Serie A debut. Napoli’s signing of the Belgium international, and two-time Premier League player of the year, was this summer’s biggest transfer coup. Even in pre-season, his presence drew sellout crowds to sleepy towns for uncompetitive friendlies. De Bruyne confessed to finding it all “a bit weird”.Perhaps McTominay has helped him to settle. The Naples-published newspaper Il Mattino reported them as being “inseparable”. They certainly appear to have acquired an on-pitch understanding, rotating positions seamlessly on Saturday in a more liquid Napoli formation than the ones we watched for most of last season.Notionally, this was a 4-1-4-1, with McTominay flanking De Bruyne on the left, Politano outside Frank Anguissa on the right and Stanislav Lobotka shielding the defence. In practice, McTominay, De Bruyne and the centre-forward Lorenzo Lucca swapped places regularly. The latter dropped so far at times that he wound up in places you might expect to find a full-back.Was this design, or was Lucca trying too hard to show what he could do in the absence of an injured Romelu Lukaku? Who knows. What we can say is that De Bruyne played well and scored Napoli’s second goal, albeit slightly by accident.View image in fullscreenKevin De Bruyne leaps into the air after his free-kick doubles Napoli’s lead at Sassuolo.Photograph: Ciro De Luca/ReutersHis 57th-minute free-kick was swung into a dangerous area from the left touchline but sailed over the head of the 6ft 7ins Lucca. Sassuolo’s goalkeeper, Stefano Turati, hesitated, perhaps anticipating a touch, allowing the ball to hop past him into the net.De Bruyne might have had an earlier assist, too, but Amir Rrahmani fired wide after being sent through on goal. If McTominay was still the star of Napoli’s show, the new Belgian cast member did shine in a supporting role.The game ended 2-0, a confident start to thePartenopei’s title defence. Sassuolo, Serie B champions last season, had lined up with a trio of proven goalscorers in Domenico Berardi, Andrea Pinamonti and Armand Laurienté. None of them got a sniff.Even in post-game remarks, Napoli’s players were reading from the same script. De Bruyne said he was adjusting to a “very different way of working in Italy” but insisted that “I need to adapt to them, not them to me”. McTominay laughed off the suggestion he might have tips for his new teammate, saying: “He doesn’t need any advice. I need advice from him!”August is not a time for sweeping conclusions. We do not even know what some teams will look like by the time the transfer window shuts next week. Napoli themselves are in the market for another forward. Several managers expressed frustration over the weekend at starting the season knowing their squads are not yet settled.Still, there are better and worse ways to begin. If De Bruyne got off to a perfect start, the same could not be said of Luka Modric at Milan. Expectations were always more modest for a player who will celebrate his 40th birthday next month, but the former Ballon d’Or winner went straight into the starting lineup for theRossoneri’s game at home toCremonese.View image in fullscreenLuka Modric was solid for a disjointed Milan.Photograph: Piero Cruciatti/AFP/Getty ImagesHis own performance was solid. For the 74 minutes he was on the pitch, Modric had the ball more than any other player, doing his best to conduct an orchestra of out-of-tune instruments. Even the sounds from the stands were discordant at San Siro, ultra groups staying silent in a protest over a ticketing dispute and allowing Cremonese’s visiting support to be loudest.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Their newly promoted opponents soaked up pressure and struck decisively on the counter. Not content with dominating Santiago Giménez in defence, the Cremonese centre-back Federico Baschirotto showed up at the other end to head in an opening goal in the 28th minute.Something of a cult figure in Italian football, famous for his bodybuilder physique and Arnold Schwarzenegger-inspired celebrations, Baschirotto stopped to pose as he jogged back up the pitch. He is fast acquiring a different reputation, as the man who helps smaller clubs to reach heights unknown.View image in fullscreenFederico Baschirotto (left) scores Cremonese’s first goal in the 2-1 win over Milan.Photograph: Image Photo Agency/Getty ImagesBaschirotto joined this summer from Lecce, whom he helped to stave off relegation for three consecutive seasons – securing their longest stay in the top flight. Now he would lift Cremonese – the club from whose academy he graduated a little more than a decade ago – toward their first ever opening-round win. In all their previous eight Serie A campaigns, dating back 96 years, they had always begun with a defeat.More astonishing than an eventual 2-1 scoreline was the swagger. After Milan equalised through Strahinja Pavlovic, Cremonese responded with an outrageous winner. Baschirotto, inexplicably attacking the hosts’ penalty area yet again, served a backheel pass to Giuseppe Pezzella, who crossed for Federico Bonazzoli to score with a magnificent scissor-kick.“The first match is always complicated,” said Massimiliano Allegri afterward. This is not the homecoming he had hoped for on his return to managing theRossoneri, 14 years after he led them to a Serie A title.A contradicting verdict came from Bonazzoli. “As an Inter fan, a goal against Milan counts double,” he quipped. The greatest joys in football are often the simplest.PosTeamPGDPts1Como1232Juventus1233Napoli1234Cremonese1135Roma1136Atalanta1017Cagliari1018Fiorentina1019Pisa10110Genoa10111Lecce10112Inter Milan00013Torino00014Udinese00015Verona00016AC Milan1-1017Bologna1-1018Lazio1-2019Parma1-2020Sassuolo1-20Explore more on these topicsSerie ASportblogEuropean club footballNapoliSassuoloMilanCremonesefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Nobody in Germany remembers, and an era when Bayern Munich’s centre-forward seemed even vaguely stoppable seems like a very long time ago. The optics of his imperious second-half hat-trick in this opening game were very welcome, particularly in the light of the Bundesliga’s groundbreaking new TV deal which meant viewers in the England captain’s home country could see Kane do his thing on the BBC or on a choice of two different YouTube platforms.Yet the remarkable thing about Bayern’s first-night salvo is that they still would have destroyedRB Leipzig, one of their more challenging domestic hurdles of recent years, had Kane not showed up to the party. It was the dictionary definition of ruthlessness but Ole Werner, the new Leipzig coach, could have done nothing in his half-time team talk to change the course of events. By the interval, Michael Olise’s double and a brilliant Luis Díaz debut strike in between already had Bayern home and hosed. Kane’s contribution was merely extra cream and cherry if you were Bayern, or salt if you were Leipzig.McTominay and De Bruyne gel for new-look Napoli but Milan let down Modric  | Nicky BandiniRead moreTechnically the visitors might have had cause for complaint, with Antonio Nusa’s thunderous second-half strike disallowed; rightly, because Castello Lukeba had taken several touches rather than passing from a free-kick award directly before but wrongly, because the officials were only alerted by Joshua Kimmich’s “unusually strong protests” (per a DFB statement), making it an instance of VAR working outside its agreed remits.With that said, Leipzig would look ridiculous if they were to protest. And who would want a replay of this nightmare? Werner is marshallinga significant rebuildand in that sense the timing of this trip to Munich was cruel, like taking an exam having had 10 minutes to revise. It would be unfair to judge the new coach or his team on this but rivalling Bayern will not be their job this season. Their job, and Werner’s, is to forget this and move on. Bayern were simply magnificent, even without Jamal Musiala to call on. Olise was scintillating, untouchable, and Vincent Kompany made a point of praising Serge Gnabry, frequently linked with a move away but renewed here as Musiala’s locum. “When we went into the locker room at half-time,” added Kimmich, “I already told him that he was playing exceptionally well.”The rest of the opening weekend gave no indication that anyone – at least for now – could do what Werner’s side failed to do and at least make Bayern uncomfortable.Bayer Leverkusenwere, perhaps, the weekend’s biggest losers for Erik ten Hag’s first Bundesliga game at the helm after a surprise 2-1 defeat at home by unfancied Hoffenheim. “A game in which not everything was bad, but definitely not much was good either,” in the words of their newly arrived goalkeeper Mark Flekken.Leverkusen took an early lead through Jarell Quansah but they never looked comfortable, and the visitors equalised when Quansah deflected Fisnik Asllani’s shot past Flekken and into his own net. Tim Lemperle hit the second-half winner, having hit a post inside two minutes, and Ten Hag’s team rarely looked like creating anything outside of set pieces – Quansah’s opener had been headed in from an Álex Grimaldo free-kick.View image in fullscreenFisnik Asllani (left) battles with Edmond Tapsoba during Hoffenheim’s win over Bayer Leverkusen.Photograph: Rene Nijhuis/MB Media/Getty ImagesIf the starting lineup didn’t look too unfamiliar, with Flekken and Quansah two of only three new signings starting, the drop-off in quality is clear, with only Patrik Schick, Edmond Tapsoba and Piero Hincapié (with the latter coveted by Arsenal) regular starters in the back half of last season.Die Werkself’s famous punch from the bench is no more either, with new boy Ernest Poku the only non-teenager of the outfield substitutes. Ten Hag needs a productive last week of the transfer window.The window has been frustrating for Borussia Dortmund too, but not as frustrating as their Saturday opener at St Pauli. BVB, following on from their sensational run-in to snatch aChampions League place last season, were striding towards a win as they led 3-1 with five minutes of normal time to go, despite Serhou Guirassy missing a penalty after his headed opener. Then defensive debutant Filippo Mané was shown a red card for holding back Abdoulie Ceesay as he prepared to shoot and Danel Sinani scored the resulting penalty before Eric Smith scored his now-customary piledriver against Dortmund to tie it up. “This shouldn’t happen to a top team,” chided Niko Kovac, and he wasn’t the only unhappy one.On Jobe Bellingham’sBundesligadebut he was substituted at half-time, with his parents, Mark and Denise, coming through to talk to Sebastian Kehl after full time. Bild reported that Bellingham’s father gave the sporting director his views on the switch and Dortmund’s performance. It was clear Kehl had been blindsided. “We are all disappointed with the result,” he said, “but the [changing rooms and area around them] is and remains reserved for players, coaches and management, not families and advisers. That won’t happen again. We have clearly informed everyone involved of this.” Jobe’s arrival is a test for Dortmund. Can they still develop elite talent having wandered from that as their modus operandi? The tension around the club – with goalscorer Julian Brandt talking about taking bad habits of recent times “with us into the new season” – means a strong lead from Kovac and Kehl is important to get this season on the right road.Quick GuideBundesliga resultsShowBayern Munich 6-0 RB Leipzig, Bayer Leverkusen 1-2 Hoffenheim, Eintracht Frankfurt 4-1 Werder Bremen, Freiburg 1-3 Augsburg, Heidenheim 1-3 Wolfsburg, Union Berlin 2-1 Stuttgart, St Pauli 3-3 Borussia Dortmund, Mainz 0-1 Köln, Borussia Mönchengladbach 0-0 HamburgWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Not everything is perfect at Bayern; after Kane’s post-Super Cupcomments that the squad “is a bit light”Max Eberl is expected to go back to the board today and ask for further funds, with another forward a priority.

Making light of Hugo Ekitiké’s exit, they hammered Werder Bremen 4-1 with 19-year-old Can Uzun (a sensational opening goal and two assists) and 20-year-old Jean-Mattéo Bahoya (two goals) leading the way. No prizes for spotting their next €80m-plus sales.The return of Hamburg after seven years away (in the season HSV went down Schalke were runners-up in the Bundesliga and Pep Guardiola won hisfirst Premier League titlewith Manchester City, to give you some idea of how much has happened since) was encouraging as they took a goalless draw at Borussia Mönchengladbach. “It can only get better,” grumped the Gladbach captain, Rocco Reitz.In fact both promoted teams – in what is the rarest of occurrences in the modern European game – kept a clean sheet on opening day, with Köln taking all three points via Marius Bülter’s late headed winner at last season’s surprise team Mainz. The real head-turner, though, wasEffzeh’s new coach, Lukas Kwasniok, who wore the team’s home shirt on the touchline. “I saw the jersey presentation at a sponsors’ evening and got goose bumps,” he said. “Then the decision was clear to me. I’d do it, if I was allowed to” (note; he was, as Köln were wearing their black and gold away strip, with Kwasniok expected to switch to that to avoid a clash when they play at home against Freiburg next week).View image in fullscreenLukas Kwasniok: Köln’s full-kit manager.Photograph: Heiko Becker/ReutersPosTeamPGDPts1Bayern Munich1632Eintracht Frankfurt1333Augsburg1234Wolfsburg1235Hoffenheim1136Union Berlin1137Cologne1138Borussia Dortmund1019St Pauli10110Borussia M'gladbach10111Hamburg10112Stuttgart1-1013Bayer Leverkusen1-1014Mainz1-1015Freiburg1-2016Heidenheim1-2017Werder Bremen1-3018RB Leipzig1-60Explore more on these topicsBundesligaEuropean club footballBayern MunichRB LeipzigBayer Leverkusen1899 HoffenheimBorussia DortmundfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It is thought the Merseyside club will pay an initial £35m for the forward, who has signed a four-year contract, and Saints have inserted a 20% sell-on fee.Dibling impressed in the Premier League last season despite Southampton enduring a dismal campaign that ended in relegation. The England Under-21 winger joinedChelseain the summer of 2022 but returned to Southampton a month later after struggling to settle. “I think I’ve come to Everton at the perfect time and hopefully I can be here for many years,” Dibling said.‘World-class talent’: how Tyler Dibling rose to be a shining light in Saints’ gloomRead moreThe 19-year-old forwardconsiders Jack Grealish, another of David Moyes’s eight summer recruits, one of his inspirations. “I think the manager is perfect for me,” Dibling said. “He’s helped so many players before who were in my position. I’ve spoken to him and I know he’s going to be good for me. There are so many players here to learn from, real quality players like Jack Grealish and Iliman Ndiaye.”Dibling was tracked by several clubsincluding RB Leipzig, Tottenham and Aston Villa, after his breakthrough at Southampton, for whom he made his debut aged 17. He represented Saints’ under-21s at the age of 15 and sparked widespread attention after scoring a near-identical hat-trick against Newcastle at St James’ Park.Bournemouthare close to signing Axel Disasi fromChelsea. The 27-year-old is expected to join on loan and become the third defender brought in after the club made almost £145m from the sale of two centre-halves and a left-back.Disasi’s starts at Chelsea last season came largely in the Conference League and League Cup before he joined Aston Villa on loan in the winter window. He is able to play at centre-back or right-back and has made 44 Premier League appearances since joining Chelsea from Monaco two years ago.View image in fullscreenAxel Disasi (centre) scored for Chelsea against Noah in last season’s Conference League before joining Aston Villa on loan.Photograph: Matthew Childs/Action Images/ReutersBournemouth have sold Illia Zabarnyi,Dean HuijsenandMilos Kerkezto Paris Saint-Germain, Real Madrid and Liverpool respectively this summer, and brought in Bafodé Diakité andAdrien Truffert as replacements.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It’s about adapting to who you’re playing against and helping each other, move for each other, and then it’s not really about the system. It’s more like how you’re dealing with it.”Dorgu, speaking before Sunday’sdraw at Fulham, expanded on the formation’s fluidity. “It’s up to you how you want to play,” he said. “If the midfielders feel like they’re getting man-marked, then they can move down, get the ball, and play. You need to move. Obviously, you’re not just going to move around [anywhere]. I can’t just run to the right side, but you can move in your position.”The United hierarchy’s target is a return to European competition after a campaign in which the club finished 15th andlost in the final of the Europa League. Dorgu,who joined from Leccefor €30m in February, is bullish about their prospects, however. “We are aiming to win the Premier League,” said the 20-year-old Denmark international. “We are Manchester United, so that’s always going to be our goal – 100%. We just need to take it game by game.”United has signed Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha this summer and Dorgu is intent on forming a partnership along the left flank with Cunha. “I feel like he’s really good at driving with the ball, getting past players, and with my runs and what I can do, this will help him to do that,” said Dorgu. “Cunha talks a lot and he’s really funny, he tries to engage with everyone so it’s easier to talk with him because he has a lot of energy.”Explore more on these topicsManchester UnitedRuben AmorimnewsShareReuse this content"

Photograph: Aston Villa FC/Getty ImagesMix of youth and experience bolsters hopes that Villa can build on encouraging start made under Natalia ArroyoBySophie DowneyMon 25 Aug 2025 19.01 EDTLast modified on Mon 25 Aug 2025 19.09 EDTShareGuardian writers’ predicted position:6th (NB: this is not necessarily Sophie Downey’s prediction but the average of our writers’ tips)Last season’s position:6thProspectsAston Villa will be aiming for a smoother Women’s Super League season, having spent much of the 2024-25 campaign flirting with relegation. There were strong signs, however, that the club had put the problems of Robert de Pauw’s tenure behind them with a comfortable sixth-place finish. An eye-catching final run saw them unbeaten in five games, scoring 16 in the process, including five against Arsenal.The four months under De Pauw had proved an unmitigated disaster and left Natalia Arroyo with a mountain to climb when she joined the club in January. Once safety had been secured, the Spaniard’s coaching principles started to shine and the team visibly grew in confidence. But with an ageing squad, there was always going to be some turnover and the departures of Jordan Nobbs, Danielle Turner and Rachel Corsie point to this fact. It was important for Arroyo to maintain a strong spine and Rachel Daly’s contract extension points to how valued her leadership and experience remains, while managing to keep Anna Patten, Kirsty Hanson and Lucy Parker indicates that Villa remains attractive for high-quality internationals.Arroyo has injected youth into her squad over the summer with the signings of Ellie Roebuck (25), Lynn Wilms (24), Océane Deslandes (25) and England Under-23 international Lucia Kendall, while bringing in Jill Baijings permanently from Bayern Munich was a notable coup. The Netherlands midfielder made a significant impact on loan last season, wearing the captain’s armband in the absence of Daly on several occasions.Villa have been building momentum in pre-season. A 2-0 defeat at Manchester United was followed by a 5-1 win over Liverpool and an impressive 1-1 draw away to Paris Saint-Germain. With a final friendy to come against Union Berlin, Arroyo’s side are looking to be in strong shape for theiropening match away at Brighton.Aston Villa’s league placing since 2021.Aston Villa’s league placing since 2021The managerView image in fullscreenNatalia Arroyo was a surprise appointment but has quickly put her stamp on Aston Villa.Photograph: Neville Williams/Aston Villa FC/Getty ImagesArroyo was probably not on many people’s radars when she signed a three-and-a-half year deal in January, but the 39-year-old has already proved to be one of Europe’s most promising coaches. After being forced to retire from playing through injury, Arroyo began her management career with Catalonia before joining Real Sociedad in 2020. Her four-year tenure at the club saw them finish runners-up in Liga F in the 2021-22 season. Arroyo likes her teams to be aggressive in the press and direct going forward, using the pace and energy of the likes of Hanson, Chasity Grant and Ebony Salmon to break defensive lines.Off-field pictureAston Villa became the latest club tooffload their women’s teamto help them avoid any breaches of the Premier League’s profitability and sustainability regulations. The deal saw a 90% stake in the women’s side sold to Villa’s parent company V Sports, which was founded by owners Wes Edens and Nassef Sawiris. A 10% stake was sold to external American investors. It follows Chelsea’s decision to do similar last year when the women’s arm of the club was sold to BlueCo for around £200m.Star signingLynn Wilms became the club’s first marquee signing of the summer, arriving after four seasons at Wolfsburg. The versatile Netherlands international can play at centre-back and right-back and brings plenty of Champions League experience. During her time in Germany, the 24-year-old made more than 100 appearances in all competitions for Wolfsburg, lifting the Frauen-Bundesliga title in 2021-2022 and picking up a Champions League runners-up medal in 2023. Wilms made her debut for the Netherlands at 18 and has featured in four major tournaments, including Euro 2025.Stepping upRachel Maltby is one of the most promising young players to have emerged from Aston Villa’s academy in recent years, and it has been an exciting 12 months for the 18-year-old defender. After finishing fourth with England at the under-17 World Cup last year, she signed her first professional deal with the club in March. Maltby proceeded to make her WSL debut at Villa Park in their 5-2 victory over Arsenal, coming on as a second-half substitute for Maz Pacheco. A dynamic player, she can play at full-back and wing-back on either side of the pitch and possesses plenty of attacking qualities.It was a good summer for …View image in fullscreenNoelle Maritz helped Switzerland reach the quarter-finals of Euro 2025 before being knocked out by Spain.Photograph: Image Photo Agency/Getty ImagesNoelle Maritz was an integral part of Switzerland’s historic run at this summer’s European Championship.

We have given two really good performances [without Isak or a senior striker] and ended up with one point. Alex’s quality would have made a difference in the two games.“I’ve very mixed feelings tonight. It was a great performance from us. I’m gutted for the players. Everyone had told me Anthony’s card was a clear red but I think he was slightly unlucky. There was no intent to damage [Virgil] van Dijk but he’s probably gone in too quickly. Will Osula came on, scored a goal and did well, but we are running out of attacking options.”Not that Howe was entirely downcast. “These players make me proud,” he said. “They are entwined into Newcastle, they want to be here and want to play. They are connected to the club in a way that is really deep. That was an incredible place to play football. As a football club I thought we showcased our talents. This isn’t going to be a simple season for us.

There was not a single penny of actual funding attached to it. We are backing sport because we know how much it matters. It changes people’s lives.”Despite no commitment from Labour for further funding, theECBplans to continue pushing for additional money next year to coincide with England’s staging of the Women’s T20 World Cup, the final of which will be held at Lord’s for the first time. The ECB chair, Richard Thompson, welcomed the initial investment and expressed hope that more would follow to ensure a legacy of more widespread and diverse participation follows the World Cup.“We are pleased to secure government support for these incredible community facilities, which we hope will provide a vital proof point of what can be achieved, and look forward to future collaboration,” Thompson said.“As we look ahead to hosting the ICC Women’s T20 World Cup in 2026, building on that success by rolling out more domes in communities across England and Wales will be key to creating a genuine and lasting legacy from the tournament.“These state-of-the-art all-weather cricket domes will be transformative for the communities they serve, opening up cricket to more people year-round and providing top-class facilities for elite players too. They are an important part of our plans to break down barriers and make cricket the most inclusive team sport.”The ECB’s target is to get an extra 900,000 young people playing cricket by 2029, with the domes an integral part of its Plan for Change as they are to be built in urban areas targeting children who do not play cricket at school, many from diverse and underprivileged backgrounds. The domes have been designed by the ECB in collaboration with Total-play, a cricket facility specialist.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

If more funding is secured the ECB would seek to build domes in cities staging games at the World Cup next year – Manchester, Leeds, Birmingham, Southampton, Bristol and London.“The greatest example of social cohesion is when you see white working-class lads playing with Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs, Indians, Pakistanis, Bangladeshis, it cuts through the divides in an extraordinary way,” Thompson said. “This isn’t so much about sport. This is about society and where sport can solve some of society’s ills.”The announcement on Monday is part of the government’s wider National Youth Strategy, which will be published this autumn.Explore more on these topicsCricketECBLisa NandySport politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

However, he also struggled physically as the match extended in the warm conditions and he threw up during the third set.US Open: Home hopes hit as Madison Keys makes 89 unforced errors in first-round lossRead moreAfterwards, Draper said his ­sickness was not linked to any physical struggles. “I felt physically fine. Potentially a bit of nervous energy. I wasn’t feeling nervous out there. Sometimes I’ve always had some problems with my gut almost. So could be a little bit of just getting out there again, a bit of nervous tension.”Having been forced to withdraw from a series of tournaments after his painfulsecond-round defeat at ­Wimbledonwith bone bruising on his left arm, Draper described his recovery as a work in progress.“I’ve definitely had to rein in my serve a little bit to make sure to keep the pain down, that’s for sure,” said Draper. “At the same time, though, I feel like my accuracy is almost a bit better at times. It’s definitely something which is not giving me pain like on my serve and that’s not why I’m doing it, but it’s one of those things where I’m having to ... put it this way, the ramp-up is quite quick to be here, so I couldn’t go full out on the serve the last few weeks. I’ve got used to maybe toning it down a little bit. I’m not serving full out, pretty much.”As he established a 6-4, 7-5 lead, Draper appeared to be moving towards a comfortable opening win, but he fell down an early break in the third set and vomited on two ­occasions. Draper fought hard to force a tie-break and pulled himself to match point at 6-5 with the Argentinian serving. With the match on the line, the moment inspired Gómez’s best level as his booming forehands found lines all over the court. After saving Draper’s match point with a 99mph forehand winner, he spectacularly forced a fourth set.By the beginning of that set Draper’s serve speeds had drastically reduced, his first serve often barely clearing 105mph, and he was tentative with his forehand, potentially a reflection of his caution with his left arm. But his fighting spirit is eternal regardless of how he feels on the court. After three difficult hours in Louis Armstrong Stadium, the British No 1 emerged with his first victory since Wimbledon.View image in fullscreenFederico Agustín Gómez fought his way back into the match in the third set.Photograph: John G Mabanglo/EPAMany tougher challenges await as he tries to find his top level again in New York. For now, the most important thing is that he gave himself a chance to grow into the tournament by ending his afternoon with a win. “I’m not putting too much expectations on myself,” Draper said. “I’ve put in the work. I know if I can get that level back, I’m going to be tough to beat.”Those low expectations have been dictated by his difficulties over the past few weeks and the fact that he was not always sure he would even be able to compete in New York. Draper had been projected to return to ­competition after eight weeks, but he has managed to return one week early in time for the US Open.“I think as I’ve gotten closer to the tournament, me and my team, we’ve had more scans, we’re confident that I’m not doing any more damage to my arm, and I’m in a place where I can go out and compete. It’s not going to set me back, so that’s a real positive.

Despite repeated warnings of a growing number of predators taking advantage of it, Tor’s developers have taken no action to curb the spread of this content, critics say.The Tor (“the onion router”) network is an anonymity-focused internet system that routes traffic through a global web of volunteer-run servers to obscure users’ identities and locations. By encrypting data in multiple layers – like that of an onion – Tor makes digital activity difficult to trace.This privacy architecture, experts warn, has created a safe haven for child predators. The platform’s design makes it virtually impossible to remove harmful posts or illegal content, they say, and the organization behind Tor has resisted pressure to implement even basic safeguards.The Canadian Centre for Child Protection (C3P) told the Guardian it had submitted more than 19,000 notifications to the Tor Project – the privacy-focused US non-profit that develops and maintains the network – flagging child sexual abuse material (CSAM) detected on its system. Yet the organization has taken no action, according to C3P.“Tor is designed in a way such that they can’t remove anything and they refuse to change it, because the idea of any sort of censorship on there is bad,” said Lloyd Richardson, C3P’s director of technology. “Tor has a board of directors that makes decisions surrounding this, and I don’t think they’ve ever been held to account for any of this. They’re the only people who can essentially intervene, and they refuse to do so.”The Tor Project offers two primary tools designed to enhance online anonymity. The first is the Tor browser, which routes internet traffic on the regular web through a network of volunteer-run servers, effectively masking a user’s location and activity. This process functions similarly to a virtual private network by concealing identifying information.The second, the onion services (formerly known as hidden services), are websites or services hosted within the Tor network, accessible only via .onion addresses. These provide both user and server anonymity. Onion services websites operate exclusively within the Tor network. Their specialized .onion domain allows them to remain concealed from traditional search engines and standard internet access. Neither of Tor’s products has systems to detect, moderate or report CSAM, or mechanisms for processing user-generated content in the way mainstream social networks do.To connect to a hidden service, both the user and the service create separate encrypted paths that meet at a randomly selected rendezvous point. This process involves at least three relays or “nodes” operated by anonymous volunteer entities and individuals around the world, keeping both IP addresses hidden from each other, and makes it exceptionally difficult to trace the user’s activity or location.More users find their way to the dark webWhile using Tor onion services requires more technical expertise than the regular web, recent advancements in its usability are driving an increase in the number of predators active there by lowering the barrier of entry, said experts interviewed.Mainstream social media platforms like Reddit, Telegram and Discord have become informal entry points to the dark web, playing a central role in guiding users on to the Tor network. These platforms host discussions about accessing Tor, which include step-by-step guides, marketplace directories, safety tips and .onion links to illicit content.Now, individuals are often introduced to Tor through social media chats that promise more extreme or explicit content, lowering the barrier to entry for child predators and other offenders, said a federal prosecutor, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.“I’ve had cases where people have started on traditional social media platforms and someone will say to them something along the lines of: ‘If you want to see my real stuff, here’s a link to my thing,’” said the prosecutor. “That is often how that happens and how you get people getting on the dark web or accessing things that they don’t traditionally have access to or wouldn’t access without prompting.”Child predators are drawn to using Tor because they do not need to conceal their activities, already being afforded anonymity by the browser, said Dan Sexton, chief technology officer at the Internet Watch Foundation, a UK-based non-profit that focuses on preventing online child abuse.View image in fullscreenDan Sexton, chief technology officer at the Internet Watch Foundation.Photograph: Graeme Robertson/The Guardian“They know that there are law enforcement and other people monitoring these sites,” said Sexton. “Yet they just do it in plain sight because the anonymity gives them that level of protection, and that feeling like they can’t be found, they can’t be caught, so it’s low risk in that respect.”The predators active in these forums form welcoming communities on Tor’s network, where they compliment and encourage one another in a way that they don’t do elsewhere online, experts say.The Guardian has reviewed excerpts of discussion threads in which users share tips on how to target, groom and abuse very young children. These dark web forums, accessed via Tor, are estimated to have hundreds of thousands of users by C3P. These excerpts were uncovered this year by investigators at the C3P and shared with law enforcement. The material was redacted to remove any information that could identify a victim before it was passed to the Guardian.According to experts, these anonymous communities normalise child abuse, making it more likely that participants will go on to commit contact offenses against children they can access in real life.“People will say ‘this particular victim is what has made me want to violate my own daughter’ and things like that,” said Richardson of C3P. “There’s definitely, by their own admission, this sort of escalation, and they egg each other on in these communities.”A study published byNaturelast year determined that CSAM is easily available using 21 out of the 26 most-used Tor search engines, and that at least 11% of users’ searches seek CSAM. Research published in the Journal of Online Trust and Safety indicatesthat more than 40%of dark web users accessing CSAM go on to seek contact with children with the aim of pursuing sexual acts.A spokesperson for the Tor Project said in a statement it was “deeply troubled by the fact that a small fraction of internet users exploit Tor for illicit purposes, and we strongly condemn the misuse of Tor technology for any illicit use cases, especially child sexual abuse material (CSAM). As an organization dedicated to advancing human rights and strengthening online privacy protections, we recognize the legitimate concerns raised by child protection organizations and experts.”The Tor Project receives funding from a number of backers including the US Department of State, the Swedish government’s international development agency (Sida), the Open Society Foundations, Craig Newmark Philanthropies, theFord Foundationand Twitter founder Jack Dorsey’s philanthropic initiative #StartSmall.Tor’s services have long served as an important tool for protecting online anonymity, enabling free expression and access to information under repressive regimes. Amnesty International has recognized Tor’s contribution to advancing human rights by shielding users from unlawful surveillance and censorship. The ACLU has similarly advocated for its use, urging government websites to inform users of anonymous browsing options, particularly for reporting sensitive information.Tor’s anonymity protections have been crucial for whistleblowers and dissidents. Edward Snowden used Tails, an operating system that routes traffic through Tor, to leak NSA documents anonymously in 2013. During Iran’s 2009 protests, activists relied on Tor to bypass state censorship and coordinate securely with the outside world. The Guardian has also made aversion of its websiteavailable to Tor users as an onion service.However, critics argue that Tor’s benefits should not come at the cost of enabling the distribution of CSAM.“Trading content of children being sexually abused is not protected free expression. It’s a felony,” said Gretchen Peters, founder and executive director of the Alliance to Counter Crime Online (ACCO), a non-profit focused on combating serious online crimes. “Why are US government organizations like the state department continuing to fund the Tor Project, while this problem continues to be so severe?”The US state department did not respond to comment requests.A spokesperson for the Tor Project told the Guardian that introducing mechanisms to monitor or block content on Tor would undermine privacy and security protections that millions of legitimate users rely upon.“Tor is not creating the bad sites – it’s creating the unregulated superhighway that people traverse. It’s willful blindness,” said the prosecutor interviewed. “Child sexual abuse material makes up a significant portion of content hosted on dark web sites.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionThe Tor Project is not legally obligated to report CSAM to authorities, unlike US-based electronic service providers (ESPs) such as social media companies, which must report any detected or apparent CSAM to the National Center for Missing & ExploitedChildren(NCMEC), which evaluates the reports and forwards them to law enforcement. Tor is not considered an ESP since it is engineered for privacy and anonymity, routing internet traffic to conceal user identities rather than hosting or moderating content.These sites operate entirely within the network using .onion addresses.Yet, well-intentioned volunteer node operators may unknowingly contribute to the transmission of harmful content, including the circulation of CSAM and the operation of pedophile networks, experts said.“People who join the Tor network have no opportunity to opt out of the CSAM trade. You support all of Tor when you become a relay or none of it,” said Brian Levine, associate dean of IT and facilities and distinguished professor at University of Massachusetts Amherst.Tor is also not impenetrable to other forms of hacking: the FBI has deployed malware to infiltrate child abuse images sites hosted by Tor, which has uncovered thousands of real IP addresses of users visiting the sites.Millions of pedophilesLaw enforcement agencies around the world have undertaken several high-profile takedowns of large pedophile forums that have revealed the potential scale and organization of these networks.Kidflix, one of the largest-known paedophile sites in the world, was dismantled by international law enforcement earlier this year in an operation involving authorities from more than 35 countries. The platform, which was hosted on Tor, had attracted 1.8 million users globally between April 2022 and March 2025, according to German law enforcement. On 11 March 2025, German and Dutch authorities seized the server, which at the time held approximately 72,000 CSAM videos.Another platform on Tor named Childs Play, boasted a million users when it was in operation between 2016 and 2017, Australian police said after theirsting operationbrought it down.Shutting one site down rarely ends the problem, as predators can easily migrate to another site on the service, experts say. C3P actively monitors and scrapes information from several pedophile sites on Tor, and the larger sites have estimated user bases of between 300,000 and 600,000 each, said Richardson.“It’s created this system where law enforcement takes something down,” said Levine. “It all gets rebuilt back up by a single person who may get caught in the future, but there’s always more of these individuals lining up to start up the next forum that’s carrying the knowledge forward.”The experts interviewed urged Tor to act to remove CSAM from its sites and stem the formation of pedophile groups.“The notion that just because the web addresses aren’t searchable by the surface web doesn’t mean that the administrators of Tor can’t find wrongdoing that is going on in their systems and remove it and report it to authorities,” said Peters, of ACCO.The concern, experts warn, is that while the technique can clearly be applied to illegal material, there is no easy way to draw the line that prevents it from being used more broadly.“Some kind of content moderation is needed. We just haven’t yet figured out how to do it in a way that is scalable,” said Juha Nurmi, cybersecurity expert and postdoctoral research fellow atTampere University in Finland. “It could be done so multiple parties need to use their private keys to make filtering decisions for a certain website, and these are across multiple countries. It could be a way to handle it so we don’t have a central power making decisions.”A spokesperson for the Tor Project said: “The Tor Project collaborates with organizations dedicated to combating the tech-enabled distribution of CSAM by leveraging Tor technology to reach individuals struggling with harmful behaviors and offering them pathways to treatment through private, secure channels.”C3P said its data shows that treatment programs for pedophiles are an ineffective approach to curbing offender behaviour on Tor’s onion services. This is in part because these users aren’t part of the pedophile population seeking help.“Our data indicates that these forums continue to grow in size, and the trade of CSAM made possible by the Tor Project has only increased,” said C3P’s Richardson.In a statement to the Guardian, the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (Sida) said its funding of Tor is earmarked for the training and capacity-building of human rights defenders, abuse survivors, journalists and reporters in need of protection and privacy“Sida is in frequent contact with Tor’s leadership.

On the other hand, he’s very richMon 25 Aug 2025 10.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 25 Aug 2025 14.43 EDTShare“WillDonald Trumpget into heaven?” I know this is a question weighing heavily on your mind right now. The current president of the United States is 79 years old, so we don’t have much time left to sort this one out. Trump clearly has eternity at the top of his agenda, having spoken on at least two occasions aboutwhat happens when we die. He called into a radio program called the Todd Starnes Show, which is a thing people listen to when the internet is out on their block. He waxed on about his military deployment in Washington DC, but also about thepossible systemthat decides the fate of your everlasting soul. “There has to be some kind of a report card up there someplace, y’know, like: ‘Let’s go to heaven, let’s get into heaven.’ It’s sort of a beautiful thing,” he said to Starnes. He’s probably hoping they grade on a curve.On Fox News, Trumpexpressed serious doubthe’s going to get called up to the big leagues of life after death. “I want to try and get to heaven if possible. I’m hearing I’m not doing well. I’m really at the bottom of the totem pole.” I don’t know who he’s hearing this from. Is there a Quinnipiac poll I haven’t read? Has Steve Kornacki weighed in from the MSNBC (sorry, MS Now)big board?Unfortunately, the choice is out of my hands. The afterlife is not exactly a democracy. According to the Catholic church, only God himself can cast a ballot. Even St Peter doesn’t get a say, though I was told that’s because he alwaysforgets to bring his driver’s licenseto the polling place. If things get dicey for the president, he can always sue. The supreme court is open to hearing his arguments.Don’t let Donald Trump undermine your faith in the climate fight | Gina McCarthyRead moreIt’s understandable that the man is publicly pondering the results of his nearly eight decades of acting almost exclusively in his own best interest, as a real estate mogul, reality TV star, WWE Hall of Famer,steak salesman, McDonald’saficionado, andCats enthusiast. The latter should be enough to get him booted downstairs, but again, I don’t get to decide. Bad taste is not disqualifying in the eyes of the Lord, which is why I’m positiveEd HardyandDamien Hirststill have a shot at it.Deep down, even the most hardened atheist probably hopes that heaven exists, that there’s a punter’s chance we can frolic in the clouds wearing resplendent robes and play the harp all day. The alternatives – a fiery nightmare or the yawning void of nothing – aren’t so pleasant.I’m more than a few years the president’s junior, so I hopefully have a bit longer before I get the answer to the ultimate question, but it’s never too early to plan for the future. I also want to get into heaven, but I don’t have a clue how to go about doing it. So I did what any sensible human being would do when faced with a test they didn’t study for.I asked ChatGPT.As soon as I asked, my computer fan went into overdrive. The battery also started emitting a toxic stench that not only repelled my dog, but also caused my neighbors to break down my door to make sure I wasn’t quietly decaying in my living room.After the smell died down, I got back to work. ChatGPT squirted out a brief summary of all the major religions’ stances on heavenly prerequisites. Besides the obvious ones, such as faith in God, the to-dos read suspiciously like a college application. You need to do charity work, study and donate a million dollars to the alumni foundation. Easy stuff.ChatGPT wrapped up with some final “thoughts” on the matter, which didn’t much clarify the practical steps necessary to earn the all-you-can-eat buffet in the sky.“In many traditions, the emphasis isn’t just on ‘getting into heaven,’ but on living a life of compassion, integrity, and faith. While paths differ, a common thread in many religions is the importance of love, kindness, and striving to become the best version of oneself.”I guess I’ll do my best, but I can count at least five times where I didn’t let everyone exit the elevator before I got on or forgot to send a gift to a newlywed couple. I might be screwed. And if I’m screwed, how will Trump fare? In this moment of pessimism for our dear leader, I figured I should follow in his footsteps,ignore evidence I don’t want to hearand find a more sympathetic source.The Billy Graham Evangelistic Association has a helpfularticleentitled “How Can I Know for Sure I’ll Go to Heaven?” Almost immediately, I was comforted. Graham is quoted as saying: “Your salvation depends on what [Christ] has done for you, not on what you do for Him. It isn’t your hold on God that saves you; it’s His hold on you.”California’s governor has become an anti-Trump comedian. It’s 2017 all over again | Dave SchillingRead moreI’ve seen enough. I’m pretty sure I understand all I need to know about saving myself from the cursed lash of the dark lord Lucifer. I don’t have to do anything. Full stop. Instead of thinking about how I behave, how I treat others, or what heavy responsibility I must carry in the corporeal world, I just need to check in to see how many goodies God has sent my way so far. Just like being a child, you know if your parents love you based on how many toys they purchase and how expensive they are. I drive an Audi, so I think I’m probably on the nice list.The article continues: “You can be a loving person, a good person, and even volunteer of the year, but it’ll never be good enough.” Perfect. I don’t even volunteer to help with my son’s homework, I’m riddled with credit card debt and take far too long to clip my toenails. Doesn’t sound like I need to try any harder than “pays the absolute minimum monthly amount” and “trims directly on to the floor of the bathroom, which my girlfriend has repeatedly asked me to not do”.If we’re to use Billy Graham’s words as a guide,Donald Trumpis going to make it upstairs. The only real requirement is that you have to have a personal relationship with God. He has a lot of money, which means God loves him. Eternity, like business, is all about networking. And who’s a better networker than Donald J Trump? Even if Trump doesn’t have God’s personal cellphone number, I’m sure he can ask his friends at the FBI to find it.Dave Schilling is a Los Angeles-based writer and humoristExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionReligioncommentShareReuse this content"

Long has already been fired after clashing with the treasury secretary, Scott Bessent. Long was the sixth person to head the IRS this year.Trump’s presidential philosophy is government by shakedown | Steven GreenhouseRead moreLet’s not forget EJ Antoni, whom Trump just nominated to lead the Bureau of Labor Statistics after firing former chief Erika McEntarfer for presiding over a disappointing jobs report earlier this month.Antoni is that rarity who has drawn harsh criticism from economists on the right as well as the mainstream for being ignorant, unprincipled and incompetent. Herecently celebratedthat “all net job growth over the last year went to native-born Americans”.I haven’t even mentioned the towering ineptitude of Trump’s cabinet picks, such as Pete Hegseth, Pam Bondi, Kash Patel, Robert F Kennedy Jr and Kristi Noem.How to explain the rise of so many incompetent and unprincipled people?Easy. They could never succeed on their own merits. As soon as their incompetence became apparent – which was likely to be as soon as they took the first job that required some degree of intelligence and integrity – they were fired.So they learned that to be rewarded with promotions, money and power, they cannot rely on the normal processes and systems of recognition for jobs well done. If they’re to make anything of themselves, they must instead become ass-lickers, lap dogs and sycophants.They must latch on to someone who values loyalty above integrity or competence, someone for whom fawning obsequiousness is the most important criterion for being hired and promoted, ideally someone who cannot tell the difference between a groveling toady and a knowledgeable adviser.Enter Trump.History is strewn with the wreckage of dictatorships that have attracted and promoted incompetent people lacking talent or integrity. As Hannah Arendt explained in her classic The Origins of Totalitarianism:Totalitarianism in power invariably replaces all first-rate talents, regardless of their sympathies, with those crackpots and fools whose lack of intelligence and creativity is still the best guarantee of their loyalty.Early in his career, Trump apprenticed himself to Roy Cohn, an unprincipled lawyer who taught the young Trump how to gain wealth and influence through ruthless bullying, profane braggadocio, opportunistic bigotry, baseless lawsuits, lying, and more lying.Yet as Trump’s “fixer” with politicians, judges and mob bosses, Cohn remained utterly loyal to Trump and his father, Fred.Years later, in his book The Art of the Deal,Trump drew a distinction between integrity and loyalty. He preferred the latter, and for him, Cohn exemplified it.

Blind ambition trips them up. They cannot explain or defend their behavior by relying on principled competence because, like Cohn, they are unprincipled and incompetent to their cores.The people they latch onto meet similar fates but for a different reason.Leaders who value loyalty above all else find themselves surrounded by sycophantic crackpots and fools. As a result, they receive no objective or useful feedback about their actions – no warnings beforehand and no criticism afterward. All they get are commendations – “Wonderful idea, sir!” “Brilliant execution, sir!”These cocoons of flattery seal off such leaders from the real-world consequences of what they do – which inevitably leads them to make grave mistakes. Some of those mistakes eventually cause their downfalls.This perverse symmetry – the certain demise of grovelers because they’re incompetent and unprincipled and the inevitable downfall of those to whom they grovel because they never get useful and truthful feedback – marks the path of all totalitarian systems. It’s the path on which Trump now treads.This is not necessarily cause for hope. If history is any guide, many innocent people suffer before the incompetent grovelers and the vain objects of their groveling meet their inevitable fates.

But Democrats must not ignore how people feelMon 25 Aug 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 25 Aug 2025 08.37 EDTShareIn most of America’s largest cities, crime, especially violent crime, is down. But the fear of crime is increasing.Donald Trumphas made a career out of ignoring the reality of crime rates and of stoking that fear. Well before he entered politics and throughout his political career, hehas talkedabout city life as life in a proverbial jungle.In 2022, he talked frequently about the “ blood-soaked streets of our once-great cities” and said: “Cities are rotting, and they are indeed cesspools of blood.” And he neverstraysfar from that playbook.On 11 August, the presidentreturned tohis demagogic characterizations of America’s urban areas when he deployed national guard and federal law enforcement agents to the streets of Washington DC. He said the city was awash in “crime, bloodshed, bedlam, and squalor”.Heclaimedthat “crime is out of control in the District of Columbia”. In fact, violent crime in the District of Columbia is the lowest it has been in more than three decades.But Trump didn’t just ignore the data. He leaned into a different problem in Washington: fear of crime.Referring to Washingtonians who like to jog, the presidentsaid: “People tell me they can’t run any more. They’re just afraid.”And he was not content to target just the nation’s capital. “You look at Chicago,”he said, “how bad it is. You look at Los Angeles, how bad it is. We have other cities in a very bad – New York is a problem. And then you have, of course, Baltimore and Oakland. We don’t even mention that any more. They’re so far gone. We’re not going to let it happen.”Never mind that, like Washington, as CNNreports, Chicago, Baltimore and other cities also have had “substantial declines in 2024, 2025 or both”.So far, Democratic political leadershave repeatedthose statistics as if that in itself will carry the day. In so doing, they are repeating a mistake made by Joe Biden when he asked people to focus on economic statistics that showed declines in the rate of inflation rather than their lived reality.Unfortunately, the statistics matter much less than the fear of crime. That fear is a real problem, andDemocratsneed to acknowledge and respond to it.Let’s start with the District of Columbia. A Washington Post-Schar School pollconductedin mid-August found that 31% of Washingtonians said crime was an “‘extremely serious’ or a ‘very serious’” problem in the District. Last year, the same pollfoundthat number to be 65%. Some of this decline can be attributed to the fact that residents of the city overwhelminglyopposewhat the president has done and don’t want to be seen as lending it legitimacy.But however you measure it, fear of crime is not just a District of Columbia problem.In New York City, 75% of residents say that crime is a serious problem. As an essay posted on Vital Cityputs it: “Whatever crime statistics show, most of us are worried that it could happen to us. That feeling is nebulous and hard to overcome … We the people say crime is a serious problem, and most of us will continue, for now, to look over our shoulders and worry when someone we love leaves home.”National surveyssuggestthat “Americans’ fear of crime is at a 30-year high”. Other survey evidencehighlightsthe fact that “73% say crime has ‘some’ or ‘major’ impact on how they live their lives”. Among Black and Hispanic Americans, that number is even higher.Not surprisingly, many Americans now favor long prison sentences for convicted criminals.Explanations vary for the paradox that as crime rates fall, fear of crime persists.Crime stories oftendominatelocal news coverage, and the more gruesome the crime, the greater the coverage. That is why fear of crimeis drivennot by a dispassionate examination of data but by the power of individual stories of victimization.That pattern is intensified by social media. Studies have shown that social media usagestokes crime fear.Demographics also matter. Crime fearsaregreater among older people, and, as the population ages, those fears increase.Fear of crimeis also associated witha generalized sense of disorderliness in our communities and the world. And, as the economist and criminal justice scholar John Roman argues, because “our collective tolerance for disorder is declining”, our fear of crime is increasing.Of course, it doesn’t help that Trump uses the bully pulpit and his public visibility to emphasize and exaggerate the crime problem as part of his authoritarian project. But blaming Trump for the fear of crime problem is not any more of a winning political strategy than reciting the latest data on falling crime rates.Democrats can’t and shouldn’t run away from either the crime problem or the fear of crime problem. They will have no credibility in offering responses to the former until they establish credibility on the latter.They would be well-advised to tackle the fear problem openly and to embrace responses, like investing in programs that repair public spaces and revitalize neighborhoods, while also being clear that people who fear crime have reason to want to see more police on the street.Trump knows the potency of the fear of the crime problem. That’s why heboastedthat after his deployment of national guard in Washington, DC, “People are feeling safe already … They’re not afraid any more.”But we don’t need the national guard to do what local police can do when they are well-trained, responsive to the needs of all communities and well-resourced. The best long-term response to the president’s agenda for American cities is to make sure that the people who live there have more confidence in their safety and less fear of crime.Austin Sarat, William Nelson Cromwell professor of jurisprudence and political science at Amherst College, is the author or editor of more than 100 books, including Gruesome Spectacles: Botched Executions and America’s Death PenaltyExplore more on these topicsWashington DCOpinionDonald TrumpDemocratsUS politicsUS crimecommentShareReuse this content"

It has allowed me to build bridges across cultures, to connect with people from vastly different walks of life and to find a sense of belonging wherever I’ve been: Australia, Germany, Pakistan or Afghanistan. Each language I’ve learned has brought with it a new lens through which to view the world. But nothing has stirred my soul quite like Persian – the language of mystics and lovers.My journey into the Persian language felt less like consciously acquiring a new skill and more like unlocking a secret passage inside myself. It has opened doors not just to new ideas and ways of thinking but to the deepest emotions. For the first time, I’ve found a language that doesn’t just help me navigate time and space in mere practical terms but helps me to express and feel every moment beyond that.Amid the chaos after the fall of Kabul, two men became my lifeline | Shadi Khan SaifRead moreMy journey with Persian began a couple of years ago, with some naive assumptions and fake smiles when Persian-speaking Afghans cracked jokes. I was new in Kabul, following years of wandering in neighbouring Pakistan and then later in Europe. I had no idea about this second national language of the country – mine was Pashtu. I have been fascinated with the Persian language since learning it in an entirely natural way – just by talking to friends, through music, movies and poetry. It is the cultural elegance so woven into the language and its abundance of rich emotional expressions that make it unique.For instance, consider “Nosh-e jaan” (May it nourish you) said to someone eating food, or “Gul Gufti” (Your words are beautiful like roses). There’s also “Del-at shad bashad” (May your heart be joyful)or“Khak-e paye tu-am”(I am the dust beneath your feet), used to show respect to and love of elders or teachers. These may sound bizarrely formal, but they are everyday staples in Persian.From its greetings to the haunting depth of its classical verse, Persian is rich with rhythm, subtlety and emotional nuance. It is a language that carries music in its tone and wisdom from the music of Bollywood to the mountains of Afghanistan to the valleys of Iran, orchids of central Asia and as far as the gates of Europe in Turkey. Even the most ordinary phrases seem to hum with history and feeling. It’s as if every word carries a centuries-old heartbeat.In Persian I’ve discovered expressions for emotions I had long felt but could never articulate. I’ve found metaphors that mirror my own journey, phrases that feel like home and poetry that speaks directly to the soul. It’s more than a means of communication – it’s a new way of being, of loving, of remembering and of dreaming.My romance with Persian began when Afghanistan’s Pashtu speakers were pushing to reclaim status and space for their language in a country with a deep-rooted Afghan dialect, Dari, which has long been used in almost all official communications. For me, the politics of it hardly mattered. I had learned Pashtu at home from my sweet mum and loved it as my inner core language, before learning my second language, Urdu/Hindi, then English and Punjabi during my years in Pakistan’s biggest and most diverse metropolis, Karachi. I learned German when I went to work at that country’s public broadcaster Deutsche Welle in Bonn. English, perhaps the most professionally transformative of the languages I speak, is the language I write in, but it remains a bit foreign and a bit distant. Like a guest who had overstayed but never fully moved in.Persian was not a language I learned; it was one that absorbed me. Unlike the others, Persian didn’t just expand my vocabulary – it rewired my emotions. It cracked open an interior world I hadn’t known how to access. It wasn’t about fluency – it was about awakening.Fragrant smoke on a wintry Melbourne night rekindles friendships and evokes memories of home in far-off Kabul | Shadi Khan SaifRead moreIt is a language that doesn’t shy away from feeling. It doesn’t rush towards meaning or neat endings; it lingers. In Persian even pain is a form of grace. You don’t just say you’re missing someone, you say “Dil-tangetam”“My heart is constricted because of you”. “Safa avordi” (You brought good energy/joy with you),is often said when a guest visits.For me, someone who wasn’t lucky enough to spend hours reading Persian books when I stayed in Kabul, it is delightful to see how convenient it is to access the Persian maestro, Afghanistan-born Jalal al-Din Balkhi or Mawlana or Rumi as he is known around the world. He is like the god of Persian language for me.I remember the moment I first read this line by Rumi in its original form:Asheq sho, gar na ruzi kar-e jahan sar ayad – Nakhande naqsh-e maqsud az kargah-e hasti.Fall in love, or someday the work of the world will end – And you’ll leave this workshop of being without having seen its purpose.Somewhere in this journey of learning Persian, I felt its role in overcoming the noise of modern urgency. There’s a word in Persian –delneshin– that means something that sits sweetly on the heart. That’s what Persian has become for me. A quiet, enduring echo.Shadi Khan Saif is an editor, producer and journalist who has worked in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Germany and AustraliaExplore more on these topicsLanguagesOpinionPoetrycommentShareReuse this content"

On Saturday,thousands of peoplegathered in Habima Square in central Tel Aviv to demand an end to the war – one of the largest rallies since the fighting broke out. Israeli police revoked a prior permit for a march through the city, in a clear attempt to silence our voices of opposition – but we refused to let them succeed. It had been 24 hours since the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC)declared a faminein Gaza and revealed the horrors of Israel’s full-scale starvation campaign. Many Israelis felt it was our duty to rally in the streets.Since the cabinet resolution to reoccupy Gaza City, the Israeli military has issued 60,000 new recruitment warrants for reserve service. When the warrants come into effect in early September, the reserve forces will be at their highest level since the outbreak of the war – 130,000. But the military is not the only thing increasing in size. So, too, is the refusal movement.In recent weeks, a surge of refusers emerged in response to the political cynicism of Benjamin Netanyahu. In private talks between family members or in public declarations of objection, more and more Israelis are realising that participating in military service is to be complicit with the government’s crimes. The movement is not homogenous – either in age and social grouping, or in motive or ideology. Some conscientious objectors, like the teenagers of Mesarvot,go public with their refusalto be part of the war machine. They are treated with extreme severity and often subjected to cycles of imprisonment in military jail. I have personally conducted regulatory visits at such facilities, meeting these brave people who have come to be known as “soldiers of peace”.Others are less willing to publicise their stance, but privately refuse to serve. The data on the exact number of “grey refusers” is treated as a top intelligence secret and is not shared by the military, butYesh Gvul, an organisation that assists those called up to obtain draft exemptions, says their number is constantly increasing. A recent poll published in Haaretz showed a striking increase in public support for those refusing to be drafted – about33% of Jewish Israelisbelieve it is not only justified, but necessary, to save the hostages from the dangers of the military campaign in Gaza City. Motives for refusal range from resisting the genocide, moral objections to participating in war crimes, political opposition to the occupation at large and concern that military action endangers the hostages to disapproval of the ultra-Orthodox community’s exemption from service.Ella Keidar Greenberg, a conscientious objector who spoke at Saturday’s rally after being held in solitary confinement throughout April, said that by refusing she was able to obstruct the continuing destruction. While they are still speaking from a marginal position, it is clear that more and more Israelis wish to frustrate the government. In recent months, more demonstrations, vigils and direct action against Netanyahu’s war have been taking place.United by the basic notion of humanity, thousands of Arabs and Jews joined one another on Saturday to protest against the starvation, slaughter and carnage. Protesters held up pictures of the starved and bombed children ofGaza, knowing that the culprit responsible for their torment is still in power. We urged the release of all hostages and unlawful captives – Israelis and Palestinians alike – in a political agreement that would see the Israeli government pulling all military forces out of Gaza.1:33Israel protests erupt nationwide to demand end of Gaza war – videoBut in the wake of news of another round of bombardments in Gaza, our message from the rally is best understood from the banner: “Never again”. Never again will we allow silence to prevail in the face of slaughtered children and starved families. Never again will we look on quietly as Netanyahu orders the destruction of neighbourhoods and the invasion of hospitals. Never again will we let his government refuse an agreement that will release the hostages. Never again will the Gaza genocide unfold quietly.As the descendant of a Jewish family from Poland, the words “never again” have significant meaning for me. In the aftermath of the second world war, humankind vowed to never again allow such atrocities to occur. The Holocaust, the mass extermination of the Jewish people, plumbed the very depths of tyrannical evil. Precisely because of this heritage, I view “never again” as a universal imperative.In 1948, the international community adopted the universal declaration of human rights and the convention on the prevention and punishment of the crime of genocide. In the decades since, we have failed globally many times to safeguard this invaluable truth: that people must not perish in flames, and such heinous crimes must not be perpetrated while outsiders stand idly by. But never in recent times have people around the world stared into the abyss of annihilation as we are doing today in Gaza. As such, “never again” is not merely a moral reminder but an ethical decree to act.As Netanyahu starves Gaza, there is a whole new battle to be fought in Israel – against complacency | Aluf BennRead moreFool me once, shame on you, fool me twice, shame on me, as the saying goes. It seems that Netanyahu manages to fool western leaders time and time again. On Friday, in response to the IPC declaration of famine, the UK foreign secretary, David Lammy, said it was an “utterly horrifying and wholly preventable man-made catastrophe”. May I ask Lammy and the rest of the British cabinet – are you among the people responsible for this catastrophe? In July, the UK prime minister, Keir Starmer,announced a conditional planto recognise a Palestinian state if Israel did not change course.Starving people who are under constant threat of bombardment do not enjoy the same patience as suited officials in marble offices. They plead for food, water and air while politicians debate conditions and timing.Starmer must immediately recognise Palestine unconditionally, but he must recognise much more than that. He must acknowledge Netanyahu as the international war criminal that he is. He must support new sanctions to tackle the settler movement, including ministers such as Itamar Ben-Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich. He must recognise that Netanyahu and his government are the main obstacle to releasing the hostages. He must recognise the people of Gaza as victims of a continuing genocide, and act accordingly. Or he will remain complicit in this devastating, human-made catastrophe.Dr Ofer Cassif is a member of the Knesset, representing the Democratic Front for Peace and Equality (Hadash) since 2019Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Until I was persuaded to really listen to the lyricsAna SchnablMy teenage self loved the misanthropic look and sound of these bands, but I was horrified when I learned what they representedMon 25 Aug 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 25 Aug 2025 13.19 EDTShareLike many bad teenage ideas, it began with a friend I admired a little too much. He was my best friend – he seemed sure of himself and possessed that type of musical taste that made everything else feel cringe. He moved from genre to genre with a sense of purpose. I, meanwhile, merely followed – diligently, even devoutly. When he discovered black metal, I followed him there too.Soon, my bedroom began to resemble a mausoleum: there were band posters featuring men made up to look like corpses glowering into Nordic fog, and CDs with tracklists that looked more like incantations than music. I began dressing the part – black on black on black. I scoured forums for rare pressings and live bootlegs. And yet, I didn’t really know what I was listening to.The music itself was hypnotic: raw, relentless, thick with atmosphere. It sounded like alienation and angst and misanthropy – which, to a teenager, was more or less the point. It gave form to rebellion. But I didn’t take a look behind the scenes. I just savouredthe vibes.At a certain point, my friend told me that Varg Vikernes, the man behind the Norwegian music project Burzum,had killed his bandmateand served time for murder. “Erm, what are we supposed to do with that?” we wondered.We shrugged and said we’d shun his music and focus on others’ instead. Cool.Then my cousin called. He’s 11 years older than me – hetaught me how to play chesswhen I was a child, picked books for me to read, was generally level-headed. I’d mentioned some of the bands I was into during a visit. He’d done what I hadn’t: looked them up. Translated lyrics. Read interviews. Traced connections. What he found made my stomach turn.A number of these bands, it turned out, weren’t just provocateurs with a flair for the macabre. They trafficked in something darker: coded fascist imagery, explicit Nazi sympathies, antisemitic allusions. Some had links to actual hate groups. Others sang odes to racial purity in archaic languages or quoted far-right ideologues beneath layers of rune fonts. Graveland and Nokturnal Mortum – bands I had once prized for their “atmosphere” – were now impossible to listen to in the same way.Graveland’s founderRob Darkenoften expressed white nationalist views and aligned himself with pagan fascist ideas. At the beginning of their career, Nokturnal Mortum had strong ties to theNational Socialist black metal(NSBM) scene; band members gave interviews endorsing neo-Nazi ideologies. What we’d thought was merely transgressive turned out, in some cases, to be ideologically clear – and its ideology was ethno-nationalism, fascism and white supremacy.My cousin didn’t lecture me. He didn’t make me feel small. He just said: “You’re smart. But don’t let your intelligence make you careless.”That sentence shifted something. Because he was right – I hadn’t been careless by accident. I’d made myself un-curious. I didn’t want to know what the lyrics said and what the bands represented because knowing might have ruined the world I’d built. Back then, I thought I was choosing the music. But in truth, I was choosing to belong to something.After that conversation, I began to step back. And interestingly, so did my friend. The more we read – the more we realised that the fringe aesthetics were, in some cases, a smokescreen for deeply held hatred – the harder it became to hear the music without flinching. The image we’d constructed, of misanthropic musicians howling into cold landscapes, collapsed. What was left was more troubling: a subculture in which some members wore ideology as easily as face paint. The aesthetic wasn’t just surface; it was camouflage.We both stopped listening – not all at once, but steadily. I boxed up the CDs. We unfollowed the forums. Eventually, the friend and I drifted apart, though not because of the music, not directly. Life intervened.And here’s what I still wonder: if my cousin hadn’t said anything, would I have noticed? Would I have cared? Would I have ended up defending ideas I didn’t believe in simply because they came wrapped in sounds I loved?We like to imagine that we are the authors of our convictions – that ideology arrives through argument and reason. But often it slips in sideways, piggybacking on aesthetics, community, taste. When you’re young, especially, belonging can matter more than belief. You pick up codes and allegiances without even noticing. You mouth things before you mean them. And the more you repeat them, the more you become them.What saved me wasn’t my own moral clarity, but a quiet act of attention. Someone I trusted took the time to investigate what I hadn’t, and offered that knowledge without condescension. It didn’t feel like a confrontation. It felt like being gently turned back toward myself.I still listen to loud music. Techno, for instance. But if the music has lyrics, I listen to them. I ask more questions. I know how easy it is to be seduced by the feeling of depth without understanding what lies at the bottom.Ana Schnabl is a Slovenian novelist, editor and criticDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The endorsement of new, unnatural voters –Latinosin the US for Donald Trump, or Tories voting for Labour for thefirst time– might deliver big electoral swings but is ultimately not sticky. And these votes are only meaningful if the bedrock is solid. That bedrock is the people who consistently show up, no matter what, from generation to generation, for a party. And the Democrats are losing them.In extensive research published last week tracking voter registration, the New York Times identified an alarming pattern. The Democratic party has been “haemorrhaging” voters since way before election day. In the states that track voter registration by political party, Democrats lost toRepublicansin all of them in the years between 2020 and 2024. By the time Kamala Harris took over from Joe Biden, the party had already shed more than 2m votes in those states, and Republicans had gained 2.4m. This is part of a “four-year swing” that amounts to 4.5m votes. In a chilling conclusion, the report states that “few measurements reflect the luster of a political party’s brand more clearly than the choice by voters to identify with it”.The signs get worse the more closely you look. It’s not just a decline in new registered voters, but a hacking away of those natural voters who parties can easily rely on. Some of the sharpest declines were among young voters who came out emphatically for Joe Biden in 2020, thenswungtowards Trump in 2024. An assumption that voters who are young, Black or Latino would register mostly in the Democrats’ favour was no longer safe.The most striking thing about these revelations is how long and consistent the turn-off has been: “There is no silver lining or cavalry coming across the hill,” said one voter registration analyst, “this is month after month, year after year.” They show how during the last election, when the Democrats were battling with the damage of a belated handover from Biden to Harris, and a swirl of otherchallenges, the party was already on the back foot, hostage to a years-long disillusionment. And if you look at some of the reasoning for Democrat abandonment from last year, the same conclusion heaves into view – the Democrats rested on their laurels, and Trump attacked. The vibe contest was between business as usual, and the promise of something different.The result is a cratering of Democrat support that cannot be filled in overnight, or even over the next three years, especially with the party seemingly in disarray, and with a lo-fi leadership in Chuck Schumeraccusedof being “unwilling and unable to meet the moment”. It’s not about the unique, mendacious bewitching of voters by Trump, but something broader. Centre-left parties seem trapped by their inability and unwillingness to articulate values in ways that go beyond just saying the other guys are bad for democracy, by identifying a vision of what and who they arefor.They are operating in a world where traditional coalitions around class, labour and identity are dissolving, where high barriers to home ownership, social mobility and job stability have been erected, and the relationship between hard work and prosperity, or even viability, has been severed. Combine that with an online and media ecosystem that trades in attention and feeling, and you have a political climate that requires policy intervention and campaigning edge.LiveZohran Mamdani: who is New York's Democratic mayoral candidate? – video profileInstead, assummedup by Gabriel Winant after Trump’s victory, Kamala Harris had “stretched her coalition into incoherence” in a “grab bag” of policies “sharing no clear thematic unity or coherence”. This is the result of both a lack of direction, and of a party that now houses both the powerful and those at the losing end of that power, which can only mean a lop-sided capture by the former. Or, as chillinglyobservedby Anton Jäger: “Bankers and warmongers predominate in Democrat ruling circles, the indebted and the marginalised among its rank-and-file.” This reminds me of Keir Starmer’s drive tocastLabour as “pro-business, pro-worker and pro-wealth creation”. You cannot have coherence when the interests you represent, or claim to represent, are by definition antagonistic.‘A new political era’: fresh Democratic faces seek office to prevent their party from ‘sleepwalking into dystopia’Read moreThis brand tension has an analogue in a smaller but no less revealing way in the UK, where students areabandoningLabour. University Labour clubs are disaffiliating from the party, Labour’s youth membership has collapsed, the tail of a longer falling out with Labour leadership overGaza. But this is a broader confrontation between young voters and a party that has failed to stand for any clear moral principles that appeal to the idealism so necessary to create not only future voters, but activists and campaigners. On Gaza, Labour isanti-starvation, but alsoanti-protest.And both the Democrats and Labour are positioning themselves antagonistically to those whose sharper expressions of political vision are hugely popular with those who are abandoning them. Senior Democrats might still not endorse New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani, who is postingstunning polling leads. Labour disciplines MPs for rebelling against benefit cuts, even as hundreds of thousands of peopleregister their supportfor a new party.But as new and future voters are lost, the lion’s share of the windfall goes to those on the right and extreme right who have already mastered the gamification of politics, and the ability to summon fever dreams of threats that must be dealt with and prosperity that is just around the corner. “Elections are won from the centre” goes the old adage, but increasingly the centre itself has changed as the world becomes not a place of wide-tent compromise, but of irreconcilable differences. And I would venture another formulation – elections are won in the past. By the time it becomes apparent that remote and complacent centrist politics is not even managing to convince its own tribes, it will be too late. Some would argue it already is.Nesrine Malik is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsDemocratsOpinionRepublicansChuck SchumerDonald TrumpLabourKeir StarmerUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

It is the elegy those of us who grew up in the post-Celtic tiger recession have been cravingMon 25 Aug 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 25 Aug 2025 12.46 EDTShareYou wouldn’t know it to look at the tourist board ads, but the emblem of modernIrelandis probably a shopping centre. And now that emblem has found its bard, in the form of Ciara Mary-Alice Thompson, the Irish pop star and songwriter better known as CMAT. She is a woman wielding a creative energy that is completely her own, but which is also profoundly shaped by her experiences coming of age in a post-Celtic tiger, recession-era Ireland. This has never been clearer than on her new single, Euro-Country, from the forthcoming album of the same name – a project that reminds us that pop culture has the power to illuminate political and social realities that are otherwise being ignored. It is the elegy that we, Ireland’s post-recession generation, needed – and it references at least two shopping centres.The Euro-Country album artwork is a send-up of Jean-Léon Gérôme’s painting Truth Coming Out of Her Well, with CMAT emerging from the fountain in Blanchardstown shopping centre, beside a giant euro coin. In aninterview with the Guardianbefore her spectacularGlastonbury performancein June, Thompson observed that while Ireland is “a little more fetishised and trendy than it’s ever been”, it’s also “a really hard place to live, a really hard place to grow up, unless you have money, which we didn’t. So yeah, magical, beautiful, mystical Ireland: it’s a shopping centre – that’s what I grew up with.”And sure enough, the music video for the single is shot in the Omni retail park in the north Dublin suburbs, with CMAT dancing around the largely empty shopping centre and performing in a vacant shop display window. “Meet me behind the mall,” Taylor Swift once sang, with all of the American mystique that carries, but for Irish people, there is something distinctly soulless about an out-of-town shopping precinct in the post-recession era. It represents the hubris and corruption of the Celtic tiger bubble, and the struggles faced by Irish people in the years since it burst. It’s where everyone drives to get their groceries, of course – but it’s also a microcosm of the economic downturn in the last decade and a half.The YouTube comments on the music video show how much Thompson has struck a chord. Take one example: Euro-Country “isn’t just a song, it’s a reckoning … pulling people all over the world back to the Celtic tiger, forcing that history into the light again. CMAT has managed to give voice to a whole generation’s story.” Thompson dances in front of a branch of the clothing chain New Look, whichwent into liquidationin Ireland in February, and the bakery chain Thunders, whichclosed all its storesin March.The reality is that, post-2008, I do not know anyone in Ireland who has not struggled with money, been through lengthy periods of unemployment, or been forced to move back in with their parents (me included), thanks to catastrophically high rents. The statistics collected by Ireland’sCommunity Action Tenants Union (CATU)are damning: the number of homeless families increased by 232% between 2014 and 2021. Meanwhile, there are anywhere between 92,251 and 183,000 empty homes; while in the north, there are an estimated 20,000 empty homes. The choice for most people of my generation is either to emigrate, or to abandon the hope of ever being able to buy a house.This is the “Euro-Country” CMAT is honouring: modern Ireland, whichshe wroteis “the love of my life, the most toxic boyfriend I’ve ever had, the place which has changed so much that I feel sad every day I can’t return the version of it that is in my head”. The title track is a stirring but melancholic earworm, an elegy for a generation affected by recession and austerity. Hearing it randomly you could be forgiven for missing the scathing politics woven through the song. At least, until Euro-Country’s most devastating line. “I was 12 when the das started killing themselves all around me” is a shocking thing to hear in a pop song, but this is the Ireland that I know, this is the Ireland that many people of my generation know, and this is the Ireland that CMAT sings of. Having lost everything of monetary value in the crash, some also lost their loved ones to suicide; a 2015National Suicide Research Foundation investigationfound that there were 476 more male suicides than expected between 2008 and 2012.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Will that leave neutral Ireland defenceless? | Brigid LaffanRead moreThe economic crash in Ireland was caused by the global financial crisis, but it was also the product of unregulated greed and moneylending on the part of a small group of wealthy politicians, bankers and property developers. They get their own tribute in Euro-Country, with CMAT singing: “All the big boys, all the Berties / All the envelopes, yeah, they hurt me”. The Bertie in question is the former taoiseach and leader of Fianna Fáil Bertie Ahern,who resigned from his partyin the wake of the Mahon tribunal’s 2008 conclusions that money from supporters had been deposited in his bank account. Political solutions to this malaise feel far away, especially as Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael have consistently been returned to government in every general election since the crash. It can be so easy to feel disillusioned and complacent, but I take heart from a key line in the bridge of Euro-Country: “I know it can be better if we hound it”. It makes me think of the rise of organisations such as CATU, branches of whichhave sprung upall over the island of Ireland to advocate for ordinary people’s housing rights: carrying out research on the housing crisis, providing support and solidarity for those facing illegal evictions, and organising large-scale protests.CMAT’s passionate, witty, defiant Euro-Country is part of that political milieu: it is a call to action to Irish people to reject the stranglehold of these parties, and to work towards better things together.Emer McHugh is an Irish writer and academic based in BelfastExplore more on these topicsIrelandOpinionPop and rockAusterityEconomicsEuropecommentShareReuse this content"

This failure has helped drive us into a housing disaster, where homes are treated as commodities rather than as the foundation of human dignity.The housing system in Australia is failing because it is designed for profit, not people. It encourages us to treat housing as a business activity rather than as a means of meeting fundamental human needs.Last resort: when the only option left amid Australia’s housing crisis is a motelRead moreI grew up in public housing in Moorabbin in south-east Melbourne in the 1950s and 60s. I do not romanticise that upbringing but it had one thing going for it: access to housing. While the housing commission was a somewhat ominous presence in the background, our large, working-poor family had a home. Low-income families like ours could afford to rent or even buy a basic house (or flat) without experiencing much or any financial stress. Homelessness was very low.The system back then more-or-less met the needs of most people for affordable housing. There was a much better balance between demand for and supply of that kind of housing.It was not perfect. For example, the supply of housing for the growing population was increased far too much by society sprawling outward rather than inward or upward. The system served First Peoples poorly. It took a long time for women and children fleeing violence in their own home to be given access to emergency housing. But human need, not profit-making, was the central purpose of the system.Things could not be worse by comparison now. Ordinary working people and families cannot afford to buy or rent a home without parental help (which many don’t have) or going into crushing financial stress.Proof positive of the failure of our housing system are the visibly rising numbers of older women sleeping in their cars; it shocks the conscience of the community that they should be compelled to do so. We should be ashamed of ourselves. I know that I am.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailHomelessness is high and not falling. Especially among older women, people living with mental illness and First Peoples. Yet we know from government action during the Covid era that it could be brief, rare and non-recurring.For all the justified celebrations of individual initiatives, public and private, we are still barely catching up, and may never get there. The recently announced plan tobring forward the expanded first home buyer deposit schememight help a bit, but the backlog of unmet need for affordable housing is so vast that even the increased funding and current plans fall well short of what’s required.Engineer who helped build Melbourne’s public housing towers condemns plan to demolish ‘icons’Read moreWe are facing chronic housing problems decades in the making, systemic in nature and inter-generational in magnitude. The fairness and stability of our society are at risk now and into the future. We need to put something enduring into the system that represents the fundamental needs of people - which is why I am supporting a Victorian Greens private member’s bill to enshrine the human right to housing in law. This will not only help to fix Victoria’s chronic housing problems but will also help to ensure that they do not happen again. And it has national implications.It would set a new foundation. It would ensure housing policy is guided by people’s needs, not profit motives, and it would guard against repeating the same mistakes in the future. It would be a gamechanger that would put strong pressure on the system to meet those needs always and for everyone.It is going to take some big thinking and brave actions over a long period of time to turn the system around. But it can be done. The housing system is not failing because it is beset by so-called “wicked” public policy problems of the kind that cannot be solved. What is wicked is our failure to fix the problems.The system is failing because we as a society are making the wrong kinds of choices, as we have over a long period of time.

He explains why he’s battling TikTok – but embracing AIMon 25 Aug 2025 11.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 25 Aug 2025 11.13 EDTShareDarren Aronofsky’s new film is a blast from the past; a half-cut retro tour of late-1990s New York. Beetling around the tatty East Village, casually framing the twin towers downtown, it lifts the lid on a time that has been and gone: when the city was a melting pot of miscreants and misfits, when lowly bar staff could still afford Gotham rents,, and when every car came equipped with a cigarette lighter. “Don’t they have those any more?” says Aronofksy, frowning at his untouched cup of herbal tea. “I don’t know, maybe not. It’s been many years since I smoked a cigarette.”Caught Stealing, he says, could almost be his parallel-universe first movie, given that it’s set in 1998, around the time he was shooting his actual first film, Pi, on the same East Side streets. He was in his late 20s back then, subsisting on pizza and living in a fifth-floor walk-up. He was anxious and ambitious; he had his eyes on the prize. He now thinks he ought to have enjoyed himself more.‘There are probably more jokes in the first 10 minutes of this than in my entire body of work’He’s nostalgic, but so what? It doesn’t mean he’s not right. “The 90s were such a remarkable time, an exciting time to be alive. It was a lot more loose. There was a sense of innocence. The Soviet Union was gone. Climate change wasn’t on 99% of people’s minds and the big scandal was Bill Clinton having an extramarital affair. People were looking forward to the new millennium. It was going to be The Jetsons. It was going to be sci-fi.” The director grins and shakes his head. “We weren’t all living in a state of existential terror.”View image in fullscreen‘I don’t want to shout at clouds’ … Aronofsky.Photograph: Mike Marsland/WireImageAronofsky is now 56 and has spent the bulk of his career on the darker end of the street. His films are a rogues’ gallery of brawlers and bawlers, extending from the sweaty contortions of The Wrestler and Black Swan through to the anguished operatics of Requiem for a Dream and Mother. Super-heavy, he says, super-intense. Except that the world turned so black that he wanted to make something light, or at least lighter than his usual brand of Sturm und Drang. He’s like the film-maker hero fromSullivan’s Travels, Preston Sturges’s Depression-era classic, who belatedly learns the value of entertainment and escapism.“Absolutely,” he says. “Sullivan’s Travels – that’s a huge touchstone for me. But also Hitchcock’s thrillers, Martin Scorsese’sAfter Hours, and a movie like Frantic, with Harrison Ford. I like those films that feature an ordinary hero. The common man who finds himself out of his depth.”In the case of Caught Stealing, that man is Hank Thompson, a baseball whizz turned slacker bartender, nicely embodied byAustin Butler, star of 2022’s Elvis. Hank has a mysterious key to a safe full of loot and various criminal gangs on his tail. The cops are no help and may even be outright crooked. With its hurried setup complete, Caught Stealing proceeds to run wild alongside Manhattan’s riotous 90s fauna, through a neighbourhood of wholesalers and meat-lockers, back yards and dive bars.Matt Smith plays an expat London punk who has to open the sun-roof to accommodate his turmeric-coloured mohawk. Liev Schreiber and Vincent D’Onofrio crop up as orthodox Jewish brothers who lament the shabby state of the city even as they blow holes in it with their shotguns. The film is based on a 2004 novel by Charlie Huston, although Aronofsky says that it was effectively co-written by the city, the locations shaping and changing the action. Fast-paced and punchy, Caught Stealing is a welcome corrective to Aronofsky’s previous picture, The Whale.View image in fullscreenAnguished … Ellen Burstyn in Requiem for a Dream.Photograph: Ronald GrantI’m worrying, though, that we may be slightly mis-selling its tone. The film is violent and bloody and borderline nihilistic. It only looks light compared to the other movies he’s made. “People are calling it a comedy,” he says. “IMDb is calling it a comedy. And I’m like, ‘Really?’ I mean, there’s definitely some laughs. There are probably more jokes in the first 10 minutes of this than in my entire body of work. But a comedy, I don’t know. It’s more a romp, a hoot, a caper. There’s a lot of the Lower East Side in the mix.”If someone invents fire, you don’t say ‘Let’s not mess with it because it might burn down the house’New York still has soul, he insists. At its heart, it’s the same city that he remembers from his youth. It’s the people who’ve changed; nowadays, everyone’s on their phone. That’s the other key reason why he made Caught Stealing: he wanted to create something that was fun enough to lure people back to the cinema. “That’s the mission these days. We’re in a war with meme culture. With TikTok and Instagram stories. People’s attention is no longer on storytelling. But storytelling is so valuable for humanity.”He frowns again at his cup of tea. Its presence seems to irk him. “Here’s the litmus test,” he says. “Every person who reads this article will have a memory of a favourite movie where they can remember exactly where they were when they saw it, and exactly how they felt when that two-hour journey was over. But there is no one who has sat through a two-hour chunk of TikTok who will remember anything about it at all. There is no emotional defining moment. They are two completely different experiences. And yet it’s getting harder and harder to get people to see movies.”View image in fullscreenContortions … Natalie Portman in Black Swan (2010).Photograph: Fox Searchlight/AllstarHe’s hardly alone in his thinking; most big-name directors feel the same. Where he breaks from the script, though, is in his embrace of AI. In May, the director announced the launch of a bespoke new studio, Primordial Soup, in tandem with Google DeepMind. Under the terms of this partnership, Google provides generative AI tools to Aronofsky and his team, while they provide feedback that helps refine and develop the technology. AI more than anything else is viewed as the greatest threat to cinema, so I’m wondering precisely what Aronofksy gets from the deal.“Well, this is the new front in the war on meme culture,” he says. “These tools are coming. They’re being used at an incredible adoption rate, but they’re mostly being used for slop. So I feel that, as storytellers, we need to harness these tools to help us do our work. There are a lot of artists who are fighting against AI, but I don’t see that as making any sense. If we don’t shape these tools, somebody else will.”“You keep calling them tools,” I begin. “They are tools,” he shoots back. But we’re not talking about putting a new paintbrush in the hands of an artist. We’re talking about potentially replacing the artist. “No, no, that’s not happening,” he says, properly vexed by the notion. “People are still going to be making films in the traditional way. But the technology is happening, the tools are happening. So it’s like if someone invents fire. You don’t say, ‘Oh, let’s not mess with this because it might burn down our house.’ There’s never been a technology that shows up that people aren’t going to use.”View image in fullscreen‘An exciting time to be alive’ … Butler with Zoe Kravitz in Caught Stealing.Photograph: Niko TaverniseIt was fear of an unchained, omnivorousAI that prompted the 2023 writers and actors’ strike in Hollywood. So I’m assuming Aronofsky’s position makes him a rarity among his peers. “Yeah, publicly I am,” he admits. “But I’ve been in touch with so many people who are deeply curious. And again: it’s already happening. There’s a generation of young people already playing with these tools. So we’re going to see new types of images and a lot of content that’s different – that’s not just mimicking other movies but is really doing something new.”We’ve been talking over tea for a little under an hour. We started in grungy 1990s New York; we’re ending up in the future, in the brave new sci-fi world. Despite all the dangers, that’s probably the right trajectory. The past can be golden, but it can also be a trap.“I don’t want to be one of those old men shouting at clouds,” he says. “Or shouting at the TV set, ‘Elvis Presley’s moving his hips and he needs to be banned.’ The world is changing. I’m trying to lean into the excitement. It’s time to shut up, stop complaining and dance.”Caught Stealing is out in the UK on 29 AugustExplore more on these topicsDarren AronofskyAustin ButlerMatt SmithCrime filmsComedy filmsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

We wrote the song after watching the Frank Sinatra film’Interviews byDave SimpsonMon 25 Aug 2025 10.26 EDTLast modified on Mon 25 Aug 2025 11.19 EDTShareRobert Hodgens, AKA Bobby Bluebell, songwriter, guitar, vocalsI first glimpsed Siobhan Fahey at my publisher’s offices. Later that day, when I was being interviewed by Smash Hits, I told the interviewer: “I really fancy Siobhan from Bananarama.” The next night, she was at our concert, at the front. I remember saying to my bandmates Ken and Dave McCluskey: “I’m gonna get off with her.”We met in the car park and liked each other. Soon afterwards, I moved down from Glasgow – into a London flat with the glamorous Bananarama girls. It was like the Beatles in Help! One night, we were lying in bed watching the Frank Sinatra film Young at Heart, one of my dad’s favourites, and talking about our backgrounds. Siobhan is Irish but her father was in the British army, so she’d moved around and changed schools a lot. I think she had just wanted to escape, so we started writing lyrics about how her parents had got married young to have sex and have kids, because that’s what people did then. It was the first time since I’d left home that I also realised what our parents had done for us, which fed into the line: “How come I love them now? How come I love them more? / When all I wanted to do when I was old was to walk out the door?”Bananarama recorded Young at Heart, but their version didn’t quite have whatever their big hits had at the time. Our record company boss Roger Ames suggested the Bluebells record it. We were big pals with Dexys Midnight Runners so thought of asking Helen O’Hara, who played fiddle on Come on Eileen, to play on our version. Roger said that would be “too much cross-pollination”, but the old story about us finding a fiddle player in the pub isn’t true – Bobby Valentino, who played on the single, was a session-player who laid the part down in a few minutes, and Lawrence Donegan came up with a killer new bassline.In 1984, the song got to No 8 but then nine years later it was used on a car advert and it spent four weeks at No 1. The pope actually complained that the lyrics promoted divorce, which I thought was really funny – although my mum is Italian so she wasn’t best pleased.Siobhan Fahey,songwriterBob’s Smash Hits story is sheer fantasy and makes me sound like a stalker – but Bananarama did share offices in Covent Garden with the Bluebells. We were penniless and on the dole, so we’d go in there to use the phones or steal toilet roll. I met Bob there. He was – and is – the most charming, positive and inspiring person, so he sweet-talked his way into my affections and I took to him big time.View image in fullscreen‘An amazing time to be young’ … Siobhan Fahey and Bobby Bluebell.Bananarama had been living in a leaky loft space above the Sex Pistols’ rehearsal room, although we were all in a council flat when Bob used to come down and stay in my room. We weren’t long out of school, we were practically children, but it was an incredible time to be in London. We’d go dancing in the Wag Club and everyone there was in a band: Wham!, Culture Club, Sade.Once Bananarama started having hits, we had to disguise ourselves to sign on for the dole in case they’d seen us on Top of the Pops. Then suddenly we needed material for an album. I remember Bob sitting with a guitar and going: “Let’s write a song.” He came up with the title Young at Heart after we watched the film, then I started writing lyrics about my relationship with my parents. You can hear the difference between our personalities in the song. My words reek with pain, his are more loving: two very different experiences of growing up.Bananarama recorded Young at Heart as a northern soul stomper. We’d wanted Soft Cell’s producer but were told he only did synth bands, so instead we ended up with Barry Blue. It’s a flawed production but I like our version, although it doesn’t have the fiddle hook, which is so important to the Bluebells’ one. The song’s mix of dark and cheery lyrics with uptempo, uplifting music reminds me of Tamla Motown, which was the reason we formed a girl group. It was such an amazing time to be young, and we were two kids who wrote a song about our parents from the heart.The Bluebells’ 1984 debut Sisters is out now as an extended remastered double album/3CD/DVD setExplore more on these topicsPop and rockHow we madefeaturesShareReuse this content"

No surprise, then, that the most powerful moments in Sadie Pearson’s play are when actor Merida Beasley interrupts the male-dominated action to deliver impassioned and graphic accounts of violence against women.That she is credited only as “Woman” is not an oversight. It is an ironic comment on her invisibility. As far as hate-fuelled comedian Rodney Black (Ben Willows) is concerned, she could be anyone. Whether one-night stand or admin assistant, he will not even ask her name.She and women like her are the ones who suffer the consequences of Black’s onstage rants. He and his agent (Bertie Taylor-Smith) see his routines as edgy and provocative, testing the limits of social consensus in the name of artistic freedom. In truth, they are little more than incitements to violence. When a male fan takes him at his word and murders a stranger, Black’s career hangs in the balance.In this way, Pearson makes the connection between men having a laugh and women being safe. Black’s material is not merely a thought experiment and his success is not merely a symptom of a culture letting off steam. The attitudes he promotes have real-world consequences.These are weighty themes that require sensitive handling, but too often in Hen Ryan’s production, the playwright appears not to be in control of the demons she raises. Black, despite an anachronistic commitment to hand-writing letters to his fans, is one-dimensionally loathsome. In the absence of charm or laughs, he offers only bile. His agent is even more blunt in his lust for success.Compared with the many real-life comedians who play to the lowest common denominator, Black lacks the comic chops to be anything but offensive.

In times gone by, people would watch television by simply turning their television on, watching whatever was showing at that precise moment and then complaining about it. But now, as you find yourself forced to pick from every single film and series ever made, you feel overwhelmed. You spend entire evenings scrolling through submenu after submenu, glazing over as your inability to find something to watch ossifies into dissociative panic.Can’t pay, won’t pay: impoverished streaming services are driving viewers back to piracyRead moreThe challenge for the streamers is how to effectively curate this infinite content. In the past they have done this by prioritising new releases, or showing you what everyone else is watching, or sharpening their algorithms to second-guess what you want to watch based on what you have already watched. But finally – finally –Netflixhas cracked it. And it has achieved this with science.Sorry, not science,bullshit. Because this weekend Netflix officially launched itsAstrology Hub. Now, after all these years, subscribers can at last pick something to watch based on a loose collection of personality quirks determined by the position of the planets at the time of their birth. Doesn’t that sound great?So, for instance, I am a Leo. And this means that, when I enter the Netflix Astrology Hub and scroll down a bit, I am informed that “Leos have main character energy”. And as such, it means I should watch The Crown, or The King, or Queen Charlotte: A Bridgerton Story, or Emily in Paris, or The Kissing Booth 2, or that Cilla Black biopic that ITV made a few years ago. And I think that, as a heterosexual 45-year-old man, Netflix has absolutely cracked it.Sure, I have already watched most of these for work, and I flat-out disliked almost all of them. But if Netflix says that every single person born within a specific window has the exact same personality, then sure. Tonight, after flopping down on to my sofa at the end of another long day trying to locate the right balance between quality family time and the financial imperative to work, I will watch Emily in bloody Paris. And I will like it, because Netflix told me that I would.View image in fullscreenNetflix’s astrology hub.Photograph: NetflixNow, the naysayers among you will point out that all these choices seem geared to appeal to young girls, because young girls are statistically the demographic most likely to believe in the zodiac, and so the Netflix Astrology Hub is essentially just a bit of a grift designed to push content at one specific group. And you might even go further, by pointing out that astrology is a pseudoscience that has repeatedly proved itself to have no scientific validity whatsoever. To which I respond: of course you think that, you’re a Virgo.And anyway, if there is any message at all behind the Netflix Astrology Hub, it is this: just be grateful that you’re not an Aquarius. Because while the other signs get off relatively lightly – Sagittarians (“bring adventure”) get Indiana Jones and the Spider-Verse, Capricorns (“activate boss mode”) get Hostage and Blackberry, and Virgos (“always hustling”) get Beef and Oppenheimer, the Aquarians are left to mournfully sift through the scraps.Aquarians, according to Netflix, are “otherworldly” and that means their recommendations include the worst Men in Black film, the terrible Battleship film, a bizarre South Korean drama about a gynaecologist who falls in love on a space station and, of course, Rebel Moon – Part One: A Child of Fire. Does this seem like a deliberate decision on the part of Netflix to alienate a full 12th of its subscriber base? Probably, but maybe Aquarians lap this stuff up. I’m not a scientist, so I don’t know.But, still, here we are. Netflix has access to an almost unparalleled set of highly tailored data points about every single one of its subscribers. It knows what you watch, when you watch it and for how long. It knows, with granular precision, more about your viewing habits than you ever will. It changes the image for each piece of content it has, based on your specific desires, to better maximise clicks. By harnessing this universe of data, Netflix is able to individually drip-feed shows and films to you with such dead-on accuracy that it feels like magic. But, in a way, isn’t it better to just blankly state that all Libras like Peaky Blinders and be done with it? I am willing to say yes it is.Explore more on these topicsCultureNetflixUS televisionTelevisionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The former rock festival is a post-GCSE rite of passage, a place for many to don a daft hat, wear as little as possible, toast results or drown sorrows. Two years ago, Szmeriek – imagine the Streets’ Mike Skinner with a ’tache and trackies – was a special needs teacher before becoming a dazzling wordsmith, so draws on his backstory (and gets another cheer) when he tells the kid in the front row who failed all his exams: “It doesn’t matter. You will be someone.”Other hits include Skye Newman’s raw soul, dance producerSammy Virjiand besuited, sunglasses-wearing New York one-man electronic bandHarrison SmithAKA the Dare, whose brilliantly jerky set is like watching Jarvis Cocker fronting LCD Soundsystem. Kids waiting for rap at the main stage look bewildered by Amy Taylor’s raucous, shouty Aussie punks Amyl and the Sniffers. Trippie Redd’s affecting blend of the plaintive and unsettling is beautifully illustrated when a father plays football with his toddlers as the American raps about putting someone in their casket. Otherwise, with fewer stages and big names than previous years, the first day feels somewhat undersold and underpowered. US rap superstar Travis Scott’s headlining set builds in intensity as pyro and fireworks erupt around him, but ends abruptly 35 minutes early, without explanation, to a smattering of boos.Saturday is visibly busier and while co-headlinerChappell Roanis second on the bill here (she topped it in Reading on Sunday, alternating with Hozier) she pulls by far the biggest crowd all weekend, a sea of pink cowboy hats. Continuing her rapid ascent since 2023’sThe Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess, the American singer-songwriter is sensational. With a fantasy castle stage set, outfit like an Andy Warhol take on Elizabethan England and female musicians reminiscent of Prince’s band, subjects from LGBTQ+ issues to feminism to meltdowns are channelled into joyous, stylish, era-defining anthems. Few artists have owned the field so effectively in years. Irish singer-songwriter Hozier has to follow that, but the crowd stay put and his cosier vibe explodes into fire when he speaks up for Kneecap, Palestine and equality, and closes with a blazing Take Me to Church.View image in fullscreenThe demonic commander … Oli Sykes of Bring Me the Horizon performing at Leeds festival.Photograph: Katja Ogrin/Redferns for ABASunday is rock day, and Sheffield pop-metal kingsBring Me the Horizondeliver a postmodern eye- and ear-melter of a headline set where the band are stars in their own gigantic video game. Singer Oli Sykes is the demonic commander and the arm-swaying crowd and circle pits become part of the spectacle. Overall, though, it bodes well to see so many triumphs from newer artists, particularly Wunderhorse, who have gone off like a rocket since playing the BBC Introducing stage here last year and pack the hi-tech, usually dance-focused Chevron stage. For all the obvious echoes of Nirvana and REM, the Cornwall-based band’s undefinable edge – not least in wiry frontman Jacob Slater – makes them utterly compelling, and they enrapture an audience of all ages.Explore more on these topicsReading and Leeds festivalPop and rockChappell RoanAmyl and the SniffersTravis ScottBring Me the HorizonFestivalslive music reviewsShareReuse this content"

I went over to meet them and it was just my friend there. I said: ‘You made me ride all the way down here? You made it sound so important.’ And then in walkedGeorge Harrisonwith Mal Evans.” Evans was the Beatles’ former road manager.

It is located on a strip mall in the Tarzana neighbourhood of Los Angeles, alongside a McDonald’s and a nail bar. It would be easy to blink and miss Norman’s Rare Guitars, unaware of a clientele that includes Slash, Billy Corgan, Dave Grohl, Kiefer Sutherland, Melissa Etheridge and Beck dropping by to check out the high-end stock, alongside parents buying instruments for their kids – where else would Chris Martin and Gwyneth Paltrow go when their sonMoses wanted a guitarfor his 16th birthday? The store – and with it Harris’s life and career – is now the subject of a documentary of the same name.Virtuoso blues guitarist Joe Bonamassa may be Harris’s most valuable customer. He has one of the world’s finest collections of Fender and Gibson guitars, many bought from the proprietor’s prized stash. He says Harris is every bit as much of a draw as the instruments he sells, like “an electromagnet” attracting people from all over the world, yet Harris doesn’t seem to realise he is the star of the show.It all began with a secondhand bass guitar. Fifty years ago, Harris was playing keyboards in a Miami band when his bandmates asked him to fill in on bass. He scoured the local paper for a used instrument and landed on an early Fender Jazz bass. “Everyone went gaga over that Fender Jazz,” he says. This included his friend Jaco Pastorius, considered by many to be the greatest bass player of all time. “I was offered more money for it than I paid for it, so I noticed that there was a market and thought maybe I could make a few dollars chasing down instruments like that and selling them on. And it just kind of rapidly built.”Things were also taking off with Harris’s band, Katmandu – Bobby Caldwell was the singer, Little Richard and his brother Peyton Penniman were their managers and they had supported the likes of Jimi Hendrix and Canned Heat – and were urged to relocate from Florida to California, so that’s what Harris and his wife, Marlene, did. The decision was made easier by the availability of instruments on the west coast, which inadvertently contributed to the end of Harris’s career as a pro musician – business grew so quickly that he had no time for much else.“It was kind of a smorgasbord in LA,” he says. “There was every instrument I had ever heard about but never actually seen, all right there.” Before long, there were 50 or 60 used guitars in the couple’s apartment, bought after scouring local newspapers and visiting pawn shops.“A lot of the music stores didn’t want to touch used instruments back then. And they would laugh at me and say things like: ‘You’re paying more for this old guitar than I am for this new guitar.’ I just used to think: ‘OK, keep laughing, and just keep selling them to me.’”Harris says he knew in his gut that American-made guitars from the mid-1950s to early 60s would one day be hugely desirable – “future antiques” he calls them – and he was right. While you couldn’t argue that he single-handedly created the vintage guitar market, he certainly shaped it, and there is no one else who was as ahead of the curve as Harris or as knowledgable about the intricacies and idiosyncrasies of each model. He also knew when to say no to a guitar and walk away.View image in fullscreen‘Future antiques’ … Harris in his store.Photograph: Jeremy Danger“I was never interested in just amassing guitars, or having multiples of the same guitar. I wanted guitars that were hardly played and all original – just prime examples, really.”The strategy paid off that day in 1973 when Harrison came calling. Harrison was seeking a replacement for Lucy, his one-of-a-kind Gibson Les Paul that had been stolen earlier in the year. It was a 1957 Goldtop refinished in red that had formerly been owned by John Sebastian of the Lovin’ Spoonful and Rick Derringer of the McCoys, before being bought by Eric Clapton and given to Harrison. Clapton used the instrument on the Beatles’ While My Guitar Gently Weeps.After the theft, Lucy was sold to a musician in LA. Once Harrison had tracked down the guitar, the guitar’s new owner argued that he had purchased Lucy in good faith but said he would return it to Harrison if he got him another 1950s Les Paul and a Fender Precision bass in exchange.This is when a mutual friend became involved, who knew that Harris had three 1950s Les Pauls at his apartment. When Harrison visited, he bought two 1958 Les Paul Standards – one for the trade, one for himself that he fell in love with. Today, each of those guitars, even without the Harrison connection, would sell for more than £250,000.“We actually spent the day together. I then went to this place he was renting in the Hollywood Hills. Ravi Shankar, the Indian sitarist, was there. To me, the Beatles were bigger than the pope or the president or whoever. I just kept looking at him – I couldn’t believe it was happening.”Harrison offered Harris his Gretsch Country Gentleman, used in his Beatles days, in part payment. But Harris passed – the biggest mistake he ever made, he says now. “I’m not a huge Gretsch fan, and more importantly, I didn’t think anybody would ever believe that I’d spent the day with George and bought his Beatles guitar.”He might not have made that deal, but they did smoke a lot of hash together that day. “It was like having a glass of wine with someone in those days and in those circles,” he says. “I did a lot to destroy a number of brain cells in the 60s and 70s. But I’m still mostly functioning, and I definitely still remember that day.”Robbie Robertson – lead guitarist with the Band, who backed Bob Dylan – was a regular customer, having replied to an ad Harris placed in the LA Times looking for guitars and being drawn in by Harris’s warmth and unbeatable stock. Not that Harris recognised him when he saw him, having never seen the Band perform live, despite being a fan. “He was really impressed that I had a lot of the stuff he was looking for, so I told him to bring some friends. Not long after, he came back with Bob Dylan andJoni Mitchell.”View image in fullscreenHarris on the roof of Norman’s Rare Guitars in Los Angeles.Photograph: Jeremy DangerHarris and Robertson’s friendship was cemented during the filming of The Last Waltz, the Band’s 1978 concert film, directed by Martin Scorsese: most of the instruments and amplifiers featured were loaned from Harris. Robertson had recently bought his 1954 Stratocaster from Harris, then dipped it in bronze. Robertson also makes an appearance in Norman’s Rare Guitars, in footage filmed just before his death in 2023. “He had cancer and didn’t have long left then,” says Harris. “But he said for me, he’d do it. He was such a great guy and a good friend.”The Last Waltz wasn’t Harris’s first involvement with the film industry. Hal Ashby knew exactly who to ask to supply instruments for his 1976 Woody Guthrie biopic Bound for Glory. Come 1984, there was only one person who could provide the required level of unicorn-like guitars to fill out Nigel Tufnel’s collection in This Is Spın̈al Tap.Most famously, Harris loaned the producers of Back to the Future the red Gibson played by Marty McFly at the Enchantment Under the Sea dance. As has been well documented, the guitar in question – a Gibson ES-345 – wasn’t released until 1958, three years after the film’s 1955 setting. Harris suggested a period-correct Fender Stratocaster or a Gibson ES-5 Switchmaster, but director Robert Zemeckis refused, insisting that a time traveller like McFly wouldn’t be constrained by such pettiness.After it was returned, Harris sold the guitar. Decades later, a woman walked into his shop offering to sell it back to him for $1m. After he stopped laughing, he said no, although his shop manager at the time, Mark Agnesi, tried to twist his arm, saying that if he had the money, he would buy it himself. Agnesi is now director of Gibson, and in a position to spend big on such a storied instrument on behalf of the company. Except no one knows where it is. Agnesi launchedLost to the Futureearlier this year, a global appeal for the guitar. The search goes on.Regular viewers of Norman’s Rare Guitars’ YouTube channel will be familiar with Harris’s warehouse, where he has squirrelled away hundreds of museum-grade instruments for a rainy day. Its location is known to only a handful of people.“There was this rumour for years about that stash,” says Bonamassa. “I’d known Norm for years – and spent plenty of money with him – before I was invited out there. It was like that scene at the end of Raiders of the Lost Ark – that long shot with all the crates. It was unbelievable.”View image in fullscreenJoe Bonamassa in the documentary film Norman’s Rare Guitars.Photograph: Devin J DilmoreBonamassa has been to the warehouse many times since, and says he always goes with a heavy heart, knowing that he’s going to see some “holy grail guitars” that will certainly leave a dent in his wallet. “If Norm stashed it away, it meant it was a cut above – the cleanest, the straightest, the most original. I went there last year and bought five guitars, among them the last of Norm’s blond dot-neck Gibson 335s and a Fender Broadcaster.” (Guitar enthusiasts will drool at the very mention.)A portion of the film is dedicated to Harris’s recent health scares. He had cancer, then had a heart attack while undergoing treatment. Mortality is clearly on his mind, not least what should happen to the business, and all those guitars, when he’s no longer around to shake the hand of the person buying them.“I had to get things in order.” he says. “Just in case. So I’m going to try to leave as little a mess as I can.”“He’s 75,” says Bonamassa. “For years, he’s been saying to me, ‘I want you to take over the store.’ But I have a job already. The problem is, if Norm’s not there to run it, then it’s just a namesake. It would just be a brand. When you take him away, you take away the heart and the soul. It wouldn’t be the same. There’s only one Norman Harris.”Norman’s Rare Guitars is available torent or buy here.Explore more on these topicsMusicDocumentary filmsThis Is Spinal TapGeorge HarrisonThe BandJoni MitchellBob DylanfeaturesShareReuse this content"

That means it’s time for more visiting orchestras. The Leipzig Gewandhaus and the Melbourne Symphony are among this week’s arrivals. But the past weekend belonged to the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra. No visit by Amsterdam’s finest is to be missed, but these two Proms in less than 24 hours brought something more – the starry presence ofKlaus Mäkelä, who becomes the RCO’s chief conductor in 2027 and who currently has the musical world at his feet.The obvious challenge in judging whether the two will become a perfect fit is that the RCO are simply so good. The warmth and precision of the Amsterdam string sound is legendary, while the RCO offers listeners wind playing to die for. So strong is the squad that, like a top football club, many principals who played in the visit’s first concert of Berio and Mahler were rotated in the second, consisting of Mozart, Prokofiev and Bartók.View image in fullscreenPlaying to die for… Klaus Mäkelä conducts the Royal Concertgebouw orchestra at the BBC Proms.Photograph: Chris Christodoulou/BBCBut Mäkelä is himself a Galáctico signing and the hall was duly packed. Still only 29, he brought two big works – Mahler’s fifth symphony in the first concert and Bartok’s Concerto for Orchestra in the second – not forgetting a truly thrilling Kodály encore to close with. The big pieces were fabulously played, of course, but it was the instrumental details rather than the overall conception that made the biggest mark. There was too little sense of symphonic architecture in Mäkelä’s approach to the Mahler, while his Bartók emphasised the work’s showpiece qualities at the expense of the sense of distance and loneliness that haunts the score.Mahler, though, is in the RCO’s blood. The composer himself conducted this orchestra. Decades later, Bernard Haitink’s Amsterdam Mahler performances became legendary. Mäkelä’s relentless approach had little in common with Haitink’s more measured tread, nor withMark Elder’s cerebral takeon the same symphony in last year’s Proms. From the expertly phrased funeral march trumpet call onwards, wind playing was exceptional, as were quieter passages more generally. The strings caressed the Adagietto’s lingering phrases and Mäkelä brought fine swagger and propulsion to the rondo-finale. As an interpretation, though, it never quite established itself.Unexpectedly, Luciano Berio’s Rendering, which preceded the Mahler, fared better. This substantial three-movement piece feeds some of Schubert’s late symphonic sketches through Berio’s fertile and ingenious late 20th-century sensibility. The result, especially when it is as well done as it was here, is fresh and exploratory, as Schubertian melodies modulate into Berio’s mysterious fragments and colours. If the test of a good performance is that it stays in the head, then this one did just that.The same was true ofJanine Jansen’s account of Prokofiev’s first violin concerto on the following day. Jansen commanded the performance, her playing technically dazzling and musically intense, with Mäkelä and the RCO providing impeccably unobtrusive accompaniment.Finally, hats off to Mäkelä for opening the second concert with an elegantly played example of something that has become too much of aPromsrarity in recent years – a Mozart symphony, in this case the D major “Paris”.Listen again on BBC Soundsuntil 12 October.

Austin Butler stars as ex-baseball-player Hank Thompson who gets mixed up in the seedy underbelly of crime in 90s New York.29 AugustThe RosesBenedict Cumberbatch and Olivia Colman star in this new version of the acrid satire of marital breakdown last filmed in 1989 asThe War of the Roseswith Michael Douglas and Kathleen Turner and audiences will be keen to see if this new movie matches its predecessor’s devastating final shot. Certainly Cumberbatch and Colman look like an A-lister clash.29 AugustYoung MothersView image in fullscreenAn assertion of hope … Young MothersPhotograph: Christine PlenusAn amazing return to form for the Belgian veteran masters of classic social-realism the Dardenne brothers. The movie follows the lives of teen mothers and mothers-to-be at a state home – gentleness, compassion and love are the keynotes of this quietly outstanding movie. The straightforward assertion of hope through giving and asking for help is powerful.29 AugustLittle Trouble GirlsThis elegant and mysterious debut picture from Slovenian director Urška Djukić reinvents the cliched idea of a Catholic girl’s sexual awakening: an all-girl teenage choir is under the thumb of a demanding and charismatic choirmaster, who isn’t above humiliating girls if they displease him in any way.29 AugustSpinal Tap II: The End ContinuesView image in fullscreenElton John, Christopher Guest, Harry Shearer, and Michael McKean in Spinal Tap II: The End Continues.Photograph: Bleecker Street & Authorized Spinal TapBefore there was Ricky Gervais, before there was Steve Carell … there was the rock colossusSpinal Tap, whose 1980s comeback tour was famously the subject of a documentary, or … if you will … well, you know how it goes. Now a sequel reunites us with the band, in their mature and reflective silver years, still rocking hard and finding that sex-positivity has brought them back into fashion. What’s wrong with being sexy?12 SeptemberA Big Bold Beautiful JourneyThe Korean auteur with thenom de cinémaKogonada (his actual name is as closely guarded as Elena Ferrante’s in the literary world) takes a big swing with this romantic drama about two strangers – played by Margot Robbie and Colin Farrell – who unite after an extraordinary journey. In the hands of anyone else it could be slushy, but Kogonada has a light and expert touch.19 SeptemberView image in fullscreenPaul Thomas Anderson returns … Regina Hall in One Battle After Another.Photograph: TCD/Prod.DB/AlamyOne Battle After AnotherFor movie-hipsters and superfans this is the big one. Director Paul Thomas Anderson returns with a movie inspired by Thomas Pynchon’s 1990 novel Vineland, another black comic riff on the war on drugs, the war on terror, the paranoid style of American politics and much else. Leonardo DiCaprio and Sean Penn star as two ex-revolutionaries trying to save the former’s daughter, played by Chase Infiniti.26 SeptemberHimA drama on classic underdog sports movie lines: Tyriq Withers plays Cameron, a promising but callow young American football player who gets the chance to train with the charismatic quarterback Isaiah White – a serious role for comedy veteran Marlon Wayans – and the experience is unnerving. Jordan Peele produces.3 OctoberThe Smashing MachineOne of the Safdie brothers – Benny – goes solo directing this true-life sports movie, inspired by the 2002 HBO documentary of the same title, starring Dwayne Johnson as the humungous MMA fighter Mark Kerr and Emily Blunt as his wife, Dawn. The action will surely show that the hero is more than just a machine.3 OctoberView image in fullscreenSmart and compassionate … Urchin.Photograph: Devisio Pictures and Somesuch/BFI Film/BBC/Tricky KnotUrchinBritish actor Harris Dickinson makes a really impressive directorial debut with Urchin, a smart and compassionate picture about homelessness: engaging, humorous and sympathetically acted by Frank Dillane as Mike, a guy who has been on the streets for five years. Intelligent and heartbreakingly vulnerable.3 OctoberRoofmanJeffrey Manchester was a former US army reserve soldier who became a pop-culture antihero in the 1990s for robbing branches of McDonald’s by breaking in through the roof – for which he was dubbed the “roofman” – and then waiting in the lavatories for opening time, at which point he would storm out and empty the cash registers. Channing Tatum plays Jeffrey and Derek Cianfrance directs.17 OctoberGood FortuneView image in fullscreenDeadpan style … Keanu Reeves as Gabriel and Sandra Oh as Martha in Good Fortune.Photograph: Eddy Chen/LionsgateIn this trading-places comedy, Keanu Reeves brings his imitable unreadable deadpan style to the role of Gabriel, a “budget” angel who intervenes in the lives of lesser humans with mixed results. Writer-director Aziz Ansari stars as a stressed gig worker Arj, insecurely employed by Seth Rogen’s heartless plutocrat. Gabriel swaps their existences to show Arj that money isn’t everything. Or, actually, is it?17 OctoberAfter the HuntA #MeToo story of American academe from screenwriter Nora Garrett and director Luca Guadagnino. Julia Roberts stars as an Ivy League professor Alma Olsson who is put under pressure when her friend and colleague, played by Andrew Garfield, is accused of sexual assault. Ayo Edebiri plays Alma’s star pupil Maggie.22 OctoberA House of DynamiteA big, brassy, real-time apocalypse scenario from action specialist Kathryn Bigelow, whose title may remind you of Sam Goldwyn’s apocryphal remark in 1945: “This atom bomb … it’s dynamite!” Idris Elba and Rebecca Ferguson star in a white-knuckle drama set in the White House as officials deal with what appears to be an incoming nuclear missile attack.24 OctoberSpringsteen: Deliver Me from NowhereView image in fullscreenBlue collar energy … Jeremy Allen White as Bruce Springsteen.Photograph: 20th Century StudiosPlaying a living icon is always tricky, and rock icon trickier still. Jeremy Allen White brings the blue-collar energy to take on the role ofBruce Springsteen, as he made his 1982 album Nebraska. Stephen Graham plays Bruce’s father, Douglas, and Jeremy Strong is Springsteen’s manager and producer Jon Landau.24 OctoberThe MastermindPossibly the most downbeat – and yet intriguing and hilarious – heist movie in history. Josh O’Connor stars as James, the art school dropout in 1960s Massachusetts who conceives a plan to rob the local art gallery with the help of tough guys that he has bizarrely recruited. Director Kelly Reichardt makes of him a rather Updikean figure who ends up on the run from the consequences of his own actions.24 OctoberBugoniaThe Onion joked that Greek auteur Yorgos Lanthimos now estimates he’s only three films away from hanging with Emma Stone outside work. His latest film brings him nearer to that goal. It’s a remake of the South Korean sci-fi comedy Save the Green Planet! in which Stone stars as the CEO of a drugs company who is kidnapped by two men who believe that she is a hostile alien.31 OctoberThe Running ManView image in fullscreenThriller-satire … Glen Powell in The Running Man.Photograph: Capital Pictures/AlamyA dystopian thriller-satire on the classic theme of TV being evil, directed by Edgar Wright and based on the 1982 novel by Stephen King – last filmed in 1987 with Arnold Schwarzenegger in the lead. Now the star is slightly less jacked: Glen Powell is Ben, a guy who takes part in a TV reality show in which he is chased across the world by guys out to kill him – and there’s a big cash prize if he can survive 30 days.7 NovemberThe Thing With FeathersA drama about grief, taken from the novella by Max Porter whose title modifies the Emily Dickinson quotation about hope.Benedict Cumberbatchplays a guy who, along with his two sons, has to deal with the terrible loss of his wife and their mother. Grief appears in the guise of a Ted Hughes-style crow.7 NovemberThe ChoralAn original screenplay by Alan Bennett has to be something to savour. Nicholas Hytner directs and Ralph Fiennes stars in the second notable choirmaster film of 2025: he is Dr Guthrie – who, in a small Yorkshire town in 1916, where most of the menfolk are absent, has to recruit a choir of young boys and girls to sing Elgar’s The Dream of Gerontius. Their innocence and the beauty of the music make a fierce contrast to the war’s horror.7 NovemberTrain DreamsView image in fullscreenFragile masculinity … Felicity Jones with Joel Edgerton in Train Dreams.Photograph: Adolpho VelosoBased on the novella by Denis Johnson and directed by Clint Bentley (who recently made the much-lovedSing Sing), this is a drama about fragile masculinity. Joel Edgerton plays Robert, a railway worker whose life is secluded, vulnerable and lonely, as he spends so much time away from his wife but is poignantly aware of the beauty of the American landscape in which he finds himself.7 NovemberKeeperActor and film-maker Osgood Perkins had a breakthrough last year with his strange horror thrillerLonglegsand now he returns with another scary movie. Tatiana Maslany and Rossif Sutherland play Liz and Malcolm, a couple who escape for a cosy romantic getaway at … uh, oh … a secluded cabin. When Malcolm has to return briefly to the city to sort out some business, Liz finds herself alone with a terrible evil.14 NovemberNurembergIt is the beefy, lairy role that Russell Crowe was surely born to play. He is the Nazis’ Luftwaffe commander Hermann Göring in this tense postwar psychological drama, and Rami Malek plays Douglas Kelley, the US army psychiatrist tasked with examining and questioning Göring to see if he was fit to stand trial at Nuremberg. An unsettling battle of wits ensues.14 NovemberJay KellyView image in fullscreenFellini-esque journey … George Clooney as Jay Kelly.Photograph: Peter Mountain/NetflixGeorge Clooney is a Hollywood legend with old-school class who commands a lot of affection – and who could also use a hit. Perhaps this will be the one. The director and co-writer is Noah Baumbach, working with Emily Mortimer, and Clooney plays a superhandsome movie megastar of a certain age, with Adam Sandler as his agent, as they make a somewhat Fellini-esque journey across Europe surrounded by a carnival of fans.14 NovemberDie, My LoveLynne Ramsay brings the gothic-realist steam heat to this ferocious and blazingly visual study of a woman, played by Jennifer Lawrence with the passionate commitment reminiscent of Gena Rowlands, and her descent into bipolar disorder as she is left alone all day with a new baby in a rambling Montana house. Robert Pattinson plays her husband and Sissy Spacek is her stressed mother-in-law.14 NovemberBlue MoonView image in fullscreenMargaret Qualley and Ethan Hawke in Blue Moon.Photograph: Sabrina Lantos/Sony Pictures ClassicsSome fascinating casting here as Ethan Hawke plays the great lyricist Lorenz Hart, struggling with depression and alcoholism in 1943 (an era when these disorders were heartlessly described as being a maudlin drunk) and we see poor Hart at the opening night of Oklahoma!, which his former partner Richard Rodgers has written with a new collaborator: Oscar Hammerstein. He stumbles out early and we see him in the bar trying and failing to come to terms with what this obvious hit says about his own future.14 NovemberWicked: For GoodThe public and the pundits gave a thumbs up to thefirst partof this mighty screen adaptation of the stage musical Wicked (imagining the origin story of the Wicked Witch from The Wizard of Oz) and now in this second part we are reunited with Cynthia Erivo’s Elphaba and Ariana Grande’s Glinda – and also Jonathan Bailey’s hilarious Prince Fiyero.21 NovemberPillionView image in fullscreenUproarious … Harry Melling and Alexander Skarsgård in Pillion.Photograph: Element Pictures/BBC Film/BFIIt’s high time author Adam Mars-Jones had a presence in British cinema and here is an uproarious and tender adaptation of his novella Box Hill, a queer BDSM tale of biker romance and devotion with something of Alan Bennett, Tom of Finland and Wallace and Gromit. Alexander Skarsgård is the leather-clad alpha male Ray who likes the submissive style of Harry Melling’s sweet-natured Colin, and their relationship takes an unusual course.28 NovemberAvatar: Fire and AshJames Cameron’s Avatar movies are sometimes set to be gigantically successful while leaving no trace in the collective memory. If this new one is going to do the same thing, it’s going to take its time about it – this weighs in at three hours and 12 minutes. Sam Worthington and Zoe Saldaña return as Jake and Neytiri, who must struggle for survival in a changing world.19 DecemberMarty SupremeHere is the solo film from the other Safdie brother – Josh – and it’s another real-life sports movie, set in 1950s New York and starring Timothée Chalamet as the US ping pong champ Martin “Marty” Reisman, known as the Needle for his slight, feathery build. Safdie has tempted Gwyneth Paltrow away from her semi-retirement to play Marty’s love interest.26 December"

His legal team has argued that thecase should be thrown out,citing a technical error in how the charge was brought.Ó hAnnaidh was greeted byhundreds of supportersas he arrived at Westminster magistrates court for a hearing recently.When the charge was first announced earlier this year,Kneecapdescribed it as “political policing” and a “carnival of distraction” and vowed to “vehemently defend ourselves”.While their US tour dates have been cancelled, the band said on Monday that they had an upcoming surprise for US fans.“We will be sharing something very special for US fans next week so that we can still link with you all in October,” it reads. “It’s top secret for now, but all will be revealed next week.”The group confirmed that their planned Canadian shows in Vancouver and Toronto will still proceed as planned.The Belfast-based group – known for their political performances and outspoken support for Palestine – madeheadlinesin June during their Glastonbury set, where they led chants saying “fuck Keir Starmer,” referring to the UK prime minister.In April, the rap trio also made headlines fordisplaying statementsagainst Israel’s military campaign in Gaza at the Coachella festival.Explore more on these topicsKneecapEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

They added that the next series of the celebrity dance competition would begin on 20 September as planned.A statement from the Met said: “On Friday 22 August officers arrested a man in his 30s in east London on suspicion of rape and non-consensual intimate image abuse.“This is a joint investigation with Hertfordshire constabulary. The arrest follows a third-party allegation of sexual and drug-related offences.” The police urged anyone with any information to contact them, quoting 8479/22AUG, or Crimestoppers anonymously.Strictly Come Dancing was launched in 2004 and has been the BBC’s most notable weekend entertainment show ever since. The celebrity contestants for the next series wereannounced this month.The show has been hit by serious allegations about the behaviour of its performers in recent years. This month it was reported that the BBC had called in lawyers toinvestigate after claims that two of its stars used cocaine.The cocaine use allegations were reportedly made in a legal submission by the law firm Russells in March on behalf of the former contestant Wynne Evans, who was dropped by the BBC after apologising for using “inappropriate language” during the launch of the Strictly tour.It has been a difficult summer for the BBC. It has beencriticised for broadcasting the latest series of MasterChefwhich was filmed before its two presenters were sacked, and last month itadmitted that mistakes were made before and during a live Glastonbury broadcast of the punk duo Bob Vylanin which they chanted “death to the IDF”.Later in July an internal review found a BBC documentary about children in Gazabreached the corporation’s editorial guidelinesfor accuracy by failing to disclose its child narrator was the son of a Hamas official.Explore more on these topicsUK newsnewsShareReuse this content"

Video appeared to show a crew member confronting the band about the flag, which was draped on the stage, and then removing it. After calls from the band and the crowd of “free, free Palestine”, the sound was cut. The band briefly retrieved the flag to cheers.A representative for the festival initially said that the show was cut short after the band used “a chant which is widely understood to have a discriminatory context”.On Instagram, the Mary Wallopers disputed this, posting footage of the incident. “The festival have released a misleading statement to the press claiming they cut our sound because of a discriminatory chant and not the band’s call to Free Palestine. Our video clearly shows a Victorious crew member coming on stage, interfering with our show, removing the flag from the stage and then the sound being cut following a chant of ‘Free Palestine’. The same crew member is later heard in the video saying ‘you aren’t playing until the flag is removed’.“We completely reject Victorious’ portrayal of today’s events and request that they retract their statement immediately.”Victorious put out a subsequent statement apologising for the situation. “We are in the business of putting on great shows, not cutting them off and this is the last thing we wanted, for the band, their fans and ourselves. We didn’t handle the explanation of our policies sensitively or far enough in advance to allow a sensible conclusion to be reached. This put the band and our own team in a difficult situation which never should have arisen. We would like to sincerely apologise to all involved.“We absolutely support the right of artists to freely express their views from the stage, within the law and the inclusive nature of the event. Our policy of not allowing flags of any kind, which has been in place for many years for wider event management and safety reasons, is not meant to compromise that right.”The organisers accepted the band’s version of the events and said they would be making “a substantial donation to humanitarian relief efforts for the Palestinian people”.In response to the Mary Wallopers’ set being pulled, British band the Last Dinner Party cancelled their scheduled Saturday performance at the festival. “We are outraged by the decision made to silence the Mary Wallopers yesterday at Victorious,” they posted on Instagram. “As a band we cannot cosign political censorship and will therefore be boycotting the festival today.”‘People of all ages get very emotional at our gigs’: how ‘trad punk’ folk band the Mary Wallopers became a live sensationRead moreThe decision also drew condemnation from US bandVampire Weekend, who went ahead with their performance at Victorious on Saturday night. Frontman Ezra Koenig told the crowd: “If someone was punished for flying a flag, that is wrong and they deserve an apology. The terrible suffering of the Palestinian people deserves all of our sympathy.”Additionally this weekend, the BBC explained that it had “mutually agreed” with Reading and Leeds headliner Hozier ahead of the festivals that it would not broadcast his set. Onstage, the Irish musician called for a free Palestine and a “meaningful political solution for the kind of violence we’ve been seeing on our TV screens over the last two years – not lip service, but a meaningful peace process”.This article was amended on 25 August 2025 to reflect the Mary Wallopers’ full remarks.Explore more on these topicsMusicVampire WeekendThe Last Dinner PartynewsShareReuse this content"

Though he underwent emergency treatment at a hospital in nearby Memphis, Tennessee, Carroll died from his injuries.Southaven police said one man was arrested in connection with Carroll’s killing and had been jailed on one count of murder. The police later identified the arrested suspect as Tranell Marquise Williams, 38, the Memphis news stationWMCreported.Investigators had not discussed a possible motive in the standup comic’s slaying as of Monday morning, though they had made it a point to say it was “isolated”.The Memphis news station Fox13 reported Monday that a Burton Lane-based company that billed itself as the official site for merchandise of comedian Micah “Katt” Williams was evicted from its rented address in the wake of the shooting. A letter left at the company’s address – and addressed to multiple occupants including Tranell Williams – cited “criminal activity that occurred on or about the premises in violation of [its] lease agreement”, Fox13added.Fox13 said the letter went on to mention a shooting as well as an arrest made by Southaven police.The outlet reported that Carroll and Katt Williams, a fellow standup comic, had recently been on tour together.Carroll gained a following while performing in comedy clubs across the US, and word of his death had left that circuit in mourning.“Thank you for being one of the OGs who supported us early on,” Baltimore’s Mobtown Comedysaidon social media. “The Mobtown family and the Baltimore comedy community are very saddened by this loss of one of our city’s great talents. Sending our prayers to Reggie’s family.”On Instagram, Mo’Nique – who is from theBaltimorearea and won the 2010 best supporting actress Oscar for her performance in Precious – said she had “an amazing time being on tour together” previously with Carroll.“This is why I always say treat people the best you can because you never know if you’ll get a chance to see them again,” Mo’Nique said. “And the last time me and my brother Reggie, girl, was together – that’s what it was, an amazing time being on tour together, being on that road together, what a time, so I have no sad tears because all of our times together was amazing.”Among Carroll’s credits on the Internet Movie Database (IMDb) is an episode of The Parkers, a sitcom which starred Mo’Nique. As Deadlinenoted, he also appeared on the live variety series Showtime at the Apollo – and more recently he was in the 2023 standup special Knockout Kings of Comedy as well as in the 2022 television movie Rent & Go.Southaven police additionally offered condolences to Carroll’s loved ones, saying in a statement: “our thoughts [are] with [his] family.”The agency’s statement also thanked the public “for their patience and understanding” as the investigation into Carroll’s murder continued.Explore more on these topicsMississippiComedyUS crimeBaltimorenewsShareReuse this content"

Bassist Andy Rourkedied of pancreatic cancer in 2023without writing a memoir.Fans of the band will be hoping for insight into the 1996 high court case in which Joyce and Rourke suedMorrisseyand Marr over earnings: the frontman and guitarist took 40% of the royalties each, leaving 10% apiece for Joyce and Rourke.The rhythm section argued that they had been treated like session musicians despite being equal partners in the band. The court found in favour of Joyce, who received £1m in back royalties and a 25% share going forward, with the judge famously labelling Morrissey“truculent and unreliable”.There remains next to no chance of the Smiths re-forming. Marr has said he turned down an “eye-watering” fee to re-form: “It was a little bit about principles, but I’m not an idiot, I just think the vibe’s not right,” he said, a reference to the differences between him and Morrissey. Joyce has said that without Rourke, a reunion would be “impossible”.Joyce has recently been performing with Pete Doherty’s solo band.

How alone we are!–Hiba Abu NadaYou and I paint the shadowswe brought alonggive them colorshang them on the walls of waterto be washed offin the third century.In this week’s three-part poem, Michal Rubin mourns, and reimagines in a mysterious afterlife, the Palestinian author and activist,Hiba Abu Nada, who was killed in an Israeli airstrike on Gaza in 2023. The collection in which the poem appears was published in the spring of 2025 by Fomite Press, entitled“there are days that I am dead”. That bleak utterance (all words but “I” beginning in lower case on the book-jacket) reflects the acute pain of an Israeli writer experiencing the tension between her deep attachment to her country and its people, and her dismay at that country’s conduct in the war on Gaza.In her short preface, Rubin captures the impressionistic spirit of her collection as a “jagged painting portraying my inner world since 7 October …” Some of these war-framed poems take the form of diary-like day-by-day meditations. Others, like New Republic, are engagements with Palestinian poets and poems, seeking a vulnerable but navigable bridge between divided loyalties. The Poem of the Week floats the possibility of a “New Republic” via the tentatively optimistic allegory of two poets meeting together in a dream to collaborate on the painting of a kind of magical water-mural.As Rubin responds to three poems by Abu Nada (see below for sources and links), her emphasis is on finding direct, shareable language and emotion beyond “the second century / of world wars inside seas …” But a sea of sorrows must be entered by the two women before it becomes redemptive. In poem one of the trio, the two poets symbolise their respective countries, meeting to redefine their art together in “the sea of salt / where drowning is not possible”.Tears are suggested, of course, as is the Dead Sea, a salt lake bordered by Jordan to the east and the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Israel to the west. Rubin imagines that she and Abu Nada “sank to the bottom”, both having differently experienced the trauma of their nations. In the current terms of that broken politics, they should have been enemies, but the second poem marks their transition, politically free and mutually supportive (“We carried nothing / but each other”) to an act of creative, ethical nation-making.Rubin finds a powerful myth in Abu Nada’s line, “so carry nothing but love” and evokes more than children’s play when she claims that “in the deep sand // we built another castle …” The “castle” is a large and magical space for searching minds, rather than a sandcastle or fortress.After having “braided melancholy tunes / into unseen ceilings”, Rubin declares the women’s still transitional accomplishment: “You and I painted the shadows / we brought along // gave them colors / hung them on the walls of water …” Individual consciousness merges as the two poet-artists find an expression of their separate acts of witness. The ultimate vision, though, is that such picture-making will one day no longer be needed, “washed off / in the third century”.Rubin, whose grandparents were murdered in the Holocaust, lives in Columbia, South Carolina. Inspired by an alliance of peace-with-justice activists she met in Israel, she founded a group of Palestinian and American Jewish poets who regularly share work and ideas. Besides her poetry and peace commitments, she is a psychotherapist and cantor. Her most recent collection isAnd the Bones Stay Dry.I am grateful to Somaia Abu Nada for permission to publish the quotations from her sister’s poems. She paid loving tribute to her in anopen letterpublished in 2024. The quoted poems are translated into English by the Lebanese-American literary scholar Huda Fakhreddine. Each poem can be read in its entirety as follows: (1)I Grant You Refuge(2)Not Just Passing, and (3)Pull Yourself Together.Explore more on these topicsPoetryCarol Rumens's poem of the weekGazaMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinian territoriesIsraelfeaturesShareReuse this content"

One hair is “OK, acceptable”, more is evidence that she has been “having it off”, he says, unaware that he uses these delusions of her infidelity to protect himself from the dangers of intimacy. A high-flying Fulbright scholar becomes a sex worker to avenge the father she hates. An ex-nun discovers that her decades of religious seclusion were driven by an unconscious fear of pregnancy. A troubled young woman, seeking redress for her psychological losses, steals large sums of money that she will never spend.In Love’s Labour, the London-based, American-born psychoanalyst Stephen Grosz offers an antidote to the pat, sanitised love stories we absorb through romcoms, reality TV shows and other popular culture. Often, he writes, “easy stories obscure the hard ones”, and the hard ones are most true. “I like older guys”, the kleptomaniac tells him, an explanation that conceals: “I want a man to be the mother I never had.” In Grosz’s telling, psychoanalysis resembles a painstaking, collaborative act of excavation, removing layers of self-deception and motivated reasoning to discover the conflicting fears and desires that lie beneath.Love’s Labour is Grosz’s second book and like his bestselling 2013 debut, The Examined Life, it is a series of case studies that read like Grimms’ fairytales: dark and allegorical. His patients’ identifying details have been removed, but one imagines the pube-counting professor and others will recognise themselves. That these strange life stories are true(ish), makes them all the more powerful and compelling. The title refers to Grosz’s belief that the work of love is to learn to see oneself and others clearly – which is also the work of psychoanalysis and, arguably, of life.The book is as much about the mysteries of analysis as it about the mysteries of our hearts and sexual desires. In one chapter, Grosz recounts a fierce argument between two psychoanalysts after one, Susan, discovers that the other, Cora, has been having an affair with her husband. Susan says that Cora has never learned what psychoanalysis should be about: having empathy, behaving morally, accepting reality. But Cora believes the goal is learning to act according to one’s true desires and accept the consequences. Both outcomes, Grosz concludes, can be desirable consequences of analysis, but neither should be the aim of the therapist. To have aims for a patient is to infringe on their autonomy. He aims for nothing more than for his patients to better understand themselves.As one might expect, therapeutic breakthroughs often happen after Grosz and the patient analyse a dream, and his patients frequently trace the origins of their issues with intimacy to early childhood, to a dead or emotionally absent parent. Each case study can feel like a detective story: a tiny, inconsequential detail may, sometimes years later, unlock a new understanding. And what a long time this process can take! Grosz has been working with patients for 40 years, and sometimes a phone call or chance encounter decades after the initial consultation completely changes his understanding of a person’s predicament. In the penultimate chapter – a pure horror story: chilling, moving, unforgettable – he describes a sculptor who has found himself emotionally and physically stuck since his girlfriend’s suicide. After they have been speaking for 10 years, Tobias recounts a dream that finally enables him to reveal horrifying details about the aftermath of her death, details that help them both understand his emptiness, and that will haunt readers long after they have set this book aside.“To see the light, you have to go down into the dark,” Grosz writes. His patients often learn that pain or darkness cannot be avoided: to love fully one must accept the reality of loss, to live fully one must accept the reality of death. What a privilege it must be to accompany another person so closely as they try to figure out the challenge of living – of change and love, and accepting love and change. And what a privilege it is for the reader to catch a glimpse of this process.Love’s Labour by Stephen Grosz is published by Vintage (£18.99).

Weerasethakul depicts the fantastical in the same realist style he observes everyday life and his characters react to strangeness with zen acceptance. As with the logic of dreams, incomprehensible scenes make perfect emotional sense.This dream-like sensuality is strongly felt in his new work: A Conversation with the Sun (Afterimage), a monumental video installation at Sydney’s Museum of Contemporary Art. In the vast darkness of the museum’s Macgregor gallery, a random assortment of clips featuring quotidian imagery – palm fronds against the sky, a harbourside at night, Weerasethakul’s friends, including Swinton – play across a large screen while a curtain of floating white fabric moves slowly up and down in front of it. The cumulative effect of these image shards, layered and dissociated from narrative context, is the sensation of swimming through a sea of jumbled memories or dreams.View image in fullscreenApichatpong Weerasethakul says his work ‘plays with the audience’s awareness of illusion, of the material, of the space’.Photograph: Chayaporn ManeesuthamAs with all his work, Weerasethakul is reluctant to affix meaning – not only for viewers but also himself.“Over the years, I’m unconsciously drawn to certain objects or circular motifs, like sleep and dream,” he says. “I wasn’t really conscious about this until scholars and critics wrote about it. I was like, ‘Oh, am I like that?’ I intentionally try not to analyse or think about the work because I prefer something very spontaneous and organic.”A Conversation with the Sun (Afterimage), conceived with longtime collaborators Rueangrith Suntisuk and Pornpan Arayaveerasid, draws primarily on Weerasethakul’s 10-year-deep trove of video diaries, shot on a lo-res pocket camera that Weerasethakul calls his “particular eyes”. The camera’s sensitivity to light transformed what he saw; scenes of a wagging dog or a long walk through a garden often become overexposed or disintegrate into grainy irresolution. Intercut with Weerasethakul’s personal archive is Suntisuk and Arayaveerasid’s footage of Indonesian caves – a potent symbol: the site of humans’ first storytelling endeavours, in wall paintings and tales told around the flickering flames of communal fires.The movement of the curtain within the installation draws viewers’ attention to the delicacy of the images; it also calls attention to the projector beams, bringing us into keener awareness that light is a vessel for memory and illusion, and also an impermanent and changeable force.“His work gets us close to appreciating the things that as humans we do respond to – basic things like light, nature – in a way that you almost lose awareness that you’re actually viewing art,” says the work’s curator, Jane Devery. “It gets very close to the experience of being in front of something overwhelming and sublime in nature. I think that’s what people respond to, and I certainly do.”View image in fullscreenMindful, active watching is Weerasethakul’s goal.Photograph: Zan WimberleyWeerasethakul, sometimes referred to as a proponent of slow cinema, is known for his glacial pacing and wide, static frames. The elongated sense of time and lush compositions force the viewer to pay close attention to details we typically overlook – and, in the process, discover surprising marvels.A shift in the quality of light reveals the arrival of the ghost, or a complete transformation of identity. You may become entranced by the meditative thud of rainfall and a slow trek through an ancient cemetery, or you may fidget, waiting for answers to emerge, aware that you’re a restless body experiencing a complex illusion created by an artist.This kind of mindful, active watching is Weerasethakul’s goal: “[My work] plays with the audience’s awareness of illusion, of the material, of the space, too,” he says. “Even in my feature films, there are many moments where I like the audience to be aware that you are sitting with other people in the cave – a modern cave! It’s not like classic cinema where you lose yourself.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSaved for LaterFree newsletterCatch up on the fun stuff with Guardian Australia's culture and lifestyle rundown of pop culture, trends and tipsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The randomised images act as a Rorschach test of sorts, tapping into the profound mystery of our memories. Why does a particular shade of green remind us of childhood, or a hike we took one spring? Or why do I find the image of circular scribblings on notepaper, imposed over a slowly encroaching flame, profoundly unsettling?Each person, with their own unique wells of memory, will have a different experience in this collective space; Weerasethakul invites us to craft our own personal poetry.‘Fearless exploration’: visionary Australian artist Janet Dawson gets her first retrospective aged 90Read moreThis sense of freedom is crucial to Weerasethakul, whose film career has beendogged by Thailand’s censorship boardfrom the get-go, with his 2002 romance Blissfully Yours edited to remove graphic sex scenes. His visual arts practice has given him a way to work more freely.“It’s getting harder and harder to make personal cinema,” he says. “And when you are uncompromising, you have to wait years and years for funding. In between that time, this kind of practice has become very natural, like breathing.”Afterimage, the first installation Weerasethakul has created specifically for Australian audiences, offers an opportunity to experience one of the most distinctive imaginations in cinema.“I would just encourage people to see it for a long time,” Weerasethakul says. “Sit on the floor, walk around.

Revolving around the accession to the throne of elite warrior Ibanichuka (Patrick Diabuah), it touches on questions of political legitimacy, politics as the art of the possible, the proselytisation of west Africa by Christians and – that still-simmering hot potato – white colonialism.One minute Ibanichuka is on leave for overzealously butchering enslaved people, the next the goddess Tamunoba anoints him in a lake as Okrika’s saviour. Though ratified by the elders, he is still under general suspicion for his devotion to his wife, Mboro, (Monalisa Chinda Coker), who is unable to bear children, and for generally being a soft touch. He also has a monotheism problem: the local priest has switched sides to Christianity, desecrating his former idols, and chief Ogan (Nkem Owoh) is slyly pushing the lord’s agenda in Okrika – which may include free trade with the British.From Ibanichuka’s mirror-fronted headpiece on downwards, Amanyanabo: The Eagle King has an undeniable claim to being the best dressed epic of all time. But its exploration of the responsibilities of power, often couched in prolix dialogue, does get ponderous. Co-directors Fred Amata and Ibinabo Fiberesima promisingly set up the pincer pressures of Ibanichuka’s reign: the belligerent warrior culture testing his strength on one side, the Christians teeming like “unbridled chickens” on the other. But they lose their grip on the realism needed to underpin the hard-nosed subject matter; the cast often lapse into vaudevillian acting, and the rushed staging renders a pivotal assassination attempt scene more like a pub car park punch-up.Ibanichuka emerges as a “middle-way” candidate who tries to dispense benevolence equally. But, heavily focused on detailing a long series of internecine rivalries, the film falls short of fully digging into why his character runs to self-sacrificing extremes as he faces down a rapacious British consul (Lucien Morgan). All the same, the directors conjure up the glories of Okrika culture and handle large-scale bloodshed with brio; this is the kind of self-confident revisionist history that is good news for African cinema.Amanyanabo: The Eagle King is in UK cinemas from 29 August.Explore more on these topicsFilmPeriod and historical filmsDrama filmsNigeriaAfricareviewsShareReuse this content"

Based on the mobile game Hatsune Miku: Colorful Stage!, it features a barely characterised blur of wannabe musicians and actors who ascribe Manhattan Project importance to writing syrupy J-pop. As they interact with virtual counterparts in metaverses called “Sekai” created from users’ emotions, the film is like The Matrix if Neo had huffed a nitrous oxide canister before having every edition of Pop Idol downloaded into his cranium.One of the virtual pop stars, a rogue version of Hatsune Miku (voiced by Saki Fuijta), keeps invading high-school kids’ mobile phones and flatscreens, begging for help. Apparently issuing from a Sekai created by the emo angst of everyone about to give up on their creative ambitions, she is hoping to connect with these lost souls. So Miku taps this creative hive mind about how better to refine the ditty she believes can unite the world – while the seething mass of negativity in her home dimension swells to apocalyptic proportions.Amid interchangeably candy-haired popsters screaming hysterically, the opening to Colorful Stage! has precious little to grasp hold of. None of the characters are given any weight, other than the introspective Ichika (Ruriko Noguchi), whose vaguely implied past disappointments mean Miku is drawn to her. With the franchise’s five pop groups not even named as they decide to put on a show, the film just leaves a blanket impression of ultra-pious self-empowerment and aspiration. Characters make such heroic exhortations as: “We should probably put more work into our socials than we usually do.”More’s the pity, as the animation is absolutely top-drawer. The lollipop-headed, tendril-headed popsters are lushly drawn, and director Hiroyuki Hata is particularly gifted at using light to lift scenes with an Elysian glow. The climactic gig, is as dynamic and even more psychedelic than professional concert films. But this garbled, chronically online film is clearly targeted at the TikTok generation, and might just be the future of film-making after all.Colorful Stage!

The Delacorte, an open-air amphitheater in Central Park, paused its annual outdoor series of high-profile and free summer shows in 2024 to continue with a renovation, and now returns, refurbished – and temporarily restocked with a bunch of familiar faces. For their production of William Shakespeare’s Twelfth Night, the Public Theater has snagged Peter Dinklage, Sandra Oh, Jesse Tyler Ferguson, Daphne Rubin-Vega, singer/actor Moses Sumney, and Lupita Nyong’o in the central role of Viola, opposite her real-life brother Junior as Viola’s twin Sebastian.Inflexible autocrat, unchecked power – Coriolanus is ‘never not timely’. So why is this Shakespeare play so rarely staged?Read moreThe Nyong’o siblings and director Saheem Ali all grew up in Nairobi, Kenya, and there are snatches of Swahili dialogue from Viola and Sebastian, separated via shipwreck as the play opens. Viola washes ashore on the coast of Illyria, afraid that Sebastian may be dead. She disguises herself as a man called Cesario and takes a job serving Duke Orsino (Khris Davis), who uses Cesario to send messages to Olivia (Oh), who he loves. Olivia falls in love with Cesario/Viola, who falls in love with Orsino, who still pines for Olivia. Olivia also figures into a comic subplot, where Sir Toby (John Ellison Conlee) and his sidekick Andrew (Ferguson), hedonists both, play a vengeful trick on Malvolio (Dinklage) for spoiling their fun. They convince Malvolio that Olivia loves him, sending him on a mission to seduce her, which prompts her to think him mad. Sebastian turns up, too, though his role is secondary. This is a somewhat abbreviated production, cut down to under two hours, no intermission and not a lot of breathing room.Returning to that Swahili dialogue: it provides lovely grace notes, and some genuine moments of pure acting for an audience that may not know the play nor the language by heart (or at all). It also underlines, presumably unintentionally, the sameness of some of the show’s other performances. Everyone in it is quite funny and charming; the cast also tends to goose laughs by juxtaposing modern emphases and gestures with the Elizabethan verse. This helps bring some of the meaning across in a playful way, and garners plenty of big laughs. It also sometimes wears thin despite the variety of characters and actors the show employs.It’s probably no accident that the cast members who most stand out are on opposite poles from this energized but generic approach. Nyong’o has plenty of comic moments where her Viola-as-Cesario must perform a cartoonish version of masculinity, perhaps not so much less restrained than Orsino’s preening “real” version, backed up by a crew of macho yes-men. (In one of the better physical running gags, a stern look from Orsino sends one of them into repeated, punitive push-ups.) But she has room, too, for quieter moments of real sincerity, and sells a love story with Orsino that, in this telling at least, would otherwise feel barely-there. She anchors a production that otherwise prioritizes shtick and showmanship.Dinklage, meanwhile, goes further into full-bodied comedy than his co-stars, who are already plenty committed. He does a terrifically inventive job turning Malvolio’s officiousness – the quality that so irritates Sir Toby and Andrew – into a precise form of romantic delirium. While some of the other players give their deliveries some modern punctuation, Dinklage is doing something bolder and more dexterous with his physicality and his distinctive voice. Malvolio’s pompousness takes on a kind of deranged purity; he may have broken up other characters’ revelry, but he’s willing to give his full, hilariously annoying self to Olivia. His subsequent imprisonment later in the show has more pathos than most (all?) of the romantic entanglements; Dinklage is simply a joy to watch.He and Nyong’o aren’t the only joy in the show; when they’re both offstage, there’s plenty more entertainment from the talented cast and in the show’s outdoor crispness. But Ali seems to emphasize the fun ofTwelfth Nightrather than complicate or fully interrogate it (despite one role, Sebastian’s faithful friend Antonio, given a more romantic subtext by the non-binary performer, b). A few bits and pieces of scenic design appear and recede elegantly from below the stage, but the permanent set is just the letters spelling out WHAT YOU WILL – the play’s subtitle – at the rear of the stage, subject to a few funny sight gags but mostly bringing to mind the Robert Indiana “LOVE” statue (or an Instagram station). The grand finale features an explosion of eye-filling costume design, but what does it have to do with the rest of the show, beyond the underdeveloped moments of gender performance?Then again, maybe it’s appropriate that Shakespeare returns to Central Park with a reminder that his work can be delightful fun, especially with a play that does refer to its own stage-friendly qualities. “If this were play’d upon a stage now,” the character Fabian remarks at one point, “I could condemn it as an improbable fiction.” It would be hard to do that for this Twelfth Night. Nitpick, maybe, but not condemn; it’s entirely probable that the crowds bearing their hard-won tickets will have a great time.Explore more on these topicsStageLupita Nyong'oPeter DinklageTwelfth NightUS theaterTheatreWilliam ShakespearereviewsShareReuse this content"

If you don’t give the board that headache, they don’t care what you do. The miracle was that this thriftily run organisation won a reputation for extravagant, beautifully costumed productions in a repertoire that included the plays of Tennessee Williams, John Webster and the Jacobeans (a Prowse speciality), Brecht, Pirandello, Goldoni, Karl Kraus, Lermontov, Goethe and even Proust. Remembrance of Things Past was translated by MacDonald in 1980 as A Waste of Time, telling Proust’s story backwards over four hours on a stage of gilded frames. Havergal played Baron de Charlus with debonair, sinister panache.The tone of outlandish provocation was set with a 1970 all-male production of Hamlet, with nudity, copulation, reams of black satin, over-pitched, screeching delivery and a rock-star lead performance by David Hayman that drove the Scotsman critic on to the front page in horror and led to the cancellation of school party bookings; the kids came along anyway, and the place was packed.View image in fullscreenGiles Havergal leading rehearsals of the Glasgow Citizens company in the 1980s.Photograph: colaimages/AlamyThe seats were 50p – a huge banner declared as much across the front entrance – in a theatre where all actors had an equal wage, there was no billing, a free programme and a tone of creative bravado. The philosophy was, said Havergal, that if nobody liked what we do, we were free to do what we liked.This was in a city where Brecht was box office and all the political squabbles – the lord provost, who never went near the place, said that he did not have to go down a sewer to know that it stank – were defused thanks to the charm and public relations skills of Havergal and his supportive chairman, Bill Taylor, and, it must be said, the unwavering support of the Guardian criticCordelia Oliver.It helped that Havergal, Prowse and MacDonald, who took all the auditions, had such finely tuned noses for talent. The stream of superb young actors who started out with them included Mark Rylance, Pierce Brosnan, Celia Imrie, Patricia Quinn, Ann Mitchell,Alan Rickman, Greg Hicks, Rupert Frazer, Jonathan Hyde,Roberta Taylor, Gerard Murphy, Ciarán Hinds, Siân Thomas, Gary Oldman and Rupert Everett.Havergal managed to establish so flagrantly daring a theatre in the community at large with hisTheatreAbout Glasgow schools programme, a policy of free previews, and a warm welcome to other Scottish companies over the summer months.When not appearing on the stage himself – his most memorable performances included Old Lady Squeamish in Wycherley’s The Country Wife in 1977 and a solo Death in Venice (as the writer Von Aschenbach) in 2000, which he performed later all over the world – he was in the foyer, every night, welcoming the audience generally and often individually.He was a tall, genial presence, aquiline-featured, dressed in black, a brilliant communicator who really did believe the show started when the audience first stepped into the theatre. When Glasgow was European city of culture in 1990,Glenda Jackson– who had played an unforgettable Phedra for Prowse and McDonald at the Citizens and Old Vic in 1984 – gave a gut-wrenching, raucous Mother Courage. “It’s a very special theatre,” she said, “in a very special city.”View image in fullscreenGlenda Jackson, right, as Mother Courage and Jane Bertish as Kattrin in the Glasgow Citizens production of Mother Courage at the Mermaid theatre, 1990.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianHavergal was born in Edinburgh, the second son of Henry Havergal, choirmaster, and principal of the Royal Academy of music and drama in Glasgow, and his wife, Margaret (nee Chitty). He was educated at Harrow school in north London, and Christ Church, Oxford, where he made a lifelong friend of the writer Ferdinand Mount.His first job, in 1961, was as an assistant stage manager in Carlisle, followed by stints at the Oldham Coliseum and Barrow. He was appointed artistic director of the Watford Palace in 1966, where he directed the British premiere of Tennessee Williams’s Sweet Bird of Youth starring Vivien Merchant in 1968.That opening Hamlet featured 18 actors of an average age of 22 years. The policy of “famous plays in interesting ways” with no thought of a transfer to the West End or anywhere else was adhered to throughout, except for an unsuccessful transplant of Molière’s Don Juan to the Roundhouse and the two hit Jackson shows moving to the Old Vic and the Mermaid.Even in the anarchic 1970s, no other theatre presented something as astonishing as the De Sade Show (1976), whose literary sources included 120 Days of Sodom, the novels Justine and Juliette, and a social/narrative binding derived by MacDonald from the master/servant comedies of Marivaux.View image in fullscreenRupert Everett in the Citizens production of The Vortex at the Garrick Theatre, London, 1989.Photograph: Donald Cooper/AlamyThen there was MacDonald’s Chinchilla (1977), which also visited the Edinburgh festival, a charged meditation on the Venice Lido of Diaghilev replacing Nijinsky in his personal and professional affections with Massine, and expressing what sounded like a manifesto of Havergal’s theatre: “passion for reform, passion for power, passion for beauty, a thirst to show, a lust to tell, a rage to love”.In the 1980s, a Genet retrospective incorporated the Victorian boxes of the theatre itself into the stage design; Coward’s The Vortex, with Everett and Maria Aitken, offered a pathology of addiction and implied a perennial decadence as well as an absolute modernity; and a budgetary crisis (not the first) impelled Havergal to adapt Graham Greene’s Travels with My Aunt as a play for four male actors in grey suits and maroon V-necked sweaters.Travels was a big hit and three years later was remounted in the West End, where it won an Olivier award in 1993. Havergal himself was in the cast, all of whom were versions of the protagonist Henry Pulling, all assuming the other characters without costume changes, Havergal as a suitably imperious Aunt Augusta. As a third-person narrative, in the style of the Shared Experience company, it was simple, and it was brilliant.View image in fullscreenGiles Havergal in Death in Venice at the Citizens’ theatre, Glasgow, 2000.Photograph: Alan Wylie/AlamyIn the early 1990s, two smaller studios, one at the back of the stalls, the other on the side of the circle, were added, but all three Citizens spaces were imaginatively programmed, no soft options. So, Death in Venice played alongside Prowse’s revelatory, unsentimental take on Coward’s Cavalcade in the big auditorium in 1999; while, in 2003, a fresh look at a genuinely good thriller, Dial M for Murder, jostled alongside a steamy, gorgeous new studio version of Colette’sChéri.The seat prices had risen by now to £12, with £4 concessions, and the still free previews. Havergal had overseen a drastic front-of-house refurbishment, a wonderful new foyer and improved facilities while retaining the style, atmosphere and statuary of the 1878 original.Outside of the Citizens, Havergal had rediscovered a Scottish classic, Ena Lamont Stewart’s Men Should Weep, for the 7:84 theatre group in 1982 and adapted (with another Citizens alumnus, Fidelis Morgan), for Shared Experience, Samuel Richardson’s 18th-century epistolary novel Pamela, as well as Elizabeth Bowen’s masterpiece The Heat of the Day in 1987, two years before theHarold Pintertelevision film appeared.View image in fullscreenIain Mitchell, Jonathan Hyde, Gregory Gudgeon and David Bamber in Havergal’s adaptation of Travels with My Aunt directed by Christopher Luscombe at the Menier Chocolate Factory in London, 2013.Photograph: Elliott Franks/eyevineOver the past two decades, he remained busy in opera, working for Opera North, Minnesota Opera, the Opera Theatre of St Louis and Scottish Opera, and maintained until the end of his life a creative relationship with the American Conservatory theatre of San Francisco – teaching, lecturing and directing. He never lost, he said, the excitement or stimulation of entering the rehearsal room with a crowd of young, enthusiastic actors.Havergal lived for many years in Sauchiehall Street in Glasgow and Battersea in London, moving in recent years to a tidy terraced house near Clapham Common, where he kept a beautiful small garden. He remained an insatiable theatregoer, serving for some years on the board of the Almeida theatre in Islington, north London.He was made OBE in 1987 and CBE in 2002 and held honorary doctorates at the universities of Glasgow and Strathclyde, and the Scottish academy of music and drama where his father had been principal.Havergal’s older brother, Malcolm, predeceased him. He is survived by a niece, Louise.Giles Pollock Havergal, director and actor, born 9 June 1938; died 23 August 2025Explore more on these topicsTheatreGlasgowScotlandobituariesShareReuse this content"

With fewer than 1,500 people, theLake Districtevent – created and curated by the art-rock outfit Sea Power – is intimate almost to the point of being familial.

This is something that Stewart Lee jokes about during a brief and expertly executed standup set the following day, while characterising the audience, with affection, as a bunch of “sandal-wearing” indie-folkers. Sea Power put in a herculean effort to play their third gig of the weekend on Sunday, despite some members being up until eight o’clock that morning, resulting in a chill and woozy set that feels custom-built for fragile brains.‘The music industry is smoke and mirrors’: how DIY duo the Lovely Eggs are keeping the north weirdRead moreWhile Krankenhaus is endearingly back to basics, it’s also deceptively vast. Steam train trips and guided walks in sublime mountainous settings open up its cosiness into even more beautiful terrain. While so many festivals feel like the equivalent of an airport experience – trapped in a space and rinsed for all you’ve got while stuck there – Krankenhaus really leans into its location and encourages festival-goers to do the same. It’s genuinely unique.Explore more on these topicsMusicMusic festivalsFestivalsSea PowerPop and rockLake Districtlive music reviewsShareReuse this content"

While British seaside resorts are struggling amid tough competition from cheap overseas holidays, the lights remain, he said, “an incredibly strong part of people’s leisure heritage”.“The British seaside does have an extraordinary place in everybody’s holiday legacy,” he said. “And this is something that we really focus on with the Blackpool experience.“Come here and remember what it was like when you were your children’s age,” he added. “Come with your parents, come with your grandparents, use this as a way of coming together.”View image in fullscreenBlackpool in 1954.Photograph: Mirrorpix/Getty ImagesHowever, Llewelyn-Bowen said, while the illuminations have formed core memories for generations of children in the north-west in particular, the appeal of the lights has not spread widely beyond the Midlands; “It is a bit of a north-south divide,” he said.“You get to a point where suddenly you just say ‘Blackpool’, and everyone starts getting rather misty-eyed,” he said, “and that carries on as far north as you can go, because it’s always been incredibly popular with the Scots as well.“I always feel rather sorry for the poor mealy mouthed, magnolia-shaded Farrow and Ball-obsessed south,” he added. “Because they never really will get that, they will be kind of quite Brighton-centric, because somehow it’s cool, but actually, there’s nothing cooler than Blackpool, and nothing naughtier as well.”Growing up in London, Llewelyn-Bowen said he himself was a latecomer to the illuminations. “I have no vestigial nostalgia for Blackpool,” he said. “Blackpool was never part of my childhood experience at all.”The radical plan for a futuristic age-friendly neighbourhood in ManchesterRead moreHowever, he said, “it very quickly became part of my children’s childhood … and of course, a big thing now is that my grandchildren are obsessed by this whole thing. So I love the fact that it’s a contagion, that I kind of started myself.”Thanks to his involvement with the illuminations, Llewelyn-Bowen is one of Blackpool’s fiercest advocates, but he was taken by the town even on his first visit, on a very wet November afternoon in the mid-1980s, when he was working for a flooring company, and sent up to the Winter Gardens.“I just didn’t know that somewhere like this existed in the United Kingdom, somewhere where everywhere you looked there was so much design,” he said. “To me, it was like a jacked version of Portmeirion, but in such an incredibly kind of opulent, ornate way.“I mean, Brighton’s got bits of embellishment, everywhere you go in Britain’s seaside-scape, you’ll find some curly, twirly piers, but Blackpool, literally you cannot spit without hitting a furbelow,” he added.“I’ve always just felt that it is in such an incredibly stiff-upper-lip, strait-laced architectural nation, Blackpool is literally the only place, I think, where design really gets to take its bra off in this country, and really just do it for the shits and giggles.”Explore more on these topicsBlackpoolLancashireDesignEnglandfeaturesShareReuse this content"

She spent most of her life inCumbria, where she was an active member of the community in Keswick.She was a talented painter, though she never wanted to sell her work, but did occasionally give pieces away to friends. In the mid-1950s she had trained at BarrowArtSchool, where she became part of a small group of painters and potters who stayed connected well into their 80s and beyond.Freda was born in Kendal, to Laura Brand, but never knew her father, and was brought up by her single mother with practical and financial help from her uncle, William Brand, in Barrow-in-Furness, where she went to Barrow grammar school. It was William, a fitter at the local shipyard, who helped to nurture Freda’s artistic skills. Beginning at Barrow Art School in 1955, she met Geoff Hayes, a fellow student, and they married in 1959, moving to Hampshire, where they both then worked as art teachers.When their two daughters, Sophie and me, were born in the mid-60s, Freda left teaching to look after the family, and they moved back north to the town of Brampton in Cumbria, where Geoff taught at Harraby school in Carlisle.In 1968 the family moved to Keswick, and Freda and Geoff found a community in which they would spend the next 60 years of their lives. She worked at various Keswick schools as a teaching assistant and also ran private drawing classes in her house.In the mid-70s Freda and a friend, Lyn Denny, opened an Oxfam shop in Keswick after taking a course. Later, for a year or so, she ran a weekly market stall in the town selling her own screenprinted tote bags.A socialist, Guardian reader, and member of CND and Cumbrians for Peace, she was also was active in the Keswick theatre club for more than 40 years.She was was an incredibly creative individual, always sewing, painting, holding art classes and encouraging others to learn to draw and paint.Geoff died in 2024. Freda is survived by Sophie and me, and six grandchildren, Harry, Flora, Milo, Anna, Finn and Jerry.Explore more on these topicsArtOther livesLake DistrictCumbriaTeachingobituariesShareReuse this content"

There are many people with the time and resources seeking an experience, and Italy, with its long coastline and beautiful landscapes beyond the big cities, provides the perfect package.”After lunch on board curated by a three-star Michelin chef, we stop at Taormina to explore its ancient Greek theatreAt Palermo station, we were greeted by Stefano Sgambellone, the Dolce Vita’s train manager, and his team of impeccably dressed staff.“In 1883, the Orient Express became the first way to travel slowly, in luxury,” said Sgambellone, who for years worked for Venice Simplon-Orient-Express (VSOE), a luxury rail service with a range of European routes. “Today, slow travel is even more popular than it was then.”While the focus of VSOE is primarily the onboard experience, the Dolce Vita itinerary also includes off-board jaunts and experiences across its 10 Italy-only itineraries, such as learning to cook a local dish, exploring off-the-beaten-track medieval towns and dining in a private Venetian home.“People are choosing the Dolce Vita not only for the train itself, which is beautiful, but because it’s the best way to discover Italy,” said Sgambellone.View image in fullscreenA deluxe train cabin designed by Milan-based DimorestudioThe train’s whistle blew at 10.30am, and we departed Palermo.

There was the US author, the Italian ambassador and the Parisian couple who are seasoned long-distance train travellers.View image in fullscreenLa Dolce Vita Lounge at Roma stationIt was also the first time that Britt Moran and Emiliano Salci, the architects from the Milan-based Dimorestudio who designed Dolce’s 1960s-inspired cabins, restaurant and bar, had travelled on the train.“Obviously we had seen it before,” said Moran, “but in terms of the whole experience: wow, this is so nice!”After a night onboard in Sicily, the carriages were loaded on to a privately chartered ferry for the 30-minute crossing to the mainland. From there, the train headed up the coast of Calabria and towards Maratea, where it made another afternoon stop, before departing for Rome in the evening.When the Dolce Vita arrived at Ostiense station the next morning, all the passengers appeared to be satisfied. While they boarded the train as strangers, running the risk of animosity in such a confined space for two days, they disembarked as friends.The trip was provided byLa Dolce Vita Orient Express; the three-day/two-night From Sicilyto Rome trip starts at €11,280per person(From Rome to Sicily starts at €9,440)Explore more on these topicsItaly holidaysRail travelEurope holidaysRail industryPublic transport tripsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

One night, I started making a caesar salad, then wondered what would happen if I made a coriander-pesto mayonnaise and mugged off the anchovies in favour of chorizo. Then I thought about turning it into a full meal, at which point it stopped being anything like a caesar salad. If you’d prefer a vegetarian version, choose a vegetarian parmesan and omit the chorizo in favour of a heaped teaspoon of smoked paprika and a scant teaspoon of sea salt flakes.Crispy butter bean, chorizo and cos salad with corianderPrep15 minCook25 minServes250ml olive oil, plus 1 tbsp for roasting100g chorizo, cut into 1cm chunks400g tin butter beans, drained and rinsed well150g Tenderstem broccoli, cut into 1cm pieces50g fresh coriander, leaves and stems20g parmesan, or vegetarian parmesan25g pumpkin seeds1 egg yolkJuice of ½ lemon1tsp salt2little gem lettuce, roughly shreddedHeat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6. Put a tablespoon of olive oil, the chorizo and drained butter beans in a shallow baking tray and mix well. Roast for 20-25 minutes, until the beans start to crisp up nicely.Meanwhile, blanch the Tenderstem in a bowl of just-boiled water for two minutes, then drain well.For the dressing, put the coriander, parmesan, pumpkin seeds, 50ml olive oil, egg yolk, lemon juice and salt in a high-speed blender and blitz to a smoothish, pale green sauce: it should be almost as thick as mayonnaise, but with a little more texture. Taste and adjust the salt and lemon as needed.Just before you want to eat, tip the shredded lettuce into a large bowl and add the broccoli. Dress with a third of the dressing, then divide between two plates. Dot over the remaining dressing, scatter the butter bean and chorizo mix on top, and serve immediately.Explore more on these topicsSaladQuick and easyBeans, pulses and legumesFoodMain courseSpanish food and drinkVegetablesSausagesrecipesShareReuse this content"
