It’s unpopular enough playing the antagonist who murders a long-running TV character. When your victim is a fan favourite, though, you risk being vilified even more. So what’s it like being the ultimate baddy and breaking viewers’ hearts? Do they get booed in the street or trolled online? We asked five actors who killed off beloved characters – from Spooks toThe Sopranos, Wolf Hall to Westeros – about their experiences …‘After the Red Wedding, people walked away from me backwards’Michael McElhatton played Roose Bolton, who stabbed Robb Stark in the infamous Red Wedding episode of Game of ThronesView image in fullscreenKnife and death … Richard Madden as Robb Stark and Michael McElhatton as Roose Bolton in Game of Thrones.Photograph: Helen Sloan/HBO“It was 13 years ago but I vividly remember filming the Red Wedding. How could you not? We shot it over five days, all blocked out like a play, which never happens in film or TV. Three major characters got killed: Talisa (Oona Chaplin), Robb (Richard Madden) and Catelyn (Michelle Fairley). It’s a huge turning point and where Game of Thrones truly took off. In fact, that was the part of the books that convinced David Benioff and DB Weiss to acquire the TV rights. They said ‘As long as they don’t cancel us before the Red Wedding, we’re fine!’I was in the makeup trailer next to this guy who was dressed as a lowly serf. As we walked to the set, I introduced myself and he said: ‘I’m Will, I’m playing one of the musicians.’ I figured he was a specialist in Elizabethan instruments or something. I said: ‘Are you a musician in real life? Are you in a band? Having any luck?’ He said, ‘We’re doing all right.’ ‘What are you called?’ ‘Coldplay.’ I went: ‘Oh god!’ It was Will Champion, the drummer. I spent the next four days trying to ingratiate myself.It’s magnificent TV. Catelyn notices the door being locked. The music changes. Then she realises I’m wearing chainmail under my shirt and all hell kicks off. I stab Robb in the heart but they did that digitally. I just had the handle of a dagger in my hand. I was right up in Richard’s face, watching him die. Brutal. There’s a great meme of me doing it with Trump.I snarl ‘The Lannisters send their regards’ and had no idea it would become a standout quote. It’s on T-shirts, tote bags, all sorts. I wish I got royalties but it’sGeorge RR Martin’s line. A friend was in LA and a driver had run into the back of another car. There was a huge dent and they’d written in it ‘The Lannisters send their regards.’ I was tickled by that.When the episode aired, my phone lit up with messages saying: ‘What have you done?’ I was doing a play in London and saw an entire tube carriage where every passenger was reading a free newspaper with four pages of graphic Red Wedding photos inside. I stood by the train door, pulling my baseball cap down. I hadn’t appreciated the enormity of it as a cultural moment until then. People didn’t treat me differently but they did tend to walk away backwards!”‘Shooting Adriana was my hardest scene ever’MusicianSteven Van Zandt played Silvio Dante, who whacked mob wifeAdriana La Cervain the woods inseason five of The SopranosView image in fullscreenHit episode … Drea de Matteo as Adriana La Cervaand Steven Van Zandt as Silvio Dante in The Sopranos.Photograph: HBO“The way I got the role is ridiculous. [Sopranos creator] David Chase was a fan of our music, saw me make a speech at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and offered me a part. I said: ‘I’d feel guilty taking an actor’s job.’ He said: ‘That’s OK, I’ll write a new character for you.’ Casting me was a ballsy move. David handed me a gift by making me an actor. It changed my career.My whole life had been research. I’d read every mob book, seen every gangster movie and grew up around scary guys in our neighbourhood. I wrote a backstory for Silv and made him nostalgic for the good old days when guys didn’t rat each other out. That’s why he had that 50s hairstyle. I wasn’t originally meant to be Tony Soprano’s consigliere but the writers picked up on my relationship with [actor] Jimmy Gandolfini and made me underboss. I knew that dynamic well because I had a similar relationship with Bruce [Springsteen] in the E Street Band. His trusted right-hand man.Silvio had ascended to executive level and was only brought in for special hits. That was the case with Adriana. It was the hardest scene I’ve ever done. My whole life’s been dedicated to stopping bullies. That’s why I took on the South African government [founding Artists United Against Apartheid]. Putting my hands on a woman and roughing her up was difficult. Any violence towards women is repulsive to me. But Drea [de Matteo, who played Adriana] said: ‘This is my last scene, let’s make it a good one. Don’t go easy on me.’ Afterwards, we lay down in the leaves and I said: ‘You just won your first Emmy.’ And she did.Knocking off regulars were the hardest days on set. It was normally a wonderful atmosphere but suddenly people were bickering and uptight. It was the same when we killed Vinny Pastore [who played Big Pussy] on the boat. Those were the two most emotional days in the whole eight years. To be respectful, we don’t show the moment of Adriana’s death, you just hear gunshots. It sparked conspiracy theories about whether he’d really killed her. Jay Leno asked me on his talkshow. I said: ‘What do you think I was doing in the woods, shooting squirrels?’Just to show how sick the world is, after the episode aired, a few people came up and said: ‘Good job, man, she deserved that.’ I’d be like: ‘What’s the matter with you? She was a perfectly innocent girl.’ But for every one of those, hundreds more were heartbroken. Eventually justice was done and Silvio himself got shot. I didn’t want to die, so David left me in a coma as a compromise. I would have survived for a sequel, trust me! Even today in meetings, I wish I was Silvio. I’d get a lot more done!”‘It was like a western on the streets of Belfast’Art Campion played gangster Sully,who gunned downPC Gerry Cliffin the debut series ofBelfast police drama Blue LightsView image in fullscreenBang, bang … Art Campion as Sully in Blue Lights.Photograph: Steffan Hill/BBC“The shootout was like a western. We cordoned off a whole street and had weapons training. I’ve been around a few guns for gigs and the blast off a blank is powerful. I’m very aware of how lethal they can be. If you put a blank in front of an orange, it’ll explode. An armourer would pop in between takes, show me the barrel and we’d be good to go.I wore squibs under my hoodie, so when Sully shot Gerry [played by Richard Dormer], then got gunned down by Jen [fellow officer, played by Hannah McClean], she fired in a certain rhythm – bang-bang, bang-bang, bang – which put me down against a lamppost. It’s handy because you can feel the squibs going off and it helps you jolt. I deliberately didn’t place my head very well, to make it look realistically clumsy but ended up lying there quite a while, regretting that. I was moving house at the time and remember lying in a pool of blood, haggling on the phone with a builder.View image in fullscreenWrong place, wrong time … Richard Dormer as Gerry Cliff in Blue Lights.Photograph: Steffan Hill/BBCI’d just played Father Peter in Derry Girls, so it was nice to show people that I’m not only a priest with existential doubts. I can also be a cocaine-sniffing, gun-toting lunatic! Viewers had got attached to Gerry. He was the heart of the show, a lovable character, so they were genuinely affected by his death. That’s what good dramas do.

I went all in with the Russian accent and had this Justin Bieber-esque hairstyle. As they cut it in, I went: ‘He doesn’t look very dangerous.’ They were like: ‘That’s why it’ll be a surprise when Sasha does what he does.’ It was quite intimidating coming into a close-knit cast and crew but Nicola Walker was so welcoming, any sense of guilt about killing her immediately evaporated. She made light of it all and was the perfect castmate to kill!The stabbing had a tragic happenstance to it. It wasn’t premeditated, it was almost a crime of passion. It felt like a shock twist, which made it all the more effective. I stabbed her with a shard of broken glass, which was fake – made of plastic. I was trying to kill Harry [Pearce, played by Peter Firth] but Ruth got in the way and bled out from her belly. Who knows how fans would have responded if I’d got Harry instead? Imagine if it had been both of them! I probably wouldn’t be here today. Meanwhile, my character gets shot in the leg and carted off. My father was convinced I got shot in the arse, which amused him.View image in fullscreen‘If you make millions of viewers cry, you’ve done the job right’ … Nicola Walker as Ruth Evershed in Spooks.Photograph: Amanda Searle/BBC/KudosEveryone came down to the location, even people who weren’t working that day, just to be there for the goodbye. It felt very special. The tears were genuine from a lot of people. There was a real sense of an ending. Ruth and Harry had this semi-platonic love story for nine series and I ruined it. Fans clung to the hope that she wasn’t really dead. People would say: ‘That’s not it, though, is it? Surely that’s not the end?’People on the tube shook their fists at me. I joined Twitter a few years later and people messaged me saying: ‘You know what you did!’ They were cross but in a tongue-in-cheek way. Every so often, people still say: ‘You’re the one who killed Ruth.’ If you make millions of viewers cry, you’ve done the job right. Long may it continue. Perhaps they’ll be blaming me for the rest of my life.”‘Everyone looked worried. Just as well Claire Foy was blindfolded’Philippe Spall played the Calais Executioner,who beheadedAnne Boleynat the climax of series one of period drama Wolf HallView image in fullscreenNo mercy … Claire Foy as Anne Boleyn and Philippe Spall as the Calais Executioner in Wolf Hall.Photograph: BBC“I’m half-French, so when Wolf Hall needed a Calais swordsman, I was called in to meet director Peter Kosminsky. It was written in Hilary Mantel’s novel that Anne Boleyn’s executioner was almost balletic. They wanted a swift, merciful death. The fight director showed me medieval woodcuts of him in these flamenco-like poses. There’s theatricality to it – unlike poor old Thomas More, who just got his head lopped off with an axe.We shot the beheading at Dover Castle, which stood in for the Tower 0f London, in mid-July. You’d expect it to be lovely and sunny but the gods went: ‘We’re not having that.’ It suddenly turned into this dull day with wind whistling around the courtyard, which added to the spooky atmosphere. The weapon was extraordinary – a huge sword, handmade for the show, as close to the original specifications as they could. It was ridiculously heavy. Afterwards, they went: ‘Maybe we should have done it in aluminium?’ I trained out the back of my house with a scaffolding pole to get used to its weight. I remember my neighbours going: “All right there, Phil? Just practising?”Swinging it at Claire Foy became an interesting exercise. For the first few takes, they said: ‘Stop your swing at the top of the arc,’ but the director of photography said: ‘No, he needs to swing it near her head.’ Everyone looked worried but we got something that looked very realistic. Probably just as well that Claire was blindfolded, so she didn’t realise quite how close I was getting.I slip off my shoes, so she won’t hear me coming. Another period detail was that the headsman stands to one side and says ‘Apportez l’épée’ (‘Bring me the sword’). Anne speaks French, so she snaps her head round, exposing the tendons in her neck for a clean cut. I dance across to the other side and swing. The prosthetic head was fitted with a pump, so fake blood gushed out of the severed neck over Anne’s maids. They wrap up the head and carry off the body because they don’t want the men to touch her.I was lucky that in the sequel,The Mirror and the Light, I haunt Thomas Cromwell’s nightmares. They used old footage but it’s great to pop up in both series. It’s not the only royal TV death I’ve been involved in. A few years later, I was the Parisian dogwalker inThe Crownwho calls 999 when Diana’s car crashes. Royalty, death, French – that seems to have become my niche!”Explore more on these topicsTelevisionSpooksGame of ThronesWolf HallBlue LightsThe SopranosDramafeaturesShareReuse this content"

How does one build those into a political system?Fri 21 Nov 2025 13.05 ESTLast modified on Fri 21 Nov 2025 19.23 ESTShareIt feels as though a collective amnesia has set in around Covid-19. We all just want to move forward and pretend it didn’t happen. But, as the saying goes, those who don’t learn from history are doomed to repeat it.On 20 April 2020I tweeted, “At what point will the British public realise what has happened over the past 9 weeks?” On Thursday, theCovid inquirypublished itsmodule 2 reporton the political response to the pandemic. The answer finally to my tweet, more than five years later.Already back then it seemed that the UK government (through its late and chaotic response) had taken the worst path, leading totens of thousands of deathsand a draconian lockdown. The inquiry report states clearly what many could see at the time. Had it followed a containment path similar to the best performing countries, such as South Korea, Denmark, Norway and New Zealand, England could have avoided multiple lockdowns and arguably the majority of deaths in 2020. From January 2020, other countries wereshowing the waythrough early action and strong public health systems based on test, trace and isolation.The report confirms that we had a distracted and absent prime minister in Boris Johnson, badly advised and working within adysfunctional No 10. Not surprising, then, that devolved administrations didn’t trust the prime minister. In defiance of logic, we were all told to stay at home and not to travel beyond a certain distance, whileairports remained openwith no checks on passengers coming in. It was like trying to empty a bathtub with the tap still on. Nonsensical.Move forward to summer 2020 and the UK government, led by Rishi Sunak as chancellor and without consultation with scientists or devolved governments,triggered a second wavewith his “eat out to help out” scheme, which incentivised people to go into venues where there was a high risk of transmission and infection. Baffling. Food to be collected or taken away (which would have also supported struggling hospitality businesses) wasn’t part of the scheme.For full disclosure, I was asked to givewritten and oral evidenceto this module of the inquiry. From February 2020 onwards, my team at the University of Edinburgh repurposed a major grant from the Wellcome Trust to work on Covid. Using international datafrom governments and academics, my view was that we needed to suppress the virus to the lowest possible level and go after clusters as soon as they emerged until a vaccine was approved and rolled out.Genomic researchshows that Scotland did manage to extinguish the first strains of the virus before they were reimported in summer 2020 through travel. Again, there isno point draining the bathtub if the tap stays open. But this is all old news.The Covid story has a relatively happy ending: vaccines saved us from a disastrous future and delinked cases and hospitalisations, bringing the death rate from Covid below that of seasonal flu. The heroes of the Covid story are science and the NHS (and immigration, as evenJohnson attested to, given the international healthcare team who treated him for severe Covid in hospital).Reflecting on the report, I can’t help but wonder what it adds to our understanding of what happened politically, and what lessons it offers for the future. It’s an eye-wateringly expensive undertaking: it has alreadycost almost £200m, and Scotland is having its own ongoing inquiry at acost of £45m. Most of these costs are for the legal teams. Compare this with all the independent scientists on expert advisory groups who worked pro bono for hundreds of hours over two years. I can’t see anything in the module 2 report that hasn’t already been covered in published books, articles and analysis about what happened and why.From a scientific perspective, the report could never hope to provide one off-the-shelf plan for responding to every pathogen with pandemic potential. The response to one virus won’t work for another and each isdependent on the characteristicsof the specific outbreak. What we really need for our politicians to respond effectively to the next potential pandemic are agile leadership, smart decision-making, flexibility, humility and trustworthiness.

But how does one learn lessons from this in a democracy that lets people vote for the party they want to lead the country? Surely it’s about voting in competence over entertainment. Voting in those who are detail-oriented, thorough and hardworking. I think ofJacinda Ardernas an example of someone with these qualities – and why New Zealand fared so well during the pandemic.I hold out more hope for theinquiry reporton government procurement when it is released. The more shocking story of the pandemic was thecorruption enabledby Conservative government ministers. Analysis by theNew York Timesof 1,200 government contracts worth nearly $22bn during the pandemic found that almost half went to companies run by friends and associates of Conservative party politicians, or those with no experience in the area.Jolyon Maugham highlightedthe “vast financial rewards you could reap if you had a minister looking out for your interests”. His Good Law Project estimates thatmore than £4 in every £5spent on PPE was wasted or lost.Some people see suffering and want to help. Some see the same situation and think easy money. What the inquiry could do is recommend legislation that safeguards the system and taxpayers’ pounds against profiteering in a crisis. This has to be done now, in a time of “peace”. We need strict rules so that even when certain greedy types think a disaster is a chance to get rich off the public dime, and politicians are willing to enable it, the law prevents it from happening.I can’t help but think ofMichelle Mone, who has become the face of this hidden group of pandemic profiteers. Why don’t we call legislation to protect taxpayers’ money – and improve trust in our politicians and government – the Dame Michelle Mone Law? That would be a great recommendation to come from the next part of the inquiry.Prof Devi Sridhar is chair of global public health at the University of EdinburghFit Forever: Wellness for midlife and beyondOn Wednesday 28 January 2026, join Annie Kelly, Devi Sridhar, Joel Snape and Mariella Frostrup, as they discuss how to enjoy longer and healthier lives, with expert advice and practical tips.Book ticketshereor atguardian.liveDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

As we get ready to mix, mingle and carouse, I think it’s important to set the record straight on something: small talk is great!People love to complain about small talk. OnReddit, people say it’s “painful”, “dishonest” and “a chore”. Some of my own friends have called it “boring” and “exhausting”. A 2016Wiredarticle titled “Small talk should be banned” argued that idle chit-chat “does not build relationships and does not make us happier”, but persists because “we actively seek the lowest common denominator”. Instead, the authors suggest deeper conversation topics, such as: “What is your relationship with God?” or What is something you fear in life?”I’m here to say, respectfully: all of this is wrong.First, I find the anti-small talk position arrogant, marked by a sense that the holder is more thoughtfully and deeply engaged with life than everyone else. When I was in middle school, I knew a kid who only listened to inaccessible goth rock and dismissed anyone who listened to the top 40 as shallow and stupid. That’s how small talk haters sound to me: “You want to talk about the weather? Uh, ever heard of mortality?!”Sure, small talk sucks sometimes. I once got trapped talking to someone for 30 minutes about pencil lead. But you can’t always expect everyone to meet you in the mucky depths of human existence. Maybe the person you’re talking to had a long day and still has to go home and make dinner and put their kids to sleep. You’re going to demand they reflect on what happens after we die? Everyone’s just trying to get through the day, and sometimes the easiest way is to debate whether Chrishell Stause is right toleave Selling Sunset(she is).“I find small talk incredibly useful,” says Lizzie Post, co-president of the Emily Post Institute, which provides etiquette advice and training. She describes small talk as a “safety zone” for people to be in together. Religion, sex and politics are all excellent conversation topics, she says, but they may not feel accessible or comfortable to everyone all the time. Chatting about last night’s football game, the food at an event or someone’s hobbies is a much easier way to build initial rapport. Then, if the other person seems open, you can dip your toe into deeper topics.A couple of years ago, for example, a man in his late 60s sat next to me on a plane and we started chatting. We said hello and exchanged niceties about the weather (hot) and why we were traveling (to see family). We talked about work and recent vacations, and by the end of the two-hour flight, I knew all about his various career pivots, and how psilocybin had transformed his life and saved his marriage. Interesting! But we only got there because we started with small talk. Had I opened with, “What is your experience with psychedelics and how have they affected your relationships,” that might have been off-putting.Post suspects some people don’t like small talk because it doesn’t always allow them to be the star of the show – if you ask someone about their hobbies, then you have to listen to what they say. This can be challenging for those who prefer to be the talker. “Some people want to be seen in a certain way, and don’t feel like small talk gets them to be seen in that interesting way,” she says.And if you think small talk is boring, that may be a skill issue. It requires a real back-and-forth, even if it doesn’t plumb the depths of someone’s soul. Listening attentively can significantly improve the quality of your chit-chat, Post says. “Have your radar up,” she explains. Pay attention to whether the other person seems interested, and if they’ve contributed anything to the conversation. If you’ve been talking for a long time and the other person hasn’t said anything on the topic, they’re probably bored. “Maybe their eyes have glazed over a little bit,” Post says. “I would take it as a sign to change the topic, and ask them something about themselves.” She suggests a question like: “What’s keeping you interested these days?”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWell ActuallyFree weekly newsletterPractical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good lifeEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But consider this: sitting in a kiddie pool and sunning yourself while sipping a soda is far more relaxing than shivering in the open ocean. Shallow can be delightful! So go forth, and gab about public transit and a new restaurant you heard was pretty good.

Rinse and repeat.This time it feels a bit different, however. Reports on Friday suggested the US has threatened that ifUkrainedoes not sign a hastily concocted peace plan, Washington could withdraw intelligence-sharing and other support critical to the Ukrainian war effort.Zelenskyyaddressed the nation, saying Ukraine was faced with a choice of “losing our dignity or the risk of losing our key partner”. He spoke of an extremely difficult week ahead, and of unbearable pressure being put on Kyiv.1:50Zelenskyy warns of 'most difficult moment in history' amid pressure to accept US plan – videoThe timing is particularly bad for Ukraine: the war’s fourth winter is shaping up to be its most difficult, as the country faces an acute power shortage after Russian attacks on infrastructure. Morale is flagging, people are exhausted and Zelenskyy’s inner circle isembroiled in a huge corruption scandal.Trump, for his part, is in a hurry, reportedly keen to get a deal done before Thanksgiving next Thursday, and perhaps with one eye on the“Fifa peace prize”, apparently created solely as a gift to his ego, which he is expected to be given at the World Cup draw in Washington DC on 5 December.That timeline seems like wishful thinking in the extreme, and as with any plan emerging from the Trump administration, there are more unknowns than knowns. Has Trump himself signed off on it? Has Putin? Is the plan meant to be a starting point for discussion or a final document? Did Rustem Umerov, secretary of Ukraine’s security council, agree to some or all of it during recent discussions with the US envoy Steve Witkoff in Florida? Is the plan that surfaced in the media even the “real plan”, or merely a draft leaked bythe Russian sideto get ahead of the game?What do we know about the reported US-Russian plan to end the Ukraine war?Read moreThese are just a few of the many questions being asked by European leaders as they scramble to get to grips with anotherTrump administrationmove that has left them blindsided.The odds seem stacked against this initiative bearing any lasting fruit, but ruling out entirely that Trump’s aggressive diplomacy could lead to some kind of deal would be premature. It could be a disastrous deal for Ukraine, however. Zelenskyy’s solemn bearing on Friday afternoon shows how worried he is about what is being put in front of him.For all the public bravado, there has been a private admission in some parts of the Ukrainian elite that a deal may need to be done sooner rather than later, even if everyone sees Moscow as a bad-faith negotiating partner.1:08Ukraine is 'geared up for clear and honest work', says Zelenskyy after US peace plan – videoSome European intelligence services have also come to the conclusion that the military, social and economic conditions may compel Ukraine to sign a deal at some point soon. “Ukraine may need to make some very unpleasant compromises, including giving up territory, and it may happen in the next six months,” said one European intelligence official earlier this autumn.But the plan as it stands seems far too outlandish for Zelenskyy to sell to his population. It would involve Ukraine withdrawing from some territory it still controls, agreeing to an amnesty for all Russian war crimes, and relying on vaguely defined US security guarantees – for which the US would apparently charge – to prevent another Russian incursion in a few weeks, months or years.“This kind of proposal is not even worth the paper it’s written on,” said another European intelligence official, from a different country, referring to the plan’s assertion that Russia would not be expected to launch further military action.Post-deal security guarantees have always been the key sticking point for any lasting peace, and if they rely on vague Trump-backed promises or Russian expressions of goodwill, few in Ukraine or Europe more widely will be convinced.“What we see from the Russian side is that they have a strong feeling that they can influence the US administration in a way that is beneficial to them … but while such plans can be drawn up and discussed without Ukraine and Europe, I don’t think they can be signed or implemented without Europe,” the official said.Explore more on these topicsUkraineVolodymyr ZelenskyyUS foreign policyEuropeRussiaDonald TrumpTrump administrationanalysisShareReuse this content"

Take our quizTest your knowledge in eight questions to prove you know your onions from your emulsifiersNatasha MayFri 21 Nov 2025 09.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 21 Nov 2025 17.39 ESTShareA major global report released this week linked ultra-processed foods toharm in every major human organ. For people in the US, the UK and Australia, these foods make upmore than half the calories they consume each day.But it’s not always easy to tell which foods are ultra-processed.The term was coinedin 2009by researchers at the University of São Paulo, as part of theirNova food classification systemthat sorts foods into four groups:Group one: unprocessed or minimally processed foods including whole fruits and vegetables, milk, oats and rice.Group two: processed basic ingredients used in cooking including salt, sugar and vegetable oils.Group three: processed foods made by adding items from groups one and two. Includes canned legumes, bread and cheese.Group four: ultra-processed foods which are commercial products made from extracts of foods, often with added chemicals, flavours and other ingredients you wouldn’t find in a home kitchen.While there can be health harms from an unbalanced diet of foods in any of the groups – for example,those containing too much salt– researchers say the problem with group four is that the processes used to make them and the industrial ingredients they contain mean they are not “real food” and are more likely to cause health problems.But they can be hard to spot. A long ingredients list withnames you don’t recognise (hello maltodextrin and soy lecithin) is a giveaway for ultra-processed foods.If you’re unsure, theOpen Food Factsapp lets you search for products and see their category. In the meantime, test your knowledge of ultra-processed foods with our quiz.1.Let’s start easy.

Case said that while he was not allowed to give advice during pre-budget access talks, he believed the same.“In Whitehall we were very worried about the promises they made before the election on not raising taxes because we obviously knew the true state of the public finances that would face them on arrival,” said Case, who left the role last December and is now a cross-bench peer.View image in fullscreenSimon Case is now a cross-bench peerPhotograph: Simon Dawson/ReutersIf Wednesday’s budget fails to get to grips with ingrained problems connected to tax, spending and debt, voters might abandon centrist parties for the likes of Reform UK, Case indicated.“Yes, this budget is going to be critical to the fortunes ofKeir Starmerand Rachel Reeves, which are intertwined,” he said. “But this budget is even higher stakes than that, because it raises the question of whether centre-ground governments can answer the fundamental questions that are hampering the UK. And if they can’t, voters will look elsewhere. It’s a really pivotal moment.”The arguments about whether particular tax rises may or may not break a manifesto pledge were, to an extent, missing the wider point, Case argued.“We talk about a few billion here or there that’s going to be enormously politically significant, because it’s the difference between breaking the manifesto rather than accepting the fact the process is unsustainable,” he said.“Nobody is having the really big conversation: if we’re going to dramatically change the UK economy we need to be talking about how we spend hundreds of billions.”Reeves’s woes are deep-rooted, he said: “Some of this is to do with the current political situation, of course. But there are other long-running issues that just feel like they’re getting harder and harder.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

There’s also great pressure to spend on public services because they’re not performing as we’d like. Every budget now for the next few years is going to be incredibly difficult.”One confirmed measure in the budget is a renewed crackdown on illegal vapes, involving new powers for border and tax officials to clamp down on the products, as well as QR codes for legal ones to make it easier to spot fakes.The move comes five months after the government passed a ban on single-use vapes in an attempt to reduce environmental damage and stop their widespread use among children. Since the ban was passed, however, the government has struggled to limit the proliferation of illegal products.Officials said Reeves would use her budget to unveil a series of new tools to fight the illegal vape trade. They include giving Border Force and HM Revenue and Customs the power to seize illegal vapes on the spot and fine rogue traders up to £10,000 for breaking the law.A government source said: “Britain’s high streets are being flooded with illegal vapes by rogue traders. The chancellor will crack down hard – giving Border Force and HMRC the power to seize dodgy vapes on the spot and hit offenders with £10,000 fines.

However, I am confident that my colleagues and I have acted professionally, patiently, and in good faith throughout.”Your Party has faced a series of splits and disagreements in its short history, mainly pitting Sultana, who was elected as a Labour MP but now sits as an independent, against Corbyn, the former Labour leader, and four other independents who were allied with the group.Last week, Mohamed and Hussain, plus the two other independent MPs and Corbyn, signed a Your Party statement accusing Sultana ofunnecessary delay in passing on £850,000 in donations, a move that infuriated Sultana.Allies of Sultana accused other MPs in Your Party of trying to undermine her with the statement, saying the timing, just before Sultana appeared on BBC One’s Question Time, seemed intended to hamper her chances of winning a possible leadership contest against Corbyn.In response, Your Party sources said Sultana was creating unnecessary barriers in arguing that there were legal reasons why she could not immediately transfer all the money. More of the money has since been transferred, and that row appears to have calmed.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It could keep its national dignity or risk losing a major partner in the shape of a US administration apparently determined to end the conflict on Moscow’s brutal terms.“Now the pressure on Ukraine is one of the heaviest,” he said. Its options included agreeing to Trump’s 28-point proposal or “an extremely difficult winter”, which has already seen Russia destroy much of the country’senergy infrastructure, with millions of people left without heating and in the dark.Agreeing to the US-Russian plan could leaveUkraine“without freedom, dignity and justice”, he said. It would also mean believing “someone who has already attacked us twice”, he said, adding that he would never sacrifice Ukraine’s interests or go against its constitution. “We did not betray Ukraine then [in 2022], and we will not do so now,” he declared.Speaking on Fox radio, Trump said he thought Thursday was an “appropriate time” for Zelenskyy to sign the deal, and said he believed Ukraine could not prevent Russia’s army from taking the Donbas territories by force.The US president is pursuing an “aggressive timeline” to end the conflict, US officials indicated, and intends to heap unprecedented pressure on Kyiv.Trump is also threatening to cut vital intelligence sharing and weapons supplies for Ukraine if it fails to agree, reports suggest.AUS official, when asked whether the US could cut off intelligence sharing or logistical support if Kyiv did not sign the deal, said: “It was strongly implied to the Ukrainians that the United States expects them to agree to a peace deal. Any changes will be decided upon by the president himself.”On Friday, European leaders pushed back on the proposal, which Ukrainian politicians say is “absurd”.Speaking at the White House later on Friday, Trump repeated that he had expected to resolve the war much sooner given his good relationship with the Russian president,Vladimir Putin, adding, “It does take two to tango.”Referring to Zelenskyy, Trump said: “He’ll have to like it, and if he doesn’t like it, then you know, they should just keep fighting … at some point he’s going to have to accept something.”Trump may yet impose a Ukraine deal – but it threatens to be a disaster for KyivRead moreThe 28-point plan envisages Ukraine giving up the eastern Donbas region – including areas it currently controls – and shrinking the size of its army. It rules out the deployment of European peacekeepers and says Kyiv must relinquish long-range weapons and not join Nato.On Friday, Zelenskyy spoke by telephone with the US vice-president, JD Vance, who has previously pressured Ukraine to make a deal with Russia to end the war as quickly as possible.Following the hour-long call, Zelenskyy gave a cautious statement that the two sides had “managed to cover a lot of details of the American side’s proposals for ending the war, and we’re working to make the path forward dignified and truly effective for achieving a lasting peace”.Both countries appointed their national security advisers to continue negotiations on the text of the draft peace plan.Western allies including France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, Germany’s chancellor, Friedrich Merz, and Britain’sKeir Starmerspoke to Zelenskyy on Friday in a show of solidarity. They reaffirmed their support for Kyiv and said any agreement to end the conflict had to be genuinely fair and take into account Ukraine’s own red lines.In contrast to the Trump proposal, which calls for Ukraine to abandon several major cities, they said the existing line of contact should be the “starting point” for territorial discussions. The text also had to take into account the long-term interests of Europe and Ukraine, they stressed.The British prime minister urged a “just and lasting peace”. He said: “That’s what the president of America wants. That’s what we all want, and so we need to work from where we are to that end. But the principle that Ukraine must determine its future under its sovereignty is a fundamental principle.”Starmer is set to meet Ukraine’s allies at the Johannesburg G20 summit on Saturday to seek to “strengthen” a US-drafted plan.G7 leaders plus others from the G20 will discuss the deal on the sidelines ofthe South African meeting shunned by Donald Trump.The EU’s foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, warned that a peace deal that rewarded invasion would set a “very dangerous” global precedent.“If you just give in to the aggression, then you invite more aggression,” she said, adding that countries other than Russia could develop “an appetite” for neighbouring territory.In his address, Zelenskyy paid tribute to Ukrainians who had bravely endured “almost four years of full-scale invasion”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We are, of course, strong, but even the strongest metal can break. Don’t forget that,” he declared.Zelenskyy said he would work calmly and constructively with Washington over its plan, “offering alternatives”. It was drafted by Kirill Dmitriev, Vladimir Putin’s envoy, and Steve Witkoff, Trump’s special representative, during a meeting in Miami. Europe and Ukraine were excluded from discussions.Volodymyr Zelenskyy: why should I be afraid of Donald Trump?Read moreUkraine’s president said he was working to ensure “national interests” were respected. “Now practically every hour there are meetings, phone calls and work on issues that could change a lot,” he wrote on Telegram.He said his country welcomed US diplomatic efforts but wanted “real peace that would not be broken by a third [Russian] invasion”.Ukrainian government insiders believe that relations between Kyiv and Washington have improved dramatically since February, when Trump and Vance berated Zelenskyy and tossed him out of the Oval Office. Kyiv faces the unappealing prospect of provoking Trump’s wrath once again if it fails to swiftly accept his Moscow-drafted deal.In the immediate aftermath of the White House row, Trump briefly suspended intelligence sharing with Kyiv, cutting off a crucial channel of battlefield information for Ukraine’s frontline units.The US has stopped supplying Ukraine with direct military aid, but still provides advanced weapons systems to Kyiv under the UN’sprioritised Ukraine requirements list(Purl) initiative, in which European partners pay for them.A delegation of senior US military officials led by the army secretary, Dan Driscoll, held talks with Zelenskyy on Thursday in Kyiv. Trump has named Driscoll – Vance’s friend and former classmate – as his newest “special representative”. The group of American generals was likely to fly to Moscow at the end of next week to discuss the “peace plan” with the Kremlin, US sources said.Putin confirmed on Friday that Moscow had recieved a copy of the US plan, which he said could “lay the foundation” for an end to the war. “I believe that it could lay the foundation for a final peace settlement,” hesaid.A person close to the Kremlin said that while Putin “liked” the overall contours of the peace proposal, it fell short of other Kremlin demands. These include a legally binding guarantee that Nato will not expand further east, as well as enshrining Ukraine’s neutral status in its constitution.As for potential EU membership, the source said Moscow would only consider it if it excluded a military component, citing Austria’s model of neutrality as an example.US officials have said the text was hammered out after consultations with Rustem Umerov, Ukraine’s national security and defence council secretary, and a close Zelenskyy ally. Umerov – a former defence minister – made several modifications, they added. He denied this, saying Kyiv would not accept terms that violated its sovereignty.The reaction from Ukrainian civil society has been overwhelmingly negative. People have variously dismissed the plan as one-sided and tantamount to Ukraine’s abject surrender. It comes as Zelenskyy is under immense pressure at home after acorruption scandalinvolving his former business partner and at least two of his ministers.The plan also failed to win over senior European commentators. Constanze Stelzenmüller of the Brookings Institute described its drafting as “appalling” and said its substance was “outrageous”.If enacted, it would lead to Russia becoming the “apex predator in Europe”, she observed. “Truly marks the complete enshittification of diplomacy,” she added on X.Reform UK leader Nigel Farage, an ally of the US president, expressed opposition to the Trump administration plan.“Ukraine being asked to halve the size of its army is unacceptable. I am waiting to see a counter-proposal from Zelensky’s government,” he posted on X.Explore more on these topicsUkraineVolodymyr ZelenskyyEuropeDonald TrumpRussiaVladimir PutinEuropean UnionnewsShareReuse this content"

A first draft of the potential outcome text from the summit had contained the formulation, but in the updated draft text produced on Friday by the Brazilian presidency it had been excised.Miliband told the Guardian that “one way or another” there would be an outcome from the two-week summit that contained the pledge, but that it might be in an altered form, or could be a voluntary initiative rather than a binding commitment.“We are fighting for the roadmap for the transition away from fossil fuels, and we’ve determined that one way or another we won’t lose the momentum [towards that outcome] that we’ve built at this Cop,” he said. “There’s a big coalition that wants this, of developing and developed countries.”Cop30 delegates ‘far apart’ on phasing out fossil fuels and cutting carbonRead moreMore than 80 countries, developed and developing, havebacked the call for a roadmap to “transition away from fossil fuels”, but scores of countries are against it. The Arab Group, of which Saudi Arabia is the most prominent member, has led the opposition, but Russia, Bolivia, some African countries and some countries that are heavy consumers of fossil fuels have also rejected the wording.Miliband said: “We need to think creatively about the possible ways in which we could get this roadmap process going. What matters to me is the outcome, that this roadmap gets launched, the countries can engage in it, and it gets to be considered by a Cop in the future. We’ve got a critical mass of countries that want that to happen. But there’s different ways of doing it. We’re looking at all of the creative ways in which that can happen.”The EU was also urging countries behind the scenes to come out publicly in favour of the transition away from fossil fuels. Climate commissioner Wopke Hoekstra earlier on Friday called the text without the commitment “unacceptable”. He added: “Given that we’re so far away from where we should be, it’s unfortunate to say, but we’re really facing a no-deal situation.”Some developing countries have been angered by the insistence on a phaseout. Richard Muyungi, envoy to the president of Tanzania, and current chair of the African Group of Nations, accused rich countries, including the EU, of holding the poor to ransom on the issue. He claimed that they were opposing Africa’s call for a tripling of the finance available to poor countries to help them adapt to the impacts of the climate crisis, to about $120bn (£92bn) a year, because some African countries would not back the fossil fuel roadmap.“The phaseout of fossil fuels is not an African issue. We emit only 4% of total global emissions, and we have never discussed a phaseout. We have been discussing a phasedown,” he said. “Why are we being held to ransom? It’s like you are trading our lives with something we never caused. So they were saying, ‘If you do not accept a phaseout, we cannot give you the triple of adaptation.’ We said, ‘We cannot accept that.’”Juan Carlos Monterrey, Panama’s special representative for climate change, had a different view. “What we have also seen is the EU are willing to engage constructively on adaptation finance. I have had direct conversations with them and the UK. But I also understand that we need more ambition [on cutting fossil fuel emissions] in the text for them to open up the chequebook a little bit more. The two go together,” he said.The Guardian understands fromvarious countries’ delegatesthatChina is not among the countries blocking a fossil fuel phaseout roadmap, while India has taken a harder line by insisting developed countries bear responsibility for past greenhouse gas emissions.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

But even if that doesn’t make it into the final package, the signal from this Cop is clear – a big and growing number of countries recognise that a managed, collectively navigated route to fossil fuel phase-out is preferable to the chaotic absence of planning we currently have.”Explore more on these topicsCop30Ed MilibandFossil fuelsFossil fuel divestmentEnergyUnited NationsBrazilnewsShareReuse this content"

Nathan Gill, a former leader of Reform UK in Wales, admitted taking payments to makestatements in favour of Russia.The sentencing came at the end of a damaging week for Farage in which the Guardian revealedaccusations that he engaged in racist chants and commentswhile at school more than 40 years ago, which he denies.Reform UK remains about 10 points ahead in opinion polls, but Labour believes the party is vulnerable to criticism that Farage and his allies have been too pro-Russia, with the Gill case proving that a paid pro-Kremlin propagandist was allowed to rise to become a senior leader.Police believe Gill received the equivalent of at least £30,000 and could have got even more from Oleg Voloshyn, a former Ukrainian MP and alleged Russian asset. The offences took place when Gill was an MEP in 2018-19, having been elected as one of the Ukip group led by Farage, and later joining the Brexit party.Voloshyn remains under investigation and wanted for high treason in Ukraine but is now believed to be in Moscow.The political fallout from the case also appeared to widen on Friday as it emerged Gill had been paid to arrange for other Brexit party and former Ukip MEPs to make pro-Russia statements, without their awareness.The statements by Gill in the European parliament and on 112 Ukraine, a pro-Russian TV channel, were designed to benefit the Kremlin’s narrative onUkrainein the period before Russia’s full-scale invasion of its neighbour in 2022.A sentencing note from the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) indicated that four other MEPs who had been in Ukip with Gill made interventions, after he was promised bribes from Voloshyn to arrange for them to make statements. These include Steven Woolfe, William Dartmouth, Jonathan Arnott and Jonathan Bullock.A fifth, David Coburn, who had been in Ukip and was the party’s leader in Scotland at one point, was also mentioned in WhatsApp messages between Voloshyn and Gill. None of them were found by investigators to have received money themselves.Voloshyn repeatedly passed on praise for Gill’s work from Viktor Medvedchuk, a loyal ally and friend of Vladimir Putin for decades linked to the pro-Russian 112 Ukraine channel.At one point, after the appearances of Gill’s fellow Eurosceptic British MEPs on the channel, Voloshyn messaged Gill on WhatsApp to say: “V asked to pass you his gratitude. He literally said it was ‘awesome’. He even boasted with those MEP comments to his friend you know where and that person was impressed.”Farage said Gill was a single “bad apple” after Gill pleaded guilty to eight counts of bribery. On the day of the sentencing, Reform UK said Gill’s actions were “reprehensible, treasonous and unforgivable” and the party was “glad that justice has been served”.However, Labour called on Farage to “leave no stone unturned” in reviewing “every inch” of Reform UK’s party structures, membership, party donors and representatives, to ensure any remaining pro-Russian links were rooted out.Starmer told the BBC: “I think it begs a very important question, because this is a long prison sentence for pro-Russian bribes, and I think that that demands that Nigel Farage investigate how that happened within his party, and, equally importantly, what other links there are between his party and Russia.“He should set up an inquiry, an investigation into his own party. How did that happen on his watch, in his party, and what other links are there between his party and Russia?”Hitting back, Farage attempted to deflect the story on to Labour, saying: “The prime minister needs to urgently investigate the links with the Chinese Communist party within the Labour party.“Spies have been discovered donating to Labour MPs and there has been the mysterious collapse of a recent spy trial. Perhaps he needs to look closer to home.”The Conservatives said Farage must “come clean on the nature of his relationship with Gill and clearly set out if others in his party were ever involved”, while the Liberal Democrats launched new political attack ads showing the Reform UK leader in Putin’s pocket.Investigators who were taken by surprise by Gill’s guilty plea in September say he has given no explanation of his motivation but believe he was largely driven by financial need.Sentencing Gill at the Old Bailey in London, Mrs Justice Cheema-Grubb said he had betrayed the trust placed in him by the public.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

If it were your genuine opinion, you would not need to be paid for saying it,” she said.Before sentencing at the Old Bailey, Gill was greeted on arrival by Ukrainians and British trade unionists chanting: “What about Farage?”Police have not interviewed Farage, unlike some of his former colleagues and aides who helped the authorities voluntarily. Arnott has spoken to the police as a potential witness, the Guardian understands. Another Brexit party MEP, Alex Phillips, said she had voluntarily gone to speak to the police when she learned of the investigation into Gill. The CPS note states Gill had promised to his handler Voloshyn that he would “get Alex [Phillips]” to speak.The CPS also released selected WhatsApp messages between Voloshyn and Gill that included references to Arnott and Coburn.Both visited Ukraine with Gill on an October 2018 trip, making statements on the 112 Ukraine channel. Weeks later they made statements during a debate on Ukraine in the European parliament after Gill spoke.Arnott has rejected any suggestion that he had links to Russia or was acting in its interests. Attempts have been made to contact Coburn.The judge said Gill had enlisted MEPs representing the north-east, north-west and south-west of England to give interviews to 112 Ukraine, for which he received €5,000 (£4,400).“I must make it clear that the case has not been presented on the basis that those individuals knew how you were acting, namely that you had been promised altogether €5,000 for it,” said the judge, who noted that Voloshyn had described Gill’s work as “outstanding”.WhatsApp messages between Gill and Voloshyn were recovered after the British politician was stopped at Manchester airport in September 2021. Gill said he was going to Russia to act as an observer in elections to the Duma, according to police.Starmer accuses ‘spineless’ Farage of failure to tackle racism in Reform partyRead moreDominic Murphy, the head of the Metropolitan police counter-terrorism command, told reporters that the messages used coded language at first – with talk of “xmas presents” and “gifts” – but it was clear that Gill’s collaboration eventually became a “regular habit”, with Voloshyn making comments such as: “I’ll get you 5k.”Footage of Gill being questioned by police, in which he repeatedly answers “no comment”, has been released by the Met. Police also seized €5,000 in cash and thousands of dollars from Gill’s home but say they do not know what he did with the entire amount of bribes he received.In an emailed response to the Guardian after Gill’s sentencing, Voloshyn said he was “astonished” to hear the verdict. He said he found it “totally unfair” as he said neither he nor Gill had participated in any conspiracy targeted against the legislation and security of the UK.Explore more on these topicsReform UKNigel FaragenewsShareReuse this content"

In modern times, it is no surprise that the parties Gill represented were Ukip, the Brexit party, and brieflyReform UK.When seeking a sympathetic vessel for pro-Russia views, the nationalist, anti-EU and anti-migrant parties of Europe have been obvious targets for Vladimir Putin’s Russia – which have a shared hostility towards the European bloc.Farage, who led Ukip, theBrexitparty and now Reform, and was a longstanding associate of Gill, has claimed the former MEP was a “bad apple” who betrayed his party and country.But Farage’s ownpublicly expressed views on Russiaand Putin appear to have created an environment in which those more sympathetic than most to Moscow have been drawn to his parties.The court case shows that while Gill was the only MEP found to have taken payments for making pro-Russia statements, some of his colleagues had been making similar points in favour of Moscow’s narrative on the war in Ukraine without reward.Farage himself, who has not been under scrutiny as part of the investigation or played in role in assisting it, has spoken of his admiration for Putin as a political operator and repeatedly warned the west against “poking the Russian bear with a stick”, in recent years accusing it of provoking the war in Ukraine.Back in 2014,he cited Putin as the politician he most admired, “as an operator but not as a human being”. Asked whether he regretted making the comments at the time, Farage told a Chatham House audience: “I said I don’t like him, I wouldn’t trust him and I wouldn’t want to live in his country, but compared with the kids who run foreign policy in this country, I’ve more respect for him than our lot.”He also made at least 17 appearances on state-owned Russia Today between 2010 and 2014, on which he made no criticisms of Russian democracy and claimedEuropewas governed not by elected democracies but instead “by the worst people we have seen in Europe since 1945”.Cryptocurrency backed by Farage donor is used for Russian war effort, investigators sayRead moreThe issue of Russia is also felt by some Reform insiders to have harmed the party in last year’s election, when Farage repeated his views since the 1990s that “the ever-eastward expansion” of the Nato military alliance and the EU was giving Putin “a reason to [give to] his Russian people to say ‘they’re coming for us again’ and to go to war”. He added: “We provoked this war. Of course, it’s his fault.”Reform UK as a party now appears to sense there is some political danger in appearing too generous towards Russia, given it is ahead in the polls and public opinion in the UK is firmly pro-Ukraine and anti-Moscow. The party said on Friday that Gill had acted in a “reprehensible, treasonous and unforgivable” way.However, Farage’s own views on Russia and Ukraine are likely to be further tested – particularly on whether he still believes the west provoked the war.Labour, no doubt, scents the possibility of undermining Reform UK’s poll lead by calling on Farage to root out pro-Russia views within his party and to disavow “Putin talking points” such as the idea that the west and Ukraine provoked Putin’s invasion.Farage is not a politician known for letting go of long-held positions, even when it is politically expedient. But it would be good politics by Reform to take their rival party’s advice.Explore more on these topicsReform UKRussiaVladimir PutinNigel FarageUkraineEuropeLabouranalysisShareReuse this content"

The number working full-time inEnglandhas fallen by a third.Graphic showing the share of GPs, categorised by age, who are working full timeThe figures – which exclude GPs in training or working as locum doctors – show that doctors are increasingly choosing to work part-time. Just 7,480 were listed as working more than 37.5 hours a week in September, compared with more than 11,000 in 2017.The shift in declared hours has mainly been driven by younger and early middle-aged GPs near the start of their careers. Fewer than 8% of 30- to 34-year-old GPs work full-time – down from 22% in March 2017. There has been a similar decrease among 35- to 40-year-olds and 40- to 44-year-olds.Recently qualified GPs appearto be unwilling or unable to do a full-time working week of clinical duty on the NHS. Dozens of GPs got in touch with the Guardian to share why they had cut their hours or were looking to do so, with most early career GPs blaming the unrelenting stress of the job.One in three GPs in England do not work in NHS, says BMJ studyRead moreYasmin*, a 29-year-old GP from Leicestershire, realised even before completing training that she had underestimated the pressures of the job.“The pace was unsustainable for me,” she said. “When you’re always late to leave work, making decisions all day and facing people’s constant anger about the service you are offering, it’s easy to feel resentful, like you want to wrench your life back from the thankless, unyielding claws of the NHS, and of the general public.”Yasmin works two days a week in a clinical GP role. “I’m paid for 16.5 hours but work for about 22, as I arrive early, leave late, and never take my breaks,” she said. “For the rest of the week, I teach GP residents. I’m already at my limit.”While most GPs are working less than full-time contractually, the BMA says that they may be putting in additional unpaid hours to do administrative work, a point that was made by various respondents.“While many GPs are part-time on paper, in reality they are working above their contracted hours,” said Joe, 33, from Brighton who is also working two days a week as an NHS GP.“A full GP day is eight hours 20 minutes, but my surgery is open for patients for nine and a half hours, and I can’t remember the last time I had a lunch break. Add a couple of hours of paperwork, and it’s usually approaching 11-12 hours a day. This is very mentally draining, and I feel at high risk of burnout if I were to do this more regularly.”A lack of GPs, however, is not the problem: while salaried GPs across all age groups have been reducing their hours, many locum GPs are struggling to find work, as practices hire fewer locums and salaried GPs due to NHS reforms that have led to budget constraints.Lucy-Jane, an unemployed GP from Devon who completed her training in 2023, was among scores of locum doctors who reported that they were struggling to find workdespite millions of patients struggling to see their GP.Patient satisfaction with GP services in England has collapsed, research findsRead more“The year before I qualified, there were still lots of jobs in general practice, but the work gradually dried up,” she said. “I feel that I’m on the scrapheap. Friends and family find it shocking that I can’t get a job, and everyone talks about how they are desperate to see a GP.”The total number of GPs has increased in recent years. Arecent studyin the British Medical Journal found that more GPs are being trained, but proportionally fewer are working in NHS general practice. More than a third of licensed GPs (19,900)were not working in NHS general practicein 2024 – up from just 27% in 2015. Female GPs, younger GPs, UK-qualified GPs, and GPs in London and the south-east were the most likely groups to be qualified but not working in the NHS.A 49-year-old part-time GP partner from Somerset said three of her trainees had emigrated to Canada soon after they had completed costly NHS training. “They are international graduates who came here to work, but now qualified find the NHS a hostile work environment and have moved to other countries with a better work-life balance,” she said.While many GPs who got in touch said they had reduced their hours or quit due to unsustainable workloads, burnout or to achieve a better work-life balance, many others, particularly older GPs, cited a lack of job satisfaction as the main reason – the perceived inability to do the job they had trained and signed up for.Anne Mellor, 52, an NHS GP partner from Doncaster, said she was planning to quit what used to be her “dream job” and retrain as a coach or counsellor.“I have reduced my hours to part-time over the past three years becausethe changes imposed upon us, such as funding changes and being forced to work with other practices within Primary Care Networks, mean that we are providing a worse service to our patients,” she said.Recent reforms, she said, had reduced the number of available local GP appointments, meaning patients now had to travel farther to be seen by unfamiliar locum doctors or nurse practitioners instead of their family doctor.Some GPs who got in touch cited not being able to find wraparound childcare as a reason for reducing their hours. Others said they and many of their colleagues had cut their hours to qualifyfor the government’s free childcare offer.“I’m older and started when working 100 hours a week, on average, was a normal part of the job,” said Adam, a GP from the Midlands in his 50s. “I now do four days a week, but almost none of my younger colleagues do more than three days [to qualify for free childcare].”One of the most cited reasons among older GPs for reducing their hours was the motivation to escape what many described as punitive income taxation.Andrew, 61, a GP from Norfolk, said he had gone down to three and a half days because the pension system allowed him to draw more than £3,500 monthly from his pension while working. “I have more money working less. My patients now will need to wait longer to see me, and many will prefer to wait, to receive continuity of care.”Tax incentives that tempt the most experienced GPs to reduce their hours, many pointed out, had substantial effects on the quality of care patients were receiving.“We are an ageing population, and dealing with many co-morbidities in one patient is a major issue,” said a 51-year-old GP from the north-west who is looking to reduce to three days soon, as “working longer hours is no longer in your interest financially”.Older GPs going part-time or retiring early and being replaced by newly qualified part-time GPs, locums and lower-paid healthcare staff such as physiotherapists and nurses, she felt, was all part of the system’s “gradual deterioration”. This echoed the views of scores of other doctors.“We need experienced clinicians in the system to guide those lacking the expertise to deal with all these patients with complex problems, otherwise everything will collapse further.”The total number of GPs has increased in recent years, despite the average GP reducing their hours – meaning the total hours worked by qualified permanent GPs a week are down by less than 1% overall.An NHS spokesperson said: “There are millions more general practice appointments for patients than before the pandemic, and increasing the number of GPs remains a key priority for the NHS to help improve access to care.“With nearly 1,300 more doctors added to general practice in the last year alone, offering greater flexibility for GPs including supporting portfolio careers is helping retain more staff and improve their working lives, while bringing additional skills into general practice.”*Name has been changedExplore more on these topicsGPsDoctorsHealthNHSWork-life balanceWork & careersEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

The leaked letter demanded that the roadmap be included in the outcome of the talks, which are due to end on Friday but are likely to continue into the weekend.An option to start the process of drawing up apotential roadmap for the “transition away from fossil fuels”was included in thefirst draft of a potential outcome from the two weeks of talks, published on Tuesday. But early on Friday morning, a “mutirão”text was published by the presidency which contained no mention of the roadmap, and no mention of the term “fossil fuels”.It was not immediately clear how countries would respond to the proposal, but the Guardian understands Brazil faced pressure from some petrostates – including Saudi Arabia, Russia and some large fossil fuel consumers including India – to omit the potential resolution.Keeping promises on renewables, energy efficiency and methane ‘would avoid nearly 1C of global heating’Read moreSome of the countries opposing the roadmap had threatened to walk out of the talks on Thursday, before afire broke out in part of the conference centre near the delegations’ officesand talks were suspended for more than six hours.A letter to the presidency seen by the Guardian shows that many of the governments in favour of a roadmap have set it as a “red line” for the talks.It reads: “We cannot support an outcome that does not include a roadmap for implementing a just, orderly, and equitable transition away from fossil fuels. This expectation is shared by a vast majority of Parties, as well as by science and by the people who are watching our work closely. The world is looking to this Cop to demonstrate continuity and progress after the Global Stocktake. Anything less would inevitably be seen as a step backward.”The global stocktake refers to thehistoric decision made at Cop28 in Dubai in 2023, which set out for the first time a pledge by all countries to “transition away from fossil fuels”, but set out no timeline for the transition and no measures on how to achieve it.Since that commitment was signed, some countries – chiefly Saudi Arabia – have tried to unpick it. In 2024, at the Cop29 talks in Azerbaijan, an attempt to reconfirm the commitment failed in the face of opposition.This year, countries in favour of the phase-out took a different tack.Some started to draw up proposals for a forum in which all countries could take part, to discuss a possible roadmap for the transition. This would not require any country to sign up to a firm deadline for a phase-out, and would allow all countries to choose their own policies and pathways. The roadmap would not be completed at this Cop but would take at least a year or more of work at future Cops to be fully articulated.More than 80 countries joined the initiative, andheld a press conference on Tuesday to announce their plans.But this was too much for the countries that are still opposed to such a commitment, led by some members of a group known as the “like-minded developing countries”, a loose grouping which includes Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Iran and Bolivia.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

The true success of this Cop lies in the quality of the outcome. Adopting a weak or empty text would signal a failure of climate multilateralism and a failure to future generations, who deserve a livable planet.”Catherine Abreu, the director of the International Climate Politics Hub, said: “It’s clear that a growing group won’t leave Belém without an ambitious package deal built on four cornerstones: money for adaptation, better quality and accountability for climate finance, a clear focus on tackling the biggest sources of climate pollution – fossil fuels and deforestation – and a commitment to drive it all with a just transition.”She added: “The question is whether the Brazil presidency will choose to listen to them, with time running out.”The fortnight-long talks in Belém were scheduled to end on Friday evening but have been delayed by the fire – in which no one was hurt but some damage was caused to the venue – and are likely to carry on into the weekend.As the talks reach their final hours, the row over the transition away from fossil fuels is likely to dominate, but other issues also remain to be resolved, including a response to the fact that countries’ national climate plans are too weak to limit global heating to 1.5C above preindustrial levels as set out in the 2015 Paris agreement, and questions of finance, trade and transparency, and how much cash developing countries will receive to help them adapt to the impacts of the climate crisis.Explore more on these topicsCop30BrazilClimate crisisClimate financeGreenhouse gas emissionsnewsShareReuse this content"

Here, three of them reveal what happens behind closed doors.‘They don’t listen. They don’t want to listen’We need to keep the 1.5C goal – it is a lifeline for the planet. We agreed itin Paris 10 years ago. If we don’t stick to it, we face devastating impacts, all over the world, but especially for low-lying areas. They are the first to feel the sea-level rises, but there are many more impacts – cyclones, storms, extreme weather that we are already seeing.And yet there are countries here who want to ignore this. They do not want to keep to theParis agreement goal of 1.5C[above preindustrial levels]. In the negotiating rooms, they argue against the measures and commitments that would enable 1.5C.We need to be guided by the science, and the science is very clear, but some of them argue against the science. The IPCC [Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the UN-convened body of the world’s leading climate experts]has made it very clear that 1.5C is critical. But you hear in the negotiating rooms people opposing the science, saying: “Oh, there is other science besides the IPCC,” that the IPCC is not “the best available science”.This is really distressing, to hear them say that. It hurts me. We keep defending it, but they don’t listen. They don’t want to listen.View image in fullscreenDelegates attend a plenary session at Cop30.Photograph: Pablo Porciúncula/AFP/Getty ImagesOr they say: “Oh, 1.5C is in the past; we are already through 1.5C; don’t talk about 1.5C.” But that’s not true either. There has been a year when [global temperatures] were over 1.5C, the hottest year ever, but that does not mean the end of the story. The Paris agreement does not depend on one year, or two years; it needs to be measured over a longer period.Sometimes I feel that this process has lost its humanity. Sometimes it’s like we are arguing with robots.Cop30 draft text omits mention of fossil fuel phase-out roadmapRead moreThe countries that are most opposed to 1.5C and the actions we need to take for it are the “like-minded developing countries” group, people like the Arab group, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, China, India. For these countries, I think, it’s about power.They are called developing countries and they talk about solidarity among developing countries, but where is their feeling for the vulnerable? Where is their humanity?Maybe it’s because the impacts of climate change are not happening to them, or not so much yet, or they ignore it. Just because we do not have money, does not mean we should not be listened to.Maybe they can never feel what we feel. I think it could be different if they were to live in our reality, just for a short while. If they could feel what our people feel. If they could see what is happening to us.Climate change will affect everybody. Just because you’re a big country or have money doesn’t mean you are safe. Don’t forget that.‘I get very frustrated with the developed countries’ positions’For my people, adaptation is not just a word that is bandied around at a Cop. It means survival. It means the difference between putting food on the table and lining up for humanitarian relief. It means whether crops fail or not. It means whether livestock live or die for lack of water.We are suffering the worst drought in 40 years in my region – we need help to adapt to the impacts of the climate crisis now. I see places in my country where there was once plenty, and now they have nothing.The developed countries we are negotiating with know this, but I don’t think they really understand it. I don’t think they feel it, in the way that we feel it passionately because we experience it.When we are in the negotiating rooms, I get very frustrated with the developed countries’ positions. We want a tripling of adaptation finance, from $40bn (£31bn) to $120bn. Developed countries agreed, last year at Cop29 in Baku, to $300bn by 2035 in climate finance, but that is for everything. It includes adaptation, mitigation [helping countries to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions], and loss and damage funding [for the rescue and rehabilitation of countries and communities affected by climate disaster]. A lot more of it should be for adaptation.View image in fullscreenThe summit, which opened on 10 November, is due to finish on Friday evening.Photograph: Pablo Porciúncula/AFP/Getty ImagesWe know that the needs for adaptation are huge and growing – about $210bn to $360bn a year is estimated.You can get private sector money for things that make a profit, like clean energy; the banks will give you money for that because they make the investment back. No private sector company will invest in the things we need for adaptation, like ways to store water from the rains, or helping farmers to grow different crops.Developed countries don’t want to give us the money, but they are supposed to. Under the Paris agreement, they agreed in article 9.1 to pay us. We know that we did not create this crisis – they did – but we are the ones who are suffering.In the negotiations, we are discussing the adaptation indicators. These are the rules, metrics and standards that the developed countries want us to follow when we do our adaptation projects. But there are more than 100 of them. Some of them are not too bad, but others are. We want to slim them down. We are trying to draw up a red list, of ones that we do not want or do not think we can meet, and a green list of ones that are OK.Some of these indicators are very intrusive. Like they want to know our domestic budget for food security and how we spend it. Countries don’t like indicators like this; they infringe on our national sovereignty. It’s like we are being told how to run our governments, what policies we should have.When it comes to adaptation, finance is key and the developed countries don’t even want to talk about that. They say that these are the adaptation rooms, where we talk about adaptation, and we only talk about finance in the finance rooms. But that should not be how it works. It can’t work like that – how can you not discuss finance when you’re talking about how you can adapt to what’s happening with the climate?‘Some are saying: “Why even come to Cop?”’Article 9.1 – the legal obligation of developed countries to provide climate finance for developing countries – is proving to be one of the crucial issues of this Cop.Provision under 9.1 is a cornerstone of the Paris agreement. It’s a matter of legal obligation. Without a big scale-up of provision of public finance, the goals of the Paris agreement cannot be met.And yet we have the European Union, the UK, and other rich historical polluter countries who have been resisting the calls from across the global south to have a dedicated space to discuss article 9.1.View image in fullscreenPeople wait to enter the Cop30 venue.Photograph: Fernando Llano/APThese countries are saying to fold this discussion into a wider discussion on all of finance, but we know from bitter experience that this doesn’t work. When we try to talk about everything, we end up talking of nothing. Rich countries talk about what is convenient for them.Rich historical polluters are saying that we don’t need to discuss provision because supposedly it was addressed last year in Bakuunder the new $300bn goal [pledged by rich countries]. This is very ironic because the amount of the $300bn that is public finance provision is totally not clear or specified, and these rich historic polluters are the reason this is the case.Some of the most senior global south negotiators are saying: “Without a space to discuss provision, why even come to Cop?”Because we know we will not be able to deliver the global goal on adaptation without increased provision of grants and concessional public finance. Because we know the loss and damage fund will remain an empty shell without a course correction on provision of public finance in grants. Because we know we cannot achieve the Paris agreement without much greater provision, solidarity, and ambition on finance from the global north.Explore more on these topicsCop30The Secret NegotiatorGreenhouse gas emissionsClimate crisisParis climate agreementClimate aidClimate financefeaturesShareReuse this content"

The table was set with giant clam shells for serving vessels and miniature hibachis for grilling Dungeness crab. Somebody had found a small, pink pineapple and secured it on the watermelon like a brooch. The hostess considered the merits of a hula dancer, but in the end settled on a more succinct spectacle: a 19lb suckling pig, enwreathed with sub-tropical flowers and caparisoned in bronze.It was, and could only ever have been, aMartha Stewartaffair. This was before the media empire, in more innocent days, when Stewart was a caterer in Connecticut. She was brilliant even then. It takes a spark of something dazzling, even dangerous, to notice a single detail – an orchid, say – and from this to extrapolate a 20-person luau. A while later, Stewart wrote about the party in Entertaining, her 1982 cookbook debut, lushly photographed and with step-by-step instructions for chicken wings with banana. “The pig wore a necklace of starfruit,” she explained. It speaks to Stewart’s generational talent for nonsense that this isn’t even in the top 10 wildest sentences in the book.View image in fullscreenA Hawaiian feast with suckling pig from Martha Stewart’s 1982 book Entertaining.Photograph: Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia, LPI have been thinking a lot about Entertaining recently. Last year I bought a bargain first edition on eBay, ostensibly in the name of serious research. I was mesmerised. It is, in short, the greatest work of literature on entertaining ever written – a cookbook, technically, but in reality something stranger and more opaque. Stewart is a master of far-out wisdom. For those without a large dining room, why not set up a couple of small, round tables in the bedroom with table linen to match the bedsheets? The evening will be enlivened by the implicit threat that it could turn, upon some imperceptible social undercurrent, into a swingers’ party. If you don’t care for fussy trinkets, you might choose a table centrepiece of a single huge Bermuda onion, or “a convoluted brown tree fungus in which [to] fix a delicate branch or a bloom”. Think about it. Be prepared. You could consider hiring a balalaika player to soundtrack a Russian-themed dinner party, or borrow a silver samovar from friends.The problems with Stewart are many and predictable. Yes, she is out of touch. She represents the worst of striving Waspy hostess culture. These recipes – the goblets of borscht, the turkey-shaped madeleines – are unrealistic for the ordinary cook. I know these grievances because they are the grievances I have had with Stewart, with all people for whom entertaining is an ambassadorial affair. And yet it is all so spectacularly beside the point to approach Stewart along these lines, like chastising the moon for its eerie, beautiful light.The trouble is, we’ve resented entertaining for as long as we’ve had the luxury of doing it. About a century ago we invented cocktail parties, a smart workaround for sit-down dinner parties that ensured we could spend less time and more money eating worse food with people we don’t like. By the 1950s, with cocktail parties and their backlash in full force, writers made up solutions like after-dinner wine parties and sitting-room dinner parties.Now, in the long shadow of the dinner party mania of the 1980s we avoid such words altogether. Instead we have people over, in the breezy, Alison Roman-inspired way,her delightful cookbookshaving become standard setters for anti-ostentatious taste. Now it’s Le Creuset dishes, not silver samovars, that signal a certain coy tastefulness. This is how things work: action, reaction, the timeless art of feeding people changing as fashion dictates. But I have to wonder whether, in our desire to never repeat the crimes of the 80s, we have overcorrected – whether we have thrown the starfruit-necklaced piglet out with the bathwater.Among the postmodern elements of Stewart-style entertaining, there is a truth that we often forget: that entertaining, in whatever form it takes, should befun. This is the entire point. Fun is not the same as casualness. It is not the same as ease. Fun comes from recognising that entertaining at home can and should be different to the usual order of things, which is why Stewart’s advocacy for tempura parties, omelette brunches for 60 and dinners of half a dozen varieties of soup delight me so much. They are reminders that great entertaining comes not from trying to replicate a restaurant at home, but imagining the whimsical, fantastical, unmarketable feasts that any serious establishment would never dare.View image in fullscreenOne of Martha Stewart’s tempura parties.Photograph: Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia, LPThis U-turn on my part has been electrifying. Out with the sincere, in with the absurd. I have been recommending Entertaining – a cookbook from which I will surely never cook – to anyone who will listen. There are lessons to be learned here, I tell people. There are visions that only a true seer could decode, like “Neoclassic Dinner for Eight to Ten”. I’ve done this safe in the knowledge that most people will never actually be able to get a copy, those rare old books now being collector’s items that go for hundreds of dollars. But this year, 43 years since it was first published and into a general political climate not so different from the 80s in which it was conceived, Entertaining has just been rereleased. It is a new printing for a new generation of culinary fantasists. “Cook remaining 100 lobsters,” Stewart tells us, in one of the most spectacular lines ever written in English, in or outside a cookbook. It is the best, worst influence on cooking any of us could have dreamed.Ruby Tandoh’s All Consuming is published by Serpent’s Tailat £18.99.

I’ve probably in my life tried to close down more zoos than open them.”MPs call for release of 15 penguins ‘trapped’ at London aquariumRead moreHe’s taken up the mantle of keeping the world’s zoos in check at an interesting time, when their role in modern society is the subject of heated debate, with rows about lonely gorillas orpenguins kept in a basementseeming to erupt every week. Keeping wild animals solely for entertainment purposes was socially acceptable some decades ago, but there are now far more concerns for their welfare and the conservation objectives of their captivity. This particularly applies to animals such as elephants, which need large spaces to roam and in the wild have complex relationships within giant social groups.As the new president of the World Association ofZoosand Aquariums, Field hopes he will be in a position to address some of that. Speaking to the Guardian exclusively, he said: “There are many zoos in this country and certainly abroad that I would like to see closed. I think there are zoos in the UK and exotic animal collections that are not achieving the standards we would expect and also are not giving back in terms of conservation and education, and that is fundamentally wrong.”View image in fullscreenTwo African Bull elephants at Noah’s Ark Zoo Farm, Somerset.Photograph: Ben Birchall/PAZoo fans stress their role in conservation. But charities such asBorn Freehave pointed out that the vast majority of species kept in zoos do not have planned reintroduction programmes, and therefore they suspect the animals are kept only for entertainment purposes and “exploited”. A recent report foundnumerous welfare breachesin UK zoos, including animals kept outside in poor weather without access to shelter.The UK government isnow obliging zoosto have a conservation focus, in an update to regulations. Elephants will also need to be kept in larger enclosures and birds of prey must be kept in large aviaries rather than being tethered. Another new rule is a ban on visitors touching fish, rays or cephalopods such as octopuses.View image in fullscreenZoos can play a useful part in rewilding, says Field.Photograph: PA Images/AlamyField, who has loved zoos all his life, first volunteering at Dudley zoo aged 12, then working as a curator of animal collections in Edinburgh, Dublin and London before becoming chief executive of the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland, welcomes these regulations.But, he admits, the bad zoos, which are often not regulated as part of the network Field now chairs, are overbreeding animals. “There are a lot of bad zoos out there which are breeding animals for commercial and wrong purposes. As a matter of last resort, there are times when an animal might need to be euthanised. With lots of forward planning, this can be minimised as much as possible.”Which animals should be in zoos? Elephants? Polar bears? Field agrees it’s a topic of discussion: “Currently there are some new polar bear exhibits in the UK and we are going through a very strong welfare audit. We have some concerns about those down south and we are concerned about the heat.” Elephants also need more space and company than captivity can provide, and Field says that the zoo must be suitable; Whipsnade is “exceptional”, but a zoo such as Edinburgh doesn’t have the space.75 members of parliament recently signed a motionasking for the 15 penguinscurrently housed in the basement of the London Aquarium, where they don’t get any daylight, to be freed. “I think their veterinary and physiological needs are catered for.” Field said. “But if people are seeing an animal in an environment they don’t feel comfortable with, they lose their connection.”One creature which should never be kept in UK zoos, he said, is the orca. “We don’t have anywhere in the UK that could keep orcas,” he said. “The way we keep cetaceans, we need to review and progress. The UK won’t ever be a place for them.”Pandas, however, are a different matter. Field was at the centre of media headlines after the Chinese government took back two pandas, Yang Guan and Tian Tian, who were on loan to Edinburgh zoo. There is controversy around China’s use of pandas in diplomacy and the way the government uses them to exert pressure abroad.View image in fullscreenYang Guan and Tian Tian, who were on loan to Edinburgh Zoo.Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The GuardianField said: “I would have loved for them to have stayed for the rest of their lives. Sadly the contractual requirements around pandas and China and the diplomacy associated meant there was no loophole of any shape or form to have kept them. The way pandas are part of the bigger zoo network does need to be reviewed. I hope as far as my global role [goes], I can engage with the Chinese zoos.”Week in wildlife: traffic-stopping reindeer, wildcats and a giraffe on the moveRead moreZoos can play a useful role in rewilding, says Field. His zoo recently pioneered the release of wildcats back to Scotland, breeding and releasing them in the Cairngorms national park. This pioneering release of carnivores, he believes, could pave the way for zoos to reintroduce big cats into the wild globally.“Carnivores are a difficult one. The science we are doing is feeding into this work for different species. Lynx is definitely being spoken about in the UK, we have previously spoken about leopards, which are on hold at the moment, but there is the amazing Iberian lynx, the Florida panther – this work is going on.”The zoo made headlines again after suspected rogue rewilders dumped lynx in the Scottish highlands. Field had to clean up afterwards, and says the lynx dumping was “evil”.View image in fullscreenField’s zoo recently pioneered the release of wildcats back to Scotland, breeding and releasing them in the Cairngorms national park.Photograph: Peter Cairns/Scotland Big Picture/Royal Zoological Society of Scotland/PA“[The lynx] were so desperate for human care that they opened the traps and they walked in. This is a serious, serious science. It can’t just be done by anyone.”He’d love to see lynx roaming wild again but doesn’t believe wolves have a place in the UK as wild animals, however, and fears the same person might dump wolves.Field is quite clear that zoos can make a huge contribution to society, and warns that sometimes, as in the recent stories aboutthe “lonely gorillas” at Bristol zoo, readers must look beyond the headlines. “We do put our emotions into animals. If I went to smile at my chimpanzees right now they would have huge fear because if you bare their teeth you are expressing fear and anger. Perhaps it gave people a lot of emotion and care for the animals but we need to look behind the shocking headline. In the case of those gorillas I can vouch that they are looked after.”Explore more on these topicsZoosAnimalsZoologyinterviewsShareReuse this content"

Predominant among those sits YouTube, with more than2.5 billion monthly viewers. For people my age – a sprightly 28 – and younger, YouTube is less of an app or website than our answer to radio: the ever-present background hum of modern life. While my mum might leave Radio 4 wittering or BBC News flickering in the corner as she potters about the house, I’ve got a video essay about Japan’s unique approach to urban planning playing on my phone. That’s not to say I never watch more traditional TV (although 99% of the time I’m accessing it through some other kind of subscription streaming app), but when I get home after a long day and the thought of ploughing through another hour of grim prestige fare feels too demanding, I’m probably watching YouTube. Which means it’s very unlikely that I’m watching the same thing as you.When Google paid$1.65bn for the platform in 2006, (just 18 months after it launched) the price seemed astronomical. Critics questioned whether that valuation could be justified for any video platform. The logic was simple – unless YouTube could replace television, it would never be worth it. Nearly two decades on, that framing undersells what actually happened. YouTube didn’t just replace television – it invented entirely new forms of content: vodcasts, vlogs, video essays, reaction videos, ASMR and itsheinous cousin mukbang. The platform absorbed new trends and formats at lightning speed, building what became an alternative “online mainstream”. Before podcasters, TikTokers, Substackers and even influencers, there were YouTubers.I started paying forYouTubePremium during Covid, when I had an abundance of time, and spare cash without the need to commute or the potential of buying pints. Now, it’s the only subscription that I don’t worry about the value of, but rather wonder if I use it so much that it’s changed me as a person. Alas, my gym membership does not fall into this category.The obvious advantage to the premium subscription is never seeing ads, and the smart downloads that automatically queue up episodes based on your habits have been a blessing on many a long tube journey. I’m very rarely bored these days; on my commute now, instead of staring out the window and letting my mind wander, I’m either watching sports highlights or a podcast. I no longer really think about stuff – I just go on YouTube.View image in fullscreenDonald Trump, right, on Joe Rogan’s podcast, which airs on YouTube.Photograph: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBMoPUAeLnYIt’s slightly embarrassing to admit that a random deluge of shorts featuring guitar instructors and teenage garage bands has inspired me to pick up the instrument again – like admitting that you met your partner on Hinge. But that’s the thing – YouTube has democratised expertise in ways traditional media never could. It also fits in with the etiquette around media consumption on your phone. I’d never desecrate a Spielberg or Scorsese film by watching one on a 6in display. That feels vaguely heinous – disrespectful to the craft. But watching behind-the-scenes footage or promo tour clips? That’s exactly what YouTube is for.I watch a mix of YouTube-native creators – Amelia Dimoldenberg’s Chicken Shop Date, JxmyHighroller for NBA deep dives, Tifo Football for tactical analysis, Happy Sad Confused for film interviews – and a steady diet of content traditionally formatted for TV or print but which probably now reaches the biggest audience via YouTube: Graham Norton, Saturday Night Live, even fellow journalists such as Owen Jones and Mark Kermode. And sports highlights exist on the platform in a state of perfect convenience that legacy broadcasters can’t match, especially when it comes to paywalled sports such as cricket and NFL, where watching live requires an immense financial, and time, commitment.However, this convenience and entertainment isn’t without its problems. YouTube’s hyper-personalised algorithm means we’re all watching completely different things. Where previous generations had “Did you watch that thing last night?” as a universal conversation starter, now everyone’s deep in their own algorithmic bubble. We’ve gained infinite choice but lost the sense of shared experience, a shared culture. Even “big” YouTube moments fragment across demographics in ways that Saturday-night telly never did. When politicians – usually, but not exclusively, of the far right – bemoan that we live in a divided nation, they’d be better off pointing the finger at our viewing habits than the immigration figures. My algorithmic delights may well have more in common with a 28-year-old in Bengaluru than the 45-year-old living next door.There is one exception, though it’s not exactly comforting: while YouTube has fragmented viewing habits across most demographics, it’s created something close to a monoculture among young men.Joe Rogan, Theo Von, Lex Fridman and a rotating cast of Trump-adjacent podcasters and public intellectuals, including the late Charlie Kirk, have become a genuinely ubiquitous part of the water-cooler conversation among men my age. YouTube has democratised access to long-form conversation in genuinely enriching ways, but it’s also created pipelines to increasingly toxic content. The platform’s algorithm doesn’t just surface what you’re interested in – it surfaces what keeps you watching, and that’s not always the same thing. It has a tendency to boost extreme viewpoints and fringe theories by taking you on a journey from something entirely harmless to genuinely dangerous misinformation so gradually and organically that you barely notice it happening. And with everyone in your demographic experiencing the same, it’s hard for the community to police itself.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe GuideFree weekly newsletterGet our weekly pop culture email, free in your inbox every FridayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Some of the Dutch club’s internationals were on holiday, seven of their starters from the final would leave that summer and Copenhagen were well ahead in preparations, but even so, the scoreline was bruising. It felt as if Slot had to start all over again.“I can remember it like yesterday,” says Marino Pusic, Slot’s assistant atFeyenoordand earlier at AZ. “The score could have been even higher – that says enough.” Copenhagen’s then coach, Jess Thorup, described it as more akin to “a training session than an actual friendly match”. Two weeks later a stronger Feyenoord side lost 4-0 to the Belgian club Union Saint-Gilloise. Then came home defeats by Lyon and Osasuna.View image in fullscreenArne Slot (left of dugout) digests a 7-0 pre-season battering at home to Copenhagen in July 2022.Photograph: ANP/Getty ImagesAfter Liverpool werewell beaten by Manchester Cityin their most recent game, a scarcely imaginable seventh defeat in 10 matches, it was easy to imagine Slot was grappling for the first time with a slump and a rebuild. The coach’s smooth rise from Cambuur to Anfield, via AZ and Feyenoord, has delivered trophies and awards. How capable is he of digging a struggling team out of a hole?Feyenoord brushed off their summer of strife to win the Eredivisie, and if retaining the Premier League title looks beyond Slot, Pusic believes his former boss has the skills to turn around Liverpool’s season, which resumes at home to Nottingham Forest on Saturday.Premier League: 10 things to look out for this weekendRead more“It was worrying,” Pusic says, casting his mind back to Feyenoord’s troubles. “But once you recognise the cause, you know how to act and turn it around … Throughout the process we stayed cool, no unnecessary emotions. Arne is brilliant at that: he keeps a clear head, analyses things deeply and turns conclusions into action.“No one gave us any chance of winning the league that season. And yet the pieces slowly started to fall into place. We were proactive, brought in the right players – even though we had very little money – and, most of all, did the work on the training pitch, where we could improve and develop the players.”He sees parallels at Liverpool, where Slot is integrating several summer signings: “People often forget that the group dynamic is crucial. Bringing in five or six new players can throw the balance off temporarily. The group only starts functioning properly again once they can find a new rhythm, but before then they go through different phases. That goes beyond tactics or technique; it just takes time for the group to find its cohesion.”The evolution of Liverpool’s squad was overshadowed bythe death of Diogo Jotaand Pusic says the impact will have been bigger than many realise. He dealt with grief within his team soon after he left Feyenoord in 2023 to manage Shakhtar Donetsk. “The brother of my first-choice goalkeeper had died in the war,” Pusic says. “At that moment, you’re dealing with completely different things than football. So much hits you at once.View image in fullscreenLiverpool’s players show their disappointment after going 2-0 down at Manchester City this month – the 3-0 loss was their seventh defeat in 10 matches.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian“Diogo was incredibly important for them, both on and off the pitch. He was a teammate but also a close friend to many players, who could lean on each other for support. And then you suddenly lose that person in such a terrible way. It has a huge impact on everyone at the club, especially the squad. During the season, these things may fade a bit into the background, but they linger, and at difficult moments they can resurface.”Liverpool, as champions, have also had to adapt to a different approach from opponents, Pusic says: “You’re no longer the one chasing but the team being chased. That’s a big difference, also mentally, because you can’t win matches purely through tactics; you also need to win matches based on other emotional elements. The question is how you deal with this within the team. Who takes the initiative now, and who assumes which leadership roles? Those are the deeper layers of coaching, and they’re crucial.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He will have been working on new strategies, which take time to refine, according to Pusic. “If the opponent’s tactic is to play it long and focus on the second ball, then you have to adjust based on different elements. Who engages in the duel? Who goes to the second ball?”Two years ago Slot talked about his methods in Ronald Giphart’s bookHetbeste vanjezelf (The best of yourself), including outlining his detailed video work with players. “I’m constantly thinking about how we can further improve,” he said. “For example, by finding out how our next opponent applies pressure and how we could deal with that … You can’t win a match purely through analysis. Luck has to be on your side too, and everything comes down to fine margins, but from the outset I focus heavily on the analytical side. And on relationships, for example by having individual conversations with everyone.”View image in fullscreenArne Slot helped Feyenoord bounce back to a first league title in six years in 2023.Photograph: Hollandse Hoogte/ShutterstockLiverpool’s poor league start reminds Pusic of one other challenging moment in Slot’s career, during his second season with AZ. They drew their first five games, having finished the previous, unfinished coronavirus season second only on goal difference to Ajax. “That brought pressure with it, as we wanted to compete at the top of the Eredivisie, and it weighed on Arne,” Pusic says. “But it’s not comparable with the scrutiny at the top of the Premier League.”AZ got back to winning ways and Liverpool appeared to have found the way up when theybeat Aston Villaand Real Madridbefore their defeat at City. “Everyone goes through periods like that,” Pusic says. “The question is: what core qualities do you have to get through them more quickly? In that respect, being able to stay composed under pressure is crucial and Arne has that ability.”Explore more on these topicsArne SlotLiverpoolFeyenoordfeaturesShareReuse this content"

For all of the somewhat surreal edge of seeing Donald Duck and Goofy outside garages, the fact Disney has chosen F1 as a partner is indicative of the sea change the sport has brought about in a market it has long coveted.‘I still see title as quite distant’: F1 leader Norris not hedging bets for Las Vegas GPRead moreAs little as a decade ago it would have been unthinkable that an American institution such as Disney would have chosen to hitch its wagon to F1, which was barely even a niche sport in North America. Yet this weekend in Vegas marks the beginning of a two-year collaboration. Mickey and his pals in the Disneyland Band will perform the national anthem pre‑race and feature as part of the post-race driver celebrations at the Bellagio fountains.That the sport and Disney are celebrating here is entirely apt. The streets of Las Vegas, beneath the neon and the roving searchlights, are thronging with race fans. The rain that has swept in this week giving the buildings a clean and the Nevada desert a welcome top-up has singularly failed to dim anyone’s enthusiasm. These fans are the vanguard of F1’s popularity in the US.The sport has justsigned a new deal with Applefor a reported $160m (£122m) a year over five years for the TV rights in the US. It is an enormous investment by the tech company, which believes the sport is now appealing to its audience, while F1 is convinced it is the best way to connect with its new US fanbase. Apple had previously hosted some Major League Baseball and Major League Soccer but a full season of every session of live F1 to all subscribers is on a different level entirely.View image in fullscreenOscar Piastri thunders down the Las Vegas street during practice.Photograph: Clive Mason/Getty ImagesEddy Cue, the vice-president of services for Apple, recently noted that on a dinner with Toto Wolff, the Mercedes team principal, in New York, the Austrian was stopped all the time for pictures. “Five years ago, nobody would know who Toto was as he was walking down Soho,” said Cue. “There’s a huge potential for the sport in the US specifically.”Research indicates that since 2017, whenLiberty Media took over F1, the number of US firms who are sponsors or partners with teams has risen from 44 to 125 this year. That number is expected to increase, particularly with the US marque Cadillac joining the grid next year.At the helm for this resurgence has been the Formula One Group chief executive, Stefano Domenicali, the former Ferrari team principal. The Italian, who had the bravery and commitment to believe a race in Vegas could be pulled off, thinks there is more to come. “The sky’s the limit,” he says. “I want us to have more than a billion fans worldwide and growing our fandom in the US can certainly help us to get there. We believe that once we’ve introduced people to the world of F1, they’ll be hooked.View image in fullscreenElvis has entered the paddock in Las Vegas.Photograph: James Sutton/Formula 1/Getty Images“I am always struck by the American love of their sports and how deeply it is part of day-to-day life. We need to keep evolving what we’re offering to reach a point where we’ve given both avid, existing and new, emerging fans so many reasons and opportunities to watch and hear about F1 that we’ve become part of the US culture.”On the streets in Las Vegas this weekend his vision can be seen writ large. F1 is snaring what is considered the golden ticket in terms of demographics – 47% of new US F1 fans are aged between 18 and 24 and more than half are female. These are numbers cricket and rugby would kill for. They are enthusiastic, with a fervour for the young drivers, coming unencumbered by the baggage of F1’s long and rightly celebrated legacy. Drive to Survive or this year’s enormously successful F1 film starring Brad Pitt might have enticed them in but F1 is delivering to keep them coming back.Lewis Hamilton defends work ethic after Ferrari chief’s ‘talk less’ rebukeRead moreSpeaking to fans at the track, the draw is less about tribal driver, national or team loyalties and more about simply having a good time. They revel in the spectacle, the lights, the show, the music, the food and drink that F1 has made such a point of delivering in Las Vegas as part of what is derided in sniffier circles as “entertainment”. Here no one cares, the partnerships with Disney, Hello Kitty and Lego are welcomed and the associated merchandise sells by the armful.View image in fullscreenDisney-branded Formula One merchandise sells by the armfuls.Photograph: Patrick T Fallon/AFP/Getty ImagesIt reflects a conscious change of direction that has worked so well. “When the sport came to the country previously, we thought we could just turn up for four days, race and everyone would love us,” says Domenicali. “Now we know we must keep engaging with our American fans and US culture until F1 becomes relevant and a part of it, so the biggest thing we’ve changed is how we interact with fans and how we speak to new audiences. We are now speaking with our US fanbase all year round, 24/7.”That this has been a success is manifest in an enormously impressive bottom line, founded partly on F1’s bet on making it in the US, one backed appropriately in Las Vegas by the sport itself promoting the race here. F1 now has a market value of $24bn, a figure that has risen by 25% in the past year and is now three timeswhat Liberty Media paid in 2017. These are numbers fuelled by the business behemoths such as DisneyWith it, of course, has come criticism, not least that the European heartlands of the sport have become marginalised at the expense of growth in the US and the pursuit of Middle-Eastern petrodollars. Yet the drive to expand in the US at least was always perhaps F1’s holy grail. Mickey in the pit lane? Times have changed and it’s Fantasia in Vegas for F1.Explore more on these topicsFormula One 2025US sportsMotor sportApple TV+Formula OnefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Plans to expand the business are intended to lead to more sporting success, but it remains to be seen whether they can take the next step and challenge Arsenal for the Premier League title.Premier League: 10 things to look out for this weekendRead moreArsenal, top going into Sunday’s north London derby, showed their intent when they bought Declan Rice from West Ham for £105m in 2023. Spurs’ record buy is the £60m Richarlison in 2022.Frank is unsure whether his predecessor, Ange Postecoglou, was right to predict last year that Spurs will never spend £100m on one player. “In the next 50 years?” he said. “Then yes.“To build, you need a combination of time and doing the processes. Depending on where the team come from, of course. But to stay up there is still very difficult. So time and ­process, and, then of course, investment.“If you want success in football, you need to invest in players. Hopefully do it cleverly and we want to do it smart so we don’t invest too much on the wrong players. But you need to invest, £100m, I don’t know. Let’s see. I don’t think we are close to spending £100m, put it that way.”Frank considered whether Spurs, who are fifth, would need to spend heavily to catch Arsenal. “I’m a big believer that we need to develop the players we have,” he said. “If you can develop players, not all of them should cost £60m, £70m, £80m, £90m, whatever the amount. I don’t think anybody has done that. ­Liverpool didn’t do that to get to the top. Even [Manchester] City hasn’t done that.“You need to be good at developing the players, which I believe we are. You also need to invest in the right potential of a player. Declan Rice is a good example. How old was he when he joined Arsenal? Twenty-four or 25? That’s important. Nobody achieves the top without investing.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Palmer was close to returning to first-team action after two months on the sidelines, only to stub the small toe on his left foot on a door on Wednesday night.Chelsea, who visit Burnley in the Premier League in Saturday’s lunchtime kick-off, had hoped the 23-year-old would be available for Tuesday’s Champions League tie against Barcelona or next weekend’s home game against Arsenal.“Unfortunately he had an accident at home two days ago and he hit his toe,” Enzo Maresca, the Chelsea head coach, said. “It’s nothing important, but for sure he’s not back next week. The only thing we know is that he’s not available for this week, next week. He’s not available for tomorrow for sure, Barcelona for sure, Arsenal for sure. It can happen. I wake up many times during the night to go to the toilet. I hit my head, my legs, my everything, so it can happen.“He was very close [to a return]. He was almost back after the groin [issue] and that’s very good news. And then again, he had this small problem and hopefully it’s nothing important.”Maresca said Palmer was not wearing a protective boot. “The last time I saw him was yesterday morning, and he was without socks, without flip-flops, he was without nothing. He was working OK. The problem is that it’s a small toe, so the contact with boots can be painful.”Palmer has avoided surgery on his groin and is keen to get back on the pitch after a frustrating start to the season. Chelsea have tried to manage him with rest. But time is of the essence for Palmer given that his place in England’s squad for next summer’s World Cup is on the line. England have heavy competition for places in attacking midfield, although there is confidence that Thomas Tuchel will find space for Palmer.Jacob Steinberg2.Iraola not worried by Semenyo’s futureAndoni Iraola has insisted he is not worried about speculation that the Bournemouth winger Antoine Semenyo could leave the club in January. It emerged during the international window that the 25-year-old Ghana international has a £65m release clause in the five-year contract he signed this summer.View image in fullscreenBournemouth’s Antoine Semenyo  has a £65m release clause in the five-year deal he signed this summer.Photograph: Robbie Jay Barratt/AMA/Getty ImagesHowever, when asked about the much-coveted Semenyo’s future before Saturday’s Premier League match with West Ham, Iraola said: “We are in November. Antoine is our player, he will continue being our player.“In January, you can ask me about the market in January, but right now I’m not worried about the next markets. It’s something that especially you know that I hate to talk about in August, January, the moments when the market is open, but it is not one of those moments. It’s November. ”PA Media3.Kolo Muani boost for Spurs’ derby hopesThomas Frank has been given a major boost for Sunday’s trip to Arsenal with Randal Kolo Muani available for the north London derby.The forward suffered a blow to his jaw in Spurs’ 2-2 draw with Manchester United on 8 November and subsequently missed international duty with France. He joined a lengthy injury list for Tottenham, but Frank provided positive updates on a number of players and Kolo Muani can unexpectedly play after he was fitted with a protective mask in training.View image in fullscreenRandal Kolo Muani will play in a protective face mask against Arsenal.Photograph: Marc Atkins/Getty Images“Pape [Sarr] trained today, ready and available. Lucas [Bergvall] trained today and is available. Kolo Muani, yes trained today, available – of course he has a mask he needs to play with,” Frank said.The defenders Ben Davies and Kota Takai also returned to training this week and centre-back Radu Dragusin took part in a behind-closed-doors friendly earlier this month to step up his recovery after he sustained anterior cruciate ligament damage in January. Archie Gray is another back and Mohammed Kudus, who missed international duty with Ghana, has also returned to training in a further boost for Frank. James Maddison, Yves Bissouma and Dejan Kulusevski remain sidelined along with Dominic Solanke, who has not featured since August 23 and had minor surgery on his ankle last month.PA Media4.Howe hopes goals reignite WoltemadeEddie Howe wants more from Nick Woltemade as Newcastle attempt to kick-start their season after the international break. The Magpies return to Premier League action against Manchester City on Saturday sitting 14th in the table with their domestic form in stark contrast to their performances in the Champions League.Germany international Woltemade, the club’s record £69m summer signing from Stuttgart, scored five times in his first eight appearances for the club. But he has managed just one in his last six and the head coach is hoping the three he scored in World Cup qualifiers against Luxembourg and Slovakia will set the 23-year-old off and running once again.View image in fullscreenNick Woltemade celebrates after scoring for Germany against Luxembourg during the international break.Photograph: Stefan Matzke/sampics/Getty Images“I have to say considering the lack of training time we’ve had with him, I think he’s done really, really well and he’s tried to implement as well as he can what we’ve asked him to do,” Howe said. “He started off really well in terms of goals. I think those goals in the international break will do him the world of good as well.“Confidence is everything to a centre-forward, so I think he can be really pleased with himself. But we have to demand more and we need more from him in the sense that he’s the focal point of the team. It’s such an important position. Everything will come around him in terms of our performance, so there are big expectations on him, there’s big pressure on his shoulders. He’s handled that really well so far. And then, of course, the team behind him have to deliver for him as well and we haven’t done that well enough in the last couple of away games.”PA Media5.Carvalho blow caps Brentford’s ‘tough week’Keith Andrews admitted it has been a “tough week” at Brentford following the news that Fabio Carvalho will miss the rest of the season with a serious knee injury. The Bees’ head coach revealed the Portuguese midfielder, who has made 33 appearances for the west London club since joining from Liverpool in August 2024, sustained an anterior cruciate ligament injury in training last week.“It’s been a tough week for obvious reasons – it’s devastating for him,” Andrews said. “I feel for him. He’s someone who I have a lot of respect for as a man. This season he’s not been given as many opportunities as I ideally would have liked. He knows that. Fabio knows he’ll get support from everybody at the football club during this difficult period.”View image in fullscreenFabio Carvalho sustained an anterior cruciate ligament injury in training last week.Photograph: Mike Egerton/PAIgor Thiago took his tally this season to nine goals in 12 appearances with a brace in the 3-1 win over Newcastle before the international break, seemingly bolstering his hopes of a call-up for Brazil. “He’s so important for us and the way we play,” added Andrews, who will also be without Josh Dasilva and Antoni Milambo for Saturday’s visit to Brighton.PA Media6.Silva does not fear sack as pressure mountsMarco Silva insists he remains “on the same page” with Fulham’s hierarchy as speculation mounts over his future at Craven Cottage. Silva is yet to respond to a new contract offer made by the club this week, with his deal set to expire at the end of the season.“We have been on the same page. Of course we don’t agree on everything – I think in your job you don’t agree on everything,” said Silva before Saturday’s Premier League match with Sunderland. “If you have been achieving great results all the seasons we have been here and sometimes overachieving as well, you cannot do it if you are not on the same page.”View image in fullscreenFulham manager Marco Silva insists he remains ‘on the same page’ with Fulham’s hierarchy.Photograph: Peter Byrne/PASilva was leading the list of top-flight managers in danger of the sack two weeks ago, after his side’s dismal defeat at Everton extended their poor run to five defeats from their last six games. He bemoaned the limited opportunity to put things right, with most of his squad jetting off on international duty shortly after the 2-0 loss at Hill Dickinson Stadium.“It was probably a moment to be together after the last match because we were clear with each other at the end of the game that it was not good enough,” added Silva. “We are ready to go but in terms of preparation it is not the ideal scenario. But it will be the same for our opponents, and we have to be ready to give a completely different answer to the last game.”PA MediaExplore more on these topicsFootballThe talkTottenham HotspurBrentfordNewcastle UnitedFulhamBournemouthChelseanewsShareReuse this content"

They travelled to the north-east on Friday afternoon, leading to a change in routine at the Etihad Campus and an early pre-match press conference in order to comply withPremier Leaguerules and avoid another punitive fee.‘He keeps a clear head’: how Slot’s last slump offers blueprint for Liverpool revivalRead moreAsked how many fines he has previously received, Guardiola said: “A lot. Sometimes I arrive one minute later but the rules are the rules. We are training later and if we train at 12 until 1.30, I cannot be here [at the press conference] in time. The Premier League don’t allow me at 2pm. The club said if I don’t start by 2pm they will fine me or fine the club.“We paid a lot of money as I’m late at half-time, butwhen we played in the Champions League finalthey had a show before the game and they are always late. They have to fine the singers! That is why I decided 9am and the journalists have had their breakfast and will need to take a coffee.”City brushed aside champions Liverpoolin their last Premier League game before the international break. It was an indication that they are ready to challenge for the title after a disappointing campaign last season and are boosted by having only the midfielders Rodri and Mateo Kovacic missing for the trip to St James’ Park. “If we continue the squad fit, we’ll compete every single game and every single competition, I don’t have any doubts about that,” Guardiola said.View image in fullscreenErling Haaland celebrates scoring in City’s win over Liverpool.

Never judge a pitch until both teams have batted really badly on it. You know what they say. Over here you bat long, bat hard, bat short, bat soft. You know what they say, the Ashes in Australia is all about a hybrid maverick production with a fan-first identity.Given the brilliance of thebasic entertainment on day one in Perth, it was easy to forget that England’s Baz-facing tourists aren’t the only setup with a brave new philosophy in play, out there disrupting the norms, and in need, above all, of a decent start.“We’re not going to be stale, we’re not going to be traditional.” Not, repeat not, the words of a fully weaponised Ben Duckett. But the words instead of Scott Young, group senior vice-president of content at Discovery Sports Europe, which is apparently alsoTNT Sports, which used to be BT Sport, for whom this was a first Ashes tour in its current guise.Brydon Carse hails ‘relentless’ England pace attack after thrilling Ashes startRead moreWhich is fine. But what does this actually mean? As with most forms of executive-tier media bullshit it appears to be code for cheap disguised as new (see also “agile”). In practice it meant Alastair Cook out under that hard southern sun on day one of the Ashes basically carrying this thing on his back.Here is Alastair Cook before start of play being made to stand near fans and talk excitedly. Here is Alastair Cook, with no noticeable time in between, suddenly out there carrying the Ashes trophy itself into the middle alongside a small, chiselled angry Jedi elder who turned out to be Justin Langer.Here is Alastair Cook on the mic calling what seemed to be pretty much every ball of the day, so omnipresent you expected to wake from uneasy dreams and find his head next to you on the pillow talking about scrambled seams, or discover him already downstairs making one of those massive American movie breakfasts with waffles and bacon, engineered solely so a sulky teenager can grab a single slice of toast and leave the house with a roll of the eyes while Alastair Cook talks at length about batting tempo.By the end the key takeaway from TNT’s coverage of the Ashes was: here we have a bunch of people making the best of a frankly shonky production. The day kicked off with Becky Ives doing an intro in front of loads of old blokes in bucket hats, a tableau that said hybrid, maverick, intertwined. And also: we can’t afford a studio.View image in fullscreenAlastair Cook and Justin Langer walk the trophy out on to the field on day one.Photograph: Paul Kane/Cricket Australia/Getty ImagesIt turned out TNT did have a podium, a kitchen counter model already lurking warily on the outfield, in which the entire visual identity of this six-week broadcast must now reside, clung to like the bit of boat they paddle off to the shore behind at the end of Jaws.Ives carried it off breezily, given this is the hardest TV debut you’re ever going to get, addressing the overnight diehards of the most beloved but also pissily possessive of sports. Let’s get it out of the way. There will be snottiness toward Ives in particular, most of it just because a new person who isn’t Richie Benaud is fronting up a thing that doesn’t look like it used to.There will be hostility in the internet’s dungeon rooms because the person doing this is 1) from outside cricket; and 2) a woman. The reality is Ives was pretty good. She knows about cricket. She talks fluently and asks good questions. By the end, ranged around the podium with JL, Finny and Cooky it was seamless, easygoing anchor stuff.TNT really does need a good Ashes. This week itlost the rights to the Champions League. Across the whole platform there’s a sense of something being worn thin, from the same old advert break music here, like the sounds that come out of your Bluetooth speaker when you turn it on, to the huge super-trash QR code that kept popping up next to Steven Finn – just off the plane and also excellent – to the way they’re pushing Cook out in front of everything like the last ceremonial horse of some dying cavalry unit.Happily the real star of these broadcasts is always the place itself. Watching Australia from the night-time gloom of England there is always that delicious sense of ambient jet lag. The bleached-out colours. The hard white light. The way everything looks harsh but also soft. Starc and Green are stark and green. It turns out the world really is a rock near a star, half of it in darkness.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSport in FocusFree weekly newsletterOur picture editors select their favourite sporting images from the past week, from the spectacular to the powerful, and with a little bit of fun thrown inEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Mmm. Sorry. Where were we?Before long Mitchell Starc was easing in, all pure lines, elite symmetry, bounce and snap. For all the talk of new things, the same things seemed to be happening out there. Zak Crawley nicked off to the sixth ball of the series, a terrible shot for an opener. Harry Brook made breezy runs. Best of all he looked totally relaxed, carrying off that strange mix of old world elegance and over-caffeinated shot selection.Starc showed Australia they didn’t need the Big Three – the Big One would do | Geoff LemonRead moreEngland seemed to euthanise their own innings out of existence, which is one of those things people will talk about coming back to bite you. Australia is always trying to bite you. Spiders, mate. The size of your head. Mosquitoes like zeppelins.The start of England’s turn in the field was very well called by the commentary team as Jake Weatherald was all but Rory Burnsed by Jofra Archer. And both of the male commentators did a good and very professional job. By the end of this Test perhaps it will even be possible to know their names, or which one is the rugby guy, which the cycling guy. There is already an overload of information in the world. Life is too short to tell the difference, at this range, between Charlie Wangdoole and Bryan Tagnutt.If at times it felt a bit like overhearing Finn explaining cricket to a nice talkative man, then this is not anyone’s fault in the comms team. An away Ashes is the toughest assignment even for the oldest of hands, even when your own company is in charge of graphics and direction and there’s no maverick hybrid guff in the way.The cricket, the energy and some excellent bowling carried the day. And no doubt with enough time we will now begin to crave and miss and get nostalgic about these new names and voices, the podium, Finny and Cooky, who really do deserve a proper lie-down in a darkened room. If it’s any consolation, 19 wickets deep already, you get the feeling Sir Alastair might just be out there with his Allen key dismantling the podium before the end of day three.Explore more on these topicsAshes 2025-26The AshesAustralia cricket teamEngland cricket teamTNT SportsAustralia sportCricketreviewsShareReuse this content"

Ojomoh has been thrust into the No 12 jersey for a first Twickenham start in place of the injured Fraser Dingwall but Maro Itoje believes the Bath centre will flourish against Argentina.Dingwall’s withdrawal with a side strain sustained last weekend is further upheaval for Borthwick, who has already lost Ollie Lawrence, Jamie George and Tom Roebuck since the33-19 triumph over the All Blacks. With Tommy Freeman and Ollie Chessum also injury casualties of the autumn, Borthwick’s ranks have been depleted but Ojomoh has been in fine fettle for Bath this season and impressed on his debut against the USA last summer.Would South Africa look enviously at England’s game? Probably not, but the gap is closing | Ugo MonyeRead moreHis inclusion alongside Henry Slade means a seventh different centre partnership of the year for Borthwick, who may have thought he had unearthed his combination for the future in Dingwall and Lawrence last weekend. The England head coach has repeatedly talked up Ben Earl’s ability to play at centre but has resisted the temptation to move the back-row to midfield, handing Ojomoh, the son of ex-England and Bath flanker Steve, the chance to stake a claim.“He has a bit of a swagger about the way he is around the place, and with the way he plays,” said Itoje. “He obviously comes from a rich rugby heritage family, second generation in his family to be playing for England, so I know this weekend is going to be incredibly special for his family and for himself. I’ve been admiring his play from afar and now I get the opportunity to play with him.“I got a call some years ago, and I didn’t have his number at the time, and Steve [Ojomoh] basically asked me to talk to Max – this must have been four or five years ago. I’d never met Max, hadn’t spoken to him, obviously heard about his son who was coming up through the ranks in Bath, and he asked me to speak to Max and tell him to study, to keep on his education. I was like: ‘Look, how can I tell this guy to study? I don’t even know him; I haven’t met him.’“It would be pretty weird if I’d just called him up and just been like: ‘Stay in school.’ I said I’d do it the next time I see him, but the opportunity didn’t come until a few years down the line when I eventually shared the story with him. But I think he is studying now [Ojomoh completed a business and administration degree over the summer], his dad’s influence is working. I’ve been an admirer of the legacy that his dad and that generation of British Nigerians have done in the England jersey.”England are bidding to round off 2025 with an 11th consecutive win – the only defeat of the year so farcoming against Ireland in February– and the first clean sweep of four November Tests since Eddie Jones’s first autumn in charge in 2016. Argentina were victorious the last time they met England at Twickenham in 2022, however, and Itoje is aware of the threat posed by the Pumas – who have already beaten Walesand Scotlandthis month.The Argentina head coach, Felipe Contepomi, has made five changes to the side that beat Scotland with Tomás Albornoz returning at fly-half and Marcos Kremer coming back into the side in the back-row. The matchday squad features 10 players who ply their trade in the Prem, including Itoje’s Saracens teammate Juan Martín González, who shifts to blindside flanker and the Harlequins winger Rodrigo Isgró.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It was impossible to measure the excitement in a seven-year-old from Norway making his first pilgrimage to Anfield. Inside was the promise of watching his favourite player, Daniel Sturridge, and the rest of a freewheeling side throwing everything at a title push. But as Sindre Walle Egeli and his family reached the turnstiles, the cruelest of realities dawned.“It’s not a good memory,” Walle Egeli says. “We showed up, ready to go, and it turned out we’d got fake tickets. I don’t know what happened, maybe my parents bought from some shady people. It was heartbreaking.”English football has dealt him a kinder hand now. The 19-year-old is sitting in a makeshift meeting room at Ipswich Town’s training ground; outside loom the girders of a new complex that will transform their base next season. His move from Nordsjælland in August, the initial £17.5m fee aChampionshiprecord, was a statement of ambition from both parties. It was the pathway to Premier League football Walle Egeli had craved; Ipswich, despite stern competition, had landed one of the most sought-after prospects in Europe.“I had a lot of different options but this is a special club,” he says. “I knew it was the toughest choice I could make – it’s probably the toughest league in the world physically – but I wanted the challenge. I know I’m going to develop a lot here.”Why the eye-watering outlay for a player with 43 appearances in Denmark and a handful of outings in Norway’s fourth division? One answer is readily at hand. Walle Egeli has just returned from scoring the winner for Norway Under-21s in Bosnia and Herzegovina – “a scrappy one, not my favourite” – and putting another notch in the record books.View image in fullscreenSindre Walle Egeli, celebrating after scoring for Norway Under-21s last year, has one senior cap.Photograph: Sipa US/AlamyNobody, not even Erling Haaland, has scored as many goals for the country’s age-group sides. Walle Egeli scored a six-minute hat-trick for the under-17s and made his senior debut against Kazakhstan last September at a younger age than Haaland achieved. His record is phenomenal and, taken on its own, breeds obvious comparisons.“That’s easy when you’re scoring,” he says. “But I’m not even close to being the same player as him. Of course it’s nice to hear because he’s the best player in the world now, but I wouldn’t compare us. I don’t mind it but I’d never think: ‘OK, I’m better than Haaland.’ He’s a top finisher and there’s a lot I can learn through him.”Besides, Walle Egeli has never been a pure centre-forward. Most of his contributions have come from a starting position on the right. A wand-like left foot, honed during a happy childhood 80 miles south of Oslo in Larvik, has been largely responsible. “It’s come naturally but also with a lot of practice,” he says. “My first football memories are of me, my brother and dad going to the nearest pitch and just shooting with my left foot.”Their father, who passed down the Liverpool obsession, had played in Norway’s lower divisions for Fram Larvik. His brother, Vetle, is two years older and thriving with the nearby top-flight club Sandefjord. The pair played together for the under-21s last week, against Israel.“He’s a left-back, also a good left foot, so there were a lot of battles between us,” he says. “But we know each other’s movements and I know which passes he’s good at.” Any goalscoring combinations in the under-21 team? “Should have been! He gave me a clear open goal against Wales and I missed it. He’s very mad at me.”Walle Egeli played in Vetle’s age group from the start, learning technique had to be king against bigger, older boys. He has become a six-footer with laudable aptitude for the Championship’s endless duels. But size was less helpful when a close-knit, “quite special”, group came through at the local club Nanset.They raced to sign up when Liverpool’s international academy gave a training camp in Larvik. “I spent three days trying to replicate Sturridge’s ‘trivela’ against Sevilla,” he says, laughing. “I was so happy once I finally got it.” It was his first time exposed to English outside an academic environment. His mother, a teacher at his school, helped make sure he stayed focused away from football.View image in fullscreenSindre Walle Egeli grew up playing against bigger, older boys and has felt at home in the Championship with Ipswich.Photograph: MatchDay Images Limited/AlamyNowadays he is fluent, talking with self-belief that never skirts arrogance. It was important to stay grounded even when, having joined Sandefjord’s academy at 13, he found himself outshining players at least three years his senior. He had recently turned 15 when a senior debut beckoned. Playing for Sandefjord reserves against an older Teie team, Walle Egeli scored all of the game’s five goals.“The last one was best. I got the ball from my friend Sebastian Mathisen, cut inside and then … top corner. I still remember it really well. It was probably a little bit embarrassing for them. It’s not like you could take the ball and just dribble past everyone, but I wouldn’t say the level was that good.”Still, it hardly occurs every day. Walle Egeli continued scoring prolifically until being stopped in his tracks. He felt cast aside during his final six months at Sandefjord, having decided he would leave upon turning 16.“Once they found out I wasn’t signing the contract there, they totally froze me out,” he says. Samir Saric, a coach whose influence he cherishes, took pains to keep him engaged. “Samir was great with me. I wasn’t given a GPS vest like the other guys, things like that, but he always supported me. We’d stay after training, even after games where I played zero minutes, and work on finishing.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It just seemed harsh treatment for a 15-year-old trying to find his way. “It shocked me and my family, to be honest,” he says. “It was one of the hardest points of my career and I have some regrets from that time, not even being able to play football. But I have a lot of good relationships there and I’m really happy they’re doing well now.”Nordsjælland beat PSV, FC Copenhagen and others to his signature. Their academy has a breathtaking hit rate and is feted for its pastoral care. “There’s no better place for a young player,” he says. “They really took care of me, made sure I had things to do in my spare time, gave me food, everything. They made it a lot easier. It would have been more difficult if I had gone anywhere else.”When he burst into action last season, his first full campaign in Denmark’s Superliga, another move was inevitable. Nine goals and eight assists were a healthy return from a year in which he felt his playmaking ability kick on; two of each followed early in 2025-26 before Ipswich, who host Wrexham on Saturday, followed up their longstanding interest. He is yet to score but there is no panic. Walle Egeli likes the way, since joining Kieran McKenna’s revamped team, he has learned to take greater joy in teammates’ successes. Like a side quietly beginning to justify their status as promotion favourites, he is visibly growing with each game.View image in fullscreenSindre Walle Egeli feels Ipswich, who play Wrexham on Saturday, are ‘starting to really get into the flow’.Photograph: Joshua Bright/The Guardian“It’s going in the right direction,” he says. “People can look at the goal tally and say it hasn’t gone that well, but those who actually watch the games would say I’m in a very good place now. I’m sure we’re going to be very successful. We have so much talent, so many good players, it’s crazy. Now we’ve had two months together to get to know each other. It can be difficult in the beginning but I feel like we’re starting to really get into the flow.”Family never seem too far away: he loves taking feedback from his grandfather, who watches his games on repeat before calling with advice. It helps, though, that another member of Norway’s seemingly endless production line is also taking the Championship’s hard knocks. Walle Egeli and Sverre Nypan, who is on loan at Middlesbrough from Manchester City, have played for the national youth teams since under-15 level.“He’s one of my better friends,” he says. “It’s very nice to have a mate you can talk to. We share the same thoughts about the Championship, its intensity and how tough it is. We talk before and after our games.” They also compete regularly on PlayStation games such as EAFC and Fortnite.Both have one senior cap. Walle Egeli talks thoughtfully about the lack of real role models in Norway’s national team while he was growing up, save perhaps for Joshua King, and how the past decade’s investment in coaches and facilities is bearing spectacular fruit. There is still time to join Ståle Solbakken’s free-scoring team next summer.“I remember 10 years ago saying I want to play in the 2026 World Cup,” he says. “Now I think I’m quite close. If I play well and do good things here, there’s a good chance.” A reunion with Haaland, who offered helpful tips during that call-up in 2024, would be welcome.Everything, from his raw talent to the expert tutelage of McKenna, is in place for a happy resolution. Walle Egeli’s experience at Anfield had one of those. His grandparents, saddened at the sight of their loved ones returning so disconsolately, arranged tickets to the following month’s game with Swansea. This time it was for real. Liverpool won 4-3 and, to top it, Sturridge scored twice.So what about a perfect hat-trick: promotion with Ipswich, a World Cup with Norway and a Premier League opener at the stadium that once thrilled him? “Three in a row, let’s go for it,” he says. “I think they’re in reach.”Explore more on these topicsIpswich TownChampionshipinterviewsShareReuse this content"

The government should now fix it – don’t hold your breathFri 21 Nov 2025 12.30 ESTLast modified on Fri 21 Nov 2025 13.33 ESTShareImagine a family stuck in a house that constantly floods. The carpets are soaked, the walls damp. It’s always cold, no matter how much they turn up the heating.The family try everything. They promise to replace the sodden carpets and find new, innovative ways to warm the house. Someone with a laptop wonders if AI might be the answer. But no one ever looks upwards and says: maybe we should just repair the giant hole in the roof.Britons are that family – and the giant hole in the roof isBrexit.On Wednesday, Rachel Reeves will deliver her second budget, on which, it is widely assumed, the fate of an ailing Labour government depends. Recent weeks have brought conflicting signals – a rise in income tax rates floated,only to be reversed– but there is one big thing we already know: the country does not have enough money to pay for all that it needs and wants.Every public service you can name is desperate for more cash. Take, almost at random, Britain’s prisons: overcrowded, understaffed and saddled with boxes of paper records, a system so “archaic”, according to the prisons minister, that as many asthree inmates are mistakenly released each week. It’s the same story everywhere, from the NHS to the armed forces: we need more money than we’ve got.Reeves will scrabble around to find a few billion, but none of those efforts will address the fundamental problem, which is that we are poorer than we should be, poorer than we were and poorer than our peers.People are right to ask ‘what is the point of Labour?’ when it can’t agree on anything | Martin KettleRead moreReal wages havebarely risen in 17 years. Of course, the crash of 2008 was a global phenomenon, but we are struggling more than our counterparts to recover: indeed, for nearly two decades, Britain has experiencedthe biggest slowdown in productivity growth in the G7. Reeves and Keir Starmer could see the problem when they arrived in office last year, which is why they made growth their paramount objective. But in Britain that is proving stubbornly difficult to achieve, no matter who is in Downing Street.Of course it is: there’s a great big hole in the roof. This week, the economists John Springford and Andrew Sissons publisheda detailed analysisexamining the roots of the trouble. The UK’s woes, they explain, stem from having too few internationally successful industries: “It means many places have too few well-paid jobs and too little income coming in.”And why might that be? “Since Brexit, [Britain] has beenactively undermining its [own] economic model, which is founded on openness to trade, ideas and people.”Openness is the heart of the matter. Britain flourishes when it is open and trading, and shrivels when it is not. Brexit ignored that core economic reality – a defining fact about these islands – by making the UK less open to trade in goods, taking us out of a single market in which Britain had been in its element, trading freely and without friction to hundreds of millions of consumers. Naturally, and wholly predictably, “Britain has fallen behind peer countries since it lost access”, write Springford and Sissons, with the fall in goods exportsdraining more than one percentage pointfrom GDP each year.The picture is better in services, but even there, for long stretches of the Brexit era, the UK haslagged behind Germany, France, Spain and Italy. Where once we might have relied onthe money machine of the Cityto plug the gap left by a declining goods trade, the finance sector has also been hit, losing its once disproportionately large slice of the market. Frankfurt, Dublin, Amsterdam, Madrid, Milan and Paris have all gained, as London has fallen behind. Incredibly, the capital, once the UK productivity engine that helped the rest of the country make ends meet, is now Britain’s worst-performing region in terms of productivity growth. Given Brexit stripped the City of the easy access to EU clients it once enjoyed, that’s hardly a surprise.Of course, the decision-makers know all this. Last month, the governor of the Bank of England warned Brexit would have a negative impact on the UK economy for the “foreseeable future”. Previously, the Office for Budget Responsibility estimated that our departure from the EU would shrink Britain’slong-term productivity by about 4%.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Play our interactive budget gameRead moreAnd yet, our leaders continue to work around these glaring facts as if they weren’t there – like the family wringing out the drenched carpets, studiously ignoring the hole in the roof above their heads. True, Reeves did at leastmention Brexit as one of the causesof the fiscal bind she finds herself in, adding that the government was “unashamedly rebuilding our relations with the EU” to improve the situation.Would that that were the case. Instead, Labour has made only tentative steps in that direction. The much-vauntedtrade deal agreed with the EUis forecast to yield £9bn by 2040. Better than nothing, but for an economy whose value is measured in the trillions, it’s small change.No, if Britain wants to remedy the ailment that has made it the sick man outsideEurope, it needs to be bolder. Rejoin the single market for goods, urge Springford and Sessions. It’s not as if we want to regulate goods much differently anyway, so any sacrifice of supposed sovereignty is negligible.If that medicine seems too strong, then why not re-enter the customs union? Being on the outside is estimated to be costing us up to£30bn a year, the kind of money that could really come in handy. Admittedly, Labour’s manifesto ruled out such a move, but Reeves was seemingly ready to break her pledge on tax rates – and a U-turn on the customs union would cause a fraction of the political damage. Besides, it could be embedded in a larger argument: that given the straitened times, and the threat posed by Donald Trump’s tariff attack on the global trading system, it is a necessity born of a radically altered situation.The point is, tinkering won’t cut it.Seasoned Europe-watchers explainthat EU officials, many of them shaped by years of attritional Brexit talks, respond to timid, footling proposals from the UK in kind. But if Britain were to be more ambitious, seeking a genuine and bigger reset – putting “more cards on the tableto build political momentum”, as former foreign secretary David Miliband put it this week – then heads of government are more likely to push the Brussels bureaucrats aside and get stuck in, forging with Britain a new deal that could be much more profitable for everyone involved.Again, it is a case that could be made forcefully and that much of the British public would accept – that the world of 2026 is entirely different from 2016, that the old red lines no longer make sense and that Brexit was a waste of money that, now more than ever, we simply cannot afford.I don’t expect Reeves to say any of those things, but she should. Charged with stewardship of the public finances, she needs to point to the obvious source of so much of our trouble.

But what happened to talking up the value of migrants for a thriving economy and society?Fri 21 Nov 2025 11.55 ESTLast modified on Fri 21 Nov 2025 12.05 ESTShareThis is howLabourMPs see it. They face brutal dilemmas and miserable choices. How to manage our asylum system is one of the worst. Through their constituency work, they will have met refugees with tragic stories of war and fear, of terrifying journeys across the world, of gangsters on night-time beaches. But MPs’ experience of hearing those heart-rending stories clash head-on with what they see as political necessity, demanding they block their ears and harden their hearts. A life in politics is not for the squeamish.Wes Streeting, a practising Christian, yesterday writhed whileanswering questions on LBC radioabout the home secretary’s tough plans for deterring small boat arrivals. The flavour of his reply reflected how many on Labour’s benches feel. Confronted with the government’s intention todeport more families with children– ending whatShabana Mahmood saidwas feeble “hesitancy” – he sought a bogus escape by claiming many would leave voluntarily, making forced removals “low”. But when pushed, he said yes, removals must be enforced. Was he comfortable with that? “Honestly? Comfortable? No. But is it the right thing to do for the country? Yes.”The dilemmas are deep, morally and electorally. They affect MPs from “red wall” seats whose vote is being swallowed by Reform; MPs in seats with large ethnic minority populations who are losing to independents; and those in university seats where votes vanish leftwards. All of them have different anxieties about immigration – but all can read the polls. The polling group More in Common finds not just the wider public, but amajority of Labour and Green voters –yes Labour and Green– support much of the government’sDanish-style ruthlessness. “In both language and substance, Shabana Mahmood is much more in line with the median Brit than either the Labour left or Reform,” says Luke Tryl, director of More in Common.His polling finds that on the harshest items, a majority of both Labour and Green voters back these plans: prioritising sending asylum seekers home rather than integrating them in the UK; requiring financial guarantees before bringing in family. A majority of Labour voters, and more Green supporters than not, also support giving refugees only a temporary right to stay; only allowing permanent residency if they speak good English and have a full-time job; and only granting asylum to those personally targeted by a regime, not just fleeing wars. There are59 active, state-based conflictsaround the world, more than at any time since the second world war.All of this shows why, although Labour MPs may hate facing up to it, any rebellion against the home secretary’s measures is unlikely to be seismic. Expect the government to moderate the cruellest proposals but stick to the rest. The new plan would send refugees home when the regime they fled has fallen, though their homelands may never be as safe as Europe. Only 6.6% of the world populationlives under a full democracy. The bill also proposes toextend the waitbefore refugees can qualify for indefinite leave to remain or settled status.While Mahmood’s legislation will pass, Labour should have thought more seriously about how to launch a policy designed to appease this dark strand in the national psyche.Leaving large numbers of migrants in limbo in the UK will hinder social integration, almost undermining the concept of refugee status. People have very different views of asylum seekers awaiting a verdict on the one hand, and migrants beckoned here with visas on the other. But what most people also feel about the positives of immigration went missing this week.The underlying assumption, as in most of this government’s policies, is that public opinion is fixed: the hard right may successfully sway it, but Labour never dares try. Yet if it’s politically necessary to deter small boat arrivals, it’s just as essential to talk up the value of welcoming migrants for a thriving economy and every aspect of society. Mahmood, the daughter of Pakistani immigrants, may be its personification, but this needs repeating daily, to refute racist claims. Of all the apparent foreigners the haters spit at, only a tiny fraction are refugees or asylum seekers. A much larger numberwho come every year areeconomic migrants, because employers need their skills. Keep saying it.The OBR calculates that the higher the rate of net migration,the more GDP will rise. Arrivals on the skilled worker route make anet household fiscal contributionof £12,000, according to the latest figures fromthe government’s migration advisory committee. Employment rates of working age non-UK nationalsare slightly higherthan UK nationals, with EU nationals higher still.A fifth of the NHS workforce in England is made up ofnon-UK nationals, including over a third of doctors in hospital and community services. The RCNwarned on Thursdaythat 46,000 foreign nurses may leave the UK due to the proposed changes to indefinite leave to remain: the rest of the world will welcome them. Yet there are still 111,000 care vacanciesin England alone.Cash-strapped universitiesdepend heavilyon international students for almost a quarter of their income – £12bn per year. International studentsboost export earningsby around £23bn. Key scientistschased out of US universitiesby Trump need a rapid welcome.Because stopping the boats is almost impossible, the impact of these new Home Office deterrents is uncertain. Where are the battalions of skilled processors to check every migrant’s status every two years for 10 or 20 years? Deportations need an agreed, Europe-wide system. The risk is that cutting “net” numbers is easiest by restricting work and study visas, yetonly 4% supportfewer students or workers coming to Britain, according to a poll by British Future. In a long list of occupations, from academics and engineers to care workers, fruit-pickers and caterers, a majority don’t want any particular occupational group cut. People, quite reasonably, want control.Labour points to Denmark’s successin deterring arrivals. What bitter irony that on Wednesday, Denmark’s Social Democrats lost control of Copenhagen to the left, with those tough migration rules partly to blame.Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsImmigration and asylumOpinionLabourMigrationRefugeesShabana MahmoodHome OfficecommentShareReuse this content"

As with everything the man does, the effect was disastrous and totally inappropriate. But rewatching the video, I saw from the president less an example of his usual bigotry and more an attempt at what looked like “OK, kiddo” cuteness that, catastrophically, and before I could nip it in the bud, had triggered a tiny sprig of sympathy.It didn’t last two seconds, obviously. The day after his piggy remarks, the US president sat in the Oval Office alongside the Middle East-based tyrant Mohammed bin Salman and sucked up to him for all he was worth. There was nothing affectionate in Trump’s response to Mary Bruce, the chief Whitehouse correspondent for ABC News and hero of the hour, when she asked the Saudi crown prince about the murder of Jamal Khashoggi – which, she suggested bravely, US intelligence agencies had concluded “you orchestrated” – then informed the Saudi leader that “9/11 families are furious that you’re here in the Oval Office”, and rounded it off with: “Is it appropriate, Mr President, for your family to be doing business in Saudi Arabia while you’re president?” (According to Forbes magazine, Trump’s extended family put through $50m in business deals connected to Saudi Arabia in 2024 alone.)Trump’s explosive rage was well under way before she’d even finished speaking, and the same thing struck one about his language as it always does: that the babyish register of calling someone a “terrible person and a terrible reporter” is more unnerving – more sinister in a booky wook Clockwork Orange kind of a way – than someone who speaks like a functioning adult.TuesdayFor a long time, Vanity Fair mattered and its annual Hollywood Issue was a big deal to those who remember it. Those people may be amused by the decision by its new editor, Mark Guiducci, to feature an all-male line up of actors this year, subverting the usual form and joining the awkward what-about-men lobby group keen to claim underdog status for that half of the population that still makes 19 cents more on the dollar than the other half. (In Britain, the gender pay gap is still going strong, too.)Guiducci presented Glen Powell, Michael B Jordan and Andrew Garfield among others under the exhortation: “Let’s hear it for the boys!” Hard to think of a less enticing invitation, except perhaps one to join related discourse around the “state of masculinity” ignited by David Szalay’s Booker win this month, which has flushed out those pluckytruth-tellers who believemale journeys aren’t celebrated and that women dominate publishing to the detriment of male writers.The fact that, in the past 15 years, twice as many men as women have won the Booker, or that, like teaching, one reason salaries in publishing are so low is because it has historically been a field popular with women, does not, of course, get in their way.View image in fullscreenRFK Jr: so powerfully alluring to Olivia Nuzzi that she blew up her life for him.Composite: AP, AFP via Getty ImagesWednesdayLife isn’t long enough to dwell too much on the troubled journey of Olivia Nuzzi, the former reporter for New York magazine who was fired after what, unfortunately, must be described as a “sexting scandal” with RFK Jr – a man she had profiled for the magazine. I did, however, find myself pausing to read two related pieces this week: a longblog postby Ryan Lizza, Nuzzi’s ex-finance who was also fired – from the New Yorker in 2017 – in which his anger is so fresh it rises from the screen like mist, and the companion profile of Nuzzi in the New York Times.Nuzzi, of course, has a book out – American Canto – and in Jacob Bernstein’s New York Timesprofileof her, I laughed out loud at the reporter’s absolutely noble effort to elevate a story of hideous people doing regrettable things to a state-of-the-nation piece.Bernstein writes: “‘American Canto’ is far more about bearing witness to Trumpworld and about how she believes that warped her, just as it warped the country.” Yes, the centre was not holding, it was a country of bankruptcy notices and public-auction announcements and commonplace reports of casual killings, and a 32-year-old publicity seeker who found a strong candidate for America’s least attractive man so powerfully alluring that she blew up her life for him.“The book, which comes out Dec 2, paints a picture of a nation and a personal life on fire,” writes Bernstein, to which one can only rejoinder: bravo!ThursdayAnd still the endless slide to the bottom goes on for the former Duchess of York, Sarah Ferguson. Her new children’s book was supposed to be published today, postponed from October while the Epstein scandal played out and presumably in the hope that everyone would have forgotten about her involvement by now. Sadly for Ferguson, this has not been the case and this week the book and the publicity tour were cancelled.As this paper reported, Flora and Fern: Kindness Along the Way is a book about “two rabbits learning ‘kindness and community’ during an adventure in the big city” – a lovely message we will never get to enjoy, along with the book’s sequel, in which Flora encounters a billionaire financier who offers to train her as a masseuse, while using a dumb, sex-addicted minor royal as bait, and learns kindness and community along the way.FridayLet’s cleanse ourselves with this: the publication of a novel that took 30 years to write, is in seven parts and unfolds over the course of a single day. The heptalogy On the Calculation of Volume is not, thankfully, by Karl Ove Knausgård, but by Solvej Balle, a Danish woman who against all commercial odds has watched her 30-year endeavour become a publishing sensation, culminating this year in an inclusion on the International Booker shortlist and along profile this weekin the New York Times. As the reporter noted after spending time with Balle on the remote Danish island where she lives, and in a phrase that falls like a balm after brushing up against Nuzzi, Ferguson et al: “She seemed happy not to have won the Booker prize.”Explore more on these topicsUK newsDigested weekDonald TrumpWomenNewspaperscommentShareReuse this content"

What’s the truth?Fri 21 Nov 2025 03.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 21 Nov 2025 12.04 ESTShareIbegan by trying to discover whether or not a widespread belief was true. In doing so, I tripped across something even bigger: an index of the world’s indifference. I already knew that by burning fossil fuels, gorging onmeat and dairy, and failing to make even simple changes, the rich world imposes a massive burden of disaster, displacement and death on people whose responsibility for the climate crisis is minimal. What I’ve now stumbled into is the vast black hole of our ignorance about these impacts.What I wanted to discover was whether it’s true that nine times as many of the world’s people die of cold than of heat. Thefigure is often usedby people who want to delay climate action: if we do nothing, some maintain, fewer will die. Of course, they gloss over all the other impacts of climate breakdown: the storms, floods, droughts, fires, crop failures, disease and sea level rise. But is this claim, at least, correct?The figure comes from a study using thewidest available datasetsto try to produce a global view. The results are, to say the least, surprising. For example, it suggests that even in the hottest parts of the world, more people die of cold than from heat. In fact, sub-Saharan Africa appears to have the world’shighestrate of deathsfrom cold and the world’slowestrate of deaths from heat. The figures suggest that 58 times as many people there die of cold than of heat. While it’s true that in hot places people areless adapted to cold, can this really be so?The paper explains that its dataset “covers 750 locations in 43 countries or territories”. But the only African country covered is South Africa. Nor are there any data from India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Afghanistan, the Gulf states (except Kuwait), Indonesia or Melanesia. In other words, most of the world’s hottest countries are not represented. Nor are most of the places in which healthcare is weakest, either for the population as a whole (as in some African nations) or for the most vulnerable people (as in the Gulf states, where citizens might be well covered, butmigrant workersscarcely at all). This is in no way the fault of the authors – it’s simply a matter of where records are available.The study had to model global trends from places in which data exist, which tend to be richer, cooler countries, where health systems are relatively strong. There’s nothing I can see that’s wrong with the methodology: it’s just that the records are so patchy. As one of the authors, Prof Antonio Gasparrini, told me, their extrapolation “was moderate in some areas, but more extreme in others … in some cases the degree of extrapolation (especially geographical) was huge, and we cannot rule out that the model works less well in some regions”. They are currently trying to improve it. A subject that we, as the main agents of chaos, have a moral obligation to understandlooks on the maplike an enormous hole with a few ragged edges.A paper published in 2020 points out that in large parts of Africa, there isno recordeven of extreme heat events, though they certainly happen. Heat events mean major temperature anomalies, in which large numbers of people could be expected to die. The crucial international disaster database EM-DAT records only two heatwaves in sub-Saharan Africa between 1900 and 2019. They were deemed to have caused the deaths of 71 people. The same database lists “83 heatwaves in Europe between 1980 and 2019, resulting in over 140,000 deaths”.Even the extreme African heatwave of 1991-1992 was not reported in the EM-DAT database. Given that people inAfricatend, as the paper remarks, to have “higher levels of vulnerability and exposure” than people in Europe, is it really credible that fewer die of heat on that continent than on any other?Far from the improvement in data we might expect, there has been a rapid and catastrophicdecline in the number of weather stationsmeasuring conditions across Africa. There are now blocks hundreds of miles wide in whichnot a single stationis recorded. As the climate scientist Tufa Dinkupoints out: “Coverage tends to be worse in rural areas, exactly where livelihoods may be most vulnerable to climate variability and climate change.”This is to say nothing of weatherradarstations, which observe and forecast weather patterns and are essential for early warnings. In the US and Europe, where 1.1 billion people live, there are 565 weather stations, while in Africa, where 1.5 billion live,there are 33, according to the World Meteorological Association. Without weather warnings, many more people die.As for heat deaths, the epidemiologist Prof Kristie Ebipoints outthat even in the US the official estimate, of about 1,200 a year, “is probably at least a tenfold undercount”. The great majority are recorded as heart attacks, kidney failure or other conditions. But epidemiological data show how deaths spike during heatwaves. Heaven knows how much underreporting there may be in countries with much sparser records.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

So far, rich countries havepledged just $788.8mto the UN’s fund.

It’s the reasons why those motherhood-and-apple-pie values don’t always prevail in real life, rather than the values themselves, that are generally too contentious for the carefully apolitical royals. Yet what were once safe, bland nothings are increasingly no longer so – and not just because of the awkward shadow now cast over any royal initiative involving childhood by the former prince Andrew’sinfamous associationwith the sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein.There was something strangely jarring about listening to a princess talk earnestly about the need of children to be surrounded by “love, safety and rhythm” in the same week that Lord Alf Dubs, himself a former child refugee,was denouncinga Labour home secretary’s proposal to remove financial support from families with children whose asylum claims have failed, and ultimately to round up and deport them. (Shabana Mahmood had argued that successive governments’ longstanding nervousness about subjecting families to the same rules as lone asylum seekers risked creating a “perverse incentive” to bring small children across the Channel.)The contrast won’t have been remotely intended, of course – Catherine is careful to avoid political controversy – yet it is uncomfortable to watch the wife of a hereditary monarch-to-be appealing to a nation’s best instincts while a democratically elected government feels compelled to chase our worst. Unlike Mahmood, princesses don’t have to worry about re-election. But something is wrong with a country where politicians seem frightened of talking about compassion or human connection for fear of being howled down; where only queens in waiting have the luxury of sounding as if they actually have a heart.As William moves to Forest Lodge, an era of pushbike royals beckons. Will that save the monarchy? | Simon JenkinsRead moreHow does an institution whose function is to bring a country together function in one that seems increasingly hellbent on tearing itself apart? The Waleses employ more than enough old Westminster hands, including expert policy advisers from the David Cameron, Tony Blair and Boris Johnson eras, to help them stay the right side of the old party lines. They’ve already learned the art of engaging with genuine public disquiet without pushing for specific policy changes – as the princess did recently by highlighting the way smartphones arechanging family life, and as Prince William’s pilot project on showing that it’spossible to end homelessnessis designed to do – even when what they’re talking about are problems you might reasonably expect governments to tackle.“You skirt around edges and see where you can help,” as the then Prince Charlesonce saidof his own approach, whether that meant lobbying a visibly irritated Blair government againstgenetically modified cropsor running the Prince’s Trust with its then unfashionable focus on youth unemployment all through the Thatcher years. (Memorably,Norman Tebbit once snipedthat maybe the prince felt such empathy with the jobless because he didn’t have a proper job either.) The challenge for the king and his increasingly involved heir apparent now, however, is that the royals’ concept of socially useful but generally unobjectionable work was drawn up in a world where some ideas – that the climate crisis is a threat from which the planet urgently needs saving, say, or thatracism has no place in modern society– were a matter of boringly settled consensus. And that world seems to be slipping away.If Reform UK wins the next election, Charles may well end up reading out a king’s speech containing pledges to scrap net zero that we would all know contravened everything he has ever stood for, and immigration policies harsher than the Rwanda scheme he was reportedly overhearddescribing behind closed doorsas “appalling”. While British royals are well used to granting assent through privately gritted teeth to legislation they don’t actually like, what the current generation faces may be a more profound clash of values. Even the otherwise inscrutable late queen couldn’t quite restrain herself fromsticking a public oarin when she felt the integrity of the nation was at stake, during the 2014 referendum on Scottish independence.The new head of both church and state could easily find himself caught in the crossfire between senior clergy who are increasingly vocal in their criticism of Reform’s approach to immigration – “isolationist, short term and kneejerk”, as the archbishop of York put it this summer – and a government with a popular mandate for it; or between his commitment to defending all faiths, Islam very much included, and a prime minister in Nigel Farage who apparently believes that a growing number of young Muslims don’t share British values. And in the event of a constitutional crisis – whether precipitated by a general election result delivering a hung parliament with no majority for any one party, or by something an iconoclastic Reform government tried to do in office – the royals could very quickly find themselves in the public hot seat. If the palace isn’t working through what it would mean to reign but not to rule in such a charged situation, then it should be. Or we may all be in for quitesome annus horribilis.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Let’s remind ourselves of its horrorsGiles TremlettLittle is taught about the murderous, incompetent dictatorship – and now almost one in five young people say Franco was good for the countryFri 21 Nov 2025 00.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 21 Nov 2025 11.52 ESTShareAt first sight, few suspected that Francisco Franco might become a strongman capable of imposing a brutal dictatorship across four decades. He was a short, squeaky voiced army officer with a shaky grasp on non-military matters and zero charisma. Yet he did exactly that, before dying of natural causes in a Madrid hospital,50 years agothis week.Even today, Franco serves as a warning that outward mediocrity is no barrier to the ruthlessly ambitious. Behind the dull facade lay a slippery, clever operator. Franco’s ambition was underpinned by an iron will, a glib indifference to violence and unbounded self-esteem.His admirers and defenders – including some on the newly buoyant far right inSpain, the US and the UK – still claim Franco was never really a dictator, but rather a beloved saviour from communism. They are wrong, but dictators do not emerge from nowhere.“Some important part of every society consists of people who actively want tyranny,” French political theorist Jean-François Revel observed the year after Franco’s death: “either to exercise it themselves or – much more mysteriously – to submit to it.” Franco believed the same: what people really wanted was to see and feel themselves governed, he said.Of course, if Franco had been genuinely popular, there would have been no need for his 1936 military insurrection against an elected leftwing government, or for the half a million dead of the ensuing Spanish civil war. Nor would he have shot20,000 peopleafterwards.Franco grabbed power in a Spain still slumped in post-imperial ennui – a mighty empire having disappeared the previous century. Franco wanted to make Spain great again. He blamed foreigners. They were either stealing Spain’s money, conspiring against it as part of a Marxist-Jewish-masonic plot, or poisoning Spanish minds with foreign ideas: liberal democracy, socialism, communism, and his bizarre bugbear, Freemasonry.His war was deliberately slow and violent behind the lines, accompanied by a bloody purging of opponents in an attempt to “purify” this contaminated Spain. His new Spain also had to be a place of supposedly “virile” men and subservient women, whose rights to their bodies, children, work and property were cut, shelved, or handed over to husbands and fathers.After a vengeful victory, Franco locked Spain into a corset of self-reliance and threw away the key. Autarky was embraced. Foreign capital and goods were shunned. “We have everything we need,” he said.But he was wrong. The immediate result was famine, with people dying on city streets in 1940 and 1945. As he drove on a victory tour through the towns of Jaén and Málaga, people begged at his car window. “Señor Franco, for God’s sake, a piece of bread,” they said. Even Nazi officials in Spain, his allies, complained that a grandiose facade hid the ghastly truth. By backing Hitler and Mussolini during the second world war, Franco turned Spain into a pariah state, but he refused to step aside afterwards. Spaniards sank further into misery.Franco’s conviction that he was both divinely chosen and always right meant he demanded a lifelong term in charge. A British ambassador complained that he lived in a “heavy mist of self-complacency”, blind to his own incompetence. Luck, and a lack of any definable ideology, came to Franco’s rescue. When the cold war started, he burnished his anti-communist credentials and the US rehabilitated him.As a result, a disastrous economy was eventually rescued and forced toopen upby the US and the International Monetary Fund. In the 1960s, Spain was swept into a southern European economic boom that had started long before in Italy and Portugal. Suddenly, tourists were pouring on to Spanish beaches at Benidorm or on the Costa del Sol. Many Spaniards still could not find work, but the money they sent home after emigrating to northern Europe also helped.Franco quietly dropped his most stupid ideas – from founding a new empire to making synthetic gasoline with a “magic” formula – but never abandoned his central aim of making Spaniards tame, obedient and politically apathetic. He invested massively in state terror from the 1936 coup onwards, deployed a strict, Goebbels-inspired press law, and ensured that generations of Spaniards were schooled in a heavily conservative and historically amnesiacFrancoist curriculum. As late as the 1970s, independent political parties, free and fair elections and trade unions remained banned.Franco also infantilised Spaniards, deeming them incapable of governing themselves. The scariest part of his legacy was that so many believed him.When that fear-driven consensus finally began to fall apart during the last decade of his rule, he defaulted back to violent domination. Trigger-happy police, torture, firing squads and even that medieval form of execution, the garrote, reappeared. The latter saw a metal collar placed around a condemned person’s neck and tightened until it snapped their spine or cut off their air supply; it was being used by a western European government on its own citizens,in 1974.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

After all, what happens after the man at the centre of a decades-long dictatorship dies? Power was initially passed to the young king Juan Carlos, who oversaw three years of reforms that ended with a referendum on the democratic constitution that still holds today. Spain remains a vibrant, disputatious democracy.Heroic narratives emerged to explain this. For the left, it was the result of pressure from brave street protesters, students and workers who fought continually with riot police. For the right, it was a sign of establishment wisdom. For Francoists, in the most twisted version of all, it forms part of the dictator’s legacy.And therein lies a problem. At the Madrid copy shop where I printed out drafts of my recent book on the dictator, El Generalisimo, the owner kept insisting that his father claimed to have lived well under Franco. His father remembered, of course, only the economic boom of the 1960s.While promoting the Spanish edition of the book, I have also realised that theproblems describedby María Ramírez about growing up surrounded by silence about the dictatorship are still with us. University students tell me that their high school teachers were still skirting around the subject just a year or two ago. As a father of young Spaniards, that is a huge worry.Ignorance is dangerous. It is not surprising that almost one in five young peoplebelieve his dictatorship was goodfor Spain. The only way to change that is to break the silence and teach young Spaniards what Francoism was really about.Giles Tremlett is the author ofEl GeneralisimoandGhosts of SpainExplore more on these topicsFrancisco FrancoOpinionSpainThe far rightHistory booksPoliticsEuropecommentShareReuse this content"

But these are the risks we must addressFri 21 Nov 2025 09.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 21 Nov 2025 18.49 ESTShareThe idea of serving the public has been baked into the bones of journalism ever since the profession was created.Whether it was quality information to inform the citizenry, or sensationalism and gossip, newsrooms and editors have had the desires and needs of their audiences, noble and ignoble, front of mind.But this relationship is changing in important and dangerous ways – the latest change in 50 years of technology-driven disruption to our media and public life.Let me explain.If you use a search engine such as Google, you will have noticed that in recent times when you ask for information on a topic you are served a neat precis of the main facts at the head of the search results. There are links for further information if you want it, but most people are content with the summary.Becoming an AI-detective is a job I never wanted and wish I could quit | Samantha FloreaniRead moreThe summary is written by artificial intelligence – by robots – which comb the work of humans, including the work of journalists, to compose the key points.That means that fewer people are clicking through to news media outlets in search of the news. So far the trend is small, but everyone expects it to increase. And that undermines media business models. Fewer eyeballs on a media organisation’s website or app means fewer subscribers and fewer advertisers willing to pay to reach the diminishing audience.Let’s leave aside, for the moment, the issue of accuracy of the robot-generated summaries, because most of them are accurate enough. The bloopers are embarrassingly bad, sometimes dangerous, but also increasingly rare.This is because the AI companies – Google, OpenAI and the rest – are signing deals with media companies that allow them to use content written by journalists, including decades of media archives, to train and feed their robots.Most of the big media companies have signed some kind of deal, and it is easy to understand why. Media business models have been repeatedly strained, even broken, by successive waves of technological change.The money on offer for licensing content to the AI companies is almost irresistible. When everyone is doing it, who dares to hang back?Ethical media companies hedge their agreements with caveats designed to give them some control, and to protect their reputations.But that can obscure the underlying mechanism – a breach in the relationship between journalists and their audiences. A transfer of power from media brands to AI brands and their owners.Artificial intelligence is so new, and its development so fast, that only fools would make predictions with confidence. Perhaps there is a bubble, andperhaps it will burst. Perhaps within months a different model will have emerged.But I fear that if the current trends continue, media organisations may quite rapidly move from a business-to-public model, to a business-to-business model.The AI companies will intervene between journalist and audience.It is so much easier to outsource the functionality to big tech, which thus increases its dominance and controlToday22% of Australians pay for news, according to the University of Canberra’s annual digital news report.That suggests some brand loyalty. But 22% is obviously not even close to a majority. Once most households bought a newspaper. Now, quality commercial media is no longer a “mass” business. It is a service for an elite.Those who don’t pay get their information from free-to-air television (still important, but declining fast), social media (still growing) or the many free outlets including influencers, podcasters and political partisans. Some peopleavoid the news altogether. In this country, we can be grateful that free outlets include the public broadcasters, which are widely trusted and hold themselves to standards of accuracy and impartiality.Now more than ever, quality news media brands depend on their relationships with audiences for relevance and financial survival. And yet, in the deals with AI companies, they may be trading away the very things on which that relationship depends.Does it matter if journalists are researching and writing content for use by AI businesses, rather than as a direct service to the public?It very much does.These are the risks.First, most obviously, if the journalism doesn’t serve the interests of the people who control AI, then content may not be published, or may be distorted or suppressed. We already see that happening insome of the search results served up by Elon Musk’s Grok.Second, we lose one of the main benefits of accessing a media site’s webpage, app or channel. You learn about the things you didn’t think to ask about, curated into a package by humans exercising judgment.An AI-dominated model, on the other hand, responds only to questions about specific topics, or what it divines about you from your previous searches. It does not care about you as a fellow citizen.What AI doesn’t know: we could be creating a global ‘knowledge collapse’ | Deepak Varuvel DennisonRead moreThird, if media companies lose a direct relationship with their audiences, they will become more vulnerable to attack. How likely is it that the public would know or care about, let alone rally to defend, a media organisation that had annoyed the government, if the information it had produced was consumed mainly as part of a mashup of multiple sources?And would the sense of public duty and public purpose, which still motivates the best newsrooms and journalists, survive if the direct relationship with audiences was severed or weakened?There is no point pretending that change is not happening, or that it can be avoided. But the risks need to be addressed.Media organisations need to get into the game, protecting their brand by delivering high-quality content. They need to make that content, including their archives, easier to search. They should offer subscribers their own in-house question-and-answer robots. This is already happening in many media organisations, but probably not fast enough.It is so much easier, when budgets are strained, to outsource the functionality to big tech, which thus increases its dominance and control.Perhaps the world’s public broadcasters could collaborate to build their own AI engines, trained on factchecked material, and remaining in public hands.Or perhaps the audience will grow dissatisfied with the mashups and the impersonal voice.Perhaps people will value, and pay for, the original, the textured, the in-depth. The interviews and the observation and the bearing of witness that forms the heart of journalism.We should hope so.The relationship between journalist and audience is key to trust, to robustness, to the ability to bring attention to uncomfortable issues and unwelcome news.It is crucial to the idea of the public, and the public interest.We lose it at our peril.Margaret Simons is an award-winning freelance journalist and author.

Lessons must be learnedEditorialThe latest report on the pandemic shows that grave failings were not limited to Boris Johnson. The government needs to prepare for the next crisisFri 21 Nov 2025 13.30 ESTLast modified on Fri 21 Nov 2025 13.49 ESTShareAll four of the UK’s governments are criticised in thelatest reportfrom the public inquiry into the coronavirus pandemic of 2020-22. The Northern Ireland Executive’s response is judged to have been marred by political divisions. In Scotland,Nicola Sturgeondid not involve cabinet colleagues enough in decision-making (though she is also described as serious and diligent). In Wales, Mark Drakeford’s government mirrored some of the errors made in London, particularly when it delayed the introduction of new restrictions in the autumn of 2020.But rightly, given its responsibilities, size and resources, as well as its record, the UK administration led by Boris Johnson comes in for the biggest share of blame. Some of Heather Hallett’s findings regarding the political governance of the crisis are already familiar. Nothing in this report will damage the former prime minister’s reputation as much as what is already known aboutlockdown-breaking social gatheringsin 2020 – or the fact that he misled parliament about them.The contribution of his adviser,Dominic Cummings, to a “culture of fear” in the civil service, is news to no one. But the portrait of an administration not only “toxic” and out of its depth, but disastrously complacent, is damning. To the bereaved families who campaigned for this inquiry, the events of February 2020 – when the PM went away for half-term and did not receive daily briefings, or meet with his cabinet – are unforgivable. The report calls this “a lost month”.Equally disturbing are conclusions about the Department for Health and Social Care. While Matt Hancock, the secretary of state during the worst period, has left parliament, his most senior official, Sir Chris Wormald, now heads the civil service. Mr Hancock gained a reputation among top advisers for misleading statements (before having to resign after breaking distancing guidelines by kissing an aide). Helen MacNamara, the deputy cabinet secretary, described his“nuclear levels” of confidence.Sir Chris, as permanent secretary, ought to have offered a corrective. Instead, the inquiry heard evidence that he was still resisting lockdown measures as late as 15 March 2020. The department will face further scrutiny when the pandemic’s impact on care homes, where there were 45,632 Covid deaths, is analysed in a later report.For families, and anyone else interested in the Johnson government’s record, this report is a milestone in their efforts to get at the truth. They want those responsible to be held accountable, and believe Mr Johnsonshould lose the privilegesand allowance granted him as a former PM. But while the priorities of Mr Johnson’s Brexit-focused government, and his flawed character, clearly hampered the response to Covid-19, it would be folly to assume that the problems exposed by the pandemic have since been fixed.The inquiry is ongoing and not immune from criticism itself. Paul Johnson, a former chief of the Institute for Fiscal Studies thinktank, is among those who havequestioned its length, cost and remit. But the UK’s fundamental unpreparedness for the pandemic, despite repeated warnings, combined with adeficit of scientific understandingin government – for which expert advice could not make up – must be confronted. Emergency planning is a core responsibility of government. It is not enough to establish precisely what previous incumbents got wrong. It is essential to use that information so that their successors do better when the next major crisis strikes.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

It’s not just that disabled actors are discounted for many roles. As actors and activists have pointed out,“blacking up”might have become taboo, but“cripping up”is still a shoo-in for awards. In almost 100 years, only three disabled actors have won an Oscar, compared to25 able-bodied actorswho have won for playing disabled characters.The arrival this weekend ofWicked: For Good, the second part of a prequel story to The Wizard of Oz, has put the importance of authentic casting in the spotlight once more. The story of green-skinned witch Elphaba, and the prejudice she faces, Wicked is a celebration of difference. Yet since the hit musical opened in 2003, only able-bodied actors had played the part of Nessarose, Elphaba’s disabled sister. Last year,Marissa Bodebecame the first wheelchair-using actor to take the role, in part one of the film adaptation. The child Nessa is also playedby a wheelchair user. The movies give the character greater agency and complexity, amending a scene that suggested she needs to be “fixed”.Audiences have some way to go too: Bode previouslychallenged“gross and harmful” comments made about Nessa online. But above all it is the industry that must be fixed. According toa recent study, only 21% of disabled characters on US TV between 2016 and 2023 were played by disabled actors. Screenwriter Jack Thorne addressed the problem in British TV in his2021 MacTaggart lecture, arguing that not only do the stories, and the people telling them, need to change, but also the studios, the majority of which are “still inaccessible”. Show business makes anything possible: animals can speak, emerald cities dazzle and girls fly. But the logistics of getting a wheelchair user on stage or set (supplying basic facilities liketoilets) has been considered too tricky, expensive, or unimportant.In 2020, disabled campaignerscondemnedan adaptation of Roald Dahl’sThe Witches, which showed the characters with three fingers on each hand, for presenting physical disability as a manifestation of moral depravity, and something to be feared. Daniel Craig’s James Bond eschewed 007’s misogyny and embraced paternal instincts – yet there was no attempt to rethink Ian Fleming’s use of facial difference to signify villainy.But problematic classics can be rebooted effectively. The BBC’s adaptation of Enid Blyton’s much-loved girls boarding school seriesMalory Towersstars a genuinely diverse cast, includingBeau Bradfield, who has a visible difference,andEllie Goldstein, who has Down’s syndrome; their differences are not part of the storyline. By the timeGoldsteinappeared on Strictly Come Dancing (which has arguably done more to bringdisability to mainstream TV than any other show) this year, she already had a strong fanbase among young viewers.Amid an alarming pushback against inclusivity – one critic dubbed Wicked’s Shiz University“a woke Hogwarts”– authentic casting is more vital than ever. Director Jon M Chu hasdescribedThe Wizard of Oz as “the great American fairytale”. In Wicked: For Good he has redefined that fairytale. The Broadway stage production of Wicked has followed the film’s example and cast itsfirst ambulatory wheelchair user as Nessarose. Bode has called for disabled people to be hired as writers and crew members too, helping to ensure the narrative truly changes. As Elphaba sings: “Everyone deserves the chance to fly.”Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Pope Francis inspired our parish deanery group to apply for and support a Syrian family to come to Britain and establish themselves. In our area, support came from many unforeseen sources and appeared unanimous as people came together in a spontaneous act of welcome. It’s what Britain can be about.David MurrayWallington,LondonI am horrified and appalled by the new proposals on asylum. I could write a book about what is wrong with them, but I will say this to give food for thought. My husband and I have paid the university fees for a former asylum seeker who has been here for more than 20 years, but still doesn’t have indefinite leave to remain (ILR) and could not access student finance. She is about to graduate with a first-class degree and will make an excellent addition to the staff of our local children’s hospice, where she has been working as a nurse assistant since being granted leave to remain on the 10-year route, where the visa must be paid for and renewed every 30 months.She has struggled financially, and juggled studying and working at the hospice with bringing up two children as a single mum and caring for her sister who has stage four cancer. She put off applying for ILR because she couldn’t afford it. We are so proud of her.Many refugees are keen to work in the caring professions and imposing limbo of 20 years will deprive us of their potential to contribute towards a country that needs them in the workforce.It is a simple matter of economics as well as being broad-minded and broad-shouldered enough to have the compassion to support people whose only wish is to settle down and live in peace.Lucy LucyFormer chair, Dash – Destitute Asylum Seekers HuddersfieldTwo volumes of the Yearbook of the Research Centre for German and Austrian Exile Studies (volume 23 – 2024 andvolume 24– 2025)were launchedthe day afteryou published your editorial (17 November) and Diane Taylor’s article (Labour’s asylum plans are horribly cruel – but they’re also a mix of hype, old policy and unachievable promises, 17 November). The centre, led by Prof Charmian Brinson, has been working on the legacies of policies for asylum seekers, exiles, migrants or refugees from Nazism for more than 25 years. It has published numerous reports from those seeking refuge and their offspring.My father’s life was plagued by antisemitism and Nazism, and becoming a refugee. In concluding her introduction to the launch, Prof Brinson quoted the closing sentence to my essay in volume 24. It is equally relevant as a critique of Shabana Mahmood’s proposals for asylum seekers, as many attending the launch attested: “The lesson of this surely is that we should try, as best we can, to make sure that refugees’ lives are made as good as they can be and not blighted by the scars of war and crimes against humanity, let alone racism and discrimination of any kind.”Miriam E DavidProfessor emerita of sociology of education, UCL Institute of EducationI cancelled my membership of the Labour party after reading this article (Asylum seekers’ jewellery could be seized to pay for processing costs, says Home Office minister, 17 November).In his desperate – and futile – efforts to woo Reform UK voters,Keir Starmerappears to have forgotten the need to keep his core supporters on side. We’re not all depraved, hate‑filled ghouls.Some of us still have compassion for those who have escaped the most heinous of circumstances. And some of us would still like to feel a little pride in how our country helps those who are less fortunate.Dr Rachel McNultyRamsgate, KentWhat’s dividing the country isn’t the asylum system, it’s the fact that politicians across the spectrum are constantly telling us how terrible it is (Asylum system in UK ‘out of control’ and dividing country, home secretary says, 16 November). There’s about one person seeking asylum for every 650 people in this country.Most of us would be completely unaware of this apparently massive “pressure” this is causing, if politicians didn’t keep telling us that it’s dividing us. There are local problems where asylum seekers are housed in unsuitable accommodation with nothing to do – fix that by all means. Clear the application backlog by resourcing the Home Office properly and stop the arrival of people on boats by enabling the processing of applications in France. Stop banging on about how broken it is.Mark WalfordLondonSteve Reed, the communities secretary, asks: “What kind of system is it if it has within it incentives that encourage parents to put their child on such a perilous journey on the open seas?” Could it be a system that has deliberately closed off all the safe and legal alternatives (Asylum changes seek to use children as a weapon, says Labour peer Alf Dubs, 18 November)?Katy JennisonWitney, OxfordshireThose wishing to find out more about some of the very troubling impacts of the harsh Danish asylum system should see the Guardian’s May 2022 documentary,Sending Aya Back, which is on its website.Joe CurranDublin, IrelandHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Tolerating poor care and refusing to learn seem to be shared features of health scandals, including the treatment of people with learning disabilities, such as our own beloved daughter,Juliet Saunders, who died aged 25.She died because the local hospital made a misdiagnosis and discharged her unsafely. The harrowing experience of the inquest was softened for us by the coroner seeing that Juliet was dearly loved and happy. The inquest exposed a series of systemic failings and clinical errors. The coroner rejected the trust’s own investigation,finding that neglect had contributed to Juliet’s death, and issued a PFD with eight recommendations.The trust resisted, claiming that, being non-verbal, Juliet was hard to treat. Would there have been any improvements without the PFD? We were dismayed to find that there was no legal enforcement of the promised measures.People with learning disabilities are over three timesmore likely to diefrom treatable causes (avoidable by proper healthcare) than the general population. The avoidable death rate isnearly double. Having seen how the NHS protects itself, rather than vulnerable patients, we wholeheartedly believe that PFDs should be legally enforced.We want no one else to die as Juliet did, nor for any other parent to suffer the same grief. That her death could have been avoided adds extra cruelty. We share this with all victims of healthcare scandals.Christine and Francis SaundersRomford, EssexHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

We do not own forests or sawmills, and we do not decide what areas are approved for harvesting.The vast majority (81%) of our Canadian fibre came from sawdust and other sawmill residues created when sawmills produce wood products used in construction and other industries in 2024. The remaining 19% of our fibre came from forest residues, including low-grade roundwood, tops, branches and bark.Forests in British Columbia are harvested for lumber by timber companies under strict regulations set by the province’s government in joint decision-making with indigenous First Nations. Around 94% of the province’s forests are on public land, and it is a legal requirement for these sites to be reforested in a free-growing condition. Leaving Canada’s forests unmanaged is not the answer to preserving these landscapes. Wewitnessed this in Jasper, Albertalast year when a wildfire on unmanaged land led to$880min damages and significant amounts of CO2released into the atmosphere.The fibre highlighted in Stand.earth’s report was low-grade roundwood, which was rejected by sawmills following approved harvesting. Without the biomass sector using this harvest residue, it would likely be controllably burned on site to help mitigate wildfire risk. It is far better to positively use this residual fibre to generate renewable electricity. None of the fibre highlighted in this report came from a designated old growth management area or old growth deferral area.Miguel Veiga-PestanaChief sustainability officer, Drax Group plcThe UK has a hard-won reputation for global forest protection, thanks to its leadership when it hosted COP in 2021. It is a bitter irony that in the run-up to a climate conference hosted in the Amazon, the UK government has signed a new contract to pay billions in subsidies to Drax (Drax power plant to go on earning ‘over £1m a day’ from burning wood pellets, 5 November). Drax burns millions of tonnes of trees every year, with reporting in this newspaper showing it is still burning trees over 250 years old from Canada.While claiming to still be a forest leader, the UK spends billions supporting an industry that harms them. This contradiction exposes the government’s hollow claims of environmental leadership. Burning imported biomass is no credible climate solution; it simply shifts emissions and destruction elsewhere.If Britain truly wants to lead on nature and climate, it must stop financing forest loss under the guise of “green” energy and reclaim the mantle of forest leadership to protect ecosystems. Public money should restore and preserve forests – not reward those who destroy them.Matt WilliamsSenior forest advocate for NRDC (Natural Resources Defense Council)Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Why big bows are everywhere – feminine, ironic and strangely subversive, 18 November). I read it just after teaching a seminar on Elizabethan virginity, and I couldn’t help but think of the famous Armada portrait.The painting is an overt celebration of martial victory, with Spanish ships floundering in the view above Elizabeth’s right shoulder, British ships sailing triumphant on the left, her hand firmly placed on a globe. But she is also covered in pink bows, and a huge pearl hangs from a delicate white bow at the top of her skirts, symbolic of her virginity.If men wearing bows on the red carpet is today considered an “alpha move”, Elizabeth I got there first.Dr Charlotte PotterGeneva, SwitzerlandMorwenna Ferrier’s article on big bows being everywhere made me wonder whatEsme Young, one of the judges on The Great British Sewing Bee, would make of all this. Contestants regularly refer to the fact that “Esme likes a bow”. They are indeed a way to “zhoosh something up”.

This conclusion is supported by leading health authorities, including the American Academy of Pediatrics, the California Department of Public Health, the World Health Organization, and leading research institutions.“The increase in autism diagnoses reflects improved screening, broader diagnostic criteria, and greater awareness – not a link to vaccines. The spread of this harmful myth stigmatizes members of the autism community and their families.”Explore more on these topicsRobert F Kennedy JrUS healthcareUS politicsVaccines and immunisationAutismnewsShareReuse this content"

We will get justice for the survivors.”Democrats on the investigative committee appear to have few options to compel Mountbatten-Windsor to talk. As the minority party, they lack the power to issue subpoenas, and the Republican chair James Comer has not commented on if he would take such a step against the former prince.Even if one was issued, Mountbatten-Windsor – who has strongly denied wrongdoing – could avoid the legal penalties for non-compliance by not coming to the United States.The lawmakers issued their statement days after Donald Trump had signed into law the Epstein Files Transparency Act, which will compel attorney general Pam Bondi to release documents related to the government’s handling of his case within 30 days.Trump, a one-time friend of Epstein, tried to stop the bill from moving through Congress, but backed down when it appeared clear ithad the votesto pass the House of Representatives. However, the law includes exemptions for the release of documents that could undermine national security and jeopardize investigations.Critics have accused Bondi of being a Trump loyalist who has used the law enforcement agency’s powers to protect the president and retaliate against his allies. Last week, she announced that she wouldinvestigate tiesbetween Epstein and Democrats, shortly after Trump demanded she do so.In a letter to Bondi on Friday, Garcia wrote that “politically motivated investigations are not a legitimate justification for withholding or redacting records” under the newly passed law.“There is already a concern president Trump will attempt, on dubious legal grounds, to exploit a provision which allows [the] DoJ to withhold information relevant to ongoing investigations,” Garcia said, echoinga concernexpressed by Republican senators this week.He also noted that the committee is awaiting the justice department’s response to a subpoena they issued in August for documents related to Epstein, which Garcia said can be shared in their entirety with lawmakers, even if they are involved in an investigation.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst ThingFree daily newsletterOur US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

These include interview transcripts, court documents and emails, as well as records from the investigation that led to Epstein’s 2008 guilty plea to sexual abuse charges in Florida, and the sex trafficking investigation that led to his 2019 arrest in New York, sources said.As he campaigned to return to the White House last year, Trump, alongside his allies, made statements indicating that there was more to be revealed about Epstein and his ties to global elites.But in July, the justice department and FBI released a memo saying that they had no further information to share about his activities or relationships, while concluding that his death was a suicide, despite conspiracy theories to the contrary.The announcement sparked an uproar among Trump’s supporters, leading to a drawn out congressional campaign to force release of government files related to the case that culminated in this week’s passage of the Epstein Files Transparency Act.Explore more on these topicsJeffrey EpsteinUS politicsAndrew Mountbatten-WindsornewsShareReuse this content"

She only learned that Fox planned to release a podcast with her name attached the day before the announcement, when her team received an invitation to appear on Fox & Friends the following day, her reps toldRolling Stone. Her team added that she never gave permission for the original audiobook – The Truth and Life Dramatized Audio Bible,released in 2010 and acquired by Fox News Media via a licensing deal with a company called Gulfstream Studios – to be repurposed into a new podcast.Reps for Cox, McDowell and Rhys-Davies confirmed to Rolling Stone that they were similarly shocked by the news, with some only learning of the new podcast as news of Bell’s confusion circulated on Thursday. “Brian recorded audio for a project over a decade ago,” a rep for Cox said in a statement. “He was unaware that the audio would be repurposed for a new podcast series in 2025. Brian only became aware of the podcast today.”A spokesperson for McDowell said that the team “found out about it when everyone else did. We were never consulted, nothing was renegotiated, and we would not have approved.” A rep for Rhys-Davies said the actor learned of the “repurposed” project earlier this week.Rolling Stone also obtained a note from a producer associated with the new podcast at Fox, in which they requested a celebrity cast member “not mention that this audio New Testament Bible was produced years ago, we’d like it to feel like something that was produced more recently”. According to the magazine,Fox Newsrepurposed the 15-year-old, 23-hour audiobook into a multi-part podcast series with new additions from Earhardt.While some actors purportedly involved with the new podcast have spoken openly about their Christian faith, others have been critical of Fox News or the closely associated Trump administration. Cox has previously referred to the rightwing news network as “the devil”.A spokesperson for Fox News told Rolling Stone that “Gulfstream Studios produced The Life of Jesus Podcast from The Truth and Life Dramatized Audio Bible, which was licensed by Fox News Audio, with full cooperation and participation by all the actors involved”.The new podcast is part of a larger push by Fox News Media into Christian-themed programming, as it tries to lure more subscribers to its Fox Nation subscription service. “I think there is an insatiable appetite among a very passionate audience that is underserved,” Jason Klarman, the chief digital and marketing officer at Fox News Media, toldVarietythis week. Earhardt previouslyhelped launchFox Nation with a Bible study program.The Life of Jesus Christ Podcast is set to launch on 30 November tied to the Christian calendar, with 13-episode installments dropping at the start of the Advent, during Christmas week, the beginning of Lent and Palm Sunday.Explore more on these topicsBrian CoxPodcastsFox NewsFoxChristianityReligionnewsShareReuse this content"

He continued: “I’m not going to get into my specific security arrangements, but it would be irresponsible for me not to consider that [Trump’s] words result in increased threats to myself, even to my staff, to my family.“It would be a rather irresponsible thing for us not to consider this seriously.”The Arizona senator’s remarks came after he appeared in a video on Tuesday alongside five other federal Democratic lawmakers who have previously served in the military or in intelligence roles – and who all told active US service members that they should refuse illegal orders.“Our laws are clear,” the senators and US House members in question say in the video. “You can refuse illegal orders. You must refuse illegal orders. No one has to carry out orders that violate the law or our constitution.”Trumpreacted furiously to the video, writing on his Truth Social platform that Kelly and the others had engaged in “SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR, punishable by DEATH”. The president also reposted another Truth Social user who wrote, in part, “HANG THEM”.Active military members in the US – whose oath is to the constitution rather than the president – can indeed face execution for the crime of sedition. Civilians, meanwhile, can be fined and imprisoned for up to 20 years for seditious conspiracy.The US Manual for Courts-Martial in any eventstatesthat the military requirement to obey orders “does not apply to a patently illegal order, such as one that directs the commission of a crime”.Generally, allies of Trump have supported his response while his philosophical opponents have lambasted it.Kelly on Friday criticized Trump’ by alluding to howGiffords– whom he married in 2007 – was seriously injured in a January 2011 shooting at a constituent meeting in Tucson in which six people died.Outrage after Trump accuses Democrats of ‘seditious behavior, punishable by death’Read moreHe also referred to thetwoassassinationattemptsTrump survived while successfully running for a second presidency in 2024. Those attempts on Trump’s life preceded thefirebombingof the official residence of the Pennsylvania governor, Josh Shapiro, the fatal shooting of the former Minnesota state house speakerMelissa Hortmanand the slaying of the conservative political activistCharlie Kirk– all between April and September.“My family has suffered from political violence,” Kelly said on Morning Joe. “My wife … was nearly assassinated – shot in the head at a political event. We have rising political violence in this country, even the president – two assassination attempts. He should understand that.”The retired astronaut and US navy member won his Senate seat in November 2020, when Trump’s first presidency ended in defeat toJoe Biden.Trump addressed his supporters before a 6 January 2021 congressional session meant to certify Biden’s victory and – among other things – told them to “fight like hell”.Many of Trump’s supporters thenattacked the US Capitolwhile unsuccessfully demanding the hanging of his vice-president at the time,Mike Pence, who had indicated he intended to fulfill his duty of overseeing the certification of Biden’s election win.The attack on Congress – which was linked to several deaths, including the suicides of law enforcement officers who defended the building – delayed the certification session by several hours but ultimately did not impede Biden’s presidency.Then in January, in one of his first acts after retaking the Oval Office, Trump pardoned or commuted the sentences of all linked to the Capitol attack.Kelly on Friday said Trump’s “words have significant weight with the American people”.“People react to things that he … says,” Kelly added.Explore more on these topicsUS SenateDonald TrumpUS politicsGabrielle GiffordsnewsShareReuse this content"

Prescott left that role in the summer.Banerji cited what he called “governance issues” at the top of the corporation. In a letter seen by BBC News, he said he had not been consulted about the events leading up to the departures of Davie and Turness.It will be seen as a criticism of the BBC’s chair, Samir Shah, and follows anger inside the corporation over the handling of Prescott’s memo, which made complaints of systemic bias in coverage ofDonald Trump, Gaza and transgender rights.Some even considered the pressure over the Prescott claims to be part of “a coup” by the political right to influence the BBC’s reporting. Shah has dismissed such claims as fanciful.Banerji’s resignation, however, will focus more attention on the role of Robbie Gibb, the BBC board member who has faced accusations of repeatedly raising issues of liberal bias within the organisation.Sir Gibb was previously Theresa May’s communications chief and has described himself as a “proper Thatcherite Conservative”. Boris Johnson placed him on the BBC board and the last Conservative government gave him a new term shortly before the general election.Banerji’s departure is significant because he was often seen as a counterweight to complaints from Gibb and others of bias. His departure means the BBC is even more depleted as it heads into the process of finding a new director general.Some BBC insiders have pointed to an alignment between Gibb’s concerns and those of Prescott. It had been reported that the pair were friends, but the Guardian has since established that Gibb was on a panel that handed Prescott his advisory role. Prescott has said his concerns “do not come with any political agenda”.The board-level resignation comes as the two men prepare to appear before MPs on Monday as the Commons culture, media and sport committee attempts to learn more about the events that led to Davie’s resignation.Prescott’s memo was handed to the BBC board weeks ago and was leaked to the Daily Telegraph, which reported its contents over several days.It included concerns about anedit of a Donald Trump speech on Panorama. The US president has since threatened to sue, potentially for billions. Shah, however, has also said Prescott’s memo was a partial and personal account of BBC discussions and did not reflect a full picture.MPs, BBC staff members and Bectu, the main BBC union, have called for Gibb to be removed from the BBC board over allegations of political interference.Friends of Gibb have said he is a defender of the BBC and acts out of genuine concern for its impartiality. The broadcaster has said he is only one of many voices on the BBC’s board.A BBC spokesperson said: “Shumeet Banerji today notified the BBC board of his resignation. Mr Banerji’s term on the board as a non-executive director was due to end at the end of December and we thank him for his service.“The search for a replacement is already well under way and we will update further in due course.”Explore more on these topicsBBCnewsShareReuse this content"

They overstayed in breach of immigration rules, but successfully applied for ILR under the Windrush scheme in 2019.Hippolyte applied to the Windrush scheme in August 2020 and was refused in February 2021 because she had not been continuously resident in the UK since arriving in the country, the court heard.She made a further application for ILR in December 2022, which was refused in April 2023. She took legal action to challenge this decision.Responding to the ruling, Hippolyte said: “I’m delighted by the court’s decision and I am so grateful that the right outcome has happened. I feel that justice has been served.”In a written ruling on Friday, Lord Justice Singh said: “It seems to me the judge nowhere addressed the core point … which was that [Hippolyte] had sufficient close ties to the UK that she fell within the ‘spirit’ of the Windrush scheme even if she did not strictly fall within its exact terms.”However, he added that the appeal court’s decision did not mean that Hippolyte would necessarily succeed in her application.“The reality is that she does not qualify under the terms of the Windrush scheme policy,” he said, but the respondent must consider exercising discretion conferred by parliament. “That is no more and no less than what the law requires.”Freya Danby of Leigh Day, who represented Hippolyte, said: “Throughout this process, she has shown remarkable courage and resilience, continuing her fight for indefinite leave to remain despite numerous setbacks.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

His decisions, delays and refusal to listen to warnings cost tens of thousands of lives that could and should have been saved,” Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice UK said in a statement.“He must be held accountable. We are not asking for an apology. We are asking for consequences.Boris Johnsonshould have no role in public life and no further entitlement to public funds.”The second report from the public inquiry into the pandemic published on Thursdayfound Johnson’s government had acted “too little, too late”, and that locking the country down a week earlier in March 2020 could have saved about 23,000 lives.The inquiry, led by the retired judge and crossbench peer Heather Hallett, found he had “repeatedly changed his mind on whether to introduce tougher restrictions and failed to make timely decisions”.It also said he had presided over a “toxic and chaotic culture” in Downing Street that hampered decision-making, and that he had “intentionally fostered conflict and a chaotic working environment”.Criticism was also levelled at the leaders of the devolved nations, but Johnson was the most severely rebuked for his actions.As a former prime minister, Johnson is allowed to claim as much as £115,000 a year from the public duty costs allowance. He claimed the full amount in 2024-25.The statement by Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice UK said: “It is intolerable that bereaved families are expected to subsidise the lifestyle of the man whose decisions led to the deaths of our loved ones. That must end.”The campaign group, which has about 7,000 members from across the UK, also said it would pursue “all available legal options to seek personal accountability for Johnson’s decisions during the pandemic”.“Now that the inquiry has spoken, there must be accountability,” it said. “While our focus has always been on learning lessons to save lives in the future, individual accountability must be part of delivering justice.“Justice for those we lost means real consequences for those who failed them, and we will not stop until that justice is delivered.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He has already served 17 years but his sentence in 2018 was extended at the request of the bank for a further 20 years,according to information given to a UN working party on arbitrary detention, meaning he will not be released until 2038, when he will be 84 years old.He was accused of failing to keep up payments to the bank over a loan to fund a business deal, a charge he denies, and was required by a Dubai court to pay $432m.DIB brought proceedings to recover the loan using a law that extends prison sentences for convicts who fail to return proceeds of fraud.Cornelius’s wife, Heather, is in effect homeless and he has no means of raising the sums required to secure his release.The bank has seized all of his assets, including a property development called the Plantation land, now renamed the Acres, that would be worth more than $3bn on the basis of advertised villa prices. That valuation after the land has been developed is more than double the amount of his outstanding restructured loan from the bank.Cornelius was arrested apparently at DIB’s request while travelling through Dubai in May 2008 on his way back from Karachi, Pakistan, to his home in Bahrain. At the time he and his partners were $10m ahead of the agreed repayment schedule, his brother-in-law Chris Pagett claims.The allegations come as theUnited Arab Emirateshas undertaken to consider a letter sent by 146 British parliamentarians, urging Dubai to show clemency. Khalid Saud Al Qasimi, the UAE deputy ambassador in London, last week met Tim Roca, a Labour MP and vice-chair of the inter-parliamentary group on arbitrary detention, and said he would ensure the letter was passed to the relevant authorities in Dubai.Other parliamentarians, including the former Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith and the liberal democrat peer Tim Clement-Jones, went to the UAE embassy in London to hand over the letter last week, but it was decided only one MP should meet Emirati diplomats.The MPs are hoping that the UAE’s national day on 2 December – often a moment in which leaders issue pardons – could be an occasion for the country to end Cornelius’s ordeal. A similar appeal last year brought no response from the UAE, as have other Foreign Office-backed family appeals.In 2022, the UN working group on arbitrary detention decided Cornelius was being arbitrarily detained, noting information that the extension of his initial 10-year sentence by a further 20 years in 2018 had been decided by a judge at a closed-doors, one-day hearing that bore little resemblance to an ordinary trial. The UAE did not respond to a UN request to submit evidence.The letter by the parliamentarians, couched in the most respectful terms, points out that Cornelius will have spent 30 years in jail by 2038.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

There is no suggestion that he has used his status to influence the court. The bank claims to be the first to have incorporated Islamic principles into its practices. It states: “As champions of morality, equality and transparency, our establishment reflects the modernity, diversity and growth of the city whose name we share.”The bank, which says it has 5 million customers, made a pre-tax profit of £2.01bn in the first 10 months of this year, with assets reaching £82bn. It has said the sentences are the responsibility of an independent judicial system.Cornelius was originally detained and placed in solitary confinement for six weeks, and according to information supplied to the UN working party, DIB commenced seizure of his personal assets and businesses, eventually including his London home. In 2010, he was put on trial for fraud. The case was initially dismissed for lack of evidence, but he was not released. After a retrial, in 2011 Cornelius and three other expatriates were charged with theft from a public body, in effect redefining his outstanding loan to the bank as theft from the state. He was sentenced to 10 years in prison. He was ordered to repay the outstanding balance and handed a $500m fine.Roca said: “There are two aspects to this. There clearly is a dispute about fraud and money that is denied. But he is a 71-year-old man in prison, bankrupt, and the prospect of him paying back what is owed is more than unlikely. This is a respectful cross-party request from the UK parliament for the Emir to exercise his prerogative and grant a pardon. There is an incredibly important relationship between the UAE and the UK.”Pagett said: “The clemency appeal signed by 146 British parliamentarians may at least prompt the ruler of Dubai to begin to reassess whether whatever he believes he gains by persisting in this display of implacable cruelty is worth the long-term reputational damage which he will incur.“As to Sharia banking law, it could not be clearer in setting out procedures for foreclosure. A bank should take whatever has been put up as security for the loan, establish its real value by selling it within a stipulated time frame, and net that off to establish whatever remains to be repaid by the debtor. None of that appears to have happened in Ryan’s case”.Explore more on these topicsDubaiUnited Arab EmiratesForeign, Commonwealth and Development OfficenewsShareReuse this content"

I spoke to Andy as soon as I heard about that attack when I was in Denmark. It was one of the first calls I made to get an assessment on the ground. I spoke to him the next day then I went up and met him and went through the briefings.“He’s doing a really good job as the mayor of Manchester.”Starmer urged his colleagues not to brief against him or others in the party after his own allies fuelled the leadership speculationby telling reportersthey believed the health secretary, Wes Streeting, to be planning a coup attempt.“We need to focus on what matters to the country, and what matters to the country above all else is the cost of living and that’s where my focus is,” he said. “Every minute we’re not focused on that is a minute that is wasted in the government.”The prime minister was speakingon his way to the G20 summit in South Africa, where he will announce a number of trade deals and attempt to rally international support for Ukraine.But much of his government’s attention is on domestic matters, with his chancellor finalising apotentially contentious budgetand possible leadership candidates jostling for position.Burnham restarted talk over his leadership ambitions this week as he declined to rule out challenging Starmer in the future.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

If Burnham does seek a seat in parliament, however, it is expected to be in the north-west.Meanwhile, Starmer has also insisted that journalists should be treated with respect after the US president, Donald Trump,told a female reporter: “Quiet, piggy”.The prime minister said he had been told about the comments and did not want to comment directly on them.He added, however: “My approach is that I will always be respectful to journalists whatever questions they’re putting to me … It’s really important to keep that principle of respect for journalists who are doing actually a really important job, certainly in the UK, in our democracy.”Explore more on these topicsPoliticsLabour party leadershipAndy BurnhamKeir StarmerManchesterGreater ManchesterLabournewsShareReuse this content"

Some of them ran back to their houses and the only information we are getting is that the attackers are still moving with the remaining children into the bush.”Niger, the biggest of the country’s 36 states, runs west from the capital, Abuja, to neighbouring Benin. The incident in the early hours of Friday is the third documented mass school abduction in the state in the last decade.In the last attack in Niger state, in May 2021, 135 pupils were abducted from an Islamic seminary, six of whom died while being held.On Monday, gunmen stormed a girls’ boarding school in neighbouring Kebbi state, abducting 25 schoolgirls and killing the vice-principal. According tolocal reports, security forces had relayed information about the plot and spent the night guarding the school but left the scene early.“The heavily armed security personnel spent time taking photographs with the students, only to abandon them 30 minutes before the attack,” the state governor said. Afterward, Nigeria’s president, Bola Tinubu,orderedthe junior defence minister Bello Matawalle to relocate to the state to help with rescue efforts.No group has claimed responsibility for the attacks, but analysts and locals say gangs often target schools, travellers and remote villagers in kidnappings for ransom. Authorities say the gunmen are mostly former herders who have taken up arms against farming communities after clashes over strained resources.Africa’s most populous country is beset by multiple overlapping insecurity crises across its central and northern states, of which kidnapping for ransom is just one facet.On Monday, the extremist group Islamic West Africa Province (Iswap)claimed responsibilityfor the death of a Nigerian general in north-eastern Borno state. Iswap released footage of his death as well as WhatsApp chats about a failed rescue attempt.Earlier this week, gunmen abducted 38 worshippers from a church in Kwara state, Niger state’s southern neighbour, after a brutal attack that left at least two dead, according to church officials. The attack was seen by millions of people due to a live stream of the service that was taking place.The kidnappers have since demanded a ransom of 100m naira (£52,662) a person, a possible indication that the kidnapping was financially motivated rather than ideological.Why is Donald Trump threatening military intervention in Nigeria?Read moreRegardless of motive, the scale and frequency of the attacks and kidnappings has heightened pressure on the government as it endeavours to avoid an escalating diplomatic row with theTrump administration, which has classified Nigeria as a country of particular concern (CPC), a designation given to countries where the government is deemed to have engaged in or tolerated severe violations of religious freedoms.US lawmakers including Ted Cruz have helped spread claims of a “Christian genocide” being under way in Nigeria. Trump has since said that US forces could go “guns-a-blazing” into Nigeria if the country fails to protect its Christian population. There has been a flurry of activity on Capitol Hill and in the Vatican as the situation has unfolded.Jonathan Pratt, a senior official with the US Bureau of African Affairs, told Congress on Thursday: “Terrorists, separatists, bandits and criminal militias in Nigeria are all over the country, with ongoing attacks often deliberately targeting Christian communities.”Nigeria’s government has rejected claims of an anti-Christian genocide and says the victims of the attacks are from all faiths.On Wednesday, Tinubu announced he was cancelling planned trips to South Africa and Angola this weekend for the G20 and AU-EU summits respectively.Explore more on these topicsNigeriaAfricaTrump administrationUS foreign policynewsShareReuse this content"

The noise is alas constant. But, just like the desert, inner life is fortified in prison.”At his release request hearing, Sarkozy had appeared by video link from a room in prison, describing his time inside as gruelling. He had told the court: “I want to pay tribute to all the prison staff, who are exceptionally humane, and who have made this nightmare bearable – because it is a nightmare.“I never imagined that at 70 years of age, I’d be in prison. It’s an ordeal that has been imposed on me. I confess it’s hard, it’s very hard. It leaves a mark on any prisoner because it’s gruelling.”Sarkozy, who served as France’s president between 2007 and 2012, was the first former head of an EU country and the first postwar leader ofFranceto serve time in prison.Before entering jail he had said he would use his time to write a book.It is not certain whether he had time to read and critique the three books he took into prison with him: a two-volume biography of Jesus and Alexandre Dumas’s novel The Count of Monte Cristo, in which an innocent man is sentenced to jail but escapes to take revenge.Sarkozy was held in solitary confinement for his own security in a cell of about nine sq metres (100 sq ft) with his own shower and toilet at La Santé prison in Paris. Two bodyguards occupied a neighbouring cell. The French news weekly Le Point reported that he had eaten only yoghurts in prison because he feared any food might have been spat on. He had facilities to cook for himself but refused this, the magazine reported, citing unnamed sources. It is uncertain whether Sarkozy will write about what he ate in prison.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

According to the transportation department, the dummy will be incorporated into federal vehicle crash testing once a final rule is published.Although men make up the majority of annual car-crash victims, women are more likely to die in collisions of comparable severity. Women are also 73% more likely than men to sustain serious injuries in a crash,according tostudies. In addition, they face a higher risk of specific trauma, including pelvis and liver injuries.Despite the risks women face, the dummy used in the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s five-star crash tests is still a model designed in 1978: the Hybrid III, based on a 5ft 9in, 171lb man.Compared with the Hybrid III, the THOR-05F, which is described as more “durable, accurate and lifelike”, is equipped with over 150 sensors and can gather three times as many injury measurements as current dummies. It also represents a significant shift from the long-used Hybrid III, which has been the standard in crash testing for years.While the Hybrid III dummyassesses riskof skull fracture only, the Thor-05F can assess risk of skull fracture, brain injury and facial fractures. Additionally, with the Hybrid III only being able to bend in one direction – forward and backward, the Thor-05F can bend forward and backward, side-to-side and twist.Other differences include the spine area; while the Hybrid III has a rigid spine, the Thor-05F has a more life-like flexibility, allowing the dummy to sit slouched or erect and can measure forces in the lower spine. Additionally, unlike the Hybrid III which has no abdominal or pelvis sensors, the THOR-05F is able to measure pressure to assess risk to internal organs, as well as pelvis and hip forces from seatbelt and vehicle contact. Moreover, while the Hybrid III has no arm sensors, the new dummy is able to measure forces in upper and lower arms.“Its shape and response in a crash are based on female bodies, which will ultimately enable better assessment of brain, thorax, abdominal, pelvic and lower leg injury risk for small female occupants,” the transportation department said.Hailing the new dummy, Duffy said: “After years of delays, our team has worked hard over the last eight months to finalize the details for this new, state of the art female crash test dummy. Under the leadership of President Trump, this department will continue to put the safety of American families – including women – first.”Similarly, the National Highway Traffic Safety administrator, Jonathan Morrison, said: “This is a long overdue step toward the full adoption of this new dummy for use in our safety ratings and Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards.”Additionally, the US senators Deb Fischer of Nebraska and Tammy Duckworth of Illinois – both co-sponsors of theShe Drives Act, which seeks to improve vehicle safety testing – welcomed the announcement.“It’s far past time to make these testing standards permanent, which will help save thousands of lives and make America’s roads safer for all drivers,” Fischersaid, with Duckworthadding:“Any progress here is good because there’s simply no good reason why women are more likely to be injured or die in car crashes.”Thursday’s unveiling follows other countries that have adopted improved, female-specific crash test dummies over the years includingAustraliaandSweden.Explore more on these topicsRoad safetyTransport policyUS politicsEngineeringnewsShareReuse this content"

This creates the basis for significantly stricter prosecutions,” Alexander Dobrindt, the interior minister, said on Friday. “We are committed to clear consequences and consistent enforcement. Women should feel safe and be able to move freely everywhere.”Nearly 54,000 women and girls were the victims of sexual offences in Germany in 2024 – an increase of 2.1% on the previous year – of which nearly 36% were victims of rape and sexual assault.A parliamentary debate over a bill calling for a mandatory minimum five-year prison sentence for the use of date rape drugs in sexual assaults was postponed last month.Police last year registered a record high of almost 266,000 domestic violence victims, a 3.8% increase on the previous year. However, there were a high number of unreported cases, the head of the federal criminal police office, Holger Münch, said.“We must work to ensure that more victims find the courage to report crimes in order to improve the protection and support for victims,” he added.Although there is no uniform federal definition for femicide in Germany, nearly 1,200 women and girls were recorded as victims of homicide or attempted homicide in 2024, a slight decrease year on year.The German government this week approved a draft law allowing the use of electronic ankle monitors to track perpetrators of domestic violence. Victims can also request a separate device to warn them when the perpetrator is nearby.Dobrindt said the government had also secured funding for the national rollout of an app allowing domestic abuse victims to secretly document abuse incidents to be used later in court.In the UK,Rape Crisisoffers support on 0808 500 2222 in England and Wales, 0808 801 0302 inScotland, or 0800 0246 991 inNorthern Ireland.

Play our interactive budget gameRead moreIn the fiscal year so far, borrowing was running at £116.8bn, the ONS said – £9.9bn more than the independentOffice for Budget Responsibility(OBR) expected the government would be borrowing at this point. It will publish new forecasts alongside the budget next week.Martin Beck, the chief economist at the consultancy WPI Strategy, said: “As things stand, total borrowing in 2025-26 could overshoot the OBR’s full-year forecast by around £10bn, pushing the deficit close to 5% of GDP.“Combined with policy U-turns, market movements, and a deteriorating productivity outlook, the chancellor’s headroom against her fiscal rules has almost certainly vanished.”UK borrowing chartThe bond markets are a key audience for next Wednesday’s budget, and will be paying close attention to how much “headroom” Reeves has left herself against her fiscal rules, at the end of the forecast period in five years’ time.Nick Ridpath, a research economist at the Institute for Fiscal Studies, said the fact the deficit was running so far ahead of OBR projections made as recently as March emphasised the need for a larger financial buffer.“Forecasts for the level of borrowing this year are subject to considerable uncertainty, never mind those for borrowing in four or five years’ time,” he said.“Operating with minimal fiscal margin for error is risky, and this is one reason why the chancellor might sensibly take steps to increase her so-called ‘fiscal headroom’ at next week’s budget.”Russell Shor, senior market analyst at trading platform Tradu.com, said the size of the headroom would be a key test for government bonds, or gilts.“Gilt yields saw their biggest jump since July last Friday after reports that income-tax rises had been dropped, turning the budget into a crucial test of fiscal discipline, particularly whether Reeves can unlock roughly £20bn of headroom without unsettling sentiment,” he said.The ONS said central government spending was £3.7bn higher in October than a year ago – pointing to rising benefits payments because of higher-than-expected inflation, and pay increases for public servants.Reeves will deliver her second budget on Wednesday against a difficult political background, after the Treasury floated and thenditched plans to raise income tax.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

That money should be going to our schools, hospitals, police and armed forces. That is why we are set to deliver the largest primary deficit reduction in both the G7 and G20 over the next five years – to get borrowing costs down,” he said.The ONS said the government had to pay £8.4bn in debt interest in October – as payments on inflation-linked gilts, or government bonds, were larger than expected due to continued high inflation.Alongside tax rises, Reeves is also expected to deliver a package of cost of living measures in the budget, aimed at bringing inflation down. As a first step, she announced on Friday that prescription charges will be frozen for another year.Reeves’s first fiscal rule says she should try to bring the current budget into surplus by 2030 – so that day-to-day spending is matched by revenues. The ONS said the deficit on this measure was £12.6bn in October, £2.6bn more than forecast by the OBR.The shadow chancellor, Mel Stride, said: “If Labour had any backbone, they would control spending to avoid tax rises next week. While Labour plan to spend more and more, Conservatives would cut the deficit and cut taxes with our golden economic rule and our £47bn savings plan.”The worse-than-expected borrowing figures came as official retail sales data showed an unexpected 1.1% month-on-month decline in October, the first fall since May, with some analysts blaming consumer jitters before the budget.Explore more on these topicsGovernment borrowingBudget deficitEconomicsPublic financeEconomic growth (GDP)Office for National StatisticsOffice for Budget ResponsibilitynewsShareReuse this content"

Economists had been expecting sales growth to be flat on the previous month.Supermarkets, clothing stores and online mail order companies suffered sales declines, which some retailers said was due to consumers delaying purchases in the run-up to the annual Black Friday sales, according to the ONS.UK is worst-performing market for JD Sports as youth unemployment hits salesRead moreClothing, footwear and textile stores posted a 3.3% month-on-month drop in sales, the largest fall, after strong summer when shoppers were motivated to buy clothes during warm weather and sporting events improved consumers’ mood.Supermarkets recorded a sales decrease of 1.1% in October, the second consecutive monthly fall.Online retail sales fell 1.7% month on month, while fuel sales dropped 2.4% in October compared with September.Some analysts also attributed the surprise fall in sales in October to consumer jitters over the upcoming budget, which the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, will present next week.“The uncertainty surrounding what the chancellor’s budget next week will mean for individuals is only further dampening consumer confidence and spending intentions,” said Rajeev Shaunak, the head of consumer at the accountancy and advisory firm MHA.“The Christmas trading period will be critical, and early sales indicators are expected to confirm that consumer demand remains sluggish, creating a perfect storm for retailers.”Pre-budget nerves were also cited by the research firm S&P Global as it published its monthly flash PMI survey, showing a slowdown in the services sector.The flash PMI for November slowed to 50.5, from 52.2 in October. A reading above 50 signals expansion. S&P said the services sector was particularly week, adding “many businesses attributed this to heightened client caution ahead of the November budget”.On Friday, the research company GfK released data showing that consumer confidence has fallen on every measure of its index this month.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

However, the growing cost of the government’s energy policies has pushed the cap higher.Use smart tech, turn heat down, service boilers: how to save money on energy billsRead moreThe change in the cap – which dictates themaximum that suppliers can charge their 29 million household customersfor each unit of gas and electricity – amounts to an increase of 28p a month for an average household. Ofgem said that when adjusting for inflation the cap is 2%, or £37, lower than the same period in 2025.However, bills for this winter are expected to remain about 50% higher than they were before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine triggered a jump in energy market prices that spurred the cost of living crisis.Energy price cap chartJust this week experts at the consultancy Cornwall Insight had been forecasting thatthe cap would fall by 1%because of lower wholesale energy prices, before rising again in April because of rising levies on bills.Ofgem said wholesale prices were currently stable and had fallen by 4% over the past three months, but conditions remained “volatile”.The cap increase will hit hardest for households who rely more on electricity than gas for their cooking and heating, in a blow to government ambitions to encourage households to replace their boilers and gas hobs with electric alternatives to cut emissions.Martin Lewis, the founder of MoneySavingExpert.com, warned that households with high electricity use, and low or no gas use, will see their bills rise by 3% to 4% because the cap on electricity costs has climbed higher than the cap on gas.The cap on electricity unit rates will climb by 5.1% to 27.69p a kilowatt hour to reflect the rise in government levies used to pay for the build out of electricity networks and to support the government’swarm home discount scheme. Meanwhile, the cap on gas will fall by 5.7% to 5.93p a kwH due to the falling wholesale cost of gas.“The prediction is a 4-5% rise in April because of policy costs, and they are going to keep going up until the mid-2030s,” Lewis told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. “We need a national debate about this because these policy costs are going to make an ever bigger proportion of our bills.”He called for a social tariff for vulnerable customers who cannot shop around for deals to be introduced, because the energy price cap that is meant to protect them is too expensive and not fit for purpose.Tim Jarvis, the director general for markets at Ofgem, said: “While energy prices have fallen in real terms over the past two years, we know people may not be feeling it in their pockets.“The price cap helps protect households from overpaying for energy. But it’s only a safety net and there are practical ways that customers can pay less for their energy.”Official figures show that UK energy debt has climbed from £2bn three years ago to £4.4bn this year. Figures from Citizens Advice show that nearly 7 million people in Great Britain are living in households in debt to their supplier – about 10% of the population.The fuel poverty charity National Energy Action called on the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, to use next week’s budget to help tackle the “crippling levels of household energy debt” by taking the cost of some environmental levies off the energy bills and recover the costs through general taxation.Reeves is understood to be looking at plans to tackle rising household costsby eliminating the 5% VAT chargeon electricity bills.The minister for energy consumers, Martin McCluskey, said: “We know that energy bills remain too high. We are taking the long-term action needed to bring down bills for good with the government’s clean power mission.”Explore more on these topicsEnergy billsOfgemConsumer affairsHousehold billsUK cost of living crisisnewsShareReuse this content"

To others, it would be an anti-growth tax that will backfire, costing thousands of jobs and fuelling the illicit market.The devil is in the detail.How is gambling taxed?It’s complicated but, in essence, it works like this. When customers win, they aren’t taxed at all. For companies, there are three main rates of duty:Remote gaming duty (RGD), applied to online games of chance, is levied at 21% of profits applied to what they win from punters.Machine games duty (MGD) applies to physical slot machines, mostly at 20%.General betting duty (GBD) is taxed on bookmakers’ winnings from sports such as football and horse racing, mostly at 15% in betting shops and online.Together, these duties raised about £2.5bn last year, paid out of total industry revenues of about £11.5bn.What is being proposed?The Treasury has consulted on harmonising the varying tax rates but almost nobody wants this to happen or thinks it will.Two influential thinktanks, the IPPR and SMF, recommend increasing all of the rates significantly, to raise £3.2bn and £2bn respectively. Both say that RGD, the largest of the duties because it is charged on the fast-growing online sector, should be more than doubled to 50%. The former prime minister Gordon Brown has swung hispolitical heftbehind the higher figure, which he and the IPPR say could pay for an end to the two-child cap on state benefits.What do gambling companies say?They claim increases on this scale would cause huge job losses, drive punters to unregulated illicit operators that put customers at greater risk and would ultimately be counter-productive, resulting in lower tax receipts.A report by the accounting firm EY, commissioned by the industry’s trade body, the Betting and Gaming Council (BGC), suggests the IPPR’s proposal could result in the loss of 40,000 jobs and cost the UK economy £3bn a year. The IPPR has described this analysis as “deeply flawed”.The boss of Betfred, the billionaire Tory donor Fred Done, hasclaimed would have to close all of his 1,287 bookmakersif taxes go up, at a loss of 7,500 jobs alone.Are they “scaremongering”?That is the accusation levelled at gambling companies in a report by MPs on the Treasury select committee, after a testy evidence session with the chief executive of the BGC, Grainne Hurst. She sparked gawps of incredulity among MPs when she claimed that gambling did not cause any “social ills”. The committee did not find this credible and applied the same scepticism to the industry’s doomsaying about tax rises.There appears to be a playbook. Stewart Kenny, the retired co-founder of Paddy Power who now campaigns for tougher gambling regulation, told the committee that he too used to raise the spectre of the illicit market when he was an industry advocate trying to lobby against higher taxes.It is also worth looking back at what the industry claimed when the government unveiled plans to cut the £100-a-spin stake on fixed odds betting terminals (FOBTs) in 2018. Back then, a KPMG report for the industry claimed more than 4,000 bookmakers would close. In the end, about half that number did and much of that was down to the pandemic and the long-term shift to online gambling, encouraged by gambling companies themselves.The Betfred billionaire’s apocalyptic predictions should also be taken with a pinch of salt. Back in 2018, he said FOBT curbs would force 500 of his 1,644 shops to shut. Two years later the Done family paid themselves a £10m dividend and the chain still has 1,287 shops.What about lobbying?It has been intense. During a summer charm offensive by the BGC the industry hosted senior Labour staffers at a darts-themed evening, while BGC chair, Michael Dugher, boasted of his many meetings with senior MPs, including one of his oldest and closest friends in politics, who happens to be Rachel Reeves. A source close to the chancellor said she had no formal meeting with the BGC and would not ever have discussed the tax changes with him.The media played its part too. The Sun, for instance, ran a front-page campaign headlined “Save Our Bets” that urged Reeves to “shelve crackdown on fun”. The Sun Bingo website’s revenues from its shared betting partnership with the gambling software company Playtech increased 7% to €78.9m (£69.4m) last year. SunBets is to be relaunched next year.Is there some truth in industry warnings?Yes. First, the illicit market isn’t a total paper tiger. It is growing and there is some reason to believe that raising taxes too steeply risks contributing to that.Alun Bowden, a leading industry analyst at Eilers & Krejcik Gaming, explains that one of the biggest pulls for customers is being offered “bonuses”, such as free bets given on opening an account.“It’s the main way of attracting and retaining players. It’s buy one get one free at Tesco, or the loyalty card at Pret,” he says.These “free” bets aren’t customers’ real cash, they are notional “house” money. However, when punters lose these bets, the sums still count towards the duties levied on operators.“[If taxes rise] the sensible thing is to slash that bonus because you’re giving more of your own money to the government. The black market would not do that. If anything they’d increase it.”This, says Bowden, means that the threat of an exodus to the parallel market cannot be ignored. “It’ll happen slowly and then all at once,” he says, addding that it is also true that there is a level of tax that would result in a much smaller online gambling industry, or even wipe out profitability. For RGD, Bowden says, this falls somewhere between 35% and 40%.There are undoubtedly many people who campaign for gambling reform who would be happy to see a smaller UK industry.What about horse racing?Horse racing relies heavily on income from bookmakers, through media rights deals, fees for data, and the horse racing levy, worth about £100m a year (effectively an extra 10% tax on racing bet income). Both the SMF and IPPR have recommended a carve-out for horse racing that would mean lower duties and mitigation measures. The SMF recommended increasing the levy to mitigate any negative consequences.Elements of the horse racing industry, many of whom have no affection for online casino games, have broken ranks with the bookies, saying they would be happy with higher duties on that part of the industry, as long as they are left alone. Thebookmakers argue you cannot separate the two like that. If their income is curbed, they will have less to contribute to racing through media rights deals, so racing will suffer.What will happen?Chatter in the industry and in Westminster suggests the Treasury will probably end up opting for a middle ground, raising between £1bn and £2bn without triggering significant job cuts.Most of the rise will probably apply to RGD, given the relative unpopularity of online casino and slot machines games with the general public. To raise an extra £1bn without increasing GBD), RGD and MGD would have to go up by more than 10 percentage points each.Explore more on these topicsGamblingTax and spendingBudget 2025BudgetexplainersShareReuse this content"

More than anyone else, Mackerras was prime mover of the ENO’s pioneering reimaginings of Handel’s operas. This Partenope,first seen in 2008, is a brave reassertion of that treasured inheritance. Sadly, though, the ENO itself is now a shadow of what it became in Mackerras’s day; its chief execJenny Mollica quitearlier this week.Still, it remains cheering to see ENO can still turn in a high-class Handel show. In Partenope the characters may be classical staples but the superficially political plot is really more of a domestic comedy. Partenope herself, supposed founder of modern Naples, is being wooed by three princely suitors, one of whom, Arsace, is pursued by his former lover Rosmira, thinly disguised as a man. The maelstrom of passions and longings this gang can generate between them, though, are believable enough, sometimes searingly so.The production byChristopher Aldentakes this mix of sex and warfare and punts it into the brittle world of 1920s Parisian surrealism. Partenope is now a society hostess. Her foe Emilio is a Man Ray-type photographer. The suitors are emotionally rudderless hangers-on. Alden has returned to supervise this revival too, and his presence ensures a taut, allusive and sometimes wacky staging. It can be confusing at times, but that does not really matter. Alden’s stage creativity means you don’t have to keep close track of who is who, or why they do what they do, to respond to – and to care about – Partenope’s edgy and erotic modernity.View image in fullscreenAn ideal fit … William Thomas as Ormonte and Nardus Williams as Partenope.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianNardus Williams is extremely stylish in the updated title role. She has a lot of singing to do, and though she took time to settle into her best voice, the broad lines of her act two aria, where she declares her longing for Arsace, were an ideal fit. As Arsace, the countertenor Hugh Cutting reached the evening’s peak in his emotionally jangled act-three aria of renunciation, with the theorbo and strings captivating in their accompaniment. Katie Bray was infinitely resourceful as the mixed up Rosmira. Jake Ingbar’s Armindo was ingenious, vocally and gymnastically. Ru Charlesworth was unflagging and witty as Emilio, while William Thomas seized his moments – both visually and vocally – as Ormonte.Christian Curnyn, who conducted Partenope in 2008 and againwhen it was last revivedin 2017, was back in the pit this time, too. Sadly he was taken ill during the first interval, but his assistant conductor William Cole took over for the final two acts with idiomatic assurance.At theLondon Coliseumuntil 6 DecemberExplore more on these topicsOperaClassical musicreviewsShareReuse this content"

One restless night, an idea comes to you. You work it up in your studio and send it off to the foundry, to be cast in bronze. Finally, you’re ready to show it to the world, but the first person through the gallery doors barely glances at it before taking a selfie with it. What do you do? Bear in mind that you are Tony Cragg, Royal Academician, and you are on record bemoaning the preference of many art-lovers for listening to audio guides as they tour exhibitions.The perhaps unlikely answer is that you welcome the selfie-taker with outstretched arms, or at least give a convincing impression of doing so. “No, I don’t have problem with that,” says Cragg, albeit faintly, as if he’s thinking about the people who might be crossing the threshold of his latest show, which just opened in London. “People are bound to respond in different ways.”My father thought sculpture was a very dull and unnecessary activityLiverpool-born Cragg, in a zip-up sweater and dark trousers, is a lean 76-year-old but could pass for 20 years younger. He has lived for many years in Wuppertal, Germany, exhibiting and teaching across the continent and collecting many honours to add to his 1988 Turner gong. He has had his own decided views and gone his own way since he told his father he wanted to be an artist as a teenager. “He said, ‘What a waste of time and education!’ My father was bitterly disappointed. He was an electrical engineer and worked on aircraft and thought sculpture was a very dull and unnecessary activity.”Cragg’s problem with audio guides is that they get in the way of a spectator’s relationship with an artwork. “If you have a picture on a wall,” he says, “it doesn’t matter what the artist’s intention was. A hundred people stand in front of it and they will tell you a hundred different things about it. The person comes with their education, background and abilities – and responds to what’s in front of them. People interjecting all the time disturbs that direct dialogue with the artwork.”View image in fullscreenCragg’s work at Lisson Gallery.Photograph: George Darrell/© Tony Cragg, Courtesy Lisson GalleryTechnological distractions aside, Cragg is pleased to be back in London. “I’ve lived abroad for the main part of my life, but I still feel very British. When I come back to Britain, immediately I’m more relaxed. I love British humour. I love the weather. I love the food. I feel like I’m back home, anyway.” He still supports Liverpool FC and rues their recent form. “Someone once told me, as an artist you’re only as good as your last show, and in football you’re only as good as your last game.”Cragg’s recent works include tall, free-standing forms that might gesture towards buckled or twisted skeletons. We are speaking just before his show opens and, as I watch them being wrestled into place, I think about artists on the road – musicians, say – and how much easier it is for the percussionist playing the triangle than the cellist. Of course, Cragg now has his own roadies. “I have a fantastic team,” he says. “They do everything. I arrived yesterday, moved things around for an hour, then left.” You don’t take your art on the plane with you then? “I used to,” he laughs.When I was growing up, the French were ‘Frogs’ and the Germans were ‘Krauts’Cragg’s early work included pieces that explicitly addressed issues in the land of his birth, including Riot, a frieze produced in the aftermath of the miners’ strike in 1984 and clashes between police and youths in Brixton, London. “I left Britain in 1977 at the beginning of the Thatcher period, and the destruction of the arts schools here, and a lot of other developments. It was a very extreme form of capitalism that paid no regard to the needs of the wider population.”He has also used the motifs of the crown jewels and the union flag. What did he make of seeing the flag on lamp-posts during protests in the UK this summer? “Well, it’s very difficult to live abroad and then be critical about how people live in another situation. But the most bitter disappointment I had initially was Brexit. This idea of isolationism, stepping back – I think it’s bad for the general population. It’s sad. And then you feel tendencies which are very nationalistic.“When I was growing up, the French were ‘Frogs’ and the Germans were ‘Krauts’. My parents were very unhappy that I went to Germany because of the war. But thanks to the Royal College, I went to France to work for a year and I realised, ‘Hey, the food’s not bad here!’ I noticed the furniture and the way the French treated their families: wow! But everybody has a history. My children, who are German, have this terrible burden of their history on their shoulders, from their grandparents’ generation.”Although he didn’t see eye to eye with his father about sculpture, Cragg considers it a waste of time to make busts of the famous, or the likeness of a horse. “For me, representing exactly what’s in front of you is a senseless activity, a vain attempt by humans to parody or copy nature.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toArt WeeklyFree weekly newsletterYour weekly art world round-up, sketching out all the biggest stories, scandals and exhibitionsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But, he feels, the time for figurative sculptors to lay down their chisels is long overdue. Artists such as Auguste Rodin incorporated the ideas of Sigmund Freud into their work, says Cragg, and Marcel Duchamp, who took a urinal and called it art, introduced the readymade. “When I was student, we realised that readymades were kind of running out of steam, but then people like Damien Hirst took it to another dimension with a shark in a tank.”Cragg’s first job was in a laboratory and he’s all for children studying Stem subjects, but says that without art lessons they’ll struggle to visualise what they’re learning. “Art is one of the best ways for people to have a better existence. It makes life more livable. To ignore that, in a way that has happened in Britain, is almost criminal.”He still loves what he does, saying: “I hate holidays. Twenty-five years ago, everybody needed a holiday. I spend a lot of time in Scandinavia so we found somewhere we can spend the summer in a very beautiful place where there’s the ocean and nature – and a studio! That’s perfect for me, it’s my dream.”He shows me a list of new ideas on his phone and reads some out. “First and Second, Recall, For a While, Long-stop, On and off, Way to Go, Path, Backtrack … I’m not telling you these are future sculptures or anything. They are just things that tick through in the time I wake up.”Was that a month’s worth of ideas? “I hate to say it, but that was last night.”Cragg is astonished by the popularity of contemporary art, unimaginable when he was starting out. “Now, everywhere you go has its own gallery. I live within an hour of 40 galleries showing contemporary art. But in Britain, there used to be just London. In France, only Paris.

Of course, Brandy and Monica aren’t actually fighting, they just did such a good job of pretending to hate each other on their 1998 duet The Boy Is Mine that the world has been convinced of it ever since. TheR&Blegends have taken pains to point out that their relationship is harmonious in multiple interviews leading up to this 32-date co-headline tour, even making fun of the drama in a recent Dunkinadvertthat featured them fighting over a frappe.Stevie Nicks review – rock legend dazzles Brooklyn with anecdotes and classic hitsRead moreHappily,Brandyand Monica’s sisterhood also means they’re playing their biggest venues in decades. After emerging on stage from a vintage elevator wearing sunglasses and scowling expressions, the duo launches into a kind of sing-and-dance-off, trading places and performing a trio of classics apiece as the other watches with disdain. It’s a knowing nod to their purported rivalry that begins to take on the feeling of a variety segment, which isn’t helped by the trimming of songs like What About Us? and Like This and Like That to 90 seconds apiece. Even so, their camaraderie shines through as Brandy quickly breaks character to sway and sing along to Monica’s Don’t Take It Personal (Just One Of Dem Days), a showcase for her slightly raspy, soulful vocals during which she winds her hips and aims gun fingers at the audience.View image in fullscreenBrandy and Monica.Photograph: The Boy is Mine TourBrandy and Monica’s respective music shines brightest tonight in their solo sets. Brandy’s mid-tempo Full Moon is already impossible to sing by 99% of people, but she confirms her honorific as the “vocal Bible” by further complicating it tonight, adding in extra octave-scaling runs and ad-libs. She’s captivating in tightly choreographed performances of Afrodisiac and Who Is She 2 U, and a certified kook to boot, gently needling her co-headliner like a sassy sibling. After Monica delivers a heartfelt speech about how her partner has taught her that love can cross oceans, Brandy’s eyebrows shoot upwards and she quickly informs the audience: “She still can’t swim!”It doesn’t seem that any live instruments were involved in tonight’s show, save for the organ that accompanies Brandy’s gorgeous rendition of the Never Say Never deep cut Put That on Everything. That doesn’t deter Monica, who adds a dash of Las Vegas camp to Street Symphony with shirtless male dancers and prop violins. The First Night is extended into a Diana Ross mashup that plays off the song’s Love Hangover sample, performed with hip-hop moves and a shiny cane. Razzle-dazzle isn’t always needed to pack a punch, though. Her pristine vocals fill the arena during a stripped-down, belting rendition of Angel of Mine, a tender love song with attitude and bite.Not Mariah again! New music playlists for the Christmas party seasonRead moreOther moments are more jarring. While there are minimal stage changes throughout the show, elaborate and strange video interludes punctuate the show’s six acts: one features Brandy and Monica as marionettes that get tied up together in a bundle of puppet strings, while others recap their chart achievements and memorable videos as if they’re an X Factor guest about to perform. As well as three opening acts (Kelly Rowland, Muni Long, and recent American Idolwinner Jamal Roberts), tonight’s show also features a slightly perplexing array of special guests includingCiara, who performs a brilliantly athletic four-song medley, as well as Fat Joe, Tyrese and NYC cult rapper Max B. “If you got time, we got time,” beams Monica around three-quarters through the show, as Fabolous strides on to the stage to perform Into You. Ma’am, it is 11.30pm on a school night.Soon, Brandy and Monica reunite on stage. In tribute to Whitney Houston, who mentored both artists, the pair duet on a fun, loose cover of I Wanna Dance with Somebody (Who Loves Me), before closing the show out with – what else? – The Boy Is Mine. On a stage filled with dry ice, the pair go all in on scenery-chewing, as Brandy tosses her hair and stamps her feet while Monica purses her lips and rolls her eyes. It’s been a strange couple of hours to get here, but the reward is a sing-off for the ages.Explore more on these topicsR&BNew YorkreviewsShareReuse this content"

He has never read a self-help book, had no intention of becoming an actor and briefly went deaf after putting toilet paper in his ears to get to sleep. He has shutters, not curtains, in his bedroom, but has no idea what time he wakes up. If you invite him to a dinner party he will bring you exfoliating products, except don’t invite him, because he won’t come. He is good at making custard, but doesn’t cook because he lives alone “and it would be too sad”.The Surrey-born actor is as renowned for his suits as he is his singular ability to inhabit a role while remaining recognisably himself throughout. But almost 50 years into his career, Nighy is finally playing himself. A new podcast called Ill-advised casts the 75-year-old as an agony uncle, doling out advice and his innermost secrets to listeners from Italy to Mongolia to Scotland. The actor describes it as a “refuge for the clumsy and awkward”. But it’s gently becoming the cult podcast of the year. In the most recent episode, Nighy has even threatened to make merch.‘I think about death 35 times a day’: Bill Nighy on sex, social media – and still being able to manage the stairsRead moreLaunched last month, the questions Nighy tackles range wildly, from how to avoid going to parties to “Why doesn’t my horse like me?” His advice is always conversational, generous and uncertain, with a sprinkling of his trademark self-deprecation. Each episode begins with various reasons why you shouldn’t listen to a word he says.Callers come for the advice – his sybaritic cure for insomnia involving a marmite sandwich, two types of cake and a good book is one for the ages – but most stay for the digressive life stories. How he left home on the strength of a Bob Dylan album, and decades later ended up in possession of Dylan’s harmonica (the only other person to own one is Carla Bruni, who is apparently “still fighting” with Nicolas Sarkozy over it). Or how his commitment to smuggling Marmite on set saw him stopped twice at Heathrow customs. Or the origins of his trademark fidget – a mixture of nerves and obscuring the fact that he can’t act – which once led to him being marked out by the actor Donald Sinden for being the first person ever to act with their legs. His advice is compelling and digressive, but always with an edge. And one suspects his love of Marmite may have contributed to his singledom.Celebrity podcasts are not new. Quite the reverse. Even Tom Hanks, the most private celebrity in Hollywood, has appeared on three separate podcasts this year. Whether guesting or hosting, they have become another requirement of the celebrity junket, one that gives the celeb more control because they can manage the context.It’s a way of controlling the narrative, says Ben Kerr, chief executive of Cold Glass Productions, which makes Dish, the food podcast hosted by Nicholas Grimshaw and Angela Hartnett, which has featured interviews with Natalie Portman and Florence Pugh among others. “The best celebrity and celebrity-led podcasts put you in an intimate space and make you feel like you’re part of something bigger,” he says. The rise of streaming means “we’re missing those big, gather-round-the-TV moments” with “like-minded people”.Take Stanley Tucci, who upended the internet with his negroni recipes during the pandemic, or the success of Fashion Neurosis with Bella Freud, in which the great-granddaughter of Sigmund Freud elicits intimate tales from A-listers while they lie on a couch – or, of course, Celebrity Traitors. “If you look at the most successful shows, it’s not always the famous people we like,” he says. “It’s the ones with a sense of fun, the ones that are honest, and with a personality, which in case of Bill is that of a stylish guy with a weird authority.”Bill Nighy: I stole complete works of Shakespeare to help me get into drama schoolRead moreAs to why some land and some don’t, “it’s self-selecting”, says Kerr. “But it’s also about providing the right lens to draw people in.” It helps that it’s Nighy, a man who is surprisingly anti-drugs yet enjoys “saying fuck into a microphone”. The actor Johnny Flynn, who starred with Nighy in the 2020 adaptation of Emma, describes him as not only “one of the best people I’ve ever met” but also “viscerally honest and kind”. He tells the Guardian: “He reminds anyone he works with what life is really about.”“We are living in the age of people never feeling more lonely, with more change – whether it’s lifestyle or tech – than ever,” says Kerr. “We’re looking for company, we want to spend time with our mates, and a good podcast can make you feel that.”The authenticity of the medium makes you feel as if he’s talking directly to you, even if it’s a one-way relationship, the aural equivalent of getting into a warm bath with him. As Flynn concludes: “Bill is everyone’s agony uncle within five minutes of meeting him.”Bill Nighy’s rules for livingKeep collars long. Spread collars make him “uneasy”, and low-slung trousers are “unsettling”;Glasses are for hiding behind. Avoid coloured specs. His black-framed specs are Cutler and Gross;Every man should own a navy suit …… and Levi’s 501s – “just not too tight – don’t be weird”;The maximum age to get a first tattoo should be 12;No men should wear linen, and never think of going sockless;The words “beverage”, “moist” and “sheathed” should all be banned.This article was amended on 21 November 2025. Bill Nighy said on his podcast that the maximum age to get a first tattoo should be 12, not the minimum age as an earlier version said.Explore more on these topicsBill NighyPodcastingPodcastsInternetDigital mediafeaturesShareReuse this content"

Now, 10 years on, comes a second –and it’s a scorching account of a breakupFri 21 Nov 2025 08.00 ESTShareGoon, the 2015 debut album by Canada-born LA musician Tobias Jesso Jr, was one of the revelations of the 2010s.An album of heartfelt, earnest balladsin the vein of 70s singer-songwriters such as Randy Newman and Harry Nilsson, it instantly established Jesso as a rising indie star and was one of the year’s most acclaimed records. The problem was that Jesso didn’t care much for the attention: he struggled to feel like a genuine performer, leading him to drink heavily before shows, and felt he was playing a version of himself in interviews. “I was forced to do all these things I wasn’t really confident in,” he says. “I was just like … I don’t know what I’m doing, anywhere.” So, toward the end of his breakout year, he cancelled all future shows and, in essence, put his career on ice.In the decade that followed, he kept himself behind the scenes, in the process becoming one of the world’s most successful and in-demand pop songwriters – thanks, in no small part, to his focus on simple, emotions-first songwriting. He co-wrote Adele’s hitWhen We Were Youngand a handful of tracks on Dua Lipa’s 2024 albumRadical Optimism; has collaborated with Harry Styles, Justin Bieber, FKA twigs and Haim; and in 2023 won the first ever Grammy for songwriter of the year.Now, a decade on from his first record, and with little notice, Jesso has released Shine, its equally heartfelt follow-up. Speaking over Zoom from his home in Silver Lake, Los Angeles, he seems as surprised as anyone that he’s stepping back into the spotlight. “Getting into the songwriting thing, you learn all these tricks of the trade,” he says. “I had to forget all those and go: ‘What do I want to say? How do I want to say it?’ I knew with this, if I was really going to stand behind it, I needed to make [it] the uncompromised version of myself.”View image in fullscreenHe writes the songs … Tobias Jesso Jr.Photograph: Justin ChungAt only eight tracks, totalling less than 30 minutes – all, once again, featuring only Jesso and his piano – Shine is a modest album. But its waters run deep, touching on his mother’s dementia diagnosis as well as fatherhood – Jesso shares a young son with his ex-wife, the Australian songwriter Emma Louise. He began to have an inkling that he wanted to write for himself again after his breakup earlier this year – a feeling he hadn’t experienced since he was writing Goon.“I like to share my stories in [songwriting] sessions and use things from my life to fill in the gaps, but I never really felt like I had a whole song to say,” he says. “Before this album, I was doing sessions and going through a breakup, and I had to process a lot. I found myself not wanting to share special lines or things that would come to me because they were so rooted to me. I just had this gut knowing that I needed to work these songs out myself.”Around the beginning of May, Jesso blocked six weeks out from his schedule – the longest break from his day-to-day songwriting work he’d ever taken – and set to work writing Shine. Some of the songs on the album are brand new; others are reworked from Jesso’s huge folder of unused ideas that he’s amassed over the past decade. The first song he finished was the album’s opening track, Waiting Around, a scorching postmortem of his breakup: “You were upset / Every other morning / Like a sharp knife / Had me dancing on edge,” he sings.In recent years, pop has been dominated by tabloid-baiting pop that tempts listeners into trying to work out the real-life narrative behind the songs: think Olivia Rodrigo’s Drivers License, about a real-life love triangle, or Lily Allen’s recently released, much discussedWest End Girl, a tell-all about her divorce from the actor David Harbour. Jesso says that he “didn’t want to fall on any tricks” when it came to writing about his personal life. “I didn’t want to use names or any little dates or stuff: I wanted to make it for me, a song that I felt like would convey exactly where I am and what I’m going through,” he says. “I wasn’t trying to be disrespectful … When I finished [that song], I was like: ‘Man, I just wrote one of my songs again, holy fuck! It’s amazing that I did that.’”I want to find the artists who want to get a little bit more unique, not just chase something that’s already been doneOne song on the album – the dramatic, intense I Love You, which builds to a clattering maelstrom – had a less conventional genesis. During a reading from Wendy L’Belle-Tividad, an LA psychic whose client list includes a number of high-profile musicians, Jesso was told that there was a song missing from Shine, which was “really dramatic”. The next time he was sitting at the piano, he wrote I Love You, undeniably the loudest and most dramatic song he’s ever written, building to an intense, alarming climax that sounds like a door slamming over and over. “That’s my favourite song I’ve written to date,” he says. “But here’s the thing: I’m like, was it inception or was it a psychic reading?”While Shine does bear great resemblance to Goon – which definitely has something to do with Jesso’s distinctive, pleading timbre – it’s also undeniably the work of someone who has been in the pop trenches for the better part of a decade, in part because of the poppy structure of the songs and in part because of credited collaborators such as Tommy King and Julian Bunetta, fixtures of the LA pop scene. While Jesso says that, for the most part, he tried to ignore his big-budget pop instincts, he credits Justin Bieber, with whom Jesso worked on his recent albumsSwagandSwag II, as a bolstering force.“The sessions with Justin were right before I wrote this stuff, and he is the most insane, courageous artist – [he’ll] just get on a mic and start singing something, and it sounds like a song. It just happens so naturally,” he says. “[Working with him] was so raw compared with these pop sessions where they’re like: ‘What’s on the Top 40?’ – there was no trickery. It was mind-boggling that at his level, he was doing something that I was scared to do. It changed my perspective on a lot of things.”Those kinds of sessions, he says, are rare. “I’m still disenchanted with how a lot of pop music gets made – it’s a little bit of a cop-out. I’ve been party to it as well, so I can safely say I also am embarrassed about being party to it,” he says. “I feel very grateful for [being] able to work with artists that I don’t feel like would ever put themselves into that sort of deplorable writing; the artists I choose to write with would also kind of cringe at a few of those Top 40 songs.”He continues: “I’m not dogging anyone for writing pop songs in any way, you know? Write all the pop songs you want. Maybe it is about money.” Jesso does not name names, but it’s easy enough to conjure the kind of music he’s talking about: disposable, trend-chasing pop that’s heavily reliant on samples or references, or which simply rehashes older, well-trodden ideas. “I want to find the artists who don’t agree with that and maybe want to get a little bit more unique and push a little bit more, and not just stay in the zone where you’re chasing something that’s already been done.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Dean recently sold out four dates at the O2 in London, with two more on their way there; Man I Need, a 70s-ish lounge single co-written by Jesso, peaked at No 5 on the US Hot 100 chart. “Olivia is a great example of … Some people you just meet and you just go: ‘You got it – you’re a force,’” he says. “You can see when someone carries their own integrity and their own assurance of what they’re doing, and for a songwriter, that’s the most exciting thing. Somebody who’s very strong in their opinion is like a godsend to me.”Even so, Jesso says artists such as Bieber and Dean are probably outliers. “I don’t know that the pendulum seems like it’s gonna swing back to like, 70s-style songwriting or quality – putting it in for the craft – with AI and everything that’s happening now,” he says. “It’s gonna get a lot worse. People are already using AI for everything, so it’s like: cool now it’s not even gonna be human.”Although Jesso prefers to be the only songwriter in a room with an artist, there are exceptions where he doesn’t mind being one of a handful of credited songwriters, as was the case when working on Dua Lipa’s Radical Optimism. “Going in with Dua and getting to work with Dua, and getting to work with Kevin [Parker of Tame Impala], getting to work with Danny [L Harle], and all these people, it’s like a dream. Having names on the board doesn’t matter if they’re all people you really want to work with,” he says. It was a similar experience, he says, working in France with Bieber and his collaborators. “Usually when you see 10 names on a song, you’re going: ‘Probably four of those didn’t do shit. Or just changed a word.’ But those motherfuckers put themselves on the line for all of those songs – every name on there is a name that should be on there.”Working on Shine hasn’t changed the fact that Jesso still wants to keep his day job as a behind-the-scenes songwriter, though he’s due for another upheaval. He’s about to move to a farm he owns in Byron Bay, Australia, where he plans to spend half the year in order to be close to his son, who’s about to start school there. “I’ve got a few close friends close by, which is really good, but it’s going to be a big new start and a big change. I guess there’s a lot of space for not really knowing if it’s going to be filled with joy or sadness,” he says. “Over the last five years, I’ve tried to find a way to bring more life into the mix, more than just work, because I think for a long period of time in my life, it was just all work – it was an obsession, almost. This is sort of a big test: can I handle months of life without too much work?”Shine won’t require too much of the stuff he hated circa Goon – he’s doing few interviews and will probably only play one or two shows, “just to show people the songs … like, three-song sets”, he says. “I don’t know that performing will ever be me; it just doesn’t feel like something that’s ever me. I don’t think I see myself in front of an audience,” he says. “I’m getting ready and prepared for the move, but you know, if I’m like, depressed in Australia, I’m gonna have my piano – maybe I write a bunch more songs, maybe I don’t.”Or, to put it even more succinctly: “I think 10 years away for me is pretty comfortable.”Shine is out now.Explore more on these topicsPop and rockDua LipaJustin BieberinterviewsShareReuse this content"

But songs confronting the Troubles, poverty and oppression are now going global – and changing how Ireland sees itselfAnna CafollaFri 21 Nov 2025 03.00 ESTShareOn a hot Saturday afternoon at Glastonbury, while many are nursing halfway-point hangovers, the Dublin garage punk quartet Sprints whip up a jubilant mosh pit with their charged tune Descartes, Irish tricolour flags bobbing above them. As summer speeds on, at Japan’s Fuji rock festival, new songs from Galway indie act NewDad enrapture the crowd. Travy, a Nigerian-born and Tallaght-raised rapper, crafts a mixtape inflected with his Dublin lilt, the follow-up to the first Irish rap album to top the Irish charts. Efé transcends Dublin bedroom pop to get signed by US label Fader, and on Later … With Jools Holland, George Houston performs the haunting Lilith – a tribute to political protest singers everywhere – in a distinctive Donegal accent.From Melbourne to Mexico City, concertgoers continue to scream to that opening loop on strings of Fontaines DC’s Starburster, and CMAT’s viral “woke macarena” dance to her hit single Take a Sexy Picture of Me plays out in festival pits and on TikTok. You might have heard about Kneecap, too.View image in fullscreenLeading the charge … CMAT performs at Norway’s Bergenfest 2024.Photograph: Per Ole Hagen/RedfernsIreland has always had a fair few punks, ravers and big indie acts, be it the Cranberries, Ash or Bicep, but it’s never had an alternative music scene quite as robust or diverse as today’s: Lankum, Gilla Band, Pillow Queens, For Those I Love, John Francis Flynn and Chalk are some of the other acclaimed names, alongside a thriving underground rap scene. It’s now so successful that it is redefining what “Irish music” even is, as doors open to musicians once left out of the country’s cultural conversation.“It’s been an Irish renaissance,” says Karla Chubb, Sprints’ singer and guitarist. The group are now midway through a UK tour, with US shows next year; they are the first Irish band signed to US indie label Sub Pop. She cites Fontaines DC and CMAT as “a blueprint” for making it internationally. “As a Dublin band, you’d once have hoped to play Vicar Street”, a mid-sized venue. “Now we have the drive to go bigger.” Music, she says, is no longer an “unpaid internship”.View image in fullscreen‘A universal understanding’ … Gurriers.Photograph: Joshua MulhollandUniting today’s acts is a spirit of rebellion, quick wit and vulnerable lyricism, with recurring themes of solidarity and marginalisation, made by a youth still emerging from the Troubles and the legacy of the Celtic Tiger (the Irish property boom, 2008 crash and subsequent recession). Sprints lit up a banner for trans rights during their Glasto set, while Dundalk act the Mary Wallopers had their set at Portsmouth’s Victorious festival cut after they voiced their support for Palestine. Irish Artists for Palestine recently facilitated an Irish tour for the all-women Palestinian choir Daughters of Jerusalem. “This understanding of oppression and colonialism we have is generational,” saysDan Hoff of Dublin five-piece Gurriers.Sprints’ second album, released in September, is “inspired by the disparity of finally realising our dreams and doing music full-time, against the homeless crisis in Ireland, the war in Gaza, the cost of living,” says Chubb. “They’re issues all acrossEurope, so on an international stage, we’re shining a light on a shared struggle.”“The songs are written about Ireland, but I wanted to write them in a universal understanding,” says Hoff. His band Gurriers released debut album Come and See in 2024, supported Fontaines DC and landed a track on EA Sports FC 26. The band are vexed about the far right’s rise in Ireland and beyond, and their spitting protest song Approachable was written in the voice of an online rightwing edgelord; Dipping Out is about the Irish emigrating, but expands, Hoff says, “like an Adam Curtis documentary, critiquing the zeitgeist.“People feel isolated and let down by those in power … the situation isn’t just an Irish one. I try to avoid any Irish idioms in my lyrics,” Hoff adds.“The world is pretty much on fire … and against this rise in AI-generated music, people want something real and grounding. This is something Ireland does incredibly well,” says Nikki MacRae, music officer at Belfast city council. “Irish songwriters have always championed authenticity, and audiences crave this more than ever.”“Irishness has become a thing people covet,” agrees Julie Dawson of NewDad, “which is mad, because not too long ago it was something people scorned.” For years British listeners would mostly reach for mainstream acts (Westlife, U2, the Corrs, B*Witched) or trad folk. Meanwhile, radio in Ireland has long been dominated by British and US acts, or otherwise limited to domestic acts Snow Patrol and Hozier, with most Irish artists deemed niche. “About nine years ago, a local artist once had their track turned down for radio play because they’d already played an Irish track that week,” says MacRae. “What makes Irish musicians class is that in the face of such challenges they double down.”Trad metal outfit the Scratch’s Cathal McKenna recalls 2011’s Oxegen festival, held not far outside Dublin, and hosting almost exclusively international headliners. “We took our influences from them … Now, seeing Ireland’s festivals filled with Irish acts feels powerful,” McKenna says, from All Together Now to Electric Picnic. “People have their own stories, languages and cities represented by amazing artists. We’re naturally confident now in a way we just weren’t back then.”View image in fullscreen‘We’re naturally confident now in a way we just weren’t back then’ … the Scratch.Photograph: Evan DohertyAs well as the music itself, there are some clear forces behind this shift. A generation of gen Z and millennial artists are reckoning with what it meant to come of age through recession, austerity and the tail end of the Troubles. The music pulsates with the sense of promises made and withdrawn: CMAT pricks the economic bubble and its devastating aftermath on her song Euro-Country, symbolised by her dancing around her soullesshometown shopping centrein the video. But there is a defiant call-to-action too. “I know it can be better if we hound it,” she sings.InNorthern Ireland, noise-punk band Enola Gay’s track PTS.DUP addressed a sectarian attack on guitarist Joe McVeigh that left him with a fractured skull. Meanwhile, on their thrashing Stiff Little Fingers-influenced song I Think You Should Leave, queer DIY punk band Problem Patterns still find hope in building community in Belfast: “Everything always comes back to the Troubles,” the song goes, “we’ve got to release the dead hand of the past.”“I think artists from Northern Ireland are thriving right now because we’ve all grown up with generational trauma and that makes for some excellent art,” says the band’s Beth Crooks. “The song is about how we love living here, in spite of the mass emigration that we see from our peers. If the right people stick around and push for change then it’s bound to happen.”View image in fullscreen‘The music scene is at a really exciting place’ … Spider.Photograph: Camille AlexanderJames Robinson, founder of Belfast’s Craic magazine, says the renaissance is partly down to local media outlets such as the Thin Air, Yeo, Nialler9 and District documenting these scenes before the British or international press caught on, alongside conferences such as Output and AVA festival, all of them “encouraging more acts to start up and keep the momentum going”. The British media’s recent embrace of politically vocal Irish artists, he adds, suggests a “somewhat British fragility” about overlooking this scene in previous generations; a move past the shamrocks’n’Guinness fetishisation of Irish culture to instead really listen to Irish voices.Numerous people I speak to say another chief reason for such a thriving scene is Ireland’s growing cultural diversity. “Artists are shouting loud in the face of attempts to narrow the perception of what is Irish,” says MacRae, as xenophobic and racist unrest has gripped the country in recent months.Belfast-based rapper Emby brought dance music festival AVA its first ever grime set. After competing against Beyoncé and the Weeknd at the 2025 Grammys, another Belfast boy, Jordan Adetunji, continues to blend quickfire rap with trap, post-punk guitars and African dance. Spider, the Tallaght-born, now London-based producer, grew up on 90s riot grrrl acts such as Bikini Kill and Veruca Salt. Like McKenna, she had few Irish references (save, she says, for the Cranberries), and even now, “the scene can be very white and male-dominated”, she says. “But it’s at a really exciting place. We’re seeing more Irish people of colour, women and queer people come up, and the music is only getting better.”Monjola is the co-founder of Dublin’s five-year-old Chamomile Club label and collective. Their slogan is BKDI: Black Kids Doing It. “We’ve established an ecosystem,” says Monjola. “We’re musicians but also videographers, graphic designers, producers, stylists.” Chamomile act Moio crossed over with 2024 single Moments, topping Spotify’s Viral 50. “The Black Irish experience is super unique,” Monjola adds. “We don’t have a blueprint, so we’re following our gut – and that’s resonating.”‘We just want to stop people being murdered’: Kneecap on Palestine, protest and provocationRead moreBallymun-founded rap group Bricknasty blend hip-hop, neo-soul, rave and garage with lyrics in Gaelic – their single Is é a Locht a Laghad is a stark track about heritage and hardship. Frontman Fatboy says he was “eating curry-paste wraps because I couldn’t buy chicken” – until they supported Coldplay at Dublin’s Croke Park as the backing band for Irish singer Aby Coulibaly, and put together their recent mixtape Black’s Law. They’re now getting ready for their first US headline tour in February. “You get a false sense of being class playing in Ireland, because the crowds are so deadly [good],” Fatboy says. “Sometimes what you need is to get ribbed. That’s how you learn.” They’ve won plenty of audiences over, though: “Seeing people elsewhere respond because they’ve gone through similar things is magical.”Breakthroughs such as theirsare far from being a given, and artists from bigger cities tend to get more opportunities, but arts centres such as the Duncairn in Belfast encourage cross-border collaboration, creating fertile ground for agents and labels to scout.View image in fullscreen‘We’re following our gut’ … Monjola perform at Cork Opera House, 2025.Photograph: Kieran Frost/RedfernsAnother huge boost came in October, when the Irish government announced that a pilot basic-income scheme for artists would become permanent. Public support has been strong, and anindependent studyfrom Alma Economics found it improved recipients’ creative productivity and mental wellbeing. With artists receiving €325 (£286) a week, the pilot schemecost €25ma year, a relatively small investment to keep an entire arts scene thriving. Daniel “Lango” Lang of the Scratch says high youth unemployment once drove them to music: “The big challenge for young artists now is the cost of living, but a thriving scene breeds confidence.”That confidence isn’t just firing up this new generation of acts – it’s changing the way Irish people think about themselves. “As a people, we are very self-effacing,” NewDad’s Dawson says. “We feel sincerely thankful – and even surprised – that people show up for us. I never thought a band formed by a bunch of teenagers in Galway would one day stand up on a big stage in Japan.”Everyone I speak to has someone else to hype up, be it dream-pop and the Cure support act Just Mustard, folk collective Madra Salach, ambient artist Saoirse Miller or alt-rapper Khakikid. “We’re so proud of ourselves,” Dawson says. “Which is hard to say as an Irish person.”Explore more on these topicsMusicPop and rockIndieMetalHip-hopRapFolk musicfeaturesShareReuse this content"

For while Erpenbeck adopted some of the features of the form – apparently throwaway observations on daily life, such as minor irritation at the difficulty of sourcing propersplitterbrötchen, an unpretentious pastry now pimped for a more elaborate and wealthy clientele – she consistently enlarged and complicated it. Into that recognisable tone of ennui and mild querulousness with which journalists hope to woo a time-pressed but disenchanted or nostalgic readership, Erpenbeck smuggled metaphysics, politics and history.As in her fiction, her attention is drawn to the irrefutable power of contingency. As a child and adolescent, she was an East German; entering adulthood, she finds that her country no longer exists and that personal, family, social and political histories have been compressed into the suddenly appearing moment. If the collapse of the Berlin Wall was an easily grasped symbol, dramatic in its intensity and immediacy, what happened to the places and the people in the hours, days and years that followed? Put in more abstract philosophical terms, what is the status of an object after it has disappeared, a person after they have died, a renamed and reconfigured state, an altered identity?Contingency tells us that it depends. Thatsplitterbrötchen, for example: a sweet, plain item “rather jumbled up, as if the baker had stuck all the leftover scraps of dough together” is now a far more refined affair, involving layers of puff pastry, techniques and processes, a thumb pressed into the dough “to let air in”. “Air!?!” exclaims Erpenbeck. “For the first time, it strikes me that the worddisappearhas something active at its core, that there is a perpetrator in the word.”The pieces are necessarily short, and Erpenbeck leaves the reader to flesh out what she implies and only occasionally makes more explicit, as in the question of the disappearing drip-catcher – a once ubiquitous and low-tech gadget deployed to save East German tablecloths from coffee spills, now made obsolete as coffee pots have been replaced by Italian espresso-makers.These domestic concerns are inflected with irony and humour, but several of the pieces address larger and more significant absences. When Erpenbeck visits the site of the Warsaw Ghetto, describing the modern hotel where “glass elevators go up and down inside a glass tube” and chestnut trees flourish only in areas beyond the rebuilt zone, she reveals a memorable detail: that “there’s often a small slope to the right and left of the sidewalk, overgrown with grass and bushes, and the buildings themselves sit a bit higher”, because they have been constructed on the rubble and the foundations of old houses burnt to the ground by the Germans.‘They disappeared when the wall came down’: German author Jenny Erpenbeck on the objects that contain vast historiesRead moreWriting in miniature demands the exemplary and the material: something concrete to conjure a picture, to anchor a thought. But Erpenbeck is just as concerned with how such profound alterations affect intellect and emotion, how they redraw mental landscapes and interior life. Recalling people that she has lost – “R.”, whose fully charged shaver she collected from the hospital the day after his death, or her grandmother’s gnarled hands – she considers how her instinct to preserve is taking shape. She is forming a habit, she tells us, of trying to capture aspects of the “perfectly alive” people around her and imagining them as pieces of film, “as if I could select my memories in advance and learn them by heart, so that I could be sure to recall them later”.Things That Disappear: Reflections and Memories by Jenny Erpenbeck and translated by Kurt Beals is published by Granta (£12.99).

I was sitting cross-legged on the grey carpet, in 1977, when I finished reading whichever of Enid Blyton’s brilliantSecret Sevenmysteries contains the mind-blowing (genuinely, for a six-year-old) twist that “Emma Lane” turns out to be a road and not a person.My favourite book growing upUp to the age of 12, Blyton’s Secret Seven and Five Find-Outers mysteries; from 12 onwards, it wasAgatha Christie. Growing up, I was certain that no other kind of story could ever hope to be as satisfying as the very best mystery story.The book that changed me as a teenagerWhen I was 15, my father suggested, forcefully, that I ought to read, as well as the mystery books I loved, other books that were more serious. I found a harrowing memoir in Didsbury library by the actor Frances Farmer, called Will There Really Be a Morning?, about being forcibly committed to an asylum and kept there for years against her will. Her story of how she struggled to survive and make sense of her horrendous experiences was truly inspiring and unforgettable.The writer who changed my mindThe life coach and self-help writer Brooke Castillo, author of Self Coaching 101 and It Was Always Meant to Happen That Way. I had no idea that my thoughts about facts were a very different thing from the facts themselves, or that we can choose to tell whatever story we want to, and find plausible, about any given set of circumstances.The book that made me want to be a writerI remember it vividly: Sisters and Strangers by Helen van Slyke. It’s no accident that the first novel I ever wrote (mercifully unpublished) was called Lovers and Losers.The bookI came back toEmily Brontë’s Wuthering Heights. I gave it up three times after finding it too hard-going – now it’s one of my all-time top five novels.The book I rereadThere are two novels –The Black Princeby Iris Murdoch andComing from Behind by Howard Jacobson– that I reread regularly because I just adore them. They are perfection expressed in fiction. The Jacobson is the funniest book I’ve ever read and makes me weep with laughter, and the Murdoch is her masterpiece – a detective novel wrapped in a bizarre love story. It’s also the best dissection of creative ambition and literary rivalries that I’ve ever read.The book I could never read againA Prayer for Owen Meany. For some reason, this breathtaking novel rendered me unable to contemplate reading it again, or reading anything else by John Irving.The book I discovered  later in lifeAgatha Christie’s Mary Westmacott novelThe Rose and the Yew Tree– every bit as suspenseful as her “Agatha” novels.The book I am currently readingThe forthcomingWitch Trialby Harriet Tyce – a bold and unpredictable murder mystery that has a vice-like grip. So suspenseful and chilling – in the best possible way.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

The show will begin with Joyce as the teenage time-traveller before Brauch takes over for the middle section and Dobson ends in the role. All three will then perform the final number, Back in Time, together.“Originating the role of Marty is undeniably the highlight of my career,” said Dobson. “To be stepping back into his shoes for one night only is super exciting.” Dobson performed the partat the Manchester Opera Housein 2020 and at the Adelphi in its2021 West End premierewhich was delayed by the Covid-19 pandemic. “It’s such a thrill to return to this production,” Joyce said. “I’m so excited to perform alongside both Olly and Caden – it’s not often you get three Martys on one stage!” Back to the Future brought Dobson an Olivier award nomination for best actor in a musical. Joyce received a WhatsOnStage award nomination for best takeover for his performance.Brauch began in the role earlier this year. Gok Wan recently made a cameo appearance as Principal Strickland in the show to celebrate Back to the Future Day on 21 October, the date that Marty travels to the future in Back to the Future Part II. The film sequel uses trickery to find Michael J Foxsharing the screen with himselfin a scene when Marty has a near run-in with his future son.Guest appearances at gala musical productions provide the audience, often comprising diehard fans, with a unique experience such as when five actors who have played Rafiki around Europe came together at the culmination of aWest End gala for The Lion Kingin 2024. Les Misérables celebrated its 40th birthday in October by bringing stars including Patti LuPone and Michael Ball on stage to sing a finale. Going one step further, Kerry Ellis, Louise Dearman and Rachel Tucker – who have all played Elphaba in Wicked – will tour together next year with a concert entitled Gravity featuring songs from their musical careers, including Wicked.When Back to the Future was released in 1985, theHollywood Reporterannounced: “The movie isn’t just fun. It’s fun at the speed of light, a whiz-bang time-travel adventure likely to result in some decidedly high-octane box office dollars.”Explore more on these topicsTheatreMusicalsWest EndBack To The FuturenewsShareReuse this content"

She arrived on a litter carried by topless men; he on a rickshaw drawn by female models. He presented her with a novelty-size lollipop. She handed him a piglet.“The Battle of the Sexes was always an opera,” says composerLaura Karpmanin the programme for the world premiere of the orchestral version of her stage work Balls. At its subtlest, the opera gets straight to the heart of how alien that real event now seems. Incorporating video clips of adverts and near-verbatim quotes of the 1973 TV commentary – virtuosically delivered as a kind of slow rap by actorEmma Kennedyin a wig, sideburns and shades – Karpman’s score transforms the shock of cigarettes “tailored for the feminine hand” and female athletes greeted as “little lady” into all-singing all-dancing kitsch.As the triple entendre of the title might suggest, however, much of this opera is not subtle – and subtlety isn’t the point. Moments of hope sound like Copland. Archive footage of suffragettes is accompanied by a brief splash of Philip Glass-style minimalism. Climaxes are Hollywood-ready, numbers are short, voices are amplified (occasionally to the point of muddiness during big choral moments).An Emmy award-winning composer for film and TV, Karpman excels at managing pace and keeping the audience entertained. (King herself made a video cameo at the start, assuring us we were “in for a treat.”) TenorNicky Spencewas the comic ringleader as Riggs, prancing and squealing through falsetto passages, whileLotte Betts-Deanwas smoky-voiced and soulful as King’s secretary and lover. As King,Nikola Printzwas a powerful, intense presence vocally and dramatically, their generous mezzo carefully controlled throughout amid finely sung smaller roles.View image in fullscreenKeeping the audience entertained … Laura Karpman’s Balls at the Royal Festival Hall.Photograph: Marc GascoigneUnderMarin Alsop, thePhilharmoniaalternated with ease between filmic lushness and gamely clapping along to spoken declamation. If they and the singers felt somewhat underused, that was partly due to the otherwise inspired choice to programme Walton’s Façade before the interval. “Fun”-forward music theatre of another era, Façade demands spectacular virtuosity for the rhythmic delivery ofEdith Sitwell’s text – delivered with aplomb by Printz, Spence and, above all, Betts-Dean – while the score showcased the Philharmonia musicians at the dapper, snook-cocking top of their game.Explore more on these topicsClassical musicThe Philharmonia OrchestraOperareviewsShareReuse this content"

While maids a-milking, swans a-swimming and the rest might plausibly be found in English crime fiction’s favourite setting of a village, co-writers Humphrey Ker and David Reed set the deadly dozen in Victorian theatreland, where a performer embodying one of the song’s elements (Mother Goose, Swan Lake etc) is threatened each evening.The era allows the mayhem to be investigated by Sherlock Holmes and Dr Watson, played respectively by the authors, with Ker and Reed seeming to channel the tall-short, wild-mild dynamic of John Cleese and Andrew Sachs in Fawlty Towers.The show also impressively offers a Christmas gift that only the most curmudgeonly theatregoers would resist –a great musical drama duo reuniting. After Tim Rice and Andrew Lloyd Webber professionally separated in the early 1980s, they wrote Cricket (1986), a private “musicalette” for the 60th birthday of Elizabeth II, a new song for the 1996 movie of Evita, and bulked out the score and libretto of Arlen & Harburg’s The Wizard of Oz for Lloyd Webber’s 2011 staging. But the seven new songs here, plus a variation on one of the composer’s instrumental suite Variations (1978), are their most substantial resumption, facilitated by the producers including two of Rice’s children.View image in fullscreenGleefully theatrical … Sherlock Holmes and the 12 Days of Christmas at Birmingham Rep.Photograph: Pete Le MayPerhaps inevitably, the collaboration feels nostalgic. The show’s urchins and street traders overlap historically and in a music hall-style score with the Victorian setting of The Likes of Us, the 1965 Rice-Lloyd Webber debut show about Dr Barnardo that was not performed until 2005. The in-jokey and knowing tone of the lyrics (Rice clearly knows his Conan Doyle) recalls Cricket. As with that show, the Sherlock songs will be regarded as a Rice and Lloyd Webber curiosity. The best of them are The Dead of Winter, an atmospheric mashup of yuletide and homicidal references, and, scattering puns like spilled rice, Houses Are Not Holmes, a Watson solo affectingly delivered by Reed.Ride the Cyclone review – teens sing for their salvation in cult musicalRead moreThe script, staged with gusto by Phillip Breen and Becky Hope-Palmer, includes nice anachronistic jibes against sexism amid numerous meta jests about Birmingham’s football rivals Aston Villa, crime fiction and theatrical devices. In a sharp ensemble, Helena Wilson’s rival private detective Athena Faversham and Deborah Tracey’s Queen Victoria excel.This is a big moment for Rice: this week, I saw the Broadway revival ofChess, his 1986 collaboration with Abba songwriters, which was musically glorious but confused in storyline. Conversely, this venture has strong narrative from Ker and Reed with light grace notes from British musical theatre’s most profitable pair.AtBirmingham Repuntil 18 JanuaryExplore more on these topicsTheatreComedy (Stage)Comedy (Culture)Arthur Conan DoyleMusicalsAndrew Lloyd WebberTim RicereviewsShareReuse this content"

The Composer series at Sadler’s Wells presents a night of new choreography set to the work of a single composer and this time it’s the turn of AmericanNico Muhly, no stranger to the world of dance.Three very different choreographers tackle his music: Jules Cunningham, Maud Le Pladec and Michael Keegan-Dolan. The first two have broadly similar approaches. The dance listens closely to the endlessly imaginative textures of the score and chooses when to mimic – a shake of the knees to match a vibrato string, for example – and when to diverge.View image in fullscreenSlinky … Siaska Chareyre in Veins of Water by Maud Le Pladec.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianCunningham’s piece, Slant, is set to Muhly’s Drones, based on long, sustained string notes, which set up a sense of suspension (and suspense) that is a great foil for Cunningham’s stark movement, with its flat planes and improbable balances. It’s turned into something mysterious, liminal, unresolved. Cunningham’s six-strong cast includes two children and the incredible Ellen van Schuylenburch, who danced with Michael Clark in the 1980s and brings a dancing life’s worth of experience and mettle.Moving beyond bar lines: composer Nico Muhly on dancers reimagining his musicRead moreLe Pladec’s Veins of Water has three dancers who look as if they have forgotten to put their skirts on, in sheer shorts and glittery tops, waves of sequins matched by a wavy motif for the string instruments and the slinky movement of their jellyfish bodies. There’s an eerie glamour about them, like a 60s alien girl group. They shift from being enmeshed with the music to forging their own track, all the time looking us straight in the eye. Beguiling.You get comfortable with one approach and then Michael Keegan-Dolan turns everything upside down and says: come into my world! One where American folk singer Sam Amidon is standing on a stool with a noose hanging from the ceiling and the dancers appear as skeletons doing jazz hands. Muhly wrote The Only Tune for Amidon in 2007, based on Scots murder ballad The Two Sisters. The simple folk tune is stretched out, blurred at all its edges and vividly coloured in (played by the Britten Sinfonia, also skeletons). Amidon is a still, constant presence amid the madness and it’s pure theatre, with a beating heart, an arched brow and a wicked glint in its eye. A show that’s worth waiting five years for.AtSadler’s Wells, London, until 22 NovemberExplore more on these topicsDanceSadler's WellsNico MuhlyreviewsShareReuse this content"

All the signs are pointing that wayBen ChildWill Quaritch, the square-jawed representative of military-industrial destruction befriend the Na’vi in James Cameron’s forthcoming Avatar: Fire and Ash? And if so, what other unlikely character about-turns should we be prepared for?Fri 21 Nov 2025 09.43 ESTLast modified on Fri 21 Nov 2025 13.58 ESTShareIt’s almost possible to feel a little sorry for Colonel Miles Quaritch, the main villain of Avatar. Imagine: first you’re sent light years from Earth to hang out with 14ft blue space hippies, then you’re suddenly dead. Then you’re resurrected as one of the 14ft blue space hippies. And now, according toJames Cameron, you might just be starting to realise that the giant tree-hugging freaks you’ve spent two films trying to erase are your kind of people after all.Speaking to Empire inan interview last week,Cameron revealed that the Quaritch we will meet in the forthcoming Avatar: Fire and Ash (although still played by Stephen Lang) is no longer the same person we first saw stomping through the rainforest in the original 2009 film. Yes, he’s a “recombinant” – a lab-grown Na’vi reboot of a man carved out of granite and patriotism – but he’s also going through a full-blown existential wobble after discovering in the last instalment that he has a human son, Spider. “Quaritch is undergoing an identity crisis,” said Cameron. “His interest in the biological son of his biological precursor form is all about trying to define, ‘Am I a completely new person? Am I bound by the rules and the behaviours of the person whose memories and personality I was imprinted with?’ It’s a true existential dilemma for him in the philosophical sense.”Cameron also asked: “At what point does he cross that line and realise he’s more Na’vi than he is human? He could connect, he could plug in – Jake wants him to. I don’t want to tell you where it goes, but we’re gonna see all this play out, because Jake would rather have this guy on side.”Avatar: Fire and Ash trailer teases planetary peril and a crisis of faithRead moreGiven Cameron is planning at least five (possibly seven!) of these films, it is perhaps inevitable that some of the main characters will oscillate between hero and villain over the course of the journey. But do we really want to see Quaritch sanded down from a human tank? Is the saga’s main villain really about to turn to the good side? And do we really want him to?It wouldn’t be the first time Cameron has flipped a character’s entire persona mid-saga. Arnold Schwarzenegger’s T-800 was a time-travelling death robot in the firstTerminatorfilm and a leather-clad babysitter in the second, while Linda Hamilton’s Sarah Connor followed a reverse trajectory from terrified waitress to the most intense mum who ever lived. And yet both those arcs made sense: the T-800 would always manifest according to its most recent programming, while it’s hard to avoid becoming a battle-hardened maniac when you’ve just experienced the apocalypse on fast-forward.But Quaritch may be the most villainy villain in the history of genre movies: a walking embodiment of humanity’s desire to punch nature in the face; a totem of the military-industrial super-complex. And to be honest, we kind of liked him that way. Now what? We’re suddenly meant to cheer for a bloke we once watched Neytiri skewer to his own power-loader like a human shish kebab?This impending redemption arc also raises the question of whether other key players might find themselves undergoing full personality transfers before the seven-movie series is up. For what film-maker, given 1,200 minutes to play with, wouldn’t choose to spin the entire saga’s moral compass like a fidget toy? Neytiri may decide she has always secretly loved rampant space colonialism. Spider could announce he’s joining the RDA for the dental plan. Norm Spellman might run off to start a Pandora-themed gastropub. Probably none of them will mind you – because unlike Quaritch, they know who they are. The recombinant, on the other hand, has room to become something else because he isn’t really Quaritch at all. He’s a man with the memories of the villainous human from 2009’sAvatar, but almost none of the biology, context or identity.The Terminator at 40: did James Cameron see into the future?Read morePerhaps this is the reason the RDA’s resurrected attack dog seems to be interacting with the new volcano-dwelling Na’vi tribe in all the early footage we’ve seen from Fire and Ash. If there’s a reason Cameron keeps hauling him back from oblivion – and we really have to believe there is – it’s because Quaritch is the narrative cipher the saga can still reshape. He’s the one character who can plausibly stand between the species rather than fully belong to either one. Which means he might hold the key to whatever future Pandora is heading toward – not the tidy ending where the humans pack up and go home, nor the absolutist fantasy where the Na’vi win every fight for ever, but something messier, stranger, and shared, dancing together among the floating bioluminescent jellyfish.Explore more on these topicsFilmWeek in geekAvatarJames CameronScience fiction and fantasy filmscommentShareReuse this content"

It was LSO Futures at its best, with three world premieres – two of them commissioned by the far-sighted Helen Hamlyn Panufnik Composers’ Scheme, now in its 20th year – and featuring South Korean pianistSeong-Jin Choas part of his LSO Artist Portrait series.Taking its name from the Hebrew for “carvings”, Omri Kochavi’s Gilufim is a likable work, its limber profile hewn from a denser original. Discordant orchestral slabs were whittled away by the insistent tap, tap, tap of an effervescent marimba. A nut shaker representing a crackling fire did the rest, the music emerging from the flames with a newfound harmonic solidity. Scott’s unsettling Sly featured woozy wodges of sound interrupted by sinister slitherings and a panicky orchestral nightmare before a vibraphone chimed in triggering an uneasy state of awareness. On the podium, Maxime Pascal was the most unflappable of guides.View image in fullscreenUnflappable … Maxime Pascal conducts the London Symphony Orchestra.Photograph: Mark AllanDonghoon Shin’s arresting new Piano Concerto featured an astonishing range of orchestral effects, its split-personality opening movement paying homage to Schumann’s famously divergent musical alter egos. Cho, a human dynamo, was all over the keyboard, his virtuoso display depicting the wrestling match between Florestan, the impulsive extrovert and Eusebius, his polar opposite. The slow movement, a crushing funeral march, showed off his muscularity and manual dexterity, while the capering finale cast the soloist as willing protagonist in a surreal orchestral farce.The programme concluded with the grand finale to theLSO’s Boulez centenary celebrations. Rituel in memoriam Bruno Maderna is an intricate masterpiece in which seven verses and seven responses are played out by eight spatially separated ensembles of different sizes. Backed by an immense array of Chinese funeral gongs, Pascal, who worked closely with Boulez, directed the instrumental groups with the assurance of a traffic cop. A sad work, yes, but with its extraordinary palette of colour and light it was a fitting and compelling tribute to a deeply respected artist.Explore more on these topicsClassical musicLondon Symphony OrchestrareviewsShareReuse this content"

Attendance, broadcast and streaming viewership are at all time highs. So is the prize money, which is attracting more and more young athletes seeking a chance to make a name for themselves.But while rodeo is booming, athlete development remains antiquated.“The sport of rodeo is decades behind.” said Doug Champion, 36, founder of Optimal Performance Academy, a new rodeo school working to modernize athlete development in a sport whose frontier roots and culture of rugged individualism has been slow to adopt modern sports science. “It’s always been ‘rodeo cowboy,’ we are just now entering the chapter of the ‘rodeo athlete.’”Historically, there has been very little money to support anyone outside the very top rodeo athletes, which fostered a culture that prized tradition and toughness, as opposed to exploring innovation in their sport.View image in fullscreenJoe Ernst, head of rider development at the PBR, the world’s largest rodeo league, shows Matt Gordon how to work the chain to test pull-strength.View image in fullscreenColt Morrow undergoes sensorimotor testing with the VALD Performance team.View image in fullscreenSports biomechanist Kait Jackson and Joe Ernst, head of rider development at the PBR, watch as a rider captures his vertical jump for the VALD performance testing system.View image in fullscreenThe technology creates a benchmark simulation of each athlete, allowing them to see and address sport-specific weaknesses.“There’s a sense of being an outlaw, renegade, individualistic,” said Cody Custer, now 60, winner of the 1992 PRCA World Championship, and a teacher at the workshop. “I’m gonna just plug up and do my own thing and win this thing, as opposed to being oriented towards the organization, team sports, etc.”Rodeo athletes have traditionally come from ranching and farming families, which have always been medically under-served. These communities, says Champion, rarely went to the doctor and took pride in just “cowboying up” despite injuries or health issues. Young riders coming from these communities never expected, or received, much medical or performance-oriented care.“It was just a different way of thinking, no preparation, no taking care of your body, and if you’re hurt, sick or tired it doesn’t matter because being a cowboy is about being tough,” said Champion.View image in fullscreenPerformance coach Chase Dougherty tries to destabilize Dalton Dwyer on the bucking bull, a piece of training equipment meant to simulate the movement of a real bull.View image in fullscreenJose Ramirez grimaces during a strength drill.View image in fullscreenAttendees, most in their late teens and 20s, come from around the country to attend the five-day workshop.Photograph: Ilie MitaruView image in fullscreenMany rodeo athletes live out of their cars to save money.Rodeo athletes are largely freelancers, traveling on their own dime to competitions, hoping to place high enough to fund their next trip and entry fee. The vast majority of rodeo athletes still have day jobs.“Bull riding is a drug. It’s the most addictive thing that I’ve ever experienced in my entire life,” said Gabe Martin, 22, from Felton, Delaware, who works servicing public and residential ponds during the week and chases bull riding circuits on the weekend. “It’s engulfed my life and, and it seems I just can’t get away from it. “Optimal Performance Academy attracts young athletes from across the country to their week-long training camps. The workshops are a mix of theory and practice. The theory includes guidance on nutrition, attracting sponsors through social media, personal finance lessons, and goal-setting and visualization. The practice portion of the workshop includes performance testing, rodeo-specific workouts, practice on bucking machines and two days of live bull riding.View image in fullscreenThe riders take a moment for group prayer to ask for protection before the day’s riding begins.View image in fullscreen‘I think rodeo is stuck in tradition, and I think that people fear that with change will come loss of tradition,’ said Doug Champion, above, who founded Optimal Performance Academy in 2023.View image in fullscreenChampion partnered with a local stock contractor to bring 88 bulls that the riders will cycle through for the workshopFor their seventh-ever workshop in Decanter,Texas, Champion brought in an Australian pioneer in VALD, a type of performance testing which uses force plates, dynamometers, motion capture, and ocular and vestibular testing to measure a wide range of key metrics. The idea is to understand the strengths and weaknesses of each athlete, and then build personalized training programs off that data.This testing is ubiquitous across most professional and college level elite sports, but this is the first time it’s been used for amateur bull riders.View image in fullscreenWyatt Bowman falls off the back of a bull.View image in fullscreenRyan Jae, Braulio Barraza and  Jose Ramirez watch their fellow classmate.View image in fullscreenEd Huffman tries to untangle a rider’s leg from a raging bull.View image in fullscreenAlec Richardson celebrates a successful ride.“The biggest thing that we realized is nothing about rodeo that happens physically is normal or natural to the body. In no way shape or form through regular exercise patterns or everyday life are you going to improve your ability to perform in the arena,” said Champion.Champion, who was a promising young rider in his own right, broke his back in 2010 falling off a bronco. His long, painful road to recovery led him to realize how much more rodeo athletes could be doing to increase their strength and technique while riding, and build resilience to bounce back after injuries.“It was just get on as many horses as you can because if you get on more, you’ll figure it out sooner,” said Champion. “Well, I got on 300 horses and got my absolute dick slammed in the dirt every time and I didn’t learn anything.”View image in fullscreenAlec Richardson holds his knee in pain after a hard fall.View image in fullscreenA medical team and ambulance is on standby throughout the entire workshop.View image in fullscreenDalton Dwyer watches playback of his ride with a handful of coaches.Champion’s hope is to shorten the training time for young riders trying to break into the pro circuits, giving them more healthy years to compete and earn a living. Rodeo is notoriously brutal on the body, with most riders forced into retirement from injuries in their late 20s or early 30s.“It’s just a totally different approach than the trial by fire that has been the history of how you learn in rodeo,” said Champion.View image in fullscreenMatt Gordon takes a moment before his next ride.Explore more on these topicsSportThe Guardian picture essayPhotographyTexasUS sportsShareReuse this content"

Parmigianino painted a nude adolescent Cupid sharpening his bow, Bronzino depicted him pleasuring his mother, Venus. This is one of several paintings in which Cranach portrays the mischievous deity as a naughty boy who has got stung by bees while stealing honey. The meaning is none too subtle: love hurts. It has a darker sting than we might give it, though, because Cranach was a religious radical and Martin Luther’s best man. So it is sin that aches. But, in a daring twist, Cranach paints Venus erotically and seductively. So you too are stung by his art, should this nude happen to prompt any sinful thoughts.National Gallery, LondonSign up to the Art Weekly newsletterIf you don’t already receive our regular roundup of art and design news via email,please sign up here.Get intouchIf you have any questions or comments about any of our newsletters please emailnewsletters@theguardian.comExplore more on these topicsArt and designArt Weekly newsletterPaintingPhotographyArtExhibitionsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I vividly remember those new-fangled boxes being spoken about often, either dismissively or with delight. A rash of cookbooks followed, and dinner changed across the land. Fast-forward a few decades, and air fryers have become the same kind of kitchen “disruptors”, offering time-saving convenience and healthier cooking, but with the added allure of easily achieved, mouth-watering crispiness.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Since launching with a single-drawer design, air fryers have evolved. Sizes range from compact to XL, while drawer configurations can be double, split or stacked. Alongside air frying, many will grill, roast and bake, and some will dip to lower temperatures for dehydrating, fermenting and proving dough. One we tested features steam cooking, allowing you to whip up dim sum as easily as a roast dinner, while another included racks for cooking on four levels.Given that the air fryer market is so crowded, it’s worth seeking out the best style for your needs – whether that’s for the simple pleasures of homemade chips or to really shake up your meals.At a glanceBest air fryer overall:Tefal Dual Easy Fry XXL EY942BG0£119.99 at AmazonBest budget air fryer:Tower AirX AI Digital Air Fryer£55 at HomebaseBest single-drawer air fryer:Lakeland Slimline air fryer£69.99 at LakelandBest air fryer for chips:Philips 5000 Series NA555/09 dual basket steam air fryer£169 at AmazonBest two-in-one air fryer:Caso Design AirFry DuoChef£129.99 at Caso DesignBest air fryergrill:ProCook air fryer health grill£179 at ProCookBest compact air fryer:Ninja Double Stack XL SL400UK air fryer£188 at AmazonThe best slow cookers for effortless homemade meals, tried and testedRead moreWhy you should trust meWhile air fryers have made the transition from novelty to must-have in recent years, there’s been one in my kitchen for well over a decade, and it’s in daily use. I’ve been a consumer journalist for decades, and as well as air fryers, I’ve tested air-frying health grills and ovens, multi-cookers that can air fry, and everything in between. Anything I can make chips with is welcome in my kitchen. Hang around me long enough and I’ll fill you in on what air fryers can do, how they work, common issues, and how many I’ve tested over the years (about 50).How I testedView image in fullscreen‘My commitment to the cause has seen me peel and chip more than 7kg of potatoes.’Photograph: Rachel Ogden/The GuardianBy now, you must have worked out that I take testing air fryers very seriously. My commitment to the cause has seen me peel and chip more than 7kg of potatoes – which was just as tedious as it sounds. The internet is awash with hacks for peeling potatoes, including everything from worktop gadgets to peeling hot pre-boiled potatoes with your hands – and even (and I’m not making this up) power drills and toilet brushes in a bucket. I decided a sharp peeler was the best choice.Each air fryer was run empty from cold for one hour at 200C to rate its power use. Where available, I followed the manufacturer’s instructions for cooking chips. This is because the guidance is often based on the air fryer’s capabilities. Where there was none, I defaulted to 24 minutes at 200C. The same was true for onion rings – if there was a similar frozen food, I followed the suggested times and temperatures; if not, I chose 18 minutes at 200C.View image in fullscreenFrying tonight: the chips were scrutinised on their colour, crisp and crunch.Photograph: Rachel Ogden/The GuardianAny food that looked at risk of burning was removed before it did so, meaning one or two cycles were ended early. Finished food was assessed on appearance (colour and texture), crisp and crunch, and the consistency of the batch (such as whether some items were less brown than others).The 12 machines I tested for this article are either recognisably an air fryer or an air fryer grill. I haven’t tested compact ovens or multi-cookers that air fry because they don’t offer the same experience, such as the ability to shake or turn the contents quickly, and they often don’t have removable parts that are easy to clean.The best air fryers in 2025View image in fullscreen‘Anything I can make chips with is welcome in my kitchen.’Photograph: Rachel Ogden/The GuardianBest air fryer overall:Tefal Easy Fry Dual XXL EY942BG0TefalEasy Fry Dual XXL EY942BG0from£119.99£119.99 at Tefal£119.99 at AmazonWhat we loveA stellar performance coupled with cooking flexibilityWhat we don’t loveIt’s a bit of a worktop hog, so make some roomPhotograph: Rachel Ogden/The Guardian£119.99 at Tefal£119.99 at AmazonGiven that Tefal is behind the pioneeringActifry, it comes as no surprise that the Easy Fry Dual XXL is a fantastic all-rounder, excelling at both making chips and handling frozen food. It’s also Tefal’s largest double-drawer air fryer, providing a generous capacity for families and entertaining, and it has the company’s 15-yearrepairabilitycommitment to cut waste.Why we love itWhile I remain unconvinced of Tefal’s claim that this air fryer’s 11-litre capacity will cater for eight to 10 people – perhaps if they’re not very hungry – it ticks almost every box, making it my choice for the best air fryer overall. There’s a good temperature range of 40-200C, programs for common foods, and the drawers and plates are dishwasher-safe and feel robust.More importantly, it performed excellently during testing, with the only head-scratcher being its recommendation for chips at 180C for 45 minutes, which was too long. After only 35 minutes, some chips were already slightly overdone, but the overall result was lovely and crisp. Onion rings emerged beautifully browned – they were the best of the lot.It’s a shame that …most buttons are icons – my pet hate – making it a challenge to program without the instructions to hand.Size:38.5 x 45.8cm x 33 (WDH)Capacity:11 litresPower draw:1.154kWh = 30p an hourDishwasher safe:yesPrograms:fries, chicken, vegetables, fish, dessert, dehydration and manualTefalEasy Fry Dual XXL EY942BG0from£119.99£119.99 at Tefal£119.99 at AmazonWhat we loveA stellar performance coupled with cooking flexibilityWhat we don’t loveIt’s a bit of a worktop hog, so make some roomBest budget air fryer:Tower AirX AI Digital Air FryerTowerAirX AI Digital Air Fryerfrom£55£55 at Homebase£79.99 at TowerWhat we loveIts colour screen and presets make it easier to programWhat we don’t loveOutside of the presets, there isn’t much guidanceThe prices below reflect current Black Friday offers£55 at Homebase£79.99 at TowerChoosing a more affordable air fryer doesn’t mean compromising on features. Tower’s AirX comes with an easy-to-read colour screen; a deep drawer with enough flat space for a fish or steak; and six presets that use sensors and a bit of tech to take the guesswork out of cooking different foods.Why we love itRather than being a jack of all trades, this pocket-friendly air fryer specialises in fuss-free lunches and dinners more than general cooking. So if you love marinated chicken wings or a medium steak, this is the air fryer for you. The presets can be constrictive – for example, the fries preset is designed only for frozen chips – but there is a manual mode for more confident cooks.In testing, onion rings emerged perfectly crisp after only 12 minutes, the deep drawer accommodating 11 of them, and fresh chips were near perfect with consistent browning, crunch and bubbling. My only issue was that the touchscreen wasn’t always responsive with a light touch – but this might be a plus for those who dislike oversensitive screens.It’s a shame that …the drawer isn’t dishwasher safe, so some of the time you save with presets will be spent cleaning.Size:22.8 x 39.9 x 28.2cm (WDH)Capacity:5 litresPower draw:0.606kWh = 16p an hourDishwasher safe:noPrograms:chicken, fries, fish, prawns, cupcake, steak, manualTowerAirX AI Digital Air Fryerfrom£55£55 at Homebase£79.99 at TowerWhat we loveIts colour screen and presets make it easier to programWhat we don’t loveOutside of the presets, there isn’t much guidanceBest single-drawer air fryer:Lakeland Slimline air fryerLakelandSlimline air fryerfrom£69.99£69.99 at Lakeland£69.99 at AmazonWhat we loveIt provides plenty of cooking space at a great value priceWhat we don’t loveParts aren’t dishwasher safe, so you’ll have to clean by handPhotograph: Rachel Ogden/The GuardianThe prices below reflect current Black Friday offers£69.99 at Lakeland£69.99 at AmazonIf you don’t have much counter space and don’t want to compromise on capacity, Lakeland’s slimline model is a good choice. There’s adequate flat space inside for family-size meals, or up to 1.3kg of chips, plus an internal light and a clear window to check on dinner.Why we love itI felt this air fryer was great value for money, with a good cooking capacity for its price, and it was economical to run. Its slimline shape meant food could be spread out, and I was pleased with the results of testing. Chips were golden brown, crisp at the ends and fluffy in the middle, and the batch was consistent overall, while onion rings were pleasingly crunchy. I found the window redundant once it became greasy, but it could be useful for less oily foods. I also wasn’t keen on the button that needed to be depressed to open the drawer – but it might keep curious fingers away from harm.It’s a shame that …its lowest temperature is 80C, so you won’t be dehydrating or proving dough.Size:27.7 x 42 x 29cm (WDH)Capacity:8 litresPower draw:0.674kWh = 18p an hourDishwasher safe:no, hand-wash onlyPrograms:fries, seafood, steak, fish, chicken wings, pizza, bakeLakelandSlimline air fryerfrom£69.99£69.99 at Lakeland£69.99 at AmazonWhat we loveIt provides plenty of cooking space at a great value priceWhat we don’t loveParts aren’t dishwasher safe, so you’ll have to clean by handBest air fryer for chips:Philips 5000 Series NA555/09 dual basket steam air fryerPhilips5000 Series NA555/09 dual basket steam air fryerfrom£169£169.99 at Currys£169 at AmazonWhat we loveSteam provides more cooking options than a standard modelWhat we don’t loveIt’s big: not one for those with compact kitchensPhotograph: Rachel Ogden/The GuardianThe prices below reflect current Black Friday offers£169.99 at Currys£169 at AmazonOne of only a few air fryers that can also steam your food, the 5000 Series is particularly suitable if you want to trim fat from your diet – or if you dislike the dry textures that result from overcooking. Introducing steam into the mix means it’s possible to air fry, steam or use a combination of both for moist meats, bakes and reheated leftovers.Why we love itThis double air fryer offers a lot of versatility, and I felt it was the best air fryer for chips. It’s well built, feels robust and is easy to keep clean even without a dishwasher, thanks to the self-clean mode that uses steam to loosen debris. Programming can be puzzling at first – especially as you’ll need to download its manual rather than getting one in the box – but the food it cooked made up for it: crisp, perfectly browned onion rings and chips with a moreish crunch, fluffy interior and pretty consistent browning throughout. It’s frustrating that only the six-litre drawer steams, the three-litre one being limited to air frying, but you’re sure to get plenty of use out of both.It’s a shame that …if you live in a hard-water area, you’ll need to descale this air fryer to keep it in tip-top condition.Size:49 x 39 x 40cm (WDH)Capacity:9 litresPower draw:0.79kWh = 21p an hourDishwasher safe:yesPrograms:fresh fries, frozen fries, chicken, meat, veggies, fish, cake, reheatPhilips5000 Series NA555/09 dual basket steam air fryerfrom£169£169.99 at Currys£169 at AmazonWhat we loveSteam provides more cooking options than a standard modelWhat we don’t loveIt’s big: not one for those with compact kitchensBest two-in-one air fryer:Caso Design AirFry DuoChefCaso DesignAirFry DuoCheffrom£129.99£129.99 at Caso Design£129.99 at AmazonWhat we loveThe ability to become an oven makes it handy for entertainingWhat we don’t loveYou might have to experiment a bit to get the best resultsPrices below reflect current Black Friday offers£129.99 at Caso Design£129.99 at AmazonShort on countertop space? Caso Design’s DuoChef is a twin-drawer air fryer that can turn into a small oven. Think of it like a robot-to-car Transformer: slide out the divider that sits between the two drawers, attach an oven door, and you have another appliance altogether.As well as performing double duty, the DuoChef is packed with handy features. There’s an interior light, windows on each air fryer drawer for checking progress, a shake reminder, and a hold function so that both drawers finish cooking at the same time.Why we love itBeyond its transforming capabilities, the best thing about the DuoChef is how easy it is to program. While some dual-drawer models can leave you scratching your head, here there are just three buttons for selecting the left or right drawer or both.However, while it crisped up onion rings nicely in the allotted time, fresh fries were another matter entirely. After 25 minutes, the potato was still quite pale, with only light browning, and required another five minutes’ cooking time to reach any kind of crispiness.It’s a shame that …it’s pretty slow at whipping up chips compared with the other models on test.Size:43.5 x 38.5x 33.5cm (WDH)Capacity:11 litres (14 litres as an oven)Power draw:0.971kWh = 26p an hourDishwasher safe:yesPrograms:fries, steak, chicken, bacon, fish, vegetables, pizza, cakes, root vegetables, reheatCaso DesignAirFry DuoCheffrom£129.99£129.99 at Caso Design£129.99 at AmazonWhat we loveThe ability to become an oven makes it handy for entertainingWhat we don’t loveYou might have to experiment a bit to get the best resultsBest air fryer grill:ProCook air fryer health grillProCookAir fryer health grill£129£129 at ProCookWhat we loveThe flat space lends itself well to steaks, fish and kebabsWhat we don’t loveLots of accessories = more stuff to storePhotograph: Rachel Ogden/The GuardianThe price below reflects current Black Friday offers£129 at ProCookIf you find the flat cooking space of some air fryers restrictive, you can spread your (chicken) wings with ProCook’s air fryer health grill. It comes with a 4.5-litre cooking pot and basket for air frying, as well as accessories to turn it into a slow-cooking and steaming kitchen helper.Why we love itAir fryer grills aren’t always the most convenient for making chips from scratch, because you can’t quickly shake a drawer for even results. However, with the toss of a spatula, the ProCook ensured great consistency throughout its batch of chips. They emerged crisp at the ends and golden overall, with no pieces that overcooked and only one or two paler chips. Onion rings were crunchy and nothing stuck to the basket. My only niggle was that the settings could be confusing for a first-time user: once you’ve altered them to suit and hit start, the display shows the program’s default settings instead while it preheats.It’s a shame that …I found cleaning the basket and cooking pot a chore: it comes with its own brush for tackling greasy residue, and you will need to use it.Size:40 x 40 x 28cm (WDH)Capacity:4.5 litresPower draw:0.83kWh = 22p an hourDishwasher safe:no (basket and pot)Programs:air fry, roast, broil, bake, dehydrate, slow cook, grill, griddle, stew, steam, keep warm, manualProCookAir fryer health grill£129£129 at ProCookWhat we loveThe flat space lends itself well to steaks, fish and kebabsWhat we don’t loveLots of accessories = more stuff to storeBest compact air fryer:Ninja Double Stack XL SL400UK air fryerNinjaDouble Stack XL SL400UK air fryerfrom£188£188 at Ninja£188 at AmazonWhat we loveThere’s great capacity in a compact footprintWhat we don’t loveIt could be too tall to tuck it below units when not in usePhotograph: Rachel Ogden/The GuardianPrices below reflect current Black Friday offers£188 at Ninja£188 at AmazonNo article about air fryers would be complete without Ninja, which has given the world models in all shapes and sizes – most notably its stacked designs. The Double Stack XL offers capacity without a huge worktop footprint, thanks to its twin 4.75-litre drawers and a pair of racks that double its flat area, allowing you to cook four layers of food. Ideal for families, newbies and those struggling to squeeze in an air fryer.Why we love itNinja’s air fryers always come packed with guidance and recipes, and the Double Stack XL is no exception. These serve to underline how versatile it is: you could cook two whole chickens at the same time, for example – great if your barbecue’s rained off. It’s incredibly easy to program and adjust as it cooks – and the top temperature of 240C is perfect for crisping food from the freezer. That said, some of its recommended times and temperatures might be a bit off. After 26 minutes at 200C, some chips were still pale and soft, which suggests they’d need longer. There were similar results from the onion rings, which after 18 minutes didn’t have the crisp and crunch produced by the other machines.It’s a shame that …its results didn’t impress me as much as Ninja’s other air fryers have – you may need to tweak settings.Size:28 x 47 x 38.5cm (WDH)Capacity:9.5 litresPower draw:1.049kWh = 28p an hourDishwasher safe:yes – but hand-washing recommended to extend lifespanPrograms:air fry, max crisp, roast, bake, dehydrate, reheatNinjaDouble Stack XL SL400UK air fryerfrom£188£188 at Ninja£188 at AmazonWhat we loveThere’s great capacity in a compact footprintWhat we don’t loveIt could be too tall to tuck it below units when not in useThe best of the restView image in fullscreenThe Instant Pot Vortex Plus ClearCook VersaZone, Tower Vortx Colour, Salter Fuzion and Russell Hobbs SatisFry multi-cooker.Photograph: Rachel Ogden/The GuardianFritaire the self-cleaning glass bowl air fryerFritaireThe self-cleaning glass bowl air fryerfrom£152.15£154 at B&Q£152.15 at AmazonWhat we loveIt’s seriously stylish and looks fab lit upWhat we don’t loveIt’s not nearly as convenient as a standard modelPrices below reflect current Black Friday offers£154 at B&Q£179 (£152.15 for Prime members) at AmazonBest for:avoiding nonstick coatingsHate the boxy look of air fryers? Or perhaps you crave crispy chips but have doubts about BPA, Teflon or Pfas? If so, there’s the Fritaire. Equipped with a stainless-steel grill stand, rotating tumbler for fries and a rotisserie for chicken, it looks as if a halogen cooker and an air fryer got together and had a baby. Plus, there’s a choice of bright colours for those who can’t stand black.There’s much here to like – a “self-cleaning” function that keeps the glass bowl from becoming greasy, good visibility to check progress, and if you’re using the tumbler, no need to shake fries – but there are downsides. I found the display hard to read in bright light, and the tumbler capacity is only 500g: loading it with chips was awkward compared with tossing them in a drawer. Plus, while onion rings emerged crisp and brown from the stand, the chips were anything but. While the batch was consistent, the chips were mostly soft and slightly chewy.It didn’t make the final cut because …the exterior grows extremely hot during cooking, and stays hot for some time after.Size:34 x 26 x 33cm (WDH)Capacity:4.7 litres (0.5kg max capacity of food using stand/tumbler)Power draw:0.65kWh = 17p an hourDishwasher safe:yes, accessories onlyPrograms:frenchfries, steak, chicken, seafood, bake, dehydrateFritaireThe self-cleaning glass bowl air fryerfrom£152.15£154 at B&Q£152.15 at AmazonWhat we loveIt’s seriously stylish and looks fab lit upWhat we don’t loveIt’s not nearly as convenient as a standard modelSalter Fuzion dual air fryerSalterFuzion dual air fryer£99£99 at AsdaWhat we loveLots of capacity and cooking flexibility for the priceWhat we don’t loveYou might need to test and adjust for the best resultsPhotograph: Rachel Ogden/The Guardian£99 at AsdaBest for:families on a budgetIf you’re feeding many mouths, you’ll need a big air fryer. Salter’s Fuzion offers a lot of space at an affordable price – and thanks to the eight-litre drawer’s divider, you can air fry two foods at the same time. Alternatively, with the divider in place, you can just use half the air fryer: perfect for snacks. However, like other air fryers with dividers, it has issues with shaking: both types of food will be tossed around, and larger drawers are harder to shake.I was disappointed with the level of browning on the chips and found that the onion rings weren’t quite as crisp as they should be. Keeping its clear window grease-free may be a challenge, too.It didn’t make the final cut because …the drawer doesn’t feel as durable as it should be for this type of air fryer: its metal is thin enough to flex.Size:36.4 x 38 x 32cm (WDH);capacity:8 litres;power draw:0.912kWh = 24p an hour;dishwasher safe:no;programs:manual, chips, shellfish, steak, pork, bake, chicken, vegetablesSalterFuzion dual air fryer£99£99 at AsdaWhat we loveLots of capacity and cooking flexibility for the priceWhat we don’t loveYou might need to test and adjust for the best resultsInstant Pot Vortex Plus ClearCook VersaZone air fryerInstant PotVortex Plus ClearCook VersaZone air fryerfrom£85.49£139 at John Lewis£85.49 at AmazonWhat we loveIt’s great at turning out crisp and crunchWhat we don’t loveProgramming an air fryer should be easier than thisPhotograph: Rachel Ogden/The GuardianThe prices below reflect current Black Friday offers£139 at John Lewis£85.49 at AmazonBest for:confident air fryer cooksI’m afraid Instant Pot commits one of my air fryer cardinal sins with its Vortex Plus VersaZone: there’s no instructions or guidance in the box, but simply a QR code that directs you to videos – I’m not a fan of forcing tech into the kitchen. The Instant Pot was also one of the trickiest to program (for example, you have to switch from single drawer to dual by holding its control knob), so it’s probably not a good choice for air fryer newbies.There are some good things here, though: two 4.2-litre compartments with a divider, the ability to switch to fahrenheit, and the option to turn off the beeps if they annoy. It also produced great results, and perhaps that’s the most important thing: plenty of crispy chips – though not consistently so – and crunchy, well-browned onion rings.It didn’t make the final cut because …the display is busy and hard to read in bright light.Size:31.4 x 38.4 x 40.4cm (WDH); capacity:8.5 litres;power draw:1.187kWh = 31p an hour;dishwasher safe:yes;programs:air fry, roast, bake, grill, dehydrate, reheatInstant PotVortex Plus ClearCook VersaZone air fryerfrom£85.49£139 at John Lewis£85.49 at AmazonWhat we loveIt’s great at turning out crisp and crunchWhat we don’t loveProgramming an air fryer should be easier than thisRussell Hobbs SatisFry air fryer & grill multi-cookerRussell HobbsSatisFry air fryer & grill multi-cookerfrom£82.99£119.99 at Argos£82.99 at AmazonWhat we loveThe pot is dishwasher safe – a rarity for an affordable applianceWhat we don’t loveYou might need to air fry in batchesPhotograph: Rachel Ogden/The Guardian£119.99 at Argos£82.99 at AmazonBest for:small householdsIf you’re unsure about how much you might use an air fryer and so want an appliance that does more to earn its place on the worktop, the compact SatisFry could suit. It may stretch the definition of a multi-cooker somewhat, lacking some of the functions you might associate with one, but its spacious pot can be used for air frying and other tasks, including slow cooking and searing.There’s not much guidance, however, and the results were mixed: chips were browned but soft and not very crisp, while onion rings were doughy with some singeing. I suspect both could have benefited from different times and temperatures. The other downside is that it recommends no more than 800g at a time for air frying, so you won’t be able to use all its space for this function.It didn’t make the final cut because …it’s not the easiest to program: for example, there are no separate up and down buttons for time and temperature.Size:37.8 x 32 x 28.2cm (WDH);capacity:5.5 litres;power draw:0.550kWh = 14p an hour;dishwasher safe:yes;programs:air fry,bake, grill, keep warm, roast, sear, slow cook high/lowRussell HobbsSatisFry air fryer & grill multi-cookerfrom£82.99£119.99 at Argos£82.99 at AmazonWhat we loveThe pot is dishwasher safe – a rarity for an affordable applianceWhat we don’t loveYou might need to air fry in batchesWhat you need to knowView image in fullscreenYour air fryer should be able to cook almost anything your oven can.Photograph: Grace Cary/Getty ImagesWhat can I cook in an air fryer?While air fryers have gained a reputation for turning out perfect homemade chips and crispy food from the freezer, they’re capable of far more. Not only can you “boil” eggs, prove dough and make yoghurt (if your model offers lower temperatures), you should be able to cook almost anything your oven can. As a rough guide, for oven recipes, set your air fryer temperature 20C lower (so if a recipe states 200C fan, set your air fryer to 180C). Air fryers also cook more quickly than an oven. The time can be reduced by as much as a quarter, so check food often to prevent burning.You can press your air fryer into service for every meal of the day.

Busy day? Curl up withair fryer chicken wings with baby potatoesfor a tasty supper or a sweet treat snack ofglazed chouxnuts.What features should my air fryer have?A good-quality air fryer is an investment, so check its programs, ease of cleaning and temperature/time range before you buy. There’s no need for the lower temperatures and long durations (usually up to 12 hours) for dehydrating fruit and fermenting yoghurt if you’ll mostly be using it for air frying, for example. Similarly, if you’re a keen cook, look for one with plenty of space – a small air fryer may soon limit your horizons.For those with a dishwasher, check that drawers and crisping plates are safe to clean this way, while if you’re cleaning by hand, robust nonstick coatings will make degreasing easier.The best kettles to save energy and speed up your cuppa, testedRead moreHow do air fryers work?Air fryers are best thought of as smaller, modified convection ovens with a fast fan. Rather than having the fan and element at the rear, these are above, producing powerful fanned heat that’s circulated around the drawer.Food sits on a perforated crisper plate, allowing heat to reach the underside, while a thin layer of oil on the surface “fries” the exterior to create browning and crunch. Shaking the contents in the drawer roughens up the surface, creating more area for crisping.Are air fryers healthier than regular frying?Yes, both because you need a lower amount of oil – a tablespoon should be enough to coat a 500g batch of chipped potato, while other foods require no oil at all – but also because the way food is “fried” is different.Conventional frying uses the oil in the pan to seal the exterior. This prevents moisture from escaping, which is then heated, steaming the inside. To do this, oil penetrates the food’s surface, meaning that more fat is retained than when air frying.Are air fryers ‘toxic’?Linger on social media long enough and you’ll find worries about air fryer toxicity. It’s usually centred on plastic parts growing hot (which, as it’s limited to the exterior of air fryers, rather than the parts that come into contact with food, shouldn’t present a problem) and nonstick coatings containing Pfas/PFOA.Most manufacturers have phased out PFOA (since 2013, all Teflon products have been PFOA-free), while potential deterioration of nonstick (which may use Pfas as this is a term for a large group of chemicals) tends to happen attemperatures of 260C and above. Most air fryers have a limit of 200C, with the top temperatures on others 240C.If you’re concerned about the safety of nonstick, choose an air fryer with a ceramic-coated pan and plates, or clean yours carefully: damaged coatings are more likely to release chemicals.Another concern linked to air fryers is about cooking starchy food, which produces acrylamide (a potential carcinogen). However, the same risks apply when oven-cooking food.Cooking oil at high temperatures can also produce potentially harmful compounds. Air fryers don’t use much oil, but if you’re concerned about this, choose an oil with a high smoke point (the temperature at which oil starts to smoke and break down), such as vegetable, peanut, sunflower or rapeseed.Do air fryers use less energy than an oven?Air fryers have gained a reputation for being economical, and while this is true for the most part, it won’t always be the case. For small amounts of food, air fryers use less energy, heating up quickly and only circulating hot air within a small space. An example, a A+-rated 72-litre oven might use 1.395kWh to cook a roast chicken over 90 minutes, while an air fryer could do the same job in less than an hour and use only 0.782kWh – almost half the energy and cost.However, if you were cooking large amounts, such as a whole roast dinner – chicken, roast potatoes, yorkshire pudding, roast veggies and so on – running several cycles of air frying would cost more, making an oven the more energy-efficient choice.The best rice cookers for gloriously fluffy grains at home: nine tried and tested favouritesRead moreRachel Ogden has worked as a consumer journalist for decades, becoming an expert unboxer before it was a thing, although she is much less successful at repacking.

I’ve always felt grateful that one of the things they passed on to me was a love of art. My dad,Alan Barlow, was a stage designer, a Benedictine monk and then, after marrying my mother, Grace – who was a GP – he became a full-time artist.In his studio in Norfolk, there were two big Victorian plan chests, where he stored paper and sketches he had created. He was also an art collector and some of the drawers contained artworks he had bought but didn’t have wall space for. For a long time, I didn’t feel ready to go through everything in his studio. I always felt connected to him when I went in there.But last year, after I moved from Norfolk to Cambridge with my wife and three children, we decided to sell my parents’ home. My sister and I spent days going through everything, and when I opened a drawer, I discovered a folder with lots of old prints.One was a faint 24cm x 21cm etching of a man in rich fur robes, sitting at a table with weighing scales, as a boy kneels at his feet and offers him a bag of gold. I recognised Rembrandt’s distinctive style. I knew that Rembrandt created such prints byetching drawings on to copper platesand then running the plates through a printing press.Although we were thrilled to find out how special the picture is, we still didn’t want to put it on our wallThe print was unframed, and my father had never mentioned it. But he had written on the mount that it was aRembrandtoriginal. I assumed that meant it had been printed from Rembrandt’s original printing plate. I wasn’t particularly excited about that: many prints were made from Rembrandt’s plates after his death, so they are not especially rare or valuable. Also, it wasn’t something I wanted on my wall, because the image was unfinished – the face was missing. So I asked myself: do I want to keep this? I thought: nah.I bundled it up and took it to a local auction house, Cheffins, to be valued. I guessed it would be worth a couple of hundred pounds at most.Experience: I escaped East Berlin in the boot of a carRead moreA few months later, I received an email from a Cheffins art expert. He explained that when Rembrandt was creating his famous 1639 etchingThe Goldweigher, which featured Jan Uytenbogaert, Holland’s chief tax collector, the artist would make preparatory prints before finalising the etching on his copper plate.When the expert inspected my print of The Goldweigher, he discovered the paper had a watermark of a Strasbourg Lily – the same watermark found on other prints Rembrandt made. Viewing my etching under magnification, he found there were black chalk lines around Jan Uytenbogaert’s face, especially around his hair, that were likely to have been made by Rembrandt himself. This indicated that the picture I had found was a preparatory print of The Goldweigher.That was a shock. It was so exciting to think that print I had found was something Rembrandt had worked on directly. My father was a great admirer of Rembrandt, and the idea that the artist had created a famous etching using a print that ended up in my dad’s studio felt very special.The expert said that the print was worth “well into the thousands”, which was surreal. My wife and I didn’t go crazy – we just treated ourselves to a nice bottle of wine. Although we were thrilled to find out how special the picture is, we still didn’t want to put it on our wall, and I am sure there are collectors of Rembrandt out there who will treasure it. It will be sold at auction on 3 December by Cheffins and has now been estimated to sell for between £10,000 and £20,000.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

But finding the Rembrandt has connected me back to my dad. There was such a strong sense of him in that studio that I was struggling to let go of him. Now, I feel the last thing he did was to give me this once-in-a-lifetime experience – and an extraordinary finalgift.As told to Donna FergusonDo you have an experience to share?

But this year it is also – once again – quietly enjoying a moment on grownups.In theChristmas advert for Waitrose, comedian Joe Wilkinson wears a duffel coat while in the supermarket with Keira Knightley. Footballer Cole Palmer wore one in 2024’s Burberry campaign, subtitled “It’s Always Burberry Weather”, and Tyler, the Creator wears a short one in the recentvideo for Darling, I.Meanwhile, Paddington Bear is sporting his on stage in the West End at the moment.Duffel coats are on the high street too, from a£279 cream designin Labrum’s range for John Lewis to a £64 checked design at Marks & Spencer,a fashion favourite.John Lewis reports that duffel sales are up 75% compared with last month, while searches on resale app Depop are up 159% in the last four months.The coat might seem genderless, but its newfound popularity is largely with men. Andrew Groves, director of the menswear archive at the University of Westminster, says this is part of a wider trend.“Menswear is shifting back to garments with clear origins and unambiguous functionality,” he argues. “[It] offers weight, insulation and a straightforwardness, which is what a lot of men want right now.”View image in fullscreenJohn Lewis x Labrum duffel coat, £279.Photograph: John LewisAlthough the coat is sometimes viewed as quintessentially British, the name actually derives from Duffel, a town in Belgium where the thick fabric originally used came from, while part of the design may derive from Polish frock coats. Duffels first became popularised when they were worn by the Royal Navy.The coat was a symbol of heroism in the second world war, as worn by Field Marshal Bernard Law Montgomery. The officer became so associated with the coat that it also became known as the Monty.In postwar years, it was sold at army surplus stores and became a favourite of creative and progressive types, worn by Jean Cocteau, young people marching against the Vietnam war and David Bowie on the cover of his 1977 album Low.A Depop spokesperson says the trend aligns with an interest in “heritage fashion”. “Traditional pieces that bring a touch of the countryside are increasingly being brought into street style,” they say.Despite their popularity, Teo van den Broeke, editor-in-chief of Esquire, believes duffels should remain on Paddington or in the playground.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFashion StatementFree weekly newsletterStyle, with substance: what's really trending this week, a roundup of the best fashion journalism and your wardrobe dilemmas solvedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I find it incredibly unsexy.”He acknowledges, however, that the duffel appeals because it ticks numerous boxes. “Men love things that function. They love things that have heritage. They love things that have stories behind them, garments that have been related in some way to military pursuits.”The duffel has long been a favourite of rock stars including Liam Gallagher, Graham Coxon and Alex Turner. Van den Broeke says the coat works for them because they “subvert” the duffel’s functionality.“It’s all about your attitude,” he says. “If you’re a musician, and you look like you don’t really care, then you could probably get away with it. If there’s an earnestness to your wearing of a duffel coat, it’s game over.”Despite his misgivings, van den Broeke is well aware the duffel is going nowhere. He describes the design as one of a few items of outerwear that “exist in the annals of sartorial history that can go on loop”.“It’s a classic because you can’t really reinvent it,” says Groves. “Whatever designers do to it, from Burberry to Prada, a duffel remains a duffel.”Explore more on these topicsFashionMen's coats and jacketsWaitroseRetail industryJohn LewisnewsShareReuse this content"

Instead, they look for baskets.Locally, this small brown stink bug is calledthangnang. Outsiders see them as an infestation but in the bamboo forests of Mizoram state this small brown bug has long been woven into the food culture.Drawing on generations of traditional ecological knowledge, the Mizo people have developed an intricate system of harvesting, processing and consuming the insects that not only provides high-protein nutrition but also helps control pest populations without harming the forest with pesticides.“We have been eating thangnang for more than 100 years,” says Salemkulhthangi, an elder from the Serhmun village. “I remember my father telling stories of how they used to collect it.”View image in fullscreenStink bug outbreaks happen during the mass flowering of bamboo.Photograph: Thejavikho ChaseThe big harvesting opportunity comes duringmautam, the rare mass flowering of bamboo (Melocanna baccifera) that triggers stink bug outbreaks. “There isn’t a fixed date or month; it’s mostly around September-October,” says Lalvohbika, a conservationist at Dampa tiger reserve in Mizoram. “But weather patterns are changing these days. In 2022 we saw them as early as May and then again in September-October.”Instead of spreading a sheet on the ground to collect the falling insects, as entomologists might, the Mizo have designed a fishing net-like implement with a long bamboo handle and a conical plastic pocket held open by a strong circular metal wire. As the flowering approaches, the villagers shake the branches, sending the bugs tumbling into the net. Once full, the bag’s narrow end is untied and the catch is emptied into gunny sacks at the base of the trees.Hot water is poured over to kill the insects, which are then cleaned and put in a basin where twigs, leaves and other debris are removed by hand. The cleaned bugs are soaked again in warm water, then ground into a thick paste that is processed into two valuable products: a fragrant cooking oil used as food and medicine, and a protein-rich paste used as animal feed.View image in fullscreenMizo people use a fishing net-like implement to collect the bugs.Photograph: Thejavikho ChaseThe taste, it should be said, is an acquired one. The stink in the bugs’ name comes from the pungent odour they emit when they are stressed or threatened. Scent glands in their abdomen produce the chemicals that are responsible for the smell. The people who customarily eat them enjoy the strong flavour, but it was a bit too strong for Guardian’s taste buds.The oil that appears as a top layer as the paste is boiled is carefully skimmed off, bottled and sold in local markets. Nothing goes to waste: even the pulp that remains after oil extraction becomeshmun hlui, a tangy condiment eaten with rice, and the leftover residue is sun-dried and fed to pigs.A litre of thangnang oil fetches about 100 rupees (roughly £1) in the market and is known for its supposed anti-ageing properties. The entire process, from harvesting to the final sale, is driven by the community’s traditional knowledge and their ability to sustainably manage and utilise their natural resources.These practices stand as a testament to how traditional ecological knowledge can guide innovation and reshape our thoughts about what we eat. As global demand for protein rises and climate change threatens food security, the Mizo way of turning a sporadic pest outbreak into protein is a reminder that perhaps the future of food lies not in modern laboratories but in the ancient wisdom of communities who learned long ago that “creepy crawlies” can also nourish and sustain.Yes, insects can ravage crops and frustrate farmers, but some of the creatures that chew through leaves and stems are, remarkably, more nutritious than the plants they destroy. Across India, several Indigenous communities have long approached such pests with a different philosophy, one rooted in coexistence and resourcefulness.As the entomologist Victor Meyer-Rochow once asked: “Why kill insects when they per se are nutritious?” It’s a question that resonates deeply in several villages in north-east India where even crop pests find their way into the cooking pot, not out of desperation but as part of a sustainable, seasonal diet that values what their land provides.Explore more on these topicsFoodThe alternativesInsectsIndiaSouth and central AsiafeaturesShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.At the risk of sounding like a British cliche, can we take a moment to discuss the change in the weather? This week’s sudden drop in temperature has our house excited for potential snow (the children are giddy), with everything suddenly feeling a lot more wintry. New coats are on the hooks, thermals are being dug out and a casserole dish filled with some sort of soup, stew or stock seems to be permanently ticking away on the hob. These range from quick, warming weeknight dinners to leisurely, slow-cooked weekend meals.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Whatever the time of year, I always have speedy packets of wontons and gyozas in the freezer, and cook them depending on how I feel (fried and steamed versus boiled and soupy). At the moment, I am craving warmth and nourishment, andMeera Sodha’s quickish vegan wonton souphits all the right spots; an added bonus is that it is a soup my children can get on board with, too. I rely on mybrothy braised chicory and beans(pictured top) to get me through working-from-home lunches, when I don’t have much time, as well as Rukmini Iyer’sspiced black bean and tomato soup, which is equally speedy and comforting.View image in fullscreenQuick and easy … Rukmini Iyer’s spiced black bean and tomato soup with avocado and lime.Photograph: Matthew Hague/The GuardianIf we have roasted a chicken on a Sunday, I always make stock with the bones that same evening, andMandy Yin’s recipe for chicken curry laksais the perfect way of honouring that liquid gold. Her laksas are one of my favourite things to devour on a chilly day, so I’m thrilled that she has shared her secrets with us, and that I can now make and devour them from the comfort of my own home.At the weekend, I cook heartier stews – and, if time allows, even indulge in a little meal prep. Any ofthese stews by Gill Mellerwould be welcome; I plan to start by making the chicken, chorizo, white bean, olive and preserved lemon number. And I have already shopped forFelicity Cloake’s perfect Irish stew, for my half-Irish husband and lamb-loving kids, picking up an extra-large jar of pickled red cabbage to go on the side. On a day when I know my extended family will pop over, I will giveRachel Roddy’s “sociable” fish stewa go, due at least in part to the number of pescatarians in our midst. While I appreciate that the name references the stew’s history and creation, rather than a claim on its ability, it’s worth a try, right? I love the idea of a hearty fish stew bringing everyone together on a cold winter day.My week in foodView image in fullscreenThe late, great Rachel Cooke.Photograph: Sophia Evans/The ObserverWhat I’m reading|I was never fortunate enough to meet Rachel Cooke, but was heartbrokento hear of her death. Like many food lovers, I adored her writing and witty observations about the culinary world, chefs, restaurants and more. Cooke’s 2023 bookKitchen Person: Notes on Cooking & Eatingcontains 50 of the best entries from her much-loved column in the Observer, and is a wonderful way to revisit her work.A touch of glass|I am a sucker for beautiful serve-ware, and am smitten with all of Ichendorf Milano’s elegant, whimsical glassware. Even just one piece would bring so much joy to any dining table. Thegiraffe and baobab jugis already on my Christmas list, as is thetomato tumblerthat I would love to live on my bedside table. Both are from Sous Chef, but you can also find Ichendorf stocked in many other places, includingJohn LewisandFortnum & Mason.My next meal out|Ever since I first tried Amy Poon’s home-delivery wontons back in lockdown in 2021, I have hungrily followed her journey from those wontons toaward-winning Chinese deli productsand restaurant pop-ups. She now hasa more permanent home, Poon’s, in the stunning surroundings of Somerset House in central London, and I cannot wait to try the entire menu. I’m particularly intrigued by thesiu yeh, which she describes as “a late-night meal in the food culture of southern China”.

Here, however, they take centre stage in a sparkling upside-down cake, and their ruby tones gleam over a tender, orange-scented crumb. The batter is enriched with soured cream, ensuring every bite is a balance of sweet, sharp and soft.Cranberry, orange and ginger upside-down cakeA note about the cranberries: if using frozen, do not defrost them first.Prep10 minCook1 hr 15 min, plus coolingServes8-10For the cranberry caramel base60g unsalted butter100g light brown sugar1tbsp fresh orange juice2 tsp finely grated ginger⅛ tsp flaky sea salt250g fresh or frozen cranberriesFor the cake batter150g plain flour1 tsp baking powder¼ tsp bicarbonate of soda¼ tsp fine sea salt120g unsalted butter, at room temperature, plus extra for greasing150g caster sugarFinely grated zest of 1 orange2 large eggs2 tsp vanilla extract120g full-fatsoured creamGrease a 20cm round cake tin (at least 5cm deep, and not springform), then line the base and sides with baking paper.Make the caramel base by mixing the butter, brown sugar, orange juice, ginger and salt in a small saucepan, then put it on a medium-low heat and cook, stirring gently, until glossy and bubbling Pour into the prepared tin, swirl gently to coat the base, then scatter the cranberries evenly on top.Heat the oven to 195C (175C fan)/380F/gas 5½. Sift the flour, baking powder, bicarb and salt into a medium bowl. Put the butter, sugar and orange zest in the bowl of an electric mixer and beat with the paddle attachment on medium-high until pale and creamy. Add the eggs one at a time and beat in well – the mix may curdle at this point, but don’t worry: it will come back together.Beat in the vanilla, then, on low speed, add the sifted dry ingredients in three instalments, alternating with the soured cream. Scrape the base and sides of the bowl a few times with a flexible spatula to ensure the batter is evenly mixed, then spoon the batter over the cranberries in the tin. Use a spatula to smooth out the top evenly.Put the tin on an oven tray and bake for about 50 minutes, until a skewer inserted into the centre of the cake comes out clean. Transfer the cake in its tin to a wire rack and leave to cool for at least 30 minutes.Carefully invert the cake on to a platter, then peel away and discard the baking paper. Serve warm or at room temperature with cream, soured cream or vanilla ice-cream.Explore more on these topicsCakeThe sweet spotFoodDessertBakingFruitWinter food and drinkThanksgivingrecipesShareReuse this content"

The little mountain villages are breathtaking, especially in the autumn when the landscape is painted in various hues of reds, yellows and greens. With truffles, porcini and hazelnuts too, this area is a culinary feast, best served in the early afternoon sun. This part of the Piedmont region always surprises me, especially because it is so overlooked by non-Italian visitors. Close to the vineyards of Barolo and the beautiful towns of Asti and Alba, it remains a hidden treasure.Ruan SmitWinning tip: explore Roman remains at your leisure, Le MarcheView image in fullscreenThe medieval village of Urbisaglia neighbours Urbs Salvia achaeological park.Photograph: Universal Images /AlamyEven the locals thought it was hot when we visited the archaeological park atUrbs Salvia, south of Ancona in the Marche region.

Some of them ran back to their houses and the only information we are getting is that the attackers are still moving with the remaining children into the bush.”Niger, the biggest of the country’s 36 states, runs west from the capital, Abuja, to neighbouring Benin. The incident in the early hours of Friday is the third documented mass school abduction in the state in the last decade.In the last attack in Niger state, in May 2021, 135 pupils were abducted from an Islamic seminary, six of whom died while being held.On Monday, gunmen stormed a girls’ boarding school in neighbouring Kebbi state, abducting 25 schoolgirls and killing the vice-principal. According tolocal reports, security forces had relayed information about the plot and spent the night guarding the school but left the scene early.“The heavily armed security personnel spent time taking photographs with the students, only to abandon them 30 minutes before the attack,” the state governor said. Afterward, Nigeria’s president, Bola Tinubu,orderedthe junior defence minister Bello Matawalle to relocate to the state to help with rescue efforts.No group has claimed responsibility for the attacks, but analysts and locals say gangs often target schools, travellers and remote villagers in kidnappings for ransom. Authorities say the gunmen are mostly former herders who have taken up arms against farming communities after clashes over strained resources.Africa’s most populous country is beset by multiple overlapping insecurity crises across its central and northern states, of which kidnapping for ransom is just one facet.On Monday, the extremist group Islamic West Africa Province (Iswap)claimed responsibilityfor the death of a Nigerian general in north-eastern Borno state. Iswap released footage of his death as well as WhatsApp chats about a failed rescue attempt.Earlier this week, gunmen abducted 38 worshippers from a church in Kwara state, Niger state’s southern neighbour, after a brutal attack that left at least two dead, according to church officials. The attack was seen by millions of people due to a live stream of the service that was taking place.The kidnappers have since demanded a ransom of 100m naira (£52,662) a person, a possible indication that the kidnapping was financially motivated rather than ideological.Why is Donald Trump threatening military intervention in Nigeria?Read moreRegardless of motive, the scale and frequency of the attacks and kidnappings has heightened pressure on the government as it endeavours to avoid an escalating diplomatic row with theTrump administration, which has classified Nigeria as a country of particular concern (CPC), a designation given to countries where the government is deemed to have engaged in or tolerated severe violations of religious freedoms.US lawmakers including Ted Cruz have helped spread claims of a “Christian genocide” being under way in Nigeria. Trump has since said that US forces could go “guns-a-blazing” into Nigeria if the country fails to protect its Christian population. There has been a flurry of activity on Capitol Hill and in the Vatican as the situation has unfolded.Jonathan Pratt, a senior official with the US Bureau of African Affairs, told Congress on Thursday: “Terrorists, separatists, bandits and criminal militias in Nigeria are all over the country, with ongoing attacks often deliberately targeting Christian communities.”Nigeria’s government has rejected claims of an anti-Christian genocide and says the victims of the attacks are from all faiths.On Wednesday, Tinubu announced he was cancelling planned trips to South Africa and Angola this weekend for the G20 and AU-EU summits respectively.Explore more on these topicsNigeriaAfricaTrump administrationUS foreign policynewsShareReuse this content"

The US has proposed a deal to end Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which it agreed with Moscowwithout the involvement of Ukraineor the EU.Washington has also been accusing South Africa for monthsof racial discriminationagainstminority white Afrikaners, who ruled the country during apartheid, which South Africa has vehemently rejected.The country’s president, Cyril Ramaphosa,told a press conferenceon Thursday that the US had had a change of mind about participating in the G20 and that the two sides were discussing what form US involvement could take. He had said earlier in the day that countries should not be bullied and that their sovereignty should be respected.The White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, hit back: “The US is not participating in official talks at the G20 in SouthAfrica. I saw the South African president running his mouth a little bit against the United States and the president of the United States earlier today, and that language is not appreciated by the president or his team.“The ambassador or the representative of the embassy in South Africa is simply there to recognise that the United States will be the host of theG20[next year]. They are receiving that send-off at the end of that event. They are not there to participate in official talks, despite what the South African president is falsely claiming.”The US does not currently have an ambassador in Pretoria, with Marc Dillard the acting ambassador or chargé d’affaires.Many South Africans reacted furiously to what they perceived as a snub to their country. The foreign ministry spokesperson, Chrispin Phiri, said: “President will not be handing over to a junior embassy official.”Ramaphosa had previously said he would hand the G20 presidency to an “empty chair”, but that he would have preferred to give it directly to Donald Trump.View image in fullscreenPeople in Johannesburg take part in a lie-down protest over violence against women to coincide with the G20 summit.Photograph: Ihsaan Haffejee/AFP/Getty ImagesThe 2026 summit will take place at the Trump National Doral Miami golf resort in Florida, which is owned by the Trump Organization.Analysts said the US boycott of the G20 was more likely to harm than help its global standing. Marisa Lourenço, a political risk consultant based in Johannesburg, said: “China or India in the past might get criticised for certain actions … Now the US is really being seen as the unreasonable one, because it’s becoming clearer and clearer that what it’s doing to South Africa is just completely misguided.”The G20 was founded in 1999 after the Asian financial crisis. It was envisaged as a broader alternative to the G7 for the world’s largest economies and the EU to try to find common positions on global economic and financial issues.South Africa has taken great pride in being the first African country to preside over the G20, presenting itself as a champion of issues important to many countries on the continent. These include high levels of public debt and how to get the most benefit from the growing demand for “critical minerals” used in green technologies and found in many parts of the region.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe Long WaveFree weekly newsletterNesrine Malik and Jason Okundaye deliver your weekly dose of Black life and culture from around the worldEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Ramaphosa, Brazil’s president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, and Spain’s prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, also threw their weight behind the proposal in a Financial Timesopinion pieceon Thursday.Jayati Ghosh, an economics professor at University of Massachusetts Amherst and one of the panel members, told reporters: “Wealth concentration is growing. Income inequality is also a result of that, but we found wealth inequality to be even possibly the biggest problem, because it generates also greater inequality of power.”Winnie Byanyima, the executive director of UNAids and another panel member said the independent monitoring body, which the panel compared to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, could be formed without a G20 resolution or US involvement. “It doesn’t have to start with a consensus, it can start with those who want to take it forward,” said Byanyima, who will address G20 leaders on inequality on Saturday.Protests over violence against women have been timed across South Africa to coincide with the G20. At midday on Friday, thousands of people lay down for 15 minutes of silence in memory of the 15 women murdered on average every day in the country.Explore more on these topicsG20South AfricaAfricanewsShareReuse this content"

The Nuxalk Nation said the “aggressive bear” remained on the loose and police and conservation officers were on the scene.On Friday, the province’s conservation officer service said the incident happened after the bear emerged from the forest and attacked a group of students and teachers eating lunch on a trail.The province’s environment minister, Tamara Davidson, told reporters multiple teachers “took great risk” when they intervened to protect children during the attack. “They were well prepared, and they were the true heroes.”Three children were taken to hospital after the attack, including two with critical injuries. An adult was also hospitalised in Vancouver. Seven others were treated in the community.Conservation officers worked overnight to find the grizzly but have not yet located the bear. Their initial findings of their investigation suggest the bear may have previously been injured.“I really need to stress how dangerous this situation is with this bear at large,” said Insp Kevin Van Damme, of the conservation officer service. “We are doing our best to locate this bear and to capture it.”Van Damme, who has worked with the conservation service for nearly 25 years, said this was the first time in his career he had seen a grizzly attack a group in this manner.“This is extremely rare,” he said. “We are trying to determine the behaviour and why the bear acted in the way it did … Thankfully, the teachers were prepared. They did everything they needed to do and they avoided serious injuries to others.”Nuxalk Nation chief Samuel Schooner said in a statement the community was “devastated” for those involved in the attack. “All individuals involved are receiving medical support and our priority is to ensure that they are safe.”View image in fullscreenThe First Nations reserve of Bella Coola, British Columbia.Photograph: Jimmy Thomson/The GuardianThe nation also said that officers were armed and patrolling the community, with more conservation officers headed to the area. The nation also advised people to stay inside and had quickly set up a ride service as a way of preventing people from moving around outside.Bella Coola, a community of roughly 2,100 people, sits at the end of a fjord along the province’s central coast. Its remote location and abundant food sources mean that grizzly bears are a common sight in the region, informally known as the Great Bear Rainforest.Veronica Schooner, a parent of one of the children, said a lot of people tried to stop the attack but one male teacher “got the whole brunt of it” and was among the people taken by helicopter from the scene.Schooner’s 10-year-old son, Alvarez, was in the class of fourth- and fifth-graders and was so close to the animal “he even felt its fur”, she said.“He said that bear ran so close to him, but it was going after somebody else,” Schooner said.She added that some children were hit with bear spray as the teachers fought off the grizzly and Alvarez was limping and his shoes were muddy from running for safety. Her son’s thoughts, however, were with his classmates.“He keeps crying for his friends, and oh my goodness, right away he started praying for his friends,” she said.Grizzly with checkered past swims miles to Canadian island – and into hot waterRead moreAcwsalcta school, an independent school run by Nuxalk Nation in Bella Coola, said in a Facebook post that the school would be closed on Friday and counseling made available.“It’s hard to know what to say during this very difficult time. We are so grateful for our team and our students,” the post said.Grizzlies, which have coexisted with the Nuxalk Nation for generations, have a deep cultural significance for many of the First Nations along the Pacific coast.Many of those communities were on the frontlines of a successful fight to end the trophy hunting of grizzly bears in British Columbia. The ban went into effect in November 2017. But First Nations can still harvest grizzly bears under their Aboriginal rights for food, social or ceremonial purposes, or treaty rights.Attacks by grizzly bears in the province are rare, but British Columbia has seen a string maulings in recent months. Three grizzly attacks have been reported around the province in the last couple months. Of the three incidents since September one was fatal: hunter Joe Pendry was attacked by a sow and two large cubs. He fought off the mother, who later died of her injuries. Pendry succumbed to his own extensive injuries three weeks after the 2 October attack.The Nuxalk bear safe program, which applies non-lethal approaches to preventing and mitigating conflict, also acknowledges that incidents need to be treated on a “case by case basis”.Explore more on these topicsCanadaAnimalsAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

Muldrow declined to comment.In addition to the Puerto Rico talks, people pushing the conspiracy have been interviewed by federal investigators for a federal taskforce in Tampa which is looking at Venezuelan drug trafficking and money laundering, four sources told the Guardian. The US attorney’s office in Tampa declined to comment.An investigation of this sort underscores how Trump’s justice department is becominga major weapon in the president’s efforts to rewrite the history of his 2020 loss – while potentially strengthening the administration’s case for military action against Venezuela.While there were a variety of conspiracy theories that helped fuel Donald Trump’s 2020 “Stop the Steal” movement – dead voters, stolen, fraudulent or forged ballots, and secret computer servers in Germany – the purported influence of Venezuela was always a central claim. It asserted that electronic voting in the US was secretly controlled by the impoverished regime, both by President Nicolás Maduro and his deceased predecessor Hugo Chávez.Venezuela’s top opposition leader claims ‘new era’ is coming despite lack of clear planRead moreNot only was it bizarre on its face, but a judge in Delawareruled it false in 2023, and Fox News, Newsmax and OAN later paid a total of hundreds of millions in total damages in defamation claims. At heart, the theory was that Smartmatic, which had the contract for electronic voting machines in Los Angeles, and Dominion, which ran voting in many other parts of the country, had been created or influenced by Venezuela to fix elections.The revival of the claim appears to bind together two themes: Trump’s consistent “rigged election” complaints, and his antagonism to Venezuela’s socialist regime.With a military buildup in the Caribbean and increased sabre-rattling from theTrump administrationtowards Maduro, the unfounded election-rigging theories could provide another rationale for military action against Maduro.‘Very receptive’How could a discredited conspiracy theory, be investigated as a plausible case by the US justice department five years after it first bubbled up?The story starts with two unique characters who claim to have been pursuing the election claims for years: Gary Berntsen and Martin Rodil. They have become sources for the Trump camp and ultimately for investigators and have promoted two major allegations about Venezuela, as the reportersSeth HettenaandJonathan Larsenhave written on Substack.The first themelinksTren de Aragua, the street gang Trump has designated as a terrorist organization, closer to Maduro. The other major theme Berntsen and Rodil promoted was the old voting conspiracy and the allegations that Venezuela helped rig elections worldwide.Berntsen is a former CIA case officer who came to the public eye even before writing a book in 2006 about his hunt for Osama bin Laden. “A formidable guy, a warrior, no question,” said one former official who knew him.Berntsen projects the plainspoken demeanor of an expert with field experience battling an intransigent bureaucracy. He is also a fierce champion of Trump and of an invasion of Venezuela.“I don’t dabble in conspiracy theories,” Berntsen wrote in a message to the Guardian. “I spent my life defending our country and constitution. I led many major operations and investigations and saved many lives.”He added: “The Department of Justice and FBI and key White House Staff are investigating and coordinating efforts to defend our system and charge those guilty of Stealing Elections and violating other laws accountable for their actions.”Rodil is a Venezuelan expatriate based in Washington, and says he has been a consultant to US law enforcement investigating Venezuelan crime for 20 years. A close associate of his said he specializes in recruiting Venezuelan informants and witnesses for US cases.The International Consortium of Investigative Journalistsreported in 2022 that Rodil was under investigation in Spain for extorting three Venezuelans there, trying to get money in exchange for influencing US authorities on cases. It is unclear what happened to that case.Rodil told the Guardian it was false, and said those who accused him were charged in the US.Even before Trump’s return to office earlier this year, the sources say Berntsen and Rodil have been feeding information, documents and witnesses about the voting claims to Muldrow, the US attorney out of Puerto Rico and to an organized crime taskforce called Panama Express, or Panex, which is based out of Tampa.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst ThingFree daily newsletterOur US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Muldrow has been very receptive,” one of the sources said of the voting allegations. That source said there had been multiple briefings in Puerto Rico.Muldrow is one of the few US attorneys to have kept a job after Trump took over the White House. First appointed by Trump in 2019, he stayed in office during Biden’s term. He is a staunch Republican and Trump supporter, say two people who know him. Muldrow spent a good portion of his career in Tampa, and one source who knows him says he has a good working relationship with Pam Bondi, the current Trump US attorney general. She was the Florida state AG while Muldrow was based in the Tampa US attorney’s office.Several sources said Muldrow had turned over information to the Panex taskforce which used to focus primarily on the drug flow from Colombia but was now targeting Venezuela as well.This is now the taskforce working directly with Rodil and Berntsen, they say.In response to detailed questions, Muldrow emailed the Guardian: “In accordance with Department of Justice policies, I am not able to provide you with a comment.”Georgia prosecutor to take over last remaining criminal case against TrumpRead moreRodil told the Guardian that allegations involving so-called election integrity issues were incidental to conversations with Muldrow, rather than the central point of the briefings. He protested that while one witness talked about Smartmatic and election integrity, that was not the substance of Muldrow’s interest, and he said Muldrow only heard a portion of the evidence involving faked election results.Berntsen wrote in a message to the Guardian that “indictments are going to be released in the near future,” and said he and his colleagues believe that “your goal is to discredit the claims against Smartmatic and Dominion, the entities linked to a massive criminal cartel that stole US elections and elections worldwide.”‘Trump knows they need to be stopped’Ralph Pezzullo, the co-author of Berntsen’s 2006 book, is a true believer in the conspiracy theories Berntsen and Rodil are promoting now.In September, Pezzullo published an e-book called Stolen Elections: the Takedown of Democracies Worldwide, which described the Venezuela conspiracy theories, and is based on the accounts of Berntsen and Modil and witnesses they introduced to Pezzulo.Pezzullo wrote that the US voting was a “system created in Venezuela – and still electronically linked to Venezuela – that is designed to steal elections by remotely altering results”.Pezzullo said he too had spoken to Muldrow about the allegations. Pezzullo told the Guardian that his phone call with Muldrow was set up by Berntsen and claimed Muldrow assured him that the claims of election fraud were correct.“They’ve been attacking the US with the election machines and with the drugs,” Pezullo said, of Venezuela. “Trump knows they need to be stopped.”Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationUS elections 2020Donald TrumpUS politicsVenezuelaAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

As part of their plan, the men had gained Haitian Creole language skills and began the process of recruiting people to prepare for the invasion.One of the men, Thomas, had joined the US air force “to acquire military skills relevant to the invasion plan”.The men have also been charged with producing child pornography, which could land them in prison for between 15 and 30 years if convicted.Guns, gangs and drought: how crime and the climate crisis are reshaping HaitiRead moreThe larger charge, federal conspiracy to murder, maim or kidnap in a foreign country, would land them in prison for life if convicted.According to theindictment, the two men began hatching the plan in August 2024 and continued with it until July of this year. They intended to purchase a boat, weapons and ammunition as part of their planned invasion, and enrolled in specific training schools.Weisenburg was arrested in July,according to a local Fox stationin Texas, which also reported that he traveled to Thailand to learn how to sail.Thomas had changed his air force station to Maryland to help facilitate his plan to recruit the homeless population in the nation’s capital.The case was jointly handled by the FBI, the US air force office of special investigations and a local police department.According to a2020 videoproduced by the UN human rights office, the island of Gonâve lacks “judicial personnel and infrastructure”, leading to complaints from residents that crime is not sufficiently addressed. The island is also said to be difficult to reach and cut off from the rest of Haiti.Explore more on these topicsUS crimeHaitiTexasUS justice systemAmericasUS militaryWashington DCnewsShareReuse this content"

Colombian researchers located the galleon in 2015, leading to legal and diplomatic disputes. Its exact location is a state secret.The San José was returning to Europe with treasures to help fund the war of the Spanish succession when it was sunk by a British squadron close to the Caribbean port city of Cartagena.The ship, known as the “holy grail of shipwrecks”, is believed to hold 11m gold and silver coins, emeralds and other precious cargo from Spanish-controlled colonies, which could be worth billions of dollars if ever recovered.President Gustavo Petro’s government has said the purpose of the deep-water expedition is research and not the treasure’s seizure.Colombia’s culture ministry said in a statement on Thursday that the cannon, coins and porcelain cup would undergo a conservation process at a laboratory dedicated to the expedition.View image in fullscreenThree gold coins recovered from the San José.Photograph: Colombian General Maritime Directorate/AFP/Getty ImagesThe wreckage is 600 meters (almost 2,000ft) below the surface.The prevailing theory has been that an explosion caused the 62-gun, three-masted galleon to sink after an ambush by an English squadron. But Colombia’s government has suggested it could have sunk for other reasons, including damage to the hull.The ship has been the subject ofa legal battlein the US, Colombia and Spain over who owns the rights to the sunken treasure.Colombia is in arbitration litigation with Sea Search Armada, a group of US investors, for the economic rights of the San José. The firm claims $10bn, corresponding to what it assumes is 50% of the worth of the galleon treasure, which it claims to have discovered in 1982.Explore more on these topicsColombiaCaribbeanAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

But it doesn’t stop at the water’s edge.In February, Australia brokered a new offshore arrangement withNauru, striking a deal to send members of the so-called NZYQ cohort – non-citizens with criminal histories – to the Pacific island. Australia would give Nauru more than $400m in exchange.So far, Australia has forcibly removed at least four people to Nauru, but the number could be higher, and their conditions inside the RPC3 detention centre remain shrouded in secrecy.When the new deal was publicly announced, the Nauruan president posted an interview online, explaining the arrangement to his country.Interviewed by a government staffer and speaking Nauruan, David Adeang emphasised those to be sent to the island had “served their time” in Australian prisons and were no longer subject to any punishment.Adnan thought he’d served his time. But one night border force raided his home to deport him to NauruRead more“Australia is trying to send them back to their country but they are not wanted back home,” the president said. “So we accepted them from Australia. They are not Australian and Australia doesn’t want them.”Adeang said Nauru had demonstrated its capability and willingness to resettle migrants during its history as an offshore processing site.“Even for the refugees that came here, they have the same history: some of them killed people, some of them are disturbed people. But they will not do that here, instead they will live their life as normal and be happy along with us all.”The president said those moved to Nauru would be granted 30-year visas and the right to settle and work in Nauru.“They will be living among us like normal free people … nothing stops them from working and being a normal citizen. They are also subject to our laws, they will also get the same punishment if they break the law.”Important public information for the Nauruan public. But vital too, for the Australian people who are funding and ostensibly supporting this arcane arrangement. A member of staff at the Australian High Commission in Nauru made notes: “taken hastily, for internal purposes only,” the government says.But getting a public translation proved troublingly difficult. The Nauruan government did not provide one at the time and has refused to since.Nauru is a tiny country – about 12,000 people live on an island roughly the size of Melbourne airport. About half the working population works for the government, which is dependent on Australian support. Nauruan society is close-knit and bonded by familial ties. There is no independent media, and little criticism of government.There are few Nauruan speakers in the world, and those the Guardian spoke with were reticent to provide a translation, fearful of being seen as disloyal, or of facing repercussions (for themselves or family members). Eventually, an unofficial and incomplete translation was obtained, but on condition of anonymity.The Guardian reported its translation at the time. That version has never been disputed by either the Australian or Nauruan governments.But extraordinarily, the government’s unofficial translation of the interview remains, somehow, off limits to the public.Responding to a demand from the Australian Senate, the government refused to release the translation it acknowledges it holds.“Disclosing parts of the information… would be contrary to the public interest on the basis it could reasonably be expected to prejudice Australia’s international relations,” Penny Wong wrote, defying the senate order to produce the documents.“In particular, this includes Australia’s long-standing bilateral relationship with the Republic of Nauru and our broader standing in the Pacific islands region.”The federal government has even sought – and won – a non-publication order on its translation and transcript notes in the federal and high courts. That order does not apply to the original interview itself or any other attempts to translate it.“It would be not be appropriate to release them and doing so would damage our bilateral relationship,” Wong wrote.The 10-minute interview in Nauruan remains online.A foreign president granted an interview concerning a contentious Australian policy and posted it online. But the Australian government – having translated it – refuses to release that document, saying it would harm Australia’s relationship with that country.This is an alarming level of secrecy, but not a novel position when it comes to Australia’s tenacious offshore policy.Australia is regularly referred to bythinktanks,human rights groupsandmedia outletsas the “most secretive democracy on Earth”. Successive governments have appeared determined to reinforce that appellation, particularly around its offshore detention regime.From the Howard government’s edict that “no personalising or humanising images” should be taken of asylum seekers, through Scott Morrison’s “we don’t comment on on-water matters” (exceptif there’s an election onthat day), successive governments’ attitude to legitimate scrutiny has been one of unbridled hostility.The Albanese government has has also refused to release the memorandum of understanding it has signed with Nauru, detailing the conditions under which the NZYQ cohort will be resettled, citing a lack of agreement from Nauru.It has also repeatedly told the Senate it would not reveal the details of a multimillion dollar “confidential bilateral agreement” it has signed with Papua New Guinea to hold asylum seekers and refugees formerly detained on Manus Island: “the release … could reasonably be expected to cause damage to the Australian government’s international relations”.What are people saying about our new Nauru detention deal? | Fiona KatauskasRead moreThat is, the Australian people are not allowed to know what is being done, with their money, in their name, because it’s acknowledged as being damaging.Journalists have been banned from immigration detention centres for conducting interviews with people unjustly detained: the government has even put up ‘wanted’ posters featuring journalists’ pictures inside offshore detention camps, warning asylum seekers not to speak with them.If Australia’s offshore processing regime is as uncontroversial as the government insists, why is nobody allowed to see it, to interrogate it? Why should we not know the translation of the interview held by the government?Explore more on these topicsNauruAustralian immigration and asylumAustralian politicsAustralian foreign policyAsia PacificanalysisShareReuse this content"

The storms in the US were linked to a phenomenon known as an “atmospheric river” – a long filament of moisture-laden air that originates above the Pacific Ocean and provides vital replenishment of reservoirs and snowpack along the western coast of the US. However, they can also bring destructive volumes of rain, particularly along coastal areas.Elsewhere in the US, parts of Colorado experienced some of their longest stretches of snowless days ever this year, with Denver surpassing its third-latest snowfall date this week after recording its highest ever November temperature of 28C earlier in the month. The warm temperatures and lack of snowfall have also forced ski resorts to delay opening until December.Severe thunderstorms affected much of northern and eastern Australia last week, with more than 11,000 homes losing power due to heavy rain, hail and strong winds last Friday. Humid tropical air from the north helped to fuel the intense storms across much of the region. Additionally, bushfires triggered by lightning were an additional hazard in the plains of New South Wales, exacerbated by hot and windy conditions.View image in fullscreenAn aerial view of Versa in Italy shows submerged houses after a landslide caused by torrential rain on 17 November.Photograph: Anadolu/GettyMeanwhile, heavy snowfall was recorded in the high-altitude town of Sukayu in the northern region of Honshu, the largest and most populous island ofJapan, with more than 1 metre of snowfall recorded. The intensity and depth of the snowfall was also notable for how early in the season it occurred with some records being broken. Heavy snowfall also affected parts of Hokkaido, the northern-most island of Japan.AndItalywas also affected by extreme rainfall this week, with mudslides resulting in two deaths in the north. The Torre River overflowed its banks after 25cm (10in) of rain fell in about eight hours, resulting in significant flooding in the town of Brazzano di Cormons, in the province of Gorizia near Trieste. About 300 residents in the nearby hamlet of Versa were also forced to evacuate because of the flooding of the Torre River.Explore more on these topicsEnvironmentWeather trackerJapanItalyAsia PacificExtreme weatherEuropeCaliforniaanalysisShareReuse this content"

Will Labor make the same mistake nationwide?Read moreWith the government desperate to pass the laws in parliament’s final sitting of the year, the environment minister, Murray Watt, is locked in negotiations with the Greens andCoalitionin the hope of landing a deal next week.Neither side supports the bill in its current form, putting the onus on Labor to cough up concessions if it wants to avoid the long-awaited reformcollapsingfor the second time in 12 months.The opposition leader,Sussan Ley,is willing to support the laws if Labor agrees to gut environment protections and strip back the powers of its proposed environment protection agency (EPA).Sign up: AU Breaking News emailA senior government source confirmed to Guardian Australia that, under a potential deal with the Greens, it would rewrite the proposed “national interest” test to prevent it being used to approve fossil fuel projects.Critical minerals projects could still be approved.Under theprovision, which Samuel initially supported in his 2020 review of the EPBC Act as a “rare exception”, the minister would be able to ignore environmental standards and greenlight a project if it was deemed in the “national interest”.While Watt has stressed the provision was intended for projects related to defence, national security and emergencies, the level of discretion written into the legislation has left him unable to rule out the possibility of exemptions for coal and gas.The Labor MP Ed Husic previously warned a future Coalition minister could misuse the power while Henry and Samuel both predicted a “conga line” of developers would lobby for special carveouts.Labor’s grassroots environmental action group alsocalled forthe power to be axed or at least subject to parliamentary oversight.As of Friday afternoon, the Greens environment spokesperson, Sarah Hanson-Young, and the shadow environment minister, Angie Bell, were still waiting for Labor’s options for a potential deal.The amendments would need to put forward in coming days to give both sides time to get a deal through their respective party-rooms early next week.The EPBC bills arelisted for debatein the Senate on Wednesday. Parliament rises for the year on Thursday.View image in fullscreenEucalypt forest at Waratah Gully in NSW’s South East Forest national park.Photograph: Auscape/Universal Images Group/Getty ImagesHanson-Young on Friday reiterated that the Greens wouldn’t support the legislation without extra protections for forests and the climate.Labor cast the Greens as perpetual “blockers” in the previous term of parliament, but Hanson-Young said the party wasn’t feeling pressure to cave to the government’s demands.“What plays on my mind is not allowing this government off the hook when they’re pushing for laws that will fast-track coal and gas,” she said.Ahead of Friday’s hearings, an alliance of major environment groups, including the Australian Conservation Foundation, the Wilderness Society and the legal firm Environmental Justice Australia, urged major changes to a bill that it warned “[does] not protect nature”.Among its suggested changes, the alliance called for the removal of new discretionary powers for the minister, the closing of loopholes for native forest logging, better engagement with First Nations communities, scrapping or limiting a proposed “restoration contributions” fund, consideration of climate impacts and reversing the decision to delegate decisions under the so-called “water trigger” to the states.The alliance also wants the federal EPA to be the main decision-maker on projects, with the minister only allowed to intervene in “exceptional circumstances”.Under the government’s model, which critics note is not genuinely independent, the minister would either make decisions or delegate that responsibility to an EPA official.Leaked Coalition talking points direct MPs to argue dumping net zero does not conflict with Paris agreementRead more“We call on the Labor government to substantially improve the bills and negotiate in good faith with members of the Senate that care about nature and a vibrant, healthy Australia,” the groups said.At Thursday’s round of inquiry hearings, the celebrated environmentalist and former Greens leader Bob Brown said the laws were an “insult to the environmental conscienceof Australia”.He said the absence of a requirement for decision-makers to consider a project’s greenhouse gas emissions – known colloquially as a “climate trigger” – was analogous to stripping a treasurer of powers over taxation.“And I say that must be taken seriously, because that’s how the situation is,” he said.Explore more on these topicsEnvironmentAustralian GreensCoalitionAustralian politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Politicians and the media are spent and the sausage-making process can get a little rough.So it was at the end of 2024, as Labor moved to clear the decks with an election looming and rumours of a summer campaign spreading. On the last sitting day alone,more than 30 billswent through the Senate, including reforms to the Reserve Bank – and Labor’s landmark social media ban for under-16s, now just weeks away.But one major priority was thrown overboard. A deal negotiated with the Greens on environmental law reforms was junked by Anthony Albanese, after the WA premier, Roger Cook, warned it wasa political stink bombin Western Australia.Fast forward 12 months – with Labor re-elected in a canter and the Coalition left demoralised – and the environment minister, Murray Watt, has crafted a new set of changes to the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation (EPBC) Act, with their fate emerging as a key test for Canberra’s final week.ForSussan Ley– who is determined to hang on as opposition leader into 2026 – helping Labor get the plan over the line before Thursday night looks like a test of both credibility and authority.It is one she can’t afford to fail.Watt has been clear for weeks that he intends to make a deal before Christmas, and he is prepared to negotiate with either the Coalition or the Greens. Business wants a deal done, even as environmental campaigners warn the legislation risks making the failings of the current Howard-era environment laws worse. The bill’s “nature positive” moniker is long gone.Seeking to secure her position afterthe Coalition’s monumental backflipon support for net zero carbon emissions by 2050, Ley enters the final sitting days endangered, but likely not at imminent risk of a challenge.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailOn Friday, she went public with an offer to Labor to pass the EPBC bill provided the government agreed to fix seven points of concern, including the powers of the proposed environment protection agency; a requirement for large projects to disclose projected emissions upfront; and financial penalties.If Labor agrees to the conditions and makes a deal sometime around next Wednesday night, the bill would pass in time for a victory lap from the prime minister and his problem-solving minister. Albanese already has a list of post-election achievements ready for touting.For Ley, such a deal could reassert her authority over the divided Coalition joint party room and put outspoken Nationals – including Matt Canavan and Barnaby Joyce – in their place. Despite the opposition adopting his anti-net zero plan holus-bolus, Joyce is widely expected to defect to hard-right minor party One Nation, while Canavan has goaded Labor to make a deal with the Greens and suffer the political consequences.Liberal sources told Guardian Australia some Coalition conservatives are more open to a compromise on EPBC reform, in part to avoid further distancing the party from their traditional allies in corporate Australia who support more ambitious policies like net zero.Many business figures agree with authoritative former Treasury boss Ken Henry that EPBC reform is badly overdue and represents an opportunity to boost productivity in the economy.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Leader Larissa Waters said on Friday the government’s expedited timeline was suspicious, insisting meaningful reform need not be rushed.The minor party’s demands include an end to native forest logging and measures to consider the climate impact of projects as part of approvals. But sitting out a deal could marginalise the Greens and give Labor fresh ammunition to argue that the party of the environment has sought to stand in the way of environmental protections.Ley faces a choppy final sitting week, even if, as expected, her rumoured leadership rivals Angus Taylor and Andrew Hastie hold off launching any challenge until sometime in 2026.Monday’s Newspoll in The Australian will set atmospherics for the week, the same day columnist and author Niki Savva releases her latest book, Earthquake,about the former opposition leader Peter Dutton’s crushing loss at the May election.Savva has a habit of making trouble for the Liberals, and Albanese is among her biggest fans. Copies of the book were spotted around Parliament House on Friday. Another Dutton critic, the former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull, will be on the scene next week as well, part of an event on national security planned with the teal independent Monique Ryan in Melbourne.Ley has blitzed TV and radio since the net zero decision, delivering a major speech on defence, in which she pledged to improve the country’s energy sovereignty, to boost intelligence ties and provide protection ahead of the arrival of Aukus nuclear submarines.She also moved to take control of internal debate about immigration policy, deploying shadow ministers Jonathon Duniam and Paul Scarr to unite the party and avoid another high-stakes party room debate.The opposition leader even had some clear air from her rivals in recent days, with Hastie keeping a low profile and Taylor travelling to Washington DC. On Friday though, Taylor turned heads witha slick social media postthat looked a lot like a pitch for the leadership. He posted a Daily Telegraph video of him talking about aspiration, small business and Australians wanting to “stand in front of a single flag”.It’s rare that a single political issue emerges as a test for leaders of Labor, the Greens and the Coalition all at the same time. If EPBC reforms go through on the government’s timeline, a long overdue political milestone will have been reached.Just whose standing is improved, and whose is weakened, will cap an amazing year in politics.Tom McIlroy is Guardian Australia’s political editorExplore more on these topicsLiberal partyAnthony AlbaneseSussan LeyAustralian politicsAustralian GreensanalysisShareReuse this content"

They are just as versatile in the kitchen, and uniquely Australian.Australian or New Zealand-farmed king salmon were also good alternatives to Atlantic salmon, according to the guide. For those wanting to try something different, New South Wales caught dusky flathead was a new addition to the guide’s green list.Farmed Australian oysters and mussels remained a good choice, Meder said.“They’re absolutely delicious and they’re farmed with remarkably low impact on the natural environment – an absolute Christmas classic from both a culinary and an environmental perspective.”Christmas was a good opportunity to support seafood producers in South Australia, an industry that hadsuffereddue to the algal bloom. Meder said the state had a strong track record of monitoring the health of its seafood and the conditions of its marine environment, with a number of SA fisheries green-listed in the guide.“If you can find South Australian seafood on your shelves, you can have a really high confidence that it’s safe to eat,” he said.Sydney Fish Market’s existing Pyrmont site will remain open for a final Christmas seafood marathon, before moving to a brand new building in January. Shoppers were expected to turn out in record numbers for one “last hurrah” as retailers opened their doors for 36-hours straight, chief executive, Daniel Jarosch, said.“We will celebrate one final Christmas in our current home, before we open the doors to Sydney’s newest waterfront icon,” he said.Last year the market traded about 350 tonnes of seafood over the Christmas period, with 120t of prawns and 70,000 dozen oysters among the top sellers.Meder’s advice for anyone planning their festive feast was to “go straight to our GoodFish guide”. The guide rated the sustainability of 90% of seafood available in Australia, and suggested better alternatives when something came up as unsustainable.“Better yet, we’ll give you some advice on how to prepare it for friends and family as well to make sure Christmas is a special time and a sustainable time.”Explore more on these topicsSeafoodAustralian climate and environment in focusFoodMarine lifenewsShareReuse this content"

Guardian Australia has been told the charge relates to the prime minister, Anthony Albanese.Joel Davis, a 30-year-old from the Sydney suburb of Bondi, was arrested by theAustralian federal policeon Thursday after he was accused of sending a “menacing message” about Spender. The AFP said the message allegedly encouraged people to direct “abusive and hateful messages” at the politician after she condemned a protest by neo-Nazi group National Socialist Network earlier this month.Stefan Eracleous, 32, was charged on Friday with using a carriage service to harass Thorpe after his electronic devices were seized. He is also accused of defacing an Indigenous flag outside her office.The third man, a 29-year-old from Tamworth, was charged on Friday with seven offences that included four counts of using a carriage service to harass an “Australian high office holder”.Davis refused bailOn Friday, Davis appeared on camera from custody before theNew South Walesbail division before Magistrate Daniel Covington. He was refused bail and will remain in custody due to risks he could commit a “serious offence”.He allegedly wrote messages that encouraged abusive and hateful messages to be directed towards Spender, the MP for Wentworth, aftershe condemneda neo-Nazi rally held outside the NSW parliament earlier this month.The police-authorised rally was attended by about 60 black-clad men who held up a sign that said “Abolish the Jewish lobby” and chanted a Hitler Youth slogan.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailCovington said due to suggestions of the “ideology” that Davis follows, it would be “difficult for me on balance to think he wouldn’t continue to commit a serious offence if bail was granted today”.He noted Davis did not have a violent history and only an unrelated offence in NSW in 2014.The Legal Aid lawyer Liam McKibbin had argued that Davis should be granted bail because his partner was nine months pregnant with their son and had been due on Thursday.He also argued Davis was unlikely to face the maximum penalty for the one charge he was facing of using a carriage service to menace, harass or cause offence, and which carries a maximum penalty of five years in prison.“[The] allegation does not include a physical threat of violence, notwithstanding the alleged disturbing conduct,” McKibbin told the court.Covington later noted the message included threats to Spender that included sexual violence.The prosecutor Kristen Wakefield said Davis should not get bail. She told the court that Davis was already on bail for an alleged offence committed in South Australia and there was a risk he would not appear for future court dates if he was bailed again.She said the “victim expressed concern for the safety of her family and herself”.Wakefield said that “there was a comment directed at a wider audience which elevated the seriousness of this offence” and alleged that he was “encouraging a wider audience to engage in the violence against the victim”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He moved to Sydney three months ago to be with his pregnant partner.Davis was due to appear before court again in December.Eracleous to face court next weekThe three men were charged under the AFP’s national security investigation team, which was set up to “target groups and individuals causing high levels of harm to Australia’s social cohesion, including the targeting of federal parliamentarians”.Eracleous, who is based in Melbourne, will face court next Thursday.Thorpe’s office had reported to the AFP after a man allegedly sent multiple harassing emails before escalating to an abusive phone call, which included hateful and menacing rhetoric.Meanwhile, the Tamworth man will face a number of charges when he appears in court in January, including four counts of using a carriage service to harass, one count of unauthorised possession of a prohibited firearm, one count of not safely keeping a firearm and one count of possessing ammunition without a licence or permit.On Saturday, the AFP searched a Tamworth home, where they seized a rifle and ammunition.Explore more on these topicsFar rightAustralian federal policeAustralian politicsAllegra SpenderLidia ThorpeSydneyNew South WalesnewsShareReuse this content"

It could keep its national dignity or risk losing a major partner in the shape of a US administration apparently determined to end the conflict on Moscow’s brutal terms.“Now the pressure on Ukraine is one of the heaviest,” he said. Its options included agreeing to Trump’s 28-point proposal or “an extremely difficult winter”, which has already seen Russia destroy much of the country’senergy infrastructure, with millions of people left without heating and in the dark.Agreeing to the US-Russian plan could leaveUkraine“without freedom, dignity and justice”, he said. It would also mean believing “someone who has already attacked us twice”, he said, adding that he would never sacrifice Ukraine’s interests or go against its constitution. “We did not betray Ukraine then [in 2022], and we will not do so now,” he declared.Speaking on Fox radio, Trump said he thought Thursday was an “appropriate time” for Zelenskyy to sign the deal, and said he believed Ukraine could not prevent Russia’s army from taking the Donbas territories by force.The US president is pursuing an “aggressive timeline” to end the conflict, US officials indicated, and intends to heap unprecedented pressure on Kyiv.Trump is also threatening to cut vital intelligence sharing and weapons supplies for Ukraine if it fails to agree, reports suggest.AUS official, when asked whether the US could cut off intelligence sharing or logistical support if Kyiv did not sign the deal, said: “It was strongly implied to the Ukrainians that the United States expects them to agree to a peace deal. Any changes will be decided upon by the president himself.”On Friday, European leaders pushed back on the proposal, which Ukrainian politicians say is “absurd”.Speaking at the White House later on Friday, Trump repeated that he had expected to resolve the war much sooner given his good relationship with the Russian president,Vladimir Putin, adding, “It does take two to tango.”Referring to Zelenskyy, Trump said: “He’ll have to like it, and if he doesn’t like it, then you know, they should just keep fighting … at some point he’s going to have to accept something.”Trump may yet impose a Ukraine deal – but it threatens to be a disaster for KyivRead moreThe 28-point plan envisages Ukraine giving up the eastern Donbas region – including areas it currently controls – and shrinking the size of its army. It rules out the deployment of European peacekeepers and says Kyiv must relinquish long-range weapons and not join Nato.On Friday, Zelenskyy spoke by telephone with the US vice-president, JD Vance, who has previously pressured Ukraine to make a deal with Russia to end the war as quickly as possible.Following the hour-long call, Zelenskyy gave a cautious statement that the two sides had “managed to cover a lot of details of the American side’s proposals for ending the war, and we’re working to make the path forward dignified and truly effective for achieving a lasting peace”.Both countries appointed their national security advisers to continue negotiations on the text of the draft peace plan.Western allies including France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, Germany’s chancellor, Friedrich Merz, and Britain’sKeir Starmerspoke to Zelenskyy on Friday in a show of solidarity. They reaffirmed their support for Kyiv and said any agreement to end the conflict had to be genuinely fair and take into account Ukraine’s own red lines.In contrast to the Trump proposal, which calls for Ukraine to abandon several major cities, they said the existing line of contact should be the “starting point” for territorial discussions. The text also had to take into account the long-term interests of Europe and Ukraine, they stressed.The British prime minister urged a “just and lasting peace”. He said: “That’s what the president of America wants. That’s what we all want, and so we need to work from where we are to that end. But the principle that Ukraine must determine its future under its sovereignty is a fundamental principle.”Starmer is set to meet Ukraine’s allies at the Johannesburg G20 summit on Saturday to seek to “strengthen” a US-drafted plan.G7 leaders plus others from the G20 will discuss the deal on the sidelines ofthe South African meeting shunned by Donald Trump.The EU’s foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, warned that a peace deal that rewarded invasion would set a “very dangerous” global precedent.“If you just give in to the aggression, then you invite more aggression,” she said, adding that countries other than Russia could develop “an appetite” for neighbouring territory.In his address, Zelenskyy paid tribute to Ukrainians who had bravely endured “almost four years of full-scale invasion”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We are, of course, strong, but even the strongest metal can break. Don’t forget that,” he declared.Zelenskyy said he would work calmly and constructively with Washington over its plan, “offering alternatives”. It was drafted by Kirill Dmitriev, Vladimir Putin’s envoy, and Steve Witkoff, Trump’s special representative, during a meeting in Miami. Europe and Ukraine were excluded from discussions.Volodymyr Zelenskyy: why should I be afraid of Donald Trump?Read moreUkraine’s president said he was working to ensure “national interests” were respected. “Now practically every hour there are meetings, phone calls and work on issues that could change a lot,” he wrote on Telegram.He said his country welcomed US diplomatic efforts but wanted “real peace that would not be broken by a third [Russian] invasion”.Ukrainian government insiders believe that relations between Kyiv and Washington have improved dramatically since February, when Trump and Vance berated Zelenskyy and tossed him out of the Oval Office. Kyiv faces the unappealing prospect of provoking Trump’s wrath once again if it fails to swiftly accept his Moscow-drafted deal.In the immediate aftermath of the White House row, Trump briefly suspended intelligence sharing with Kyiv, cutting off a crucial channel of battlefield information for Ukraine’s frontline units.The US has stopped supplying Ukraine with direct military aid, but still provides advanced weapons systems to Kyiv under the UN’sprioritised Ukraine requirements list(Purl) initiative, in which European partners pay for them.A delegation of senior US military officials led by the army secretary, Dan Driscoll, held talks with Zelenskyy on Thursday in Kyiv. Trump has named Driscoll – Vance’s friend and former classmate – as his newest “special representative”. The group of American generals was likely to fly to Moscow at the end of next week to discuss the “peace plan” with the Kremlin, US sources said.Putin confirmed on Friday that Moscow had recieved a copy of the US plan, which he said could “lay the foundation” for an end to the war. “I believe that it could lay the foundation for a final peace settlement,” hesaid.A person close to the Kremlin said that while Putin “liked” the overall contours of the peace proposal, it fell short of other Kremlin demands. These include a legally binding guarantee that Nato will not expand further east, as well as enshrining Ukraine’s neutral status in its constitution.As for potential EU membership, the source said Moscow would only consider it if it excluded a military component, citing Austria’s model of neutrality as an example.US officials have said the text was hammered out after consultations with Rustem Umerov, Ukraine’s national security and defence council secretary, and a close Zelenskyy ally. Umerov – a former defence minister – made several modifications, they added. He denied this, saying Kyiv would not accept terms that violated its sovereignty.The reaction from Ukrainian civil society has been overwhelmingly negative. People have variously dismissed the plan as one-sided and tantamount to Ukraine’s abject surrender. It comes as Zelenskyy is under immense pressure at home after acorruption scandalinvolving his former business partner and at least two of his ministers.The plan also failed to win over senior European commentators. Constanze Stelzenmüller of the Brookings Institute described its drafting as “appalling” and said its substance was “outrageous”.If enacted, it would lead to Russia becoming the “apex predator in Europe”, she observed. “Truly marks the complete enshittification of diplomacy,” she added on X.Reform UK leader Nigel Farage, an ally of the US president, expressed opposition to the Trump administration plan.“Ukraine being asked to halve the size of its army is unacceptable. I am waiting to see a counter-proposal from Zelensky’s government,” he posted on X.Explore more on these topicsUkraineVolodymyr ZelenskyyEuropeDonald TrumpRussiaVladimir PutinEuropean UnionnewsShareReuse this content"

In modern times, it is no surprise that the parties Gill represented were Ukip, the Brexit party, and brieflyReform UK.When seeking a sympathetic vessel for pro-Russia views, the nationalist, anti-EU and anti-migrant parties of Europe have been obvious targets for Vladimir Putin’s Russia – which have a shared hostility towards the European bloc.Farage, who led Ukip, theBrexitparty and now Reform, and was a longstanding associate of Gill, has claimed the former MEP was a “bad apple” who betrayed his party and country.But Farage’s ownpublicly expressed views on Russiaand Putin appear to have created an environment in which those more sympathetic than most to Moscow have been drawn to his parties.The court case shows that while Gill was the only MEP found to have taken payments for making pro-Russia statements, some of his colleagues had been making similar points in favour of Moscow’s narrative on the war in Ukraine without reward.Farage himself, who has not been under scrutiny as part of the investigation or played in role in assisting it, has spoken of his admiration for Putin as a political operator and repeatedly warned the west against “poking the Russian bear with a stick”, in recent years accusing it of provoking the war in Ukraine.Back in 2014,he cited Putin as the politician he most admired, “as an operator but not as a human being”. Asked whether he regretted making the comments at the time, Farage told a Chatham House audience: “I said I don’t like him, I wouldn’t trust him and I wouldn’t want to live in his country, but compared with the kids who run foreign policy in this country, I’ve more respect for him than our lot.”He also made at least 17 appearances on state-owned Russia Today between 2010 and 2014, on which he made no criticisms of Russian democracy and claimedEuropewas governed not by elected democracies but instead “by the worst people we have seen in Europe since 1945”.Cryptocurrency backed by Farage donor is used for Russian war effort, investigators sayRead moreThe issue of Russia is also felt by some Reform insiders to have harmed the party in last year’s election, when Farage repeated his views since the 1990s that “the ever-eastward expansion” of the Nato military alliance and the EU was giving Putin “a reason to [give to] his Russian people to say ‘they’re coming for us again’ and to go to war”. He added: “We provoked this war. Of course, it’s his fault.”Reform UK as a party now appears to sense there is some political danger in appearing too generous towards Russia, given it is ahead in the polls and public opinion in the UK is firmly pro-Ukraine and anti-Moscow. The party said on Friday that Gill had acted in a “reprehensible, treasonous and unforgivable” way.However, Farage’s own views on Russia and Ukraine are likely to be further tested – particularly on whether he still believes the west provoked the war.Labour, no doubt, scents the possibility of undermining Reform UK’s poll lead by calling on Farage to root out pro-Russia views within his party and to disavow “Putin talking points” such as the idea that the west and Ukraine provoked Putin’s invasion.Farage is not a politician known for letting go of long-held positions, even when it is politically expedient. But it would be good politics by Reform to take their rival party’s advice.Explore more on these topicsReform UKRussiaVladimir PutinNigel FarageUkraineEuropeLabouranalysisShareReuse this content"

Rinse and repeat.This time it feels a bit different, however. Reports on Friday suggested the US has threatened that ifUkrainedoes not sign a hastily concocted peace plan, Washington could withdraw intelligence-sharing and other support critical to the Ukrainian war effort.Zelenskyyaddressed the nation, saying Ukraine was faced with a choice of “losing our dignity or the risk of losing our key partner”. He spoke of an extremely difficult week ahead, and of unbearable pressure being put on Kyiv.1:50Zelenskyy warns of 'most difficult moment in history' amid pressure to accept US plan – videoThe timing is particularly bad for Ukraine: the war’s fourth winter is shaping up to be its most difficult, as the country faces an acute power shortage after Russian attacks on infrastructure. Morale is flagging, people are exhausted and Zelenskyy’s inner circle isembroiled in a huge corruption scandal.Trump, for his part, is in a hurry, reportedly keen to get a deal done before Thanksgiving next Thursday, and perhaps with one eye on the“Fifa peace prize”, apparently created solely as a gift to his ego, which he is expected to be given at the World Cup draw in Washington DC on 5 December.That timeline seems like wishful thinking in the extreme, and as with any plan emerging from the Trump administration, there are more unknowns than knowns. Has Trump himself signed off on it? Has Putin? Is the plan meant to be a starting point for discussion or a final document? Did Rustem Umerov, secretary of Ukraine’s security council, agree to some or all of it during recent discussions with the US envoy Steve Witkoff in Florida? Is the plan that surfaced in the media even the “real plan”, or merely a draft leaked bythe Russian sideto get ahead of the game?What do we know about the reported US-Russian plan to end the Ukraine war?Read moreThese are just a few of the many questions being asked by European leaders as they scramble to get to grips with anotherTrump administrationmove that has left them blindsided.The odds seem stacked against this initiative bearing any lasting fruit, but ruling out entirely that Trump’s aggressive diplomacy could lead to some kind of deal would be premature. It could be a disastrous deal for Ukraine, however. Zelenskyy’s solemn bearing on Friday afternoon shows how worried he is about what is being put in front of him.For all the public bravado, there has been a private admission in some parts of the Ukrainian elite that a deal may need to be done sooner rather than later, even if everyone sees Moscow as a bad-faith negotiating partner.1:08Ukraine is 'geared up for clear and honest work', says Zelenskyy after US peace plan – videoSome European intelligence services have also come to the conclusion that the military, social and economic conditions may compel Ukraine to sign a deal at some point soon. “Ukraine may need to make some very unpleasant compromises, including giving up territory, and it may happen in the next six months,” said one European intelligence official earlier this autumn.But the plan as it stands seems far too outlandish for Zelenskyy to sell to his population. It would involve Ukraine withdrawing from some territory it still controls, agreeing to an amnesty for all Russian war crimes, and relying on vaguely defined US security guarantees – for which the US would apparently charge – to prevent another Russian incursion in a few weeks, months or years.“This kind of proposal is not even worth the paper it’s written on,” said another European intelligence official, from a different country, referring to the plan’s assertion that Russia would not be expected to launch further military action.Post-deal security guarantees have always been the key sticking point for any lasting peace, and if they rely on vague Trump-backed promises or Russian expressions of goodwill, few in Ukraine or Europe more widely will be convinced.“What we see from the Russian side is that they have a strong feeling that they can influence the US administration in a way that is beneficial to them … but while such plans can be drawn up and discussed without Ukraine and Europe, I don’t think they can be signed or implemented without Europe,” the official said.Explore more on these topicsUkraineVolodymyr ZelenskyyUS foreign policyEuropeRussiaDonald TrumpTrump administrationanalysisShareReuse this content"

The noise is alas constant. But, just like the desert, inner life is fortified in prison.”At his release request hearing, Sarkozy had appeared by video link from a room in prison, describing his time inside as gruelling. He had told the court: “I want to pay tribute to all the prison staff, who are exceptionally humane, and who have made this nightmare bearable – because it is a nightmare.“I never imagined that at 70 years of age, I’d be in prison. It’s an ordeal that has been imposed on me. I confess it’s hard, it’s very hard. It leaves a mark on any prisoner because it’s gruelling.”Sarkozy, who served as France’s president between 2007 and 2012, was the first former head of an EU country and the first postwar leader ofFranceto serve time in prison.Before entering jail he had said he would use his time to write a book.It is not certain whether he had time to read and critique the three books he took into prison with him: a two-volume biography of Jesus and Alexandre Dumas’s novel The Count of Monte Cristo, in which an innocent man is sentenced to jail but escapes to take revenge.Sarkozy was held in solitary confinement for his own security in a cell of about nine sq metres (100 sq ft) with his own shower and toilet at La Santé prison in Paris. Two bodyguards occupied a neighbouring cell. The French news weekly Le Point reported that he had eaten only yoghurts in prison because he feared any food might have been spat on. He had facilities to cook for himself but refused this, the magazine reported, citing unnamed sources. It is uncertain whether Sarkozy will write about what he ate in prison.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

During the war, Hall said she was consistently able to send about $5,000 a week to people inGaza. For the month of October, she said she raised just over $2,000 across all of her campaigns.“The drop in donations is catastrophic. It feels like with the so-called ‘ceasefire’ the world thinks Palestinians don’t need our help any more,” Hall said.“Mutual aid has kept people alive for two years. And now going into winter, and having been displaced so many times, many don’t even have winter clothing or blankets.”Four other mutual aid fund organisers told the Guardianthey had also seen sharp drops in the money coming in across their campaigns in the past month.Unlike mainstream or grassroots humanitarian organisations with large state and private donor bases, mutual aid funds rely on small donations, with volunteers using social media to raise visibility of Palestinians – who, when internet access and battery power permit, have also been using social media accounts to encourage donations.View image in fullscreenMegan Hall, who is based in Australia, runs 95 mutual aid funds for individual families.Photograph: megan.palestine/InstagramSome nonprofit organisations are also observing a dramatic shift downwards in support.Gaza Soup Kitchenhas raised more than $5.8m on GoFundMe since February 2024, serving 10,000 meals daily to people living in Gaza. From September to October, it saw donations drop by 51%.Hani Almadhoun, the charity’s co-founder, said: “It has virtually no impact now, or the next 30 or 60 days; we are not changing our plans. But long term, maybe. As of now we press on, no changes, but our minds are on the future.”According to an assessment bySARI Global, cited by the World Health Organization, more than 70% of Gaza’s population, nearly 1.9 million people, are confined to parts of the territory that are exposed to rain, strong winds and coastal surges with no functioning infrastructure.“Most of the agricultural land has been destroyed, most of the livestock has been destroyed and the healthcare system is decimated. And of course, the fact that people have been displaced over and over again over these two years means that their coping mechanisms have been degraded to nothing,” said a spokesperson for the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA).“The ceasefire means that it is quieter in terms of bombs falling on people’s heads. It doesn’t mean that overnight people’s lives became wonderful because most of Gaza is completely destroyed.”Larger, mainstream humanitarian organisations are also concerned at the drop-offs in donations since the ceasefire.OxfamGB is reporting a decline and Save the Children UK said donations coming in from its social media marketing had gone down by a third.“We market but when there’s not enough media coverage, the marketing doesn’t become cost effective, and so it is like a self-perpetuating cycle,” said Alison Griffin of Save the Children UK. She said other revenue streams – from high-income and legacy donors – were holding up but stressed that the need in Gaza was high.View image in fullscreenChildren play among the rubble in northern Gaza. Some families are sheltering in bombed-out buildings but still paying rent.Photograph: Mahmoud Issa/ReutersSome aid convoys have been allowed into Gaza byIsraelsince the ceasefire. Israel has opened only three of the seven border crossings, which OCHA said had limited aid distribution.“Around 2,000 tonnes of food assistance should be entering on a daily basis,” said the spokesperson. “If we’re looking at the amount that is entering through the UN-coordinated mechanism, it is around 60% of that target.”For individuals and families in Gaza reliant on mutual aid funds, life was very difficult, said Ahmed al-Deeb, 28, from Gaza City. He has depended entirely on a mutual aid fund to feed and house his extended family of 14, including his sick two-year-old niece, since Hall established it six months ago.To date, the fund has raised about $6,500 for the family. From May to September, donations grew every month to nearly $3,000 for September. However, in October, donations dropped back to about $300. In November, just slightly more than $150 has been raised so far.Deeb’s family was displaced to Deir al-Balah in central Gaza after Israel’s ground invasion of Gaza City in September. For a tent on a plot of land with 10 other families, he paid a landlord the equivalent of $300 a month. In October, he was only able to pay the rent by borrowing money from a friend.Worried about living in a tent during winter, he decided to take his family back to Gaza City to search for a bomb-damaged apartment to live in. He has found one but still has to find $400 a month – money he does not have.“I cannot even start describing to you how bad it is,” he said. “If I don’t pay, the landlord will evict me.”View image in fullscreenA displaced Palestinian, Hanan al-Joujou, sits with her child at the entrance of their tent in Nuseirat camp.Photograph: Mahmoud Issa/ReutersDeeb said more food was becoming available in markets and prices had decreased. His family largely survives on lentils and pasta. Humanitarian aid is hard to find and he has not been able to access any for eight months.Other Palestinians in Gaza told the Guardian of similar struggles, all pointing to a decline in donations.‘Will my baby be born in a tent? Will it have food?’: what it’s like to be pregnant in GazaRead moreFundraisers suspect the decline is largely due to public belief that Palestinian suffering has ended. But Hall said other factors were at play. She said that after two years of donating, and the high costs of evacuating people from Gaza City in September, she and other small donors and activists were running out of money. Hall has been selling her furniture to be able to raise the money to pay one family’s rent.Others pointed to financial strain on ordinary people. In the US, the government shutdown stopped salaries for many public employees and affected social security benefits, while people in the UK and other countries are facing a cost-of-living crisis.Leading social-media companies such as Meta had algorithmic biases against pro-Palestinian content that made it difficult for fundraisers to be seen outside existing advocacy circles, according to the chief executive ofTech for Palestine, Paul Biggar.For the 2 million people in Gaza, another uncertain winter has arrived. Deeb said his first rent payment was due soon and if he was evicted, he and his family would have to sleep on the streets.Explore more on these topicsGlobal developmentGazaPalestineMiddle East and north AfricaIsraelCharitable givingCharitiesnewsShareReuse this content"

Case said that while he was not allowed to give advice during pre-budget access talks, he believed the same.“In Whitehall we were very worried about the promises they made before the election on not raising taxes because we obviously knew the true state of the public finances that would face them on arrival,” said Case, who left the role last December and is now a cross-bench peer.View image in fullscreenSimon Case is now a cross-bench peerPhotograph: Simon Dawson/ReutersIf Wednesday’s budget fails to get to grips with ingrained problems connected to tax, spending and debt, voters might abandon centrist parties for the likes of Reform UK, Case indicated.“Yes, this budget is going to be critical to the fortunes ofKeir Starmerand Rachel Reeves, which are intertwined,” he said. “But this budget is even higher stakes than that, because it raises the question of whether centre-ground governments can answer the fundamental questions that are hampering the UK. And if they can’t, voters will look elsewhere. It’s a really pivotal moment.”The arguments about whether particular tax rises may or may not break a manifesto pledge were, to an extent, missing the wider point, Case argued.“We talk about a few billion here or there that’s going to be enormously politically significant, because it’s the difference between breaking the manifesto rather than accepting the fact the process is unsustainable,” he said.“Nobody is having the really big conversation: if we’re going to dramatically change the UK economy we need to be talking about how we spend hundreds of billions.”Reeves’s woes are deep-rooted, he said: “Some of this is to do with the current political situation, of course. But there are other long-running issues that just feel like they’re getting harder and harder.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

There’s also great pressure to spend on public services because they’re not performing as we’d like. Every budget now for the next few years is going to be incredibly difficult.”One confirmed measure in the budget is a renewed crackdown on illegal vapes, involving new powers for border and tax officials to clamp down on the products, as well as QR codes for legal ones to make it easier to spot fakes.The move comes five months after the government passed a ban on single-use vapes in an attempt to reduce environmental damage and stop their widespread use among children. Since the ban was passed, however, the government has struggled to limit the proliferation of illegal products.Officials said Reeves would use her budget to unveil a series of new tools to fight the illegal vape trade. They include giving Border Force and HM Revenue and Customs the power to seize illegal vapes on the spot and fine rogue traders up to £10,000 for breaking the law.A government source said: “Britain’s high streets are being flooded with illegal vapes by rogue traders. The chancellor will crack down hard – giving Border Force and HMRC the power to seize dodgy vapes on the spot and hit offenders with £10,000 fines.

We will get justice for the survivors.”Democrats on the investigative committee appear to have few options to compel Mountbatten-Windsor to talk. As the minority party, they lack the power to issue subpoenas, and the Republican chair James Comer has not commented on if he would take such a step against the former prince.Even if one was issued, Mountbatten-Windsor – who has strongly denied wrongdoing – could avoid the legal penalties for non-compliance by not coming to the United States.The lawmakers issued their statement days after Donald Trump had signed into law the Epstein Files Transparency Act, which will compel attorney general Pam Bondi to release documents related to the government’s handling of his case within 30 days.Trump, a one-time friend of Epstein, tried to stop the bill from moving through Congress, but backed down when it appeared clear ithad the votesto pass the House of Representatives. However, the law includes exemptions for the release of documents that could undermine national security and jeopardize investigations.Critics have accused Bondi of being a Trump loyalist who has used the law enforcement agency’s powers to protect the president and retaliate against his allies. Last week, she announced that she wouldinvestigate tiesbetween Epstein and Democrats, shortly after Trump demanded she do so.In a letter to Bondi on Friday, Garcia wrote that “politically motivated investigations are not a legitimate justification for withholding or redacting records” under the newly passed law.“There is already a concern president Trump will attempt, on dubious legal grounds, to exploit a provision which allows [the] DoJ to withhold information relevant to ongoing investigations,” Garcia said, echoinga concernexpressed by Republican senators this week.He also noted that the committee is awaiting the justice department’s response to a subpoena they issued in August for documents related to Epstein, which Garcia said can be shared in their entirety with lawmakers, even if they are involved in an investigation.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst ThingFree daily newsletterOur US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

These include interview transcripts, court documents and emails, as well as records from the investigation that led to Epstein’s 2008 guilty plea to sexual abuse charges in Florida, and the sex trafficking investigation that led to his 2019 arrest in New York, sources said.As he campaigned to return to the White House last year, Trump, alongside his allies, made statements indicating that there was more to be revealed about Epstein and his ties to global elites.But in July, the justice department and FBI released a memo saying that they had no further information to share about his activities or relationships, while concluding that his death was a suicide, despite conspiracy theories to the contrary.The announcement sparked an uproar among Trump’s supporters, leading to a drawn out congressional campaign to force release of government files related to the case that culminated in this week’s passage of the Epstein Files Transparency Act.Explore more on these topicsJeffrey EpsteinUS politicsAndrew Mountbatten-WindsornewsShareReuse this content"

Prescott left that role in the summer.Banerji cited what he called “governance issues” at the top of the corporation. In a letter seen by BBC News, he said he had not been consulted about the events leading up to the departures of Davie and Turness.It will be seen as a criticism of the BBC’s chair, Samir Shah, and follows anger inside the corporation over the handling of Prescott’s memo, which made complaints of systemic bias in coverage ofDonald Trump, Gaza and transgender rights.Some even considered the pressure over the Prescott claims to be part of “a coup” by the political right to influence the BBC’s reporting. Shah has dismissed such claims as fanciful.Banerji’s resignation, however, will focus more attention on the role of Robbie Gibb, the BBC board member who has faced accusations of repeatedly raising issues of liberal bias within the organisation.Sir Gibb was previously Theresa May’s communications chief and has described himself as a “proper Thatcherite Conservative”. Boris Johnson placed him on the BBC board and the last Conservative government gave him a new term shortly before the general election.Banerji’s departure is significant because he was often seen as a counterweight to complaints from Gibb and others of bias. His departure means the BBC is even more depleted as it heads into the process of finding a new director general.Some BBC insiders have pointed to an alignment between Gibb’s concerns and those of Prescott. It had been reported that the pair were friends, but the Guardian has since established that Gibb was on a panel that handed Prescott his advisory role. Prescott has said his concerns “do not come with any political agenda”.The board-level resignation comes as the two men prepare to appear before MPs on Monday as the Commons culture, media and sport committee attempts to learn more about the events that led to Davie’s resignation.Prescott’s memo was handed to the BBC board weeks ago and was leaked to the Daily Telegraph, which reported its contents over several days.It included concerns about anedit of a Donald Trump speech on Panorama. The US president has since threatened to sue, potentially for billions. Shah, however, has also said Prescott’s memo was a partial and personal account of BBC discussions and did not reflect a full picture.MPs, BBC staff members and Bectu, the main BBC union, have called for Gibb to be removed from the BBC board over allegations of political interference.Friends of Gibb have said he is a defender of the BBC and acts out of genuine concern for its impartiality. The broadcaster has said he is only one of many voices on the BBC’s board.A BBC spokesperson said: “Shumeet Banerji today notified the BBC board of his resignation. Mr Banerji’s term on the board as a non-executive director was due to end at the end of December and we thank him for his service.“The search for a replacement is already well under way and we will update further in due course.”Explore more on these topicsBBCnewsShareReuse this content"

However, I am confident that my colleagues and I have acted professionally, patiently, and in good faith throughout.”Your Party has faced a series of splits and disagreements in its short history, mainly pitting Sultana, who was elected as a Labour MP but now sits as an independent, against Corbyn, the former Labour leader, and four other independents who were allied with the group.Last week, Mohamed and Hussain, plus the two other independent MPs and Corbyn, signed a Your Party statement accusing Sultana ofunnecessary delay in passing on £850,000 in donations, a move that infuriated Sultana.Allies of Sultana accused other MPs in Your Party of trying to undermine her with the statement, saying the timing, just before Sultana appeared on BBC One’s Question Time, seemed intended to hamper her chances of winning a possible leadership contest against Corbyn.In response, Your Party sources said Sultana was creating unnecessary barriers in arguing that there were legal reasons why she could not immediately transfer all the money. More of the money has since been transferred, and that row appears to have calmed.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I will say there’s no difference in party. There’s no difference in anything, and we’re going to be helping him to make everybody’s dream come true, having a strong and very safeNew York.”The president congratulated Mamdani on his mayoral victory, describing it as “an incredible race against smart people” – and the two politicians shook hands.Trump added that he had already seen signs the young politician might surprise both conservative and liberal observers alike.1:27'You think President Trump is a fascist?': Donald Trump meets Zohran Mamdani – videoFor Mamdani, the meeting represented vindication of his strategy to focus the discussion on economic issues rather than ideological divides. He described the meeting as “productive” and “focused on a place of shared admiration and love, which is New York City”.“We spoke about rent, we spoke about groceries, we spoke about utilities, we spoke about the different ways in which people are being pushed out,” Mamdani told reporters after emerging from the Oval Office.Trump added: “We had some interesting conversation, and some of his ideas really are the same ideas that I have.” He pointed to their agreement on lowering crime and building housing.The meeting marked the first face-to-face discussion between the combative Republican president and the defiant democratic socialist.For Mamdani, a leftwing state assemblymember until his shock primary victory, the sit-down presented an early test of his ability to negotiate with a president who controls vast federal resources that the city depends upon. Mamdani’s teammade the first movein reaching out for a meeting, all while Trump earlier threatened to withhold federal funding from New York if Mamdani took office, though he has since suggested a more conciliatory posture,telling Fox News: “I’m so torn, because I would like to see the new mayor do well, because I love New York.”The administration has deployed multiple pressure tactics ahead of the meeting. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials havesignaled plansto escalate operations in New York City, while a number of rightwing congressional Republicans suggested investigating whether Mamdani’s citizenship is valid, despite his naturalization in 2018 after immigrating from Uganda as a child.Mamdani’s team spent Thursday preparing for the encounter through calls with Kathy Hochul, New York’s governor, Chuck Schumer, the Senate minority leader, Hakeem Jeffries, the House minority leader, and the civil rights leader Al Sharpton to strategize the approach. He alsospoke withRobert Wolf, the former chief executive of UBS Americas and a known ally of Barack Obama.When asked on Thursday whether he feared receiving hostile treatment similar to the contentious Oval Office meeting between Trump and Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Ukraine’s president, earlier this year – where Trump accused Zelenskyy of “gambling with world war III” – Mamdani brushed aside concerns. “I’ll stand up for New Yorkers every single day,” he replied.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

His promises include free public buses, government-run grocery stores, rent freezes for more than 1m stabilized units, and the city’s first universal childcare program.“I view this meeting as an opportunity for me to make my case,” Mamdani said on Thursday. “It behooves me to ensure that I leave no stone unturned in looking to make this city more affordable.”Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, similarly said Trump’s willingness to meet was evidence of his openness to dialogue across political divides.“President Trump is willing to meet with anyone and talk to anyone and to try to do what’s right on behalf of the American people, whether they live in blue states or red states, or blue cities,” Leavitt said.But the underlying tensions were not subtle. Trump got directly involved in the mayoral election, dismissing the candidate from his own party, Curtis Sliwa, as a lightweight and instead endorsing Andrew Cuomo, the Independent, formerly Democratic governor, while branding Mamdani a “little communist”. TheTrump administrationalso yanked federal aid for critical infrastructure projects – including the Gateway Tunnel between New York and New Jersey and the Second Avenue subway line – during budget negotiations.Among New York voters, Trump garnered only 27% approval compared with 70% disapproval inCNN’s exit pollingfrom the mayoral election. However, 10% of Trump’s 2024 voters also cast ballots for Mamdani, suggesting there is indeed overlap in their populist economic messaging, despite their vast ideological differences.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpZohran MamdaniUS politicsNew YorkTrump administrationnewsShareReuse this content"

For the moment at least, the two New Yorkers appeared friendly, smiling and cautiously optimistic about the work they might accomplish together.Neither revived their hot campaign trail rhetoric, in which they cast each other as diametrically opposed political adversaries. Trump had labeled Mamdani a “100% Communist Lunatic” and urged voters to back his opponent, the former New York governor Andrew Cuomo. In turn, Mamdani had assailed Trump as a “despot” and pledged to be the president’s “worst nightmare”. Here are five things that stood out from their surprising display of political bonhomie.1.Trump and Mamdani <3 New YorkThe president likes a winner and he loves New York – and both were clear on Friday, when he extolled Mamdani for running an “incredible race” against some “very tough people”.“We have one thing in common – we want this city of ours that we love to do incredibly well,” Trump said, in his opening remarks to reporters following the meeting with Mamdani.Trump was especially impressed with Mamdani’s election performance, marveling at how the mayor-elect “came out of nowhere”. Trump also seemed flattered to learn that a share of his own supporters had backed the 34-year-old Democrat. “One in 10,” Mamdani interjected, recalling his discussion with Queens residents who voted for Trump in the 2024 election. To Trump’s delight, Mamdani noted that he had spoken with a pharmacist who counted the president’s late father, Fred, as a customer.Trump pledged to cooperate with the new mayor, saying: “The better he does, the happier I am.”2.Trump would live in Mamdani’s New YorkWhen it became clear Mamdani, an unabashed democratic socialist, was on track to be the city’s next mayor, conservatives began warning of an exodus of billionaires and bankers from the heart of global capitalism. (No such flight has yet beendocumented.)On Friday, the Queens-born billionaire, now officially a Florida resident, said he was not among them. Trump would “absolutely” live in the city under a Mayor Mamdani.“I always feel very, very comfortable being in New York,” Trump said. “And I think much more so after the meeting.”He added: “I think he’s going to surprise some conservative people, actually.”3.Trump dismisses Republican attacks on MamdaniAsked by a reporter whether he agrees with New York congresswoman Elise Stefanik, who has characterized Mamdani as a “jihadist”, Trump said he did not, and downplayed her comments as overheated campaign rhetoric in her quest to become the state’s next governor.“I met with a man who’s a very rational person,” Trump said.“I met with a man who really wants to see New York be great again.”4.Trump deflected pointed questions from conservative journalists to MamdaniMamdani faced several pointed questions from conservative and Trump-friendly journalists – but Trump swooped in on multiple occasions to deflect on the mayor-elect’s behalf.When asked if he would retract his attacks on the president as a “despot” and an “authoritarian”, Mamdani was prepared. He avoided answering the question directly, saying: “We are very clear about our positions and our views, and what I really appreciate about the president is the meeting that we had focused not on places of disagreement, which there are many, and also focused on the shared purpose that we have in serving New Yorkers.”But before the reporter could press Mamdani further, Trump interjected: “I’ve been called much worse than a despot and so it’s not that insulting.” He predicting Mamdani might change his mind after “we get to working together”.Fox News correspondent Jacqui Heinrich later followed up on the matter, asking whether Mamdani still considers Trump to be a “fascist”. Mamdani, cheeks flushed, began to respond, but Trump jumped in again. “That’s OK,” the president said, jovially tapping Mamdani’s arm and telling him it was “easier” to just say yes, which Mamdani did.1:27'You think President Trump is a fascist?': Donald Trump meets Zohran Mamdani – videoAt another point, the same reporter suggested Mamdani was a hypocrite for flying to Washington rather than taking the train from New York, which would have been the more environmentally-friendly transportation mode. “I’ll stick up for you,” Trump offered, arguing it was much faster to fly and that the mayor-elect is busy.5.Adversaries turned affordability agenda partnersMamdani’s election was just one victory in a banner night for Democrats, all of whom focused relentlessly on what they framed as a cost-of-living crisis in America. Since then, Trump has sought to re-focus his political message on affordability – and he spent much of Friday’s appearance with Mamdani insisting that lowering prices was one of their shared concerns.Mamdani – whose calls to “freeze the rent” and make city busses “fast and free” rallied New Yorkers behind his campaign – described Friday’s meeting with the president “productive” and said their discussion touched on the soaring cost of rent, groceries, and utilities.“It was a productive meeting focused on a place of shared admiration and love, which is New York City, and the need to deliver affordability to New Yorkers, the 8.5 million people who call our city their home, who are struggling to afford life in the most expensive city in the United States of America,” Mamdani said.Mamdani added that he was “looking forward” to working with the Trump administration “to deliver on that affordability agenda” – a markedly different tone from hiselection night address,when he told Trump to “turn the volume up” and listen as he pledged that New York would be a “light” in a “moment of political darkness”.Trump repeatedly committed to working with Mamdani. At one point, Trump suggested his administration would pressure the utility company ConEdison, the primary electric provider for millions of New Yorkers, to lower its rates. He also welcomed Mamdani’s desire to build more housing.“He wants to see a lot of houses created, a lot of apartments built, et cetera,” said Trump, the former Manhattan developer. “People would be shocked but I want to see the same thing.Trump added: “We agree on a lot more than I would have thought. I want him to do a great job, and we’ll help them do a great job.”Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpZohran MamdaniUS politicsNew YorknewsShareReuse this content"

Since the signing, the department of justice has 30 days to release the files.“Thanks to brave supporters in Congress and in the public, we have won one victory, the passage of the bill to release the Epstein files. But we know the battle is far from over,” said the statement signed by 18 named survivors and 10 Jane Does.The statement said the women were braced for attempts to blame the victims for their own or each other’s abuse, incomplete disclosures, efforts to pull the survivors apart and threats to their physical safety.“Many of us have already received death threats and other threats of harm. We are bracing for these to escalate. We ask every federal and state law enforcement agency that has jurisdiction over these threats to investigate them and protect us,” the statement said.A few women have opened up about the threats they have received in the wake of telling their stories.Anouska De Georgiou, who was the first British woman to allege she was sexually abused by Epstein, told the BBC’s Newsnight program this month that she had received threats that she believed were intended to silence her since waiving her anonymity in 2019.Virginia Giuffre, perhaps the best known Epstein survivor, had also reportedly suffered a campaign of intimidation and death threats before she killed herself in April.The statement signed by survivors including sisters Maria and Annie Farmer,Marina LacerdaandJess Michaels, also referenced recent attempts by some which appeared to downplay the abuse of Epstein and his accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell.Last week the conservative radio hostMegyn Kelly appeared to questionwhether Epstein really was a pedophile. “There’s a difference between a 15-year-old and a five-year-old,” she said on her podcast.“We are already hearing efforts to suggest that victims who had reached the age of 18 were not really victims anymore,” the women said in the statement.“We denounce this outrageous argument. Some of us were over 18 when we were victimized. Some were vulnerable because of childhood sexual abuse. Some were vulnerable because of poverty. Some of us were assaulted by Epstein and Maxwell and their accomplices using force, intimidation, and violence. All of us were vulnerable because of life circumstances our young selves faced that were manipulated by Epstein and Maxwell and for which we were targeted.”Explore more on these topicsJeffrey EpsteinUS CongressDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

Donald Trump, who for months denied inflation was still high, has in recent weekstaken several stepsto tackle concerns around affordability.Trump reverses course and cuts tariffs on US food importsRead moreFed officials, under pressure from persistent demands from Trump, are meanwhile weighing whether to cut interest rates. The central bank raised rates aggressively in 2022 and 2023 to combat inflation, and started cautiously cutting them late last year.Powell has made clear he planned to tread carefully in the absence of important information on the economy’s strength and direction. “We’re going to collect every scrap of data we can find, evaluate it and think carefully about it,” he said last month. “What do you do if you’re driving in the fog? You slow down.”That said, a speech by one Fed policymaker lifted expectations of another rate cut in December. John Williams, the president of theFederal ReserveBank of New York, said on Friday that he still saw “room for a further adjustment in the near term” to rates.a bar graphThe latest jobs report, for September,was a mixed bag, with 119,000 jobs added, but the unemployment rate ticked up to its highest level since 2021, and growth estimates for the preceding months were revised lower.The September jobs report was also disrupted by the shutdown, and released more than a month later. The complete October report will not be released at all, although data on the number of jobs created or lost in that month will be published alongside the full report for November – a week after the next Fed meeting.Explore more on these topicsInflationUS economyUS interest ratesJerome PowellFederal ReserveEconomicsnewsShareReuse this content"

You tried to get me fired in September. It didn’t work,”Kimmel said. “Mr President, I admire your tenacity.”In mid-September, Kimmel’s show was briefly suspended byABCunder pressure from two of the network’s biggest affiliate partners, Nexstar and Sinclair, not to mention Trump’s handpicked chair of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), Brendan Carr, over comments that Kimmel had made about the killing of the conservative activist Charlie Kirk a few days earlier.The comedian said his wife had broken the news to him when he woke up that day that Trump had again called for his firing. “I woke up this morning, I’m in bed, my wife comes out of the bathroom – she’s got her phone. She goes, ‘Um, Trump tweeted you should be fired again.’ I was like, ‘Oh,’ and then I went downstairs and made bagels for the kids.”Kimmel referred to Trump as a “snowflake”.“I have honestly lost count now of how many times the president has demanded I be pulled off the air,” he said. “Every five weeks, he flips out and wants me fired. If you got this many threats from a neighbor, you’d have no problem getting a restraining order. The judge would be like, ‘Yeah, sounds like the guy’s nuts.’ Boom. It’s disturbing.”Kimmel said he would be happy to leave his post if Trump was willing to resign as well: “Let’s ride off into the sunset together.”On his show, Kimmel highlighted an announcement this week from the FCC that said the agency would take public comments for a review of whether national broadcasters – such as ABC – have too much power over the local stations that cover him. Carr, the FCC’s chair, has said repeatedly that local stations don’t sufficiently have the power to push back and pre-empt national programs when they don’t think it’s in the best interest of their local viewers. Public comments are due on 10 December on the matter.Kimmel said the review was clearly related to what happened in September, when after only a few days – and facing intense pressure from viewers – Nexstar and Sinclair opted to bring back Kimmel’s show. “No doubt because of what happened the last time they tried to strangle me,” he said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

At the same time, China has used its dominance of production of certain critical materials and products to exert pressure.Lagarde argued that Europe was vulnerable because of a “dependency on third countries for our security and the supply of critical raw materials”. She cited China’scontrol of the supply of rare earth metalsthat are crucial in electric motors and wind turbines, as well as the “choke point” ofpower chips made by Nexperia in Chinathat threatened to shut down production across the global car industry.Speaking at the European Banking Congress in Frankfurt, Germany, Lagarde saidEuropehad failed to address its own problems. Policymakers had instead allowed its weaknesses to “erode growth quietly, as each new shock nudges us onto a slightly lower trajectory”.“Our internal market has stood still, especially in the areas that will shape future growth, like digital technology and artificial intelligence, as well as the areas that will finance it, such as capital markets,” she said.Europe also faced a “vicious circle” of its own savers allocating money to US stocks, helping the American economy to advance faster than the EU and leaving “stagnating productivity at home and growing dependence on others”, she said.Lagarde did highlight some European strengths as well, including a resilient labour market, increasing digital investment, andgovernment spending, particularly on defencein response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, that has counteracted economic slowdown.Part of Lagarde’s prescription for recovery was lowering barriers to services and goods trade between EU countries. Those barriers are equivalent to a 100% tariff on services and 65% on goods, according to ECB analysis. Lowering those barriers to the same level as the Netherlands – a relatively open economy – would fully make up for the hit from US tariffs, she said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

For all of the somewhat surreal edge of seeing Donald Duck and Goofy outside garages, the fact Disney has chosen F1 as a partner is indicative of the sea change the sport has brought about in a market it has long coveted.‘I still see title as quite distant’: F1 leader Norris not hedging bets for Las Vegas GPRead moreAs little as a decade ago it would have been unthinkable that an American institution such as Disney would have chosen to hitch its wagon to F1, which was barely even a niche sport in North America. Yet this weekend in Vegas marks the beginning of a two-year collaboration. Mickey and his pals in the Disneyland Band will perform the national anthem pre‑race and feature as part of the post-race driver celebrations at the Bellagio fountains.That the sport and Disney are celebrating here is entirely apt. The streets of Las Vegas, beneath the neon and the roving searchlights, are thronging with race fans. The rain that has swept in this week giving the buildings a clean and the Nevada desert a welcome top-up has singularly failed to dim anyone’s enthusiasm. These fans are the vanguard of F1’s popularity in the US.The sport has justsigned a new deal with Applefor a reported $160m (£122m) a year over five years for the TV rights in the US. It is an enormous investment by the tech company, which believes the sport is now appealing to its audience, while F1 is convinced it is the best way to connect with its new US fanbase. Apple had previously hosted some Major League Baseball and Major League Soccer but a full season of every session of live F1 to all subscribers is on a different level entirely.View image in fullscreenOscar Piastri thunders down the Las Vegas street during practice.Photograph: Clive Mason/Getty ImagesEddy Cue, the vice-president of services for Apple, recently noted that on a dinner with Toto Wolff, the Mercedes team principal, in New York, the Austrian was stopped all the time for pictures. “Five years ago, nobody would know who Toto was as he was walking down Soho,” said Cue. “There’s a huge potential for the sport in the US specifically.”Research indicates that since 2017, whenLiberty Media took over F1, the number of US firms who are sponsors or partners with teams has risen from 44 to 125 this year. That number is expected to increase, particularly with the US marque Cadillac joining the grid next year.At the helm for this resurgence has been the Formula One Group chief executive, Stefano Domenicali, the former Ferrari team principal. The Italian, who had the bravery and commitment to believe a race in Vegas could be pulled off, thinks there is more to come. “The sky’s the limit,” he says. “I want us to have more than a billion fans worldwide and growing our fandom in the US can certainly help us to get there. We believe that once we’ve introduced people to the world of F1, they’ll be hooked.View image in fullscreenElvis has entered the paddock in Las Vegas.Photograph: James Sutton/Formula 1/Getty Images“I am always struck by the American love of their sports and how deeply it is part of day-to-day life. We need to keep evolving what we’re offering to reach a point where we’ve given both avid, existing and new, emerging fans so many reasons and opportunities to watch and hear about F1 that we’ve become part of the US culture.”On the streets in Las Vegas this weekend his vision can be seen writ large. F1 is snaring what is considered the golden ticket in terms of demographics – 47% of new US F1 fans are aged between 18 and 24 and more than half are female. These are numbers cricket and rugby would kill for. They are enthusiastic, with a fervour for the young drivers, coming unencumbered by the baggage of F1’s long and rightly celebrated legacy. Drive to Survive or this year’s enormously successful F1 film starring Brad Pitt might have enticed them in but F1 is delivering to keep them coming back.Lewis Hamilton defends work ethic after Ferrari chief’s ‘talk less’ rebukeRead moreSpeaking to fans at the track, the draw is less about tribal driver, national or team loyalties and more about simply having a good time. They revel in the spectacle, the lights, the show, the music, the food and drink that F1 has made such a point of delivering in Las Vegas as part of what is derided in sniffier circles as “entertainment”. Here no one cares, the partnerships with Disney, Hello Kitty and Lego are welcomed and the associated merchandise sells by the armful.View image in fullscreenDisney-branded Formula One merchandise sells by the armfuls.Photograph: Patrick T Fallon/AFP/Getty ImagesIt reflects a conscious change of direction that has worked so well. “When the sport came to the country previously, we thought we could just turn up for four days, race and everyone would love us,” says Domenicali. “Now we know we must keep engaging with our American fans and US culture until F1 becomes relevant and a part of it, so the biggest thing we’ve changed is how we interact with fans and how we speak to new audiences. We are now speaking with our US fanbase all year round, 24/7.”That this has been a success is manifest in an enormously impressive bottom line, founded partly on F1’s bet on making it in the US, one backed appropriately in Las Vegas by the sport itself promoting the race here. F1 now has a market value of $24bn, a figure that has risen by 25% in the past year and is now three timeswhat Liberty Media paid in 2017. These are numbers fuelled by the business behemoths such as DisneyWith it, of course, has come criticism, not least that the European heartlands of the sport have become marginalised at the expense of growth in the US and the pursuit of Middle-Eastern petrodollars. Yet the drive to expand in the US at least was always perhaps F1’s holy grail. Mickey in the pit lane? Times have changed and it’s Fantasia in Vegas for F1.Explore more on these topicsFormula One 2025US sportsMotor sportApple TV+Formula OnefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Some of the Dutch club’s internationals were on holiday, seven of their starters from the final would leave that summer and Copenhagen were well ahead in preparations, but even so, the scoreline was bruising. It felt as if Slot had to start all over again.“I can remember it like yesterday,” says Marino Pusic, Slot’s assistant atFeyenoordand earlier at AZ. “The score could have been even higher – that says enough.” Copenhagen’s then coach, Jess Thorup, described it as more akin to “a training session than an actual friendly match”. Two weeks later a stronger Feyenoord side lost 4-0 to the Belgian club Union Saint-Gilloise. Then came home defeats by Lyon and Osasuna.View image in fullscreenArne Slot (left of dugout) digests a 7-0 pre-season battering at home to Copenhagen in July 2022.Photograph: ANP/Getty ImagesAfter Liverpool werewell beaten by Manchester Cityin their most recent game, a scarcely imaginable seventh defeat in 10 matches, it was easy to imagine Slot was grappling for the first time with a slump and a rebuild. The coach’s smooth rise from Cambuur to Anfield, via AZ and Feyenoord, has delivered trophies and awards. How capable is he of digging a struggling team out of a hole?Feyenoord brushed off their summer of strife to win the Eredivisie, and if retaining the Premier League title looks beyond Slot, Pusic believes his former boss has the skills to turn around Liverpool’s season, which resumes at home to Nottingham Forest on Saturday.Premier League: 10 things to look out for this weekendRead more“It was worrying,” Pusic says, casting his mind back to Feyenoord’s troubles. “But once you recognise the cause, you know how to act and turn it around … Throughout the process we stayed cool, no unnecessary emotions. Arne is brilliant at that: he keeps a clear head, analyses things deeply and turns conclusions into action.“No one gave us any chance of winning the league that season. And yet the pieces slowly started to fall into place. We were proactive, brought in the right players – even though we had very little money – and, most of all, did the work on the training pitch, where we could improve and develop the players.”He sees parallels at Liverpool, where Slot is integrating several summer signings: “People often forget that the group dynamic is crucial. Bringing in five or six new players can throw the balance off temporarily. The group only starts functioning properly again once they can find a new rhythm, but before then they go through different phases. That goes beyond tactics or technique; it just takes time for the group to find its cohesion.”The evolution of Liverpool’s squad was overshadowed bythe death of Diogo Jotaand Pusic says the impact will have been bigger than many realise. He dealt with grief within his team soon after he left Feyenoord in 2023 to manage Shakhtar Donetsk. “The brother of my first-choice goalkeeper had died in the war,” Pusic says. “At that moment, you’re dealing with completely different things than football. So much hits you at once.View image in fullscreenLiverpool’s players show their disappointment after going 2-0 down at Manchester City this month – the 3-0 loss was their seventh defeat in 10 matches.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian“Diogo was incredibly important for them, both on and off the pitch. He was a teammate but also a close friend to many players, who could lean on each other for support. And then you suddenly lose that person in such a terrible way. It has a huge impact on everyone at the club, especially the squad. During the season, these things may fade a bit into the background, but they linger, and at difficult moments they can resurface.”Liverpool, as champions, have also had to adapt to a different approach from opponents, Pusic says: “You’re no longer the one chasing but the team being chased. That’s a big difference, also mentally, because you can’t win matches purely through tactics; you also need to win matches based on other emotional elements. The question is how you deal with this within the team. Who takes the initiative now, and who assumes which leadership roles? Those are the deeper layers of coaching, and they’re crucial.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He will have been working on new strategies, which take time to refine, according to Pusic. “If the opponent’s tactic is to play it long and focus on the second ball, then you have to adjust based on different elements. Who engages in the duel? Who goes to the second ball?”Two years ago Slot talked about his methods in Ronald Giphart’s bookHetbeste vanjezelf (The best of yourself), including outlining his detailed video work with players. “I’m constantly thinking about how we can further improve,” he said. “For example, by finding out how our next opponent applies pressure and how we could deal with that … You can’t win a match purely through analysis. Luck has to be on your side too, and everything comes down to fine margins, but from the outset I focus heavily on the analytical side. And on relationships, for example by having individual conversations with everyone.”View image in fullscreenArne Slot helped Feyenoord bounce back to a first league title in six years in 2023.Photograph: Hollandse Hoogte/ShutterstockLiverpool’s poor league start reminds Pusic of one other challenging moment in Slot’s career, during his second season with AZ. They drew their first five games, having finished the previous, unfinished coronavirus season second only on goal difference to Ajax. “That brought pressure with it, as we wanted to compete at the top of the Eredivisie, and it weighed on Arne,” Pusic says. “But it’s not comparable with the scrutiny at the top of the Premier League.”AZ got back to winning ways and Liverpool appeared to have found the way up when theybeat Aston Villaand Real Madridbefore their defeat at City. “Everyone goes through periods like that,” Pusic says. “The question is: what core qualities do you have to get through them more quickly? In that respect, being able to stay composed under pressure is crucial and Arne has that ability.”Explore more on these topicsArne SlotLiverpoolFeyenoordfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Chiefs special teams coach Dave Toub would gladly usher him right back out of the conversation.Toub, 63, said Trump’s critique doesn’t hold much weight.“He doesn’t even know what he’s looking at. He has no idea what’s going on with the kickoff rule,” Toub said. “Take that for what it’s worth. I hope he hears it.”Josh Allen sacked eight times as late interception dooms Bills in loss to TexansRead moreTheNFLaltered kickoff rules in back-to-back offseasons to address player safety and increase frequency of kickoffs. Concussions were the major injury concern and the league data showed a reduction of documented head injuries on kickoffs of nearly 43% in the first year of using the dynamic kickoff.Trump claimed the changes are no safer and appeared on the Pat McAfee Show to share his opinion with the former Indianapolis Colts special teamer, calling the NFL kickoff “terrible” and “demeaning”.“I hate the kickoff in football,” Trump said in the interview aired last week.“I think it’s so terrible. I think it’s so demeaning. I think it hurts the game, it hurts the pageantry. I’ve told that to Roger Goodell. And I don’t think it’s any safer. I mean, you still have guys crashing into each other. It’s the opposite of what the game – the ball is in the air, nobody’s moving. It’s supposed to be when the ball is in the air, when the ball is played, you’re supposed to be moving. The pageantry of the game is so badly hurt.“Toub, who also serves as assistant head coach to Andy Reid, has been with the Chiefs for 13 seasons. One of his prized pupils has been kicker and vocal Trump supporter Harrison Butker, a 2017 draft pick who developed into one of the franchise’s top three point-scorers.

Palmer was close to returning to first-team action after two months on the sidelines, only to stub the small toe on his left foot on a door on Wednesday night.Chelsea, who visit Burnley in the Premier League in Saturday’s lunchtime kick-off, had hoped the 23-year-old would be available for Tuesday’s Champions League tie against Barcelona or next weekend’s home game against Arsenal.“Unfortunately he had an accident at home two days ago and he hit his toe,” Enzo Maresca, the Chelsea head coach, said. “It’s nothing important, but for sure he’s not back next week. The only thing we know is that he’s not available for this week, next week. He’s not available for tomorrow for sure, Barcelona for sure, Arsenal for sure. It can happen. I wake up many times during the night to go to the toilet. I hit my head, my legs, my everything, so it can happen.“He was very close [to a return]. He was almost back after the groin [issue] and that’s very good news. And then again, he had this small problem and hopefully it’s nothing important.”Maresca said Palmer was not wearing a protective boot. “The last time I saw him was yesterday morning, and he was without socks, without flip-flops, he was without nothing. He was working OK. The problem is that it’s a small toe, so the contact with boots can be painful.”Palmer has avoided surgery on his groin and is keen to get back on the pitch after a frustrating start to the season. Chelsea have tried to manage him with rest. But time is of the essence for Palmer given that his place in England’s squad for next summer’s World Cup is on the line. England have heavy competition for places in attacking midfield, although there is confidence that Thomas Tuchel will find space for Palmer.Jacob Steinberg2.Iraola not worried by Semenyo’s futureAndoni Iraola has insisted he is not worried about speculation that the Bournemouth winger Antoine Semenyo could leave the club in January. It emerged during the international window that the 25-year-old Ghana international has a £65m release clause in the five-year contract he signed this summer.View image in fullscreenBournemouth’s Antoine Semenyo  has a £65m release clause in the five-year deal he signed this summer.Photograph: Robbie Jay Barratt/AMA/Getty ImagesHowever, when asked about the much-coveted Semenyo’s future before Saturday’s Premier League match with West Ham, Iraola said: “We are in November. Antoine is our player, he will continue being our player.“In January, you can ask me about the market in January, but right now I’m not worried about the next markets. It’s something that especially you know that I hate to talk about in August, January, the moments when the market is open, but it is not one of those moments. It’s November. ”PA Media3.Kolo Muani boost for Spurs’ derby hopesThomas Frank has been given a major boost for Sunday’s trip to Arsenal with Randal Kolo Muani available for the north London derby.The forward suffered a blow to his jaw in Spurs’ 2-2 draw with Manchester United on 8 November and subsequently missed international duty with France. He joined a lengthy injury list for Tottenham, but Frank provided positive updates on a number of players and Kolo Muani can unexpectedly play after he was fitted with a protective mask in training.View image in fullscreenRandal Kolo Muani will play in a protective face mask against Arsenal.Photograph: Marc Atkins/Getty Images“Pape [Sarr] trained today, ready and available. Lucas [Bergvall] trained today and is available. Kolo Muani, yes trained today, available – of course he has a mask he needs to play with,” Frank said.The defenders Ben Davies and Kota Takai also returned to training this week and centre-back Radu Dragusin took part in a behind-closed-doors friendly earlier this month to step up his recovery after he sustained anterior cruciate ligament damage in January. Archie Gray is another back and Mohammed Kudus, who missed international duty with Ghana, has also returned to training in a further boost for Frank. James Maddison, Yves Bissouma and Dejan Kulusevski remain sidelined along with Dominic Solanke, who has not featured since August 23 and had minor surgery on his ankle last month.PA Media4.Howe hopes goals reignite WoltemadeEddie Howe wants more from Nick Woltemade as Newcastle attempt to kick-start their season after the international break. The Magpies return to Premier League action against Manchester City on Saturday sitting 14th in the table with their domestic form in stark contrast to their performances in the Champions League.Germany international Woltemade, the club’s record £69m summer signing from Stuttgart, scored five times in his first eight appearances for the club. But he has managed just one in his last six and the head coach is hoping the three he scored in World Cup qualifiers against Luxembourg and Slovakia will set the 23-year-old off and running once again.View image in fullscreenNick Woltemade celebrates after scoring for Germany against Luxembourg during the international break.Photograph: Stefan Matzke/sampics/Getty Images“I have to say considering the lack of training time we’ve had with him, I think he’s done really, really well and he’s tried to implement as well as he can what we’ve asked him to do,” Howe said. “He started off really well in terms of goals. I think those goals in the international break will do him the world of good as well.“Confidence is everything to a centre-forward, so I think he can be really pleased with himself. But we have to demand more and we need more from him in the sense that he’s the focal point of the team. It’s such an important position. Everything will come around him in terms of our performance, so there are big expectations on him, there’s big pressure on his shoulders. He’s handled that really well so far. And then, of course, the team behind him have to deliver for him as well and we haven’t done that well enough in the last couple of away games.”PA Media5.Carvalho blow caps Brentford’s ‘tough week’Keith Andrews admitted it has been a “tough week” at Brentford following the news that Fabio Carvalho will miss the rest of the season with a serious knee injury. The Bees’ head coach revealed the Portuguese midfielder, who has made 33 appearances for the west London club since joining from Liverpool in August 2024, sustained an anterior cruciate ligament injury in training last week.“It’s been a tough week for obvious reasons – it’s devastating for him,” Andrews said. “I feel for him. He’s someone who I have a lot of respect for as a man. This season he’s not been given as many opportunities as I ideally would have liked. He knows that. Fabio knows he’ll get support from everybody at the football club during this difficult period.”View image in fullscreenFabio Carvalho sustained an anterior cruciate ligament injury in training last week.Photograph: Mike Egerton/PAIgor Thiago took his tally this season to nine goals in 12 appearances with a brace in the 3-1 win over Newcastle before the international break, seemingly bolstering his hopes of a call-up for Brazil. “He’s so important for us and the way we play,” added Andrews, who will also be without Josh Dasilva and Antoni Milambo for Saturday’s visit to Brighton.PA Media6.Silva does not fear sack as pressure mountsMarco Silva insists he remains “on the same page” with Fulham’s hierarchy as speculation mounts over his future at Craven Cottage. Silva is yet to respond to a new contract offer made by the club this week, with his deal set to expire at the end of the season.“We have been on the same page. Of course we don’t agree on everything – I think in your job you don’t agree on everything,” said Silva before Saturday’s Premier League match with Sunderland. “If you have been achieving great results all the seasons we have been here and sometimes overachieving as well, you cannot do it if you are not on the same page.”View image in fullscreenFulham manager Marco Silva insists he remains ‘on the same page’ with Fulham’s hierarchy.Photograph: Peter Byrne/PASilva was leading the list of top-flight managers in danger of the sack two weeks ago, after his side’s dismal defeat at Everton extended their poor run to five defeats from their last six games. He bemoaned the limited opportunity to put things right, with most of his squad jetting off on international duty shortly after the 2-0 loss at Hill Dickinson Stadium.“It was probably a moment to be together after the last match because we were clear with each other at the end of the game that it was not good enough,” added Silva. “We are ready to go but in terms of preparation it is not the ideal scenario. But it will be the same for our opponents, and we have to be ready to give a completely different answer to the last game.”PA MediaExplore more on these topicsFootballThe talkTottenham HotspurBrentfordNewcastle UnitedFulhamBournemouthChelseanewsShareReuse this content"

And still he came close to willing the Buffalo Bills to a victory before an interception in the final minute sealed their fate in a 23-19 loss.Allen took consecutive sacks on the Bills’ final possession, leading to a fourth-and-27, but Buffalo (7-4) gained 44 yards on a short pass from Allen to Josh Palmer, who tossed a lateral to Khalil Shakir. After a false-start penalty created a fourth-and-6 for Buffalo (7-4), Calen Bullock picked off Allen’s pass at the Houston 9 with 24 seconds left.Chiefs heir Gracie Hunt backs rival Super Bowl half-time show over Bad BunnyRead more“We had a chance to win it there at the end,” Allen said. “We did a good job of staying in it and our defense bailed us out a couple of times. We’ve got to find a way, and we didn’t.”It was tough for Allen to get anything going on a night he was sacked a career-high eight times and hit four other times. Allen threw for 253 yards with two interceptions and no touchdowns after accounting for six touchdowns in a win over Tampa Bay last week.“When they hit our quarterback 12 times, I don’t like that,” Bills coach Sean McDermott said. “I don’t like that stat at all. It’s just not a healthy way to play and it’s not a good way to keep our quarterback healthy for the rest of the season. We’ve got to play better.”Allen was slow to get up after a sack in the first half. He said he was OK and that his left shoulder “went a little numb” after he landed on it awkwardly. He was asked about being hit so many times on Thursday. “It’s not fun,” he said. “I ran into a couple myself. I’ve got to be better at throwing the ball away. Too many times, I was going backwards.”Allen lost 70 yards on the eight sacks. Will Anderson Jr. had two and a half sacks to lead the Texans. His second one came when he almost took Allen down near the line of scrimmage, but he wriggled away and Anderson got up and chased him across the field to drop him for an 18-yard loss to force a punt early in the third.The Bills played for a second straight game without receiver Keon Coleman after he was again a healthy scratch after he was late to a team meeting before their last game. He was previously benched for the first series of a loss to New England in Week 5 after also being late for a meeting.“Nothing new. We’re just taking it one day at a time,” McDermott said. “I thought he had a better week, but we’re taking it one day at a time. It wasn’t that it wasn’t thought about, but we went with the guys that give us the best chance.”Shakir led the Bills with eight receptions for 110 yards and James Cook had 116 yards rushing and a touchdown.Allen was disappointed that the Bills couldn’t make plays down the stretch. “Ultimately, we’ve got to execute, and we didn’t do a good job of that tonight,” he said. “Whatever situation and whatever circumstance, we’ve got to find a way, and we didn’t.”Explore more on these topicsNFLHouston TexansBuffalo BillsUS sportsShareReuse this content"

A pair of retreats in India, and a fresh start with his hometown Jets, helped him rediscover his lost joyJoseph D'HippolitoFri 21 Nov 2025 05.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 21 Nov 2025 16.25 ESTShareStepping on the ice for this season’s opening game signified far more than a return to routine for one of the NHL’s most decorated veterans.Jonathan Toews – the formerChicago Blackhawkscaptain who led the club to three Stanley Cups in six seasons – was not only making his debut for his hometown Winnipeg Jets. He was playing his first NHL game in two and a half years.Carter Hart’s return shows hockey’s redemption machine never stopsRead more“You want to soak it in,” he said. “It was more just trying to enjoy the surreal journey of being away from hockey for so long – the most time I’ve ever taken off since I was a kid playing – and then having the chance to do it not only in my hometown but in the NHL again.”Two extended trips to India helped set that journey’s direction. For two one-month stretches, in 2023 and 2024, the 37-year-old center undertook a rigorous detoxification program designed to help him recover from chronic respiratory problems and to quiet the relentless self-criticism that had dominated his career.Toews made an immediate impact in the NHL. In 2007-08, he led all rookies in goals. The next season, Chicago named him captain at just 20. By his third, he had led the Blackhawks to the first of three titles and won the Conn Smythe Trophy as the most valuable player in the playoffs.He added the Frank J Selke Trophy as the league’s best defensive forward in 2015, four NHL All-Star appearances and two Olympic gold medals with Canada in 2010 and 2014. Toews’ impact became so significant that the NHL named him one of its 100 greatest players in 2017, the league’s centennial year. But success was taking a toll.Since his teens, Toews had battled digestive and immunity issues that affected his sleep. At 21 he adopted a punishing regime of supplements and treatments, part of what earned him the nickname “Captain Serious”.“I was doing all sorts of different things and taking supplements,” he said. “My daily routine of recovery and performance was just nonstop, and I was overdoing a lot of different things.”His production began to wane. After career highs of 35 goals and 46 assists in 2018–19, he scored just 18 goals the following season. He missed the entire 2020–21 campaign with chronic inflammatory response syndrome, the result of contracting Covid-19. His trademark intensity, once an asset, had begun to work against him.View image in fullscreenFormer Blackhawks captian Jonathan Toews won three Stanley Cups in a six-year span with Chicago.Photograph: Bruce Bennett/Getty Images“I was making myself miserable,” Toews said. “Letting that anger and frustration pour over until I finally got the result I wanted.”His final season in Chicago, 2022–23, brought a career-low 16 assists, a year after posting a career-worst 12 goals. When the Blackhawks chose not to renew his contract, Toews reached a crossroads.“I was really exhausted and unwell,” he said. “I needed some time to create space in my life, let my body heal, let my mind heal, and just let the dust settle. When you’re living at a fast pace for a long time, there are parts of you that are in survival mode. You learn how to do things a certain way, and you stick to what works.Blood, bias and the Battle of Florida: how the NHL’s dirtiest rivalry exposed hockey’s old-boy rotRead more“But what brings you to a certain place isn’t necessarily what’s going to take you to the next level. I had some learning and growing up to do. I needed to reassess why I was doing what I was doing, to find my love for hockey again and get back to a place where I was enjoying life and not putting so much pressure on myself.”In summer 2023, Toews turned to Ayurveda, a traditional Indian medical practice incorporating herbal remedies, a vegetarian diet, meditation and cleansing treatments. After months of changing his diet and taking herbal tinctures, he travelled to India in September 2023 for a month-long panchakarma detox program.The first two weeks involved yoga, prayer, enemas, painful massage and mud baths designed to draw toxins from the body. That was followed by five days of consuming a ghee-based herbal tonic. Then came the most extreme stage: vomiting induced by drinking four liters of milk, four liters of salt water and four liters of an herbal decoction.“It’s definitely a rollercoaster ride,” Toews said. “You feel like you’re just depressed and down in the dumps. Then the next thing you know, you’re pushing a lot of toxins out of your cells and tissue. You can feel it. Then suddenly you’re feeling this lightness and clarity and energy.“It was remembering what it felt like to be a 13-year-old kid again, where you just have this complete clarity and natural energy. It was nice to feel that and have some tangible evidence that you’re moving in the right direction.”He returned to India for a five-week session last autumn, signed an incentive-laden deal with a $2m base salary on 1 July, and made his Jets debut on 9 October before a capacity crowd of 15,225 at Winnipeg’s Canada Life Centre.“It was electric,” said Paul Edmonds, the Jets’ play-by-play radio broadcaster. “There was a lot of anticipation. He left at 14 to go to school play in Minnesota (at a boarding school) and never came back to play again. Fans across the province wondered if this dream would ever come true.”View image in fullscreenJonathan Toews is introduced in his first game for the Winnipeg Jets in October.Photograph: Cameron Bartlett/Getty ImagesThe dream came with a dose of reality. With centers Adam Lowry (hip surgery) and Nikolaj Ehlers (free agency) unavailable, the Jets installed Toews as their de facto No 2 center. In the first 12 games without Lowry, he contributed two goals and five assists while averaging 16min 16sec of ice time.“We were going to be thin through the middle, but Jonathan has stabilised things,” said Winnipeg’s coach, Scott Arniel. “He’s allowed us to get some secondary scoring while getting himself back up and running – getting back to NHL pace, a new team, different teammates.”His reputation eased the transition. “He’s been seamless in the dressing room,” Arniel said. “He’s part of our leadership group and right in the middle of everything. When he speaks, the guys listen because of all he’s encountered in his career.”Toews also adjusted quickly on the ice. “It’s been fun playing with him,” said winger Alex Iafallo, who started the season on Toews’ line. “He fit right in. He’s done a great job understanding our structure and how we play. For him to come in and play the way he has is pretty spectacular.”Mark Scheifele, the franchise’s all-time scoring leader, said Toews has elevated his own game.“He has such a wealth of knowledge, so much experience,” Scheifele said. “He’s so good at faceoffs, so good at being in the right area, strong on the puck. The little details of the game that people don’t notice are the things I’ve learned.”For Toews, the lessons from India have softened an edge that once cut too sharply.“I used to be the type of person who drove myself constantly,” he said. “Now it’s more of a gentle process – being patient, finding the fun and creative process of working on your game, and just being in the present moment.”Arniel put it simply: “He’s done a great job. He’s like a little kid again.”Explore more on these topicsWinnipeg JetsNHLUS sportsChicago BlackhawksIce hockeyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

That state of affairs is slowly changingIlie Mitaru in Decatur, TexasFri 21 Nov 2025 05.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 21 Nov 2025 13.30 ESTShareBoosted by cultural phenomena like the hit series Yellowstone and Beyonce’s Cowboy Carter album and tour, rodeo and all things Western are enjoying a cultural resurgence. Attendance, broadcast and streaming viewership are at all time highs. So is the prize money, which is attracting more and more young athletes seeking a chance to make a name for themselves.But while rodeo is booming, athlete development remains antiquated.“The sport of rodeo is decades behind.” said Doug Champion, 36, founder of Optimal Performance Academy, a new rodeo school working to modernize athlete development in a sport whose frontier roots and culture of rugged individualism has been slow to adopt modern sports science. “It’s always been ‘rodeo cowboy,’ we are just now entering the chapter of the ‘rodeo athlete.’”Historically, there has been very little money to support anyone outside the very top rodeo athletes, which fostered a culture that prized tradition and toughness, as opposed to exploring innovation in their sport.View image in fullscreenJoe Ernst, head of rider development at the PBR, the world’s largest rodeo league, shows Matt Gordon how to work the chain to test pull-strength.View image in fullscreenColt Morrow undergoes sensorimotor testing with the VALD Performance team.View image in fullscreenSports biomechanist Kait Jackson and Joe Ernst, head of rider development at the PBR, watch as a rider captures his vertical jump for the VALD performance testing system.View image in fullscreenThe technology creates a benchmark simulation of each athlete, allowing them to see and address sport-specific weaknesses.“There’s a sense of being an outlaw, renegade, individualistic,” said Cody Custer, now 60, winner of the 1992 PRCA World Championship, and a teacher at the workshop. “I’m gonna just plug up and do my own thing and win this thing, as opposed to being oriented towards the organization, team sports, etc.”Rodeo athletes have traditionally come from ranching and farming families, which have always been medically under-served. These communities, says Champion, rarely went to the doctor and took pride in just “cowboying up” despite injuries or health issues. Young riders coming from these communities never expected, or received, much medical or performance-oriented care.“It was just a different way of thinking, no preparation, no taking care of your body, and if you’re hurt, sick or tired it doesn’t matter because being a cowboy is about being tough,” said Champion.View image in fullscreenPerformance coach Chase Dougherty tries to destabilize Dalton Dwyer on the bucking bull, a piece of training equipment meant to simulate the movement of a real bull.View image in fullscreenJose Ramirez grimaces during a strength drill.View image in fullscreenAttendees, most in their late teens and 20s, come from around the country to attend the five-day workshop.Photograph: Ilie MitaruView image in fullscreenMany rodeo athletes live out of their cars to save money.Rodeo athletes are largely freelancers, traveling on their own dime to competitions, hoping to place high enough to fund their next trip and entry fee. The vast majority of rodeo athletes still have day jobs.“Bull riding is a drug. It’s the most addictive thing that I’ve ever experienced in my entire life,” said Gabe Martin, 22, from Felton, Delaware, who works servicing public and residential ponds during the week and chases bull riding circuits on the weekend. “It’s engulfed my life and, and it seems I just can’t get away from it. “Optimal Performance Academy attracts young athletes from across the country to their week-long training camps. The workshops are a mix of theory and practice. The theory includes guidance on nutrition, attracting sponsors through social media, personal finance lessons, and goal-setting and visualization. The practice portion of the workshop includes performance testing, rodeo-specific workouts, practice on bucking machines and two days of live bull riding.View image in fullscreenThe riders take a moment for group prayer to ask for protection before the day’s riding begins.View image in fullscreen‘I think rodeo is stuck in tradition, and I think that people fear that with change will come loss of tradition,’ said Doug Champion, above, who founded Optimal Performance Academy in 2023.View image in fullscreenChampion partnered with a local stock contractor to bring 88 bulls that the riders will cycle through for the workshopFor their seventh-ever workshop in Decanter,Texas, Champion brought in an Australian pioneer in VALD, a type of performance testing which uses force plates, dynamometers, motion capture, and ocular and vestibular testing to measure a wide range of key metrics. The idea is to understand the strengths and weaknesses of each athlete, and then build personalized training programs off that data.This testing is ubiquitous across most professional and college level elite sports, but this is the first time it’s been used for amateur bull riders.View image in fullscreenWyatt Bowman falls off the back of a bull.View image in fullscreenRyan Jae, Braulio Barraza and  Jose Ramirez watch their fellow classmate.View image in fullscreenEd Huffman tries to untangle a rider’s leg from a raging bull.View image in fullscreenAlec Richardson celebrates a successful ride.“The biggest thing that we realized is nothing about rodeo that happens physically is normal or natural to the body. In no way shape or form through regular exercise patterns or everyday life are you going to improve your ability to perform in the arena,” said Champion.Champion, who was a promising young rider in his own right, broke his back in 2010 falling off a bronco. His long, painful road to recovery led him to realize how much more rodeo athletes could be doing to increase their strength and technique while riding, and build resilience to bounce back after injuries.“It was just get on as many horses as you can because if you get on more, you’ll figure it out sooner,” said Champion. “Well, I got on 300 horses and got my absolute dick slammed in the dirt every time and I didn’t learn anything.”View image in fullscreenAlec Richardson holds his knee in pain after a hard fall.View image in fullscreenA medical team and ambulance is on standby throughout the entire workshop.View image in fullscreenDalton Dwyer watches playback of his ride with a handful of coaches.Champion’s hope is to shorten the training time for young riders trying to break into the pro circuits, giving them more healthy years to compete and earn a living. Rodeo is notoriously brutal on the body, with most riders forced into retirement from injuries in their late 20s or early 30s.“It’s just a totally different approach than the trial by fire that has been the history of how you learn in rodeo,” said Champion.View image in fullscreenMatt Gordon takes a moment before his next ride.Explore more on these topicsSportThe Guardian picture essayPhotographyTexasUS sportsShareReuse this content"

They travelled to the north-east on Friday afternoon, leading to a change in routine at the Etihad Campus and an early pre-match press conference in order to comply withPremier Leaguerules and avoid another punitive fee.‘He keeps a clear head’: how Slot’s last slump offers blueprint for Liverpool revivalRead moreAsked how many fines he has previously received, Guardiola said: “A lot. Sometimes I arrive one minute later but the rules are the rules. We are training later and if we train at 12 until 1.30, I cannot be here [at the press conference] in time. The Premier League don’t allow me at 2pm. The club said if I don’t start by 2pm they will fine me or fine the club.“We paid a lot of money as I’m late at half-time, butwhen we played in the Champions League finalthey had a show before the game and they are always late. They have to fine the singers! That is why I decided 9am and the journalists have had their breakfast and will need to take a coffee.”City brushed aside champions Liverpoolin their last Premier League game before the international break. It was an indication that they are ready to challenge for the title after a disappointing campaign last season and are boosted by having only the midfielders Rodri and Mateo Kovacic missing for the trip to St James’ Park. “If we continue the squad fit, we’ll compete every single game and every single competition, I don’t have any doubts about that,” Guardiola said.View image in fullscreenErling Haaland celebrates scoring in City’s win over Liverpool.

Plans to expand the business are intended to lead to more sporting success, but it remains to be seen whether they can take the next step and challenge Arsenal for the Premier League title.Premier League: 10 things to look out for this weekendRead moreArsenal, top going into Sunday’s north London derby, showed their intent when they bought Declan Rice from West Ham for £105m in 2023. Spurs’ record buy is the £60m Richarlison in 2022.Frank is unsure whether his predecessor, Ange Postecoglou, was right to predict last year that Spurs will never spend £100m on one player. “In the next 50 years?” he said. “Then yes.“To build, you need a combination of time and doing the processes. Depending on where the team come from, of course. But to stay up there is still very difficult. So time and ­process, and, then of course, investment.“If you want success in football, you need to invest in players. Hopefully do it cleverly and we want to do it smart so we don’t invest too much on the wrong players. But you need to invest, £100m, I don’t know. Let’s see. I don’t think we are close to spending £100m, put it that way.”Frank considered whether Spurs, who are fifth, would need to spend heavily to catch Arsenal. “I’m a big believer that we need to develop the players we have,” he said. “If you can develop players, not all of them should cost £60m, £70m, £80m, £90m, whatever the amount. I don’t think anybody has done that. ­Liverpool didn’t do that to get to the top. Even [Manchester] City hasn’t done that.“You need to be good at developing the players, which I believe we are. You also need to invest in the right potential of a player. Declan Rice is a good example. How old was he when he joined Arsenal? Twenty-four or 25? That’s important.

It’s like that, it feels natural and normal and very special.”Edwards has swapped Middlesbrough, whom he joined in the summer, for a club and city he knows well. “My best years as a player were here,” he says of his century of appearances as a defender. “And I have some amazing memories as a coach, in my first sort of proper job, if you like.” He was appointed Under-18s head coach a year after his 2013 retirement.View image in fullscreenRob Edwards impressed during his brief time at Middlesbrough.Photograph: Owen Humphreys/PAHe worked as a first-team coach under Kenny Jackett and Paul Lambert either side of that caretaker spell when Walter Zenga was sacked and took his maiden steps in management with Telford, his home-town club, in the National League.He came back to Wolves as Under-23s coach in 2018 before returning to frontline management with Forest Green in League Two. The 42-year-old had never really faded from the sight of the Wolves chair, Jeff Shi, and the rest of the hierarchy, who interviewed him before Julen Lopetegui took charge three years ago. Edwards had established Boro as promotion contenders after 14 league matches, but felt compelled to accept Wolves’s offer when the call came.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I get it and I understand that. But this is something I’ve always wanted to do.“I didn’t want to live with regret. I didn’t want to look back and think: ‘Maybe I should have given that a go.’ I know it’s going to be a big challenge, but I’m well up for it.”For Edwards, it is a return to the biggest stage, to which he led Lutonvia a Wembley playoff finaltwo years ago. Shi has spoken of Edwards succeeding Vítor Pereira as an opportunity of a hard reset after a few years of circling the drain and all parties acknowledge time is against them if Wolves are to avoid returning to the second tier for the first time since 2017-18.“I do want to be here for the long term, but I’m well aware that to be able to do that you need results,” Edwards says. “There is a realism to these discussions: we know where we’re at. We can’t hide away, bury our heads in the sand and then all of a sudden get caught out if things don’t go the way we want. We have to be prepared for all scenarios.”There are familiar faces, too, from 86-year-old Brenda in the canteen to Dave the cleaner. “He was calling me ‘boss’ the other day which felt weird, so I said: ‘Dave, just call me Rob.’View image in fullscreenEdwards meets employee Brenda in the Wolves canteen.Photograph: Brett Patzke/Wolves/Getty Images“I have seen lots of friendly faces, which has been nice; Doc [Matt Doherty], who I coached when I was here previously. Hugo [Bueno], who was a young lad in the Under-18s when I was coaching the Under-23s. But the more the club has grown and the more years it’s been in the Premier League, there are more and more people around so there are a lot of new names to learn.”Edwards starts at home to Crystal Palace on Saturday. How does he expect to feel on the touchline? “I’ll be nervous, because it’s a very big moment and a very big game,” he says. “But I’ll be excited and very proud. Unfortunately, the one thing I can’t guarantee is wins, but we can guarantee we’re going to try absolutely everything to try and achieve them.

The clubs voted overwhelmingly against the introduction ofcontroversial anchoring plans.Under SCR, clubs will be asked to limit spending on squad costs – including transfer fees and player wages – to within 85% of their football-related revenue and net profit/loss from player sales. The sale of capital assets is not included within this allowance.In July, Everton sold their women’s team to Roundhouse Capital Holdings, a parent company controlled by Dan Friedkin, chair of the club’s owner, The Friedkin Group. The move was made with the intention of attracting new investment for Everton Women but also affected the Merseysiders’ PSR calculation, allowing greater room for transfer spending.Quick GuideHow do I sign up for sport breaking news alerts?ShowDownload the Guardian app from the iOS App Store on iPhone or the Google Play store on Android by searching for 'The Guardian'.If you already have the Guardian app, make sure you’re on the most recent version.In the Guardian app, tap the Menu button at the bottom right, then go to Settings (the gear icon), then Notifications.Turn on sport notifications.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Chelsea achieved a similar feat last year when theysold two Stamford Bridge hotels to a sister company. Both moves were approved by the Premier League under existing rules but would not be allowed under the new regulations.SCR will be in place from next season and could see clubs deducted points for the following campaign if rules are breached excessively. If clubs exceed the 85% spending level, known as the “green threshold”, they will be liable to a fine. Exceeding a “red threshold” of 115% of spending will result in a sporting sanction, most likely the deduction of points. Any fines will be put into a collective pot and shared between teams who have fully complied with SCR.SCR will exist alongside a similar set of constraints imposed by Uefa on clubs in European competition, rules which this season apply to nine Premier League clubs. The six clubs who voted against SCR are understood to be Bournemouth, Brighton, Brentford, Crystal Palace, Fulham and Leeds.The proposal to introduce top-to-bottom anchoring (TBA) was rejected by 12 votes to seven, with one abstention, as clubs turned against plans that would have imposed a hard cap on squad costs at a multiple of the football revenues of the league’s lowest side. The vote followed threats of possible legal action from the Professional Footballers’ Association (and player agencies.A third measure, referred to as sustainability and systematic resilience (SSR), was approved unanimously. This system will look to test clubs to ensure they have sufficient funds to cope with short, medium and long-term financial risks.The Premier League said it had developed the new financial system through “extensive consultation with clubs and a wide range of stakeholders” and that it was devised to work “effectively in parallel with Uefa’s rules and is consistent with the objectives of the Independent Football Regulator”.The Premier League also announced it would push back the start of next season by one week to give players more time to recuperate after the World Cup. The opening match round will begin on the weekend of Saturday 22 August 2026, 33 days after the World Cup final, and the final round will be on Sunday 30 May 2027. There will be a return to a more traditional Boxing Day fixture list, after only one game was scheduled for this year.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueFinancial fair playFinancesnewsShareReuse this content"

It was impossible to measure the excitement in a seven-year-old from Norway making his first pilgrimage to Anfield. Inside was the promise of watching his favourite player, Daniel Sturridge, and the rest of a freewheeling side throwing everything at a title push. But as Sindre Walle Egeli and his family reached the turnstiles, the cruelest of realities dawned.“It’s not a good memory,” Walle Egeli says. “We showed up, ready to go, and it turned out we’d got fake tickets. I don’t know what happened, maybe my parents bought from some shady people. It was heartbreaking.”English football has dealt him a kinder hand now. The 19-year-old is sitting in a makeshift meeting room at Ipswich Town’s training ground; outside loom the girders of a new complex that will transform their base next season. His move from Nordsjælland in August, the initial £17.5m fee aChampionshiprecord, was a statement of ambition from both parties. It was the pathway to Premier League football Walle Egeli had craved; Ipswich, despite stern competition, had landed one of the most sought-after prospects in Europe.“I had a lot of different options but this is a special club,” he says. “I knew it was the toughest choice I could make – it’s probably the toughest league in the world physically – but I wanted the challenge. I know I’m going to develop a lot here.”Why the eye-watering outlay for a player with 43 appearances in Denmark and a handful of outings in Norway’s fourth division? One answer is readily at hand. Walle Egeli has just returned from scoring the winner for Norway Under-21s in Bosnia and Herzegovina – “a scrappy one, not my favourite” – and putting another notch in the record books.View image in fullscreenSindre Walle Egeli, celebrating after scoring for Norway Under-21s last year, has one senior cap.Photograph: Sipa US/AlamyNobody, not even Erling Haaland, has scored as many goals for the country’s age-group sides. Walle Egeli scored a six-minute hat-trick for the under-17s and made his senior debut against Kazakhstan last September at a younger age than Haaland achieved. His record is phenomenal and, taken on its own, breeds obvious comparisons.“That’s easy when you’re scoring,” he says. “But I’m not even close to being the same player as him. Of course it’s nice to hear because he’s the best player in the world now, but I wouldn’t compare us. I don’t mind it but I’d never think: ‘OK, I’m better than Haaland.’ He’s a top finisher and there’s a lot I can learn through him.”Besides, Walle Egeli has never been a pure centre-forward. Most of his contributions have come from a starting position on the right. A wand-like left foot, honed during a happy childhood 80 miles south of Oslo in Larvik, has been largely responsible. “It’s come naturally but also with a lot of practice,” he says. “My first football memories are of me, my brother and dad going to the nearest pitch and just shooting with my left foot.”Their father, who passed down the Liverpool obsession, had played in Norway’s lower divisions for Fram Larvik. His brother, Vetle, is two years older and thriving with the nearby top-flight club Sandefjord. The pair played together for the under-21s last week, against Israel.“He’s a left-back, also a good left foot, so there were a lot of battles between us,” he says. “But we know each other’s movements and I know which passes he’s good at.” Any goalscoring combinations in the under-21 team? “Should have been! He gave me a clear open goal against Wales and I missed it. He’s very mad at me.”Walle Egeli played in Vetle’s age group from the start, learning technique had to be king against bigger, older boys. He has become a six-footer with laudable aptitude for the Championship’s endless duels. But size was less helpful when a close-knit, “quite special”, group came through at the local club Nanset.They raced to sign up when Liverpool’s international academy gave a training camp in Larvik. “I spent three days trying to replicate Sturridge’s ‘trivela’ against Sevilla,” he says, laughing. “I was so happy once I finally got it.” It was his first time exposed to English outside an academic environment. His mother, a teacher at his school, helped make sure he stayed focused away from football.View image in fullscreenSindre Walle Egeli grew up playing against bigger, older boys and has felt at home in the Championship with Ipswich.Photograph: MatchDay Images Limited/AlamyNowadays he is fluent, talking with self-belief that never skirts arrogance. It was important to stay grounded even when, having joined Sandefjord’s academy at 13, he found himself outshining players at least three years his senior. He had recently turned 15 when a senior debut beckoned. Playing for Sandefjord reserves against an older Teie team, Walle Egeli scored all of the game’s five goals.“The last one was best. I got the ball from my friend Sebastian Mathisen, cut inside and then … top corner. I still remember it really well. It was probably a little bit embarrassing for them. It’s not like you could take the ball and just dribble past everyone, but I wouldn’t say the level was that good.”Still, it hardly occurs every day. Walle Egeli continued scoring prolifically until being stopped in his tracks. He felt cast aside during his final six months at Sandefjord, having decided he would leave upon turning 16.“Once they found out I wasn’t signing the contract there, they totally froze me out,” he says. Samir Saric, a coach whose influence he cherishes, took pains to keep him engaged. “Samir was great with me. I wasn’t given a GPS vest like the other guys, things like that, but he always supported me. We’d stay after training, even after games where I played zero minutes, and work on finishing.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It just seemed harsh treatment for a 15-year-old trying to find his way. “It shocked me and my family, to be honest,” he says. “It was one of the hardest points of my career and I have some regrets from that time, not even being able to play football. But I have a lot of good relationships there and I’m really happy they’re doing well now.”Nordsjælland beat PSV, FC Copenhagen and others to his signature. Their academy has a breathtaking hit rate and is feted for its pastoral care. “There’s no better place for a young player,” he says. “They really took care of me, made sure I had things to do in my spare time, gave me food, everything. They made it a lot easier. It would have been more difficult if I had gone anywhere else.”When he burst into action last season, his first full campaign in Denmark’s Superliga, another move was inevitable. Nine goals and eight assists were a healthy return from a year in which he felt his playmaking ability kick on; two of each followed early in 2025-26 before Ipswich, who host Wrexham on Saturday, followed up their longstanding interest. He is yet to score but there is no panic. Walle Egeli likes the way, since joining Kieran McKenna’s revamped team, he has learned to take greater joy in teammates’ successes. Like a side quietly beginning to justify their status as promotion favourites, he is visibly growing with each game.View image in fullscreenSindre Walle Egeli feels Ipswich, who play Wrexham on Saturday, are ‘starting to really get into the flow’.Photograph: Joshua Bright/The Guardian“It’s going in the right direction,” he says. “People can look at the goal tally and say it hasn’t gone that well, but those who actually watch the games would say I’m in a very good place now. I’m sure we’re going to be very successful. We have so much talent, so many good players, it’s crazy. Now we’ve had two months together to get to know each other. It can be difficult in the beginning but I feel like we’re starting to really get into the flow.”Family never seem too far away: he loves taking feedback from his grandfather, who watches his games on repeat before calling with advice. It helps, though, that another member of Norway’s seemingly endless production line is also taking the Championship’s hard knocks. Walle Egeli and Sverre Nypan, who is on loan at Middlesbrough from Manchester City, have played for the national youth teams since under-15 level.“He’s one of my better friends,” he says. “It’s very nice to have a mate you can talk to. We share the same thoughts about the Championship, its intensity and how tough it is. We talk before and after our games.” They also compete regularly on PlayStation games such as EAFC and Fortnite.Both have one senior cap. Walle Egeli talks thoughtfully about the lack of real role models in Norway’s national team while he was growing up, save perhaps for Joshua King, and how the past decade’s investment in coaches and facilities is bearing spectacular fruit. There is still time to join Ståle Solbakken’s free-scoring team next summer.“I remember 10 years ago saying I want to play in the 2026 World Cup,” he says. “Now I think I’m quite close. If I play well and do good things here, there’s a good chance.” A reunion with Haaland, who offered helpful tips during that call-up in 2024, would be welcome.Everything, from his raw talent to the expert tutelage of McKenna, is in place for a happy resolution. Walle Egeli’s experience at Anfield had one of those. His grandparents, saddened at the sight of their loved ones returning so disconsolately, arranged tickets to the following month’s game with Swansea. This time it was for real. Liverpool won 4-3 and, to top it, Sturridge scored twice.So what about a perfect hat-trick: promotion with Ipswich, a World Cup with Norway and a Premier League opener at the stadium that once thrilled him? “Three in a row, let’s go for it,” he says. “I think they’re in reach.”Explore more on these topicsIpswich TownChampionshipinterviewsShareReuse this content"

Arteta, whose side are four points clear at the top of the Premier League, believes he has a deep enough squad to cope without Gabriel.“He’s going to be out for weeks,” he said. “It’s clearly a blow because it’s our leader in our backline and to me it’s obviously never a positive thing. The good thing is that we have very good options and people have to stand up now and do their job.”Arsenal have conceded only five goals in 17 matches this season and Cristhian Mosquera or Piero ­Hincapié, both signed in the summer to provide more defensive cover, are in line to replace Gabriel. It is understood that the captain, Martin Ødegaard, could return from a knee injury against Spurs having been outsince the start of Octoberbut Arteta would not speculate when Gabriel Martinelli, Viktor Gyökeres or Noni Madueke may be back.Bukayo Saka is expected to retain the armband if Ødegaard is not ready to start and Arteta expressed confidence that the England forward would extend his contract, which expires in 2027. “What I’m very aware of is that he wants to continue with us, that he’s very happy,” he said.Explore more on these topicsArsenalnewsShareReuse this content"

Asked how long the 22-year-old will be out of action, Amorim said: “He’s going to stay a few weeks out. I don’t know how long, but he’s not that serious. We have to be careful with him. He’s going to recover, he’s feeling better. So in a few weeks, I expect to have Ben.”Premier League clubs can no longer sell hotels or women’s team to comply with PSRRead moreMbeumo, Diallo and Noussair Mazraoui will join up with Cameroon, Côte d’Ivoire and Morocco, respectively, next month in preparation for Afcon, which starts in Morocco on 21 December. Mbeumo and Diallo have been used as forwards by Amorim this season, making Sesko’s return especially important.“I don’t want to say for sure, but when they are going to the Afcon, I expect to have Ben back,” said Amorim. “We have the rules [regarding the release of players for international duty]; when we have to release the players, we’ll see. We are doing our job to try to maintain the players a little bit longer, but it’s not just in our hands. We need to respect that, but we’ll try to do everything to protect the club, protect the players and protect the national teams.”Harry Maguire is not fit enough to face Everton in United’s next league game on Monday, having sustained a hamstring strain against Spurs, while Kobbie Mainoo will have a test on a minor knock on Saturday. Lisandro Martínez, meanwhile, is still recovering from a long-term knee injury. Amorim was asked if the centre-back might play as a defensive midfielder when he does return to action. “In an emergency he can play [there],” said the Portuguese.Amorim also stated his belief that Luke Shaw can play as a left wing-back. “The load that a player does in that position is a bit different [but] he is more prepared to do that,” he said. “He is a smart player.”Explore more on these topicsManchester UnitednewsShareReuse this content"

Slot had hoped the 26-year-old’s match fitness would improve during the international break, but he played only 28 minutes of Sweden’s defeat by Switzerland before sitting out their game against Slovenia to avoid the risk of being suspended for next year’s World Cup playoff.‘I couldn’t get Diogo Jota out of my head’: Andy Robertson reflects on shared World Cup dreamRead moreSlot has several fitness issues and expects to be without right-backs Conor Bradley and Jeremie Frimpong for several weeks. Florian Wirtz will also be absent against Forest having sustained a muscle problem with Germany.Getting Isak up to speed after an underwhelming start to his Liverpool career remains a priority and Slot admits he may have no alternative but to select the club-record ­signing over fitter options such as Hugo Ekitiké.“This team can and will play much better if you give them a little bit more time,” the head coach said. “We can improve as a team and we will improve definitely as individuals because players will be adapted to the league much better. Alex will end up being the player he was at Newcastle if we get him fit. That will take a little bit of time.”Slot added: “This morning I had a conversation with the performance staff about what is the best way for Alex – not for Liverpool – to get him as fast as we can to 100%. I always have to find the balance between what is the best for him as an individual and for us as a team.“I do know that a 100% fit Alexander Isak is a big, big, big plus for this team. But for him to get there he might need to have minutes where you could argue that another player might be further ahead of him in terms of match fitness.”Bradley is facing at least three weeks out having being injured in Northern Ireland’s win over ­Luxembourg on Monday. Liverpool play seven games in 22 days from Saturday and are likely to be stretched at right-back throughout that period.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Joe Gomez has played there as well but Joe has played, I think I’m correct, 90 minutes twice throughout the whole of this year. If we want to keep him available longer it is maybe a risk to play him seven times in 22 days.

Ojomoh has been thrust into the No 12 jersey for a first Twickenham start in place of the injured Fraser Dingwall but Maro Itoje believes the Bath centre will flourish against Argentina.Dingwall’s withdrawal with a side strain sustained last weekend is further upheaval for Borthwick, who has already lost Ollie Lawrence, Jamie George and Tom Roebuck since the33-19 triumph over the All Blacks. With Tommy Freeman and Ollie Chessum also injury casualties of the autumn, Borthwick’s ranks have been depleted but Ojomoh has been in fine fettle for Bath this season and impressed on his debut against the USA last summer.Would South Africa look enviously at England’s game? Probably not, but the gap is closing | Ugo MonyeRead moreHis inclusion alongside Henry Slade means a seventh different centre partnership of the year for Borthwick, who may have thought he had unearthed his combination for the future in Dingwall and Lawrence last weekend. The England head coach has repeatedly talked up Ben Earl’s ability to play at centre but has resisted the temptation to move the back-row to midfield, handing Ojomoh, the son of ex-England and Bath flanker Steve, the chance to stake a claim.“He has a bit of a swagger about the way he is around the place, and with the way he plays,” said Itoje. “He obviously comes from a rich rugby heritage family, second generation in his family to be playing for England, so I know this weekend is going to be incredibly special for his family and for himself. I’ve been admiring his play from afar and now I get the opportunity to play with him.“I got a call some years ago, and I didn’t have his number at the time, and Steve [Ojomoh] basically asked me to talk to Max – this must have been four or five years ago. I’d never met Max, hadn’t spoken to him, obviously heard about his son who was coming up through the ranks in Bath, and he asked me to speak to Max and tell him to study, to keep on his education. I was like: ‘Look, how can I tell this guy to study? I don’t even know him; I haven’t met him.’“It would be pretty weird if I’d just called him up and just been like: ‘Stay in school.’ I said I’d do it the next time I see him, but the opportunity didn’t come until a few years down the line when I eventually shared the story with him. But I think he is studying now [Ojomoh completed a business and administration degree over the summer], his dad’s influence is working. I’ve been an admirer of the legacy that his dad and that generation of British Nigerians have done in the England jersey.”England are bidding to round off 2025 with an 11th consecutive win – the only defeat of the year so farcoming against Ireland in February– and the first clean sweep of four November Tests since Eddie Jones’s first autumn in charge in 2016. Argentina were victorious the last time they met England at Twickenham in 2022, however, and Itoje is aware of the threat posed by the Pumas – who have already beaten Walesand Scotlandthis month.The Argentina head coach, Felipe Contepomi, has made five changes to the side that beat Scotland with Tomás Albornoz returning at fly-half and Marcos Kremer coming back into the side in the back-row. The matchday squad features 10 players who ply their trade in the Prem, including Itoje’s Saracens teammate Juan Martín González, who shifts to blindside flanker and the Harlequins winger Rodrigo Isgró.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Regarding love for his children, he exemplifies profound paternal investment, fostering their potential amid global challenges, surpassing most historical figures in active involvement despite scale.”Musk wasalso funnierthan Jerry Seinfeld, according to Grok, and he would have risen from the dead faster than Jesus.Many of the Grok responses were quietly deleted on Friday, andMusk postedthat Grok had been “unfortunately manipulated by adversarial prompting into saying absurdly positive things about me”.Musk has in the past been accused of changing Grok’s responses to better suit his preferred worldview.In July, Musk said he was changing Grok’s method of response to stop “parroting legacy media” in stating that political violence comes more from the right than the left.Shortly after, Grokbegan praising Hitler, referring to itself as “MechaHitler”, and made antisemitic comments in response to user queries.Musk’s artificial intelligence company xAI issueda rare public apologyafter the incident, stating “we deeply apologize for the horrific behavior that many experienced”. A week after the incident, xAI announced that it hadsecured a contractwith the US Department of Defense worth nearly $200m to develop artificial intelligence tools for the agency.In June,Grok repeatedly brought up “white genocide”in South Africa in response to unrelated queries, until it was fixed in a matter of hours. “White genocide” isa far-right conspiracy theorythat has been mainstreamed by figures such as Musk and Tucker Carlson.X was approached for comment.Explore more on these topicsElon MuskXArtificial intelligence (AI)newsShareReuse this content"

Sign up hereSasha MistlinFri 21 Nov 2025 12.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 21 Nov 2025 12.02 ESTShareBarely a month goes by withoutmore newsof streaming sites overtaking traditional, terrestrial TV. Predominant among those sits YouTube, with more than2.5 billion monthly viewers. For people my age – a sprightly 28 – and younger, YouTube is less of an app or website than our answer to radio: the ever-present background hum of modern life. While my mum might leave Radio 4 wittering or BBC News flickering in the corner as she potters about the house, I’ve got a video essay about Japan’s unique approach to urban planning playing on my phone. That’s not to say I never watch more traditional TV (although 99% of the time I’m accessing it through some other kind of subscription streaming app), but when I get home after a long day and the thought of ploughing through another hour of grim prestige fare feels too demanding, I’m probably watching YouTube. Which means it’s very unlikely that I’m watching the same thing as you.When Google paid$1.65bn for the platform in 2006, (just 18 months after it launched) the price seemed astronomical. Critics questioned whether that valuation could be justified for any video platform. The logic was simple – unless YouTube could replace television, it would never be worth it. Nearly two decades on, that framing undersells what actually happened. YouTube didn’t just replace television – it invented entirely new forms of content: vodcasts, vlogs, video essays, reaction videos, ASMR and itsheinous cousin mukbang. The platform absorbed new trends and formats at lightning speed, building what became an alternative “online mainstream”. Before podcasters, TikTokers, Substackers and even influencers, there were YouTubers.I started paying forYouTubePremium during Covid, when I had an abundance of time, and spare cash without the need to commute or the potential of buying pints. Now, it’s the only subscription that I don’t worry about the value of, but rather wonder if I use it so much that it’s changed me as a person. Alas, my gym membership does not fall into this category.The obvious advantage to the premium subscription is never seeing ads, and the smart downloads that automatically queue up episodes based on your habits have been a blessing on many a long tube journey. I’m very rarely bored these days; on my commute now, instead of staring out the window and letting my mind wander, I’m either watching sports highlights or a podcast. I no longer really think about stuff – I just go on YouTube.View image in fullscreenDonald Trump, right, on Joe Rogan’s podcast, which airs on YouTube.Photograph: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBMoPUAeLnYIt’s slightly embarrassing to admit that a random deluge of shorts featuring guitar instructors and teenage garage bands has inspired me to pick up the instrument again – like admitting that you met your partner on Hinge. But that’s the thing – YouTube has democratised expertise in ways traditional media never could. It also fits in with the etiquette around media consumption on your phone. I’d never desecrate a Spielberg or Scorsese film by watching one on a 6in display. That feels vaguely heinous – disrespectful to the craft. But watching behind-the-scenes footage or promo tour clips? That’s exactly what YouTube is for.I watch a mix of YouTube-native creators – Amelia Dimoldenberg’s Chicken Shop Date, JxmyHighroller for NBA deep dives, Tifo Football for tactical analysis, Happy Sad Confused for film interviews – and a steady diet of content traditionally formatted for TV or print but which probably now reaches the biggest audience via YouTube: Graham Norton, Saturday Night Live, even fellow journalists such as Owen Jones and Mark Kermode. And sports highlights exist on the platform in a state of perfect convenience that legacy broadcasters can’t match, especially when it comes to paywalled sports such as cricket and NFL, where watching live requires an immense financial, and time, commitment.However, this convenience and entertainment isn’t without its problems. YouTube’s hyper-personalised algorithm means we’re all watching completely different things. Where previous generations had “Did you watch that thing last night?” as a universal conversation starter, now everyone’s deep in their own algorithmic bubble. We’ve gained infinite choice but lost the sense of shared experience, a shared culture. Even “big” YouTube moments fragment across demographics in ways that Saturday-night telly never did. When politicians – usually, but not exclusively, of the far right – bemoan that we live in a divided nation, they’d be better off pointing the finger at our viewing habits than the immigration figures. My algorithmic delights may well have more in common with a 28-year-old in Bengaluru than the 45-year-old living next door.There is one exception, though it’s not exactly comforting: while YouTube has fragmented viewing habits across most demographics, it’s created something close to a monoculture among young men.Joe Rogan, Theo Von, Lex Fridman and a rotating cast of Trump-adjacent podcasters and public intellectuals, including the late Charlie Kirk, have become a genuinely ubiquitous part of the water-cooler conversation among men my age. YouTube has democratised access to long-form conversation in genuinely enriching ways, but it’s also created pipelines to increasingly toxic content. The platform’s algorithm doesn’t just surface what you’re interested in – it surfaces what keeps you watching, and that’s not always the same thing. It has a tendency to boost extreme viewpoints and fringe theories by taking you on a journey from something entirely harmless to genuinely dangerous misinformation so gradually and organically that you barely notice it happening. And with everyone in your demographic experiencing the same, it’s hard for the community to police itself.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe GuideFree weekly newsletterGet our weekly pop culture email, free in your inbox every FridayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I vividly remember those new-fangled boxes being spoken about often, either dismissively or with delight. A rash of cookbooks followed, and dinner changed across the land. Fast-forward a few decades, and air fryers have become the same kind of kitchen “disruptors”, offering time-saving convenience and healthier cooking, but with the added allure of easily achieved, mouth-watering crispiness.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Since launching with a single-drawer design, air fryers have evolved. Sizes range from compact to XL, while drawer configurations can be double, split or stacked. Alongside air frying, many will grill, roast and bake, and some will dip to lower temperatures for dehydrating, fermenting and proving dough. One we tested features steam cooking, allowing you to whip up dim sum as easily as a roast dinner, while another included racks for cooking on four levels.Given that the air fryer market is so crowded, it’s worth seeking out the best style for your needs – whether that’s for the simple pleasures of homemade chips or to really shake up your meals.At a glanceBest air fryer overall:Tefal Dual Easy Fry XXL EY942BG0£119.99 at AmazonBest budget air fryer:Tower AirX AI Digital Air Fryer£55 at HomebaseBest single-drawer air fryer:Lakeland Slimline air fryer£69.99 at LakelandBest air fryer for chips:Philips 5000 Series NA555/09 dual basket steam air fryer£169 at AmazonBest two-in-one air fryer:Caso Design AirFry DuoChef£129.99 at Caso DesignBest air fryergrill:ProCook air fryer health grill£179 at ProCookBest compact air fryer:Ninja Double Stack XL SL400UK air fryer£188 at AmazonThe best slow cookers for effortless homemade meals, tried and testedRead moreWhy you should trust meWhile air fryers have made the transition from novelty to must-have in recent years, there’s been one in my kitchen for well over a decade, and it’s in daily use. I’ve been a consumer journalist for decades, and as well as air fryers, I’ve tested air-frying health grills and ovens, multi-cookers that can air fry, and everything in between. Anything I can make chips with is welcome in my kitchen. Hang around me long enough and I’ll fill you in on what air fryers can do, how they work, common issues, and how many I’ve tested over the years (about 50).How I testedView image in fullscreen‘My commitment to the cause has seen me peel and chip more than 7kg of potatoes.’Photograph: Rachel Ogden/The GuardianBy now, you must have worked out that I take testing air fryers very seriously. My commitment to the cause has seen me peel and chip more than 7kg of potatoes – which was just as tedious as it sounds. The internet is awash with hacks for peeling potatoes, including everything from worktop gadgets to peeling hot pre-boiled potatoes with your hands – and even (and I’m not making this up) power drills and toilet brushes in a bucket. I decided a sharp peeler was the best choice.Each air fryer was run empty from cold for one hour at 200C to rate its power use. Where available, I followed the manufacturer’s instructions for cooking chips. This is because the guidance is often based on the air fryer’s capabilities. Where there was none, I defaulted to 24 minutes at 200C. The same was true for onion rings – if there was a similar frozen food, I followed the suggested times and temperatures; if not, I chose 18 minutes at 200C.View image in fullscreenFrying tonight: the chips were scrutinised on their colour, crisp and crunch.Photograph: Rachel Ogden/The GuardianAny food that looked at risk of burning was removed before it did so, meaning one or two cycles were ended early. Finished food was assessed on appearance (colour and texture), crisp and crunch, and the consistency of the batch (such as whether some items were less brown than others).The 12 machines I tested for this article are either recognisably an air fryer or an air fryer grill. I haven’t tested compact ovens or multi-cookers that air fry because they don’t offer the same experience, such as the ability to shake or turn the contents quickly, and they often don’t have removable parts that are easy to clean.The best air fryers in 2025View image in fullscreen‘Anything I can make chips with is welcome in my kitchen.’Photograph: Rachel Ogden/The GuardianBest air fryer overall:Tefal Easy Fry Dual XXL EY942BG0TefalEasy Fry Dual XXL EY942BG0from£119.99£119.99 at Tefal£119.99 at AmazonWhat we loveA stellar performance coupled with cooking flexibilityWhat we don’t loveIt’s a bit of a worktop hog, so make some roomPhotograph: Rachel Ogden/The Guardian£119.99 at Tefal£119.99 at AmazonGiven that Tefal is behind the pioneeringActifry, it comes as no surprise that the Easy Fry Dual XXL is a fantastic all-rounder, excelling at both making chips and handling frozen food. It’s also Tefal’s largest double-drawer air fryer, providing a generous capacity for families and entertaining, and it has the company’s 15-yearrepairabilitycommitment to cut waste.Why we love itWhile I remain unconvinced of Tefal’s claim that this air fryer’s 11-litre capacity will cater for eight to 10 people – perhaps if they’re not very hungry – it ticks almost every box, making it my choice for the best air fryer overall. There’s a good temperature range of 40-200C, programs for common foods, and the drawers and plates are dishwasher-safe and feel robust.More importantly, it performed excellently during testing, with the only head-scratcher being its recommendation for chips at 180C for 45 minutes, which was too long. After only 35 minutes, some chips were already slightly overdone, but the overall result was lovely and crisp. Onion rings emerged beautifully browned – they were the best of the lot.It’s a shame that …most buttons are icons – my pet hate – making it a challenge to program without the instructions to hand.Size:38.5 x 45.8cm x 33 (WDH)Capacity:11 litresPower draw:1.154kWh = 30p an hourDishwasher safe:yesPrograms:fries, chicken, vegetables, fish, dessert, dehydration and manualTefalEasy Fry Dual XXL EY942BG0from£119.99£119.99 at Tefal£119.99 at AmazonWhat we loveA stellar performance coupled with cooking flexibilityWhat we don’t loveIt’s a bit of a worktop hog, so make some roomBest budget air fryer:Tower AirX AI Digital Air FryerTowerAirX AI Digital Air Fryerfrom£55£55 at Homebase£79.99 at TowerWhat we loveIts colour screen and presets make it easier to programWhat we don’t loveOutside of the presets, there isn’t much guidanceThe prices below reflect current Black Friday offers£55 at Homebase£79.99 at TowerChoosing a more affordable air fryer doesn’t mean compromising on features. Tower’s AirX comes with an easy-to-read colour screen; a deep drawer with enough flat space for a fish or steak; and six presets that use sensors and a bit of tech to take the guesswork out of cooking different foods.Why we love itRather than being a jack of all trades, this pocket-friendly air fryer specialises in fuss-free lunches and dinners more than general cooking. So if you love marinated chicken wings or a medium steak, this is the air fryer for you. The presets can be constrictive – for example, the fries preset is designed only for frozen chips – but there is a manual mode for more confident cooks.In testing, onion rings emerged perfectly crisp after only 12 minutes, the deep drawer accommodating 11 of them, and fresh chips were near perfect with consistent browning, crunch and bubbling. My only issue was that the touchscreen wasn’t always responsive with a light touch – but this might be a plus for those who dislike oversensitive screens.It’s a shame that …the drawer isn’t dishwasher safe, so some of the time you save with presets will be spent cleaning.Size:22.8 x 39.9 x 28.2cm (WDH)Capacity:5 litresPower draw:0.606kWh = 16p an hourDishwasher safe:noPrograms:chicken, fries, fish, prawns, cupcake, steak, manualTowerAirX AI Digital Air Fryerfrom£55£55 at Homebase£79.99 at TowerWhat we loveIts colour screen and presets make it easier to programWhat we don’t loveOutside of the presets, there isn’t much guidanceBest single-drawer air fryer:Lakeland Slimline air fryerLakelandSlimline air fryerfrom£69.99£69.99 at Lakeland£69.99 at AmazonWhat we loveIt provides plenty of cooking space at a great value priceWhat we don’t loveParts aren’t dishwasher safe, so you’ll have to clean by handPhotograph: Rachel Ogden/The GuardianThe prices below reflect current Black Friday offers£69.99 at Lakeland£69.99 at AmazonIf you don’t have much counter space and don’t want to compromise on capacity, Lakeland’s slimline model is a good choice. There’s adequate flat space inside for family-size meals, or up to 1.3kg of chips, plus an internal light and a clear window to check on dinner.Why we love itI felt this air fryer was great value for money, with a good cooking capacity for its price, and it was economical to run. Its slimline shape meant food could be spread out, and I was pleased with the results of testing. Chips were golden brown, crisp at the ends and fluffy in the middle, and the batch was consistent overall, while onion rings were pleasingly crunchy. I found the window redundant once it became greasy, but it could be useful for less oily foods. I also wasn’t keen on the button that needed to be depressed to open the drawer – but it might keep curious fingers away from harm.It’s a shame that …its lowest temperature is 80C, so you won’t be dehydrating or proving dough.Size:27.7 x 42 x 29cm (WDH)Capacity:8 litresPower draw:0.674kWh = 18p an hourDishwasher safe:no, hand-wash onlyPrograms:fries, seafood, steak, fish, chicken wings, pizza, bakeLakelandSlimline air fryerfrom£69.99£69.99 at Lakeland£69.99 at AmazonWhat we loveIt provides plenty of cooking space at a great value priceWhat we don’t loveParts aren’t dishwasher safe, so you’ll have to clean by handBest air fryer for chips:Philips 5000 Series NA555/09 dual basket steam air fryerPhilips5000 Series NA555/09 dual basket steam air fryerfrom£169£169.99 at Currys£169 at AmazonWhat we loveSteam provides more cooking options than a standard modelWhat we don’t loveIt’s big: not one for those with compact kitchensPhotograph: Rachel Ogden/The GuardianThe prices below reflect current Black Friday offers£169.99 at Currys£169 at AmazonOne of only a few air fryers that can also steam your food, the 5000 Series is particularly suitable if you want to trim fat from your diet – or if you dislike the dry textures that result from overcooking. Introducing steam into the mix means it’s possible to air fry, steam or use a combination of both for moist meats, bakes and reheated leftovers.Why we love itThis double air fryer offers a lot of versatility, and I felt it was the best air fryer for chips. It’s well built, feels robust and is easy to keep clean even without a dishwasher, thanks to the self-clean mode that uses steam to loosen debris. Programming can be puzzling at first – especially as you’ll need to download its manual rather than getting one in the box – but the food it cooked made up for it: crisp, perfectly browned onion rings and chips with a moreish crunch, fluffy interior and pretty consistent browning throughout. It’s frustrating that only the six-litre drawer steams, the three-litre one being limited to air frying, but you’re sure to get plenty of use out of both.It’s a shame that …if you live in a hard-water area, you’ll need to descale this air fryer to keep it in tip-top condition.Size:49 x 39 x 40cm (WDH)Capacity:9 litresPower draw:0.79kWh = 21p an hourDishwasher safe:yesPrograms:fresh fries, frozen fries, chicken, meat, veggies, fish, cake, reheatPhilips5000 Series NA555/09 dual basket steam air fryerfrom£169£169.99 at Currys£169 at AmazonWhat we loveSteam provides more cooking options than a standard modelWhat we don’t loveIt’s big: not one for those with compact kitchensBest two-in-one air fryer:Caso Design AirFry DuoChefCaso DesignAirFry DuoCheffrom£129.99£129.99 at Caso Design£129.99 at AmazonWhat we loveThe ability to become an oven makes it handy for entertainingWhat we don’t loveYou might have to experiment a bit to get the best resultsPrices below reflect current Black Friday offers£129.99 at Caso Design£129.99 at AmazonShort on countertop space? Caso Design’s DuoChef is a twin-drawer air fryer that can turn into a small oven. Think of it like a robot-to-car Transformer: slide out the divider that sits between the two drawers, attach an oven door, and you have another appliance altogether.As well as performing double duty, the DuoChef is packed with handy features. There’s an interior light, windows on each air fryer drawer for checking progress, a shake reminder, and a hold function so that both drawers finish cooking at the same time.Why we love itBeyond its transforming capabilities, the best thing about the DuoChef is how easy it is to program. While some dual-drawer models can leave you scratching your head, here there are just three buttons for selecting the left or right drawer or both.However, while it crisped up onion rings nicely in the allotted time, fresh fries were another matter entirely. After 25 minutes, the potato was still quite pale, with only light browning, and required another five minutes’ cooking time to reach any kind of crispiness.It’s a shame that …it’s pretty slow at whipping up chips compared with the other models on test.Size:43.5 x 38.5x 33.5cm (WDH)Capacity:11 litres (14 litres as an oven)Power draw:0.971kWh = 26p an hourDishwasher safe:yesPrograms:fries, steak, chicken, bacon, fish, vegetables, pizza, cakes, root vegetables, reheatCaso DesignAirFry DuoCheffrom£129.99£129.99 at Caso Design£129.99 at AmazonWhat we loveThe ability to become an oven makes it handy for entertainingWhat we don’t loveYou might have to experiment a bit to get the best resultsBest air fryer grill:ProCook air fryer health grillProCookAir fryer health grill£129£129 at ProCookWhat we loveThe flat space lends itself well to steaks, fish and kebabsWhat we don’t loveLots of accessories = more stuff to storePhotograph: Rachel Ogden/The GuardianThe price below reflects current Black Friday offers£129 at ProCookIf you find the flat cooking space of some air fryers restrictive, you can spread your (chicken) wings with ProCook’s air fryer health grill. It comes with a 4.5-litre cooking pot and basket for air frying, as well as accessories to turn it into a slow-cooking and steaming kitchen helper.Why we love itAir fryer grills aren’t always the most convenient for making chips from scratch, because you can’t quickly shake a drawer for even results. However, with the toss of a spatula, the ProCook ensured great consistency throughout its batch of chips. They emerged crisp at the ends and golden overall, with no pieces that overcooked and only one or two paler chips. Onion rings were crunchy and nothing stuck to the basket. My only niggle was that the settings could be confusing for a first-time user: once you’ve altered them to suit and hit start, the display shows the program’s default settings instead while it preheats.It’s a shame that …I found cleaning the basket and cooking pot a chore: it comes with its own brush for tackling greasy residue, and you will need to use it.Size:40 x 40 x 28cm (WDH)Capacity:4.5 litresPower draw:0.83kWh = 22p an hourDishwasher safe:no (basket and pot)Programs:air fry, roast, broil, bake, dehydrate, slow cook, grill, griddle, stew, steam, keep warm, manualProCookAir fryer health grill£129£129 at ProCookWhat we loveThe flat space lends itself well to steaks, fish and kebabsWhat we don’t loveLots of accessories = more stuff to storeBest compact air fryer:Ninja Double Stack XL SL400UK air fryerNinjaDouble Stack XL SL400UK air fryerfrom£188£188 at Ninja£188 at AmazonWhat we loveThere’s great capacity in a compact footprintWhat we don’t loveIt could be too tall to tuck it below units when not in usePhotograph: Rachel Ogden/The GuardianPrices below reflect current Black Friday offers£188 at Ninja£188 at AmazonNo article about air fryers would be complete without Ninja, which has given the world models in all shapes and sizes – most notably its stacked designs. The Double Stack XL offers capacity without a huge worktop footprint, thanks to its twin 4.75-litre drawers and a pair of racks that double its flat area, allowing you to cook four layers of food. Ideal for families, newbies and those struggling to squeeze in an air fryer.Why we love itNinja’s air fryers always come packed with guidance and recipes, and the Double Stack XL is no exception. These serve to underline how versatile it is: you could cook two whole chickens at the same time, for example – great if your barbecue’s rained off. It’s incredibly easy to program and adjust as it cooks – and the top temperature of 240C is perfect for crisping food from the freezer. That said, some of its recommended times and temperatures might be a bit off. After 26 minutes at 200C, some chips were still pale and soft, which suggests they’d need longer. There were similar results from the onion rings, which after 18 minutes didn’t have the crisp and crunch produced by the other machines.It’s a shame that …its results didn’t impress me as much as Ninja’s other air fryers have – you may need to tweak settings.Size:28 x 47 x 38.5cm (WDH)Capacity:9.5 litresPower draw:1.049kWh = 28p an hourDishwasher safe:yes – but hand-washing recommended to extend lifespanPrograms:air fry, max crisp, roast, bake, dehydrate, reheatNinjaDouble Stack XL SL400UK air fryerfrom£188£188 at Ninja£188 at AmazonWhat we loveThere’s great capacity in a compact footprintWhat we don’t loveIt could be too tall to tuck it below units when not in useThe best of the restView image in fullscreenThe Instant Pot Vortex Plus ClearCook VersaZone, Tower Vortx Colour, Salter Fuzion and Russell Hobbs SatisFry multi-cooker.Photograph: Rachel Ogden/The GuardianFritaire the self-cleaning glass bowl air fryerFritaireThe self-cleaning glass bowl air fryerfrom£152.15£154 at B&Q£152.15 at AmazonWhat we loveIt’s seriously stylish and looks fab lit upWhat we don’t loveIt’s not nearly as convenient as a standard modelPrices below reflect current Black Friday offers£154 at B&Q£179 (£152.15 for Prime members) at AmazonBest for:avoiding nonstick coatingsHate the boxy look of air fryers? Or perhaps you crave crispy chips but have doubts about BPA, Teflon or Pfas? If so, there’s the Fritaire. Equipped with a stainless-steel grill stand, rotating tumbler for fries and a rotisserie for chicken, it looks as if a halogen cooker and an air fryer got together and had a baby. Plus, there’s a choice of bright colours for those who can’t stand black.There’s much here to like – a “self-cleaning” function that keeps the glass bowl from becoming greasy, good visibility to check progress, and if you’re using the tumbler, no need to shake fries – but there are downsides. I found the display hard to read in bright light, and the tumbler capacity is only 500g: loading it with chips was awkward compared with tossing them in a drawer. Plus, while onion rings emerged crisp and brown from the stand, the chips were anything but. While the batch was consistent, the chips were mostly soft and slightly chewy.It didn’t make the final cut because …the exterior grows extremely hot during cooking, and stays hot for some time after.Size:34 x 26 x 33cm (WDH)Capacity:4.7 litres (0.5kg max capacity of food using stand/tumbler)Power draw:0.65kWh = 17p an hourDishwasher safe:yes, accessories onlyPrograms:frenchfries, steak, chicken, seafood, bake, dehydrateFritaireThe self-cleaning glass bowl air fryerfrom£152.15£154 at B&Q£152.15 at AmazonWhat we loveIt’s seriously stylish and looks fab lit upWhat we don’t loveIt’s not nearly as convenient as a standard modelSalter Fuzion dual air fryerSalterFuzion dual air fryer£99£99 at AsdaWhat we loveLots of capacity and cooking flexibility for the priceWhat we don’t loveYou might need to test and adjust for the best resultsPhotograph: Rachel Ogden/The Guardian£99 at AsdaBest for:families on a budgetIf you’re feeding many mouths, you’ll need a big air fryer. Salter’s Fuzion offers a lot of space at an affordable price – and thanks to the eight-litre drawer’s divider, you can air fry two foods at the same time. Alternatively, with the divider in place, you can just use half the air fryer: perfect for snacks. However, like other air fryers with dividers, it has issues with shaking: both types of food will be tossed around, and larger drawers are harder to shake.I was disappointed with the level of browning on the chips and found that the onion rings weren’t quite as crisp as they should be. Keeping its clear window grease-free may be a challenge, too.It didn’t make the final cut because …the drawer doesn’t feel as durable as it should be for this type of air fryer: its metal is thin enough to flex.Size:36.4 x 38 x 32cm (WDH);capacity:8 litres;power draw:0.912kWh = 24p an hour;dishwasher safe:no;programs:manual, chips, shellfish, steak, pork, bake, chicken, vegetablesSalterFuzion dual air fryer£99£99 at AsdaWhat we loveLots of capacity and cooking flexibility for the priceWhat we don’t loveYou might need to test and adjust for the best resultsInstant Pot Vortex Plus ClearCook VersaZone air fryerInstant PotVortex Plus ClearCook VersaZone air fryerfrom£85.49£139 at John Lewis£85.49 at AmazonWhat we loveIt’s great at turning out crisp and crunchWhat we don’t loveProgramming an air fryer should be easier than thisPhotograph: Rachel Ogden/The GuardianThe prices below reflect current Black Friday offers£139 at John Lewis£85.49 at AmazonBest for:confident air fryer cooksI’m afraid Instant Pot commits one of my air fryer cardinal sins with its Vortex Plus VersaZone: there’s no instructions or guidance in the box, but simply a QR code that directs you to videos – I’m not a fan of forcing tech into the kitchen. The Instant Pot was also one of the trickiest to program (for example, you have to switch from single drawer to dual by holding its control knob), so it’s probably not a good choice for air fryer newbies.There are some good things here, though: two 4.2-litre compartments with a divider, the ability to switch to fahrenheit, and the option to turn off the beeps if they annoy. It also produced great results, and perhaps that’s the most important thing: plenty of crispy chips – though not consistently so – and crunchy, well-browned onion rings.It didn’t make the final cut because …the display is busy and hard to read in bright light.Size:31.4 x 38.4 x 40.4cm (WDH); capacity:8.5 litres;power draw:1.187kWh = 31p an hour;dishwasher safe:yes;programs:air fry, roast, bake, grill, dehydrate, reheatInstant PotVortex Plus ClearCook VersaZone air fryerfrom£85.49£139 at John Lewis£85.49 at AmazonWhat we loveIt’s great at turning out crisp and crunchWhat we don’t loveProgramming an air fryer should be easier than thisRussell Hobbs SatisFry air fryer & grill multi-cookerRussell HobbsSatisFry air fryer & grill multi-cookerfrom£82.99£119.99 at Argos£82.99 at AmazonWhat we loveThe pot is dishwasher safe – a rarity for an affordable applianceWhat we don’t loveYou might need to air fry in batchesPhotograph: Rachel Ogden/The Guardian£119.99 at Argos£82.99 at AmazonBest for:small householdsIf you’re unsure about how much you might use an air fryer and so want an appliance that does more to earn its place on the worktop, the compact SatisFry could suit. It may stretch the definition of a multi-cooker somewhat, lacking some of the functions you might associate with one, but its spacious pot can be used for air frying and other tasks, including slow cooking and searing.There’s not much guidance, however, and the results were mixed: chips were browned but soft and not very crisp, while onion rings were doughy with some singeing. I suspect both could have benefited from different times and temperatures. The other downside is that it recommends no more than 800g at a time for air frying, so you won’t be able to use all its space for this function.It didn’t make the final cut because …it’s not the easiest to program: for example, there are no separate up and down buttons for time and temperature.Size:37.8 x 32 x 28.2cm (WDH);capacity:5.5 litres;power draw:0.550kWh = 14p an hour;dishwasher safe:yes;programs:air fry,bake, grill, keep warm, roast, sear, slow cook high/lowRussell HobbsSatisFry air fryer & grill multi-cookerfrom£82.99£119.99 at Argos£82.99 at AmazonWhat we loveThe pot is dishwasher safe – a rarity for an affordable applianceWhat we don’t loveYou might need to air fry in batchesWhat you need to knowView image in fullscreenYour air fryer should be able to cook almost anything your oven can.Photograph: Grace Cary/Getty ImagesWhat can I cook in an air fryer?While air fryers have gained a reputation for turning out perfect homemade chips and crispy food from the freezer, they’re capable of far more. Not only can you “boil” eggs, prove dough and make yoghurt (if your model offers lower temperatures), you should be able to cook almost anything your oven can. As a rough guide, for oven recipes, set your air fryer temperature 20C lower (so if a recipe states 200C fan, set your air fryer to 180C). Air fryers also cook more quickly than an oven. The time can be reduced by as much as a quarter, so check food often to prevent burning.You can press your air fryer into service for every meal of the day.

Busy day? Curl up withair fryer chicken wings with baby potatoesfor a tasty supper or a sweet treat snack ofglazed chouxnuts.What features should my air fryer have?A good-quality air fryer is an investment, so check its programs, ease of cleaning and temperature/time range before you buy. There’s no need for the lower temperatures and long durations (usually up to 12 hours) for dehydrating fruit and fermenting yoghurt if you’ll mostly be using it for air frying, for example. Similarly, if you’re a keen cook, look for one with plenty of space – a small air fryer may soon limit your horizons.For those with a dishwasher, check that drawers and crisping plates are safe to clean this way, while if you’re cleaning by hand, robust nonstick coatings will make degreasing easier.The best kettles to save energy and speed up your cuppa, testedRead moreHow do air fryers work?Air fryers are best thought of as smaller, modified convection ovens with a fast fan. Rather than having the fan and element at the rear, these are above, producing powerful fanned heat that’s circulated around the drawer.Food sits on a perforated crisper plate, allowing heat to reach the underside, while a thin layer of oil on the surface “fries” the exterior to create browning and crunch. Shaking the contents in the drawer roughens up the surface, creating more area for crisping.Are air fryers healthier than regular frying?Yes, both because you need a lower amount of oil – a tablespoon should be enough to coat a 500g batch of chipped potato, while other foods require no oil at all – but also because the way food is “fried” is different.Conventional frying uses the oil in the pan to seal the exterior. This prevents moisture from escaping, which is then heated, steaming the inside. To do this, oil penetrates the food’s surface, meaning that more fat is retained than when air frying.Are air fryers ‘toxic’?Linger on social media long enough and you’ll find worries about air fryer toxicity. It’s usually centred on plastic parts growing hot (which, as it’s limited to the exterior of air fryers, rather than the parts that come into contact with food, shouldn’t present a problem) and nonstick coatings containing Pfas/PFOA.Most manufacturers have phased out PFOA (since 2013, all Teflon products have been PFOA-free), while potential deterioration of nonstick (which may use Pfas as this is a term for a large group of chemicals) tends to happen attemperatures of 260C and above. Most air fryers have a limit of 200C, with the top temperatures on others 240C.If you’re concerned about the safety of nonstick, choose an air fryer with a ceramic-coated pan and plates, or clean yours carefully: damaged coatings are more likely to release chemicals.Another concern linked to air fryers is about cooking starchy food, which produces acrylamide (a potential carcinogen). However, the same risks apply when oven-cooking food.Cooking oil at high temperatures can also produce potentially harmful compounds. Air fryers don’t use much oil, but if you’re concerned about this, choose an oil with a high smoke point (the temperature at which oil starts to smoke and break down), such as vegetable, peanut, sunflower or rapeseed.Do air fryers use less energy than an oven?Air fryers have gained a reputation for being economical, and while this is true for the most part, it won’t always be the case. For small amounts of food, air fryers use less energy, heating up quickly and only circulating hot air within a small space. An example, a A+-rated 72-litre oven might use 1.395kWh to cook a roast chicken over 90 minutes, while an air fryer could do the same job in less than an hour and use only 0.782kWh – almost half the energy and cost.However, if you were cooking large amounts, such as a whole roast dinner – chicken, roast potatoes, yorkshire pudding, roast veggies and so on – running several cycles of air frying would cost more, making an oven the more energy-efficient choice.The best rice cookers for gloriously fluffy grains at home: nine tried and tested favouritesRead moreRachel Ogden has worked as a consumer journalist for decades, becoming an expert unboxer before it was a thing, although she is much less successful at repacking.

As with everything the man does, the effect was disastrous and totally inappropriate. But rewatching the video, I saw from the president less an example of his usual bigotry and more an attempt at what looked like “OK, kiddo” cuteness that, catastrophically, and before I could nip it in the bud, had triggered a tiny sprig of sympathy.It didn’t last two seconds, obviously. The day after his piggy remarks, the US president sat in the Oval Office alongside the Middle East-based tyrant Mohammed bin Salman and sucked up to him for all he was worth. There was nothing affectionate in Trump’s response to Mary Bruce, the chief Whitehouse correspondent for ABC News and hero of the hour, when she asked the Saudi crown prince about the murder of Jamal Khashoggi – which, she suggested bravely, US intelligence agencies had concluded “you orchestrated” – then informed the Saudi leader that “9/11 families are furious that you’re here in the Oval Office”, and rounded it off with: “Is it appropriate, Mr President, for your family to be doing business in Saudi Arabia while you’re president?” (According to Forbes magazine, Trump’s extended family put through $50m in business deals connected to Saudi Arabia in 2024 alone.)Trump’s explosive rage was well under way before she’d even finished speaking, and the same thing struck one about his language as it always does: that the babyish register of calling someone a “terrible person and a terrible reporter” is more unnerving – more sinister in a booky wook Clockwork Orange kind of a way – than someone who speaks like a functioning adult.TuesdayFor a long time, Vanity Fair mattered and its annual Hollywood Issue was a big deal to those who remember it. Those people may be amused by the decision by its new editor, Mark Guiducci, to feature an all-male line up of actors this year, subverting the usual form and joining the awkward what-about-men lobby group keen to claim underdog status for that half of the population that still makes 19 cents more on the dollar than the other half. (In Britain, the gender pay gap is still going strong, too.)Guiducci presented Glen Powell, Michael B Jordan and Andrew Garfield among others under the exhortation: “Let’s hear it for the boys!” Hard to think of a less enticing invitation, except perhaps one to join related discourse around the “state of masculinity” ignited by David Szalay’s Booker win this month, which has flushed out those pluckytruth-tellers who believemale journeys aren’t celebrated and that women dominate publishing to the detriment of male writers.The fact that, in the past 15 years, twice as many men as women have won the Booker, or that, like teaching, one reason salaries in publishing are so low is because it has historically been a field popular with women, does not, of course, get in their way.View image in fullscreenRFK Jr: so powerfully alluring to Olivia Nuzzi that she blew up her life for him.Composite: AP, AFP via Getty ImagesWednesdayLife isn’t long enough to dwell too much on the troubled journey of Olivia Nuzzi, the former reporter for New York magazine who was fired after what, unfortunately, must be described as a “sexting scandal” with RFK Jr – a man she had profiled for the magazine. I did, however, find myself pausing to read two related pieces this week: a longblog postby Ryan Lizza, Nuzzi’s ex-finance who was also fired – from the New Yorker in 2017 – in which his anger is so fresh it rises from the screen like mist, and the companion profile of Nuzzi in the New York Times.Nuzzi, of course, has a book out – American Canto – and in Jacob Bernstein’s New York Timesprofileof her, I laughed out loud at the reporter’s absolutely noble effort to elevate a story of hideous people doing regrettable things to a state-of-the-nation piece.Bernstein writes: “‘American Canto’ is far more about bearing witness to Trumpworld and about how she believes that warped her, just as it warped the country.” Yes, the centre was not holding, it was a country of bankruptcy notices and public-auction announcements and commonplace reports of casual killings, and a 32-year-old publicity seeker who found a strong candidate for America’s least attractive man so powerfully alluring that she blew up her life for him.“The book, which comes out Dec 2, paints a picture of a nation and a personal life on fire,” writes Bernstein, to which one can only rejoinder: bravo!ThursdayAnd still the endless slide to the bottom goes on for the former Duchess of York, Sarah Ferguson. Her new children’s book was supposed to be published today, postponed from October while the Epstein scandal played out and presumably in the hope that everyone would have forgotten about her involvement by now. Sadly for Ferguson, this has not been the case and this week the book and the publicity tour were cancelled.As this paper reported, Flora and Fern: Kindness Along the Way is a book about “two rabbits learning ‘kindness and community’ during an adventure in the big city” – a lovely message we will never get to enjoy, along with the book’s sequel, in which Flora encounters a billionaire financier who offers to train her as a masseuse, while using a dumb, sex-addicted minor royal as bait, and learns kindness and community along the way.FridayLet’s cleanse ourselves with this: the publication of a novel that took 30 years to write, is in seven parts and unfolds over the course of a single day. The heptalogy On the Calculation of Volume is not, thankfully, by Karl Ove Knausgård, but by Solvej Balle, a Danish woman who against all commercial odds has watched her 30-year endeavour become a publishing sensation, culminating this year in an inclusion on the International Booker shortlist and along profile this weekin the New York Times. As the reporter noted after spending time with Balle on the remote Danish island where she lives, and in a phrase that falls like a balm after brushing up against Nuzzi, Ferguson et al: “She seemed happy not to have won the Booker prize.”Explore more on these topicsUK newsDigested weekDonald TrumpWomenNewspaperscommentShareReuse this content"

AI rips our creativity awayDave SchillingAI-generated songs are topping Spotify charts. This isn’t about the ‘democratization’ of art – it’s about scaleFri 21 Nov 2025 06.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 21 Nov 2025 12.00 ESTShareMaking music is hard. Well, at least it used to be. I remember the old days, when you had to spend hours and hours honing skills, coming up with something clever or personal to say, then actually recording sounds that people would want to listen to. But that’s the past. In our sparkling future, a pre-teen can dump a bunch of words into a machine and out comes a catchy tune. In 2025, a robot can be a pop star. (AlthoughData from Star Trek did drop an albumback in the 90s. How soon we all forget.)Three AI-generated songs recentlytopped Spotify’s “Viral 50” charts. One of the “creators” responsible for these songs, Broken Veteran, who squirted out a track about immigration policies, told the Guardian that AI is “just another tool for expression, particularly valuable for people like me who have something to say but lack traditional musical training”. It used to be that if you didn’t know how to do something, you wouldn’t do it.I’ll never be Shohei Ohtani – I’m simply not handsome enough – but what if I could buy a robot to hit home runs for me? Could I then call myself a baseball player? Probably not, since I literally would have accomplished absolutely nothing, even if the robot wore a jersey with my name on it.Advocates for AI art always throw the word “democratization” around, claiming that these machine tools remove the barriers for entry to creativity. Those barriers were actually pretty valuable, because they prevented people from having to suffer through things that are objectively bad. But again, that’s the old way of thinking. The concept of “bad” or “good” hardly exists any more. In its place, we have a goopy stew of garbage with a few nuggets of actual sustenance periodically bubbling up to the surface.Thousands of AI songs are uploaded to the internet every day, by people who aren’t actual musicians. I struggle to see how that’s a good thing. Why would I wantmore music? I don’t have time to listen to the music that exists now. There are over100m songs on Spotify. What is the point of that? Why do we need to add more on to that Hometown Buffet of music? Did the world really need an AI song calledI Caught My Knackers in the Cutlery Drawer? The answer doesn’t matter, because it’s there anyway. It’s like whenApple forced us all to download that U2 album, but times a million. (And to be fair, I would rather listen to I Caught My Knackers in the Cutlery Drawer – I’d take a robot over Bono most days.)At the core of all this artificially generated misery is the big, scary S-word: scale. Corporations, especially ones in media and entertainment, prize size over curation. More widgets – songs, TV shows, movies, books – means more monetization opportunities. More clicks, more watch time, more engagement. It doesn’t matter how it happens or why. Streaming video services prize theamount of time something is viewed. Whether or not a person finishes the show or movie is almost irrelevant, as long as they are spending more time on the platform. As Netflix said in a recent corporate statement, “Engagement (ie time spent) is our best proxy for member joy.” Only on the internet does time spent equal joy. If I take an hour and a half to build an Ikea dresser, does that mean I’m experiencing joy? The two minutes and forty seconds I spent listening to the AI songThat Fart Woke Me Upin a bid to understand the AI-music phenomenon was not pleasurable in any way, but algorithms and data do not care about such things. Happiness can’t actually be quantified, even if a Rotten Tomatoes score for a movie makes one think so.And that is the real tragedy of all this AI slop and obsession with scale. Human experience is made secondary to chunky bits of code or esoteric values on a spreadsheet. One of the chart-topping songsbelieved to be AI,Walk My Walk, by a mysterious entity known as Breaking Rust, is a middling country song about self-expression and perseverance in the face of doubters. Not an uncommon topic for a song when generated by an actual human. The irony here is that the song about believing in yourself is apparently made by a computer. When you gives your artistic voice over to a machine, you invite a mediator into that expression. Something else is literally doing the talking for you. You are not saying anything. The machine is, based on what you have asked it to create. When someone uses AI to write a thank you email or a personal essay, they are abdicating their responsibility to articulate honestly.Technology used to be seen as an instrument for our creativity. A pencil made it easier to record our thoughts. A typewriter and a personal computer did the same, increasing our ability to say what we felt or wanted. Now, technology is actively interrupting our dreams. Artificial intelligence is not a tool for creativity, it’s a wet nurse who burps little babies and feeds them mashed peas every few hours. If I don’t have to spend time learning how to write or make music, then what do I even do with my creative life? I suppose I could spend more time engaging with content. I could devote my remaining days on this Earth to listening to all 100m songs onSpotify. Doesn’t that sound completely dreadful?Dave Schilling is a Los Angeles-based writer and humoristExplore more on these topicsMusicOpinionArtificial intelligence (AI)SpotifycommentShareReuse this content"

How does one build those into a political system?Fri 21 Nov 2025 13.05 ESTLast modified on Fri 21 Nov 2025 19.23 ESTShareIt feels as though a collective amnesia has set in around Covid-19. We all just want to move forward and pretend it didn’t happen. But, as the saying goes, those who don’t learn from history are doomed to repeat it.On 20 April 2020I tweeted, “At what point will the British public realise what has happened over the past 9 weeks?” On Thursday, theCovid inquirypublished itsmodule 2 reporton the political response to the pandemic. The answer finally to my tweet, more than five years later.Already back then it seemed that the UK government (through its late and chaotic response) had taken the worst path, leading totens of thousands of deathsand a draconian lockdown. The inquiry report states clearly what many could see at the time. Had it followed a containment path similar to the best performing countries, such as South Korea, Denmark, Norway and New Zealand, England could have avoided multiple lockdowns and arguably the majority of deaths in 2020. From January 2020, other countries wereshowing the waythrough early action and strong public health systems based on test, trace and isolation.The report confirms that we had a distracted and absent prime minister in Boris Johnson, badly advised and working within adysfunctional No 10. Not surprising, then, that devolved administrations didn’t trust the prime minister. In defiance of logic, we were all told to stay at home and not to travel beyond a certain distance, whileairports remained openwith no checks on passengers coming in. It was like trying to empty a bathtub with the tap still on. Nonsensical.Move forward to summer 2020 and the UK government, led by Rishi Sunak as chancellor and without consultation with scientists or devolved governments,triggered a second wavewith his “eat out to help out” scheme, which incentivised people to go into venues where there was a high risk of transmission and infection. Baffling. Food to be collected or taken away (which would have also supported struggling hospitality businesses) wasn’t part of the scheme.For full disclosure, I was asked to givewritten and oral evidenceto this module of the inquiry. From February 2020 onwards, my team at the University of Edinburgh repurposed a major grant from the Wellcome Trust to work on Covid. Using international datafrom governments and academics, my view was that we needed to suppress the virus to the lowest possible level and go after clusters as soon as they emerged until a vaccine was approved and rolled out.Genomic researchshows that Scotland did manage to extinguish the first strains of the virus before they were reimported in summer 2020 through travel. Again, there isno point draining the bathtub if the tap stays open. But this is all old news.The Covid story has a relatively happy ending: vaccines saved us from a disastrous future and delinked cases and hospitalisations, bringing the death rate from Covid below that of seasonal flu. The heroes of the Covid story are science and the NHS (and immigration, as evenJohnson attested to, given the international healthcare team who treated him for severe Covid in hospital).Reflecting on the report, I can’t help but wonder what it adds to our understanding of what happened politically, and what lessons it offers for the future. It’s an eye-wateringly expensive undertaking: it has alreadycost almost £200m, and Scotland is having its own ongoing inquiry at acost of £45m. Most of these costs are for the legal teams. Compare this with all the independent scientists on expert advisory groups who worked pro bono for hundreds of hours over two years. I can’t see anything in the module 2 report that hasn’t already been covered in published books, articles and analysis about what happened and why.From a scientific perspective, the report could never hope to provide one off-the-shelf plan for responding to every pathogen with pandemic potential. The response to one virus won’t work for another and each isdependent on the characteristicsof the specific outbreak. What we really need for our politicians to respond effectively to the next potential pandemic are agile leadership, smart decision-making, flexibility, humility and trustworthiness.

But how does one learn lessons from this in a democracy that lets people vote for the party they want to lead the country? Surely it’s about voting in competence over entertainment. Voting in those who are detail-oriented, thorough and hardworking. I think ofJacinda Ardernas an example of someone with these qualities – and why New Zealand fared so well during the pandemic.I hold out more hope for theinquiry reporton government procurement when it is released. The more shocking story of the pandemic was thecorruption enabledby Conservative government ministers. Analysis by theNew York Timesof 1,200 government contracts worth nearly $22bn during the pandemic found that almost half went to companies run by friends and associates of Conservative party politicians, or those with no experience in the area.Jolyon Maugham highlightedthe “vast financial rewards you could reap if you had a minister looking out for your interests”. His Good Law Project estimates thatmore than £4 in every £5spent on PPE was wasted or lost.Some people see suffering and want to help. Some see the same situation and think easy money. What the inquiry could do is recommend legislation that safeguards the system and taxpayers’ pounds against profiteering in a crisis. This has to be done now, in a time of “peace”. We need strict rules so that even when certain greedy types think a disaster is a chance to get rich off the public dime, and politicians are willing to enable it, the law prevents it from happening.I can’t help but think ofMichelle Mone, who has become the face of this hidden group of pandemic profiteers. Why don’t we call legislation to protect taxpayers’ money – and improve trust in our politicians and government – the Dame Michelle Mone Law? That would be a great recommendation to come from the next part of the inquiry.Prof Devi Sridhar is chair of global public health at the University of EdinburghFit Forever: Wellness for midlife and beyondOn Wednesday 28 January 2026, join Annie Kelly, Devi Sridhar, Joel Snape and Mariella Frostrup, as they discuss how to enjoy longer and healthier lives, with expert advice and practical tips.Book ticketshereor atguardian.liveDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The carpets are soaked, the walls damp. It’s always cold, no matter how much they turn up the heating.The family try everything. They promise to replace the sodden carpets and find new, innovative ways to warm the house. Someone with a laptop wonders if AI might be the answer. But no one ever looks upwards and says: maybe we should just repair the giant hole in the roof.Britons are that family – and the giant hole in the roof isBrexit.On Wednesday, Rachel Reeves will deliver her second budget, on which, it is widely assumed, the fate of an ailing Labour government depends. Recent weeks have brought conflicting signals – a rise in income tax rates floated,only to be reversed– but there is one big thing we already know: the country does not have enough money to pay for all that it needs and wants.Every public service you can name is desperate for more cash. Take, almost at random, Britain’s prisons: overcrowded, understaffed and saddled with boxes of paper records, a system so “archaic”, according to the prisons minister, that as many asthree inmates are mistakenly released each week. It’s the same story everywhere, from the NHS to the armed forces: we need more money than we’ve got.Reeves will scrabble around to find a few billion, but none of those efforts will address the fundamental problem, which is that we are poorer than we should be, poorer than we were and poorer than our peers.People are right to ask ‘what is the point of Labour?’ when it can’t agree on anything | Martin KettleRead moreReal wages havebarely risen in 17 years. Of course, the crash of 2008 was a global phenomenon, but we are struggling more than our counterparts to recover: indeed, for nearly two decades, Britain has experiencedthe biggest slowdown in productivity growth in the G7. Reeves and Keir Starmer could see the problem when they arrived in office last year, which is why they made growth their paramount objective. But in Britain that is proving stubbornly difficult to achieve, no matter who is in Downing Street.Of course it is: there’s a great big hole in the roof. This week, the economists John Springford and Andrew Sissons publisheda detailed analysisexamining the roots of the trouble. The UK’s woes, they explain, stem from having too few internationally successful industries: “It means many places have too few well-paid jobs and too little income coming in.”And why might that be? “Since Brexit, [Britain] has beenactively undermining its [own] economic model, which is founded on openness to trade, ideas and people.”Openness is the heart of the matter. Britain flourishes when it is open and trading, and shrivels when it is not. Brexit ignored that core economic reality – a defining fact about these islands – by making the UK less open to trade in goods, taking us out of a single market in which Britain had been in its element, trading freely and without friction to hundreds of millions of consumers. Naturally, and wholly predictably, “Britain has fallen behind peer countries since it lost access”, write Springford and Sissons, with the fall in goods exportsdraining more than one percentage pointfrom GDP each year.The picture is better in services, but even there, for long stretches of the Brexit era, the UK haslagged behind Germany, France, Spain and Italy. Where once we might have relied onthe money machine of the Cityto plug the gap left by a declining goods trade, the finance sector has also been hit, losing its once disproportionately large slice of the market. Frankfurt, Dublin, Amsterdam, Madrid, Milan and Paris have all gained, as London has fallen behind. Incredibly, the capital, once the UK productivity engine that helped the rest of the country make ends meet, is now Britain’s worst-performing region in terms of productivity growth. Given Brexit stripped the City of the easy access to EU clients it once enjoyed, that’s hardly a surprise.Of course, the decision-makers know all this. Last month, the governor of the Bank of England warned Brexit would have a negative impact on the UK economy for the “foreseeable future”. Previously, the Office for Budget Responsibility estimated that our departure from the EU would shrink Britain’slong-term productivity by about 4%.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Instead, Labour has made only tentative steps in that direction. The much-vauntedtrade deal agreed with the EUis forecast to yield £9bn by 2040. Better than nothing, but for an economy whose value is measured in the trillions, it’s small change.No, if Britain wants to remedy the ailment that has made it the sick man outsideEurope, it needs to be bolder. Rejoin the single market for goods, urge Springford and Sessions. It’s not as if we want to regulate goods much differently anyway, so any sacrifice of supposed sovereignty is negligible.If that medicine seems too strong, then why not re-enter the customs union? Being on the outside is estimated to be costing us up to£30bn a year, the kind of money that could really come in handy. Admittedly, Labour’s manifesto ruled out such a move, but Reeves was seemingly ready to break her pledge on tax rates – and a U-turn on the customs union would cause a fraction of the political damage. Besides, it could be embedded in a larger argument: that given the straitened times, and the threat posed by Donald Trump’s tariff attack on the global trading system, it is a necessity born of a radically altered situation.The point is, tinkering won’t cut it.Seasoned Europe-watchers explainthat EU officials, many of them shaped by years of attritional Brexit talks, respond to timid, footling proposals from the UK in kind. But if Britain were to be more ambitious, seeking a genuine and bigger reset – putting “more cards on the tableto build political momentum”, as former foreign secretary David Miliband put it this week – then heads of government are more likely to push the Brussels bureaucrats aside and get stuck in, forging with Britain a new deal that could be much more profitable for everyone involved.Again, it is a case that could be made forcefully and that much of the British public would accept – that the world of 2026 is entirely different from 2016, that the old red lines no longer make sense and that Brexit was a waste of money that, now more than ever, we simply cannot afford.I don’t expect Reeves to say any of those things, but she should. Charged with stewardship of the public finances, she needs to point to the obvious source of so much of our trouble.

But what happened to talking up the value of migrants for a thriving economy and society?Fri 21 Nov 2025 11.55 ESTLast modified on Fri 21 Nov 2025 12.05 ESTShareThis is howLabourMPs see it. They face brutal dilemmas and miserable choices. How to manage our asylum system is one of the worst. Through their constituency work, they will have met refugees with tragic stories of war and fear, of terrifying journeys across the world, of gangsters on night-time beaches. But MPs’ experience of hearing those heart-rending stories clash head-on with what they see as political necessity, demanding they block their ears and harden their hearts. A life in politics is not for the squeamish.Wes Streeting, a practising Christian, yesterday writhed whileanswering questions on LBC radioabout the home secretary’s tough plans for deterring small boat arrivals. The flavour of his reply reflected how many on Labour’s benches feel. Confronted with the government’s intention todeport more families with children– ending whatShabana Mahmood saidwas feeble “hesitancy” – he sought a bogus escape by claiming many would leave voluntarily, making forced removals “low”. But when pushed, he said yes, removals must be enforced. Was he comfortable with that? “Honestly? Comfortable? No. But is it the right thing to do for the country? Yes.”The dilemmas are deep, morally and electorally. They affect MPs from “red wall” seats whose vote is being swallowed by Reform; MPs in seats with large ethnic minority populations who are losing to independents; and those in university seats where votes vanish leftwards. All of them have different anxieties about immigration – but all can read the polls. The polling group More in Common finds not just the wider public, but amajority of Labour and Green voters –yes Labour and Green– support much of the government’sDanish-style ruthlessness. “In both language and substance, Shabana Mahmood is much more in line with the median Brit than either the Labour left or Reform,” says Luke Tryl, director of More in Common.His polling finds that on the harshest items, a majority of both Labour and Green voters back these plans: prioritising sending asylum seekers home rather than integrating them in the UK; requiring financial guarantees before bringing in family. A majority of Labour voters, and more Green supporters than not, also support giving refugees only a temporary right to stay; only allowing permanent residency if they speak good English and have a full-time job; and only granting asylum to those personally targeted by a regime, not just fleeing wars. There are59 active, state-based conflictsaround the world, more than at any time since the second world war.All of this shows why, although Labour MPs may hate facing up to it, any rebellion against the home secretary’s measures is unlikely to be seismic. Expect the government to moderate the cruellest proposals but stick to the rest. The new plan would send refugees home when the regime they fled has fallen, though their homelands may never be as safe as Europe. Only 6.6% of the world populationlives under a full democracy. The bill also proposes toextend the waitbefore refugees can qualify for indefinite leave to remain or settled status.While Mahmood’s legislation will pass, Labour should have thought more seriously about how to launch a policy designed to appease this dark strand in the national psyche.Leaving large numbers of migrants in limbo in the UK will hinder social integration, almost undermining the concept of refugee status. People have very different views of asylum seekers awaiting a verdict on the one hand, and migrants beckoned here with visas on the other. But what most people also feel about the positives of immigration went missing this week.The underlying assumption, as in most of this government’s policies, is that public opinion is fixed: the hard right may successfully sway it, but Labour never dares try. Yet if it’s politically necessary to deter small boat arrivals, it’s just as essential to talk up the value of welcoming migrants for a thriving economy and every aspect of society. Mahmood, the daughter of Pakistani immigrants, may be its personification, but this needs repeating daily, to refute racist claims. Of all the apparent foreigners the haters spit at, only a tiny fraction are refugees or asylum seekers. A much larger numberwho come every year areeconomic migrants, because employers need their skills. Keep saying it.The OBR calculates that the higher the rate of net migration,the more GDP will rise. Arrivals on the skilled worker route make anet household fiscal contributionof £12,000, according to the latest figures fromthe government’s migration advisory committee. Employment rates of working age non-UK nationalsare slightly higherthan UK nationals, with EU nationals higher still.A fifth of the NHS workforce in England is made up ofnon-UK nationals, including over a third of doctors in hospital and community services. The RCNwarned on Thursdaythat 46,000 foreign nurses may leave the UK due to the proposed changes to indefinite leave to remain: the rest of the world will welcome them. Yet there are still 111,000 care vacanciesin England alone.Cash-strapped universitiesdepend heavilyon international students for almost a quarter of their income – £12bn per year. International studentsboost export earningsby around £23bn. Key scientistschased out of US universitiesby Trump need a rapid welcome.Because stopping the boats is almost impossible, the impact of these new Home Office deterrents is uncertain. Where are the battalions of skilled processors to check every migrant’s status every two years for 10 or 20 years? Deportations need an agreed, Europe-wide system. The risk is that cutting “net” numbers is easiest by restricting work and study visas, yetonly 4% supportfewer students or workers coming to Britain, according to a poll by British Future. In a long list of occupations, from academics and engineers to care workers, fruit-pickers and caterers, a majority don’t want any particular occupational group cut. People, quite reasonably, want control.Labour points to Denmark’s successin deterring arrivals. What bitter irony that on Wednesday, Denmark’s Social Democrats lost control of Copenhagen to the left, with those tough migration rules partly to blame.Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsImmigration and asylumOpinionLabourMigrationRefugeesShabana MahmoodHome OfficecommentShareReuse this content"

But these are the risks we must addressFri 21 Nov 2025 09.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 21 Nov 2025 18.49 ESTShareThe idea of serving the public has been baked into the bones of journalism ever since the profession was created.Whether it was quality information to inform the citizenry, or sensationalism and gossip, newsrooms and editors have had the desires and needs of their audiences, noble and ignoble, front of mind.But this relationship is changing in important and dangerous ways – the latest change in 50 years of technology-driven disruption to our media and public life.Let me explain.If you use a search engine such as Google, you will have noticed that in recent times when you ask for information on a topic you are served a neat precis of the main facts at the head of the search results. There are links for further information if you want it, but most people are content with the summary.Becoming an AI-detective is a job I never wanted and wish I could quit | Samantha FloreaniRead moreThe summary is written by artificial intelligence – by robots – which comb the work of humans, including the work of journalists, to compose the key points.That means that fewer people are clicking through to news media outlets in search of the news. So far the trend is small, but everyone expects it to increase. And that undermines media business models. Fewer eyeballs on a media organisation’s website or app means fewer subscribers and fewer advertisers willing to pay to reach the diminishing audience.Let’s leave aside, for the moment, the issue of accuracy of the robot-generated summaries, because most of them are accurate enough. The bloopers are embarrassingly bad, sometimes dangerous, but also increasingly rare.This is because the AI companies – Google, OpenAI and the rest – are signing deals with media companies that allow them to use content written by journalists, including decades of media archives, to train and feed their robots.Most of the big media companies have signed some kind of deal, and it is easy to understand why. Media business models have been repeatedly strained, even broken, by successive waves of technological change.The money on offer for licensing content to the AI companies is almost irresistible. When everyone is doing it, who dares to hang back?Ethical media companies hedge their agreements with caveats designed to give them some control, and to protect their reputations.But that can obscure the underlying mechanism – a breach in the relationship between journalists and their audiences. A transfer of power from media brands to AI brands and their owners.Artificial intelligence is so new, and its development so fast, that only fools would make predictions with confidence. Perhaps there is a bubble, andperhaps it will burst. Perhaps within months a different model will have emerged.But I fear that if the current trends continue, media organisations may quite rapidly move from a business-to-public model, to a business-to-business model.The AI companies will intervene between journalist and audience.It is so much easier to outsource the functionality to big tech, which thus increases its dominance and controlToday22% of Australians pay for news, according to the University of Canberra’s annual digital news report.That suggests some brand loyalty. But 22% is obviously not even close to a majority. Once most households bought a newspaper. Now, quality commercial media is no longer a “mass” business. It is a service for an elite.Those who don’t pay get their information from free-to-air television (still important, but declining fast), social media (still growing) or the many free outlets including influencers, podcasters and political partisans. Some peopleavoid the news altogether. In this country, we can be grateful that free outlets include the public broadcasters, which are widely trusted and hold themselves to standards of accuracy and impartiality.Now more than ever, quality news media brands depend on their relationships with audiences for relevance and financial survival. And yet, in the deals with AI companies, they may be trading away the very things on which that relationship depends.Does it matter if journalists are researching and writing content for use by AI businesses, rather than as a direct service to the public?It very much does.These are the risks.First, most obviously, if the journalism doesn’t serve the interests of the people who control AI, then content may not be published, or may be distorted or suppressed. We already see that happening insome of the search results served up by Elon Musk’s Grok.Second, we lose one of the main benefits of accessing a media site’s webpage, app or channel. You learn about the things you didn’t think to ask about, curated into a package by humans exercising judgment.An AI-dominated model, on the other hand, responds only to questions about specific topics, or what it divines about you from your previous searches. It does not care about you as a fellow citizen.What AI doesn’t know: we could be creating a global ‘knowledge collapse’ | Deepak Varuvel DennisonRead moreThird, if media companies lose a direct relationship with their audiences, they will become more vulnerable to attack. How likely is it that the public would know or care about, let alone rally to defend, a media organisation that had annoyed the government, if the information it had produced was consumed mainly as part of a mashup of multiple sources?And would the sense of public duty and public purpose, which still motivates the best newsrooms and journalists, survive if the direct relationship with audiences was severed or weakened?There is no point pretending that change is not happening, or that it can be avoided. But the risks need to be addressed.Media organisations need to get into the game, protecting their brand by delivering high-quality content. They need to make that content, including their archives, easier to search. They should offer subscribers their own in-house question-and-answer robots. This is already happening in many media organisations, but probably not fast enough.It is so much easier, when budgets are strained, to outsource the functionality to big tech, which thus increases its dominance and control.Perhaps the world’s public broadcasters could collaborate to build their own AI engines, trained on factchecked material, and remaining in public hands.Or perhaps the audience will grow dissatisfied with the mashups and the impersonal voice.Perhaps people will value, and pay for, the original, the textured, the in-depth. The interviews and the observation and the bearing of witness that forms the heart of journalism.We should hope so.The relationship between journalist and audience is key to trust, to robustness, to the ability to bring attention to uncomfortable issues and unwelcome news.It is crucial to the idea of the public, and the public interest.We lose it at our peril.Margaret Simons is an award-winning freelance journalist and author.

Where the demand is coming fromMorwenna FerrierA new brand flogging face masks for four-year-olds is disturbing, but it’s worth asking why children are asking for these products in the first placeFri 21 Nov 2025 06.01 ESTLast modified on Fri 21 Nov 2025 12.23 ESTShareAs a newish mother, I am only too aware of the myriad ways we have failed our children. And then I came across a new skincare company aimed at four-year-olds. It’searly days for Rini, whose sole product is now a Korean-made hydrating facial mask. A healing ointment and daily barrier cream are allegedly in the works, too. If you were under any illusions as to the mask’s purpose, it is infused with vitamin B12 – which, according to various skincare sites, improves elasticity and skin texture – with a clear peel-on application process modelled online, Patrick Bateman-style, by a preschooler.On the one hand, I appreciate that children put all sorts on their faces – face paint, stickers, poo, toothpaste, kitchen cleaner, a sibling’s blood, and that’s just in this last week alone – and that their faces will occasionally need to be cleaned. And while it’s entirely plausible that some parents will be moved watching their child dip their delicate toes into the world of Korean beauty, I’m marginally more concerned by the strains of strep and croup doing the rounds at my two-year-old’s childcare (I am also worried about my six-year-old’s health, but if this company is anything to go by, he’s probably beyond help).And yet. Despite the shock I feel about beauty products being aimed at a market whose disposable income is wholly dependent on teeth loss, is anyone really surprised?For context, these Rini kids come hot on the heels of Sephora kids, “a catch-all phrase for the intense attachment between preteen children, high-end beauty stores and the expensive, sometimes harsh, products that are sold within them”according to an investigationby my colleague Hannah Marriott. Sephora kids are marginally older but significantly more online, and yet both phenomena attest to the fact that in 2025, no age range remains untapped by capitalism.Children do not need skincare. But for the most part, nor do we, and I say that as someone trapped in a never-ending doom loop of cleaning and creaming of my own making. But just as capitalism has taught us to conflate desire with need, more pressingly, demand for this stuff seems to be coming from the kids themselves.Allow Instagram content?This article includes content provided byInstagram.

Becoming a parent pushes you into a difficult, rewarding but lifelong contract to see to your child’s wellbeing. So what if your child wants some moisturiser? Sometimes you have to say no to the proverbial ice-cream.Yet however much you limit their screen time – these older kids are gawping at the same TikTok tutorials as their parents – if primary school-age children are demanding face masks, it’s worth engaging with the root cause. Because as staggered as I am that it’s legal to market a face mask to four-year-olds, it’s not the product that’s the issue. A face mask lined with honey and dew would be equally offensive – and possibly more effective. This trend’s most disturbing aspect is the drive, capitulation and promise that line the slippery and unregulated slope of an industry that puts profit above anything else.I don’t really want to lay the blame on parents, just as I don’t think I should be moisturising in a locked room in case my youngest walks in on me mid-act.If these children are aping the language and mindset of adults – or indeed Sephora siblings, if they have them – it was ever thus. Children will always act out adult rituals as long as they’re witness to them. She didn’t buy me lipstick or smoke, but I borrowed my mother’s and sucked on candy cigarettes. My children have play kitchens and dolls, but also water pistols and play swords. Are face masks any more than a logical conclusion to a childhood of role play?Plus, there is an argument that forearmed is forewarned. I have bought younger family members a pint on the basis that it’s better the devil you drink with, and that adulting with highly controlled variables – the Fisher-Price version – is safer than the alternative.“I do not support young kids using inappropriate skincare, and we don’t want to be setting up kids for years of feeling self-conscious about their skin, but young girls do play dress up,” consultant dermatologist Dr Alexis Granitetells me. She has also seen tweens and teens with skin that has reacted to using inappropriate creams.And yet playing beauty feels different, perhaps because it is. The products are aimed almost entirely at girls and, like most beauty, rooted (unconsciously or not) in attracting a mate, ergo sex, at least implicitly. As Granite says, “it’s another form of play, but with more emotional charge built into it.”In the same way that culture demands that women tackle the ambient terror of ageing head on while also mocking the process, there is a baseline hope that predatory consumer capitalism shouldn’t be able to get you until you have the means to participate. While I live in terror of thinking what I might actually look like minus the creams, serums and God knows what else (probably much the same), the idea that this “journey” would have begun in earnest before I had a handle on phonics makes me want to cry.Driven by impossible standards, society decrees that just as women want to look younger, teens want to look older and so, it seems, do four-year-olds. As Miranda July’s narrator in All Fours writes, “so much of what I had thought of as femininity was really just youth.” It’s just the beauty industry’s prerogative to grease those wheels.Morwenna Ferrier is the Guardian’s fashion and lifestyle editorExplore more on these topicsChildrenOpinionParents and parentingSkincareBeautyFamilycommentShareReuse this content"

What’s the truth?Fri 21 Nov 2025 03.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 21 Nov 2025 12.04 ESTShareIbegan by trying to discover whether or not a widespread belief was true. In doing so, I tripped across something even bigger: an index of the world’s indifference. I already knew that by burning fossil fuels, gorging onmeat and dairy, and failing to make even simple changes, the rich world imposes a massive burden of disaster, displacement and death on people whose responsibility for the climate crisis is minimal. What I’ve now stumbled into is the vast black hole of our ignorance about these impacts.What I wanted to discover was whether it’s true that nine times as many of the world’s people die of cold than of heat. Thefigure is often usedby people who want to delay climate action: if we do nothing, some maintain, fewer will die. Of course, they gloss over all the other impacts of climate breakdown: the storms, floods, droughts, fires, crop failures, disease and sea level rise. But is this claim, at least, correct?The figure comes from a study using thewidest available datasetsto try to produce a global view. The results are, to say the least, surprising. For example, it suggests that even in the hottest parts of the world, more people die of cold than from heat. In fact, sub-Saharan Africa appears to have the world’shighestrate of deathsfrom cold and the world’slowestrate of deaths from heat. The figures suggest that 58 times as many people there die of cold than of heat. While it’s true that in hot places people areless adapted to cold, can this really be so?The paper explains that its dataset “covers 750 locations in 43 countries or territories”. But the only African country covered is South Africa. Nor are there any data from India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Afghanistan, the Gulf states (except Kuwait), Indonesia or Melanesia. In other words, most of the world’s hottest countries are not represented. Nor are most of the places in which healthcare is weakest, either for the population as a whole (as in some African nations) or for the most vulnerable people (as in the Gulf states, where citizens might be well covered, butmigrant workersscarcely at all). This is in no way the fault of the authors – it’s simply a matter of where records are available.The study had to model global trends from places in which data exist, which tend to be richer, cooler countries, where health systems are relatively strong. There’s nothing I can see that’s wrong with the methodology: it’s just that the records are so patchy. As one of the authors, Prof Antonio Gasparrini, told me, their extrapolation “was moderate in some areas, but more extreme in others … in some cases the degree of extrapolation (especially geographical) was huge, and we cannot rule out that the model works less well in some regions”. They are currently trying to improve it. A subject that we, as the main agents of chaos, have a moral obligation to understandlooks on the maplike an enormous hole with a few ragged edges.A paper published in 2020 points out that in large parts of Africa, there isno recordeven of extreme heat events, though they certainly happen. Heat events mean major temperature anomalies, in which large numbers of people could be expected to die. The crucial international disaster database EM-DAT records only two heatwaves in sub-Saharan Africa between 1900 and 2019. They were deemed to have caused the deaths of 71 people. The same database lists “83 heatwaves in Europe between 1980 and 2019, resulting in over 140,000 deaths”.Even the extreme African heatwave of 1991-1992 was not reported in the EM-DAT database. Given that people inAfricatend, as the paper remarks, to have “higher levels of vulnerability and exposure” than people in Europe, is it really credible that fewer die of heat on that continent than on any other?Far from the improvement in data we might expect, there has been a rapid and catastrophicdecline in the number of weather stationsmeasuring conditions across Africa. There are now blocks hundreds of miles wide in whichnot a single stationis recorded. As the climate scientist Tufa Dinkupoints out: “Coverage tends to be worse in rural areas, exactly where livelihoods may be most vulnerable to climate variability and climate change.”This is to say nothing of weatherradarstations, which observe and forecast weather patterns and are essential for early warnings. In the US and Europe, where 1.1 billion people live, there are 565 weather stations, while in Africa, where 1.5 billion live,there are 33, according to the World Meteorological Association. Without weather warnings, many more people die.As for heat deaths, the epidemiologist Prof Kristie Ebipoints outthat even in the US the official estimate, of about 1,200 a year, “is probably at least a tenfold undercount”. The great majority are recorded as heart attacks, kidney failure or other conditions. But epidemiological data show how deaths spike during heatwaves. Heaven knows how much underreporting there may be in countries with much sparser records.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It reminds me of the statement the US defence secretaryDonald Rumsfeld madeduring the 2003 Iraq war, that came to stand for the Bush administration’s bloody insouciance: “We don’t do body counts on other people.”How can vulnerable nations be compensated for the “loss and damage” caused by climate breakdown if we haven’t the faintest idea how great that loss and damage might be? So far, rich countries havepledged just $788.8mto the UN’s fund. That’s 44 US cents for each of the 1.8 billion citizens in the Climate Vulnerable Forum nations: the sum total of our “compensation” for the disruption, disaster and death we have caused.The Cop30 summit could be represented as a vast shrug ofrich-world indifference: we neither know nor care, so why should we confront our populations with the need for change, with all the political difficulty that involves?

It’s the reasons why those motherhood-and-apple-pie values don’t always prevail in real life, rather than the values themselves, that are generally too contentious for the carefully apolitical royals. Yet what were once safe, bland nothings are increasingly no longer so – and not just because of the awkward shadow now cast over any royal initiative involving childhood by the former prince Andrew’sinfamous associationwith the sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein.There was something strangely jarring about listening to a princess talk earnestly about the need of children to be surrounded by “love, safety and rhythm” in the same week that Lord Alf Dubs, himself a former child refugee,was denouncinga Labour home secretary’s proposal to remove financial support from families with children whose asylum claims have failed, and ultimately to round up and deport them. (Shabana Mahmood had argued that successive governments’ longstanding nervousness about subjecting families to the same rules as lone asylum seekers risked creating a “perverse incentive” to bring small children across the Channel.)The contrast won’t have been remotely intended, of course – Catherine is careful to avoid political controversy – yet it is uncomfortable to watch the wife of a hereditary monarch-to-be appealing to a nation’s best instincts while a democratically elected government feels compelled to chase our worst. Unlike Mahmood, princesses don’t have to worry about re-election. But something is wrong with a country where politicians seem frightened of talking about compassion or human connection for fear of being howled down; where only queens in waiting have the luxury of sounding as if they actually have a heart.As William moves to Forest Lodge, an era of pushbike royals beckons. Will that save the monarchy? | Simon JenkinsRead moreHow does an institution whose function is to bring a country together function in one that seems increasingly hellbent on tearing itself apart? The Waleses employ more than enough old Westminster hands, including expert policy advisers from the David Cameron, Tony Blair and Boris Johnson eras, to help them stay the right side of the old party lines. They’ve already learned the art of engaging with genuine public disquiet without pushing for specific policy changes – as the princess did recently by highlighting the way smartphones arechanging family life, and as Prince William’s pilot project on showing that it’spossible to end homelessnessis designed to do – even when what they’re talking about are problems you might reasonably expect governments to tackle.“You skirt around edges and see where you can help,” as the then Prince Charlesonce saidof his own approach, whether that meant lobbying a visibly irritated Blair government againstgenetically modified cropsor running the Prince’s Trust with its then unfashionable focus on youth unemployment all through the Thatcher years. (Memorably,Norman Tebbit once snipedthat maybe the prince felt such empathy with the jobless because he didn’t have a proper job either.) The challenge for the king and his increasingly involved heir apparent now, however, is that the royals’ concept of socially useful but generally unobjectionable work was drawn up in a world where some ideas – that the climate crisis is a threat from which the planet urgently needs saving, say, or thatracism has no place in modern society– were a matter of boringly settled consensus. And that world seems to be slipping away.If Reform UK wins the next election, Charles may well end up reading out a king’s speech containing pledges to scrap net zero that we would all know contravened everything he has ever stood for, and immigration policies harsher than the Rwanda scheme he was reportedly overhearddescribing behind closed doorsas “appalling”. While British royals are well used to granting assent through privately gritted teeth to legislation they don’t actually like, what the current generation faces may be a more profound clash of values. Even the otherwise inscrutable late queen couldn’t quite restrain herself fromsticking a public oarin when she felt the integrity of the nation was at stake, during the 2014 referendum on Scottish independence.The new head of both church and state could easily find himself caught in the crossfire between senior clergy who are increasingly vocal in their criticism of Reform’s approach to immigration – “isolationist, short term and kneejerk”, as the archbishop of York put it this summer – and a government with a popular mandate for it; or between his commitment to defending all faiths, Islam very much included, and a prime minister in Nigel Farage who apparently believes that a growing number of young Muslims don’t share British values. And in the event of a constitutional crisis – whether precipitated by a general election result delivering a hung parliament with no majority for any one party, or by something an iconoclastic Reform government tried to do in office – the royals could very quickly find themselves in the public hot seat. If the palace isn’t working through what it would mean to reign but not to rule in such a charged situation, then it should be. Or we may all be in for quitesome annus horribilis.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Let’s remind ourselves of its horrorsGiles TremlettLittle is taught about the murderous, incompetent dictatorship – and now almost one in five young people say Franco was good for the countryFri 21 Nov 2025 00.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 21 Nov 2025 11.52 ESTShareAt first sight, few suspected that Francisco Franco might become a strongman capable of imposing a brutal dictatorship across four decades. He was a short, squeaky voiced army officer with a shaky grasp on non-military matters and zero charisma. Yet he did exactly that, before dying of natural causes in a Madrid hospital,50 years agothis week.Even today, Franco serves as a warning that outward mediocrity is no barrier to the ruthlessly ambitious. Behind the dull facade lay a slippery, clever operator. Franco’s ambition was underpinned by an iron will, a glib indifference to violence and unbounded self-esteem.His admirers and defenders – including some on the newly buoyant far right inSpain, the US and the UK – still claim Franco was never really a dictator, but rather a beloved saviour from communism. They are wrong, but dictators do not emerge from nowhere.“Some important part of every society consists of people who actively want tyranny,” French political theorist Jean-François Revel observed the year after Franco’s death: “either to exercise it themselves or – much more mysteriously – to submit to it.” Franco believed the same: what people really wanted was to see and feel themselves governed, he said.Of course, if Franco had been genuinely popular, there would have been no need for his 1936 military insurrection against an elected leftwing government, or for the half a million dead of the ensuing Spanish civil war. Nor would he have shot20,000 peopleafterwards.Franco grabbed power in a Spain still slumped in post-imperial ennui – a mighty empire having disappeared the previous century. Franco wanted to make Spain great again. He blamed foreigners. They were either stealing Spain’s money, conspiring against it as part of a Marxist-Jewish-masonic plot, or poisoning Spanish minds with foreign ideas: liberal democracy, socialism, communism, and his bizarre bugbear, Freemasonry.His war was deliberately slow and violent behind the lines, accompanied by a bloody purging of opponents in an attempt to “purify” this contaminated Spain. His new Spain also had to be a place of supposedly “virile” men and subservient women, whose rights to their bodies, children, work and property were cut, shelved, or handed over to husbands and fathers.After a vengeful victory, Franco locked Spain into a corset of self-reliance and threw away the key. Autarky was embraced. Foreign capital and goods were shunned. “We have everything we need,” he said.But he was wrong. The immediate result was famine, with people dying on city streets in 1940 and 1945. As he drove on a victory tour through the towns of Jaén and Málaga, people begged at his car window. “Señor Franco, for God’s sake, a piece of bread,” they said. Even Nazi officials in Spain, his allies, complained that a grandiose facade hid the ghastly truth. By backing Hitler and Mussolini during the second world war, Franco turned Spain into a pariah state, but he refused to step aside afterwards. Spaniards sank further into misery.Franco’s conviction that he was both divinely chosen and always right meant he demanded a lifelong term in charge. A British ambassador complained that he lived in a “heavy mist of self-complacency”, blind to his own incompetence. Luck, and a lack of any definable ideology, came to Franco’s rescue. When the cold war started, he burnished his anti-communist credentials and the US rehabilitated him.As a result, a disastrous economy was eventually rescued and forced toopen upby the US and the International Monetary Fund. In the 1960s, Spain was swept into a southern European economic boom that had started long before in Italy and Portugal. Suddenly, tourists were pouring on to Spanish beaches at Benidorm or on the Costa del Sol. Many Spaniards still could not find work, but the money they sent home after emigrating to northern Europe also helped.Franco quietly dropped his most stupid ideas – from founding a new empire to making synthetic gasoline with a “magic” formula – but never abandoned his central aim of making Spaniards tame, obedient and politically apathetic. He invested massively in state terror from the 1936 coup onwards, deployed a strict, Goebbels-inspired press law, and ensured that generations of Spaniards were schooled in a heavily conservative and historically amnesiacFrancoist curriculum. As late as the 1970s, independent political parties, free and fair elections and trade unions remained banned.Franco also infantilised Spaniards, deeming them incapable of governing themselves. The scariest part of his legacy was that so many believed him.When that fear-driven consensus finally began to fall apart during the last decade of his rule, he defaulted back to violent domination. Trigger-happy police, torture, firing squads and even that medieval form of execution, the garrote, reappeared. The latter saw a metal collar placed around a condemned person’s neck and tightened until it snapped their spine or cut off their air supply; it was being used by a western European government on its own citizens,in 1974.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

After all, what happens after the man at the centre of a decades-long dictatorship dies? Power was initially passed to the young king Juan Carlos, who oversaw three years of reforms that ended with a referendum on the democratic constitution that still holds today. Spain remains a vibrant, disputatious democracy.Heroic narratives emerged to explain this. For the left, it was the result of pressure from brave street protesters, students and workers who fought continually with riot police. For the right, it was a sign of establishment wisdom. For Francoists, in the most twisted version of all, it forms part of the dictator’s legacy.And therein lies a problem. At the Madrid copy shop where I printed out drafts of my recent book on the dictator, El Generalisimo, the owner kept insisting that his father claimed to have lived well under Franco. His father remembered, of course, only the economic boom of the 1960s.While promoting the Spanish edition of the book, I have also realised that theproblems describedby María Ramírez about growing up surrounded by silence about the dictatorship are still with us. University students tell me that their high school teachers were still skirting around the subject just a year or two ago. As a father of young Spaniards, that is a huge worry.Ignorance is dangerous. It is not surprising that almost one in five young peoplebelieve his dictatorship was goodfor Spain. The only way to change that is to break the silence and teach young Spaniards what Francoism was really about.Giles Tremlett is the author ofEl GeneralisimoandGhosts of SpainExplore more on these topicsFrancisco FrancoOpinionSpainThe far rightHistory booksPoliticsEuropecommentShareReuse this content"

One restless night, an idea comes to you. You work it up in your studio and send it off to the foundry, to be cast in bronze. Finally, you’re ready to show it to the world, but the first person through the gallery doors barely glances at it before taking a selfie with it. What do you do? Bear in mind that you are Tony Cragg, Royal Academician, and you are on record bemoaning the preference of many art-lovers for listening to audio guides as they tour exhibitions.The perhaps unlikely answer is that you welcome the selfie-taker with outstretched arms, or at least give a convincing impression of doing so. “No, I don’t have problem with that,” says Cragg, albeit faintly, as if he’s thinking about the people who might be crossing the threshold of his latest show, which just opened in London. “People are bound to respond in different ways.”My father thought sculpture was a very dull and unnecessary activityLiverpool-born Cragg, in a zip-up sweater and dark trousers, is a lean 76-year-old but could pass for 20 years younger. He has lived for many years in Wuppertal, Germany, exhibiting and teaching across the continent and collecting many honours to add to his 1988 Turner gong. He has had his own decided views and gone his own way since he told his father he wanted to be an artist as a teenager. “He said, ‘What a waste of time and education!’ My father was bitterly disappointed. He was an electrical engineer and worked on aircraft and thought sculpture was a very dull and unnecessary activity.”Cragg’s problem with audio guides is that they get in the way of a spectator’s relationship with an artwork. “If you have a picture on a wall,” he says, “it doesn’t matter what the artist’s intention was. A hundred people stand in front of it and they will tell you a hundred different things about it. The person comes with their education, background and abilities – and responds to what’s in front of them. People interjecting all the time disturbs that direct dialogue with the artwork.”View image in fullscreenCragg’s work at Lisson Gallery.Photograph: George Darrell/© Tony Cragg, Courtesy Lisson GalleryTechnological distractions aside, Cragg is pleased to be back in London. “I’ve lived abroad for the main part of my life, but I still feel very British. When I come back to Britain, immediately I’m more relaxed. I love British humour. I love the weather. I love the food. I feel like I’m back home, anyway.” He still supports Liverpool FC and rues their recent form. “Someone once told me, as an artist you’re only as good as your last show, and in football you’re only as good as your last game.”Cragg’s recent works include tall, free-standing forms that might gesture towards buckled or twisted skeletons. We are speaking just before his show opens and, as I watch them being wrestled into place, I think about artists on the road – musicians, say – and how much easier it is for the percussionist playing the triangle than the cellist. Of course, Cragg now has his own roadies. “I have a fantastic team,” he says. “They do everything. I arrived yesterday, moved things around for an hour, then left.” You don’t take your art on the plane with you then? “I used to,” he laughs.When I was growing up, the French were ‘Frogs’ and the Germans were ‘Krauts’Cragg’s early work included pieces that explicitly addressed issues in the land of his birth, including Riot, a frieze produced in the aftermath of the miners’ strike in 1984 and clashes between police and youths in Brixton, London. “I left Britain in 1977 at the beginning of the Thatcher period, and the destruction of the arts schools here, and a lot of other developments. It was a very extreme form of capitalism that paid no regard to the needs of the wider population.”He has also used the motifs of the crown jewels and the union flag. What did he make of seeing the flag on lamp-posts during protests in the UK this summer? “Well, it’s very difficult to live abroad and then be critical about how people live in another situation. But the most bitter disappointment I had initially was Brexit. This idea of isolationism, stepping back – I think it’s bad for the general population. It’s sad. And then you feel tendencies which are very nationalistic.“When I was growing up, the French were ‘Frogs’ and the Germans were ‘Krauts’. My parents were very unhappy that I went to Germany because of the war. But thanks to the Royal College, I went to France to work for a year and I realised, ‘Hey, the food’s not bad here!’ I noticed the furniture and the way the French treated their families: wow! But everybody has a history. My children, who are German, have this terrible burden of their history on their shoulders, from their grandparents’ generation.”Although he didn’t see eye to eye with his father about sculpture, Cragg considers it a waste of time to make busts of the famous, or the likeness of a horse. “For me, representing exactly what’s in front of you is a senseless activity, a vain attempt by humans to parody or copy nature.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toArt WeeklyFree weekly newsletterYour weekly art world round-up, sketching out all the biggest stories, scandals and exhibitionsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But, he feels, the time for figurative sculptors to lay down their chisels is long overdue. Artists such as Auguste Rodin incorporated the ideas of Sigmund Freud into their work, says Cragg, and Marcel Duchamp, who took a urinal and called it art, introduced the readymade. “When I was student, we realised that readymades were kind of running out of steam, but then people like Damien Hirst took it to another dimension with a shark in a tank.”Cragg’s first job was in a laboratory and he’s all for children studying Stem subjects, but says that without art lessons they’ll struggle to visualise what they’re learning. “Art is one of the best ways for people to have a better existence. It makes life more livable. To ignore that, in a way that has happened in Britain, is almost criminal.”He still loves what he does, saying: “I hate holidays. Twenty-five years ago, everybody needed a holiday. I spend a lot of time in Scandinavia so we found somewhere we can spend the summer in a very beautiful place where there’s the ocean and nature – and a studio! That’s perfect for me, it’s my dream.”He shows me a list of new ideas on his phone and reads some out. “First and Second, Recall, For a While, Long-stop, On and off, Way to Go, Path, Backtrack … I’m not telling you these are future sculptures or anything. They are just things that tick through in the time I wake up.”Was that a month’s worth of ideas? “I hate to say it, but that was last night.”Cragg is astonished by the popularity of contemporary art, unimaginable when he was starting out. “Now, everywhere you go has its own gallery. I live within an hour of 40 galleries showing contemporary art. But in Britain, there used to be just London. In France, only Paris. When I was in France, the arts bodies were trying to take modern art out into the countryside – but the people threw food at it!”Tony Cragg’s sculptures are at Lisson Gallery, London, until 31 JanuaryExplore more on these topicsArt and designSculptureArtfeaturesShareReuse this content"

In 1964 they turned down a role in Elvis’s Viva Las Vegas for fear of being pigeonholed in American musical comedies.Instead, it was in continental Europe that the duo truly left a mark on culture – in their native Germany but especially so in Italy, where they broke the mould of acceptable mainstream TV entertainment and paved the way for a new generation of empowered female performers.View image in fullscreenThe twins in Erik the Conqueror (AKA Fury of the Vikings), directed by Mario Bava, 1961.Photograph: Everett/ShutterstockBorn in 1936 in Saxony, Alice and Ellen Kessler joined the Leipzig Opera children’s ballet two years after the end of the second world war and were due to move straight on to the attached dance school. But after escaping through the iron curtain to join their father in Düsseldorf in 1952, their breakthrough came in West Germany instead. They acted in a string of popular musical comedies, and in 1955 they were discovered by the director of the Lido cabaret theatre in Paris and became part ofMargaret Kelly’s Bluebell Girls. They represented West Germany at Eurovision in 1959, an experience they later calledeinmisserfolg(“a flop”) – their entry, Heute abend woll’n wir tanzen geh’n, (Tonight We Want to Go Dancing) placed 8th out of 12.It was their move to Italy in the early 1960s that turned them into true showbiz icons. They made their debut on Italian TV in the variety show Giardino d’Inverno (Winter Garden) in 1961, which evolved into Studio Uno the same year. For Studio Uno, they danced and sang the opening theme tunes, most notablyDa-da-un-pa, a typical show tune with a fun-and-fancy nonsense chorus. Upon seeing them, screenwriter and playwright Ennio Flaiano chauvinistically described them as “two pairs of legs and one head”.View image in fullscreenThey broke the mould … performing on German TV in 2004.Photograph: Snapshot photography/T Seeliger/ShutterstockBut beneath the glitz was serious craftswomanship. French cabaret, Austro-German operetta, their ballet training and Broadway all influenced their act assoubrettes– the French word used by Italians to indicate women who could sing, dance, and banter with equal confidence.The emphasis was always on their foot- and legwork, and in culturally conservative 1960s Italy, showing exposed legs was still deemed scandalous to the point that they had to have them covered with thick, opaque tights. Inhis obituaryfor Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera, journalist, author and TV history scholar Aldo Cazzullo noted that it was only after a couple of years’ worth of performances that the Kesslers were allowed to wear nylon tights.View image in fullscreenChe gambe! … the twins make their London debut at the Savoy Hotel in 1971.Photograph: Jack Kay/Getty ImagesThis, in turn, provided commercial opportunities: hosiery titan Omsa promptly hired them for commercials in which they were joined by impish choreographer Don Lurio, in a segment aptly titled “Che gambe!” (“What legs!”). Their other big Studio Uno hit, 1965’s La notte è piccola, confidently affirmed their right to have fun: “The night is too short for us,” they sang. “There’s little time to dance and sing”.While they did fewer variety performances in the 1970s, they posed in the nude, at the age of 39, for the January 1975 Playboy Italia issue, which achieved the 1975 equivalent of virality, outselling any previous issue. Their combination of song, dance and non-vulgar sensuality proved immensely influential for the leading showgirls of the 1970s and 80s, serving as the blueprint for Raffaella Carrà, the biggest and most enduring star to emerge from Italy’s variety show culture. Carrà bared her midriff like the twins had shown their legs; her hits Ma che musica and Felicità tà tàfeel like spiritual successors of Da-da-un-pa and La notte è piccola; and the twins appeared to symbolically pass the baton to the next generation when they appeared as guests on an April 1974 episode of variety show Milleluci hosted by Carrà and vocal powerhouse Mina. In one segment,the four women sangabout an aspect of their performance and their physiques that most appealed to male viewers. As Italian TV historian Rachel Haworth writes in her bookThe Many Meanings of Mina, this moment seemed to be both a product of the male gaze and a sly subversion, “as the women use their bodies to illustrate their objectification”.View image in fullscreenThe twins in Germany in 1997.Photograph: Karl Mittenzwei/APAlice and Ellen remained inseparable even after they retired from show business. In the early 1960s, clad in top hats, shimmery bodices, they had sungWir wollen niemals auseinandergeh’n(“we never want to be apart”), a 1959 schlager by Heidi Brühl. The original is an operetta-like waltz and a proclamation of endless romantic love, but the twins’ swing-like take emphasised their sisterly and artistic bond: “Wir wollen immer zueinandersteh’n / Mag auf der grossen Welt auch noch soviel gescheh’n”. “We always want to stand side-by-side / Whatever happens in the big wide world”.In a 2024 interview they gave to the Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera, they stated: “Our desire is to leave this world together, on the same day – the idea of one of us going first is very hard to bear.”Explore more on these topicsPop and rockDanceTelevisionEntertainment TVEurovisionAssisted dyingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

All the signs are pointing that wayBen ChildWill Quaritch, the square-jawed representative of military-industrial destruction befriend the Na’vi in James Cameron’s forthcoming Avatar: Fire and Ash? And if so, what other unlikely character about-turns should we be prepared for?Fri 21 Nov 2025 09.43 ESTLast modified on Fri 21 Nov 2025 13.58 ESTShareIt’s almost possible to feel a little sorry for Colonel Miles Quaritch, the main villain of Avatar. Imagine: first you’re sent light years from Earth to hang out with 14ft blue space hippies, then you’re suddenly dead. Then you’re resurrected as one of the 14ft blue space hippies. And now, according toJames Cameron, you might just be starting to realise that the giant tree-hugging freaks you’ve spent two films trying to erase are your kind of people after all.Speaking to Empire inan interview last week,Cameron revealed that the Quaritch we will meet in the forthcoming Avatar: Fire and Ash (although still played by Stephen Lang) is no longer the same person we first saw stomping through the rainforest in the original 2009 film. Yes, he’s a “recombinant” – a lab-grown Na’vi reboot of a man carved out of granite and patriotism – but he’s also going through a full-blown existential wobble after discovering in the last instalment that he has a human son, Spider. “Quaritch is undergoing an identity crisis,” said Cameron. “His interest in the biological son of his biological precursor form is all about trying to define, ‘Am I a completely new person? Am I bound by the rules and the behaviours of the person whose memories and personality I was imprinted with?’ It’s a true existential dilemma for him in the philosophical sense.”Cameron also asked: “At what point does he cross that line and realise he’s more Na’vi than he is human? He could connect, he could plug in – Jake wants him to. I don’t want to tell you where it goes, but we’re gonna see all this play out, because Jake would rather have this guy on side.”Avatar: Fire and Ash trailer teases planetary peril and a crisis of faithRead moreGiven Cameron is planning at least five (possibly seven!) of these films, it is perhaps inevitable that some of the main characters will oscillate between hero and villain over the course of the journey. But do we really want to see Quaritch sanded down from a human tank? Is the saga’s main villain really about to turn to the good side? And do we really want him to?It wouldn’t be the first time Cameron has flipped a character’s entire persona mid-saga. Arnold Schwarzenegger’s T-800 was a time-travelling death robot in the firstTerminatorfilm and a leather-clad babysitter in the second, while Linda Hamilton’s Sarah Connor followed a reverse trajectory from terrified waitress to the most intense mum who ever lived. And yet both those arcs made sense: the T-800 would always manifest according to its most recent programming, while it’s hard to avoid becoming a battle-hardened maniac when you’ve just experienced the apocalypse on fast-forward.But Quaritch may be the most villainy villain in the history of genre movies: a walking embodiment of humanity’s desire to punch nature in the face; a totem of the military-industrial super-complex. And to be honest, we kind of liked him that way. Now what? We’re suddenly meant to cheer for a bloke we once watched Neytiri skewer to his own power-loader like a human shish kebab?This impending redemption arc also raises the question of whether other key players might find themselves undergoing full personality transfers before the seven-movie series is up. For what film-maker, given 1,200 minutes to play with, wouldn’t choose to spin the entire saga’s moral compass like a fidget toy? Neytiri may decide she has always secretly loved rampant space colonialism. Spider could announce he’s joining the RDA for the dental plan. Norm Spellman might run off to start a Pandora-themed gastropub. Probably none of them will mind you – because unlike Quaritch, they know who they are. The recombinant, on the other hand, has room to become something else because he isn’t really Quaritch at all. He’s a man with the memories of the villainous human from 2009’sAvatar, but almost none of the biology, context or identity.The Terminator at 40: did James Cameron see into the future?Read morePerhaps this is the reason the RDA’s resurrected attack dog seems to be interacting with the new volcano-dwelling Na’vi tribe in all the early footage we’ve seen from Fire and Ash. If there’s a reason Cameron keeps hauling him back from oblivion – and we really have to believe there is – it’s because Quaritch is the narrative cipher the saga can still reshape. He’s the one character who can plausibly stand between the species rather than fully belong to either one. Which means he might hold the key to whatever future Pandora is heading toward – not the tidy ending where the humans pack up and go home, nor the absolutist fantasy where the Na’vi win every fight for ever, but something messier, stranger, and shared, dancing together among the floating bioluminescent jellyfish.Explore more on these topicsFilmWeek in geekAvatarJames CameronScience fiction and fantasy filmscommentShareReuse this content"

It’s unpopular enough playing the antagonist who murders a long-running TV character. When your victim is a fan favourite, though, you risk being vilified even more. So what’s it like being the ultimate baddy and breaking viewers’ hearts? Do they get booed in the street or trolled online? We asked five actors who killed off beloved characters – from Spooks toThe Sopranos, Wolf Hall to Westeros – about their experiences …‘After the Red Wedding, people walked away from me backwards’Michael McElhatton played Roose Bolton, who stabbed Robb Stark in the infamous Red Wedding episode of Game of ThronesView image in fullscreenKnife and death … Richard Madden as Robb Stark and Michael McElhatton as Roose Bolton in Game of Thrones.Photograph: Helen Sloan/HBO“It was 13 years ago but I vividly remember filming the Red Wedding. How could you not? We shot it over five days, all blocked out like a play, which never happens in film or TV. Three major characters got killed: Talisa (Oona Chaplin), Robb (Richard Madden) and Catelyn (Michelle Fairley). It’s a huge turning point and where Game of Thrones truly took off. In fact, that was the part of the books that convinced David Benioff and DB Weiss to acquire the TV rights. They said ‘As long as they don’t cancel us before the Red Wedding, we’re fine!’I was in the makeup trailer next to this guy who was dressed as a lowly serf. As we walked to the set, I introduced myself and he said: ‘I’m Will, I’m playing one of the musicians.’ I figured he was a specialist in Elizabethan instruments or something. I said: ‘Are you a musician in real life? Are you in a band? Having any luck?’ He said, ‘We’re doing all right.’ ‘What are you called?’ ‘Coldplay.’ I went: ‘Oh god!’ It was Will Champion, the drummer. I spent the next four days trying to ingratiate myself.It’s magnificent TV. Catelyn notices the door being locked. The music changes. Then she realises I’m wearing chainmail under my shirt and all hell kicks off. I stab Robb in the heart but they did that digitally. I just had the handle of a dagger in my hand. I was right up in Richard’s face, watching him die. Brutal. There’s a great meme of me doing it with Trump.I snarl ‘The Lannisters send their regards’ and had no idea it would become a standout quote. It’s on T-shirts, tote bags, all sorts. I wish I got royalties but it’sGeorge RR Martin’s line. A friend was in LA and a driver had run into the back of another car. There was a huge dent and they’d written in it ‘The Lannisters send their regards.’ I was tickled by that.When the episode aired, my phone lit up with messages saying: ‘What have you done?’ I was doing a play in London and saw an entire tube carriage where every passenger was reading a free newspaper with four pages of graphic Red Wedding photos inside. I stood by the train door, pulling my baseball cap down. I hadn’t appreciated the enormity of it as a cultural moment until then. People didn’t treat me differently but they did tend to walk away backwards!”‘Shooting Adriana was my hardest scene ever’MusicianSteven Van Zandt played Silvio Dante, who whacked mob wifeAdriana La Cervain the woods inseason five of The SopranosView image in fullscreenHit episode … Drea de Matteo as Adriana La Cervaand Steven Van Zandt as Silvio Dante in The Sopranos.Photograph: HBO“The way I got the role is ridiculous. [Sopranos creator] David Chase was a fan of our music, saw me make a speech at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and offered me a part. I said: ‘I’d feel guilty taking an actor’s job.’ He said: ‘That’s OK, I’ll write a new character for you.’ Casting me was a ballsy move. David handed me a gift by making me an actor. It changed my career.My whole life had been research. I’d read every mob book, seen every gangster movie and grew up around scary guys in our neighbourhood. I wrote a backstory for Silv and made him nostalgic for the good old days when guys didn’t rat each other out. That’s why he had that 50s hairstyle. I wasn’t originally meant to be Tony Soprano’s consigliere but the writers picked up on my relationship with [actor] Jimmy Gandolfini and made me underboss. I knew that dynamic well because I had a similar relationship with Bruce [Springsteen] in the E Street Band. His trusted right-hand man.Silvio had ascended to executive level and was only brought in for special hits. That was the case with Adriana. It was the hardest scene I’ve ever done. My whole life’s been dedicated to stopping bullies. That’s why I took on the South African government [founding Artists United Against Apartheid]. Putting my hands on a woman and roughing her up was difficult. Any violence towards women is repulsive to me. But Drea [de Matteo, who played Adriana] said: ‘This is my last scene, let’s make it a good one. Don’t go easy on me.’ Afterwards, we lay down in the leaves and I said: ‘You just won your first Emmy.’ And she did.Knocking off regulars were the hardest days on set. It was normally a wonderful atmosphere but suddenly people were bickering and uptight. It was the same when we killed Vinny Pastore [who played Big Pussy] on the boat. Those were the two most emotional days in the whole eight years. To be respectful, we don’t show the moment of Adriana’s death, you just hear gunshots. It sparked conspiracy theories about whether he’d really killed her. Jay Leno asked me on his talkshow. I said: ‘What do you think I was doing in the woods, shooting squirrels?’Just to show how sick the world is, after the episode aired, a few people came up and said: ‘Good job, man, she deserved that.’ I’d be like: ‘What’s the matter with you? She was a perfectly innocent girl.’ But for every one of those, hundreds more were heartbroken. Eventually justice was done and Silvio himself got shot. I didn’t want to die, so David left me in a coma as a compromise. I would have survived for a sequel, trust me! Even today in meetings, I wish I was Silvio. I’d get a lot more done!”‘It was like a western on the streets of Belfast’Art Campion played gangster Sully,who gunned downPC Gerry Cliffin the debut series ofBelfast police drama Blue LightsView image in fullscreenBang, bang … Art Campion as Sully in Blue Lights.Photograph: Steffan Hill/BBC“The shootout was like a western. We cordoned off a whole street and had weapons training. I’ve been around a few guns for gigs and the blast off a blank is powerful. I’m very aware of how lethal they can be. If you put a blank in front of an orange, it’ll explode. An armourer would pop in between takes, show me the barrel and we’d be good to go.I wore squibs under my hoodie, so when Sully shot Gerry [played by Richard Dormer], then got gunned down by Jen [fellow officer, played by Hannah McClean], she fired in a certain rhythm – bang-bang, bang-bang, bang – which put me down against a lamppost. It’s handy because you can feel the squibs going off and it helps you jolt. I deliberately didn’t place my head very well, to make it look realistically clumsy but ended up lying there quite a while, regretting that. I was moving house at the time and remember lying in a pool of blood, haggling on the phone with a builder.View image in fullscreenWrong place, wrong time … Richard Dormer as Gerry Cliff in Blue Lights.Photograph: Steffan Hill/BBCI’d just played Father Peter in Derry Girls, so it was nice to show people that I’m not only a priest with existential doubts. I can also be a cocaine-sniffing, gun-toting lunatic! Viewers had got attached to Gerry. He was the heart of the show, a lovable character, so they were genuinely affected by his death.

Me and Eddie should meet for a pint and compare notes.”‘Nicola Walker was the perfect castmate to kill!’Tom Weston-Jonesplayed Russian agentSasha Gavrik, who killedSpooksfavouriteRuth Evershedin the last ever episode of the BBC spy sagaView image in fullscreenShock factor … Tom Weston-Jones as Sasha Gavrik in Spooks.Photograph: Angus Muir/BBC“Spooks was my first job out of drama school. I went all in with the Russian accent and had this Justin Bieber-esque hairstyle. As they cut it in, I went: ‘He doesn’t look very dangerous.’ They were like: ‘That’s why it’ll be a surprise when Sasha does what he does.’ It was quite intimidating coming into a close-knit cast and crew but Nicola Walker was so welcoming, any sense of guilt about killing her immediately evaporated. She made light of it all and was the perfect castmate to kill!The stabbing had a tragic happenstance to it. It wasn’t premeditated, it was almost a crime of passion. It felt like a shock twist, which made it all the more effective. I stabbed her with a shard of broken glass, which was fake – made of plastic. I was trying to kill Harry [Pearce, played by Peter Firth] but Ruth got in the way and bled out from her belly. Who knows how fans would have responded if I’d got Harry instead? Imagine if it had been both of them! I probably wouldn’t be here today. Meanwhile, my character gets shot in the leg and carted off. My father was convinced I got shot in the arse, which amused him.View image in fullscreen‘If you make millions of viewers cry, you’ve done the job right’ … Nicola Walker as Ruth Evershed in Spooks.Photograph: Amanda Searle/BBC/KudosEveryone came down to the location, even people who weren’t working that day, just to be there for the goodbye. It felt very special. The tears were genuine from a lot of people. There was a real sense of an ending. Ruth and Harry had this semi-platonic love story for nine series and I ruined it. Fans clung to the hope that she wasn’t really dead. People would say: ‘That’s not it, though, is it? Surely that’s not the end?’People on the tube shook their fists at me. I joined Twitter a few years later and people messaged me saying: ‘You know what you did!’ They were cross but in a tongue-in-cheek way. Every so often, people still say: ‘You’re the one who killed Ruth.’ If you make millions of viewers cry, you’ve done the job right. Long may it continue. Perhaps they’ll be blaming me for the rest of my life.”‘Everyone looked worried. Just as well Claire Foy was blindfolded’Philippe Spall played the Calais Executioner,who beheadedAnne Boleynat the climax of series one of period drama Wolf HallView image in fullscreenNo mercy … Claire Foy as Anne Boleyn and Philippe Spall as the Calais Executioner in Wolf Hall.Photograph: BBC“I’m half-French, so when Wolf Hall needed a Calais swordsman, I was called in to meet director Peter Kosminsky. It was written in Hilary Mantel’s novel that Anne Boleyn’s executioner was almost balletic. They wanted a swift, merciful death. The fight director showed me medieval woodcuts of him in these flamenco-like poses. There’s theatricality to it – unlike poor old Thomas More, who just got his head lopped off with an axe.We shot the beheading at Dover Castle, which stood in for the Tower 0f London, in mid-July. You’d expect it to be lovely and sunny but the gods went: ‘We’re not having that.’ It suddenly turned into this dull day with wind whistling around the courtyard, which added to the spooky atmosphere. The weapon was extraordinary – a huge sword, handmade for the show, as close to the original specifications as they could. It was ridiculously heavy. Afterwards, they went: ‘Maybe we should have done it in aluminium?’ I trained out the back of my house with a scaffolding pole to get used to its weight. I remember my neighbours going: “All right there, Phil? Just practising?”Swinging it at Claire Foy became an interesting exercise. For the first few takes, they said: ‘Stop your swing at the top of the arc,’ but the director of photography said: ‘No, he needs to swing it near her head.’ Everyone looked worried but we got something that looked very realistic. Probably just as well that Claire was blindfolded, so she didn’t realise quite how close I was getting.I slip off my shoes, so she won’t hear me coming. Another period detail was that the headsman stands to one side and says ‘Apportez l’épée’ (‘Bring me the sword’). Anne speaks French, so she snaps her head round, exposing the tendons in her neck for a clean cut. I dance across to the other side and swing. The prosthetic head was fitted with a pump, so fake blood gushed out of the severed neck over Anne’s maids. They wrap up the head and carry off the body because they don’t want the men to touch her.I was lucky that in the sequel,The Mirror and the Light, I haunt Thomas Cromwell’s nightmares. They used old footage but it’s great to pop up in both series. It’s not the only royal TV death I’ve been involved in. A few years later, I was the Parisian dogwalker inThe Crownwho calls 999 when Diana’s car crashes. Royalty, death, French – that seems to have become my niche!”Explore more on these topicsTelevisionSpooksGame of ThronesWolf HallBlue LightsThe SopranosDramafeaturesShareReuse this content"

Ahead of its release, the director and his stars reveal the explicit shots snipped from the final cut and discuss why Pride has become too sanitisedFri 21 Nov 2025 00.00 ESTShareHarry Melling knows the secret to being a good boot-licker. “You want to give a decent, satisfying, sexy lick,” says the 36-year-old actor, who has the umlaut eyes and nasal tones of Nicholas Lyndhurst. “Once you get to the toe-cap, you need to make sure they can really feel your tongue through the leather.”Melling, barely recognisable from his childhood role as wretched Dudley Dursley in the Harry Potter films, learned this new skill while preparing for the award-winning BDSM romcom Pillion. He plays Colin, a timid traffic warden who becomes the willing submissive to a taciturn biker named Ray. Listening intently to Melling’s boot-licking tips in this London hotel room are his Pillion partners-in-kink: Harry Lighton, the film’s 33-year-old writer-director, whose flat cap and smirk lend him a roguish look, andAlexander Skarsgård, 49, who plays Ray, and is dressed today in a slobby ensemble – red sweatshirt, blue tracksuit bottoms, black shoes – that fails to spoil his pin-up prettiness.Pillion review – 50 shades of BDSM Wallace and Gromit in brilliant Bromley biker romanceRead moreIn the name of research, Melling and Lighton hung out with the Gay Bikers Motorcycle Club (GBMCC), some of whom appear in the film as members of Ray’s gang. “The organisation crosses over into leather culture but it isn’t focused on sex,” says Lighton. “We supplemented them in the film with people from the kink community. Have I told you about the weekend I spent with the GBMCC?” No, I tell him: we’ve never met before. “Yes, we have,” he jokes. “You just don’t remember.” Skarsgård chips in: “Harry was wearing a mask.”As part of his GBMCC weekend, Lighton was taken on an eight-hour pillion ride. “I wanted to look hot but they gave me these dumpy safety leathers instead. I looked like a spaceman. My main preoccupation was that I wasn’t getting the Grindr photos I’d hoped for.” What did he have to do to prove his commitment to the bikers? His eyes twinkle: “Suck dick,” he says.While Lighton was speeding around the UK on the back of a bike and Melling was licking boots, Skarsgård was doing … not much. “I didn’t create any backstory,” he says. “It was great!” Colin discovers next to nothing about Ray, and neither do we: he is an enigma wrapped in a riddle and zipped into motorcycle leathers. “The material lent itself to just showing up and doing it,” the actor continues.View image in fullscreenAlexander Skarsgård as Ray in Pillion.Photograph: Courtesy of Picturehouse EntertainmentThat may explain the tingling electricity between the two leads. “In our last scene together, there’s a look Alex gives me which I was not anticipating,” says Melling. “I almost felt as if I saw through Ray in some sense. It was a revelation. What happened still feels massively mysterious to me.”“I can dispel the mystery right now,” Skarsgård says matter-of-factly. “We shot that on a Friday afternoon and I had an evening flight back to Stockholm for the weekend. So the look was, like, ‘Dude. Don’t fuck this up. I’ve got to be in the car to Heathrow in three minutes.’” Spoken like a true dom.Before production began, Lighton sent Melling a 20-page starter pack of references and images to help with playing Colin. Was there a Beginner’s Guide to Ray as well? Skarsgård looks blank.“I did send you one,” the film-maker says, “but I never heard back.”Skarsgård narrows his eyes. “Did you get a thank-you note from my assistant?” he asks, prompting much laughter.“I sent it direct to you,” Lighton replies, a touch forlornly. Then he turns to Melling. “You read yours,” he says.“Oh, you’resucha good boy,” sneers Skarsgård.“I’m a sub,” Melling says, smugly.“Well, I was already in my dom mode,” his co-star shoots back. “I was like: ‘I’m not reading this. Fuck off!’Thatwas my character development.”View image in fullscreenHarry Melling as Colin.Photograph: Ana Blumenkron/Courtesy of Picturehouse EntertainmentOne of the miracles of Pillion is that it makes good on the promise of Lighton’s short films, including 2016’sSunday Morning Coming Down(teenager finds a seaside glory hole) and 2017’sWren Boys(same-sex marriage in prison), which had already earned him a reputation as a stylish queer storyteller. He was planning to make his debut feature about sumo wrestling when a producer sent him a copy of Adam Mars-Jones’s transgressive novella Box Hill, winner of the 2019 Fitzcarraldo Editions novel prize, with a view to adapting it. In the book, subtitled A Story of Low Self-Esteem and set in the 1970s, Colin is an 18-year-old closeted virgin when he trips over Ray in the Surrey beauty spot previously associated with the picnic scene in Jane Austen’s Emma. (There’s a picnic in Pillion, too, though the meat on offer is very different from the “cold collation” served in Austen’s novel.)In the book, Colin is raped by Ray. Love then grows over the abuse like a cataract. “It has aspects of Stockholm syndrome,” Lighton says. For the film, he updated the setting, altered key details (Colin is now out and in his 30s) and removed the rape. “I wanted Ray to get consent from Colin in that first sexual encounter.”He is referring to the blowjob that takes place in a dark alley near Primark on Christmas Day, with Colin kneeling in front of the strapping, impassive biker. “The three of us discussed that scene a lot,” recalls Skarsgård. “We tried a version that felt aggressive, but we all wanted to pull back from that.” Melling leans in. “I’m so glad we did,” he says, “because in terms of Colin’s entry point into the relationship, it opens up a whole other avenue.” Skarsgård takes up the idea: “Yeah, the audience needs to be with Colin on this, and not feel he was raped in an alley.” No one could accuse the film of stinting on raunchiness, but Lighton did make one snip to that scene. “Originally, there was a closeup of Ray’s bell-end,” he says. “But it would have punctured the tension and raised a laugh.”Alexander Skarsgård: ‘There’s a politeness to Swedes. It’s a facade. Deep down we’re animals’Read moreIn various drafts of the script, Lighton tried transposing the action to ancient Rome, or a modern-day cruise ship. I heard he even wrote a version set in space. “That’s not true,” he says. “But it could be great.” Skarsgård sounds excited: “BDSM in space suits! I love that. The only problem would be once they start to unzip …Brrffft!” He mimes his internal organs being sucked out. “Also, it would be quite hard to overpower someone in zero gravity,” says Lighton, cooling on the idea.Why drive so far around the houses only to end up back with a queer motorcycle gang, just like in Box Hill? “I loved the DNA of the novel, but because it was my first film, I wanted to bend it out of shape to see how I could make it mine. Hubris took me to ancient Rome. It’s also how my writing process works; I get frustrated by something and chuck it all up in the air.”Besides, it’s not as if Pillion-with-gladiators is his maddest idea. Five years ago, he had a meeting with producers after being out late the night before. Bereft of inspiration, he reached for one of his childhood crushes: Groundskeeper Willie from The Simpsons. “He’s super buff and he’s got that big beard. I remember when he took his shirt off, I was, like: ‘That’s my guy.’ So I pitched them the live-action version of Groundskeeper Willie starring Michael Fassbender. They were kind of interested but they thought there might be a rights issue.” No kidding.Lighton’s circuitous adaptation process did at least help him solve what he considered a narrative problem: Ray’s death, two-thirds of the way through the book. “It was only through writing the cruise ship version that I discovered I didn’t want to kill him off.” Film Ray survives. But what of Colin’s low self-esteem? “I think that’s still there. He’s sexually nervous, lives with his parents and doesn’t like his job. The difference is there’s an aspect of self-hatred in the novel, whereas I wanted to shift that into self-doubt so that when he jumps off the cliff into this new life, the catalyst is more of a positive force than a negative one.”View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of Picturehouse EntertainmentThe trailer even features an approving quote describing Pillion as “feelgood”. As well it might for a movie that embraces the kink community without shame or judgment. Lighton has little tolerance for the “No Kink at Pride” discourse which accompanied the drift of LGBTQ+ festivals into the mainstream. “Now that Pride is a family event, there’s this idea that kinks are unsuitable to be seen in public. But Pride began as a call to arms for queer people, so it’s the marginalised ones, the kinksters, who should be given pride of place, not the families with five-year-olds. I feel proud to have made a film that celebrates people who exist on the outskirts, and treats them with empathy.”Awkward clapping, no-sand beaches and Alexander Skarsgård’s thigh-high boots: a trip to Cannes to see my filmRead moreSkarsgård agrees. “There’s a risk when you tell a story about a subculture that you can paint too rosy a picture,” he says. “But what I love about this is that it’s so confidently warts-and-all. It’s funny, it’s sexy and you believe in the characters. We never wanted to pander to straight audiences but I also think my mum’s gonna like the film. We didn’tmakeit for her but she can enjoy it.”One audience member to whom Lighton is nervous about showing Pillion is his twin brother. Though he describes him as “my best mate”, there is some intriguing historical tension between them. Their father, Sir Thomas Lighton, is a baronet. “It’s just a title,” the director says, not sounding overjoyed to be asked about it. Did he grow up in a palace? “I didn’t. Sorry to disappoint.” The baronetcy will pass eventually to Lighton Sr’s eldest son – not Lighton but his twin, who was born six minutes before him.“When did you find out about the title?” asks Melling.“I was seven or eight,” he says. “I thought I might kill my brother because that’s what you read about in history books. It used to piss me off that he’d get ‘Sir’ and I’d get nothing.”“I can call you ‘Sir’ if you want,” offers Skarsgård.Trailer for Pillion.“I’d rather have a military title like ‘Sergeant’,” says Lighton. “That’s hotter. Being a ‘Sir’ is a bit of an ick. Anyway, I’m over it now.”The evidence suggests otherwise. In the film, Lighton has saddled Colin with a twin brother “who’s a bit of a flannel”. There was also a twin in his first short, Sunday Morning Coming Down. “He was a bit of a dick as well,” he laughs. It might seem as if he has made amends by giving his brother a brief walk-on part in Pillion as an amateur footballer. “Although I did cut his head off in the shot.” That’s quite the power play. If there isn’t a film to be made about all of this, I’ll eat my biker boot.Pillion is in UK cinemas from 28 November, US cinemas on 6 February and Australian cinemas on 19 FebruaryExplore more on these topicsFilmAlexander SkarsgårdLGBTQ+ rightsinterviewsShareReuse this content"

But songs confronting the Troubles, poverty and oppression are now going global – and changing how Ireland sees itselfAnna CafollaFri 21 Nov 2025 03.00 ESTShareOn a hot Saturday afternoon at Glastonbury, while many are nursing halfway-point hangovers, the Dublin garage punk quartet Sprints whip up a jubilant mosh pit with their charged tune Descartes, Irish tricolour flags bobbing above them. As summer speeds on, at Japan’s Fuji rock festival, new songs from Galway indie act NewDad enrapture the crowd. Travy, a Nigerian-born and Tallaght-raised rapper, crafts a mixtape inflected with his Dublin lilt, the follow-up to the first Irish rap album to top the Irish charts. Efé transcends Dublin bedroom pop to get signed by US label Fader, and on Later … With Jools Holland, George Houston performs the haunting Lilith – a tribute to political protest singers everywhere – in a distinctive Donegal accent.From Melbourne to Mexico City, concertgoers continue to scream to that opening loop on strings of Fontaines DC’s Starburster, and CMAT’s viral “woke macarena” dance to her hit single Take a Sexy Picture of Me plays out in festival pits and on TikTok. You might have heard about Kneecap, too.View image in fullscreenLeading the charge … CMAT performs at Norway’s Bergenfest 2024.Photograph: Per Ole Hagen/RedfernsIreland has always had a fair few punks, ravers and big indie acts, be it the Cranberries, Ash or Bicep, but it’s never had an alternative music scene quite as robust or diverse as today’s: Lankum, Gilla Band, Pillow Queens, For Those I Love, John Francis Flynn and Chalk are some of the other acclaimed names, alongside a thriving underground rap scene. It’s now so successful that it is redefining what “Irish music” even is, as doors open to musicians once left out of the country’s cultural conversation.“It’s been an Irish renaissance,” says Karla Chubb, Sprints’ singer and guitarist. The group are now midway through a UK tour, with US shows next year; they are the first Irish band signed to US indie label Sub Pop. She cites Fontaines DC and CMAT as “a blueprint” for making it internationally. “As a Dublin band, you’d once have hoped to play Vicar Street”, a mid-sized venue. “Now we have the drive to go bigger.” Music, she says, is no longer an “unpaid internship”.View image in fullscreen‘A universal understanding’ … Gurriers.Photograph: Joshua MulhollandUniting today’s acts is a spirit of rebellion, quick wit and vulnerable lyricism, with recurring themes of solidarity and marginalisation, made by a youth still emerging from the Troubles and the legacy of the Celtic Tiger (the Irish property boom, 2008 crash and subsequent recession). Sprints lit up a banner for trans rights during their Glasto set, while Dundalk act the Mary Wallopers had their set at Portsmouth’s Victorious festival cut after they voiced their support for Palestine. Irish Artists for Palestine recently facilitated an Irish tour for the all-women Palestinian choir Daughters of Jerusalem. “This understanding of oppression and colonialism we have is generational,” saysDan Hoff of Dublin five-piece Gurriers.Sprints’ second album, released in September, is “inspired by the disparity of finally realising our dreams and doing music full-time, against the homeless crisis in Ireland, the war in Gaza, the cost of living,” says Chubb. “They’re issues all acrossEurope, so on an international stage, we’re shining a light on a shared struggle.”“The songs are written about Ireland, but I wanted to write them in a universal understanding,” says Hoff. His band Gurriers released debut album Come and See in 2024, supported Fontaines DC and landed a track on EA Sports FC 26. The band are vexed about the far right’s rise in Ireland and beyond, and their spitting protest song Approachable was written in the voice of an online rightwing edgelord; Dipping Out is about the Irish emigrating, but expands, Hoff says, “like an Adam Curtis documentary, critiquing the zeitgeist.“People feel isolated and let down by those in power … the situation isn’t just an Irish one. I try to avoid any Irish idioms in my lyrics,” Hoff adds.“The world is pretty much on fire … and against this rise in AI-generated music, people want something real and grounding. This is something Ireland does incredibly well,” says Nikki MacRae, music officer at Belfast city council. “Irish songwriters have always championed authenticity, and audiences crave this more than ever.”“Irishness has become a thing people covet,” agrees Julie Dawson of NewDad, “which is mad, because not too long ago it was something people scorned.” For years British listeners would mostly reach for mainstream acts (Westlife, U2, the Corrs, B*Witched) or trad folk. Meanwhile, radio in Ireland has long been dominated by British and US acts, or otherwise limited to domestic acts Snow Patrol and Hozier, with most Irish artists deemed niche. “About nine years ago, a local artist once had their track turned down for radio play because they’d already played an Irish track that week,” says MacRae. “What makes Irish musicians class is that in the face of such challenges they double down.”Trad metal outfit the Scratch’s Cathal McKenna recalls 2011’s Oxegen festival, held not far outside Dublin, and hosting almost exclusively international headliners. “We took our influences from them … Now, seeing Ireland’s festivals filled with Irish acts feels powerful,” McKenna says, from All Together Now to Electric Picnic. “People have their own stories, languages and cities represented by amazing artists. We’re naturally confident now in a way we just weren’t back then.”View image in fullscreen‘We’re naturally confident now in a way we just weren’t back then’ … the Scratch.Photograph: Evan DohertyAs well as the music itself, there are some clear forces behind this shift. A generation of gen Z and millennial artists are reckoning with what it meant to come of age through recession, austerity and the tail end of the Troubles. The music pulsates with the sense of promises made and withdrawn: CMAT pricks the economic bubble and its devastating aftermath on her song Euro-Country, symbolised by her dancing around her soullesshometown shopping centrein the video. But there is a defiant call-to-action too. “I know it can be better if we hound it,” she sings.InNorthern Ireland, noise-punk band Enola Gay’s track PTS.DUP addressed a sectarian attack on guitarist Joe McVeigh that left him with a fractured skull. Meanwhile, on their thrashing Stiff Little Fingers-influenced song I Think You Should Leave, queer DIY punk band Problem Patterns still find hope in building community in Belfast: “Everything always comes back to the Troubles,” the song goes, “we’ve got to release the dead hand of the past.”“I think artists from Northern Ireland are thriving right now because we’ve all grown up with generational trauma and that makes for some excellent art,” says the band’s Beth Crooks. “The song is about how we love living here, in spite of the mass emigration that we see from our peers. If the right people stick around and push for change then it’s bound to happen.”View image in fullscreen‘The music scene is at a really exciting place’ … Spider.Photograph: Camille AlexanderJames Robinson, founder of Belfast’s Craic magazine, says the renaissance is partly down to local media outlets such as the Thin Air, Yeo, Nialler9 and District documenting these scenes before the British or international press caught on, alongside conferences such as Output and AVA festival, all of them “encouraging more acts to start up and keep the momentum going”. The British media’s recent embrace of politically vocal Irish artists, he adds, suggests a “somewhat British fragility” about overlooking this scene in previous generations; a move past the shamrocks’n’Guinness fetishisation of Irish culture to instead really listen to Irish voices.Numerous people I speak to say another chief reason for such a thriving scene is Ireland’s growing cultural diversity. “Artists are shouting loud in the face of attempts to narrow the perception of what is Irish,” says MacRae, as xenophobic and racist unrest has gripped the country in recent months.Belfast-based rapper Emby brought dance music festival AVA its first ever grime set. After competing against Beyoncé and the Weeknd at the 2025 Grammys, another Belfast boy, Jordan Adetunji, continues to blend quickfire rap with trap, post-punk guitars and African dance. Spider, the Tallaght-born, now London-based producer, grew up on 90s riot grrrl acts such as Bikini Kill and Veruca Salt. Like McKenna, she had few Irish references (save, she says, for the Cranberries), and even now, “the scene can be very white and male-dominated”, she says. “But it’s at a really exciting place. We’re seeing more Irish people of colour, women and queer people come up, and the music is only getting better.”Monjola is the co-founder of Dublin’s five-year-old Chamomile Club label and collective. Their slogan is BKDI: Black Kids Doing It. “We’ve established an ecosystem,” says Monjola. “We’re musicians but also videographers, graphic designers, producers, stylists.” Chamomile act Moio crossed over with 2024 single Moments, topping Spotify’s Viral 50. “The Black Irish experience is super unique,” Monjola adds. “We don’t have a blueprint, so we’re following our gut – and that’s resonating.”‘We just want to stop people being murdered’: Kneecap on Palestine, protest and provocationRead moreBallymun-founded rap group Bricknasty blend hip-hop, neo-soul, rave and garage with lyrics in Gaelic – their single Is é a Locht a Laghad is a stark track about heritage and hardship. Frontman Fatboy says he was “eating curry-paste wraps because I couldn’t buy chicken” – until they supported Coldplay at Dublin’s Croke Park as the backing band for Irish singer Aby Coulibaly, and put together their recent mixtape Black’s Law. They’re now getting ready for their first US headline tour in February. “You get a false sense of being class playing in Ireland, because the crowds are so deadly [good],” Fatboy says. “Sometimes what you need is to get ribbed. That’s how you learn.” They’ve won plenty of audiences over, though: “Seeing people elsewhere respond because they’ve gone through similar things is magical.”Breakthroughs such as theirsare far from being a given, and artists from bigger cities tend to get more opportunities, but arts centres such as the Duncairn in Belfast encourage cross-border collaboration, creating fertile ground for agents and labels to scout.View image in fullscreen‘We’re following our gut’ … Monjola perform at Cork Opera House, 2025.Photograph: Kieran Frost/RedfernsAnother huge boost came in October, when the Irish government announced that a pilot basic-income scheme for artists would become permanent. Public support has been strong, and anindependent studyfrom Alma Economics found it improved recipients’ creative productivity and mental wellbeing. With artists receiving €325 (£286) a week, the pilot schemecost €25ma year, a relatively small investment to keep an entire arts scene thriving. Daniel “Lango” Lang of the Scratch says high youth unemployment once drove them to music: “The big challenge for young artists now is the cost of living, but a thriving scene breeds confidence.”That confidence isn’t just firing up this new generation of acts – it’s changing the way Irish people think about themselves. “As a people, we are very self-effacing,” NewDad’s Dawson says. “We feel sincerely thankful – and even surprised – that people show up for us. I never thought a band formed by a bunch of teenagers in Galway would one day stand up on a big stage in Japan.”Everyone I speak to has someone else to hype up, be it dream-pop and the Cure support act Just Mustard, folk collective Madra Salach, ambient artist Saoirse Miller or alt-rapper Khakikid. “We’re so proud of ourselves,” Dawson says. “Which is hard to say as an Irish person.”Explore more on these topicsMusicPop and rockIndieMetalHip-hopRapFolk musicfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Allan Clayton captures the febrile nature of the dying man whose every sensation is both a terror and a fascination. His heroic tone thrills in the great prayer, Sanctus Fortis, while an expressive use of text illuminates the philosophical question and answer session in Part Two. Jamie Barton’s luxurious mezzo-soprano possesses a tangible immediacy as well as offering ample reserves of comfort. James Platt’s craggy bass is well-suited to the Angel of the Agony.Gardner is intensely dramatic, conveying the narrative with an almost operatic boldness. The London Philharmonic plays as if a chorus of demons was at its heels, matched by the combined forces of the London Philharmonic and Hallé choirs. Here and there, the acoustic robs the recording of the last ounce of immediacy, but all in all it’s a fine achievement to rank alongside Nicholas Collon’s arresting Finnish account released earlier this year.Allow content provided by a third party?This article includes content hosted onembed.music.apple.com.

Parmigianino painted a nude adolescent Cupid sharpening his bow, Bronzino depicted him pleasuring his mother, Venus. This is one of several paintings in which Cranach portrays the mischievous deity as a naughty boy who has got stung by bees while stealing honey. The meaning is none too subtle: love hurts. It has a darker sting than we might give it, though, because Cranach was a religious radical and Martin Luther’s best man. So it is sin that aches. But, in a daring twist, Cranach paints Venus erotically and seductively.

The show will begin with Joyce as the teenage time-traveller before Brauch takes over for the middle section and Dobson ends in the role. All three will then perform the final number, Back in Time, together.“Originating the role of Marty is undeniably the highlight of my career,” said Dobson. “To be stepping back into his shoes for one night only is super exciting.” Dobson performed the partat the Manchester Opera Housein 2020 and at the Adelphi in its2021 West End premierewhich was delayed by the Covid-19 pandemic. “It’s such a thrill to return to this production,” Joyce said. “I’m so excited to perform alongside both Olly and Caden – it’s not often you get three Martys on one stage!” Back to the Future brought Dobson an Olivier award nomination for best actor in a musical. Joyce received a WhatsOnStage award nomination for best takeover for his performance.Brauch began in the role earlier this year. Gok Wan recently made a cameo appearance as Principal Strickland in the show to celebrate Back to the Future Day on 21 October, the date that Marty travels to the future in Back to the Future Part II. The film sequel uses trickery to find Michael J Foxsharing the screen with himselfin a scene when Marty has a near run-in with his future son.Guest appearances at gala musical productions provide the audience, often comprising diehard fans, with a unique experience such as when five actors who have played Rafiki around Europe came together at the culmination of aWest End gala for The Lion Kingin 2024. Les Misérables celebrated its 40th birthday in October by bringing stars including Patti LuPone and Michael Ball on stage to sing a finale. Going one step further, Kerry Ellis, Louise Dearman and Rachel Tucker – who have all played Elphaba in Wicked – will tour together next year with a concert entitled Gravity featuring songs from their musical careers, including Wicked.When Back to the Future was released in 1985, theHollywood Reporterannounced: “The movie isn’t just fun. It’s fun at the speed of light, a whiz-bang time-travel adventure likely to result in some decidedly high-octane box office dollars.”Explore more on these topicsTheatreMusicalsWest EndBack To The FuturenewsShareReuse this content"

The alleged victim was not a contestant or professional dancer, the paper said.Hertfordshire police confirmed the arrest and said inquiries were continuing.The force told the Sun: “A man was released on police bail under investigation having been arrested in London on Monday 13 October on suspicion of rape. The allegations relate to an incident which happened in Hertfordshire during 2024.“Meanwhile, inquiries by officers from Hertfordshire constabulary’s public protection team will continue. Given the nature of the allegations, it would be inappropriate to make any further comment at this time.”A BBC spokesperson said: “It would not be appropriate to comment on an ongoing police investigation.”Another male star of the BBC show was arrested in August on suspicion of rape. The man in his 30s, who has not been named, was detained over a separate alleged offence of “non-consensual intimate image abuse”.Explore more on these topicsStrictly Come DancingTelevisionBBCReality TVnewsShareReuse this content"

The trial in Washington DC includedtestimony from the actor Leonardo DiCaprioand the former attorney general Jeff Sessions.Justice department prosecutors said federal sentencing guidelines recommended a life sentence for Michel, who they said “betrayed his country for money” and “lied unapologetically and unrelentingly to carry out his schemes”.His sentence, they wrote, “should reflect the breadth and depth of his crimes, his indifference to the risks to his country, and the magnitude of his greed”.1MDB: The inside story of the world’s biggest financial scandal | Randeep RameshRead moreThe defence attorney Peter Zeidenberg said his client’s 14-year sentence was “completely disproportionate to the offence”. Michel will appeal against his conviction and sentence, according to his lawyer.Zeidenberg had recommended a three-year prison sentence. A life sentence would be an “absurdly high” punishment for Michel given that it is typically reserved for deadly terrorists and drug cartel leaders, Michel’s attorneys said in a court filing.“The government’s position is one that would cause Inspector Javert to recoil and, if anything, simply illustrates just how easily the guidelines can be manipulated to produce absurd results, and how poorly equipped they are, at least on this occasion, to determine a fair and just sentence,” they continued.In the early 2010s, Low – now a fugitive believed to be hiding in China – used billions of dollars stolen from a Malaysian state investment fund known as 1MDB to invest in luxury US real estate, fine art and Hollywood films such as DiCaprio’s The Wolf of Wall Street. Low has maintained his innocence.Michel was accused of helping Low secretly channel money into then president Barack Obama’s 2012 re-election campaign via shell companies, hiding the donations’ origins.Michel also tried to end a justice department investigation of Low, tampered with two witnesses and perjured himself at trial, prosecutors said.Michel, originally from Brooklyn, founded the Fugees with his childhood friends Lauryn Hill and Wyclef Jean.The group won two Grammy awards at the peak of their fame in the 1990s and sold tens of millions of albums.In August 2024, the judge rejected Michel’s request for a new trial based in part on his defence attorney’s use of a generative AI program during his closing of the trial’s arguments. The judges said that and other trial errors did not amount to a serious miscarriage of justice.Explore more on these topicsFugeesBarack ObamaLeonardo DiCaprioJeff SessionsnewsShareReuse this content"

The $54.7m sale smashes the record for Latin American art previously set by Kahlo’s painting Diego y Yo (Diego and I) in 2021 when it sold for $34.9m. That painting depicted the artist and her husband, the muralist Diego Rivera.Her paintings are reported to have sold privately for even more.View image in fullscreenEl sueño (La cama) on display at Sotheby’s auction rooms in London in September 2025.Photograph: Kirsty Wigglesworth/APThe self-portrait is among the few Kahlo pieces that has remained in private hands outsideMexico, where her body of work has been declared an artistic monument. Her works in both public and private collections within Mexico cannot be sold abroad or destroyed.The painting comes from a private collection, whose owner has not been disclosed, and is legally eligible for international sale. Some art historians have scrutinised the sale for cultural reasons, while others have raised concern that the painting – last exhibited publicly in the late 1990s – could again disappear from public view after the auction. It has already been requested for upcoming exhibitions in cities includingNew York, London and Brussels.Kahlo vibrantly and unsparingly depicted herself and events from her life, which was upended by a bus accident at 18. She started to paint while bedridden, underwent a series of painful surgeries on her damaged spine and pelvis, and then wore casts until her death in 1954 at age 47.During the years Kahlo was confined to her bed, she came to view it as a bridge between worlds as she explored her mortality.The painting is the star of a sale of more than 100 surrealist works by artists including Salvador Dalí, René Magritte, Max Ernst and Dorothea Tanning.Kahlo resisted being labeled a surrealist, a style of art that’s dreamlike and centres on a fascination with the unconscious mind.“I never painted dreams,” she once said. “I painted my own reality.”In its catalog note, Sotheby’s said the painting “offers a spectral meditation on the porous boundary between sleep and death.”“The suspended skeleton is often interpreted as a visualization of her anxiety about dying in her sleep, a fear all too plausible for an artist whose daily existence was shaped by chronic pain and past trauma,” the catalog notes.It has been a big week for art auctions in New York, with Sotheby’s selling $706m of modern art on Tuesday, including a painting by the Austrian artist Gustav Klimt selling for $236.4m tobecome the second most expensive work to sell at auction in history, and the most expensive work of modern art sold at auction. Rival auction house Christie’s also sold $690m worth of 20th-century art.Associated Press contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsFrida KahloArtNew YorkMexicoAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

That state of affairs is slowly changingIlie Mitaru in Decatur, TexasFri 21 Nov 2025 05.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 21 Nov 2025 13.30 ESTShareBoosted by cultural phenomena like the hit series Yellowstone and Beyonce’s Cowboy Carter album and tour, rodeo and all things Western are enjoying a cultural resurgence. Attendance, broadcast and streaming viewership are at all time highs. So is the prize money, which is attracting more and more young athletes seeking a chance to make a name for themselves.But while rodeo is booming, athlete development remains antiquated.“The sport of rodeo is decades behind.” said Doug Champion, 36, founder of Optimal Performance Academy, a new rodeo school working to modernize athlete development in a sport whose frontier roots and culture of rugged individualism has been slow to adopt modern sports science. “It’s always been ‘rodeo cowboy,’ we are just now entering the chapter of the ‘rodeo athlete.’”Historically, there has been very little money to support anyone outside the very top rodeo athletes, which fostered a culture that prized tradition and toughness, as opposed to exploring innovation in their sport.View image in fullscreenJoe Ernst, head of rider development at the PBR, the world’s largest rodeo league, shows Matt Gordon how to work the chain to test pull-strength.View image in fullscreenColt Morrow undergoes sensorimotor testing with the VALD Performance team.View image in fullscreenSports biomechanist Kait Jackson and Joe Ernst, head of rider development at the PBR, watch as a rider captures his vertical jump for the VALD performance testing system.View image in fullscreenThe technology creates a benchmark simulation of each athlete, allowing them to see and address sport-specific weaknesses.“There’s a sense of being an outlaw, renegade, individualistic,” said Cody Custer, now 60, winner of the 1992 PRCA World Championship, and a teacher at the workshop. “I’m gonna just plug up and do my own thing and win this thing, as opposed to being oriented towards the organization, team sports, etc.”Rodeo athletes have traditionally come from ranching and farming families, which have always been medically under-served. These communities, says Champion, rarely went to the doctor and took pride in just “cowboying up” despite injuries or health issues. Young riders coming from these communities never expected, or received, much medical or performance-oriented care.“It was just a different way of thinking, no preparation, no taking care of your body, and if you’re hurt, sick or tired it doesn’t matter because being a cowboy is about being tough,” said Champion.View image in fullscreenPerformance coach Chase Dougherty tries to destabilize Dalton Dwyer on the bucking bull, a piece of training equipment meant to simulate the movement of a real bull.View image in fullscreenJose Ramirez grimaces during a strength drill.View image in fullscreenAttendees, most in their late teens and 20s, come from around the country to attend the five-day workshop.Photograph: Ilie MitaruView image in fullscreenMany rodeo athletes live out of their cars to save money.Rodeo athletes are largely freelancers, traveling on their own dime to competitions, hoping to place high enough to fund their next trip and entry fee. The vast majority of rodeo athletes still have day jobs.“Bull riding is a drug. It’s the most addictive thing that I’ve ever experienced in my entire life,” said Gabe Martin, 22, from Felton, Delaware, who works servicing public and residential ponds during the week and chases bull riding circuits on the weekend. “It’s engulfed my life and, and it seems I just can’t get away from it. “Optimal Performance Academy attracts young athletes from across the country to their week-long training camps. The workshops are a mix of theory and practice. The theory includes guidance on nutrition, attracting sponsors through social media, personal finance lessons, and goal-setting and visualization. The practice portion of the workshop includes performance testing, rodeo-specific workouts, practice on bucking machines and two days of live bull riding.View image in fullscreenThe riders take a moment for group prayer to ask for protection before the day’s riding begins.View image in fullscreen‘I think rodeo is stuck in tradition, and I think that people fear that with change will come loss of tradition,’ said Doug Champion, above, who founded Optimal Performance Academy in 2023.View image in fullscreenChampion partnered with a local stock contractor to bring 88 bulls that the riders will cycle through for the workshopFor their seventh-ever workshop in Decanter,Texas, Champion brought in an Australian pioneer in VALD, a type of performance testing which uses force plates, dynamometers, motion capture, and ocular and vestibular testing to measure a wide range of key metrics. The idea is to understand the strengths and weaknesses of each athlete, and then build personalized training programs off that data.This testing is ubiquitous across most professional and college level elite sports, but this is the first time it’s been used for amateur bull riders.View image in fullscreenWyatt Bowman falls off the back of a bull.View image in fullscreenRyan Jae, Braulio Barraza and  Jose Ramirez watch their fellow classmate.View image in fullscreenEd Huffman tries to untangle a rider’s leg from a raging bull.View image in fullscreenAlec Richardson celebrates a successful ride.“The biggest thing that we realized is nothing about rodeo that happens physically is normal or natural to the body. In no way shape or form through regular exercise patterns or everyday life are you going to improve your ability to perform in the arena,” said Champion.Champion, who was a promising young rider in his own right, broke his back in 2010 falling off a bronco. His long, painful road to recovery led him to realize how much more rodeo athletes could be doing to increase their strength and technique while riding, and build resilience to bounce back after injuries.“It was just get on as many horses as you can because if you get on more, you’ll figure it out sooner,” said Champion. “Well, I got on 300 horses and got my absolute dick slammed in the dirt every time and I didn’t learn anything.”View image in fullscreenAlec Richardson holds his knee in pain after a hard fall.View image in fullscreenA medical team and ambulance is on standby throughout the entire workshop.View image in fullscreenDalton Dwyer watches playback of his ride with a handful of coaches.Champion’s hope is to shorten the training time for young riders trying to break into the pro circuits, giving them more healthy years to compete and earn a living. Rodeo is notoriously brutal on the body, with most riders forced into retirement from injuries in their late 20s or early 30s.“It’s just a totally different approach than the trial by fire that has been the history of how you learn in rodeo,” said Champion.View image in fullscreenMatt Gordon takes a moment before his next ride.Explore more on these topicsSportThe Guardian picture essayPhotographyTexasUS sportsShareReuse this content"

For while Erpenbeck adopted some of the features of the form – apparently throwaway observations on daily life, such as minor irritation at the difficulty of sourcing propersplitterbrötchen, an unpretentious pastry now pimped for a more elaborate and wealthy clientele – she consistently enlarged and complicated it. Into that recognisable tone of ennui and mild querulousness with which journalists hope to woo a time-pressed but disenchanted or nostalgic readership, Erpenbeck smuggled metaphysics, politics and history.As in her fiction, her attention is drawn to the irrefutable power of contingency. As a child and adolescent, she was an East German; entering adulthood, she finds that her country no longer exists and that personal, family, social and political histories have been compressed into the suddenly appearing moment. If the collapse of the Berlin Wall was an easily grasped symbol, dramatic in its intensity and immediacy, what happened to the places and the people in the hours, days and years that followed? Put in more abstract philosophical terms, what is the status of an object after it has disappeared, a person after they have died, a renamed and reconfigured state, an altered identity?Contingency tells us that it depends. Thatsplitterbrötchen, for example: a sweet, plain item “rather jumbled up, as if the baker had stuck all the leftover scraps of dough together” is now a far more refined affair, involving layers of puff pastry, techniques and processes, a thumb pressed into the dough “to let air in”. “Air!?!” exclaims Erpenbeck. “For the first time, it strikes me that the worddisappearhas something active at its core, that there is a perpetrator in the word.”The pieces are necessarily short, and Erpenbeck leaves the reader to flesh out what she implies and only occasionally makes more explicit, as in the question of the disappearing drip-catcher – a once ubiquitous and low-tech gadget deployed to save East German tablecloths from coffee spills, now made obsolete as coffee pots have been replaced by Italian espresso-makers.These domestic concerns are inflected with irony and humour, but several of the pieces address larger and more significant absences. When Erpenbeck visits the site of the Warsaw Ghetto, describing the modern hotel where “glass elevators go up and down inside a glass tube” and chestnut trees flourish only in areas beyond the rebuilt zone, she reveals a memorable detail: that “there’s often a small slope to the right and left of the sidewalk, overgrown with grass and bushes, and the buildings themselves sit a bit higher”, because they have been constructed on the rubble and the foundations of old houses burnt to the ground by the Germans.‘They disappeared when the wall came down’: German author Jenny Erpenbeck on the objects that contain vast historiesRead moreWriting in miniature demands the exemplary and the material: something concrete to conjure a picture, to anchor a thought. But Erpenbeck is just as concerned with how such profound alterations affect intellect and emotion, how they redraw mental landscapes and interior life. Recalling people that she has lost – “R.”, whose fully charged shaver she collected from the hospital the day after his death, or her grandmother’s gnarled hands – she considers how her instinct to preserve is taking shape. She is forming a habit, she tells us, of trying to capture aspects of the “perfectly alive” people around her and imagining them as pieces of film, “as if I could select my memories in advance and learn them by heart, so that I could be sure to recall them later”.Things That Disappear: Reflections and Memories by Jenny Erpenbeck and translated by Kurt Beals is published by Granta (£12.99).

While maids a-milking, swans a-swimming and the rest might plausibly be found in English crime fiction’s favourite setting of a village, co-writers Humphrey Ker and David Reed set the deadly dozen in Victorian theatreland, where a performer embodying one of the song’s elements (Mother Goose, Swan Lake etc) is threatened each evening.The era allows the mayhem to be investigated by Sherlock Holmes and Dr Watson, played respectively by the authors, with Ker and Reed seeming to channel the tall-short, wild-mild dynamic of John Cleese and Andrew Sachs in Fawlty Towers.The show also impressively offers a Christmas gift that only the most curmudgeonly theatregoers would resist –a great musical drama duo reuniting. After Tim Rice and Andrew Lloyd Webber professionally separated in the early 1980s, they wrote Cricket (1986), a private “musicalette” for the 60th birthday of Elizabeth II, a new song for the 1996 movie of Evita, and bulked out the score and libretto of Arlen & Harburg’s The Wizard of Oz for Lloyd Webber’s 2011 staging. But the seven new songs here, plus a variation on one of the composer’s instrumental suite Variations (1978), are their most substantial resumption, facilitated by the producers including two of Rice’s children.View image in fullscreenGleefully theatrical … Sherlock Holmes and the 12 Days of Christmas at Birmingham Rep.Photograph: Pete Le MayPerhaps inevitably, the collaboration feels nostalgic. The show’s urchins and street traders overlap historically and in a music hall-style score with the Victorian setting of The Likes of Us, the 1965 Rice-Lloyd Webber debut show about Dr Barnardo that was not performed until 2005. The in-jokey and knowing tone of the lyrics (Rice clearly knows his Conan Doyle) recalls Cricket. As with that show, the Sherlock songs will be regarded as a Rice and Lloyd Webber curiosity. The best of them are The Dead of Winter, an atmospheric mashup of yuletide and homicidal references, and, scattering puns like spilled rice, Houses Are Not Holmes, a Watson solo affectingly delivered by Reed.Ride the Cyclone review – teens sing for their salvation in cult musicalRead moreThe script, staged with gusto by Phillip Breen and Becky Hope-Palmer, includes nice anachronistic jibes against sexism amid numerous meta jests about Birmingham’s football rivals Aston Villa, crime fiction and theatrical devices. In a sharp ensemble, Helena Wilson’s rival private detective Athena Faversham and Deborah Tracey’s Queen Victoria excel.This is a big moment for Rice: this week, I saw the Broadway revival ofChess, his 1986 collaboration with Abba songwriters, which was musically glorious but confused in storyline. Conversely, this venture has strong narrative from Ker and Reed with light grace notes from British musical theatre’s most profitable pair.AtBirmingham Repuntil 18 JanuaryExplore more on these topicsTheatreComedy (Stage)Comedy (Culture)Arthur Conan DoyleMusicalsAndrew Lloyd WebberTim RicereviewsShareReuse this content"

The Composer series at Sadler’s Wells presents a night of new choreography set to the work of a single composer and this time it’s the turn of AmericanNico Muhly, no stranger to the world of dance.Three very different choreographers tackle his music: Jules Cunningham, Maud Le Pladec and Michael Keegan-Dolan. The first two have broadly similar approaches. The dance listens closely to the endlessly imaginative textures of the score and chooses when to mimic – a shake of the knees to match a vibrato string, for example – and when to diverge.View image in fullscreenSlinky … Siaska Chareyre in Veins of Water by Maud Le Pladec.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianCunningham’s piece, Slant, is set to Muhly’s Drones, based on long, sustained string notes, which set up a sense of suspension (and suspense) that is a great foil for Cunningham’s stark movement, with its flat planes and improbable balances. It’s turned into something mysterious, liminal, unresolved. Cunningham’s six-strong cast includes two children and the incredible Ellen van Schuylenburch, who danced with Michael Clark in the 1980s and brings a dancing life’s worth of experience and mettle.Moving beyond bar lines: composer Nico Muhly on dancers reimagining his musicRead moreLe Pladec’s Veins of Water has three dancers who look as if they have forgotten to put their skirts on, in sheer shorts and glittery tops, waves of sequins matched by a wavy motif for the string instruments and the slinky movement of their jellyfish bodies. There’s an eerie glamour about them, like a 60s alien girl group. They shift from being enmeshed with the music to forging their own track, all the time looking us straight in the eye. Beguiling.You get comfortable with one approach and then Michael Keegan-Dolan turns everything upside down and says: come into my world! One where American folk singer Sam Amidon is standing on a stool with a noose hanging from the ceiling and the dancers appear as skeletons doing jazz hands. Muhly wrote The Only Tune for Amidon in 2007, based on Scots murder ballad The Two Sisters. The simple folk tune is stretched out, blurred at all its edges and vividly coloured in (played by the Britten Sinfonia, also skeletons). Amidon is a still, constant presence amid the madness and it’s pure theatre, with a beating heart, an arched brow and a wicked glint in its eye. A show that’s worth waiting five years for.AtSadler’s Wells, London, until 22 NovemberExplore more on these topicsDanceSadler's WellsNico MuhlyreviewsShareReuse this content"

But Pollyfromthedirt’s jagged pastoral pop demands more than just a passing scroll. Released independently this week, the County Durham native’s first EP clashes brass band samples, shuddering Midi strings and awkward acoustic guitar together. There’s a trace of Elliott Smith in his grey-skied songwriting, yet made entirely his own by the crude drum machines, pitched-up vocals and DIY production. At best, like the EP’s weirdest track, Kalm, the music departs from traditional song structure and coalesces into delay-steeped, swirling ambience.He doesn’t share his real name and often performs masked, channelling a healthy dollop of Dean Blunt in both vibe and sound. His most immediate peers, though, might be his fellow UK vanguards Worldpeace DMT,Westside CowboyandAya. His witty realism cuts through in a crowded scene: new song Theres No Such Thing as England subtly riffs on the country’s growing right-wing nationalism as a metaphor for jilted romance and suburban bleakness – “There’s no such thing as England / There’s no such thing as us to me” – while A Weekend in Majorca lets those same feelings dissolve on a classic package holiday: “I’m a lover, I’m a brawler / For a weekend in Majorca.”His descriptions of cold nights, broken-down cars, weird neighbours and teenage escapism all feel foggily familiar – attempts to reconfigure the frayed edges of memory from nostalgia into something new.Archie FordeThis week’s best new tracksView image in fullscreenHen Ogledd: Rhodri Davies, Dawn Bothwell, Sally Pilkington and Richard Dawson.Hen Ogledd – Scales Will FallFeaturing a splenetic rap from Dawn Bothwell that decries today’s political leadership as feudal, followed by the heartiest of choruses and a bracing trumpet freakout, this is an invigorating anthem from the UK psych-poppers.BBTFine – Moment“Sometimes I call you up in the moment,” the Dane sings, impetuously – but her slowcore, country-Mazzy Star-ish ballad, made for the final souls on the dancefloor, burns steadier, waiting for them to come to her.LSTems– What You NeedThe Nigerian star lets the astonishing timbre of her voice sit out front in this ballad as she calls time on a crisis-strewn relationship: “Your love is like an endless sea: it won’t lead me anywhere.”BBTLucinda Williams–We’ve Come Too Far to Turn Around (ft Norah Jones)The union of these two powerhouse singers suggests an Americana take on VH1’s old Divas format, as they warble about straying from the path to choogling Hammond organ and stately piano.LSConverge – Love is Not EnoughThe returning metalcore pioneers argue for a more combative, less doveish attitude when dealing with society’s ghouls, but don’t shy from self-examination either: “We must grow to stomach the taste of our own blood”​.BBTHaley Heynderickx and Max García Conover – To Each Their Dot“And if I look at you and your rage as testicular / Humanity’s best interest is circular,” Heynderickx sings, tempering her rage in this folksy lament about man acting against his best interest.LSSvalbard – If We Could Still Be SavedAfter terrific albums such as The Weight of the Mask and When I Die, Will I Get Better?, this metalcore epic is the Bristol band’s final song. “Think of it as the metal version of Goodbye by the Spice Girls!”, says frontwoman Serena Cherry.BBTSubscribe to the Guardian’s rolling Add to Playlist selections on Spotify – or transfer it toApple,Tidalor other services.Explore more on these topicsMusicAdd to playlistfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Sift the flour, baking powder, bicarb and salt into a medium bowl. Put the butter, sugar and orange zest in the bowl of an electric mixer and beat with the paddle attachment on medium-high until pale and creamy. Add the eggs one at a time and beat in well – the mix may curdle at this point, but don’t worry: it will come back together.Beat in the vanilla, then, on low speed, add the sifted dry ingredients in three instalments, alternating with the soured cream. Scrape the base and sides of the bowl a few times with a flexible spatula to ensure the batter is evenly mixed, then spoon the batter over the cranberries in the tin. Use a spatula to smooth out the top evenly.Put the tin on an oven tray and bake for about 50 minutes, until a skewer inserted into the centre of the cake comes out clean. Transfer the cake in its tin to a wire rack and leave to cool for at least 30 minutes.Carefully invert the cake on to a platter, then peel away and discard the baking paper.

The table was set with giant clam shells for serving vessels and miniature hibachis for grilling Dungeness crab. Somebody had found a small, pink pineapple and secured it on the watermelon like a brooch. The hostess considered the merits of a hula dancer, but in the end settled on a more succinct spectacle: a 19lb suckling pig, enwreathed with sub-tropical flowers and caparisoned in bronze.It was, and could only ever have been, aMartha Stewartaffair. This was before the media empire, in more innocent days, when Stewart was a caterer in Connecticut. She was brilliant even then. It takes a spark of something dazzling, even dangerous, to notice a single detail – an orchid, say – and from this to extrapolate a 20-person luau. A while later, Stewart wrote about the party in Entertaining, her 1982 cookbook debut, lushly photographed and with step-by-step instructions for chicken wings with banana. “The pig wore a necklace of starfruit,” she explained. It speaks to Stewart’s generational talent for nonsense that this isn’t even in the top 10 wildest sentences in the book.View image in fullscreenA Hawaiian feast with suckling pig from Martha Stewart’s 1982 book Entertaining.Photograph: Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia, LPI have been thinking a lot about Entertaining recently. Last year I bought a bargain first edition on eBay, ostensibly in the name of serious research. I was mesmerised. It is, in short, the greatest work of literature on entertaining ever written – a cookbook, technically, but in reality something stranger and more opaque. Stewart is a master of far-out wisdom. For those without a large dining room, why not set up a couple of small, round tables in the bedroom with table linen to match the bedsheets? The evening will be enlivened by the implicit threat that it could turn, upon some imperceptible social undercurrent, into a swingers’ party. If you don’t care for fussy trinkets, you might choose a table centrepiece of a single huge Bermuda onion, or “a convoluted brown tree fungus in which [to] fix a delicate branch or a bloom”. Think about it. Be prepared. You could consider hiring a balalaika player to soundtrack a Russian-themed dinner party, or borrow a silver samovar from friends.The problems with Stewart are many and predictable. Yes, she is out of touch. She represents the worst of striving Waspy hostess culture. These recipes – the goblets of borscht, the turkey-shaped madeleines – are unrealistic for the ordinary cook. I know these grievances because they are the grievances I have had with Stewart, with all people for whom entertaining is an ambassadorial affair. And yet it is all so spectacularly beside the point to approach Stewart along these lines, like chastising the moon for its eerie, beautiful light.The trouble is, we’ve resented entertaining for as long as we’ve had the luxury of doing it. About a century ago we invented cocktail parties, a smart workaround for sit-down dinner parties that ensured we could spend less time and more money eating worse food with people we don’t like. By the 1950s, with cocktail parties and their backlash in full force, writers made up solutions like after-dinner wine parties and sitting-room dinner parties.Now, in the long shadow of the dinner party mania of the 1980s we avoid such words altogether. Instead we have people over, in the breezy, Alison Roman-inspired way,her delightful cookbookshaving become standard setters for anti-ostentatious taste. Now it’s Le Creuset dishes, not silver samovars, that signal a certain coy tastefulness. This is how things work: action, reaction, the timeless art of feeding people changing as fashion dictates. But I have to wonder whether, in our desire to never repeat the crimes of the 80s, we have overcorrected – whether we have thrown the starfruit-necklaced piglet out with the bathwater.Among the postmodern elements of Stewart-style entertaining, there is a truth that we often forget: that entertaining, in whatever form it takes, should befun. This is the entire point. Fun is not the same as casualness. It is not the same as ease. Fun comes from recognising that entertaining at home can and should be different to the usual order of things, which is why Stewart’s advocacy for tempura parties, omelette brunches for 60 and dinners of half a dozen varieties of soup delight me so much. They are reminders that great entertaining comes not from trying to replicate a restaurant at home, but imagining the whimsical, fantastical, unmarketable feasts that any serious establishment would never dare.View image in fullscreenOne of Martha Stewart’s tempura parties.Photograph: Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia, LPThis U-turn on my part has been electrifying. Out with the sincere, in with the absurd. I have been recommending Entertaining – a cookbook from which I will surely never cook – to anyone who will listen. There are lessons to be learned here, I tell people. There are visions that only a true seer could decode, like “Neoclassic Dinner for Eight to Ten”. I’ve done this safe in the knowledge that most people will never actually be able to get a copy, those rare old books now being collector’s items that go for hundreds of dollars. But this year, 43 years since it was first published and into a general political climate not so different from the 80s in which it was conceived, Entertaining has just been rereleased. It is a new printing for a new generation of culinary fantasists. “Cook remaining 100 lobsters,” Stewart tells us, in one of the most spectacular lines ever written in English, in or outside a cookbook. It is the best, worst influence on cooking any of us could have dreamed.Ruby Tandoh’s All Consuming is published by Serpent’s Tailat £18.99.

This week’s sudden drop in temperature has our house excited for potential snow (the children are giddy), with everything suddenly feeling a lot more wintry. New coats are on the hooks, thermals are being dug out and a casserole dish filled with some sort of soup, stew or stock seems to be permanently ticking away on the hob. These range from quick, warming weeknight dinners to leisurely, slow-cooked weekend meals.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Whatever the time of year, I always have speedy packets of wontons and gyozas in the freezer, and cook them depending on how I feel (fried and steamed versus boiled and soupy). At the moment, I am craving warmth and nourishment, andMeera Sodha’s quickish vegan wonton souphits all the right spots; an added bonus is that it is a soup my children can get on board with, too. I rely on mybrothy braised chicory and beans(pictured top) to get me through working-from-home lunches, when I don’t have much time, as well as Rukmini Iyer’sspiced black bean and tomato soup, which is equally speedy and comforting.View image in fullscreenQuick and easy … Rukmini Iyer’s spiced black bean and tomato soup with avocado and lime.Photograph: Matthew Hague/The GuardianIf we have roasted a chicken on a Sunday, I always make stock with the bones that same evening, andMandy Yin’s recipe for chicken curry laksais the perfect way of honouring that liquid gold. Her laksas are one of my favourite things to devour on a chilly day, so I’m thrilled that she has shared her secrets with us, and that I can now make and devour them from the comfort of my own home.At the weekend, I cook heartier stews – and, if time allows, even indulge in a little meal prep. Any ofthese stews by Gill Mellerwould be welcome; I plan to start by making the chicken, chorizo, white bean, olive and preserved lemon number. And I have already shopped forFelicity Cloake’s perfect Irish stew, for my half-Irish husband and lamb-loving kids, picking up an extra-large jar of pickled red cabbage to go on the side. On a day when I know my extended family will pop over, I will giveRachel Roddy’s “sociable” fish stewa go, due at least in part to the number of pescatarians in our midst. While I appreciate that the name references the stew’s history and creation, rather than a claim on its ability, it’s worth a try, right? I love the idea of a hearty fish stew bringing everyone together on a cold winter day.My week in foodView image in fullscreenThe late, great Rachel Cooke.Photograph: Sophia Evans/The ObserverWhat I’m reading|I was never fortunate enough to meet Rachel Cooke, but was heartbrokento hear of her death. Like many food lovers, I adored her writing and witty observations about the culinary world, chefs, restaurants and more. Cooke’s 2023 bookKitchen Person: Notes on Cooking & Eatingcontains 50 of the best entries from her much-loved column in the Observer, and is a wonderful way to revisit her work.A touch of glass|I am a sucker for beautiful serve-ware, and am smitten with all of Ichendorf Milano’s elegant, whimsical glassware. Even just one piece would bring so much joy to any dining table. Thegiraffe and baobab jugis already on my Christmas list, as is thetomato tumblerthat I would love to live on my bedside table. Both are from Sous Chef, but you can also find Ichendorf stocked in many other places, includingJohn LewisandFortnum & Mason.My next meal out|Ever since I first tried Amy Poon’s home-delivery wontons back in lockdown in 2021, I have hungrily followed her journey from those wontons toaward-winning Chinese deli productsand restaurant pop-ups. She now hasa more permanent home, Poon’s, in the stunning surroundings of Somerset House in central London, and I cannot wait to try the entire menu. I’m particularly intrigued by thesiu yeh, which she describes as “a late-night meal in the food culture of southern China”.

You use the same pan to cook the rice and vegetables before adding fillets of cod, which are then steamed to perfection.The seasonal vegetables from the Tesco Finest range add a burst of colour to this dish and bring lovely layers of flavour – the rainbow carrots are sweet and vibrant and the cavolo nero, rich and peppery. The Tesco Finest wild cod loins are delicate and flaky, and topped with umami-rich miso butter. The whole thing is infused with sesame and ginger, making this a fragrant winter treat.Prep30 minCook50 minServes44 Tesco Finest skinless and boneless cod loins70g Tesco Finest West Country butter,softened1 tbsp white miso1 tsp mirin2 tbsp sesame oil3 Tesco Finest echalion shallots,thinly sliced2 garlic cloves,thinly sliced50g piece ginger,peeled and cut into matchsticks100g Tesco Finest cavolo nero,shredded175g Tesco Finest rainbow carrots,trimmed and peeled into strips200g basmati rice400ml water2 tbsp light soy sauce2 tbsp sesame seeds,toasted2 spring onions,shreddedLime wedges,to serveSuggested wine pairingTesco Finest AssyrtikoShopper buttonView image in fullscreenIn a bowl stir together the softened butter, miso and mirin, then set aside.On a hob, heat a lidded, deep oven-proof frying pan and toast the sesame seeds until golden, then set aside.
