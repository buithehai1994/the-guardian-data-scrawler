Or did they just get sick of all the scandal?Mark LawsonThu 23 Oct 2025 12.24 EDTLast modified on Thu 23 Oct 2025 21.30 EDTShareWhen long-serving presenters leave a seemingly timeless franchise, two questions immediately arise. Why are they going? And who will replace them?On the first point, the BBC will hope that the joint departure of Claudia Winkleman and Tess Daly fromStrictly Come Dancingwill be attributed to longevity – Daly has served a 21-year term, Winkleman 11 as a main co-host – and the impact on family life of a weekend gig.Yet if diaries and tiredness were the primary reason for the hosts going, it would have been more likely to be announced much closer to the December end of season 23. This weekend’s shows are only the fifth week of 13.Rylan, Alison Hammond ... Bill Bailey? Who could possibly replace Claudia and Tess on Strictly?Read moreAnd it cannot be denied – though theBBCwould wish it could – that the appeal of spending 13 Saturday late nights with would-be hoofers in Elstree may have been reduced by almost two years of scandals or allegations about the alleged behaviour, language or favoured stimulants of some participants in the show. These headlines have not affected the presenters, but if you dance with a skunk, it will affect your own scent. At a certain point, agents would worry about contamination by association.The question also arises in any host-show relationship about the balance of dependency and, for Winkleman in particular, there can be no doubt that the show now needs her more than she needs it. She also fronts The Traitors, the BBC’s biggest entertainment hit since Strictly, and with that series likely to expand in its stranger and star versions, she has even more pressure on her calendar.View image in fullscreenTess Daly and Claudia Winkleman on Strictly Come Dancing: 20 Fabulous Years.Photograph: Screen Grab/BBC StudiosOn the second question, however, of who Daly and Winkleman’s successors might be, I would not recommend punting your life’s savings on anyone in particular.Without any insider knowledge on this point, it intrigues me that the BBC’s statement that “plans for the next series will be announced in due course” can be seen as leaving open the possibility that there won’t be a 24th series of Strictly Come Dancing, or at least not next year.There is a parallel here with another BBC One juggernaut. Strictly Come Dancing and Doctor Who have always made interesting schedule fellows because each is a superior reboot of a 20th-century show – Come Dancing (1950-98) and the original Doctor Who (1963-89) – and in their second incarnations they are less than a year apart in age: Strictly launched on 15 May 2004, and the new Who on 26 March 2005. Two decades later, both find themselves in limbo, having lost their main performers and with no details of the next run confirmed after BBC statements that leave existential questions open.The argument that the BBC could not end such recognisable shows assumes that TV hits run for ever. They don’t.Some, like fish or other perishable foodstuffs, suddenly go off. In the late 1990s, Noel’s House Party, which had made Noel Edmonds a BBC One Saturday night ratings topper, suddenly lost half its audience and all of its media interest. In other cases, presenters and network lose their creative energy. Ant & Dec’s Saturday Night Takeaway, ITV’s main weekend entertainment rival to Strictly Come Dancing, was suspended for the foreseeable future earlier this year.If there exists any possibility that Strictly Come Dancing might join Ant & Dec and The Doctor on such hiatus, then Claudia and Tess would be sensible to separate their own departure and tributes to them from any subsequent coverage of the whole show.With ratings above 6 million – lower than before but higher than most other terrestrial programmes in an era defined by streamers – stopping the dancing would be a bold call, but with a sense that some hostile media outlets may be targeting the show week after week for bad news, the BBC may decide that it and the production team need a break.As any 2026 schedule with a Strictly gap or restructuring would surely foreground The Traitors even more, Winkleman is in a winning position. The world of comedy suggests that the breakup of a double-act can disadvantage one former partner more than the other, so transition is important for Daly. It would be a surprise, even professional negligence, if no Winkle-Tess podcast emerges.Explore more on these topicsStrictly Come DancingClaudia WinklemanTelevisionReality TVEntertainment TVBBCfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Armed with a provocative new slogan, the company reveals the innovations and strategy it hopes will turn its reputation aroundBySean Inglein Beaverton, OregonThu 23 Oct 2025 09.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 23 Oct 2025 21.30 EDTShareThe entrance to Nike’s swish global headquarters in Beaverton, Oregon is paved with rough cobbles, designed to remind employees to watch their step when they go forward.Last summer, though, not even the world’s biggest sports brand could stop itself from taking an almighty tumble.Over the course of one July day in 2024, Nike’s share price plummeted by $28bn – the worst single-day performance in the company’s history – after it revealed that second-quarter sales were down 10%.There were headlines proclaiming that Nike was in crisis. That it had lost its cool, become either too woke, too safe, too conservative or too cumbersome, depending on their political stripe and reading of the situation. To no one’s surprise, its chief executive, John Donahoe, stepped down.True, Nike was still worth around $100bn – more than twice the value of its closest rival, Adidas, and even further clear of Puma, Lululemon and New Balance. And, yes, the cost of living crisis didn’t help. But much of the pain was self-inflicted.Just over a year later I am sitting with Nike’s new president and chief executive, Elliott Hill, talking about how he intends to turn the company around with the help of some wild new innovations, including the world’s first motor-powered running and walking shoe.View image in fullscreenNike has put a greater emphasis on innovation of late, developing products such as self-inflating coats, skin-cooling T-shirts and shoes that influence your state of mind.Photograph: NikeSoon I will also hear about “mind shoes” that help Erling Haaland focus before matches, a self-inflating winter jacket that Team USA will wear at the Winter Olympics and technology that aims to help England’s footballers at the World Cup. Before then, though, I throw Hill – a huge soccer and baseball fan – a curveball. Might Nike’s recent kicking actually turn out to be a good thing? Both for consumers, who now have more choice from upstart brands such as On and Hoka, and for his company – as it has forced it to raise its game?Hill laughs, then leans in. “Trust me, I would have preferred not to go through the kicking,” he says. “And this one happens to be a pretty big kicking. But I do think it helps us refocus on why we exist, and is a rallying cry for us as a company. I think it helps us get sharper. We’re at our best when we’re competing. And not only competing, but competing and winning.”Hill’s answer is open, honest and authentic: a face that Nike hasn’t always shown to outsiders. And the 62-year-old is just as direct when it comes to his plans to turn the company round using sport and trusting in new ideas.“On my first day, I stood up on stage and my first slide said we are a sport company and we are a growth company, and they’re not mutually exclusive,” he says. “And when we invite eight billion consumers into the world of sport, I like our chances of growing.“I know it sounds simplistic,” adds Hill, who joined Nike as an intern in 1988 and came back last October having retired in 2020. “But the response from around the world was: OK, we’re back to sport. We exist to serve the athletes. And when we do that well, that usually translates into innovative products, emotional storytelling, and then it pays off at retail.”Nike share priceInternally Nike is signalling that fresh direction with a six-word mission statement: “Create Epic Shit, Make Athletes Better.”It is provocative and bombastic. In other words, classic Nike. But, as Phil McCartney, Nike’s chief innovation, design and product officer, explains, it is also a tribute to one of its most famous athletes.“Create epic shit is something that we got from Kobe Bryant,” he says. “He used to walk the halls here and say: ‘Are you creating epic shit?’ It’s a standard of excellence. It has a bit of an attitude to it. And we’re already starting to use it when we look at our innovations. Is it that? If it’s not, then we shouldn’t do it.”View image in fullscreenKobe Bryant provided the inspiration for Nike’s new internal mission statement.Photograph: Mark J Terrill/APNot so long ago, McCartney, who grew up in Wallsend in the north-east of Englandand was once a talented Great Britain runner, remembers an acquaintance telling him that the brand had become “big, dumb and slow”.“And it sort of struck a chord with a lot of us,” he says. “Because that’s not who we are, it’s not how we want to operate. And it’s definitely not our future.”‘Nobody here is crazy. We just live in the future’Later that morning I am standing outside Nike’s LeBron James Innovation Center, a 750,000-square-foot facility which has 400 motion-capture cameras, nearly 100 force plates and male and female sweat-testing dummies, waiting to stare into that future.First I put on a normal-looking pair of super shoes. Then I attach a prototype device containing a motor to my ankles, calves and the shoes themselves. After that, a senior Nike biomechanical engineer, Alison Sheets, presses a button, and the device starts to whirr and fit more snuggly around my legs.Sean Ingle tries out the prototype Project Amplify shoesSean Ingle tries out the prototype Project Amplify shoes.I feel like RoboCop, and initially when I walk I move like him too. But when I start running and Alison ramps up the power via an app, I suddenly turn into Forrest Gump. Despite very little effort, I am running far quicker than my effort level – and my mind – tells me I should be.It is more than a little weird. But also a whole lot of fun. Incredibly, at one point I jog up the 150-metre ramp on Nike’s campus which has a 15.63% incline – without being remotely out of breath. (If evidence didn’t exist, I wouldn’t blame you for wondering which substances in downtown Portland I had been inhaling.)“We’re actually putting a robot on your body,” explains Michael Donaghu, Nike’s VP of create the future, emerging sport and innovation. “And we want that robot to be your best friend.”The Project Amplify shoesNike likens its Project Amplify shoes to an ebike for feet.What makes all this even harder to compute is that I happen to have been hobbling around with a heavily bruised little toe. Yet the shoe seems to take most of the impact off the joint, like an anti-gravity treadmill, allowing me to run with only minor pain.Nike calls this motorised shoe Project Amplify and likens it to an ebike for feet, allowing the general population – rather than serious runners – to run or walk far quicker than they otherwise would do.How much quicker? In testing, the company’s researchers found that athletes experienced anywhere from a 9-22% improvement in metabolic effort. In other words, like going from a 12-minute mile to a 10-minute mile, using the same effort.Donaghu says that Nike engineers had been working on various iterations of the device for years, but it was Hill’s return that made it happen. “We sat down, pitched him on what the idea was and unflinchingly, he was like: ‘This is absolutely what Nike should be about,’” he says. “Nobody here is crazy. We just live in the future and have bigger dreams.”View image in fullscreenThe 15.63% incline ramp outside the LeBron James Innovation Centre.Photograph: Nike‘Footwear construction can influence how the mind works’At next summer’s men’s World Cup, Nike’s sponsored teams, including England, the USA and Brazil, will be wearing kits with a new Aero-Fit material which – Nike says – will allow players to feel cool even in very hot and humid conditions. For good measure it is also made from 100% textile waste.Before then it will release the Air Milano, a jacket that inflates in 30 seconds and can generate warmth levels that range from a lightweight hoodie to a mid-level puffer and which will be worn by Team USA at the Winter Olympics.View image in fullscreenThe Air Milano jacket will be worn by Team USA at the Winter OlympicsPhotograph: NikeFinally there is the Nike Mind, a shoe and slider that contain cushioning nodes which press on the sensors in the feet and – the company says – improve focus when worn.Haaland, the Manchester City striker, and WNBA basketball star A’ja Wilson have been using the shoe, which took nearly a decade to develop, to prepare for matches. Nike insists it has the science to back up its claims.View image in fullscreenErling Haaland in the Nike Mind footwear.Photograph: Nike“Using tools like EEG, we’ve measured changes in brain activity linked to focus and presence,” says Matthew Nurse, the company’s chief science officer. “That’s the first time we’ve been able to show – and prove – that footwear construction can influence how the mind works.”However, Donaghu, who joined Nike in the late 80s and even worked with the co-founder Bill Bowerman, insists this is just the start.“We’re like kids in a candy store here,” he says. “And there’s something really magical going on. We sweat getting it right. And worry about making money later. That’s a lesson we learned from Bill Bowerman. Phil Knight [Nike’s other co-founder] really did care about building a company that was solvent and could make money.“Bill Bowerman didn’t give a shit about making money. He just wanted to make athletes good. I love having both of those angels on our shoulders.”Part of the success, he adds, comes from Nike having an innovation kitchen – a place he describes as “very non-hierarchical playground” – where about 30 people from all parts of the company throw ideas around.“We’re the kids that want to know the things that others just have hunches about,” he says. “Oh, we don’t have a mind scientist? We’re going to hire a mind scientist in the kitchen. That’s how we push the ball forward.”‘There will be moments when we get it wrong’Nike has invited the Guardian to Beaverton to unveil its new innovations, but also to show the outside world that it is changing. And so towards the end of our conversation I ask Hill about Allyson Felix, one of America’s greatest Olympians, who in 2019 revealed Nike’s threat to cut her pay by 70% if motherhood affected her future athletic performance. Three months later Nike changed its stance to guarantee athlete’s pay and bonuses for 18 months around pregnancy, and three other brands soon followed suit.I also mention the former Nike Oregon Project coach, Alberto Salazar, who wasgiven a four-year doping suspension in 2019and then a lifetime ban for sexual and emotional misconduct, issued by the US Center for SafeSport.View image in fullscreenAllyson Felix revealed Nike proposed to cut her pay by 70% if motherhood affected her future athletic performance.Photograph: Ryan Pierse/Getty ImagesEvery company makes mistakes. But Nike has made a lot down the years without always owning up to them. Will it really be different under his watch?“I think that consumers today want companies to be more vulnerable, authentic, real and upfront,” Hill replies. “And here’s what I would say as the leader of this company. The entire world has my commitment to be real – about the situations when we get it right, and then there will be moments when we get it wrong. That’s just inevitable in the world of business. But I think it’s how we respond in those moments when we get it wrong that matters most.”Hill is more guarded when it comes to discussing Donald Trump’s tariffs, which will cost the company about $1.5bn this year. But is there anything Nike can do to alleviate the burden?“We have a pretty diverse global supply chain and expenses, and we’re pulling all the levers,” he says. “But my hope is that it doesn’t impact the world of sport.“Because if you think about it, it’s not just Nike. It is helmet manufacturers, baseball bats, equipment, and it all trickles down to the consumer. The accessibility of sports today is already challenged, and I think it will make it even more challenging for the average American. That’s the part that I’m nervous about.”View image in fullscreenNike’s new president and chief executive, Elliott Hill.Photograph: NikeBefore travelling to the US, I spoke to a couple of former Nike employees who both had positive things to say about Hill. One even insisted, somewhat implausibly, that when he was appointed last October, people literally cried with relief.Certainly something had to be done to turn around the company’s fortunes. For years analysts had warned that Nike was relying too much on colour variations of older favourites – especially Jordans, Dunks and Air Forces – like a classic 80s rock station spinning the same old tunes even when the hype has faded.Meanwhile, Nike put a huge amount of focus on direct-to-consumer sales – meaning that fewer of its products were in stores.That allowed the likes of Hoka, On, and others to move in. And when the new wave of runners, often women in their 20s and 30s, flocked to join run crews after the pandemic they often turned to those brands first.Since returning to Nike, Hill has focused on rebuilding relationships with retailers, with one of its largest customers, JD Sports, saying last month that Nike was “doing all the right things” to revive demand.Hill has also gone back to having separate departments for each sport, such as running, football and basketball – as opposed to Donahoe, who organised things by men’s, women’s and kids’ categories which led to bottlenecks when it came to innovation. Now, Hill says, teams are quicker to react and get products to market.View image in fullscreenNike now have a mind scientist working at the LeBron James Innovation Centre.Photograph: NikeView image in fullscreenNike is determined to put athletes ‘at the centre of everything we do’.Photograph: NikeHe concedes that there is still plenty of work ahead. But in its recent earnings report there were some green shoots, with a number of well-received releases helping the running division grow by over 20% in the last quarter.‘It didn’t hurt that Spain was an Adidas team’Football is also a huge passion for Hill, who was raised by a single mum in a blue-collar neighbourhood in Texas. In fact such was his love of the game he made a small investment in the Italian Serie B side Venezia when he initially retired in 2020, only to give it up when he returned to Nike last year.Hill also remembers being “completely blasted” by some of his European colleagues in 1998 when he suggested they could do more to promote the women’s game. “They were like: ‘No one cares about women’s football.’ And then fast forward to today, almost 30 years later, and it’s phenomenal.”As we chat he casts his mind back to the Women’s Euros this summer.During the finalhe sat with Football Association officials with England 1-0 down against Spain and looking like they had nothing left in the tank.“I was yelling at them: ‘We’ve got to believe,’” he says. “Because you can just see it with the English. They’ve had their hearts broken so many times, especially in those big moments, and never winning one outside of the country, right? You can see it. So I literally started to yell at them: “Come on everybody, let’s go, come on, we got this.’View image in fullscreenGeorgia Stanway (left) and Alessia Russo celebrate England’s Women’s Euro success in Switzerland.Photograph: Maja Hitij/Uefa/Getty Images“And then, of course, when we won – everybody, the joy! And that’s the beauty of sport,” adds Hill, who says he wants Nike to absorb the lessons from the Lionesses’ resilience. “It’s those moments that define an athlete, a team, a country, and in our case, a company. And it didn’t hurt that Spain was an Adidas team.”Before I leave Oregon I speak to Tony Bignell, a Briton who was a key figure in Eliud Kipchoge’sBreaking2marathon project and Faith Kipyegon’sBreaking4mile attempt as well as the gamechanging super shoes that powered them, and is now Nike’s chief innovation officer. The company, he insists, is getting back on track despite a few “dramas” in recent years.“It’s hard sometimes when you’re trying to help an elite athlete as well as somebody like my mum, who wants to walk the dog around the block,” he says. “But under Elliott the handbrake is off, and we feel loose. It’s amazing how one person can make that difference.”“I wish more people could understand the people in this building because they’re not corporate, whatever you might read about Nike,” he adds. “It’s just a good human place to be.” Somewhat ironically a company that tells stories better than most has often failed to get this across.Meanwhile to the outsider it also seems like there are multiple Nikes. The sports brand that wants to win at all costs, and sometimes takes it too far. The global multinational with 80,000 employees, watching every flicker of its share price. The company that is trying to stay endlessly cool. And the day-to-day numerous super-smart scientists, engineers, and other employees who will happily shoot the breeze, praise rivals and be open about the state of the company.However, Hill insists that, when you dig into its soul, Nike remains the company set up in 1972 by Knight (the campus in Beaverton has just been renamed in his honour) and Bowerman. The one that was propelled to glory by elevating athletes such as Steve Prefontaine and Michael Jordan, along with a series of innovations that began when Knight began creating shoes with his waffle maker, and selling them out of his Winnebago.“Those two started this company on a handshake,” says Hill. “They each put $500 in. And they had a simple purpose: we exist to serve the athlete and to put them at the centre of everything we do.”More than five decades much has changed. But one time-worn formula remains the same: Create Epic Shit, Make Athletes Better. Keep consumers in love with the Swoosh. Reap the rewards.View image in fullscreenA prototype of the Project Amplify shoes.Photograph: NikeExplore more on these topicsAthleticsNikefeaturesShareReuse this content"

You there. The foreign looking one. I can see you. Don’t try to sneak away and hide. Your time is up. We’ve had enough of you. And don’t try to play the racist card. It’s nothing to do with the colour of your skin. I hate everyone who isn’t British. What’s that? You have indefinite leave (ILR) to remain? Well, not any more you don’t. Look. It’s not personal. It’s just that you’re notculturally coherent. If you get my drift. You somehow don’t look right. Smell funny. You don’t fit in.Welcome to the new Compassionate Conservatism. Remember the old days? Theresa May’s hostile environment. Home Office vans driving around towns with a sign telling immigrants to bugger off home. Sometimes you can be just too nice. Well, those days of sweet-talking foreigners are over. It’s now clear they aren’t going to leave of their own free will, so the time has come for mass deportations. Enough is enough. Send in the ICE squads now.Speak to people inside the Tory party and they will tell you that Katie Lam, the Kent MP who was first elected to parliament last year, is one of their rising stars. Ear-marked for greatness.A future leader. She is already a junior whip, though that’s not particularly remarkable: there are so few Conservative MPs almost everyone gets to do something meaningless. Still, take it from those who care about these things: a Star is Born. Whether this tells you more about the abject state of the Tory party or Katie is for you to decide.First, some background. After a few years at Goldman Sachs – the financial services firm dodged a bullet when she left – Katie went on to become a special adviser to Boris Johnson. She can clearly pick a winner. Safe to assume there’s nothing she doesn’t know about how to enjoy illegal parties during lockdown and how to lie through your teeth. Let’s just say that she might not be the best judge of character.Next Tory leader? Rise of Katie Lam reflects rightward shift on migrationRead moreThat’s not all. Katie has apparently also written eight musicals. Her ninth, currently in pre-production, is believed to be a mashup of The Sound of Music. A feelgood show in which a group of young children and their nanny try to flee repression by entering a country illegally. Katie loves an upbeat ending so the Swiss then reject their asylum claims and send them all back to generously appointed prison camps. Where they all die happily ever after.Now here’s the thing. Katie is also a committed Brexiter so you might have thought she would have noticed that Boris had had an open doors immigration policy during the three years he was prime minister. But Katie didn’t say a word. Because what the British people had voted for was whatever Boris chose to do next. Yet, she is nothing if not entirely inconsistent. For since she has been a sitting MP Katie has made it her mission to deport as many people as possible.Spare a thought forRobert Jenrickhere. Honest Bob has made it his life’s work to make the most toxic, divisive statements possible. Anything to get the attention of racists. And he was doing so well. All traces of his former life as a liberal, remainer MP have been almost eradicated. And then up pops Katie to completely outclass him on the nastiness scale. Makes him look like a good-natured one nation Tory. It’s just not fair. But it won’t be easy for him to recover the low ground.Over the last week or so Katie has been sharing her views on immigration with anyone who will listen. In interviews and on X. And the main takeaway is that no one is safe. Even if you are legally here and have been given ILR, you are still in the firing line for being deported. It’s not personal, she insists. She isn’t blaming those who came here in good faith, filled in every form and followed the legal immigration procedures. It’s just that the rules had been wrong so – and she says this more in pleasure than in anger – many people who have made a home in Britain will have to go. Sayonara motherfuckers.“It’s all about ‘cultural coherence’,” says Katie. Definitely not racist, that. Keep Britain for the British. Just not the foreign British. Coming over here with their foreign foods and foreign ways. No wonder Britain has been going to the dogs. That and Brexit. Who mentioned Brexit? You can be first to leave. Everyone must go. Anyone who doesn’t look like us, think like us or speak like us. That includes anyone from the EU. Don’t think you get a free ride. Even if you married a Brit.Keeping up with everyone that Katie hates is hard work. She doesn’t want any foreigners who have been given state benefits. So any woman with ILR who took statutory maternity pay can go for a start. Even if it means splitting up families. Be careful, Kemi. She’s coming for you. Hurry up. Piss off. Katie doesn’t have all day.She also wants anybody legally here earning less than £38,700 to jog on. That’s most nurses working in the NHS. Spongers all of them. Katie just wants people who are going to make a net financial contribution to the country. So she is also open to raising taxes for the lowest paid. You can’t beat that level of genius.Nor is Katie on her own with this. She is merely the most prominent and most vocal. Riding the waves. She is the one who lives and breathes this stuff. Believes in a deportation scheme that makes Idi Amin expelling hundreds of thousands of Asians from Uganda look reasonable. For all of this was the quarter-witted Chris Philp’s idea. In fact, it’s Tory party policy. Just read the draft immigration and visas bill tabled by the Philpster back in May. Then despair.It’s also possible it’s only Katie and the Philpster who have read the bill. Asked on Times Radio if it was party policy to remove people who were legally entitled to be here,James Cleverlyinsisted it wasn’t. Except it’s there in black and white. Poor old Jimmy Dimly. Not the sharpest of minds. Though to be fair, he would probably claim it is the Tory party which is leaving him, rather than him leaving the Tory party.Explore more on these topicsConservativesThe politics sketchImmigration and asylumRobert JenrickJames CleverlycommentShareReuse this content"

Now the president is building a place so gilded Nero would feel at home. Why did he pick an architect whose speciality is Catholic churches?Catherine SlessorThu 23 Oct 2025 11.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 23 Oct 2025 11.01 EDTShareAs if truffling thuggishly in pursuit of the Nobel peace prize wasn’t enough, the spectacle of bulldozers ripping into the White House is yet more evidence of Donald Trump’s unstinting quest for epic self-aggrandisement. Having decreed the East Wing not fit for purpose – namely, his purposes of swank and show – he plans to replace it with a faux classical bulletproof ballroom, capable of seating up to 650 partygoers.Renderings show a vast, glacially white aircraft hangar of a structure embellished with an ornate coffered ceiling, gilded Corinthian columns and drooping gold chandeliers. Nero, who conceivedthe originaldomusaurea, would feel right at home. Costing $250m (£187.5m), a sum to be extracted from sycophantic donors, Trump’s ballroom is one of the most grandiose White House projects to be implemented in more than a century, as he strives to bend the building – and US architecture more generally – to his will.His fetishisation of classicism – a recurring comfort blanket for despots of all stripes – is bleakly predictableOn re-assuming the presidency, one of his first executive orders – under the titleMaking Federal Architecture Beautiful Again– mandated that “traditional and classical architecture” should be the preferred style for all federal public buildings, with Trump having the final veto on designs. A similarly prescriptive order was enacted during Trump’s first spell in office, only to be rescinded by Joe Biden.So, having been here before, the American Institute of Architects is wearily wary, stating: “AIA is extremely concerned about any revisions that remove control from local communities, mandate official federal design preferences, or otherwise hinder design freedom, and add bureaucratic hurdles for federal buildings.”View image in fullscreenDoomed … a part of the East Wing is demolished to make way for the new ballroom.Photograph: Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty ImagesWhite House occupants do have a history of tweaking, expanding and remodelling. Theodore Roosevelt added the West Wing, Richard Nixon installed a bowling lane and Harry S Truman commissioned an entire reconstruction. Several first ladies have revamped the decor and furnishings, notably Jackie Kennedy, whosesoignéinteriors were designed to connect the presidential home more resonantly with American history.The now doomed East Wing, dating from 1902, has been a much-changed addition. Intermittently housing the office of the first lady, what’s left of it sits above the presidential emergency operations centre, a high security bunker built during the second world war. Vice-presidentDick Cheney and his retinue retreated thereduring the 9/11 attacks,as did Trumpat the start of the George Floyd protests in 2020.The man who landed the ballroom job is James McCrery, founder of Washington-based McCrery Architects and a trenchant advocate of classical architecture. “Americans love classical architecture,” he has said, “because it is our formative architecture – and we love our nation’s formation.” Ironically, McCrery began his career working for Peter Eisenman, the high priest of deconstructivism, before a conversion of Damascene proportions prompted him to renounce the avant garde and “rethink his modernist education”.View image in fullscreenNo fan of the White House … Trump holds a table seating chart of the ballroom in the renovated Oval Office.Photograph: Alex Brandon/APSpecialising in the design of “traditional” Catholic churches, McCrery was appointed by Trump during his first term to serve on the US Commission of Fine Arts, an independent federal agency with the power to review the “design and aesthetics” of all construction within Washington DC.Trump’s style edicts and building bombast exude a dictator-for-life megalomania vibe, as he barrels through his second term, with an unconstitutional third potentially in his sights. However, he is said to dislike the White House, finding it on the poky side, preferring to decamp to his Floridian resort Mar-a-Lago at every opportunity. The tone for his latest stay in the White House was set by his patio-fication of the Rose Garden, but he is now clearly aiming for a legacy more substantial than a bit of paving.His record as a “patron” of architecture has been shaped by his rollercoaster career as a property developer. To him, buildings are simply extruded capital. He has an enduring fondness for Louis XIV bling, epitomised by his enrobing of a 1960s Manhattan skyscraper in golden bronze cladding to transform it into the gleamingly phallic Trump International Hotel and Tower. His more recentengoldening of the Oval Office, described by White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt as a “golden office for the golden age”, has been unflatteringly compared toa professional wrestler’s dressing room.View image in fullscreenAn imperial wheeze … model of the new White House ballroom.Photograph: Kevin Lamarque/ReutersNonetheless, Trump’s experience as a developer was formative, in that it taught him he could get away with just about anything. It crystallised a poisonous bravado, now hardwired into the national political sphere. His fetishisation of classicism, a historically recurring comfort blanket for despots of all stripes, is bleakly predictable.“It gives Trump a narrative of authority and tradition,” says Daniel Abramson, professor of architectural history at Boston University, “and fits into his overarching strategy of undermining the established elites, including in architecture.”Another imperial wheeze, announced at a reception for prospective ballroom donors, is a huge triumphal arch, to be erected just across the Potomac river from the Lincoln Memorial. Modelled on the Parisian original and topped with a gilded, winged goddess of victory, the “Arc de Trump” is intended to commemorate the US’s 250th anniversary next year. In launching this newest vanity project, Trump said: “We love to fix up Washington.” Again, Nero would doubtless approve.Explore more on these topicsArchitectureDonald TrumpfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But teachers from other subjects say that any mentions of page 67, the year 1967 or any other phrases involving sixes or sevens, will set off a disruptive chorus. Even PE teachers can’t escape it.Thosesurveyed by the Teacher Tapp polling appalso reported students wanting six-seven painted on their faces for half-term school discos.“Six-seven is everywhere but especially in the maths classrooms, and classroom teachers are getting it the most,” a spokesperson for Teacher Tapp said. “But what does it mean? No one knows. Not even the young teachers.”A maths teacher at one London school who has issued detentions for its repeated use in class, said: “It’s the most brain dead meme in the history of brain dead memes, it’s meaningless and it is just an excuse for some children to make noise.”If anything, things seem to be worse in the US, where theWall Street Journal reportsthat teachers will avoid breaking kids into groups of six or seven. One teacher in Texas said: “If you’re like: ‘Hey, you need to do questions six, seven,’ they just immediately start yelling: ‘Six-seven!’ It’s like throwing catnip at cats.”Some British headteachers are more relaxed. “As with every craze, we just tend to ride the wave until it dies down. In my opinion, it will be over soon and we move on to the next thing,” Caroline Lowingtold the Daily Echoin Hampshire.The phrase – pronounced “six sevvv-an” and accompanied by up-and-down weighing hand motion – exploded in popularity after a content creator’s video at a US basketball game earlier this year. Although the precise meaning is obscure and malleable, ranging from “meh” to recognition of a number, there’s no denying its popularity.But most of the teachers polled said they couldn’t explain what it meant. Among the youngest teachers, aged in their 20s, barely half were confident they knew.The Teacher Tapp survey found that six-seven had displaced last year’s gen Alpha meme champion: skibidi – short for skibidi toilet, referring to an animated series involving toilets with human heads – although it lacks the lottery factor of six, seven or 67 appearing during a lesson.After six-seven, what’s next? According to the survey, cooked or cook – slang for continue or finish – is rising up the slang ranks, so that nearly half of all secondary teachers said they had also heard it used last week.Explore more on these topicsSchoolsTeachingPupil behaviourMathematicsChildrennewsShareReuse this content"

One source said Reeves is considering adding 1p to the basic rate, which would garner more than £8bn. However, doing so is likely to add to concerns about the cost of living.And with the chancellor having promised to make sure those with the “broadest shoulders” face the highest burden, others believe she is more likely to raise the higher or additional rates. Those rates, which kick in at roughly £50,000 and £125,000 a year, bring in the much smaller sums of about £2bn and £230m, respectively.How might Rachel Reeves target lawyers, accountants and doctors in her budget?Read moreOne senior official said current discussions centred on how much room Reeves wanted to give herself against her fiscal rules.The chancellor has said she wants to have more than the £10bn she accounted for at the spring statement, which has since been eroded by changing economic forecasts, but she has not yet decided how much.“There is a very live debate going on right now among those planning the budget about how bold we want to be on the headroom,” the person said.“No one wants it to be £10bn again but there is an argument we go much higher, which will mean we don’t have to come back and do this again and might have space to cut taxes before the budget.“If we go down that route however, it makes it more likely that we have to raise income tax – that is the discussion that is going on at the moment.”Another said: “Rachel is understandably nervous but there is a big desire for additional headroom. But we need a stronger argument about our purpose if we are going to make the case.”A third source said: “The politics is bad either way. What matters, I think, is doing the right thing.”The Treasury declined to comment. While Reeves and Keir Starmer both insist their manifesto commitments “stand”, they have not gone as far as guaranteeing not to break them in the budget.Reeves is facing one of the most difficult budgets any chancellor has contemplated in recent years, thanks mainly to a decision by the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) todowngrade its estimatesfor Britain’s economic productivity.That decision alone is expected to cost the chancellor an estimated £20bn a year, while she also has to account for reversing the winter fuel cut,abandoning cuts to welfare paymentsand anexpected moveto end the two-child benefit cap.The pressure has eased slightly in recent days thanks to falling interest rates on government debt, which have fallen to their lowest rates in more than a year, giving her potential savings of between £2bn and £3bn.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

And she ishoping to passthe government’s planning law in time for it to be accounted for by the OBR.None of these relatively minor tax and accounting changes are likely to give her enough money to be sure the savings will not be eroded by future economic fluctuations.As a result, some allies are urging her to make a one-off decision to break one of the party’s most important manifesto pledges with a rise in income tax.Those plans are now being discussed by the budget board, a group of advisers from Downing Street and the Treasury who meet regularly to discuss the chancellor’s options. The board is co-chaired by Torsten Bell, a Treasury minister, and Minouche Shafik, the prime minister’s chief economic adviser.Advisers say there are a number of options on the table.The underlying principle, they say, is to make sure those with the capacity to pay more tax should primarily do so. But raising the additional rate applicable to only the very highest earners would only raise an estimated £230m for every penny it goes up.Increasing the higher rate of income tax by 1p to 41p would raise £2.1bn a year, but this would apply to anyone earning above £50,271.One source said the chancellor was considering raising the basic rate of income tax by 1p, which would bring in a much more significant £8.2bn a year but may be viewed as politically toxic.One solutionpromoted by the Resolution Foundationthinktank, which Bell used to run, is to increase the basic rate of income tax by 2p but reduce employee national insurance by 2p. Such a move would raise £6bn and shift more of the burden on to pensioners and landlords, who do not pay national insurance.Ruth Curtice, director of Resolution Foundation, said: “Of all the major taxes, putting up income tax fits best with current UK economic woes of low growth and sticky inflation.“Whether or not income tax rates are changed, there should be tax reform to reduce the higher rates of tax on employment compared to other forms of income.”Explore more on these topicsBudgetIncome taxTaxBudget 2025LabourRachel ReevesnewsShareReuse this content"

They say Phillips has “devoted her life to hearing and amplifying the voices of women and girls who would have otherwise been unheard”.One of the group, Samantha Walker-Roberts, who was abused in Oldham from the age of 12, has chosen to waive her right to anonymity. The other four have used pseudonyms and call themselves Scarlett, Caitlin, Claire and Katie.The women say they want the inquiry to cover all types of sexual exploitation, including grooming gangs, and that “anyone who believes their evidence should be included” should have the chance to participate.They say they believe Phillips has remained impartial and they want her to “remain in position for the duration of the process for consistency”.They say: “She has offered some of us support prior to this process, helped survivors access services and help they would not have had without her. In consultation, we have asked for the scope to be larger than just grooming gangs, that was our right to input our opinions, which is the purpose of the panel.“Jess was clear that the focus would be on grooming gangs. However, survivors in the group explained that they would be excluded for not fitting the generalised stereotype of what that is and should focus on CSE,” referring to child sexual exploitation.Four other members of the panelresignedthis week, saying they felt the government was manipulating them to expand the scope of the inquiry to include other forms of abuse and exploitation. They said on Wednesday thatthey would return only if Phillips resigned from governmentand the inquiry was chaired by a leading lawyer.The two frontrunners to chair the investigation, the former police officerJim Gambleand the social workerAnnie Hudson, withdrew their candidacies. Gamble, a former head of the child exploitation and online protection command, said he was withdrawing because of a “lack of confidence” in him among some survivors. Government sources said on Thursday that the inquiry would take months to find a new chair.Walker-Roberts, now 31, was kidnapped from a police station in Oldham, Greater Manchester, in October 2006, as she tried to report a sexual assault she had suffered in a nearby graveyard. It sparked a devastating chain of events in which she was raped and abused by a number of men of various ethnic backgrounds over 24 hours.Police failings meant that just one, Shakil Chowdhury, a British citizen born in Bangladesh, was brought to justice. In a separate case, she was raped by a white teacher, Paul Waites, after he groomed her online.She said on Thursday she was worried for Phillips’ safety. “I’m really concerned it’s going to end up in a Jo Cox situation,” she said. “I respect and understand her answers, unlike other people who are thinking it’s a cover-up. She’s down to earth. She’s real. We need somebody real.”Mahmood said earlier this week that the inquiry would be “robust” and examine the ethnicity and religion of offenders. An audit by the Whitehall troubleshooter Louise Casey earlier this year found that “disproportionate numbers of men from Asian ethnic backgrounds” were among “suspects for group-based child sexual exploitation” in Greater Manchester, South Yorkshire and West Yorkshire. She said it was difficult to paint an accurate national picture because there was no ethnicity data recorded in two-thirds of cases.Walker-Roberts said the survivors worried there were “grey areas” when it came to defining grooming gangs. She she was worried her own experience of group based exploitation would not fit a narrow definition of a grooming gang.She said the gang that attacked her “was a one-off kidnap, so there was no grooming involved. That’s why I am fighting to say widen the scope, so that I can be included.”The Guardian understands the other women who signed the letter were exploited by grooming gangs similar to those investigated by Casey, but that the offenders were not exclusively Asian.Walker-Roberts and the other survivors who have chosen to back Phillips say leaks to the media about private discussions undertaken by the panel have left some feeling silenced and afraid. They said there should be consequences for those who breached confidentiality.They said the panel should be streamlined, but include “a range of voices to ensure everyone can be heard in a respectful way” in an effort to “find a solution that takes all views into account and serves everyone that has been a victim of CSE and their families”. They want a clearer structure when it comes to interviewing a potential chair, so “everyone has the chance to ask questions they feel are relevant in an environment where everyone’s voice is heard and important”.“These sessions should be held in person, to avoid any breaches of confidentiality to protect other survivors’ voices,” they said.They also said there should be “no re-entry” for those who had “forfeited” their position on the panel and called for an independent whistleblowing procedure to be set up. They urged everyone involved to display “respect and compassion”.“We have all been failed in the past, which is why some of us campaigned for this inquiry. It would be another catastrophic failing if the inquiry was to go ahead without including us, but we will not be included in an inquiry process that isn’t fit to serve any victim or survivor who believes they have evidence to submit to the inquiry.”Amid growing rows over the advisory panel of survivors, which will help to appoint the chair, it was disclosed that it had 30 members. All were selected on the basis that they had identified as a survivor of gang or group-based child sexual exploitation.Some of the those who have resigned, however, say there are some people on the panel who are not survivors of street-based gang-related child sexual exploitation, which is usually associated with grooming gangs.Louise Goddard, one of the five who resigned and called for Jess Phillips’ resignation, said: “Grooming gang survivors are never going to agree on everything but that is going to be complex enough without including people with other experiences outside grooming gangs.”A government minister said Phillips had “ridden the storm” and would survive. “I think people can see that this is an extremely difficult and complex inquiry, which anyone would find difficult to establish, even someone with Jess’s experience,” they said.Explore more on these topicsGrooming gangs inquiryJess PhillipsViolence against women and girlsKeir StarmerShabana MahmoodRape and sexual assaultnewsShareReuse this content"

The human rights group intends to argue in court that named Britons joined a foreign army at war with a state,Palestine, which the UK was not fighting.It claims that waging war with a foreign force is a breach of section 4 of the Foreign Enlistment Act 1870. The act makes it an offence for any person to accept or agree a commission or engagement in the military service of any foreign state at war with another foreign state that is at peace with the UK government.The ICJP has named one individual in the attempted prosecution but has gathered evidence against more than 10 British citizens.To enhance the prospects of a successful prosecution and prevent the case being prejudiced, the ICJP is not naming the individuals they want to be arrested.The ICJP accuses the Israel Defense Forces of conducting a war that is not confined to Hamas but is against all Palestinians and Palestine itself, a state now recognised by the UK.The group says it needs to prove the defendant is a British subject, accepted a commission or engagement in the Israeli armed forces, that Israel was at war with Palestine, that Palestine is a foreign state and finally that Palestine was at peace with the UK.Israeli domestic law does not require any person outside its territory, including Israeli citizens who are British subjects, to accept or agree to accept any commission or engagement in the military. This means that British nationals who fought for the IDF did so voluntarily.The ICJP says multiple and repeated military activities directed at civilians and civilian infrastructure in the West Bank andGazashow Israel has been at war with all Palestine.It claims Israel is illegally occupying the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and the Gaza Strip, as determined by the international court of justice in advisory opinions issued in July last year and again this week.Explore more on these topicsPalestineIsraelGazaIsrael-Gaza warMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

We will deliver justice so that those suffering financial hardship through no fault of their own are paid for their lost pension savings,” Shabana Mahmood said. “The Home Office Windrush scandal was a shameful stain on our history. I will leave no stone left unturned until everyone affected receives the justice they deserve.”The chair of the Windrush National Organisation, Bishop Desmond Jaddoo, said: “We welcome this. We have long raised issues about pensions so it’s good news the Home Office has finally addressed this.“We also know that once the Home Office makes a compensation offer, it is never reduced, so it makes sense to give the claimant the option to be paid 75% of that pending an appeal, it helps the financial burden people face.“It is progress in the right direction, but there is still a lot of work to be done. New issues are emerging every day of the week. The dynamics are constantly changing.”The Windrush compensation scheme (WCS) was launched in April 2019 to compensate members of the Windrush generation for losses they suffered when they were wrongly classified as illegal immigrants.Many were detained and deported years after legally settling in the UK from former British colonies in the Caribbean, often as children, but were never provided with documents “proving” their status.Claimants have long criticised lengthy delays, excessive bureaucracy and insufficient legal support which meant many have been denied compensation or have not received as much as they were owed.Many said they were only able to secure adequate compensation after seeking legal advice and requesting reviews.The co-founder of the Windrush Defenders legal support group, Anthony Brown, said: “Any improvement is welcome, but the main thing is people being able to put in viable claims, and that’s not happening because people don’t have the necessary legal assistance.“People are getting nil awards, and then when they do get legal assistance, they’re getting six-figure sums. So yes, it’s great to be awarded for your pensions, but if you don’t have the assistance to make the claim in the first place, you’re not going to get that award.“People have to have justice, and if you’re not aiming for justice, then tinkering around the edges is just going to frustrate people really.”The WCS was ordered last monthto pay £25,000 to Thomas Tobierre, 71, who spent £14,000 of his private pension when he could not work because he was unable to prove his immigration status.He was originally told private pension losses were excluded from claims. His wife, Caroline, died of cancer before receiving any compensation from her claim.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Pension compensation will include people forced to withdraw money from their pension to support themselves during the scandal.The changes, which will be applied retrospectively, follow recommendations by the independent Windrush commissioner, Rev Clive Foster, who was appointed in June to help represent victims.Responding to the announcement, Foster said: “These changes reflect what I’ve heard from survivors and will make a real difference, especially for those who don’t have time on their side. But delivery must be swift and sustained.”Hillsborough, Grenfell, Windrush, the Post Office scandal: the guilty escape justice. Well, not any more | David LammyRead moreHe said progress on employment losses was welcome, but that the failure to address future earnings losses remained “a serious gap”.“Survivors of the Home Office Windrush scandal deserve full and fair compensation. Trust will only be rebuilt through action, and I will continue to press for progress on all my outstanding recommendations,” he said.Fosterhas previously demanded urgent reform, and said it was deeply concerning that 66 people had died while waiting for compensation.The migration and citizenship minister, Mike Tapp, will announce the compensation scheme overhaul at the Windrush National Organisation conference in Birmingham on Friday.The government said £116m had been paid out across 3,501 claims as of August, and that more than 93% of claims had received a final decision.The government set up a £1.5m advocacy fund in April to support claimants, but campaigners are calling for legal aid. Research has shown that those who challenged their awards after taking legal advice received huge increases in the amount they were offered.Explore more on these topicsWindrush scandalCommonwealth immigrationImmigration and asylumHome OfficeShareReuse this content"

The EU separately agreed to a phased ban on the import of Russian liquefied natural gas.The measures against Rosneft and Lukoil – which together account for just under half of Russia’s crude exports, and follow UK sanctions last week on the companies – were the first sanctions imposed on Moscow sinceDonald Trumpreturned to the White House in January and are aimed at choking off the vital oil revenues that fund the Kremlin’s war machine.Will US sanctions on Russian oil companies be effective, and why is Trump imposing them now?Read moreWashington hopes the sanctions, which led to a 5% increase in global oil prices, will pressure Putin to return to the negotiating table by hitting Russia’s economic lifelines.The Russian leader on Thursday described the US sanctions as an “unfriendly act that does nothing to strengthen Russian-American relations” and “an attempt to put pressure on Russia”, which he said was futile.“No self-respecting country ever does anything under pressure,” Putin added in comments to Russian journalists.While he said the new sanctions would not have a significant impact on Russia, he acknowledged that “some losses are expected”.He also suggested that Trump should “think about who his administration is really working for” when advisers urge him to impose sanctions on Russian oil, and warned that the measures will lead to a rise in prices.He also warned Trump of a “very strong, if not overwhelming” response if Russia was attacked with the US Tomahawk cruise missiles thatUkrainehas been seeking unsuccessfully from Washington.The latest US sanctions bar foreign countries and companies from doing business with Moscow’s major oil producers and cut them off from much of the international financial system.There were early signs on Thursday that Russia’s two biggest energy customers were suspending their energy imports in response to the new US sanctions.India’s largest buyer of Russian oil, the privately owned Reliance Industries, hinted that it was preparing to scale back or even temporarily halt purchases. “Recalibration of Russian oil imports is ongoing and Reliance will be fully aligned with the [government of India] guidelines,” a spokesperson told Reuters.Several sources also told Reuters that China’s state-owned oil companies have suspended purchases of seaborne Russian crude, at least in the short-term, amid concerns about falling foul of the new sanctions.The oil and gas sector accounts for roughly a fifth of Russia’s GDP, and a sudden fall in demand from Russia’s two main buyers would be a devastating hit to the Kremlin’s oil revenues while pushing global prices higher.China, Russia’s closest ally, and India, which has sought to remain neutral in the war in Ukraine, have until now dismissed western pressure to curb their purchases of Russian energy as empty threats.Compliance with the sanctions would mean giving up access to the cut-price Russian crude that has helped shield their economies from rising global energy costs.Trump made the surprise announcement amid growing frustration in Washington over the war in Ukraine, culminating in his abrupt decision to cancel a summit in Budapest.Asked about the summit, Putin said the meeting would “likely be postponed”, adding that it would be a mistake to hold it without proper preparation.Putin added that he remained open to talks with Trump, saying that “dialogue is always better than war”.But other Russian officials struck a far sharper tone. Dmitry Medvedev, Russia’s former president and a senior security official known for his increasingly belligerent rhetoric, described the measures as an “act of war”.“The US is our enemy,” he wrote on social media. “Its talkative ‘peacemaker’ has now fully embarked on a path of war against Russia.”Some experts linked to the Kremlin also acknowledged that the US measures could hurt the Russian economy.Igor Yushkov, an energy specialist at the Financial University under the Russian government, told the business daily Kommersant that the sanctions on Rosneft and Lukoil would make Asian customers reluctant to buy oil directly, forcing the companies to rely on longer chains of intermediaries to charter tankers and sell their crude – a shift that would drive up costs.The impact of the sanctions will largely depend on how strictly they are enforced – particularly on whether Washington is prepared to impose secondary sanctions on countries that continue to do business with Russia’s oil companies.Russia has a month to prepare before the restrictions take full effect and will probably use that time to adapt to the new situation.Moscow has long found ways to evade western sanction through opaque trading schemes as well as its “shadow fleet” network.The network, which relies on ageing vessels sailing under obscure flags and managed through shell companies in the Middle East and Asia, has enabled Russia to sustain oil exports to key customers in India and China despite the G7 price cap and EU embargo.Some in Moscow insisted that Russia would adapt again. “New sales schemes will simply appear,” said Mikhail Zvinchuk, a popular Russian military blogger with links to the defence ministry.“They’ll make logistics and costs more complicated, but the oil business has been dealing with these issues for three years now and managing just fine,” he added.The reach of US sanctions is, however, vast, and for most companies the risk of being cut off from the broader western financial system could outweigh the benefits of continuing to trade with Russia.Explore more on these topicsRussiaOilUkraineOil and gas companiesDonald TrumpTrump administrationIndianewsShareReuse this content"

The treatment is delivered alongside androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), a hormone therapy that lowers testosterone levels.Data show the treatment combination is better than using ADT alone and is as effective as other combination treatments, according to Nice.Helen Knight, the director of medicines evaluation at Nice, said: “I’m pleased we can recommend this new combination treatment, which provides another much-needed option for people with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer.“We are determined to ensure that effective treatments such as darolutamide, which can help extend the length and quality of people’s lives, are made available fast to the people who need them.”For those with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer – where the disease has spread to other parts of the body – treatment options typically involve ADT, either on its own or combined with other drugs.Trials show adding darolutamide to standard ADTcuts the risk of death by 46%compared with ADT alone, with evidence suggesting it is as effective as other combination treatments already recommended by Nice and available on the NHS.The charity ProstateCancerUK said the new drug offered men a “gentler” treatment option with fewer side-effects compared with ADT in combination with other therapies. This could benefit older men or those who cannot be prescribed current treatments.Amy Rylance, an assistant director of health improvement at Prostate Cancer UK, said: “Darolutamide is an important new treatment that gives thousands of men with incurable prostate cancer another effective option that could halve their risk of death.“While it’s just as effective as existing drugs, it has fewer side-effects. Our hope is that this will make it easier for more men to benefit from these treatments – because right now, too many men are missing out on the treatments that can extend their lives.“It’s great that new drugs like this are being approved but this is only the first step – that’s why the government must ensure the new national cancer plan includes steps to make sure the right treatments reach the men who need them.”Rylance said she had concerns that some men now eligible for the drug may still be unable to access it because of a “postcode lottery of care” in England.She highlighted data from the recent national prostate cancer audit, which showed that less than half (47%) of men with advanced prostate cancer got the latest recommended treatments.Peter Johnson, the clinical director for cancer at NHS England, said: “This decision provides another welcome treatment option for patients living with an advanced and aggressive form of prostate cancer.“With several proven therapies already available on the NHS, this approval gives clinicians and their patients more flexibility to choose the approach best suited to individual circumstances and clinical needs.”Explore more on these topicsProstate cancerCancerNHSNational Institute for Health and Care ExcellenceHealthEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

It will be decided by a mixed panel of adult and child judges, a first for a Booker award. The inaugural chair of judges will be Frank Cottrell-Boyce, the children’s author and current children’s laureate. He will be joined by two other adult judges, who will help select a shortlist of eight books before three child judges are recruited to help decide the winner.The Booker prize foundation will also gift 30,000 copies of shortlisted and winning books to children each year, working with partners including the National Literacy Trust, The Reading Agency, Bookbanks and the Children’s Book Project. The initiative comes amid reports that children’s reading for pleasure is at itslowest level in 20 years.View image in fullscreenThe Children’s Booker prize logo.Photograph: Booker prize foundationCottrell-Boyce said the award will make it easier for children to discover books they enjoy. “Every child deserves the chance to experience the happiness that diving into a great book can bring,” he said. “By inviting them to the judging table and by gifting copies of the nominated books, it will bring thousands more children into the wonderful world of reading.“It’s going to be – as they say – absolute scenes in there,” he added. “Let the yelling commence.”The prize will celebrate contemporary children’s fiction written in or translated into English and published in the UK or Ireland. As with the adult Booker and International Booker prizes, shortlisted authors will each receive £2,500, and the winner will receive £50,000.The inaugural Children’s Booker prize will open for submissions in spring 2026, with the shortlist and child judges announced in November that year. The winner will be revealed at a dedicated event for young readers in February 2027. The eligibility period for the 2027 prize will cover books published between 1 November 2025 and 31 October 2026.The announcement has been met with widespread support from leading children’s authors. Former children’s laureates Malorie Blackman, Jacqueline Wilson, Michael Morpurgo, Cressida Cowell, Anne Fine and Joseph Coelho all welcomed the prize.Blackman called the award “a timely and very welcome addition”, while Wilson said it would “give a huge boost” to children’s books and offer a “level playing ground” for new and established writers alike.Morpurgo called the new prize “great news for children and books”, and Coelho said he fully welcomed “a robust prize that celebrates children’s literature in a manner equal to that which adult literature receives.”The prize will run in partnership with the AKO Foundation, a grant-making charity focused on improving education, supporting the arts and tackling the climate emergency.Gaby Wood, chief executive of the Booker prize foundation, described the Children’s Booker prize as “the most ambitious endeavour we’ve embarked on in 20 years,” since the launch of the International Booker in 2005.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

Will he meet Xi Jinping, and what tariff deals might be secured?Justin McCurryin TokyoThu 23 Oct 2025 19.58 EDTLast modified on Thu 23 Oct 2025 20.34 EDTShareDonald Trump is about to embark on a tour of Asia that many hope will ease trade tensions with countries in the region and repair damaged ties with China. Trump will begin his trip on Sunday at a meeting of south-east Asian nations in Malaysia, before flying to Japan to meet its new prime minister, Sanae Takaichi, early next week.But the most important stop on his itinerary will come at the end of the month, when he is expected to discuss trade, and possibly Taiwan, with Chinese leader Xi Jinping at the Apec summit inSouth Korea.Will he meet Xi Jinping?Trump isexpected to meet Xi Jinpingon Thursday next week, according to White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt. However, what they might talk about is generating more speculation than any other issue on the agenda at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) summit in Gyeongju, South Korea, and Leavitt did not provide further details on Thursday night. There is a lot at stake, so pressure is building on both men to calm trade tensions that risk damaging the world’s two biggest economies.Trump recently offered to lowertariffson Chinese exports to the US but insisted that Beijing, too, had to make concessions, including resuming purchases of US soya beans, curbing the flow of ingredients used to make the opioidfentanyl– which has caused an overdose epidemic in America – and lifting restrictions on the export to the US ofrare earth minerals, which are needed to manufacture hi-tech products such as smartphones.A failure to lower trade tensions could further damage US industries that are already dealing with the fallout from Trump’s tariffs. The US president was upbeat ahead of his meeting with Xi, telling reporters this week: “I think we’re going to end up having a fantastic deal with China … it’s going to be fantastic for the entire world”. Time is of the essence, however: Trump and Xi’s meeting, which has yet to be confirmed by Beijing, will take place just as additional duties of 100% on Chinese exports to the US are due to go into effect.The leaders are also expected to discussTaiwan, amid concern that Trump could waver on Washington’s support for the democratic, self-governing island under pressure from Xi. Beijing has reportedly asked the White House to state that it opposes Taiwan independence – a move that would delight China, which regards Taiwan as a renegade province that must be reunited with the mainland.Will there be tariff deals for south-east Asia?Trump’s attendance at the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) summit in Kuala Lumpur comes at a critical time for the regional bloc, whose 10 members together exported goods worth $312bn to the US last year, compared with $142bn in 2017. The US is the region’s biggest export destination and is reliant on Asean economies to keep its manufacturing supply chain moving.Trump’s response to the widening trade deficit with South-east Asian countries was toimpose “reciprocal” tariffsof between 10% and 40%, prompting Asean leaders to issue a joint statement voicing concern over “America first” protectionism, saying Trump’s measures “pose significant risks to the multilateral trading system and the stability of global supply chains”.Trump, who hasn’t attended an Asean summit since 2017, will meet the bloc’s leaders on Sunday, when discussions are expected to focus on Vietnam and Thailand, the two biggest contributors to the US trade deficit.An end to another ‘war’?Trump’s stop-off in Malaysia could be motivated less by trade and more by a desire to position himself at the centre of any deal to end thedisputeover un-demarcated points along Thailand and Cambodia’s 817km (508-mile) land border.Malaysiabrokered a fragile ceasefireafter five days of clashes in July that left dozens of people dead and about 300,000 displaced, but the cause of the friction remains unresolved. Malaysia’s foreign minister, Mohamad Hasan, recently told reporters that Trump was “eager” to see a peace accord signed during the summit – a breakthrough the US president would doubtless use to bolster his credentials as an international peacemaker.Will he meet Kim Jong-un (again)?You can never say never with Donald Trump. At this stage a meeting looks unlikely, although with the prospect of an end to the Ukraine war quickly receding, Trump could be persuaded to turn his attention towards his “friend” Kim and the intractable problem of North Korea’s nuclear programme.CNN, citing anonymous sources, reported last weekend that US officials had discussed setting up a meeting during his visit to Asia, and Trump said in August that he would like to meet his North Korean counterpart “in the appropriate future”.But his three previous attempts to persuade Kim to rein in his nuclear ambitions – at two summits in 2018 and 2019, and during a quickly arranged visit to thedemilitarised zoneseparating North and South Korea later that year – ended in failure. Since then, Kim has overseen steady improvements in the North’s ballistic missile programme, sent more than 10,000 soldiers tofight alongside Russian troopsin the Ukraine war, andjoined a loose anti-western alliancewith Beijing and Moscow.Days before Trump was due to arrive in South Korea for the Apec summit, the North launched two short-range missiles in what the regime described as a successful test of a new “hypersonic system” aimed at strengthening its nuclear deterrent. Against that backdrop, now does not feel like the right time for Trump to take another gamble on Kim.Has last month’s ICE raid in Georgia cooled ties with South Korea?Last month’simmigration raidby US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents at a South Korean-owned electric battery plant under construction in Georgia sparked widespread anger in Seoul. About 300 South Korean nationals were detained, amid allegations that they were working at the factory illegally. The South Korean public is unlikely to forget the incident any time soon, but the country’s president, Lee Jae Myung, has more pressing issues to take up with Trump in Gyeongju, where they are expected to meet on Wednesday.They includeconcluding a summer agreementto invest $350bn in the US economy that has been held up by disagreements over what form the South Korean investment should take. As part of the deal, the US agreed to lower tariffs on South Korean autos from 25% to 15%, the same level imposed on cars from Japan and the EU.Some observers have speculated that Lee, whomet Trump in the White Housein August, could leverage lingering fallout from the ICE debacle to win concessions from Trump. South Korean officials say they have made progress on trade in recent weeks, but conceded that “one or two” issues remain unresolved.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpTrump administrationUS foreign policyChinaNorth KoreaSouth KoreaMalaysiaexplainersShareReuse this content"

But, more than 53 years later, it is not surprising that Soldier F, the only man put on trial for murder,was found not guilty.Though four of the Paras who entered Glenfada Park North had “lost all sense of military discipline”, according to Mr Justice Lynch, direct evidence against Soldier F fell well short of “the high standard of proof required in a criminal case”.The case against Soldier F, who offered no evidence of his own, was based on statements made in the early 1970s by two Paras who were on the scene, Soldier G and Soldier H. Other evidence from civilians present, though contextually important, did not directly implicate Soldier F, the judge said.The other two soldiers described firing aimed shots themselves – in evidence that for legal reasons was inadmissible against them – but their evidence against Soldier F could not be considered reliable, Lynch concluded. He said they were “accomplices with a motivation to name F as a participant in their murderous activities”.Because it was so high profile, the trial of Soldier F was one of a handful that was allowed to continue when the previous Conservative government passed the 2023Northern IrelandLegacy Act, which halted almost all legal proceedings involving Troubles-related killings. The acquittal is an argument for why that legislation was so flawed.The core argument in its favour was to end what the Conservatives described as “vexatious prosecutions” againstBritish armyveterans decades after the event. But the reality is that there has been little evidence of a witch-hunt, with only one former soldier having been convicted since 1998. He received a suspended sentence.Though with the passage of time the hope of justice for victims’ families may have been slim, removing it completely has proved impossible to accept by victims’ groups, all political parties in Northern Ireland and the Irish government.The legislation was also indiscriminate. Among the cases it halted were investigations into the deaths of 202 soldiers and 23 veterans, such as themurder of Pte Tony Harrison, a paratrooper shot dead in 1991. Off duty, he was watching a film on television with his girlfriend in east Belfast when IRA gunmen stormed in.The problem is that it has taken too long to reach the point of a trial, a problem caused first by years of cover-ups, whether by paramilitary groups or the British state. A more recent difficulty has been the lack of funding for bodies such as the Police Ombudsman of Northern Ireland or the Historical Investigations Unit, acknowledging the legitimacy of cases like Harrison’s but unable to progress them.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But it should also act as a caution to prosecutors. “Whatever suspicions the court may have about the role of F, this court is constrained and limited by the evidence properly presented before it,” Lynch concluded.Explore more on these topicsBloody SundayNorthern IrelandBritish armyMilitarynewsShareReuse this content"

He declared war onCatholicism, ordering monasteries to be destroyed, land and valuables seized, libraries and manuscripts burned, and priests, monks and abbots executed.For hundreds of years, Catholics in England and Scotland were banned from openly worshipping. Even until the 1950s, mixed marriages between Catholics and Anglicans were frowned upon.Now, almost 500 years after Henry’s momentous breakaway, his successor,King Charles III, has prayed with Pope Leo XIV beneath the sublime frescoes of the Sistine Chapel in an act of rapprochement between the Roman Catholic church and the Church of England.“The age of mutual suspicion really is now over,” Jamie Hawkey, a canon-theologian at Westminster Abbey, told abriefing hosted by the Religion Media Centre.“Seventy years ago, it was not possible for Catholics and Anglicans to go into one another’s churches without causing great offence. This is a moment where history can be seen to be healed.”Turmoil, violence and antagonism characterised relations between Catholics and Anglicans for centuries. Queen Elizabeth I was declared a heretic and excommunicated by Pope Pius V in 1570.In 1605, a plot by Catholic conspirators including Guy Fawkes to blow up the Houses of Parliament with the Protestant King James I inside was thwarted.The 1701 Act of Settlement confirmed a ban on a Catholic or anyone married to a Catholic succeeding to the throne.But since the middle of the last century, relations between the C of E and the Roman Catholic church have thawed, with regular visits to Rome by senior royals and archbishops of Canterbury.In 2013, the Succession to the Crown Act relaxed restrictions on royal heirs marrying Roman Catholics, although the monarch must still be an Anglican.Earlier this year, King Charles and Queen Camilla made a private visit to Pope Francis days before his death. And in September, the king became the first monarch in 500 years to publicly attend a Catholic mass when he attended the funeral of the Duchess of Kent, a convert to Catholicism.The past 60 years had seen an “extraordinary rediscovery of our common roots”, said Hawkey, while acknowledging that significant disagreements remained.Catherine Pepinster, the author of The Keys and the Kingdom: The British and the Papacy, told the RMC briefing: “This country has a long history of difficulties with Rome, of tensions ever since the Reformation …“We’ve come a very long way … but until now we haven’t seen the supreme head of the Church of England – that is, the monarch – kneeling in prayer with the leader of the world’s 1.3 billion Catholics.”Explore more on these topicsCatholicismChristianityReligionAnglicanismPope Leo XIVThe papacyKing Charles IIInewsShareReuse this content"

It’s an achingly real watch that’s bitterly funny at timesLucy ManganThu 23 Oct 2025 16.45 EDTLast modified on Thu 23 Oct 2025 16.46 EDTShareIt seems at first to be your standard six-part mystery-thriller. The Ridge opens with the protagonist, Mia (Lauren Lyle, last seen in The Bombing of Pan Am 103 and as the eponymousKaren Pirie, and so good in everything) having nightmares about her traumatic childhood. She wakes to a morning routine of yoga and deep breathing – though that doesn’t seem to help as much as the opioid patch she whacks on her thigh – before heading to the local hospital, where she works as an anaesthetist and where a patient comes round during an operation, then dies on the table.But that is only the first layer of what becomes a veritable millefeuille of a drama. For Mia then heads off to Te Koi Ridge in New Zealand to attend the wedding of her semi-estranged, ecowarrior younger sister, Cassy (Connor Amor-Bendall). As the plane takes off, Mia receives a call from Cassy begging for help. By the time the plane touches down, Cassy is missing and the townsfolk, including her fiance, Ewan Carmichael (Jay Ryan), and his best friend, Teddy (Kauri Williams), are out looking for her. Teddy finds her body at the bottom of a cliff. Did the experienced climber fall, as everyone seems willing to assume, or was she – as Mia is far more ready to believe – pushed?From there, the tale expands to include multiple complications. There are seething tensions between the local people and the eco-activists who, having been led by Cassy despite Ewan’s objections, are becoming more and more extreme in their efforts to stop farmers harming the land. Tractors are burning, livelihoods are threatened. There is the tangled web of interrelationships – familial, friendly and otherwise – that besets any small town. The local sergeant, for example, is Ewan’s half-sister – an offshoot of the Carmichael family, which dominates the town – and her husband is its undertaker. The opportunities and motives for murder and cover-ups begin to proliferate nicely.Then there is Ewan’s mother, who has dementia, her condition used as a plot-device to let slip clues to secrets she can no longer keep, sending Mia haring off down another avenue of discovery. There is also the group of disaffected youngsters, including Ewan’s niece, who get wind of Mia’s addiction and are keen to trade information for the dwindling opioid supply she stole from the hospital drug cupboard before she left, plus the video Mia finds on Cassy’s phone of her sister secretly skinny-dipping with someone who is not Ewan. Finally, there is the death 15 years ago of Ewan’s then-high school girlfriend, Hera, in an apparent suicide, and someone leaves a cutting about the case on the windscreen of Mia’s car. Will this or Ewan’s eventual admission that he and Cassy rowed before he left her to her climbing expedition be enough to curtail the growing attraction between Mia and her late sister’s fiance? We will have to wait until episode three to find out.It is all woven together in a masterly fashion, along with the accumulating professional problems in the UK as the violent, criminal family of the patient who died demands retribution and managers begin to look more closely at Mia’s records. The inherent strangeness and wild beauty of the New Zealand setting add a dash of menace to every scene, a sense that anything might be possible if you take your eye off someone or something for a moment too long. The festering resentments of a small town, the secrets everyone knows and those just a few guard closely feel real and unnaturally potent. But the real glory is Mia: a difficult, dislikable, manipulative individual, she is admirably fearless and ferocious, good and bad by turns, with all of it stemming from the damage done to her, and to Cassy, by a monstrous mother over the course of a monstrous childhood. It is a magnificent performance by Lyle, who is beginning to specialise in iconoclastic characters who throw viewers off balance and demand a rolling recalibration of entire dramas each time they appear in their scenes.It is also bitterly funny, often in ways that make it achingly real and add to the melancholy at its heart. When Cassy’s body arrives at the house in an open casket for the wake, for example, her makeup is horribly overdone. “She looks like the portrait from Elton John’s attic!” Or when Mia is explaining that obesity can undermine the efficacy of anaesthesia on a patient. What killed hers was: “Three stab wounds and too many pies.”If you’ll pardon the pun, get stuck in. The Ridge is good, good stuff.The Ridge airs on BBC Scotland and BBC Two and is on iPlayer now.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewreviewsShareReuse this content"

The bone-deep selfishness of this character, a Pulitzer-winning author who repeatedly and committedly dismisses his wife for the fleeting fancy of an emotional affair, overwhelms Anna Ziegler’s drama, which played off-Broadway in 2023.Concerned with inheritance and the way we fictionalise our lives, The Wanderers circles two unhappy couples in Brooklyn. The angsty, escapist Abe (Alexander Forsyth) and his frustrated wife, Sophie (Paksie Vernon), are secular. Abe’s father Schmuli (Eddie Toll) revels in the rituals and rules of Hassidic Jewish life, while Abe’s mother, Esther (Katerina Tannenbaum, radiant), is desperate to break free.View image in fullscreenBone-deep selfishness … Alexander Forsyth as Abe, right, with Anna Popplewell as Julia in The Wanderers.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianWearing headphones, Abe watches on as his parents’ past lives play out, as if tuning into the right frequency to overhear the fumbling start to their marriage transform into fights over Esther’s freedom.Esther is the beating heart of the play, with Tannenbaum holding loss and longing in every breath. But too much time is spent listening to Abe flirt with Hollywood star Julia (Anna Popplewell, who has the tough job of playing a flat fantasy).Igor Golyak’s direction struggles to ease us into the overlapping timelines and geographies. Confiding their feelings over email, Abe and Julia spend an inordinate amount of time sitting next to each other and pretending to click-clack on invisible laptops, which rather drains away the romance.Jan Pappelbaum’s snow-covered set has the characters drawing the world for each other, white pens conjuring roads, radios and chapter headings on large sheets of Perspex. But this conceit too often gets in the way, distracting from the story rather than serving it.Ziegler’s script is preoccupied with the aches and traditions we hold on to from the generations above, which can at once shape, comfort and harm us. Her characters all seek a partner who sees them for who they truly are. On this stage, it is hard not to see a father and a son who could have been happy, if only they had extended goodness towards anyone but themselves.AtMarylebone theatre, London, until 29 NovemberExplore more on these topicsTheatrereviewsShareReuse this content"

Such seasonal delights arealready troubling Britain. And then there are themental health challenges associated with this time of year. How can you avoid spending the next few months feeling unwell? Here, GPs give their advice on the best ways to stay healthy in the winter.Take care of the fundamentals“Winter is a tricky time,” says Dr Babak Ashrafi, a GP who works for Superdrug and is based in London. “Short days, chilly air and a lot of time spent indoors with other people and their germs. My advice is to think of health as a three-legged stool: sleep, nutrition and movement. If one leg gets wobbly, the whole thing will tip over.”“People often wonder if there is something they can take, or something different they can do, to stay healthy over winter,” adds Dr Helen Salisbury, a GP in Oxford. “Really it is a question of doing the same things that you might do the rest of the year: exercise, sleep, eat healthily, and try not to consume too much alcohol.”Have jabs if they are offeredThe advice is to take up vaccinations if they are offered to you. “On the NHS, the flu jab is free for over-65s, people with long-term health conditions (such as asthma or diabetes), pregnant women, and children in certain age groups,” says Ashrafi. “The Covid booster eligibility changes each year depending ongovernment guidance, but the principle is the same: protecting the most vulnerable.” He adds: “If you’re not eligible, I’d say it is well worth paying for a private flu jab.”Practise basic hygiene in peak germ seasonView image in fullscreenWashing your hands and wearing masks helps stop germs spreading.Photograph: posed by models; MoMo Productions/Getty ImagesAlways remember the basics, especially when there are more germs in circulation, says Dr Fari Ahmad, a GP at Wilmslow health centre in Cheshire: “Wash your hands if you have been in contact with somebody or when you are eating food. Masks are still around and sometimes they can help stop you spreading germs and people spreading to you.”Choose supplements carefullyThe GPs agree it is beneficial to take a vitamin D supplement. “Between October and April, the UK sun simply isn’t strong enough for our skin to make it, and it is crucial for immune function and bone health,” says Ashrafi. “Everyone should consider supplementing 10 micrograms daily. Multivitamins aren’t harmful, but they are not a substitute for healthy eating. The ones I’d say you can skip are ‘immunity boosters’ with fancy packaging but little scientific backing. If your diet’s balanced and you’re topping up vitamin D, you’re doing well.”There islimited evidence that taking vitamin C supplements is useful, explains Salisbury: “Lots of work has been done to try to find out whether vitamin C makes a difference to how likely you are to catch colds or how quickly you can fight them off. There is some evidence that taking it makes the symptoms slightly less severe and marginally shorter in duration, but unless you are deficient taking a supplement probably doesn’t make a noticeable difference.”Eat with immunity in mindView image in fullscreenChoose foods that can help support your immune system.Photograph: Alexander Spatari/Getty Images“Think of food as fuel and defence,” says Ashrafi. “You want foods that keep you energised and support your immune system. Protein from eggs, fish, lean meat, pulses and nuts is essential for repair. Bright fruit and veg are packed with antioxidants and vitamins that fight off infection. Complex carbs such as oats, brown rice and sweet potatoes release energy slowly, avoiding blood sugar dips that leave you sluggish. And don’t forget healthy fats like olive oil, avocado and oily fish – they are brilliant for heart and brain health.”Learn the best ways to manage cold and flu symptomsThere isn’t really a lot you can do to treat winter bugs: “Most are caused by viruses, and we don’t have any specific medicines to make them go away – we can treat the symptoms but not the cause,” says Salisbury. Ashrafi suggests the best way to ride them out is through hydration, rest and managing symptoms. For a cold, he recommends “paracetamol or ibuprofen to bring down fever and ease aches, honey and lemon to soothe a sore throat, and saline sprays or steam inhalation to help unblock sinuses”.Flucan be more extreme, he adds. “If you have muscle aches, fever and exhaustion, assume it is flu and give yourself proper recovery time. Most people feel better in a week, but don’t rush back to work if you’re still unwell. You’ll just prolong it.”“A really bad sore throat is one of the features of the current variant of Covid, so consider testing for that,” says Salisbury.See a doctor if symptoms persist or you feel breathless“Most colds and flu will get better on their own,” says Salisbury. “If you’re getting very breathless, then your GP needs to know about that.”“If your cough lasts more than three weeks, or if you’re coughing up blood, struggling to breathe, or feeling generally unwell with chest pain or a high fever, see a doctor,” advises Ashrafi.Feeling feverish in the first two or three days of a cold can be expected, but that should settle down, says Salisbury: “If you then get another big rise in temperature, and you keep having a temperature, usually with breathing difficulties as well, that will be a sign you’ve got pneumonia, not just flu.”The blood pressure secret: everything you need to know to improve yours – and live a longer, healthier lifeRead moreHave a well-stocked medical cupboardWhen you are poorly, it is miserable having to trek out to get supplies. “Make sure your medicine cupboard is stocked with paracetamol and ibuprofen, if you can take it,” says Ahmad.“There are nasal sprays, some of which provide a gel covering inside your nose, and others which kind of wash it out,” says Salisbury. “There issome evidencethat if you use those in winter, particularly when you have been in the company of someone who has clearly got a virus, that can reduce your chances of getting that virus yourself. ”Some medicines may not be worth buying, Salisbury says: “Cough medicinesdon’t really work. However, painkillers such as ibuprofen and paracetamol are good for a sore throat, and gargling with soluble versions of these can be helpful.” You can also buy local anaesthetic sprays or lozenges in the pharmacy, which would help, too. Salisbury is cautious about using cold and flu remedies: “They often have quite a small dose of paracetamol in, so it is less than you would have for a full dose, but then you can’t take your full dose of paracetamol on top of it. You have to be careful about combining them with other medicines.”Look after your mental health, tooMany can relate to the symptoms of seasonal affective disorder (Sad) but the condition is not clear-cut, says Salisbury: “Is it the light, or is it the fact that you’re getting less exercise because you’re stuck at home as it is dark outside? Is it because there is less going on and less fun out there? We really don’t know whether it is the season itself, and the actual light levels, or everything that is associated with winter, like being that bit colder and having possibly less opportunity to socialise. Sad definitely exists but it is a complicated mix.”However, there is no doubt that “winter can take a toll on mood”, says Ashrafi. “The trick is to build structure and joy into your days. Get outside every day, even for 10 minutes of daylight. And try to keep your sleep routine steady; oversleeping can actually make you more fatigued.”Prioritise socialisingView image in fullscreenSpending time with other people can help your mental health.Photograph: Janina Steinmetz/Getty ImagesLoneliness can be a massive factor in the winter blues, says Salisbury. “It is allabout connections with other people,” she says. “Try to join in with events in your community and look out for your neighbours. Spending more time with people or thinking about what you can do for others can really help your mental health.”“Keep socially connected,” Ashrafi agrees. “Make plans that give you something to look forward to, however small.”But don’t spread the germsCover your mouth when coughing or, even better, stay home if you are ill. “If you do have a cold or the flu, be careful not to pass it to other people,” says Salisbury. “You are more likely to get these things if you’re in crowded places with lots of people coughing, because that is how they get passed on. A well-fitting mask will reduce your chance of getting or passing on viruses, but beyond that, there isn’t a specific thing you can do to protect yourself. It is a matter of luck.”Move your bodyThere can be less inclination to exercise in the winter, says Ahmad, but it is essential that you fit it into your routine. “Do something you love: dancing, Zumba, cycling – whatever it is that you enjoy. If you struggle with the weather and going outdoors, is there something you can do indoors? Can you switch to swimming in the winter and leave jogging for the summer? Find the activity that you’re able to do without it feeling like a burden. If you’re going with friends, or you’re attending an exercise class, sometimes that is more manageable.”Don’t overdo the boozeDuring festive party season “it is quite easy to get in the habit of drinking too much alcohol,” says Salisbury. “Think about the low-alcohol or no-alcohol alternatives. The change in the past few years has been amazing with what is out there.”If you do go overboard, you risk getting run-down, says Salisbury: “Alcohol and sleep deprivation will make you more prone to infection, along with the damage caused by smoky environments. Whether you are smoking yourself or are just in a smoky atmosphere, it can make your lungs more vulnerable.”Create winter health ritualsView image in fullscreenYoga is an ideal exercise to take up for the winter months.Photograph: Posed by models; DisobeyArt/Getty ImagesWhat do the GPs do to keep healthy over winter, despite being exposed to a multitude of germs at work? “I’m conscious of the air quality in my consulting room,” says Salisbury. “Even in winter, I open the window quite often to let in some fresh air, particularly if people have been coughing in front of me.”“I do think being exposed to so many bugs, I will fall ill at some point,” says Ahmad, “but actually, because I’ve just been exposed to so many bugs, I don’t think my immune system is in too bad a shape. But I do try to make sure my vitamin D levels are where they should be, so I am taking supplements.” She also ensures that she has some downtime in the week, ideally with a friend. But there is always room for improvement: “My exercise isn’t where it should be in winter,” she says. “I’m planning to attend some yoga classes, so let’s see how that goes.”“I’m a big believer in routine with flexibility,” says Ashrafi. “I start the day with light, even if it is artificial, and a brisk walk to the gym for a workout before work. I make sure to cook something colourful in the evenings, like soups, curries and stews. I keep my vitamin D next to my toothbrush, so I don’t forget to take it. I also allow myself rest. Winter is not the time for extremes; it is about being kind to your body and listening to what it needs.” But, he admits: “I am human, I have lazy weekends and too much chocolate sometimes – that is balance.”Explore more on these topicsHealth & wellbeingThe expertsNutritionFluVaccines and immunisationHygieneMental healthfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It was impactful enough to send their single Tainted Love first into the Top Ten, then to No 1 – it ultimately became the second biggest-selling single of the year – and to provoke a number of complaints. The latter were caused by the duo’s frontman,Marc Almond, clad in eyeliner and jewellery, delivering his vocal with a weird combination of intense passion, high camp and occasional knowing looks to camera: he was clearly a gay man, but a gay man who declined to conform to the pantomime stereotype that still prevailed on British TV, a decision that first upset his own record company boss – who collared Almond backstage and protested “you’ve got to butch it up a bit!” – then apparently caused the BBC’s switchboards to light up.View image in fullscreenMarc Almond and Dave Ball of Soft Cell.Photograph: Peter AshworthAlmond was such an arresting presence that it was easy to overlook the other guy on stage, moustachioed, mute and virtually motionless behind his keyboard. But, as his bandmate was given to pointing out, overlookingDave Ballwas a terrible misjudgement. “He really was a psycho,” Almond later recalled. “There would be times when he’d leap from behind the keyboards if someone was threatening me on stage, and he’d punch someone in the front row.”Moreover, Ball was every bit as integral to Soft Cell’s success as Almond. He had grown up in Blackpool, one of northern soul’s hotspots, and was largely responsible for the music’s presence in Soft Cell’s oeuvre: they covered not just Gloria Jones’s warp-speed stomper Tainted Love, but Judy Street’s What and Franki Valli’s The Night, Northern dancefloor favourites all. It was Ball who’d come up with their version of Tainted Love’s hook, by percussively emphasising the first two notes of the song’s bassline on his synth: doink-doink! It was Ball’s childhood love of John Barry soundtracks that gave Soft Cell’s greatest single – the quite extraordinarily spiteful ballad Say Hello, Wave Goodbye – with its cinematic lushness and Ball’s Korg-bass synth that became the signature of their early sound (you can hear it used to impressively filthy effect on Tainted Love’s follow-up, the Top 5 hit Bedsitter). And if he looked less of an obvious threat to the heteronormative mores of middle England than his bandmate, Ball was equally committed to the idea that Soft Cell should be a pop band that could, in Almond’s words, “provoke people, shock them, wake them up, be subversive”. His own tastes in electronic music ran less to synth-pop than the confrontational racket made by Suicide and Throbbing Gristle.Ball and Almond’s own desire for confrontation made them stand out, even in the anything-goes climate of post-punk pop, as demonstrated by the tabloid furore caused by the video for Sex Dwarf, a track from their debut album Non-Stop Erotic Cabaret, and the fact that their debut album had a track called Sex Dwarf on it in the first place.It made for a succession of startling releases, but after their initial brace of hits, it also proved their commercial downfall: anything-goes climate or not, trailing their second album with two singles that respectively concern themselves with a horribly dysfunctional family (Where the Heart Is) and amphetamine-fuelled compulsive sexual behaviour (the John Rechy-inspired Numbers) proved a little too much for the British record-buying public. By the time of their third album, 1984’s extraordinary This Last Night in Sodom, it was hard to avoid the feeling Ball and Almond were going out of their way to destroy whatever remained of their pop success. Produced by Ball and recorded in mono “just to be bloody-minded”, it sounded claustrophobic, chaotic and viscerally thrilling: on one track, the clanking, improvised, completely atonal Slave to This, Ball really let his love of industrial music run riot. Its lead single Soul Inside was accompanied by a video of the duo smashing up their gold and platinum discs. They broke up shortly after its release.On Ball’s subsequent solo album, In Strict Tempo, he ventured deeper into the musical leftfield: equally influenced by dance, classical and industrial music, it featured vocals by Genesis P-Orridge and Gavin Friday of the Virgin Prunes, while its cover star was Geoff Rushton, better known as John Balance of Coil. But after its release, he worked mainly as a producer and remixer. He kept up his association with Genesis P-Orridge, contributing to Jack the Tab and Tekno Acid Beat, two 1988 Psychic TV projects that billed themselves as acid house albums, despite sounding substantially less like acid house than Soft Cell’s first single Memorabilia which, with its relentless four to the floor kick drum and trebly chattering synth, weirdly presaged the music sweeping Britain during the Second Summer of Love in 1988.In fact, Ball was ahead of the curve when it came to acid house in more ways than one. Introduced to the then-legal drug MDMA in New York during the making of Non-Stop Erotic Cabaret, the duo let it consume their remix album Non Stop Ecstatic Dancing. The clue was in the title, not that anyone in the UK at the time would have known what ecstasy was, or indeed what the rap on a new version of Memorabilia was driving at: “We take a pill and shut our eyes and let our love materialise / I don’t mean love on a chocolate box, I mean a love that really rocks.”In 1989, he formed the Grid with another Psychic TV alumnus, Richard Norris. In a curious echo of Soft Cell’s success with Tainted Love, they scored a huge hit with a track that wasn’t fully representative of what they were about. A commercial house tune driven by a banjo sample and recorded, at least in part, with the intention of irritating dance purists, Swamp Thing was released in 1994 – the same year the duo produced another huge house hit, Billie Ray Martin’s Your Loving Arms – but its perky, radio-friendly tone was some distance from the more esoteric aspects of the Grid’s oeuvre. They had previously collaborated with Timothy Leary and Sun Ra and Roxy Music’s Andy MacKay; the more characteristic tracks on the album from which Swamp Thing was taken, Evolver, heavily featured the treated guitar of Robert Fripp; it might be more fitting if they were remembered for 1990’s sublime Balearic classic Floatation, best heard in Norris and Andy Weatherall’s collaborative Subsonic Grid Mix.The Grid never split up – they released an entire collaborative album with Fripp in 2021 – but by the early 00s, Ball and Almond, who had intermittently worked together in the 90s, had reconvened Soft Cell. Their initial reformation, which produced 2002’s Cruelty Without Beauty album, quickly floundered after a disastrous American tour. They decided to finish things properly with a one-off 2018 farewell show at London’s O2 Arena, but ended up going on further tours and made a new album, Happiness Not Included. You could understand why their plans changed: the O2 show was rapturously received, a little chaotic and a potent reminder that Soft Cell were a pop duo like no other. Watching Almond leading the audience in a sing-along to Sex Dwarf, or Ball strafing 1983’s Meet Murder My Angel with howling noise from a modular synthesiser, it was hard not to boggle at the idea that this was a band who had ever graced the stage of Top of the Pops or the cover of Smash Hits.View image in fullscreen‘Beautiful, heartbreaking, frustrating, messy, combustible’ … Soft Cell in 2021.Photograph: Mike OwenBut they had, and you could never quite forget about it, because of the degree of influence their career exerted. They were the first, but certainly not the last British synth-pop duo to marry emotive vocals with icy electronics: Andy Bell of Erasure claimed they “never would have existed” had Soft Cell not existed first. At one extreme, Ball’s intro to Tainted Love has been sampled on hits by Rihanna, Pink and Flo-Rida. At the other, Trent Reznor was so inspired by what he called the “beautiful, heartbreaking, frustrating, messy, combustible” sound of The Art of Falling Apart and This Last Night in Sodom that he borrowed the title of the latter’s opening track for the first track of Nine Inch Nails’ The Downward Spiral: Mr Self Destruct.Being the musical link between Rihanna and Nine Inch Nails is no mean feat, but Dave Ball was not a man much given to blowing his own trumpet: “I just lurked in the background,” he once shrugged. In response, Marc Almond reiterated that overlooking his bandmate was a terrible misjudgement. “Soft Cell,” he told one interviewer firmly, “was more Dave than me”.Explore more on these topicsPop and rockMarc AlmondElectronic musicDave BallNorthern soulcommentShareReuse this content"

This happens whenBruce Springsteenfinally leaves his New Jersey heartland, and sees a shrink in shallow LA where he has bought a house. Otherwise, it’s all chunks of expositional dialogue (“I’m just trying to find something real in the noise!” “It’s like he’s channelling something deeply personal!”), black-and-white flashbacks to his tough upbringing, scenes in the recording studio with producers and execs looking on wonderstruck behind the glass while the magic happens. And there’s some very strange stuff about Bruce’s romantic life.Jeremy Allen White does an intelligent, committed job as Springsteen; Jeremy Strong gives of his considerable best with the thanklessly dull role of Bruce’s manager and friend Jon Landau, and Stephen Graham is Springsteen’s abusive but troubled dad Douglas with whom Springsteen finally comes to terms. In fact White and Graham have the film’s best scene, a scene so weird that it must surely be true. Springsteen’s old dad, waiting humbly and penitently in the Boss’s dressing room after the show, asks Bruce in a voice filled with pathos to sit on his knee and Springsteen has to point out gently that he is a grown man and has in fact never done this before in his life, not even as a kid.The meat of the film’s drama is a key moment of emotional and artistic crisis in Springsteen’s life: the recording of his radically lo-fi acoustic album Nebraska in 1982, composed and largely recorded in the bedroom of hisNew Jerseyhouse. It was an artistic indulgence which the record company nervously permitted because they had in their back pocket the thrilling track that would later make Springsteen stratospheric: Born in the USA. The album is inspired by figures as various as Flannery O’Connor and notorious Nebraska spree killer Charles Starkweather, the model for Martin Sheen in Terrence Malick’s film Badlands. It’s also about whether you should embrace or escape your home town.It’s all unexceptional enough; but the film also invents for Springsteen an imaginary girlfriend called Faye Romano, played by Odessa Young, supposedly the sister of a guy from the old neighbourhood; she has a daughter from a former relationship. Springsteen dates Faye in all her realness and integrity, but ultimately leaves her behind. So how about Faye’s daughter? She has been encouraged to think of Bruce as her stepdad, so will she one day think of Bruce in those heart-rending black-and-white flashback terms? Or are she and her mum just there to underscore Bruce’s caring blue-collar masculinity? The film is a derivative, if well intentioned, piece of fan fiction.Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere is out on 23 October in Australia, and on 24 October in the UK and US.Explore more on these topicsFilmBiopicsBruce SpringsteenJeremy Allen WhiteJeremy StrongStephen GrahamNew JerseyreviewsShareReuse this content"

As hard-right figures spread division and laud autocrats, a fail-safe is vitalThu 23 Oct 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 23 Oct 2025 08.03 EDTShareAfter two years in Brazil, I felt I understood its political system better than I understand the UK’s. The reason is a short book in simple language that almost everyone owned: the constitution, published in 1988. Admittedly, I discovered the document’s limitations while trying to explain its principles to a furious captain of the military police with a pump-action shotgun. But at least I knew exactly which of my rights he was infringing.To achieve a similar grasp of rights and powers in the UK, you’d need to be a professor of constitutional law. Theyare containedin avast and contradictorymorass of legal statutes, court precedents, codes of conduct, scholarly opinions, treaties, traditions, gentlemen’s agreements and unwritten rules. They are rendered still less intelligible by arcane parliamentary procedures and language so opaque that we need a translation app.This mess allows great scope for interpretation, whichruthless operatorsreadily exploit. Think of Boris Johnson’s use of Henry VIII powers andhis prorogationof parliament, orTony Blair’s attemptto stop parliament debating his attack on Iraq, by invokingroyal prerogative. These “gentlemen” are no gentlemen. Unwritten rules are for suckers.It’s not that the UK has no constitution. We have one, but its thread is as easy to follow as a fishing line washed ashore after months at sea, bundled and ravelled in weed and tar. In that horrific legal tangle, our citizenship is encoded. If democracy is not clear and intelligible, it’s not democracy.The issue has been pressingsince the Brexit vote.But it becomes still more urgent today, as we may now be threatened with a blatantly authoritarian government. To give one example, Richard Tice, deputy leader of Reform UK, hasexpressed admirationfor the autocratic United Arab Emirates, agreeing with the article his partner Isabel Oakeshottwrote aboutmoving to Dubai in the Telegraph. She lauded the absence of protests, the fact that there is “no safety net” and that people who “can’t look after themselves are simply imprisoned or deported”, and minimised the poor working conditions of migrant labourers (they are getting paid!). She might have added thathomosexuality is illegal, there are no significant environmental protections andmodern-day slaveryis rife. Dubai is aparadise for the richand hell for everyone else. Tice claims that the UK, by contrast,has become “decadent”: a word that should ring any historian’s alarm bells.In a country without a clearly resolved (“codified”) constitution, there is nothingto stop a governmentwith a safe majority from making the UK more like the UAE, or any other dictatorship.As the chaos after the EU referendum reminded us, at nearly all times, parliament is sovereign. The referendum was a rare act of popular sovereignty, whose result sent parliament into aflat spin. What parliamentary sovereignty means is that parliament can do whatever the hell it likes to us, as long as a majority is achieved. There are no effective limits on its actions. In a true democracy, by contrast, thepeople are sovereign, with fundamental rights that cannot be cancelled.The problem is compounded by the fact that we have no codified separation of powers. Through the use of whips and threats, any executive (prime minister, cabinet and advisers) commanding a significant majority of MPs can force parliament to do its will. In other words, parliament has seized the powers that should be vested in the people, and the prime minister has seized the powers that should be vested in parliament. This is what “elective dictatorship” means.We’ve been lucky that no government has yet explored the full scope of such powers. Johnson and Liz Truss were thwarted by their own chaotic failure to prepare, just as Donald Trump was in his first term. His supporters in US junktanks, led by the Heritage Foundation, ensured that no such mistake would be made again. ItsProject 2025probed the weaknesses of the US constitution and discovered that many of its safeguards are illusory when the president has majorities in Congress, and the supreme court seemingly in his back pocket.I would be surprised if the Westminster junktankswere not preparinga Project 2029 for Reform UK, to make full use of our much greater vulnerabilities. Well-funded organisations such as the Atlas Networkexist to reproducesuccessful strategies in one country after another.It is not hard to picture a government in this country using statutory instruments to extend its executive authority, enabling it to impose further statutory instruments, and so on, until the feeble thing we call democracy vanishes altogether. And if we want to protest against such strategies? Sorry, too late. Without constitutional safeguards, Labour and the Conservativeshave already deletedalmost all those rights. Democratic implosion could happen almost overnight.If Keir Starmer had sought to hold the door open for Nigel Farage, he couldn’t have done a better job. He has manufactured disillusionment and alienation on an industrial scale. By adoptingFarage-like positionson asylum and immigration, he legitimises Reform while delegitimising Labour. The very least he now owes us is some protection against the worst that could happen. A constitution, in other words.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But our situation is beginning to look like a political emergency. It’s also an opportunity we may not see again in our lifetimes. Thanks to the absurd results of our first-past-the-post system,Labourhas 62% of seats in the Commons. It could easily muster a two-thirds majority, necessary in most countries for constitutional change.The shift could begin with a citizens’ constitutional convention,like Iceland’sperhaps, and participatory events all over the country. Imagine: a thoughtful, deliberative process that treats us as active and intelligent citizens, rather than political consumers! That alone would be a major break from the way power now operates in this country. This would feed into a parliamentary process huge in ambition and scope, which in itself could revitalise faith in politics. It would help us to decide collectively what we want and who we are. It would leave us with a clear, transparent, intelligible set of rights and powers. Who but a tyrant and his consiglieri would oppose it?Of course, a constitution is no guarantee against autocracy, as the US is discovering. But it makes the would-be despot’s job much harder, and equips us with the tools to push back. Maintaining our tangled, opaque settlement is an elite project. Replacing it with a codified version is democracy’s work.George Monbiot is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsConstitutional reformOpinionLabourKeir StarmerReform UKRichard TiceNigel FaragecommentShareReuse this content"

That is in the discovery and defence of the new. The world is often unkind to new talent, new creations. The new needs friends.” TheBooker prizehas been a friend to the new – new voices, new names, new ways of telling a story – for 56 years. It has made household names of writers whose work might otherwise only have been enjoyed by a few. More importantly – especially since the launch of the International Booker in 2005 – it has helped broaden the horizons of readers.View image in fullscreenJamie Smart’s Bunny vs Monkey.Illustration: David Fickling BooksNow there’s going to be a Booker prize for children’s books aimed at readers aged eight to 12, and I am going to be the first chair of judges. Despite my vast vocabulary, I can’t begin to tell you how hopeful this makes me. Because if the Children’s Booker brings the same energy and boldness to the world of children’s books, it’s going to make a real difference to the lives of thousands of children. It comes at a crucial moment. Everyone knows that children who read for pleasure do better educationally and emotionally. Yet – as we approach the government’s Year of Reading – we find ourselves in a situation where the number of children who read daily hasdropped to a 20-year low. We risk losing a whole generation.Every child deserves the chance to grow up to be a reader. For that to happen, every child has to have the opportunity to find and choose the book that speaks to them. Current children’s fiction is a wild party of invention – from Jamie Smart’s Bunny vs Monkeys to Katherine Rundell’s arcane Impossible Creatures and Christopher Edge’s terrifying Escape Rooms. There is something here for everyone. But you need to be invited. By bringing coverage, controversy and above all conversation to the party, the Children’s Booker prize will throw open the doors and shout: come on in! Most of all because of this brilliant notion: children on the judging committee.Obviously for me – as chair of the judges – this is a terrifying prospect. Will I get a nickname? Will they test me on thesix-seven meme? But for children, this is a thrilling call to get involved. Above all I’m delighted that the programme is going to involve gifting books to thousands of children who would not otherwise have access to them.View image in fullscreenKatherine Rundell’s Impossible Creatures.Photograph: BloomsburyWe have no idea what kind of world we are sending our children into. We don’t know what work will look like, what communication will look like, even what relationships will look like. But we do know that they will need to know how to be happy. Reading – especially shared reading – really helps build the apparatus of happiness inside a child.If you’re reading this, I’m willing to bet that as a child you looked for Narnia in the back of every wardrobe, or squinted down each side road hoping for a glimpse of Diagon Alley. By and large it’s in books that we first hear that call from life that says wonder and pain and love and adventure are out there waiting for us. There are solid neurological reasons why books are best at this. We control the speed of input. We are exploring possibilities.I became a children’s writer after an encounter with the Swiss author and activist Mariella Mehr. She had been brought up in care, in a series of brutal and brutalising institutions. But from the youngest age she had kicked against them. I asked her why. How did she know there might be more to life – that she deserved better? I’ve never forgotten her reply: “I read Heidi.” In my travels I meet children who are imprisoned like her – not by walls but by ideas about class, race, gender. I never stop believing that there are stories out there that can dynamite those walls. If the Children’s Booker prize gets that kind of dynamite into a few more children’s hands, then I don’t care how many bad names my fellow judges call me.Our children have borne the brunt of a series of crises including austerity and the pandemic.

The cause? A loneliness epidemic that state cash can’t solveAnna GromadaBonuses for families have done nothing to fix a baby bust caused by post-communist Europe’s relationships crisisThu 23 Oct 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 23 Oct 2025 05.13 EDTShareIn 2015, I found myself advising Poland’s president on the nation’s demographic woes: thecountry’s fertility rate had stalled at 1.3 children per woman, among the lowest inEurope. I thought I understood the problem. Most Polish couples wanted to have two kids but settled for one. The culprits, I believed, were predictable: precarious jobs, not enough childcare, apartment prices out of reach. At 27, flush with the confidence that comes from being both right and young, I sparred with politicians and policymakers twice my age, usually men, who insisted that women like me would reproduce if only the state threw enough cash into the cradle.We were all, it turned out, fighting the wrong battle. In the decade since then, unemployment in Poland has sunk to one of the lowest in the EU. Incomes havemore than doubled. Nursery and childcare placesare multiplying. The government now channelsalmost 8%of the national budget into cash transfers known as the“800 Plus” programme, so called because the state pays families 800 zlotys every month, per dependant child.And yet, over the same time period, thepopulation has shrunkby 1.5 million. A million new one-person households have materialised in the demographic ledger, quiet entries in a changing social contract. In 2024, Poland’s fertility ratecollapsed to 1.1– meaning it ranks among the world’s least fertile countries, beside war-scarred Ukraine. This year, it is poised to fall further, to 1.05.The problem is not simply that Poles are having fewer children. Increasingly, they have no partners with whom to try. For the latest phase of gender wars impedes not only childbearing but the very formation of couples – here understood as heterosexual unions – on which birth statistics still mostly rest.For most of human history, being alone meant being dead. The word “loneliness” barely existed in English until the industrial age. At the dawn of the 20th century, only a tinyshareof adults remained unmarried – smaller still in eastern Europe than in the west. In the lands of today’s Poland, scarcely 8% lived as single people; in England, it was nearly double.A century later, the balance has flipped. Nearly half of Poles under 30 are single. Another fifth are in relationships but live apart. This generation, in particular those aged 18 to 24,surveys show, is more likely to feel lonely than any other – more even than Poles over 75. In 2024, almost two in five young mensaid they had nothad sex for at least a year. Abstinence, too, has become partisan: right-leaning men and left-leaning women are the likeliest to be sexually inactive.Young Poles aren’t just sleeping apart –they’re scrolling apart. Seven in 10 have tried the lottery of dating apps.But the promise of infinite possibilityappears to have delivered infinite hesitation: only 9% of young couples haveactually metonline. What appears, in statistics, as a fertility crisis seems, in lived experience,to be a crisis of connection.Gender wars – stoked by political polarisation, the bias of dating algorithms and the clash between autonomy and intimacy – have swept across much of the world. But in post-communist Europe, the conflict feels more acute. Three forces combine to set the region apart: the dizzying speed of change, the rise of psychotherapy as a new cultural grammar and the legacy of communism itself.Few regions have transformed with such vertigo. Since 1990, GDP per capita in Poland has riseneightfold, even adjusting for the cost of living. Since 2002, unemployment hasfallenfrom 20% to 2.8%. Prosperityhas alteredboth daily life and consciousness, upending generational life patterns and sparking a reckoning between the genders.Changing times entail changing mores. They also complicate the intergenerational exchange.My grandma, who left school at 10, urged me to skip going to university at Cambridge lest I lose my sweetheart; my mum, who was one of the first college-educated nurses in our town, rooted for me to go but warned against the UK student loan, insisting that “it’s wrong to live in debt” – as if it were an aberration rather than a cornerstone of the new economic order.Far away in Kraków, at the opposite end ofPoland– and of the social ladder – my partner’s parents, erudite professors, pressed him to polish his master’s thesis rather than risk launching a business that would one day thrive. For many of my friends, adulthood meant not learning from parents but explaining the world to them.The family, once imagined as Poland’s unbreakable core, has begun to fray. When theBerlin Wall fell,less than 6%of children were born out of wedlock – almost five times fewerthan in Britain. But as that generation came of age, many chose distance over duty. Data on estrangement remain imperfect, but by one estimate up to one in four Poles under 45 has no contact with their father; up to one in 13 is cut off from their mother. (In Britain, around one in fivehas no contactwith a family member.) When parents no longer serve as role models, stepping into parenthood yourself becomes an act of improvisation.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Raised on an low-calorie emotional diet, many Poles have turned to psychotherapy. A decade ago, it was taboo. Today, public health providers report a145% surgein psychological consultations in 10 years. Private practitioners, where most patients actually seek help, boast ofgrowth ratesthat would make venture capitalists envious. The shift is cultural as much as clinical: at glossybusiness summits, the keynote is as likely to be Esther Perel as it is a billionaire founder. Parliamentnow debateshow to regulate what critics call the wild west of the psychotherapeutic industry, where virtuosos of soul-searching mingle with pedlars of life hacks.But the22% of Poleswho rushed to couches in the past five years are disproportionately young, female and unmarried. They emerge fluent in the language of “self-care”, “needs” and “boundaries”, directed toward men who often respond in the idiom of “duties”, “norms”, and “expectations”.Behind these intimate dramas lies a paradox peculiar to post-communist Europe: it is at once more and less gender-equal than the west. Communism, in rejecting the bourgeois model of the family, propelled women into full employment and higher education, a policy that left Poland with one of the EU’ssmallest gender-pay gaps. By the 1980s, women alreadyoutnumbered menat universities. Yet in the private sphere – marriage, domestic labour, child-rearing – conservative norms endured. When women still seek partners with equal or higher status, but in a society where they get two out of three university diplomas, the numbers no longer add up.Men and women are literally in different places too: internal migration has shifted the balance so that in the country’s largest cities – such as Warsaw, Łódź and Kraków – there are at least 110 womenfor every 100 men. Men are more likely to stay in smaller towns, away from the new economy and new norms.And so, Poland’s baby deficit is not something that can be remedied with cash bonuses, cheaper mortgages or subsidised creches. What’s faltering in the first place is not the willingness to raise a child but the capacity to build a life with someone.Beneath Poland’s economic boom lurks what could be called the new generation’s Ingmar Bergman moment: a quiet crisis not of war or want, but of silence – of how to live together, how to find each other, how to sustain intimacy in a nation where people have learned all too well how to thrive on their own.Anna Gromada is an assistantprofessorat the Polish Academy of Sciences in Warsaw and a policy adviser to international organisations.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Protests at the ICE detention center in Portland, Oregon, in recent months have reflected the city’s penchant for whimsy and weirdness, and tactics such asnaked bike riding,organized public knittingand “ICE fishing” with doughnuts have largely remained a local affair.But when a federal agent in riot gear ran up behind a protester wearing an inflatable frog costume and sprayed a chemical agent directly into his costume’s air vent with all the casual menace of an exterminator, the inflatable frog went viral. “I’ve definitely had spicier tamales,” the 24-year-old protester, Seth Todd, told theOregonian, cementing the frog’s status as a leftist folk hero.The resistance 2.0 has a new visual language, and this time it’s polyester, battery-powered and full of hot airSoon, activists had launched “Operation Inflation” to equip Portland protesters with an entire menagerie of inflatable animal suits, and the costumes beganappearing at other protest hotspots, including the ICE detention center near Chicago where police have deployed teargas, pepper balls and batons against protesters in recent weeks. By the time millions of Americans took to the streets inlast weekend’s No Kings marches, inflatable costumes were ubiquitous.“I obviously started a movement of people showing up looking ridiculous, which is the exact point,” Toddsaid. “To show how the narrative that is being pushed [that] we are violent extremists is completely ridiculous.”View image in fullscreenSeth Todd, dressed in an inflatable flog costume, watches as Department of Homeland Security officers detain a protester outside an ICE facility  in Portland, Oregon, on 2 October.Photograph: Jenny Kane/APMove over pussy hats. Step aside safety pins. The resistance 2.0 has a new visual language, and this time it’s polyester, battery-powered and full of hot air. The colorful costumes lent a festive air to the No Kings protests and offered an implicit rebuke to the Trump administration’s attempt to smear his political opponents as violent terrorists.“Frivolity and absurdity are kryptonite to authoritarians who project the stern father archetype to their followers,” wrote author Gary Shteyngart in aNew York Times op-edcelebrating the profusion of playful and joyful imagery at Saturday’s marches. “Once the pants are lowered and the undies of the despot are glimpsed, there is no point of return.”It’s a lovely idea, but nine months into the second Trump administration, it’s hard to argue that Americans have yet to catch sight of the president’s dirty laundry. Kryptonite, like the emperor’s new clothes, is just a fairytale. As Americans seek to harness the energy of No Kings and direct it toward building an effective opposition to Trump’s authoritarian agenda, it’s worth considering what the inflatable costumes are actually saying.Street protest movements have many aims and many outcomes, but one of the most important is the production of imagery that conveys a message and outlasts the event itself. Activists are keenly aware of symbolism and optics – they aren’t called “demonstrations” for nothing – and often work to imbue protest aesthetics with their particular ideological and ethical commitments.Nonviolent resistance movements tend to adopt aesthetics that emphasize the inherent dignity and humble humanity of their members. From the Sunday best donned by marchers in the US civil rights movement to the simple dhoti worn by Gandhi and the modest white dress shirt and black slacks of theTiananmen Square Tank Man, aesthetic choices by peaceful protesters are an effective way of manufacturing imagery that, by contrast, illustrates the sadism and brutality of an oppressive state.The rejection of respectability politics by subsequent generations of Black liberation activists in the US – from the Black Panther party to Black Lives Matter – reflected not just an aesthetic but also an ideological shift. The Panthers were not seeking equality within a white supremacist system, but a revolution of the system itself; their signature berets, black leather jackets and firearms asserted their militancy and tied them visually to other leftwing revolutionary movements around the world.View image in fullscreenA protester dressed as a clown passes a riot police squad during a rally against the authorities’ harassment of migrants at the Sonnenblumenhaus in Rostock, Germany, on 4 June 2007.Photograph: Kay Nietfeld/EPARebel clowning or “tactical frivolity” represents a another aesthetic tradition of protest, one that deploys humor and buffoonery to pierce the aura of invincibility relied on by despots and dictators. From Charlie Chaplin’s lampooning of Adolf Hitler in the 1940 film The Great Dictator to theClandestine Insurgent Rebel Clown Army(Circa) protests against globalization and capitalism in the early 2000s, clowning has a storied history within leftwing and antifascist resistance movements.“The clown puts their absurd body in the way of the harm of others. It is politically more expensive to club a clown!” wrote performance artist LM Bogad in a 2020essayabout his experience with Circa. Confrontations between clowns and riot police create what Bogad calls “irresistible images” – “images that are so compelling that our ideological opponents cannot help but reproduce them even though they undermine their worldview and support ours”.What is ridiculously effective in front of an ICE detention center can end up looking just a bit ridiculous when there is no dangerPortland’s inflatable frogs fit squarely into this tradition, co-opting and subverting the aesthetic of intentional cruelty that has been so assiduously cultivated by the second Trump administration. Maga’s exaggeratedly sculpted faces andglorification of human miseryconvey the underlying ethos of the Trumpist worldview: beauty is pain, and pain beauty. When Donald Trump conjures up afalse image of Portlandas “war-ravaged” and “under siege” by antifa “terrorists”, he asks his supporters to embrace the cleansing power of state violence. But when federal agents and riot cops are forced to carry out their attacks on inflatable cartoon characters rather than figures clad in theall-black uniformof recent iterations of antifascist activism, government forces are enlisted in the project of debunking their own lies.But there is a difference between facing down a riot cop outside an ICE detention center, and dancing in the streets during a permitted march on a sunny Saturday morning. When a Vietnam war protester placedflowers down the barrels of rifleswielded by military police at the 1967 march on the Pentagon, or when anti-occupation activistsclucked like chickensbefore IDF soldiers in the West Bank, they clowned in the face of real danger. Without the implicit threat of state violence, without the bravery of offering up a comically unprotected body as a target for real violence, tactical frivolity can devolve into little more than entertainment.View image in fullscreenA anti-Vietnam war protester places single flowers into the gun barrels of military police officers as a gesture of peace in 1967.Photograph: P Conklin/TPX/Rex FeaturesThere are very good reasons to hold family-friendly protests away from the threat of riot cops, but different contexts require different tactics; what is ridiculously effective in front of an ICE detention center can end up looking just a bit ridiculous when there is no danger in the frame.Already, one mainstream media outlet haspublishedan affiliate link-laden article promoting cheap inflatable costumes on Amazon: “You too can join in on the movement today with this steeply discounted inflatable elephant costume that’s less than $20 – a record-low price, according to Amazon.” Similarly, the aesthetics of the flower power movement were adopted and commodified by the fashion industry over and over again, losing political potency along the way. The revolution may well end up being televised, but it is sure as hell not going to arrive in a cardboard box with free shipping from Amazon Prime.When activists turn rifles into vases and riot cops into zookeepers, they are interrupting the cycle of escalating tensionIt is also worth keeping in mind that Trump is not a straightforward “stern father” autocrat. While some of his rhetoric and actions invoke violence and terror against disfavored groups, he has also played the role of his own court jester, to great effect. His disinhibited remarks and frequent buffoonery are doing their own work to disarm and discredit his opponents, who have often struggled to convince the broader public of the seriousness of the threat he poses. So while tactical frivolity certainly has the power to deflate the menace of the Department of Homeland Security’s anti-immigrant security apparatus, it is not clear that it has much to offer when confronting Trump directly. After the No Kings protests, the presidentposted an AI-generated videoof himself dumping shit on protesters; it’s impossible to make him look like more of a clown than he already is.The massive No Kings protests may mark a new American political posture | Moira DoneganRead moreFinally, remember that clowning is a fundamentally de-escalatory tactic. When activists turn rifles into vases and riot cops into zookeepers, they are interrupting the cycle of escalating tension that can turn protests into dangerous confrontations. We absolutely need to de-escalate the violence that is being aimed at immigrants and other disfavored communities by Trump, ICE, DHS and the national guard – but it’s not clear to me that de-escalation is the right tactic for nationwide, popular protests. The Democratic party leadership has overwhelmingly failed to operate as an actual opposition party since Trump’s re-election; they don’t need to calm down, but to wake up.So please, wear your inflatable frog costume if you plan to use your body to obstruct the workings of Trump’s violent deportation machine: in addition to provoking irresistible images, it might helpprotect you against teargasand pepper spray. But let us be strategic about deploying tactical frivolity against Trumpism. When millions of people take to the streets to demand that our leaders and institutions stop capitulating, the message should not be mistaken for anything other than deadly serious.Explore more on these topicsProtest (US)OpinionPortlandOregonWest CoastUS immigrationICE (US Immigration and Customs Enforcement)Trump administrationcommentShareReuse this content"

This appears to be just another 21st-century development in a major city, a development that a builder has made a tidy profit out of, and flats that will have inevitably been snapped up by landlords and rented out at the highest market rate.But look a little closer, and things are different.There are more children, more families than you would find in a development like this in London. People seem to know one another, neighbours greet each other warmly and are sitting together outside, rather than dashing to the metro station with earbuds jammed in.Inside, some of the flats are arranged in clusters: eight bedrooms opening out into a communal space where neighbours cook, chat and share meals. There are a larger number of working class, poorer and ethnic-minority residents than you might expect to find in a development like this in a major city.This isthe Mehr als Wohnen cooperativein Zurich, Switzerland: a collection of 13 blocks of apartments that represent a different way of developing housing in major cities across the country.The buildings are all owned by a cooperative, which developed them. And the cooperative is owned by the people who live in the flats and have bought a share in the business. The result is no landlord, no speculative property developer, no soaring housing prices, no profit, no need for evictions and a structure that supports genuinely affordable housing and communal living. The cooperative includes shops, workspaces, a restaurant, a children’s nursery and a hotel. It has a no-car policy, supplemented by electric car and ebike rental systems. It could not feel more different from the UK.In many parts of the world, a cooperative such as this is not some kind of utopian dream. Actually, it’s the primary means societies from Scandinavia to South America use to provide housing for people who can’t afford outright market rates. Zurich is fast becoming a modern exemplar of how to use this model to build a different kind of city.One in every five citizensin Zurich now lives in a cooperative – meaning they have bought a share in the company that built and owns their apartment block. This means that despite being a major global financial hub and pleasantly located on the edge of a large lake, poorer, younger people, families and students can still find somewhere they can afford in the centre of the city.The model today involves members buying a returnable share between 7,000 and 25,000 Swiss francs (about £6,500 to £23,500) to join a cooperative and get a home. They then pay a “cost rent” which reflects the cost of repaying debts and maintaining the property.Swiss cooperative housing has a long history. The movement began in the late 19th century, through workers’ movements pooling their wealth to buy houses that could offer them security amid the housing speculation which was starting to take off in urban areas. In Zurich, the city’s first housing cooperative, Waidberg, was founded in 1907, and others soon followed, includingAllgemeine Baugenossenschaft Zürich (ABZ), which was founded in 1916, when 15 members started paying 20 cents each into an account. As soon as enough money had been raised, a new house would be built. ABZ still exists today, owning 5,000 homes which house 12,000 people.The movement grew after the second world war, supported by national and local governments, which offered favourable land leases and loans. The businesses became more sophisticated from the 1990s onwards, clubbing together to raise development finance. A full-scale renaissance of the movement kicked off in Zurich in 2011 after a city-wide referendum set a target that a third of the city’s housing be cooperative-owned by 2050.Since then, cooperatives have had priority access to land that is either leased to them by the city or gifted. They get low-interest loans and favourable treatment in the city’s zonal planning system. They also have access to some globally respected architects, with the developmentsgaining a reputationfor being “examples ofoutstanding architectural and ecological quality”.In some instances, the city also buys up to 20% of the shares in a cooperative, which gives it rights to housing that it then offers to homeless households for lower rents.The cooperatives are allsigned up to a joint charterwhich demands the adoption of principles such as “no speculative profits, good-quality affordable and sustainable housing, integration of disadvantaged households and tenant participation and self-determination”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This can be difficult: managing a building is hard, and the democratic model is a commitment of time that UK citizens would not be used to. But it does mean that decisions about their buildings are taken by them – not imposed by a landlord or freeholder.It is also not always an easy model to make work financially: older buildings will eventually need improvement work, which causes rents to rise. And for newly built projects, rising construction costs have pushed up rents, while a scarcity of land means growth is slowing and demand is outstripping supply.This has led to accusations that they are not affordable, and in fact cater to wealthier renters and drive gentrification. Even with these flaws, the model is cheaper than it would have been if a landlord’s profit margin also needed to be factored in.Could such a model work in the UK? There is no reason to think it wouldn’t. Indeed, there isan existing networkof small, thriving cooperatives here, which trace their history back decades.Part of the reason why it has never become mainstream is that we arguably did something better – council housing – so we didn’t need it to grow. But with social housing provision stalling and housing demand higher than ever, the cooperative model provides a glimpse of an alternative to our broken system. It is one we could at least explore.Peter Apps is a contributing editor atInside Housingand the author ofShow Me the Bodies: How We Let Grenfell HappenExplore more on these topicsEuropeThe housing crisis in EuropeHousingSwitzerlandCommunitiescommentShareReuse this content"

But after nearly four years of fighting, it may be the best optionThu 23 Oct 2025 09.30 EDTLast modified on Thu 23 Oct 2025 18.45 EDTShareOn Wednesday, President Trump imposedsubstantial new sanctionson Russia’s giant oil and gas companies, and lifted restrictions on the use of certain long-range missiles by Ukraine, which will now be able to strike more freely into Russia itself. These moves come on the heels of Trump’s conversations last week with Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelenskyy, after which the US president expressed his frustration at both side’s intransigence. Trump had hoped to end this war long ago. Will this be enough?When Russia launched its full-scale invasion ofUkrainein February 2022, the US and its allies chose a strategy that aimed to use Washington’s awesome political, economic and military power to impose such high costs on Russia that the Kremlin would sue for peace on Ukraine’s terms. This “cost-imposition” strategy makes sense in theory. The problem is that, in practice, it has slowed Russia’s progress but not persuaded Putin to end his aggression.Despite multiple rounds of sanctions, more advanced weapons for Ukraine and Ukraine’s own development of more capable weapons such as drones, Russia is still far from capitulation.It now occupies more of Ukrainethan it did three years ago. In February the war will enter its fifth year of fighting – just a few months shy of the length of the first world war.For advocates of the cost-imposition strategy, the answer is clear:more pressure.Specifically, they want an indefinite commitment to more sanctions, more weapons for Ukraine (such as Tomahawk missiles, which the US has so far refused to supply) and the seizure of frozen Russian assets in Europe. Yet more such measures are alone unlikely to provide the shock that would be needed to fundamentally change the trajectory of the war and force the Kremlin to capitulate to Ukraine’s negotiating terms.The oil and gas sanctions just announced increase the pressure, but they come after years and years of sanctions to which Russia has adjusted. The EU is on its 19th package of sanctions on Russia, and the returns are diminishing, with China’s backing for Moscow damping their effect. Few military experts, meanwhile, believe that additional weapons, even the powerful Tomahawk, would have adecisive impacton the war. Back in 2023, Ukraine successfully pleaded for Abrams tanks on the grounds they would turn the tide, but they didnothing of the sort. The long-awaited F-16s were alsonot the magic bulletsome expected – nor was last year’srelaxation of restrictionson Ukraine’s long-range strikes into Russia.There’s also a logical flaw with the “cost-imposition” strategy of how to end the war. On the one hand, proponents of more pressure often claim that serious negotiations now are pointless because Putin is determined to subjugate all of Ukraine. On the other hand, they claim that marginal increases in military or economic pressure will somehow cow him. But if Putin is really hell-bent on dominating all of Ukraine, then why should we expect upping the pressure a little to make a difference?To be sure, the US and its allies have good reasons to impose serious costs on the Kremlin.Russiahas rightly felt the economic and military pain, enough to get the attention of other would-be aggressors worldwide. Without western support, Ukraine would have struggled mightily to prevent Russian forces from entering Kyiv and ousting Zelenskyy. Pressure of this kind is an important ingredient in getting to a ceasefire. But it’s not sufficient in itself.So, don’t expect these additional sanctions to end the war any time soon – unless they are combined with a more open negotiating position from the west. This may mean a deal somewhat more favourable to Russia than the west would prefer. If the war were to end, for example, with Russia occupying the Donbas, it would be an unfair outcome for Ukraine and frustrating for its backers – but still better than many alternatives.Some ostensible supporters of Ukraine may secretly prefer to keep the war going, for example, to ward off the Russian threat by tying it down in Ukraine. But several years with no progress should lead the rest of us to reassess what US power can actually achieve in Ukraine at acceptable costs. Unwillingness to recognise and accept the limits of US power is a refrain that runs through the histories of Washington’s involvement in Vietnam, Iraq and Afghanistan.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

What if we could make seabirds resistant to the flu that has beenexterminating them en masse, just by tweaking their DNA a smidgen? Or make fish that can shrug off pollution, or coral that can survive warming waters? Engineer in the sorts of change thatcouldoccur naturally, given enough time, if only the wildlife would stop dying already.Thanks to newly emerging methods, such asCrispr, these feats are within reach. Recently, conservationists met at the International Union for Conservation of Nature’s (IUCN) 2025 World Conservation Congresswhere they debated GM wildlife and voted on a proposed moratorium thatwould stymietheir release into the wild. Ahead of the meeting, a group of more than 90 NGOs issued apress releaseurging the IUCN to “say no to engineered wild species.” But humans have been altering the DNA of other species for millennia.It all began about30,000 years ago, when our species started to domesticate wild animals. When we invited them into our world, slowly but surely, the grey wolf morphed into the dog, the red jungle fowltransformed intothe chicken and the aurochs gave way to domestic cattle.Then, a few hundred years ago, people started to deliberately breed their most desirable animals together. By repeating the process across generations, key features became exaggerated. Cattle became meatier. Pigs became longer. Dogs took on distinctive features which are now identifiable as dachshunds, dalmatians and dobermans. Selective breeding, as it is known, led to the creation ofhairless cats,goldfish with quiffsandgoats that faint when they are surprised. No kidding.Allof these features are underpinned by changes to the animals’ DNA. We may not have modified their genetics by design, but when we select for specific characteristics, the related DNA sequences hitch along for the ride. Over time, this leads to genetic change.It doesn’t stop there, however. As I point out in my book,Life Changing: How Humans are Altering Life on Earth, human activity is nowaltering the DNA ofalllife on Earth. Before our species evolved, life was shaped by natural forces. Evolution and the genetic change that goes with it tended to happen slowly across many millennia.Now, as we warm our world, pollute our planet and destroy the few wild places we have left, we are causingevolution to accelerate. Genetic change is being witnessed on timescales ofdecades and centuries. Central Park’s white-footed mice have acquiredversions of genesthat help them toprocess fatty foodsand afungus found on mouldy nuts. It seems they have evolved the ability to eat pizza and peanuts. Meanwhile, in Nebraska, American cliff swallows have evolvedsmaller wingsto help them dodge traffic, and in Puerto Rico, crested anole lizards have evolvedlonger legs and stickier toesto help them cling to buildings.If altering the DNA of wild species is a line you feel should never be crossed, then I have news for you. That ship sailed long ago. Although the hi-tech methods of today’s scientists may be different, the end result – modified organisms with new characteristics and subtly different DNA – is the same.New technologies often spawn anxiety. When Robert Bakewell, the 18th-century agriculturalist who championed selective breeding, began his work with farm animals, critics said it was unnatural and potentially dangerous. The same concerns were later raised with Patrick Steptoe and Robert Edwards as they pioneered the development of IVF in the 70s. In the 90s, cloning expert Ian Wilmut received similarly short shrift when he unveiled the birth of Dolly the sheep.Then, selective breeding turned out to be useful. IVF led to the creation of happy, healthy babies. And cloning became adopted by the agricultural industry, which uses it to replicate elite breeding animals. Sometimes, methods that are initially perceived as new, artificial and unnerving, become accepted over time as they become familiar and are proven to be safe and helpful. The deliberate genetic modification of wildlife could be one of these methods.Those who raised their concerns at the IUCN conference were right to do so. One way that gene editing differs from traditional breeding methods is that it can be used to introduce entirely novel characteristics. For example, scientists have taken genes from jellyfish and coral and added them to zebrafish, to createfluorescent versions of the popular aquarium pets. Genes from different species can be mixed and matched, so it’s important to decide which changes are acceptable and which are off limits.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A technique calledgene driverewrites the traditional laws of inheritance by ensuring that a particular gene gets passed down to all offspring, rather than the usual half. This can be used to quickly spread helpful features, such as disease resistance, down the generations. But if researchers choose to modify a gene that curtails fertility, the same technique could be used to wipe out an entire species.Yet conservationists aren’t proposing to trick out the genes of wild species on a whim. Instead, they realise that in the midst of this current mass extinction, where150-200 speciesgo extinct every day, traditional conservation tools aren’t enough.So it was a win for conservation when IUCN members in Abu Dhabi chose to reject themoratoriumon releasing GM wild species and instead, accept apolicythat enables researchers to proceed with genetically modifying wildlife cautiously, with key decisions made on a case-by-case basis.Humans are the ones driving biodiversity loss amongallspecies. We have new tools that could help to address this travesty, so isn’t that at least worth exploring?Helen Pilcher is a science writer and the author ofBring Back the King: The New Science of De-ExtinctionExplore more on these topicsGMOpinionAnimalsFarmingConservationcommentShareReuse this content"

This week, the Guardian revealed that one of the first people deported under the treaty had found his wayback to the UKvia a small boat. On the same day, Home Office data revealed that the number of people who had made the journey so far this year – 36,886 – had surpassed the total for 2024. The usual partisan recriminations followed. Opposition parties accuse Labour of failing to grip the problem; ministers say they are burdened by a long legacy of Conservative mismanagement. Both things can be true.For all its deficiencies, Sir Keir’s deal with France recognises two facts that his Tory andReform UKopponents cannot accept. First, engagement with EU states is a sine qua non of functional migration policy. Second, without some legal mechanism for accepting refugees, desperate people will always gamble on the illegal ways.Kemi Badenoch and Nigel Farage are too committed to vilification – casting France as the enemy and refugees as criminals – to engage with those propositions. They refuse to acknowledge the humanity of people who put their lives at risk to enter Britain illegally. Worse, they have policies to undermine the position of millions of people who have settled in the country by legal means.The target for both Reform UK and the Conservatives is indefinite leave to remain (ILR) – residency status that confers rights and access to state services short of the privileges of citizenship. Mr Farage proposesscrapping ILRand imposing tougher conditions on those currently on track to qualify. The Tory policy is much more extreme, retroactively revoking ILR from anyone who has claimed any form of state benefit or fallen below an annual income threshold of £38,700. This would strip residency rights from hundreds of thousands, quite possibly millions, of people, thereby making them liable to be deported.The result would be removals on an epic scale. In terms of total number and as a proportion of overall population, the displacement would exceed theexpulsionof Ugandan Asians by Idi Amin’s military dictatorship in 1972. The comparison is not one that many Conservative MPs welcome. Some appear to have been unaware until this week that their own policy is that monstrous, discovering its content only when Katie Lam, a junior shadow Home Office minister, spelled it out in anewspaper interviewlast Sunday. But the ILR revocation regime was proposed in an opposition “draft bill” presented to parliament in May.Ms Lam’s interview clarified that the motive for removing so many apparently undesirable people, regardless of whether they call Britain their home, would be “cultural coherence”. There are fringe parties of the far right that are less explicit in their intention to engineer demographic homogeneity by means of mass expulsion. There is also, thankfully, no evidence that the British public supports such an ambition.The political pressure to deal with illegal migration across the Channel is real andLabourwill pay an electoral price if it fails on that score. But a policy of redefining millions of people’s neighbours, friends and family as illegal migrants in order to drive them out of the country should disqualify the party proposing it from debate in a civilised democracy.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

They came to Morecambe? Wow, imagine that.” The town’s seafrontDomevenue closed 15 years ago. But this is not the only reason why the Lancashire town has dropped off touring schedules. A trend that sees live music increasingly concentrated in big cities means that it has become less accessible to musicians and audiences who don’t live in them.A combination of factors, including the pandemic, rising energy costs and disputes over noise, has left manysmaller, independently owned venues struggling– or even forced to close. In 2023, a net total of125 across the UKwere lost. Festivals, with their temporary stages and pop-up campsites, have also become sparser. Between 2019 and 2024,161 shut up shop.At the top end of the market, it is a different story. While the number of stops on the typical tour has shrunk, profits from thearena and stadium spectacularsthat turn cities into temporary fan conventions are booming. In 2023, live music revenue in the UK wasa record £1.63bn. Manchester’s new arena will soon be joined by others inBristolandCardiff.This stark divergence between the fortunes of the biggest stars and corporations, and thestruggling grassrootsgives force to arguments made by the Music Venue Trust, which champions small venues. It calls them “the R&D division of the entire industry”. Last year, MPs on the culture select committee agreed and gave their support to a scheme that adds a £1 levy to big-venue tickets – with funds distributed among smaller ones.Such places should not be valued solely for their role in nurturing future superstars. Live music has an intrinsic value andvenuescan be part of a town’s identity. A scheme to put them into community ownership has had striking success, with five secured so far and fundraising under way for nine more.Issues with the music industry’s pipeline go beyond reduced access to gigs, and include cuts to music education as well as youth clubs. Up-and-coming performers also need access to studios. Meanwhile, theticket inflationthat puts concerts out of reach for some is linked to the upheaval in industry finances brought about by streaming – which has made artists more reliant on touring. Recent years have seen growingconcerns around pricing models, resales and the enormous power wielded by two companies – Live Nation Entertainment (which owns Ticketmaster) and AEG (whose ticketing arm is AXS). In the US, Live Nation isfacing an antitrust casebrought by the government.So far, Live Nation has declined to throw its weight behind the UK’s £1 levy project. MPs as well as artists should apply pressure in any way that they can. The scheme’s backers are right to push for the industry’s behemoths to take more responsibility for those lower down the chain. The levy will not solve every problem. Nor should it be seen as an alternative to public funds – the decision by Arts Council England last month to funda new, grassroots-led music festivalis also worth celebrating. But those in the industry who are trying to do something about its top-heavy shape should be supported. Live music in more places would be a good thing.Explore more on these topicsMusic industryOpinionPop and rockTicket pricesConsumer affairsTicketmasterArts Council EnglandeditorialsShareReuse this content"

I assume that in Labour’s contortions to satisfy the Reform UK-driven agenda, some civil servant checked this out before the policy announcement was made. So is this a ruse to be able to continue to recruit the desperately needed staff for the NHS and the care sector while appearing to pander to the far right?If only the government could find the right words to explain that immigration is essential for all the flagging developed economies with declining birth rates, and that anti-immigration rhetoric has always been a manipulative distraction from the real issues of inequality and deregulation.Given the clumsy, tin-eared communication coming out of this government, eroding support for Labour and widening the field for Reform in such an alarming manner, it seems that it’s the policymakers who need an A-level qualification rather than immigrants coming to make an essential contribution to Britain.Pam MarshallRetired English teacher, SheffieldNesrine Malik exposes Labour’s latest set of hurdles for immigrants for the spiteful, silly nonsense that they are. I’ve been wondering particularly how someone working and grappling with learning English to a standard equivalent to A-level will fit in volunteering – usually a daytime activity and requiring commitment and training.But one option sounds perfect: we are certainly in need of fresh blood in this country, so why not mandate blood donation? Or perhaps that would be taking integration too far for the home secretary, Shabana Mahmood.Christine LehmanRipon, North YorkshireIf migrants are to be required to speak, read and write English to A-level standard, they may well become better qualified than those who teach it to them. The English requirement for postgraduate study in many UK universities is an International English Language Testing Systemscore of 6.5. This is comparable to grade A or B at GCSE, significantly below A-level standard. Or is the “A-level” requirement simply to deter those wanting to gain permanent residence?Bryn JonesBathLearning a completely different language to a high standard is very difficult. My son has a Cambridge English degree and teaches young children from several countries. He is one of the cleverest people I know, but he tells me that he simply could not learn Tamil, with its 247 characters and complex grammar.Maybe we have to accept that others might also struggle with the difference between their language and English. Functional spoken English and technical English, as required by a job, should be sufficient. That will, of course, be a high standard in some jobs.Peter WestLondonHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

(The year with the most Scots acts on the shortlist was also the year with the most Scotland-based judges.)But this is an inevitable result of London’s long and increasingly dominant place in the arts business and, for example, the decline of BBC local radio – early panels included local radio DJs.The table published with your article assigned acts to regions according to where “they are generally recognised to have started their careers”, but it is hardly surprising that musicians, wherever they come from, move to London for such a start.It is certainly the case that there has been something of a London-centric movement if you look at Mercury winners: by my reckoning, in the first 10 years only two of the winners came from London; since then, the statistic is 12 winners from London to 10 from everywhere else. But then this reflects the creativity of London’s black music scene, which provided nine of the 12 winners.Simon FrithHexham, NorthumberlandHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Elland Road is a wonderfully atmospheric ground but given the local traffic congestion, getting there, particularly on a Friday evening, is invariably tortuous. The prospect of exacerbating that gridlock dictates that the club’s plans to expand Elland Road to 53,000 appear in potential jeopardy. Leeds city council will make a final, delayed, decision on the project on 27 November but, with 65% of the team’s fans driving to matches, there is concern about the inevitable extra traffic chaos. The club hope to reduce the percentage of match-bound car travel to 51%, but to do that public transport needs to improve; Leeds is the biggest city in western Europe without a metro system. Cycling? Anyone familiar with the area’s topography knows it is not a realistic option for the vast majority of fans.Louise TaylorLeeds v West Ham, Friday 8pm BST2Guiu can shine in Black Cats reunionMarc Guiu started the season at Sunderland, having found himself out of Enzo Maresca’s plans and needing to learn about life in the Premier League after a slow first year in England. As a teenager arriving from Barcelona’s La Masia, it was not a surprise that the striker needed time to adapt even if he made a few cameos along the way before the Black Cats came calling. Then Liam Delap got injured and Chelsea were in a bit of a vice, so brought back Guiu. Sunderland gave him two substitute appearances in the league and he scored only in the Carabao Cup exit to Huddersfield, suggesting he might not be primed for life at the top of the table. Since then, however, he has shown Maresca what he can do, playing a half in the win over Nottingham Forest andscoring against Ajax. He will want to continue on this trajectory.Will UnwinChelsea vSunderland, Saturday 3pm BST3On-song Newcastle give Silva much to fearFulham and their manager, Marco Silva, are unlikely to be deceived by the table. It shows that they are only one point behind Newcastle in its bottom half but, as José Mourinho emphasised this week, the latter’s position is hugely deceptive. Granted, Eddie Howe’s side have started the season slowly but they have kept seven clean sheets in 12 games in all competitions and, when the mood takes them, are almost unplayable. Inlosing 3-0 at St James’ Parkin the Champions League on Tuesday night Benfica did not perform badly. They restricted the centre-forward Nick Woltemade to one touch inside their box but, ultimately, they could not handle Howe’s wingers, Anthony Gordon in particular. “We could not compete with their horsepower, their intensity, speed and physicality,” said Mourinho. “This tells me a lot about Newcastle’s true level. They are a team of giants and they have four lightning-fast wingers.” Silva, a compatriot and a friend of Mourinho, has reason to be worried, particularly as Howe says there is “much more to come” from his reshaped side.LTNewcastle vFulham, Saturday 3pm BSTView image in fullscreenNick Woltemade will be seeking to get back on the scoresheet against Fulham.Photograph: Allstar Picture Library Ltd/Ed Sykes/Apl/Sportsphoto4Manchester United spy a (sort of) trebleYou have to rewind to August 2024 for the last time Manchester United won three league games in a row, when Erik ten Hag’s men carried momentum from May into the new season witha victory against Fulhamthanks to Joshua Zirkzee’s 87th-minute winner. After Sunday’s2-1 downing of Liverpool, which followed the 2-0 defeat of Sunderland, victory over Brighton at Old Trafford would match the feat. It would also suggest the start of a revival (maybe) under Ruben Amorim, but a loss would be morale-sapping and revive the doubts regarding the Portuguese’s skills.Jamie JacksonManchester United v Brighton, Saturday 5.30pm BST5A chance for Salah to reassert himselfAfter ending their four-game losing streakin Frankfurt, Liverpool need to reignite their title defence. Chelsea, Crystal Palace and Manchester United have secured 2-1 victories in Arne Slot’s past three domestic outings. The most notable change on Wednesday was leaving Mohamed Salah on the bench. The Egyptian has not scored for his club in more than a month, when he netted in the3-2 win over Atlético Madridon 17 September. He has not looked at his sharpest since the start of the season and it is understandable that, at 33, regardless of his natural fitness, he will need to be more carefully managed if Slot and Liverpool are to get the best out of him. A cameo in the Champions League kept him ticking over, although the game was very much done by the time he entered the pitch. Slot needs to decide whether to reinstall him into the starting lineup, which seems likely consideringAlexander Isak’s injuryand the prospect of being able to rest him for the visit of Crystal Palace in the Carabao Cup on Wednesday.WUBrentford vLiverpool, Saturday 8pm BST6Kroupi can take centre stage for CherriesEvanilson looks unlikely to return for third-placed Bournemouth’s match against Nottingham Forest. Instead, Eli Junior Kroupi, fresh from hisdouble at Crystal Palace, will almost certainly keep his place in the side. The 19-year-old has three goals in five league appearances for Bournemouth and looks like another smart acquisition, made somewhat easier by sharing an owner with Lorient, from where the striker was bought. A return to the Breton club on loan last season resulted in 13 goals in as many games; money cannot buy that level of confidence. For a young player, he offers great composure in front of goal and quickly settles into a match when coming off the bench. Andoni Iraola knows he has an asset on his hands and that Kroupi needs minutes to develop. The striker will want to give his head coach reasons to keep starting him, whether Evanilson is available or not.WUskip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The 15-year-old who joined Arsenal in 2015 from local side Billericay Town – where his father, Rob, used to be a director – became the second youngest player in Premier League history this season and is understood to have attracted interest from several other top clubs. But his future at Arsenal was never seriously in doubt during negotiations that were handled by his father, with the scholarship terms due to begin next season after Dowman turns 16 on 31 December before he will be able to sign a professional contract when he is 17. After a busy but successful week for Arsenal, he could make a fourth appearance of the season againstCrystal Palaceon Sunday.Ed AaronsArsenal v Crystal Palace, Sunday 2pm GMT8Cash showing value at VillaHow many times have you replayed thatotherworldly Matty Cash ping? His sumptuous first-time pass to Lucas Digne proved the catalyst for Emi Buendía’s glorious winnerat Tottenham last weekend; Digne’s control and layoff were equally sublime, too. When Villa have struggled, Cash has been an easy target for criticism and there has long been an expectation that Unai Emery will try to upgrade at right-back. But the Villa manager regards Cash as a reliable performer and has found it tricky to identify a realistic alternative who would represent an obvious improvement. Cash was wanted by his former club Nottingham Forest in the summer but Villa recognise his value, with the Poland full-back expected to sign a new contract in the coming months. Morgan Rogers, another player the club are keen to tie down, is the only one of Cash’s teammates to have played more league minutes this season.Ben FisherAston Villa vManchester City, Sunday 2pm GMT9Huge pressure on downbeat WolvesIt is a good job messages on the WhatsApp supporters channel Wolves launched this week will be permitted only one way. Plenty of fans are angry, others are apathetic, and many are resigned to relegation after taking two points from their opening eight matches. Wolves have failed to win any of their first eight league games for a second straight season, the first team to achieve that unwanted feat since Sunderland in 2015-16 and 2016-17, when the Black Cats finished bottom. Stamford of the Southern LeaguePremier LeagueCentral are the only other team in English football’s top seven tiers without a win this campaign. The visit of Burnley on Sunday feels bigger than the proverbial six-pointer for Vítor Pereira’s side. “We understand the frustration, and we just have to take it on the chin as players until we turn it around,” said the defender Matt Doherty.BFWolves vBurnley, Sunday 2pm GMTView image in fullscreenVítor Pereira, Wolves’s head coach, finds himself in a sticky situation.Photograph: Richard Lee/Shutterstock10Everton rebuild still a tough task for MoyesSean Dyche’s return to management this week offered a little reminder of how far Everton have moved on since the grimmest period of his tenure. That was not the sequence of one win in 11 dreadful league matches that cost Dyche the Everton job in January but the financial turmoil that preceded it and could easily have resulted in relegation but for the former manager’s calm leadership. Everton are unrecognisable under David Moyes and The Friedkin Group and could go level on points with Tottenham should they inflict a first away defeat of the season on Thomas Frank’s team. Moyes knows improving Everton is an open-ended task but, with a difficult assignment against Spurs afterlast weekend’s defeat at Manchester City, he believes perspective on the recovery is required. “We are only just out of having 12 players out of contract, with PSR [profitability and sustainability regulations] issues, and we’re just done with that. We’ve moved to a new stadium. I would hope that if it didn’t all go to plan folk would say: ‘Well, there’s a few mitigating circumstances.’ Certainly this year. But I don’t want to use any of that as an excuse. I want us to try and challenge and the players know that as well.”Andy HunterEverton v Tottenham, Sunday 4.30pm GMTPosTeamPGDPts1Arsenal812192Man City811163AFC Bournemouth83154Liverpool83155Chelsea87146Tottenham Hotspur87147Sunderland83148Crystal Palace84139Man Utd8-11310Brighton811211Aston Villa801212Everton801113Brentford8-11014Newcastle80915Fulham8-4816Leeds8-6817Burnley8-6718Nottm Forest8-10519West Ham8-12420Wolverhampton8-112Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueTen things to look out for this weekendNewcastle UnitedFulhamBrentfordLiverpoolBournemouthNottingham ForestfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Unai Emery’s side looked on course to extend their winning streak to six matches in all competitions when they went ahead in the fourth minute through Evann Guessand. They missed a host of chances to finish the game, though, and came unstuck as goals from Mathis Suray and Mats Deijl either side of half-time gave Go Ahead Eagles a famous victory in one of the biggest games in their history.Nottingham Forest v Porto, Celtic v Sturm Graz and more: Europa League – liveRead moreThis was an unexpected blip in Villa’s quest to finish in the top eight of the league phase as Emery plots a fifthEuropa Leaguetitle, and after Emiliano Buendía missed a penalty late on to get his side back on level terms the head coach lamented that his side must be more clinical from the spot. It was also a disappointing night for Jadon Sancho, who failed to make a telling impact on the second start since his loan move from Manchester United and was withdrawn in the second half.Villa, who face an in-form Manchester City on Sunday, should still have enough to make it through the league phase of the competition, though their next match is against Maccabi Tel-Aviv in what has become ahugely politicised fixture.Go Ahead Eagles are a provincial club based 60 miles east of Amsterdam and were playing in the Dutch second tier as recently as 2021. The atmosphere in the 10,000-capacity De Adelaarshorst was raucous at the start of the match but Villa needed only minutes to quieten them down.Buendía fed Sancho down the left and his cross was clawed away by the home goalkeeper Jari De Busser, but only into the path of Guessand, who slotted into an empty net. It was his first goal in a Villa shirt following his £25m summer move from Nice.View image in fullscreenMats Deijl turns in Go Ahead Eagles’ winning goal from close range.Photograph: Hollandse Hoogte/ShutterstockVilla could have been out of sight with only 10 minutes on the clock but Ollie Watkins spurned a glorious chance after shooting straight at De Busser, who also saved Sancho’s shot following a jinking run into the penalty area.The visitors should definitely have been further ahead just before the half hour when Buendía played Guessand through on goal but the French forward dallied and saw De Busser block his effort.Emery’s side were in total control but were pegged back out of the blue before half-time. The Villa defence were unable to deal with a floated free-kick and the ball fell to Suray, whose shot took a huge deflection and looped into the top corner.The turnaround was complete 15 minutes into the second half as Deijl controlled Joris Kramer’s cross with his chest and the captain poked the ball past Emiliano Martínez.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They were handed the perfect chance to level in the 77th minute when Dean James handled in the area. However, with the wind and rain swirling, Buendía skied his penalty. Rogers curled a shot inches wide but a late rally was never on the cards and there was a post-match firework display as Go Ahead Eagles celebrated a memorable win.Buendía’s was Villa’s sixth missed penalty in the last 12 months, with Ollie Watkins missing against Bologna this season, while they also lost a penalty shootout to Brentford in the Carabao Cup last month. Emery said: “Today the responsibility was for Emiliano Buendia. And normally he has good numbers shooting penalties, but he missed. Of course, something can happen, and we will try to get more clinical in the penalty shoot than the last penalties we have had.“Our takers are clear. Buendia was today, Sancho, John McGinn, Morgan as well can shoot penalties. And, of course, Emiliano can repeat, but the idea is try to be so, so responsible about the decision and about the takers who can score.”Go Ahead Eagles had qualified by winning the Dutch Cup last season and this was another huge result. Deijl explained the historic nature of the win. “I think the last few years we’ve had a lot of big wins, the big one was, of course, the cup final,” the match-winner said. “I think everyone expected us to have a really hard time in Europe, and I don’t think anyone expected from us to do it like this. So we’re very happy. And of course, this might be the biggest win so far for this club here.”Explore more on these topicsEuropa LeagueAston VillaGo Ahead Eaglesmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

After his comprehensive victoryat the last round in Austin, Verstappen acknowledged that he waswell and truly back in the contest.Red Bull fined £43,000 after team member tries to tamper with Lando Norris grid tapeRead morePiastri, who has not finished in front of Verstappen for the past four rounds and managed no higher than third in that run, said the Dutchman’s resurgence had not been expected. “The run of form that he has had since Monza has been a bit of a surprise. There were flashes of that performance early in the season but also pretty big dips,” Piastri said. “He has come to the fight quicker than I expected.”However, Piastri insisted he remained confident despite the world champion’s run of form. “The gap has shrunk a bit in the last few races but the focus has always been on going as fast as I can,” he said. “I’d rather have the lead than be in any other spot. There is no benefit for me in worrying about that or focusing on that.”Verstappen added that he too had not expected to be fighting for the title, which he had believed was beyond him at the midway point of the season.“I’ve won championships very late, very early,” he said. “Now, this one, of course, is very different because I think for most of the season, it was a lot harder for us. To be honest with you, to still be in this fight is very surprising.“Now we need to be perfect but for me, it’s just positive pressure. I’m loving what I’m doing. If the car is competitive, much better to be racing in it than when it’s not. So every race that you do until the end, we can’t afford any bad luck or mistakes.”View image in fullscreenMax Verstappen’s dominant performance in Austin has added extra spice to this weekend’s Mexican Grand Prix.Photograph: Alessio De Marco/Zuma Press Wire/ShutterstockPiastri also cleared up McLaren’s position after he and Norris had clashed with each other in the last two rounds. After Norris barged into Piastri while overtaking in Singapore, McLaren said there would be “repercussions” for the Briton.In Austin last week, however, Piastri was at fault in a first corner incident with Norris in the sprint race. With Norris starting in second and Piastri in third, the Australian tried to cut back inside his teammate but in doing so was struck by the Sauber of Nico Hülkenberg. His move was risky given how crowded it can be at turn one at the Circuit of the Americas. The impact speared him into Norris at speed, lifted Piastri’s car into the air and entirely sheared off one of Norris’s wheels, damage that ended both their races.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

So, just going out and racing, and see who can come out on top.”He went on to confirm that any potential sanctions against Norris from his move at the Singapore Grand Prix would not be imposed. “The consequences on Lando’s side have been removed,” he said before confirming it was the aggressive nature of his cut-back in Austin that had been considered at fault. “Yes, ultimately it was that. There were a lot of factors involved but yes, ultimately, that’s what has been decided.”Meanwhile, it has emerged that the FIA has reinstated a former Russian general, under sanctions from the US, UK and Canada, to the governing body’s World Motorsport Council. Victor Kiryanov, who is head of the Russian Automobile Federation, had stepped down from his role on the WMC voluntarily when Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022 but returned to his position in June this year after the FIA approved the reinstatement of Russian and Belarusian officials “in the interests of fairness”.An FIA spokesperson said: “The FIA is a politically neutral body, governed by a democratically elected senate. Members of the world motorsport council are elected, and serve, in an individual capacity. The FIA has a longstanding commitment to upholding motor sport’s neutrality.“Its decision to allow all elected members, regardless of nationality, to continue serving their terms is in line with the approach of other international sports bodies.”Explore more on these topicsFormula OneOscar PiastriMax VerstappenMcLarenRed BullMotor sportnewsShareReuse this content"

Tactical trends in rugby are moving in the opposite direction though, and with Noah Caluori set to make his second Prem start, Northampton’s high-stakes meeting with Saracens on Friday night promises to be a battle in the skies.Phil Dowson’stable-topping Saints, champions in 2023-24, are the only unbeaten team remaining after three wins and a draw. Second-placed Saracens are two points back, having scored a league-leading 168 points to Northampton’s second-best 138. Nine players involved in England’s training camp this week will start at Franklin’s Gardens.The Breakdown | Caluori conundrum adds to Borthwick’s England selection headachesRead moreThere would be no shortage of intrigue, then, even before throwing the towering teenage figure of Caluori into the mix. The 6ft 5in wing scored five tries to demolish Sale last Saturday, prompting aninvitation from Steve Borthwickto Pennyhill Park before the autumn internationals and generatinga week of excitable headlines.Mark McCall, the Saracens director of rugby, said this match will test the 19-year-old’s readiness for the international game given the quality of opposition. But it is also likely to show how players with prodigious aerial ability are thriving after thecrackdown on escort defenders.“Because of the law change in terms of escorting and shielding … it has to be an attacking weapon,” McCall said, implying their intention is to rain contestable kicks down on Northampton’s defence. “It’s almost mad not to use it. Six years ago, kicking might have been seen as a negative thing. I think everyone’s woken up to the fact that in the current rules it can be a very positive thing.”Saints are known for a progressive approach: attacking space, offloading, seeking to stretch opponents with width. But Dowson recognises the game has changed and thatSaracenswill provide a specific test. “The kicking of Owen Farrell and Fergus Burke [against Sale] was outstanding,” he said. “Caluori’s ability to float through the air, to ‘fly’, effectively, means it’s very difficult. That’s one of the things the rule change of not blocking has opened up. It’s something we’re going to have to deal with.”Dowson welcomed his England contingent back to club duty on Thursday and all six start against Saracens. Fraser Dingwall will mark his 150th Northampton appearance at inside-centre, while at No 6 Alex Coles brings up his century of league games for the club. Tommy Freeman, Alex Mitchell and Fin Smith start in the backline while Henry Pollock – who whipped up his share of hype last season – may seek to reclaim attention from Caluori.View image in fullscreenFraser Dingwall will play his 150th match for Northampton on Friday.Photograph: David Rogers/Getty ImagesTheo Dan and Maro Itoje start in the Saracens pack, with Owen Farrell at No 12 and Caluori on the wing.

Is it a question of Saracens helping him navigate all the attention? “I think so,” he said. “He’s a great young man to work with. He’s got a lot of good people around him at the club and he works very hard at his game. He got to experience the England camp there for a couple of days as well. We’ll just crack on as we normally do with him.”Asked if he had been particularly impressed by Caluori’s maturity McCall took a wider view. “I’ve been surprised not just by him, but we’ve got quite a lot of players in their first year out of school in our senior academy now,” he said. “What I’ve started to notice is an increased maturity in all those players. More ready to play sooner than before, both physically and emotionally. I think our academy staff are doing a brilliant job.”As they aim to protect their unbeaten Prem record Dowson and his Northampton side, in turn, will have a job to do in trying to contain Caluori.Explore more on these topicsPrem RugbySaracensNorthamptonRugby unionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The recording is entitled “Day in the life of a pro footballer” but this is not the most enticing start. Will it be the usual run-of-the-mill offering about how a footballer has herbal tea, protein powder and a private chef to produce beans on toast?It will not, it turns out. If the key takeaways are that Haaland has maple syrup in his coffee, stands in front of red light to get vitamin D and is sickeningly talented on the barbecue, there is more besides when theManchester Citystriker invites the camera into his mansion of marble, clean edges and floor-to-ceiling windows. Maybe he is not permanently a footballer eager to mow down defenders on his way to scoring goals.Champions League review: A deluge of goals as youth rules for Barcelona and BayernRead moreA Shaun Wright-Phillips-sized teddy bear stands in the corner of the kitchen, confirmation perhaps that the grizzly Norwegian is actually cuddly, although his young child may have something to do with the stuffed toy. Like any sleep-deprived parent, Haaland starts with a coffee, suggesting it is a “superfood, if done right”. The expensive bit of kit implies he has been on a barista course but a Milanese coffee aficionado is unlikely to have added the maple syrup. Equally, they have not scored 24 goals in 14 games for club and country this season.Fried eggs and freshly delivered bread complete breakfast, all cooked by Haaland. It is refreshing to see his self-sufficiency, alongside his girlfriend, Isabel Haugseng Johansen. “I’ve been living alone since I was 16, so I have to cook,” he says. No ready meals for him.Soon City’s sports therapist Mario Pafundi – “flat arse” to Haaland – arrives. If you think Haaland starts his physical preparation once he reaches the training ground, you are wrong. By 9am Haaland and Pafundi are in the home gym for massage and soft tissue work to keep the striker’s groin flexible. Considering the clearly natural talent Haaland possesses, it is a reminder that little things matter at the top.View image in fullscreenErling Haaland with his red light machine to get vitamin D.Photograph: Tactica SàrlWith sunshine lacking in the Cheshire countryside, Haaland enjoys his spell in front of the gym’s red light machine. What is clearly not in short supply locally is red meat. A drive to nearby Greenoaks Farm allows Haaland to procure enough steaks to feed a team, together with raw milk (yes, seriously) and honey. He also stops to buy jars of bee nectar for the camera crew – a nice touch from the big man.The lean, mean goalscoring machine likes “fatty steaks the most”, which does not sound in keeping with nutritional advice – but just look at him. After a little bit of training in the rain, Haaland has earned his dinner. Grace Dent should possibly take over at this stage, as two tomahawk steaks are laid out, one marinaded, one just seasoned. It’s good news for the cameraman because surely Haaland and Isabel cannot see these off. While the meat marinades, so does Haaland in an ice bath, although that seems unnecessary given he has decided the only logical way of cooking a whole cow is on the barbecue outside.Isabel puts “half a mortgage of olive oil” on the salad, leading to a Mr Bean-esque raised eyebrow from the £500,000-a-week striker, who knows the high price of the precious liquid and must be a first pressing type of guy.The steaks hit the grill and Haaland, like any proud Yorkshireman, announces: “This is going to be absolutely lovely” – reminiscent of Fred Trueman preparing for a cup of tea. Surely Haaland has not spent his free hours down the years focusing on perfectingcuisson. “This is where the details are,” he says as he checks the meat. He creates a crusted and perfectly medium steak, eventually dispensing with cutlery to eat it.If we learn two things, it is that Haaland knows the minutiae are what make him a superhuman footballer and that he is human after all. And aspiring strikers remember: maple syrup in your coffee.Explore more on these topicsErling HaalandManchester CityfeaturesShareReuse this content"

However her performance was immediately questioned by many in the athletics world who felt it was too good to be true.Marathon world record holder Ruth Chepngetich suspended over banned substanceRead moreBut while the 31-year-old will not be able to race again until 2028, she will be allowed to keep her world record because her positive drugs test came after her run in Chicago. That will leave a sour taste in the mouth for many people. However, the AIU chair, David Howman, insisted that the case proved that “nobody is above the rules”.“While disappointing for those who put their trust in this athlete, this is how the system is supposed to work,” he added.Chepngetich had been due to run in this year’s LondonMarathonbut pulled out just days before after a urine test in March found an estimated concentration of 3,800ng/mL of the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) in her system – far above the legal limit of 20ng/mL.Diuretics may be abused to mask the presence in urine of other prohibited substances. However, when interviewed by AIU investigators in April, Chepngetich was unable to provide an explanation for her positive test.At a subsequent interview in July, the AIU said it then confronted her with evidence acquired from her mobile telephone indicating a reasonable suspicion that her positive test may have been intentional.Shortly afterwards, Chepngetich wrote to the AIU to state that she now recalled that she had been taken ill two days before the positive test – but had forgotten to mention it.“She claimed that she had experienced symptoms of sweating, weakness and tachycardia and, since she knew that her housemaid had experienced similar symptoms, asked her housemaid for the medicine that she had been taking,” the AIU investigation states.View image in fullscreenRuth Chepngetich of Kenya crosses the finish line to win the 2024 Chicago marathon.Photograph: Michael Reaves/Getty ImagesInvestigators found such claims to be “hardly credible” and asked for her potential suspension to be increased from two years to four. Chepngetich then accepted that she had committed an anti-doping rule violation and was banned for three years.That, though, may not be the end of the matter. The AIU said it had found screenshots on Chepngetich’s phone about the banned drug testosterone and “messages related to unidentified third parties working on ‘programs’ possibly related to doping”. “The case regarding the positive test for HCTZ has been resolved, but the AIU will continue to investigate the suspicious material recovered from Chepngetich phone to determine if any other violations have occurred,” said the head of the AIU, Brett Clothier.“In the meantime, all Chepngnetich’s achievements and records predating the 14 March 2025 sample stand.”Explore more on these topicsMarathonAthleticsDrugs in sportUS sportsKenyanewsShareReuse this content"

Ahead of Sunday’s edition of El Clásico between Barcelona and Real Madrid, the two clubs won their midweek matches. Real Madrid’s opponents were Juventus, in the type of heavyweight clash the Champions League’s rejig into a 36-team group stage was supposed to throw up on a regular basis. Wednesday’s meeting fell short of classic encounters like 2003’s meeting of Madrid’s Luís Figo and Zinedine Zidane with Juve’s Pavel Nedvěd and Alessandro Del Piero. In 2025, Juventus are not the force of yore, though they made Madrid sweat. The sole goal came from Jude Bellingham, England’s great enigma.Barcelona meanwhile, continue to show the depth of their La Masia youth academy. Fermín López, 22, scored a hat-trick, while 17-year-old attacking midfielder Pedro “Dro” Fernández supplied an assist on his Champions League debut in a6-1 drubbing of Olympiakos. Last weekend, Toni Fernández, six months younger than Pedro, started against Girona in La Liga. Each may play some part in Sunday’s big match, with Madrid two points ahead of their eternal rivals.If Tebas had only listened he might have got his La Liga game abroad | Sid LoweRead moreBayern Munich. Another European giant is enjoying a flowering of youth. On Tuesday, Bayern’s coach, Vincent Kompany signed a three-year extension after his side’s faultless start to the Bundesliga campaign. The club hierarchy approves of Kompany’s blooding of players like Lennart Karl and Wisdom Mike, two more 17-year-olds. Karl, whose muscular 5ft 6in frame recalls 1990s German great Thomas Hässler, completed a solo effort with a fine finish to become his club’s youngest ever Champions League scorer in a 4-0 thrashing of Club Brugge.“He simply has balls,” said teammate and midfielder Aleksandar Pavlović, who, at 21, is another youngster Kompany is trusting. Meanwhile, Harry Kane continued an incredible scoring run, and has now notched 20 goals in 12 games across all competitions this season. He has only failed to score in one of those games, and in that one he registered two assists. Meanwhile, Luis Díaz, the summer’s big signing, scored his first Champions League goal for Bayern. Díaz is making his best ever start to a season with seven goals and four assists from 12 matches.Premier League strength.This week saw a deluge of goals – 71 over two nights, 43 on Tuesday. This makes for a great highlights package, but questions of competitive balance may be raised. Five Premier League clubs enjoyed comfortable wins, including Liverpoolending their losing runby winning 5-1 at Eintracht Frankfurt. Newcastlebeating Benfica 3-0and Chelsea’s5-1 win over Ajaxwere punishing defeats for two classic clubs from the European Cup era. Arsenal’s4-0 defeat of Atlético Madridwas perhaps most striking. Mikel Arteta’s team were too powerful for Diego Simeone’s to withstand. The breakthrough, a Gabriel header, was their 10th set-piece goal this season.As Manchester Citywon 2-0 at Villarreal, Erling Haaland extended his scoring run to 12 matches, closing in on Robert Lewandowski’s run of 15 in 2021 – the best such mark this century. Letting the English side down wasTottenham’s 0-0 draw at Monaco, who took 21 shots on Guglielmo Vicario’s goal. A face in the crowd on Wednesday was Paul Pogba, yet to begin his comeback at Monaco from his drugs ban after another setback in training.Dazn targets rights for Champions League in latest football move involving Saudi ArabiaRead morePlayer of the weekDennis Man, PSV Eindhoven.The week’s most striking result was PSV’s 6-2 defeat of Napoli, with US striker Ricardo Pepi scoring as a substitute. It was Man, a Romanian winger, at the centre of things. He had two goals and a series of dribbles into the heart of the Italian champions’ defence. Man’s second goal, his team’s fourth, was the highlight, drilled with his left foot. The first was a delicate finish.“As I’ve said many times before, you shouldn’t write players off after a few weeks,” said the PSV coach Peter Bosz of a player criticised since signing from Parma.They said it“The biggest exception for me today compared to the other games we’ve played was the playing style of our opponent. We got some energy out of the moments we could press them, which in the last four or five games we played we were not able to press the opponent because the ball wasn’t on the ground, it was in the air.”– Liverpool manager Arne Slot comments on the win in Frankfurt, and inadvertently issues Brentford manager Keith Andrews his tactical plan for the team’s game on Saturday.

It feels like they still have room for improvement.”– France 1998 World Cup winner Emmanuel Petit, speaking on RMC after the defending champions won 7-2 at Bayer Leverkusen.Looking aheadThe fourth week throws up a real heavyweight clash as PSG face Bayern. The Parisians are not having it their way in Ligue 1, where Roberto De Zerbi’s Marseille are leaders; Marseille’s loss to Sporting Club on Wednesday had the Italian fuming. Bayern, after recent turbulence, are back dominating the Bundesliga. This one might well be a dry run for a higher stakes meeting in the latter stages.Real Madrid v Liverpool fits a similar bill – Xabi Alonso facing Slot, with the Basque Real Madrid boss having been many people’s pick to succeed Jürgen Klopp. In the Champions League era, Madrid have beaten Liverpool in two finals, though a 2-0 Liverpool win last November at Anfield in the group stage loosened Carlo Ancelotti’s tenure, a night when Kylian Mbappé and Mohamed Salah both missed penalties.In the early 1990s Sir John Hall, the Newcastle chair, revealed a dream for his club to become a “team full of Geordies”, modeled on Athletic Club’s Basque-only recruitment policy. That never came to pass, especially not today. Eddie Howe’s squad is a league of nations, with only Dan Burn, teenage midfielder Lewis Miley and reserve keeper Mark Gillespie fitting Hall’s bill. The clubs meet at St James’ after heartening wins this week. Wednesday saw Athletic land their first win with a 3-1 comeback against Qarabağ.Explore more on these topicsChampions LeagueBarcelonaBayern MunichfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The mountains will host key stages, with the Ventoux featuring in theTour de France Femmesfor the first time.A double stage finish to the ski station at Alpe d’Huez will provide the pivotal moment in the 113th running of the men’s race, whose route, along with the women’s event, was revealed in Paris on Thursday morning.‘I’m the total opposite to Cav and Brad’: Geraint Thomas on how a normal bloke won the Tour de FranceRead moreThe men’s Tour starts in Barcelona on 4 July with a rare team time trial over 19km and spends three days in north-east Spain before crossing the Pyrenees into France, with a first climbing finish to Les Angles.The threat of pro-Palestinian protests, which overshadowed this year’sVuelta a Espanaandforced the cancellation of the final stage, during the Grand Départ in Catalunya in July appear to have receded, for now.There are a number of familiar stage towns – Pau, Bordeaux, Bergerac, Chambéry, Gap and Paris – and some innovations, including a mountain finish, deep in the Pyrenees, to Gavarnie-Gèdre, and a first visit to the fearsome climb of Plateau de Solaison.On a route with more than 54,000m of vertical gain, there is no doubt that the showcase finale on Alpe d’Huez, which will host the finishes to stages 19 and 20, will be the key moment of the race.The penultimate stage, 24 hours before the peloton arrives in Paris for a reprise of this year’s circuit around Montmartre, has a monstrous 5,600m elevation gain and takes in the climbs of the Croix de Fer, Télégraphe and Galibier, before the second haul to the Alpe, via the rugged and steep Col de Sarenne.As the men’s race focuses on Alpe d’Huez, theTour de FranceFemmes makes another big step in prestige, by moving to a new slot in the calendar, a week after the men’s race ends, and breaking new ground with a firstvisit to Mont Ventoux.The new stand-alone date for the Femmes reveals how quickly the race has established itself and how popular it has become, particularly after the win of France’s Pauline Ferrand-Prévot this summer.“We no longer need men for the Tour de France Femmes to exist,” said the race director, Marion Rousse. “There’s no need to have the men’s race as a platform to launch the women’s race.

On a previously dry day, the weather teased and taunted. Rain first intervened at 7.17pm, two minutes after the start of play. After a brief resumption it returned, paused, gave the ground staff a bit of time to mop up, allowed the umpires to schedule a 10pm restart and then fell once again at 9.59pm. Twenty-five balls were bowled.“You don’t want to come all the way over to this part of the world and only play one game,” Harry Brook said. “Very frustrating.”New Zealand v England: final men’s T20 abandoned – as it didn’t happenRead moreFor the record, England won the toss and chose to bowl. Two of the first three deliveries went for four, both hit by Tim Seifert – a tantalising glimpse of the kind of run-scoring a combination of a placid wicket, a wild wind and Eden Park’s diminutive boundaries might have produced.Two of the last three deliveries went for six, Rachin Ravindra and Seifert pulling into the stands. New Zealand stood at 38 for one, off 3.4 overs, when the game officially ended.For all his frustration, Brook at least has three ODIs to come, but three members of this England squad will no longer be involved once the action moves to Mount Maunganui on Sunday. Zak Crawley (no balls faced) will stay in New Zealand to continue his Ashes preparations while Phil Salt (60 balls faced) and Jordan Cox (18) head home.Friday marks the first anniversary of Cox being ruled out of England’s Test series here with a broken thumb sustained in training. He must be wishing his luck in this country would be as unpredictable as the weather.This was the first time an international had been attempted in Auckland in October and neatly illustrated why. “I guess this time of year rain is always a potential,” said Mitchell Santner, the New Zealand captain. “It’s always nice to play England no matter what time of year you play.” The issue being that they spent most of the time they were supposed to be playing England not playing England.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Rise of Katie Lam reflects rightward shift on migrationRead more“‘Go home’ is a chant used by people who are bigoted or racist – so we have to be very careful when using phrases like ‘go home’, when talking in particular about legal migration. Politicians, especially ones who aspire to be in leadership frontline roles, should use language that is appropriate.”A senior Tory said: “All this time Lam has been seen as number two to Robert Jenrick. That seems to have shifted post-conference where it looks like she’s now trying to take his spot on the hard right of the party. In trying to do so she has upset a lot of colleagues.“This is what happens when you are new to the party and don’t really understand what it is about. There is a line but she has gone so far past it, it is just a dot to her.”Keir Starmer vehemently condemned Lam’s comments on Thursday, saying: “I can’t tell you how much I disagree with her.”He told ITV: “I think that her approach, where people who are lawfully in this country, who have been working in our communities, perhaps in our schools, in our hospitals, running businesses – our neighbours, people lawfully here – she wants to reach in and remove them from our country, for cultural reasons she says. That is how far the Conservative party has sunk.”Lam has been tipped as a future Tory leader and is seen by colleagues as a close ally of Jenrick, the shadow justice secretary, and Nick Timothy, a Tory MP and former special adviser.A number of Conservative MPs have privately criticised Lam’s remarks and the matter has been raised with party whips. A party spokesperson declined to comment.Kemi Badenoch’s spokesperson said on Wednesday that Lam’s comments were“broadly in line” with party policy, which was interpreted by some as an endorsement and others as a gentle rebuke.It is understood that Lam’s comments prompted concern within Badenoch’s office about “freelancing” by a very junior shadow minister.TheConservativeshave set out plans to retrospectively strip the right of indefinite leave to remain (ILR) from people who claim benefits, which could result in many being deported.There was continued confusion on Thursday about the policy, with officials providing no details on several important points and a senior shadow cabinet minister describing it inaccurately.James Cleverly, the shadow housing secretary, denied that the proposal involved removing ILR in the UK from people already granted it. “Retrospective changes are not what we are talking about as our policy,” he told Times Radio.However, this contradicts the party’s plans on ILR as set outin a draft billfrom the shadow home secretary, Chris Philp. In a section titled “Revocation of indefinite leave to remain in certain circumstances”, it says ILR should be removed if people commit a crime, claim any kind of benefits or earn less than £38,700 for six months or longer.There is also speculation about whether Badenoch was fully aware of her party’s proposals on ILR before the furore caused by Lam’s interview.It remains unclear how the policy would work, including whether families might be split up, for example if someone with children and a spouse who has UK nationality might be stripped of their right to be in the country.While Tory officials say people would not lose their ILR for claiming the state pension, it is not known whether they could if they received maternity or shared parental pay.After Badenoch’s spokesperson was unable to provide clarity at a briefing on Wednesday, there was no response to questions put to the Conservative party or to Philp.Max Wilkinson, the Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesperson, said the Conservatives were “trying to deport people who came to the UK legally and have lived, worked and paid their taxes in the UK for years”.He said: “People who played by the rules – many of which were created by the Conservatives themselves – do not need to ‘go home’. This is their home.”Explore more on these topicsConservativesImmigration and asylumnewsShareReuse this content"

He finally her told her the truth in 2018.On one occasion, in 2015, he had sex with her. This occurred a year after the spycops inquiry had beencommissioned by the UK governmentto scrutinise allegations of misconduct by undercover officers who infiltrated political movements.One of the key issues in front of the inquiry is how for decades the undercover officers haveregularly formed sexual relationshipswith women without disclosing that they had adopted fake personas and had been sent to spy on political activists.Thomson, who infiltrated animal rights campaigners between 1997 and 2002, is set to be questioned next month by the inquiry, which has said there were “very many troubling aspects” to his deployment.Earlier this month, David Barr, the inquiry’s chief barrister, said Thomson “has, on his own admission, told many lies to date. He has lied not only to those he mixed with while deployed but also to his managers and to the inquiry.”Among the allegations he will face are that he fabricated claims that an animal rights activist was seeking a gun to take revenge on a political opponent, developed a second fake identity without the authorisation of his Metropolitan police superiors, and broke the law while obtaining multiple identity documents.Thomson was forced to admit to the inquiry that he had deceived two women into sexual relationships while undercover after initially denying this.Ellie described how Thomson washer first real love and serious boyfriend. She was a “a particularly young and naive 21-year-old” when she started the relationship in 2001. He told her he was 33 when he was actually 36.She was “devastated and really heartbroken” when he said he needed to move to America in 2002 to be near his children and his ex-partner. This was a ruse as he was actually ending his undercover deployment.Afterwards, Ellie and Thomson stayed in regular touch for more than a decade as they maintained relations that were “intimate, loving and romantic in nature … there was always sexual attraction and intimacy in our interactions … every time we met it was like being on a date,” she said.“In hindsight all of these ongoing interactions meant it was very difficult to ever get over him and move on. He has been the one that ‘got away’, if you will, and no one has compared.”She said she had still not been able to fully process his deception and had been left with a “deep mistrust of those who I previously believed were there to protect society as a whole”.“I despise being some sort of victim. I hate that I was gullible and so naive, but seeing what the Metropolitan police are like nowadays, I am no longer surprised that they never even considered we were worth basic respect. I hate the amount of tears I have shed over this as it makes me feel pathetic,” she said.In 2005, Ellie moved to Australia with her friend, an animal rights activist known as Wendy, who also testified on Thursday that Thomson had deceived her. She had been friends with him for 21 years without him disclosing his real identity. “The depth of the intrusion into every aspect of my life is unbelievable,”she said.Last week a woman who was deceived by Thomson into a year-long intimate relationship testified. The woman,known as Sara, described how she fell in love with him after meeting him in 1998, believing him to beher soulmate, and would have married him if he had asked.Explore more on these topicsPoliceSpycops scandalnewsShareReuse this content"

It is thought that 2% of the British population applied for tickets.And on Wednesday, Lady Taylor of Stevenage said: “Next July, I will have the benefit of five days of Oasis concerts in the fantastic venue of Knebworth House, which is just about a mile away from my house.”‘We were drunk all the time!’: how Oasis got mad for it – in picturesRead moreThe Labour peer added: “I can hear and enjoy [the gigs] from my house, and they represent the important cultural role of music venues and … make an enormous contribution to our economy.”Yet hours after sthat statement, she rowed back on what she had said in the chamber.She told the Guardian: “I was speaking hypothetically following speculation that they would play Knebworth again as they did in August 1996. I understand the band have not confirmed this.”The peer said she had been comparing the proposed event with the local festival Old Town Live, during a discussion about the decline of music venues and the fact new bands were finding it harder to move from local gigs to the stadium concerts Oasis are now playing.Representatives of Oasis declined to comment, but the Guardian understands the band’s management is unaware of the suggested five-night stand.Some people have been holding out hope that the concerts could happen. The current occupant of the property, Henry Lytton-Cobbold, invited the band to play an anniversary gig in 2024.“Wembley is a reasonable warmup venue for Knebworth,” he joked after thereunion gigs were announced. “Then get ready for a nice huge 30th shindig in 2026.”When approached by the Guardian after Oasis’s press team had poured cold water on the gigs, Lytton-Cobbold encouraged the band to get in touch.He said: “Clearly it’s what the people want, clearly it should happen – but let’s get it in the diary, as our summer 2026 weekends are swiftly filling up.”The dates would be another huge cultural moment for the band, who dominated the summer of 2025 with a reunion tour that included sellout dates at Wembley.The UK’s summer of Oasis is over – but the unity and euphoria it created is unforgettable | Emma GarlandRead moreOasis are now in South Asia for a leg of their world tour, which includes gigs in South Korea and Japan. Their concerts this year are the first time Liam andNoel Gallagherhave performed together since 2009.The band played Knebworth in 1996 a year after the release of their second album, (What’s the Story) Morning Glory?, which went in at No 1, with the gig seen as the crowning moment in their career.The two gigs, alongside the Maine Road concerts, also in 1996, have become a key part of Oasis lore. They have inspireddocumentaries, and Liam Gallagher returned to the stately home in 2022for a solo gig.While that performance earned mixed reviews, the reunion tour has been seen as one of the most successful – andlucrative– returns in British music history.Taylor, the former leader of Stevenage borough council, which neighbours Knebworth in rural Hertfordshire, made the comments in response to the Tory peer Lady McIntosh of Pickering’s concerns that planning legislation threatened the small venues that Oasis and others played on their rise to stadium tours.“Of the 34 venues Oasis played to launch their careers, only 11 remain. The figures speak for themselves,” McIntosh said.Ticket sales for new Knebworth shows would be highly scrutinised after the “dynamic pricing” employed when fans tried to buy tickets for the original run of reunion gigs, with tickets originally priced at £148.50, rebranded as “in demand” and soaring to £355.20.For now the gigs are just rumours, albeit ones started in the upper house – but Oasis fans might want to start checking Hansard, rather than social media, for the next big announcement from their favourite band.Explore more on these topicsOasisHertfordshireEnglandLiam GallagherNoel GallagherHouse of LordsnewsShareReuse this content"

However, some experts have arguedthe dinosaurs were already in decline.Now researchers say the dating of a rock formation inNew Mexicothrows doubt on that idea, suggesting dinosaurs were thriving until the fateful impact.Dr Andrew Flynn, the first author of the research at New Mexico State University, said: “I think based on our new study that shows that, at least in North America, they weren’t going towards extinction.”Writing in the journal Science, Flynn and colleagues report how they dated a unit of rock called the Naashoibito Member in the San Juan basin using two methods.The first involved analysing the ratio of two argon isotopes within crystals found in the rock, providing a maximum age for its formation. The second involved analysing the alignment of magnetic particles within material forming the rock – a feature that reflects the direction of Earth’s magnetic field at the time it was laid down.Flynn said: “The extinction event actually happens essentially directly in the middle of a fairly short period of polarity [where Earth’s magnetic poles are] reversed.”Taken together, the results suggest the section of the Naashoibito Member where the youngest dinosaur fossils have been found was formed, at most, about 350,000 years before the mass extinction. “These are the very last dinosaurs in southern North America,” Flynn said.The team says the results suggest dinosaurs of that period were more diverse than previously thought. “There isn’t some uniform North American dinosaur fauna that made them really prone to extinction,” Flynn said.Indeed, while there were some species common to the north and south of North America, including big predators such as T rex, there were also marked differences – something the researchers suggest reflects variations in climate.Prof Steve Brusatte, a co-author of the study at the University of Edinburgh, said: “In the north there were lots of horned triceratops and standard duck-billed dinosaurs like edmontosaurus. But in the south there were duck-bills with elaborate crests and, most striking of all, there were enormous long-necked sauropods.”He noted that one sauropod, alamosaurus, was almost 30 metres (100ft) long and weighed more than a Boeing 737.“There is no sign that these dinosaurs were in any trouble, or that anything unusual was happening to them, or that they were in any type of long-term decline,” Brusatte said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst ThingFree daily newsletterOur US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The palaeontologist, who was not involved in the work, said: “The new evidence about these very late-surviving dinosaurs in New Mexico is very exciting, and shows in one locality at least that the faunas were diverse.”But Benton noted the paper looked at only one location, not a representation of the complexity of dinosaur species at the time across North America, or all over the world.“As the authors also show in the paper, in general dinosaurs of the last 6m years of the Cretaceous were less diverse, falling from 43 species beforehand to 30 species in western North America,” he said.“We would suggest that there is evidence for overall declines in dinosaurs towards the end of the Cretaceous, with individual rich faunas where climates were favourable.”Explore more on these topicsDinosaursEvolutionBiologyFossilsZoologyNew MexiconewsShareReuse this content"

The civil court in Paris ordered the company to remove messages from its website that said it wanted to reach carbon neutrality by 2050 and be a big player in the energy transition.The case, brought by NGOs including Greenpeace France and Friends of the Earth France, is the first time the country’s “greenwashing” laws have been applied to a fossil fuel company. Courts in theNetherlandsand Germany have already found that airlines misled consumers with vague environmental claims.The French court gave TotalEnergies a month to take down the misleading statements or face a fine of €10,000 (£8,700) a day. It was also ordered to post the court’s ruling on its website, with the same penalty for noncompliance, as well as to pay €8,000 to each of the three NGOs and €15,000 for their legal costs.“The French justice system is finally tackling the impunity of fossil fuel greenwashing that Total has enjoyed until now,” said Justine Ripoll, campaigns manager at Notre Affaire à Tous, one of the NGOs that brought the case. “It sends a clear message: climate disinformation is not an acceptable business strategy.”TotalEnergies said it acknowledged the court’s judgment and added that most of the claims against it were dismissed. The company, which has an installed renewable capacity of 35GW and is aiming for 100GW by 2030, said the judgment does not target any of TotalEnergies Electricité et Gaz France’s advertising campaigns concerning offers to consumers inFrance, but only targets general statements on the website of the parent company, TotalEnergies SE.The company, which aims to achieve 100 gigawatts of renewable power generation by 2030 but has made fossil gas a “cornerstone” of its strategy, has said it was a multi-energy company aiming to “responsibly, cost-effectively and sustainably produce the energy that we all need in our daily lives”.The ruling is the result of a legal action brought by NGOs in 2022 in response to a campaign when the company changed its name from Total.The court ordered TotalEnergies to remove statements that said it placed sustainable development at the heart of its strategy and that it “contributed to the wellbeing of populations” in line with the UN’s sustainable development goals.Judges dismissed a further accusation of greenwashing over the company’s claims about fossil gas and biofuels. The court found that although the statements contained some disputed claims, they were for informational rather than commercial purposes.Climate activists and green groups have increasingly taken fossil fuel companies to court for environmental claims that do not align with published climate science.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Meanwhile, the International Energy Agency found that “no new oil and gas” exploration was compatible with its key scenario for keeping planetary heating to that level.Jonathan White, a lawyer for ClientEarth, which supported the NGOs, said TotalEnergies appeared to be continuing with oil and gas projects despite warnings from climate experts.“This landmark judgment sends a clear warning shot to other oil and gas majors in Europe and beyond,” he said. “Claiming to be part of the transition while backing new fossil fuel projects comes at a tried-and-tested legal price.”Explore more on these topicsEnvironmentClimate crisisFranceOil and gas companiesFossil fuel divestmentEnergy industrynewsShareReuse this content"

In one case, the fang of a blunt-nosed viper (Macrovipera lebetina) snapped and went flying. “That was quite dramatic, obviously,” Evans said.“This is likely how fang loss during feeding most often occurs, but this is the first time it has been caught on camera,” the researchers noted in the paper.“Fangs have previously been found in snake scats, which means fangs often break off during prey penetration, remain stuck in the prey and are swallowed by the snake.”View image in fullscreenWounds in the gel target from a colubrid snake using its rear fangs to slice.Photograph: Silke CleurenThe loss of individual fangs was not a problem, Evans said. “They’re replaced – the snakes make new fangs throughout their life.”Evans said the findings on how different snake species strike would add to “information about their conservation and protection”.“Only by knowing their diet and hunting methods can we be confident in that we’re going to put forward protection schemes that are going to be successful.”The study’s lead author, Dr Silke Cleuren, who is also of Monash University, tested the snakes at Venomworld, a venom production institution on the outskirts of Paris.Dr Alessandro Palci of Flinders University, who was not involved in the study, said the research “fills gaps in our knowledge of snakes’ striking behaviour”.“The differences in behaviour that have been reported for viperids, elapids, and colubrids correlate well with what we know about their fang anatomy,” he said.Explore more on these topicsSnakesWildlifeReptilesAnimalsAnimal behaviournewsShareReuse this content"

It did so despite having been responsible for 62,085 sewage spills, averaging seven hours each, in 2024.StrugglingThames Waterwas the only company to be awarded one star for its performance. In 2023-24, its serious sewage pollution incidents more than doubled from 14 to 33.Thames is on the brink of collapseas the company struggles to secure a deal to write off its debt and secure its future. It has been battling huge debts built up over two decades by owners who have been criticised for paying out dividends without investing enough in its leaking pipes and malfunctioning treatment works.The report blames the lower performance onwet and stormy weather in 2024; underinvestment in, and poor maintenance of, infrastructure; as well as increased monitoring and inspection.Ofwat’s performance report was also published on Thursday and the regulator found pollution incidents remained at unacceptable levels, with only two companies having reported a reduction in incidents over the five-year period.It found that so far during the 2020-25 period, water companies had increased the amount of sewage spilled despite having promised to cut it by 30%.The report says: “Companies achieved a reduction of 15% in the first three years, but the increase in the final two years has led to an overall 27% increase in numbers across the 2020-25 period.”The Environment Agency’s ratings have been criticised as not fit for purpose by pollution experts because they allow top marks to be awarded to companies that illegally spill sewage.Bosses of companies found to“recklessly” dischargesewage have been able to justify theirlarge pay packetsbecause of being awarded the top rating, while companies responsible for sewage spills can call themselves “industry leaders”.The Environment Agency will introduce new ratings in 2027, replacing the star system with descriptors and numbers.At present, companies are given one to four stars. As part of the new methodology, they will instead be given a numeric rating from one to five, with only those that achieve the highest standards across the board rated “excellent” and the worst performers rated as “failing”.The Environment Agency chair, Alan Lovell, said: “This year’s results are poor and must serve as a clear and urgent signal for change. What is needed now from every water company is bold leadership, a shift in mindset and a relentless focus on delivery. We will support them however we can but will continue to robustly challenge them when they fall short.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

If they score highly on some of these, they can get top marks even if they have discharged large amounts of untreated waste into rivers and seas.Severn Trent hasused the company’s four-star ratingto justify the pay packet and bonus of its chief executive. Last year, Liv Garfield was awarded a £3.2m pay deal, including a £584,000 bonus, despite the company being fined £2m for spilling 260m litres of sewage into the River Trent.This week the chancellor,Rachel Reeves, told regulators to focus on helping businesses achieve economic growth rather than enforcing regulations.She announced that the government would set growth targets and publish a league table. It also plans to overhaul regulation by abolishing Ofwat and creating a “super regulator” by merging the powers of the existing bodies.Campaigners have questioned how effective this will be, as the privatised water system has allowed large bonuses and dividends to be paid by companies at the expense of investment in sewage infrastructure.James Wallace, CEO of River Action, said: “We urgently need a complete overhaul of this failed system to ensure that bill payers receive a fair service and that our rivers are properly protected from pollution. For years we have been promised change, but nothing has changed.“It is time for the failed privatisation experiment to end, starting with putting ThamesWaterinto special administration. England’s water companies must be owned and run for the public good, not private profit, and must deliver clean water, healthy rivers, and reliable service.”Explore more on these topicsWater industryWaterPollutionRegulatorsEnvironment AgencyUtilitiesThames WaternewsShareReuse this content"

It leaves us susceptible to huge price spikes during times of conflict – as we saw when Russia invaded Ukraine.”They added: “To help unlock the investments needed to achieve energy sovereignty, and ensure we stop handing over billions of dollars a year to the Kremlin, we urge you to push for spending on renewable and low-carbon energy to be counted as part of theNato1.5% target.”Retired Lt Gen Richard Nugee, one of the signatories of the letter, told the Guardian that investing in renewable energy was more secure than seeking more gas supplies, as some have urged, because wind turbines, solar panels and other forms of renewable energy are more dispersed and thus less vulnerable to attack.“To have a strong military deterrence, we need a resilient homeland,” he said. “If we want to build a resilient country, low-carbon energy is a very important component.”V Adm Ben Bekkering, a former senior Royal Netherlands Navy officer and currently partner of the InternationalMilitaryCouncil on Climate and Security, said governments must take a broader view of threats. “We need to find ways to look at security from a wider perspective than just the military,” he said. “By finding ways to increase our military, economic and ecological sustainability, we stand a chance [against aggression].”The other signatories include: Tom Middendorp, former chief of defence of the Netherlands; Air Marshal Sir Graham Stacey, former chief of staff of Nato Allied Command Transformation; R Adm Neil Morisetti, former senior Royal Navy officer and now professor of climate and resource security at University College London; retired Brig John Deverell, former UK director of defence diplomacy; and retired Lt Gen Richard Wardlaw, chair of the Centre for Economic Security and former chief of defence logistics in the UK Strategic Command.There is growingawareness among senior military figures of the potential impacts of the climate crisis, but it is not clear whetherheads of government are prioritising the issue. Downing Street earlier this monthsuppressed publication of a major report by the Joint Intelligence Committeethat warned the UK would be at risk if large ecosystems overseas, such as the Amazon, were to collapse.Many countries are cutting back spending on overseas aid, including helping poorer countries afflicted by the climate crisis, even while expanding their defence budgets. But several senior experts have said thatgovernments should consider putting more money into overseas climate finance, in their own interests, and that they should finance this from their national security budgets.Gareth Redmond-King, head of the international programme at theEnergyand Climate Intelligence Unit thinktank, said: “Clean energy is the route to net zero – the only solution we have to halting climate change and avoiding ever worsening impacts. And clean energy offers greater national security, if we want to end our reliance on authoritarian states that control so much of the world’s fossil fuels, at least one of whose wars have driven up household energy prices so much in recent years.”A UK government spokesperson said: “We have made a historic commitment to spend 5% of GDP on national security. This includes spending 3.5% on our military and 1.5% building our country’s resilience to threats. By delivering our clean energy superpower mission we are getting the UK off the rollercoaster of fossil fuel prices and on to clean, homegrown power – protecting consumers, creating jobs and tackling the climate crisis.”Explore more on these topicsRenewable energyMilitaryNatoEnergyDefence policynewsShareReuse this content"

The evidence presented by the crown falls well short of this standard and signally fails to reach the high standard of proof required in a criminal case; that of proof beyond a reasonable doubt. Therefore, I find the accused not guilty on all seven counts on the present bill of indictment.”The verdict prompted polarised reactions outside the court, where families of the dead men said justice had been denied but supporters of the former paratrooper hailed the end of what they called a witch-hunt.It was a dramatic climax to a five-week trial closely watched by nationalists, army veteran groups and the British and Irish governments. The judge presided without a jury, which is permitted in exceptional cases.Soldier F, a former lance corporal, had pleaded not guilty to the murders of James Wray, 26, and William McKinney, 22, and the attempted murder of five others. Granted anonymity by a court order, he was concealed in the dock by a curtain.A formal inquiry soon after the killings cleared the troops of wrongdoing but a 2010 inquiry found they shot people who posed no threat and then lied in a cover-up that lasted decades, a finding that prompted anapologyfrom the then prime minister, David Cameron.Delivering his verdict, the judge said paratroopers had “lost all sense of military discipline” and shot unarmed civilians fleeing from them. “Those responsible should hang their heads in shame,” he said.But the trial hinged not on “collective guilt” but individual guilt, and the main evidence against Soldier F came from two fellow paratroopers, Soldiers G and H, whose decades-old testimony was unreliable, he said.“Their statements, the sole and decisive evidence, cannot be tested in a way that witnesses giving evidence from the witness box would be. Delay has, in my view, seriously hampered the capacity of the defence to test the veracity and accuracy of the hearsay statements.” The judge found that Soldiers G and H had been “serially untruthful”.Speaking outside court, Mickey McKinney, the brother of William McKinney, said the families did not blame the trial judge for the ruling but a British state complicit in murder and cover-up.Families were proud of theirlong campaignfor truth and justice, he said. “Soldier F has been discharged from the defendant’s criminal dock, but it is one million miles away from being an honourable discharge.”Michelle O’Neill, Northern Ireland’s first minister and vice-president of Sinn Féin, called the verdict deeply disappointing.“Fifty-three years ago, the British army indiscriminately murdered civilians on the streets of Derry. Over 15 years ago, the then British prime minister publicly acknowledged the role of British soldiers onBloody Sunday. Yet not one British soldier or their military and political superiors has ever been held to account. That is an affront to justice.”There were tense scenes outside court as some supporters of families heckled those backing Soldier F.Paul Young, a spokesperson for the Northern Ireland Veterans Movement, said the verdict would hearten veterans. “Soldiers across the United Kingdom will be happy with this, and I hope that there is no more soldiers brought to the courts here with evidence that has actually no way of going through.”The Democratic Unionist party leader, Gavin Robinson, said most troops who served during the Troubles did so with “honour”.A British government spokesperson said it had noted the judgment and added: “We are committed to finding a way forward that acknowledges the past, whilst supporting those who served their country during an incredibly difficult period in Northern Ireland’s history.”Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

She said the supermarket declined to give him a paid job despite him offering more than 600 hours to the store “purely because he wanted to belong, contribute, and make a difference”, and that he was a well-liked member of the team by his co-workers.Boyd added that they had only asked for a few hours of paid work “not as charity, but as recognition for all the time, effort, and heart” Tom had given to the store, and that she and her family were “shocked by how dismissive and cold” the management’s response was, and that Tom was asked not to return.The post also claimed that Waitrose had not made any reasonable adjustments for Tom, who has limited communication skills, despite it being mandated by theEquality Act 2010, and that he received “no apology, no thanks, and no recognition for his commitment. Just silence.”The post led to an outpouring of support for Tom, with Boyd telling the BBC on Thursday that she had been “overwhelmed” by people’s responses and that her son had been offered a job by another supermarket.“We’ve had some great news –Asdahave offered him two five-hour paid shifts a week,” Boyd said. “It’s overwhelming and they are flexible to say if at any time he is struggling they are fine. How amazing that a company could do this.”As well as support, Boyd’s Facebook post also led to intense criticism being directed towards Waitrose for its handling of the situation, with some customers claiming on social media that they would no longer visit the store.The mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham, decried the company’s “truly terrible” treatment of Tom in a post on X.After the backlash, Waitrose offered Boyd his job back in a paid capacity, but it is understood this offer was declined.Burnham also pledged to support Boyd and others like him, saying that the Greater Manchester Combined Authority “would encourage all employers, including Waitrose, to sign up to our brand new Bee Neuroinclusive code of practice”, a guide for how companies should support neurodivergent employees. He offered Boyd’s mother the chance to be an ambassador for campaign, which she accepted.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Of those 20% however, 60% will have to be available at the cheapest social rents.The plans, which wererevealed last weekby the Guardian, come after new housebuilding in Londonshrank tojust a few thousand units a year, with developers saying they are constrained by high interest rates and sluggish planning procedures.They have caused anger among homelessness campaigners and some Labour MPs, however, who say the government is undermining its pledge to tackle homelessness.Reed said in a statement: “Getting spades in the ground in London is crucial if we want to see the biggest increase in social and affordable housing and meet our target of delivering 1.5m homes.“I have worked closely with the mayor of London to give the capital the shot-in-the-arm it needs to ensure more Londoners have an affordable home of their own.”Sadiq Khan, the London mayor, said: “There is now a perfect storm facing housebuilding in London due to a combination of high interest rates, the rising cost of construction materials, the impact of the pandemic and ongoing consequences of Brexit.“All of this means we are now in the midst of the most difficult period for housebuilding since the global financial crash. Urgent action is required, which is why I’ve been working with the government on this package of bold measures.”Under the plan, developers will be allowed to qualify for fast-track status with a reduced number of affordable homes. If, however, the company fails to build quickly enough they will be made to hand over some of their profits to the local council to build additional affordable units.Housebuilders will also be given relief from the local tax which is designed to help pay for local infrastructure such as roads and GP surgeries. And they will be allowed to reduce the number of bicycle storage spaces per unit, in a move officials said reflected the increased use of dockless bikes.The package, which is set to expire on 31 March 2028, is designed to kickstart building after a sudden decline in recent months. A recent report by the consultancy Molior showed builders started work on just 3,248 private sector homes in the first three months of this year.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

That figure was more than four times higher in the subsequent seven years, at 8,460.Matt Downie, the chief executive of Crisis, said: “The government has said they want to end the moral stain of homelessness. We back them to the hilt in that ambition – but we have real concerns that the solution they are presenting here doesn’t come close to addressing the scale of the problem.“Over the years we’ve seen how fiddling with targets and putting faith in market forces leads to nowhere near enough social rent homes being built. The stark and shameful truth of this is record levels of homelessness.”Explore more on these topicsHousingCommunitiesLondonEnglandHousing marketReal estateSteve ReednewsShareReuse this content"

Sources at the watchdog, however, have briefed that it is broadly similar to interim advice issued shortly after April’slandmark supreme court rulingthat sex in the Equality Act refers only to biological sex.The interim advice, whichwas withdrawnlast week, said the supreme court ruling meant transgender people should not be allowed to use toilets meant for the gender they live as, and that in some cases they could not use toilets consistent with their birth sex.Transgender groups and some MPs expressed alarm at the advice, saying it would in effect exclude trans people from much of the public realm. The Council of Europe’s commissioner for human rights subsequently wrote to UK MPs cautioning against the possible “widespread exclusion of trans people”.The letter to Kyle, signed by nearly 50 Labour backbenchers and seen by the Guardian, said businesses around the country had expressed “concern about the potential impact on service delivery and cost implications of the code of practice if it mirrors the approach set out in the EHRC’s draft code”, and that the business community did not think the EHRC had taken these worries seriously.One particular concern, the letter said, was the “legal and compliance minefield” facing businesses if the EHRC guidance were to mean it was up to them to balance the rights of transgender people and the need to ensure women-only spaces under the terms of the supreme court ruling.“Businesses have told us that while, up until now, they have been used to resolving issues quickly and quietly, in line with corporate codes of conduct about values of tolerance and respect, and with a commonsense approach, they believe that, if the draft code becomes an official code of practice, they will find disputes frequently escalating into expensive court action,” the MPs wrote.Businesses were also concerned, the letter said, about the potential need to create new gender-neutral toilets and changing facilities, with one retailer saying doing this for its 200 stores would cost about £1.2m.It said there was also alarm about how staff would be expected to apply the new guidance, particularly the prospect of being forced to ask people to identify their gender, or say whether they were transgender, before they used single-sex facilities.“We do not believe the Equality and Human Rights Commission has provided satisfactory responses to questions around how they expect businesses to implement such stringent expectations,” the letter said.Among specific worries, it cited “the personal discomfort of staff in being willing to police gender”, the “moral, legal, and practical quagmire of identifying the gender identity of an individual based solely on their looks” and the safety considerations for staff if customers were to challenge someone’s right to use a single-sex space.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

That is why we have written this letter, to make sure their voices are heard and so the government and the EHRC understands the potential impact of the code of practice.”Agovernment spokesperson said the EHRC had submitted its updated code to the equalities minister, Bridget Phillipson. “The government will consider the draft updated code and, if the minister approves it, lay it before parliament,” they said.Explore more on these topicsTransgenderEquality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC)UK supreme courtLabournewsShareReuse this content"

The reparation loan remains an option, but is less likely to be ready early next year as Ukraine had hoped.Earlier on Thursday Zelenskyy urged leaders to take this “great” decision to fund Ukraine’s defence as soon as possible.Putin says he will never bow to US but concedes sanctions may cause ‘some losses’Read more“Anyone who delays this decision is not only limiting our defence but also slowing down your own progress,” he told EU leaders, promising that Ukraine would spend a lot of money buying European weapons. “The time to act on Russian assets is now and I urge for your full support.”The European Commission hopes to use the assets at Euroclear as the basis for a €140bn (£122bn) loan to Ukraine, which would only be repaid once Russia paid compensation for the war.Officials believe they have found a way of making Russia pay for its war without confiscating the assets or breaching property rights.The Kremlin says the scheme is theft and has vowed to pursue any individual or country deemed to have taken Russian money.Leaders need the agreement of Belgium, which hosts €183bn of Russian central bank assets at Euroclear – 86% of all Russian state assets in the EU and two-thirds of the worldwide total.Belgium’s prime minister, Bart De Wever, said the biggest problem was how to guarantee that the cash was available immediately if something went wrong.Arriving at the summit earlier on Thursday, he threatened to oppose the plan without guarantees that the rest of the EU would cover the cost if Russia came looking for its money.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We want guarantees if the money has to be paid back that every member state will chip in. The consequences cannot only be for Belgium,” he said.EU leaders tried to meet his concerns with a promise of “burden sharing and coordination” with the G7, but it was not enough to secure an agreement.About one-third of Russian state assets are held outside the EU, including in Japan (€28bn), the UK (€27bn), Canada (€15bn) and the US (€4bn). While the UK and Canada are expected to make similar moves, EU officials are less hopeful about the US, which holds a small but symbolic amount of Russian state assets.The loan plan remains on the table, with many unanswered questions. It depends on EU unanimity to keep Russian assets frozen for a long time. Hungary’s Russia-friendly government has frequently delayed EU sanctions and, although it has never dared to block them, its anti-Ukraine rhetoric raises questions about its future support.Hungary’s prime minister, Viktor Orbán, skipped the discussions on Ukraine to attend events in Budapestcommemorating the 1956 Hungarian revolution, which was crushed by Soviet repression. As now customary, the EU adopted a statement of support for Ukraine – including future financing – without Hungary’s backing.Earlier in the day, the EU agreed its 19th package of sanctions against Russia,targeting liquefied natural gasfor the first time. The move came soon after the US imposed sanctions on Russia’s two largest oil companies, Rosneft and Lukoil, the first restrictive measures passed by the Trump administration.Latvia’s prime minister, Evika Siliņa, said an agreement on the loan would strengthen Zelenskyy in any peace talks with Putin. “I believe [Zelenskyy] will be much stronger to enter those negotiations if those negotiations take place,” she said.Ireland’s taoiseach, Micheál Martin, said his government supported the plan and did not see any implications for Irish neutrality.“This cannot be a repeating cycle where … big countries feel, like Russia, they can go in and destroy a place and expect other people to pay for the reconstruction afterwards,” he said.Zelenskyy expressed hope that the US would eventually supplylong-range Tomahawk missiles. “It was like sanctions: before it was unbelievable and now we see the decisions on these energy sanctions, which are very important,” he said.But he downplayed reports of a 12-point peace plan that emerged earlier this week, suggesting it was the work of “some very good friends” seeking to pre-empt “some plan from Russia” promoted by another country that he did not name.The plan, which was first reported by Bloomberg, called for a ceasefire, prisoner exchanges and the creation of a peace board chaired by Donald Trump – taking inspiration from the US administration’s Gaza plan.Zelenskyy said Russia showed no sign of wanting to stop the war, citing therecent bombing of a kindergarten. “More pressure on Russia and they will sit and speak and I think this is the plan,” he said.Explore more on these topicsUkraineVolodymyr ZelenskyyEuropean UnionEuropeRussianewsShareReuse this content"

The 26-year-old suspect has appeared in court but cannot be named.Ch Supt Michael McNulty said on Thursday that police plan to keep a continuous presence at the complex over the next week and that units with riot gear, dogs, horses and a water cannon are on standby.Four gardaí have been treated in hospital for injuries during clashes with crowds who hurled rocks, bottles and other missiles.Protesters have displayed Irish flags, chanted anti-immigration slogans and charged police lines with horse-drawn carts and scrambler bikes.A police helicopter was targeted with lasers. The taoiseach, Micheál Martin, has condemned what he called the “violent disorder” and “vile abuse” against police.Demonstrations against asylum seekers and refugees have become common inIrelandin recent years, with protesters accusing the arrivals of worsening a housing shortage and driving violent crime.

He was sentenced to four months in prison.Melania Trump’s meme coin architects accused of pump-and-dump fraud in lawsuitRead moreZhao, who is often referred to by his initials CZ, is one of the world’s richest people and biggest names in cryptocurrency. He built Binance into the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, although the company has been barred from operating in the US after his 2023 guilty plea.Trump’s pardon is an immense victory for Zhao and Binance after months of speculation and lobbying. It is also yet another sign of the Trump administration’s shift toward easing scrutiny on the crypto industry, at a time when Trump and his family are building their own multibillion-dollar crypto empire.“Incredible news of CZ’s pardon today. We thank President Trump for his leadership and for his commitment to make the US the crypto capital of the world,” a spokesperson for Binance said in a statement.Trump commented on the pardon during an exchange with the press on Thursday afternoon, downplaying Zhao’s crimes while claiming that he did not personally know the crypto mogul.“Are you talking about the crypto person? A lot of people say that he wasn’t guilty of anything,” Trump told a reporter who asked about the decision. “They say what he did was not even a crime. It wasn’t a crime. That he was persecuted by the Biden administration, and so I gave him a pardon at the request of a lot of very good people.”Representatives from Trump’s family crypto business have held talks with Binance about taking a stake in the US arm of the exchange, the Wall Street Journalreportedearlier this year. Zhao disputed that he was seeking to make a deal in exchange for a pardon.“Fact: I have had no discussions of a Binance US deal with … well, anyone,” Zhao claimed in a post on X in March. “No felon would mind a pardon,” he added.Binance has nevertheless played an important part in the growth of the Trump family’s World Liberty Financial crypto enterprise. When Binance accepted a $2bn transaction from an Emirati investment fund earlier this year, it agreed to have the funds be paid in a cryptocurrency developed by World Liberty Financial – a move that legitimized the Trump family’s digital currency and was highly lucrative for the firm.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

And I’m going to run for a fourth term inBrazil,” announced Lula, who celebrates his birthday on Monday.Even as he approaches 80, Lula remains by far the most influential figure on the Brazilian left – a status the former union leader has enjoyed for the last 40 years. If elected, he would be 85 by the time he finishes his fourth term and would have become the only democratically elected Brazilian president to have spent 16 years in power.Joe Biden’s disastrous 2024 re-election campaign, which the 81-year-old president was forced to abandon after an excruciating debate with Donald Trump, left some Brazilian voters fretting over the wisdom of an octogenarian Lula seeking another term.Brazil’s president says in UN speech that democracy can prevail over ‘would-be autocrats’Read moreBut Fernando Morais, Lula’s biographer and friend, insisted Brazil’s gym-going president was fit as a fiddle and sharp as a tack and hadn’t smoked a single cigarette since quitting after overcoming throat cancer nearly 15 years ago.“He’s not Joe Biden … I’ve never seen him suffer a memory lapse, neither in public nor in private when it’s just the two of us chatting … He’s someone who has astounding physical energy, not to mention the energy of his soul,” Morais said, showing off as proof a photograph of Lula taking a swipe at a punchbag with his red boxing gloves.The Brazilian writer, who travelled around the world with Lula while researching his biography, recalled how the pair once spent 23 hours flying back to Brazil from India, with a layover in Mozambique. “When we landed … I was a total wreck – a corpse – and I said: ‘OK, President, let’s go home and get some kip,’” Morais said. “But he said: ‘No, I’m off to Taubaté [a city in São Paulo] because I’ve got a rally to do there to help one of our candidates.’”“It’s unbelievable,” Morais added. “He’s one of those people who hardly needs to sleep. Four or five hours and he’s fine.”Lula first ran for elected office in 1982 and launched his first (unsuccessful) presidential campaign in 1989 before eventually winning power in 2002 and becoming his country’s first working-class president.The leftwing veteran appears well-placed to win next October’s election, with Brazil’s right currently in disarray after its most important leader, Bolsonaro, was sentenced to 27 years in prison for trying to stop Lula taking power with a military coup. Would-be successors are jostling to fill Bolsonaro’s shoes but polls suggest Lula would beat all of them.Lula’s hopes of claiming a fourth term have been boosted bya cack-handed campaign by the Trump administrationto help Bolsonaro avoid jail by hitting Brazil with 50% tariffs and sanctioning officials. That pressure failed to save Bolsonaro’s skin and gave Lula a bump in the polls.Trump recentlyextended an olive branch to the Brazilian president, saying he “seemed like a very nice man”, and the pair are expected to meet in Malaysia this weekend.Morais said he believed that if the 2026 election were held today, “Lula would win in the first round”.“I’m convinced his fourth term will be his best term of all and it will be the term that allows him to enter history through the front door,” he said.Not everyone is so convinced the 2026 vote will be a cakewalk.Celso Rocha de Barros​, the author ofa recent bookabout Lula’s Workers’ party (PT), saw its leader as the slight favourite. “But the election is still completely open,” he added.Barros predicted a tight race against the most likely rightwing candidate, the São Paulo governor and former Bolsonaro minister Tarcísio de Freitas, who would probably receive “the wholesale support​ of the political and economic elites”.In a recent interview, Guilherme Boulos, a 43-year-old politician widely considered to be one of Lula’s most promising heirs, warned that the election would be a bitter fight between Lula and whoever inherited Bolsonaro’s votes. “In the last election Lula only beat Bolsonaro by 2m votes … [and] the country remains polarised. It will be a tough, difficult election. And I don’t doubt that the major internet platforms and big techs will act directly to favour the far-right candidate.“It’s going to be war,” added Boulos, whom Lula this week made a minister and gave orders to roam South America’s largest country to mobilise support.Explore more on these topicsLuiz Inácio Lula da SilvaBrazilAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

While the frauds can involve assets such as gold, wine, property, carbon credits and land, it is thought that fake cryptocurrency tops the list.The banking body UK Finance, which issued the data, said industry intelligence pointed to “an ongoing prevalence of scams related to cryptocurrencies and the promise of significant returns advertised on social media”.For the victims, it often starts by clicking on a (fake) social media advert or news alert or watching a deepfake video. This typically is a tip for a supposedly lucrative crypto investment, but is in fact a trick that leads to fraudsters impersonating a real business.Investors often hand over a relatively small sum at first – perhaps £250 – and, thanks to sophisticated tools used by the scammers, such as software that displays a seemingly live crypto trading screen, they think they are getting rich.Victims typically lose bigger sums trying to cash out, with their “winnings” always blocked by the need for another payment, which might be a broker’s fee or a tax bill.In March the Guardianreported on a crypto scamoperating from the former Soviet state of Georgia that tricked people in the UK out of £9m. Deepfake videos and fictional news reports featuring the likes of the money expert Martin Lewis were used to promote the fake investments.Some individuals, including people who work in finance, have beenconned out of hundreds of thousands of pounds.The UK Finance findings are likely to increase calls for cryptocurrency firms and trade bodies to play a bigger part in industry efforts to fight fraud through collaboration.On Wednesday, Stop Scams UK helda behind-closed-doors roundtablefor firms in the banking, telecoms and technology sectors, which was attended by the Bank of England governor, Andrew Bailey, and the fraud minister, Lord Hanson.It is understood that some attendees were keen for the cryptocurrency sector to participate in a continuing collaboration, with firms working together to share data and propose solutions.UK Finance is calling on the government’s forthcoming fraud strategy “to ensure all sectors are accountable in preventing fraud”.Another area where there was a “concerning” increase in fraud losses wasromance scams, where victims were tricked into believing they were in a relationship, with the total amount stolen up 35% on last year.There was a 27% increase in contactless card fraud in the first six months of 2025.Many experts believe that the true totals are much higher, as many scam victims do not report the crime, often because they feel embarrassed or ashamed.Responding to the data, the Payments Association, a trade body, said UKpolicymakers had “failed to address the main issue: blocking fraud at source, preventing crime from happening and mandating responsibility for social media”.Richard Daniels, director of fraud at the bank TSB, said these crimes were being driven and enabled by “vulnerabilities in other sectors – especially social media”. He added: “Phone companies and social media platforms must urgently act to cut scam content off at source.”Explore more on these topicsScamsCybercrimeConsumer affairsInvestmentsCryptocurrenciesCrimeAlternative investmentsnewsShareReuse this content"

Van production has also slumped by nearly 40% so far this year, after the closure by the Vauxhall owner Stellantis of its factory in Luton.“September’s performance comes as no surprise given the total loss of production at Britain’s biggest automotive employer after a cyber incident,” said Mike Hawes, the SMMT’s chief executive. “While the situation has improved, the sector remains under immense pressure.”Automotive industry bosses and workers had been talking for more than a year of a “low-volume crisis” afflicting the sector, even before the JLR hack. The global automotive industry is under pressure in part because of ahuge increase in competition from Chinaand the need to invest in upgrading factories to produce electric cars. At the same time, higher interest rates and inflation have dented consumer appetite for new cars.The JLR hack added to the industry’s woes. The Cyber Monitoring Centre, a non-profit group, this week estimated that it has been themost costly hack in British historybecause of its widespread effects on the UK supply chain. The group estimated costs to the UK economy of about £1.9bn.Jaguar Land Rover hack has cost UK economy £1.9bn, experts sayRead moreSuppliers have been able to restart work as JLR goes through the careful job of ramping up demand and avoiding further costly disruption. One manufacturing executive said the ramp-up has gone better than expected, thanks in part to planning done earlier by JLR in partnership with larger suppliers.The car industry is also bracing for further disruption if a Dutch governmenttakeover of the Chinese-owned chipmaker Nexperiaaffects supply. Germany’s car industry this week warned that “the situation could lead to considerable production restrictions in the near future”, after China retaliated bybanning exports of finished products.The sales slump has driven the UK industry into repeated – and unwanted – comparisons with the 1950s, when British citizens still faced rationing after the second world war and the UK market was dominated by the British Motor Corporation, formed from the merger of Austin and Morris.Explore more on these topicsAutomotive industryJaguar Land RovernewsShareReuse this content"

As a result, “sales are likely to remain subdued for the rest of the year”, with a risk that revenues in the fourth quarter could fall below management’s expectations.Guy Gittins, the chief executive who started his career at Foxtons in 2002 andreturned to lead the company three years ago, said: “Macroeconomic uncertainty and speculation surrounding the delayed autumn budget has resulted in a subdued sales market as some buyers adopt a ‘wait and see’ attitude to purchases.”The Foxtons share price fell as much as 11% in early trading but later settled at 4.5% down.The Treasury is considering whether to bring in a new property tax to replace stamp duty on owner-occupied homes worth more than £500,000,the Guardian reported in August. Buyers in England and Northern Ireland currently pay stamp duty on homes worth more than £125,000, while first-time buyers pay the tax on homes valued at more than £300,000.On Monday, Dan Tomlinson, exchequer secretary to the Treasury, said during parliamentary questions that stamp duty raised about £12bn a year, adding: “Any changes to taxes such as SDLT [stamp duty land tax] would therefore have to be carefully considered given the potential effect on public finances.”Foxtons’ sales revenues in the third quarter fell by 7% to £12.5m, while lettings revenues increased by 5% to £33.4m. Overall, the estate agent made revenues of £49m between July and September, up 3% from the year-earlier period. In the year so far, it has taken in £135.1m, up 7%.Gittins believes that there “remains significant pent-up demand in the London volume market and we believe market conditions will improve once there is better clarity following the budget”.The company, founded in 1981, said the more stable revenue stream from lettings was helping to offset weaker sales from properties changing hands. Gittins said lettings remained the central part of its growth strategy. Recent acquisitions in Reading and Watford were performing well, and he said there would be more lettings-focused acquisitions.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Photograph: Richard Gray/AlamyTen years on from the release of her rococo masterpiece, Divers, we count down the singer-songwriter-harpist’s most beautiful and devastating tracksByLaura SnapesThu 23 Oct 2025 11.15 EDTLast modified on Thu 23 Oct 2025 17.11 EDTShare20. Divers (2015)“And in an infinite regress / Tell me, why is the pain of birth / Lighter borne than the pain of death?”Joanna Newsomsings on the elegant, kaleidoscopic title track to 2015’s time-obsessed Divers, its nesting cascades of strings and piano echoing the album’s premise, that life contains death, which contains life, and on and on to ∞ …19. Sapokanikan (2015)Joanna Newsom: Sapokanikan – videoThe jaunty piano and sweetly rambling verses of Sapokanikan belie the profound depth of history hidden within Divers’ lead single, which contemplates the passing of time in the palimpsest of landscapes and paintings rich with secrets. The song peaks in a sort of ecstatic existential panic: “Look and despair,” Newsom sings once it settles.18. Peach, Plum, Pear (2004)Since 2006’s Ys, Newsom’s albums have been so conceptually staggering that her simpler debut can seem juvenile by proxy. But it’s still obvious why anyone who heard 2004’s The Milk-Eyed Mender fell in love. Here, as her rattling harpsichord drives an urgent, anxious account of attraction and rejection, the sweetness of her voice and accompanying spurts of a children’s choir make the hurt sting even more.17. You Will Not Take My Heart Alive (2015)View image in fullscreenPerforming in Berlin, 2015.Photograph: Stefan Hoederath/RedfernsNewsom’s narrator manically fights to defy mortality: “Beyond recall, you severed all strings / To everyone, and everything,” she sings amid shards of harp and distorted organ. The beauty of this song lies in the devastating way she repeats the title, crushed as if by the force of protecting her heart.16. Easy (2010)From the monumental triple album Have One on Me, there is slyness in the beauty of Easy, which drains the colour from its beatific scenes of domestic bliss, in bed and fairytale glades, to reveal the strain and indignity of loving someone who resists it. It shifts from gentle piano and strings to something more courtly – maybe the forced ritual of love – as Newsom gradually makes her pained indignation plain.15. Only Skin (2006)The futility of care also drives Only Skin, the 17-minute showstopper of Ys (clock the last letter of Only and the first of Skin), which billows with hope and desperation. Frankly, you could rank the top 20 moments in this song alone: Van Dyke Parks’ grave, pristine string arrangements as Newsom exclaims “being a woman!” at 7:38 pip it for me.14. Sawdust & Diamonds (2006)View image in fullscreenNewsom in 2008.Photograph: Linda Nylind/The GuardianYs’s (comparatively) simplest moment strips back Parks’ arrangements and puts its other collaborator, engineerSteve Albini, in the spotlight, making a virtue of his aptitude for capturing performance: just Newsom, her harp and a heart-stoppingly determined vocal performance that dives into fathomless loss and pain. Her repeated shrieks of “o, desire!” rip the fabric of the universe.13. Does Not Suffice (2010)On the coda to Easy, Newsom packs her silky, cashmere things “and everything that could remind you / Of how easy I was not”, and pictures her cold former lover enjoying his empty palace. With just Newsom and her fingers slipping around the piano, the tone is bittersweet but stunned (and echoes the refrain from In California). It appears to end on a valedictory “la la la” – until the final minute cracks into telling, stormy dissonance.12. Good Intentions Paving Co (2010)Parks didn’t return for Have One on Me, but the rollicking Good Intentions evokes the playful, questing Americana of his debut album, 1967’s Song Cycle. The beauty of Newsom’s lyrics, meanwhile, lies in the contrast between the struggle to make a relationship work and the simplicity of her own desire: “I only want for you to pull over and hold me / Till I can’t remember my own name” is an all-timer.11. In California (2010)Almost every song on Have One on Me is a mini suite unto itself, moving through patches of conversational delivery, ridiculously beautiful melodies and baroque arrangements. Often the best parts are when Newsom’s equanimity boils over and the arrangements become frenzied, fraught: the “cuckoo, cuckoo-koo” cries here are piercingly lonely.10. Cosmia (2006)View image in fullscreenAt the Barbican, London, in 2007.Photograph: Mick Hutson/RedfernsThe incomprehensibility of loss – not being able to prevent it, nor survive it – radiates through Ys’s closing track, a dedication to a friend who died while Newsom was touring her debut. Her harp and Parks’ arrangements swell and search, climaxing in her wrenching attempt to reconcile pain with the soul’s release: “And I miss your precious heart,” she howls, over and over.9. On a Good Day (2010)The shortest song in Newsom’s catalogue may be her most brutal. Widely interpreted as being about a lost pregnancy, as well as the end of a relationship, it features just her and her harp casting holy light on the most terrible of disappointments.8. Time, as a Symptom (2015)View image in fullscreenAt the Vanity Fair Oscar party, 2018.Photograph: Taylor Hill/FilmMagicAs much as loss beats through Newsom’s catalogue, so does her absolute belief in beauty, love, the point of it all. “Stand brave, life-liver / Bleeding out your days / In the river of time,” she instructs in the rapturous ending to Divers (though the album’s final word, “trans-”, links to its first, “sending”, escaping linearity and conclusions in a perfect, unending loop).7. Leaving the City (2015)Newsom may have one of the most finely detailed catalogues in popular music, although her work never feels airless. The incantatory attack of the chorus to Leaving the City is maybe the closest she has sounded to reckless abandon, breaking free from the calculated materialism and glory her lyrics indict.6. Anecdotes (2015)Newsom joins an army of birds (“hotdogging loon!”) in a war against the tyranny of time, craving a “temporal infidelity” and immortality that doesn’t depend on surrendering our “borrowed bones” come life’s end. She’s a stalwart, stirring commander in the first half, before it skews prismatic and awesome, as if high on the possibilities of life beyond earthly constraint.5. Emily (2006)View image in fullscreenNewsom in 2010.Photograph: Sarah Lee/The GuardianOne of the most symphonically beautiful songs in Newsom’s catalogue is a tribute to her astrophysicist sister and her metaphysical and corporeal guidance. In a catalogue that should already have received the Pulitzer prize, describing shallow water as “a mud-cloud, mica-spangled, like the sky’d been breathing on a mirror” is especially wondrous.4. Jackrabbits (2010)From Big Black’s noise to Joanna Newsom’s hush: 10 of Steve Albini’s greatest recordingsRead moreNewsom sings in a crushed murmur on Jackrabbits, as if not wanting to own up to her proposal that, in the wake of grievous loss, she and her estranged lover might give things another go. Hearing this poetic writer sing something as tangibly mundane and despondent as “I was tired of being drunk” hits extra hard.3. Monkey & Bear (2006)A fable about exploitation and the toll of performance, this is the best storytelling in Newsom’s catalogue, with a depth of reference to nature, the cosmos and the gods unmatched by anyone. The menace that comes into her voice as the monkey realises the bear is set to escape is startling, piqued by leaping woodwinds.2. Baby Birch (2010)The simple lilt of harp at the outset of Baby Birch echoes the childlike beauty of Newsom’s debut single, Sprout and the Bean, which only adds to the agony of another song that clearly concerns pregnancy loss. Six minutes in, the weather darkens and the pace quickens, creating an utterly gut-punching sense of futile panic.1. Go Long (2010)Touching on the story of Bluebeard and the chamber of murdered past brides that he reveals to his next victim – “gilded with the gold teeth of the women who loved you” – the exquisite Go Long excoriates the male pride, violence and stubbornness that condemns such figures to loneliness at the expense of those who try to love them. It’s one of Newsom’s finest-spun performances, her harp a reverberant synaptic tingle, her grave delivery flaring with contempt and pity. Of all her admonitions, about war and regal hauteur, the sorriness in her voice as she observes “you are badly hurt, you’re a silly goose” may be the most cutting of all.Joanna Newsom’s catalogue isavailable on BandcampExplore more on these topicsRankedJoanna NewsomIndieExperimental musicVan Dyke ParksSteve AlbinifeaturesShareReuse this content"

But on the other hand, I’m alive. I can work.”Skarsgård, 74, said he was “not afraid of dying, but I am afraid of not being capable of living. That is a fear.“I feel a little more like I live under the sword now,” he continued. “Because I’ve lived a naughty life.

Luckily, none of them were.”A number of Skarsgård’s children – including Alexander, Bill and Gustaf – are actors, but he rejected the idea that they had been successful on account of their father.“I consider myself a nepo daddy,” he said, “because I get so much goodwill and maybe jobs because of them.” Both he and Alexander had films screening at the Telluride film festival in late August, he continued, recalling that when his eldest son exited the Sentimental Value screening “he came out, destroyed in his face, and he hugged me.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFilm WeeklyFree newsletterTake a front seat at the cinema with our weekly email filled with all the latest news and all the movie action that mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Stupid jokes, emotional depth, one of the best comic creations on TV, Seth Rogen: it’s so easy to buy into this showRachel AroestiThu 23 Oct 2025 03.01 EDTLast modified on Thu 23 Oct 2025 12.41 EDTShareThe course of true love is notoriously unsmooth, but for Noah and Joanne – protagonists of charming LA-set romcom Nobody Wants This – it has been especially rough. The problem? Noah is a religious leader and Joanne is an agnostic sex podcaster. Therealproblem? Noah is a rabbi and Joanne is – as his disapproving mother puts it – a “shiksa”. Otherwise known as Not a Jew.Is that a dealbreaker? Season one seemed to suggest so. After finally getting together with Noah (Adam Brody), Joanne (Kristen Bell) pledged to convert to Judaism. But then she changed her mind, coming to the realisation that adopting a faith for logistical reasons wasn’t the most morally upstanding thing to do. So she dumped him. This was also an admirable decision, ethically speaking; Joanne didn’t want to force Noah to choose between her and his life’s calling.True love, however, is also notoriously hard to rationalise away. The last time we saw the pair, Noah had just sprinted after a downcast Joanne and admitted it was true, he couldn’t have both – before leaning in for a big old snog. This wasn’t just a classic romcom climax, it was also a cliffhanger. Our couple had both just agreed their relationship had no future; could this turn out to be Netflix’s most nihilistic romantic comedy to date? If not, how was the show going to write itself out of this dead end?By ignoring it, largely. As we reunite with Joanne and Noah in season two, you’d be forgiven for assuming none of it really mattered at all. Instead, we’re confronted with love’s young-ish dream (Brody and Bell are both 45, and although the ages of their characters are not explicitly revealed, they appear to be in their late 30s). Their most pressing concerns range from the quotidian (will their first joint dinner party be a success?) to the niche (should Joanne discuss Noah’s classy bedside water carafes on her podcast?). Admittedly, their relationship does have real-world ramifications when Noah is overlooked for his dream job of head rabbi. But it doesn’t mean he can’t be a rabbi at all, and he quickly lands a new position at a more progressive temple (helmed by the mystifyingly underused comic dream team of Seth Rogen and Kate Berlant).Still, the question of conversion continues to hover around Joanne and Noah’s romantic bliss. Nobody Wants This is inspired by creator Erin Foster’s own experience of converting to Judaism after falling in love with a Jewish man, so we can broadly assume where things are going. But how to get there? Joanne hopes she might gradually become enthusiastic about the religion, but unlike her woo-woo mother – who suddenly develops an eyeroll-inducing connection to the faith during a Purim party – she’s (relatably) sceptical about the idea of suddenly justfeelingJewish.View image in fullscreenJustine Lupe as Morgan and Arian Moayed as Andy in Nobody Wants This.Photograph: Erin Simkin/NetflixYet a more prosaic approach can also feel jarring. At one point, Noah’s sister-in-law Esther pitches Judaism as something like the religious equivalent of hygge, telling Joanne she is “warm and cosy” therefore “basically Jewish”. She’s “funny” (“that’s Jewish!”), is “always getting in everybody’s business” and “love[s] to overshare” too – things which also make her a perfect fit for the religion. To equate affectionate Jewish archetypes (which are, at the end of the day, simply human archetypes) with the religion itself – one which hasquitea lot of rules (especially if you’re marrying a rabbi) – seems rather shallow.Luckily, Nobody Wants This continues to be remarkably strong in other areas. The chemistry between Brody – still able to trade on the heart-throb status he accrued two decades ago playing beautiful nerd Seth Cohen in The OC – and Bell, who specialises in acid-tongued cool, remains electric. The brattiness and barely disguised fragility of Joanne’s younger sister and podcast co-host Morgan (Succession’s Justine Lupe) makes her one of the best comic creations currently on our screens. This time round, she gets a proper love interest – although sadly it’s love-bombing therapist Dr Andy (Succession’s Arian Moayed). It’s a storyline that lends itself to both stupid jokes and emotional depth, as does the subplot involving Morgan’s friendship with Noah’s elder brother Sasha (Veep’s Timothy Simons), a goofy source of advice grappling with his own marital strife.With a respectable joke rate – though we’re talking smirk-inducing wisecracks rather than belly laughs – and a steady stream of keenly observed details (Joanne’s palpable delight at getting the pious Noah to properly kvetch; Noah’s nice-guy credentials crumbling ever-so-slightly when Joanne finds out how he treated previous partners), Nobody Wants This is easy to buy into and easy to love. Especially if – like the show itself – you don’t think too hard about the knotty theological dilemma at its core.Nobody Wants This is on Netflix nowExplore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewreviewsShareReuse this content"

His mum and dad were two hard-working actor-comedians who had a very successful TV double act in the 60s and 70s and a long marriage. This has been the source of so much material, based on the quarrels and tensions to which Ben and his sister Amy were intimate witnesses.Both parents’ backgrounds were hard. Anne’s mother had taken her own life; Jerry’s dad was tough and unsupportive. Perhaps they never experienced the full status of stardom that their son has enjoyed, although Jerry had a new lease of late-life TV fame in the 90s with his superb portrayal of George Costanza’s dad in Seinfeld. The film is centred on Ben and Amy clearing out their mum and dad’s New York apartmentafter Jerry died in 2020; Anne haddied in 2015. And Ben Stiller himself emerges as a complex and unresolved personality from this film: he considers the fact that his parents were sometimes not there for him because of the pressures of show business, and that he himself was not around for his own children because of being away on film sets. He and his wife Christine Taylor separated for three years but reunited in 2020.And perhaps Ben has discovered something that Jerry and Meara discovered – but suppressed and kept smiling like the troupers that they were. Show business is a cruel vocation not simply because it takes you away from your family, but because it always promises a level of superstar euphoria that is fleeting, or never arrives at all; someone else is more successful than you, someone else has more awards, someone else’s project gets commissioned. When Amy tells Ben on camera how tough it was for her to be waitressing while he was becoming a movie star, he can only smile sadly.There is also an intriguing and very revealing sketch that Ben did as a young kid, based on family therapy sessions they once had, when the comically obnoxious Ben tells Jerry the father is less famous than the son. Then Amy infuriates Ben with an anecdote about him wetting the bed. An intriguing, bittersweet family study.Stiller & Meara: Nothing Is Lost is on Apple TV+ from 24 October.Explore more on these topicsFilmDocumentary filmsBen StillerComedy filmsTV comedySeinfeldParents and parentingreviewsShareReuse this content"

But it quickly expands, exploring the killing’s influence on the emerging folk-horror film genre, particularly 1973’s The Wicker Man, and almost reachingAdam Curtis-type grand sociology in mining these pop-cultural ley lines for what they say about the British psyche.After Walton was found on Meon Hill with a pitchfork pushed through his head and a billhook in his neck, rumour soon spread that his murder was ritualistic. When the Warwickshire police called in crack Scotland Yard inspector Robert Fabian to lead the investigation, he was comprehensively stonewalled by the villagers. The notorious case set a blueprint for the you-ain’t-from-round-’ere tone of 60s and 70s rustic horror: the likes of The Plague of the Zombies and The Blood on Satan’s Claw. In parallel, there was a real-life hippy-era increase in witchcraft and paganism, influenced by and influencing the films.Director Rupert Russell (son of Ken) makes a convincing case that the particulars of the Walton case, and the way its bloodstain permeated out into postwar culture, reflected a particular British insularity, unruliness and furtive violence that still persist today. Even if the killing wasn’t occult, what counted was the belief that it was. And the subsequent pagan business in Notting Hill squats and on cinema screens was on some level re-enacting atavistic compulsions newly seductive in a diminished, post-empire Britain. “Better the devil you know,” as one of the ghoulishly lit interviewees says here.It is a sophisticated analysis, clued in to how real life and fiction combine to stir up the silt of the imagination in ways propitious to manifesting the supernatural. At one point, sightings of a supposed vampire in Highgate Cemetery inspired the 1972 Hammer film Dracula AD 1972; only it turns out that what the terrified Londoners may have seen was an earlier Hammer production shooting in the graveyard. In this attunement to how art shapes the mind, and in its own incantatory stream of imagery, Russell’s film comes close to participating in this magic circle itself.Caught in this delirium, it never goes back to Lower Quinton to introduce some reality into the subject. Leave it to one housewife, asked why she is uneasy about the coven down the road, to introduce a note of sobriety as British as the teatime paganism: “Lack of knowledge – if you don’t know anything about a subject, you get nervous. You get frightened.”The Last Sacrifice is at theIrish Film Institute, Dublin, on 26 October, then touring.Explore more on these topicsFilmDocumentary filmsCrimeHorror filmsThe Wicker ManreviewsShareReuse this content"

All six works here are familiar fare, the common thread being the late-19th and early 20th-century French enthusiasm for all things Spanish. It’s the kind of programme the record industry thrived on in the 1960s and 70s. There’s nothing dusty about the playing, however, nor the state-of-the-art recording, which possesses sonic depth while leaving plenty of space for the music’s delicate perfumes to waft to the surface.View image in fullscreenAlbum cover art for Iberia.Photograph: OnyxFor all his reserves of Venezuelan fire, Hindoyan takes a measured approach, resisting the temptation to grandstand. The results are frequently revelatory, with much that strikes the ear anew: diaphanous textures, addictive Latin rhythms and perfectly judged releases of musical adrenaline. Listen, for example, to the colours he brings out in Chabrier’s España, the RLPO firing on all cylinders with opulent tone and distinguished solos.Ravel’s Alborada del Gracioso, every detail immaculately crafted, explodes with energy, wriggling its hips while cocking an irreverent snook. Ibéria, the central panel of Debussy’s three orchestral Images, comes up fresh as a daisy, swinging, sultry and celebratory in turn.

Tom and Amy have been together for 30 years. He believes theirs to be a “C-minus marriage” which was irreparably ruptured when Amy had an affair 12 years previously. And so, after leaving their daughter Miriam at college in Pittsburgh, he keeps on driving, revisiting old friends and places in search of his departed youth.Benjamin Markovits’s 12th novel – which has been shortlisted for this year’s Booker prize – could be seen as a companion piece to Miranda July’s celebratedAll Foursin its exploration of the dissatisfaction of middle age. Tom is not a reliable narrator of his life, though he is nonetheless a compelling protagonist even in his flagrant moments of self-deception.The voice actor Eric Meyers is the narrator who expertly conveys Tom’s bubbling discontent, even if there’s a slight panto quality to his voicing of female characters. We gradually gather there are wider issues fomenting Tom’s unhappiness, from a simmering illness that he imagines is long Covid, and about which he has so far declined to see a doctor, to the forced sabbatical from his job following complaints from his students. Tom, who hasn’t told his wife about his work difficulties, clearly believes he is more sinned against than sinning. But much like July’s nameless heroine in All Fours, he finds freedom and fresh perspective on the open road.Available via Faber, 6hr 56min.Further listeningDon’t Make Me LaughJulia Raeside, Bedford Square & WF Howes, 11hr 13minElizabeth Bower reads this smart, insightful debut set in the world of comedy in which female producer with self-esteem issues befriends a male performer whose attentiveness masks a dark and predatory agenda.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Institutions are failing, or reassembling themselves along new and disquieting lines. An unseen force “is destroying the air and the seasons”; at the same time, “money’s going bad, and no one knows why”. Power is flowing away from governments, and pooling in the offices of theocrats, the coffers of conglomerates, the hands of mobs. “Something is at work, very quietly, very subtly”, says merchant Mustafa Bey, keeping a watchful eye on the Silk Roads from his seat in an Aleppo cafe. “Things we thought were firm and solid are weakening and giving way.”Just what that something might be, and how to counteract it, is the question that animates The Rose Field, which picks up whereThe Secret Commonwealthleft off. This is, by all accounts, Pullman’s concluding foray into the intricately constructed, infinitely beguiling realm he first unveiled 30 years ago, with the publication of Northern Lights. It’s a realm whose geography maps on to that of this world, but whose history tacks and jibes with ours; where the humans look and think and act like us, but are accompanied by daemons, souls in animal form; where the skies are filled with witches and gryphons, but beneath those skies, buses are caught and tea is drunk, and middle-aged academics carry Harrods shopping bags. Lyra, whom we first met as a 12-year-old in the His Dark Materials trilogy, and then saw again as a baby inLa Belle Sauvage, the prequel with which Pullman began The Book of Dust, is now a young woman: still recognisably the spiky and tenacious heroine of the earlier books, but older, sadder, more cautious, less certain. This circumscription is amplified by her separation from her daemon, Pantalaimon – but it was also, ironically, the trigger which caused him to abandon her in the first place.Pan’s decision to go off in search of that childlike part of Lyra which she seems to have lost (an aspect which he epitomises as her “imagination”), and her quest to reunite with him, were the incitements of The Secret Commonwealth, which saw Lyra undertake a picaresque journey across Europe and into the Caucasus, meeting with marvel and danger on the way. But from the outset, deeper currents were in motion, and darker forces at work. The Magisterium – the church’s governing authority, and Pullman’s deliciously chilling embodiment of austere, bureaucratic evil – is under new leadership, and flexing its muscles. Marcel Delamare – Lyra’s uncle, who blames her for his sister’s death – has manoeuvred himself into the role of president of the Magisterium’s High Council, and is intent on using his newfound power to extend the church’s dominium. Malcolm Polstead, who carried baby Lyra to safety along a flooded Thames as an 11-year-old in La Belle Sauvage, is now an Oxford don with a sideline in intelligence work: he is dispatched to Geneva to find out more about Delamare’s intentions. And behind all of this is the mystery surrounding the rare and valuable rose oil which seems somehow to be the source of a social and economic crisis rippling out from Central Asia. The oil is seen by some as a tradeable commodity, by others as a scientific or spiritual miracle, and by others still – the fanatical “men from the mountains” – as a source of evil; an affront that must be obliterated. The question of where it comes from, what it stands for, and whether it should be destroyed or protected is coming rapidly to the fore.As in His Dark Materials, Lyra’s actions, and her destiny, are revealed to be inextricably entwined with the fate of the worldIn The Secret Commonwealth, these storylines ran broadly in parallel. In The Rose Field, they converge. As in His Dark Materials, Lyra’s actions and her destiny are revealed to be inextricably entwined with the fate of the world. Her personal quest to reunite with her daemon and recover her imagination becomes the key battleground in a wider war with an authoritarian regime which, as such regimes always have, is seeking to quell independence of thought, creativity and art: all the internal, rebellious ways in which people can be free.The novel begins with the discovery of a series of curious fissures in the fabric of the Earth’s atmosphere: windows that seem to give on to other worlds. One such window appears to be the source of the highly contested rose oil. The Magisterium, with Delamare at its head, designates these windows as a challenge to the church’s orthodoxy and sets out to eradicate them. As Lyra begins to turn away from rigid rationalism and back to intuition, however, her conviction that these sites must be protected – that what they stand for and what they offer is somehow essential – grows. “Dust, or rose oil, or the imagination, or the Rose Field, or whatever we call it,” she says, “we need it.” The stage for a Blakean tussle between innocence and experience is set.At 640 pages, The Rose Field gives itself the time it needs to bring Pullman’s trilogy to a fitting conclusion, but there are points when it seems to wend its way rather too circuitously to a close. Minor characters are on occasion introduced without definite purpose, and there are moments where apparent advances in the narrative turn out to be cul-de-sacs. But the story’s internal motor is strong enough to carry us over these digressions. Lyra’s journey into adulthood feels both painful and plausible and, once again, Pullman uses her relationship with her daemon to reify and explore her internal struggles in a manner that is unique to his imaginative universe. Malcolm is an unexpectedly successful replacement for Will, Lyra’s foil in the first trilogy: he is a rich, full character in his own right, and his feelings for Lyra, and hers for him, offer a complex, adult counterpoint to the relationship between Will and Lyra in His Dark Materials. Pullman’s uncanny ability to conjure place, meanwhile, is once again in full evidence: the snows of Svalbard and Oxford’s clutter of rooftops are exchanged for the Silk Roads’ sweeping deserts and soaring mountains. And when we reach it, the novel’s final showdown is a fantastically nail‑biting ride.Endings, though, are always difficult, and for Pullman, the challenge is compounded by the fact that His Dark Materials delivered one of the most emotionally and intellectually satisfying conclusions in modern literature. In The Book of Dust, by contrast, there is a sense of threads left unknotted; ends only lightly tucked away. But this feels, in the final analysis, like an intentional choice on Pullman’s part: the ultimate reflection of the fact that The Book of Dust is a story for grownups, not children, and storybook endings are another casualty of the putting away of childish things. “There are no endings,” said Hilary Mantel on the final page ofBring Up the Bodies; “they are all beginnings.” Pullman draws his great matter to a close, but he’s clear that his characters, and their stories, will continue without him – that the end of his book marks the start of their next chapter. “We need the things we can’t explain, can’t prove, or else we die of suffocation,” says Lyra, towards the end of the novel. With The Book of Dust, Pullman has given us room to breathe.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

But at what cost?James BallThu 23 Oct 2025 04.00 EDTShareIf the name Bryan Johnson isn’t familiar, a picture of him might be. He is the somewhat alien-looking, strangely ageless 48-year-old Californian battling to defy death itself.His efforts to do so have involved receiving a transfusion of blood plasma from his then 17-year-old son, an act thatattracted headlinesaround the world, while Johnson’s own plasma was in turn transfused into his father. What was largely missed, but is documented in Alex Krotoski’s book, is that the procedure was deemed to be a failure. The tech entrepreneur will have to find another way to live for ever.Even so, Johnson remains the pallid face of a global crusade to defeat death, radically extend human lifespan, and reclassify (and perhaps even stigmatise) ageing as a disease, rather than an integral part of the human experience. Krotoski, a psychologist and veteran chronicler of the tech industry, is well positioned to investigate and explain the phenomenon.Her book is at its strongest when it explores the contradictions inherent in the movement, as well as its social consequences. Johnson might be a well-known figure, but Molly and Kris Nadell are not. Krotoski visits the couple, both in their 40s, because of the way they scrape together just enough money to continue living in their RV, in which they raise their two children.The Nadells both donate plasma, often twice a week or more, earning between $30 and $70 a time. Maintaining this meagre income requires them to navigate online forums in search of advice on keeping their iron levels high so their donations aren’t rejected, and for tips on how to circumvent limits on donations. In a bitter irony, ageing is their nemesis, too. “The older you get, the less demand for your plasma … Kris and Molly are in their mid-forties. Their pay-per-litre is already going down.”Krotoski approaches the life-extensionists with appropriate scepticism, noting many of them have backgrounds in technology, not medical science, and an attitude that, in some, seems to border on the cult-like. Johnson’s regimen involves 150 or more supplements per day, and meals that resemble nothing so much as the contents of a baby’s nappy. She shows, rather than tells, and leaves the reader to decide who cuts a credible figure and whose arguments ought to be dismissed.One thing is clear: stubborn reality is not on the movement’s sideThe Immortalists is not without its flaws, though. Krotoski tackles so much at once that the experience can feel like being jerked about on a lead from one topic to another, without much in the way of a through-line. Some chapters are rich, character-led journeys, while others require the reader to wade through dense, stat-heavy exposition. Parts of it will feel very familiar to anyone who listened to Krotoski’s 2023 BBC series on the subject.And in a book otherwise very conscious of the societal impact of the actions of the men it covers, it is jarring to hear no mention of the allegations made against Johnson by his former fiancee, who brought a lawsuit against him in 2021alleging“manipulative and coercive behavior”. As a former employee she was required to settle her claims against him through anarbitrationprocess, which ruled in Johnson’s favour. He has consistently denied all wrongdoing.Reading The Immortalists, you at times feel unmoored from reality, in much the same way as some of its subjects. They argue about whether a lifespan of 120 years or 1,000 is possible, if it will take five to 10 years to get there or longer, whether immortality will come via fusion with AI, or through medical means. Krotoski puts these discussions in historical perspective, linking them to the fountain of youth and the philosopher’s stone. Is it really a matter of science this time, or does it come down to faith, just as it always did?One thing is clear: stubborn reality is not on the movement’s side. In developed countries, improvements in life expectancy have all but ground to a halt, and in some cases even reversed slightly. Trump’s health secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr, haspulled fundingfor all kinds of promising research. The question of eternal life feels distant from more immediate concerns.“My biggest fear with Bryan Johnson,” one life-extension advocate frets to Krotoski, “is that he dies.” A few hundred thousand years of human history suggests that the outlook on that front might not be great. For now, at least, the movement still lives in hope that the inevitable may, in fact, be optional.The Immortalists: The Death of Death and the Race for Eternal Life by Aleks Krotoski is published by Bodley Head (£22).

Is this game stupid, or am I the stupid one for playing it?Keza MacDonaldThu 23 Oct 2025 04.45 EDTLast modified on Thu 23 Oct 2025 06.03 EDTShareInstead of doing anything normal with my life for the past week, I have been on a horrible hiking holiday with the worst man in the world. In Baby Steps, you play as a useless imbecile called Nate who has done basically nothing with his 35 years on this planet except sit in his parents’ basement and watch anime re-runs. One day he is transported, in his adult onesie, to the foot of a surreal mountain decorated with phallic imagery, and you must get him to the top by controlling his feet individually, lifting them carefully with the controller’s triggers and placing them with the analogue stick.This is ludicrously difficult. Sometimes you’re marching up an easy slope, but you’re often edging over narrow planks, scrambling up dunes with tiny steps, or grasping rocky ledges with his toes. Over and over Nate trips and tumbles, whining piteously as he slides down a muddy slope or bank of sand, his onesie becoming increasingly soiled. Over and over, you get up and try again. Occasionally an Australian guy with crazy eyes or a pantsless donkey man with dangling genitals shows up to gently mock you and offer help that Nate, infuriatingly, refuses to accept.View image in fullscreenEarly on in the game, Nate is offered shoes. Does he take the shoes? Of course not. (To be fair to him, they’re slightly big.)Photograph: Devolver DigitalIf your concentration slips for a second, so will he. Three hours into my time with this ridiculous game, having taken an epic tumble from a plank into a river, I stomped Nate dejectedly around a corner to discover the campsite where I had begun my hike that morning. In the meantime I had achieved nothing besides finding a silly propellor hat, which was itself an extra burden as I had to bend down and pick it up whenever I fell over. Rarely has a game made me want to cry, but when I saw that campsite, I very nearly gave up.Imagine enduring setbacks like this for hours, and then ending up in a warren with a lantern that Nate keeps dropping, leaving you in the pitch dark unless you backtrack to retrieve it. And then, halfway through, there is adownescalator that you must ascend in one try, unless you want to spend long seconds staring at Nate’s upturned rear as he descends slowly to the bottom after a stumble. Andthen, the way out is a spiralling path of sand ledges, on which Nate’s feet keep losing purchase. I was stuck in there for aeons, with nothing but my thoughts, my increasing frustration and Nate for company. Baby Steps reaches impressive new sadistic heights with every succeeding chapter.So why keep playing? Apart from sheer bloody-mindedness that I probably need to unpack with a therapist – I willnotlet this game break me – there are a couple of things going on here. It is exceptionally funny, not just in the obvious slapstick way (it is very, very amusing watching Nate twerk his way down a mudslide) but in its improvised dialogue and absurd delivery. The developers behind this game also voice the characters, and every cutscene you find is a little treat among the travails. An optional challenge in the desert has you trying to get a trophy made of ice up a desert slope before it melts, and as Nate returns repeatedly to the ice-cream cart man with increasing desperation, the developers voicing them also start to lose their grip.And though this might look like a mean-spirited game about laughing at a pathetic man falling over, it turns out to have more to say. As much as I hated Nate at times, to the point where I almost quit playing just so I didn’t have to look at his flailing arse anymore, I also started to feel for him. He is a true one-man taxonomy of loserdom, but he’s alsotrying. Despite extreme social anxiety, masculine insecurity and evident self-hatred, he’s putting one foot in front of the other, in the game’s extremely literal metaphor.If you arrive at the end of a chapter wearing a hat, then you get to play a depressing little 8-bit style minigame about Nate’s former life: his disappointed parents, his overachieving sister, his nonexistent sex life. As the hours passed I got some insight into how Nate ended up in the state he’s in, and though I never related to him directly as some players have, I started to feel almost maternal towards him, unwilling to give up on him despite everything.This game has also brought out my worst self, cursing vehemently at this pallid man whenever one of his useless feet slips from what I thought was a sure hold. But for all the appallingly dispiriting moments, there are also times when you feel like weeping with gratitude after finally persevering enough to get Nate to the next stage of his journey. Baby Steps is silly, but it isn’t stupid. In 30 years of playing games I’ve not played anything like it. It’s made me think and feel surprisingly deeply for a game about falling over.One of my less consequential failuresTo see everything this game has to offer would take a level of masochism to which it is unwise to aspire. After 10 hours or so, I just wanted to get to the end of it. That’s when I came across a massive spiral staircase, extending upwards to the clouds. To the right: a perilous cliffside path that our Australian guide calls the Manbreaker. “You can’t. It’s too hard for you,” he says. “You’re gonna be bashing your head against this thing for the next five years … you’re gonna break down and take these fuckin’ stairs.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toPushing ButtonsFree weekly newsletterKeza MacDonald's weekly look at the world of gamingEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Twentysomething Niall is deeply distressed and calls his sister, Brigid, in an attempt to stem his agony and slow his racing mind. Their conversation is surprisingly funny as Brigid, who keeps whispering to someone in bed beside her, attempts to placate her brother. The dialogue brims with affection, frustration, fear and sorrow, as well as an electric tension as we wait for Niall – clearly on the edge of doing something quite terrible – to make up his mind.That’s just the opening scene of Eoin McAndrew’s vivid new play. The winner of the 2024 Verity Bargate award, it is quite hard to categorise but very easy to admire and enjoy. As Niall attempts to recover from his breakdown, the play initially verges on satire. A bewildered Brigid (Catherine Rees) is met with a barrage of absurd advice, as she tries to keep her brother – who has just set himself on fire – from further self-harm. Stashing the candles away, suggests McAndrew, probably isn’t going to fix this.View image in fullscreenSpiky … Laura Dos Santos (left) and Catherine Rees in Little Brother.Photograph: Camilla GreenwellIn Emma Jordan’s assured production, the satirical sections are aided by spikily comic performances from Laura Dos Santos (as a doctor and counsellor) and Conor O’Donnell (as Brigid’s sidelined and increasingly sulky boyfriend). McAndrew’s writing pulses with fury at a care system that is even more broken than the swathes of people who need help. However, despite being funny and pointed, these scenes also jar a little next to the subtler and more effective domestic scenes between Brigid, her boyfriend and her brother.Barrier(s) review – tender yet tough account of a queer couple’s connectionRead moreRecent graduate Cormac McAlinden captivates as Niall, who is such a convincing muddle of feelings – corrosively disturbed but also capable of silliness, tenderness, pettiness and joy. In one unforgettable scene, McAlinden claws at himself, scrapes at the floor, rages and bounces off the walls of Zoë Hurwitz’s striking set, a series of interlocking white cubes, blank and confining. The periphery of the set throbs and glows, revealing a series of pipes – the inner workings of a troubled city, a restless body and a disturbed mind.AtSoho theatre, London, until 22 NovemberIn the UK and Ireland,Samaritanscan be contacted on freephone 116 123, or emailjo@samaritans.orgorjo@samaritans.ie.

That’s what we’re hoping,” said Melissa Gustin, the curator of British art at National MuseumsLiverpool. But by the end it will all make perfect sense, she hopes. “That is the vibe we are after. We want visitors to see the connections, the histories and the legacies.”This year is the250th anniversary of Turner’s birth, which has meant a lot of Turner shows around the world. Gustin has counted at least 24.She has spent two years curating the Turner show at theWalker Art Gallery in Liverpool, which opens to the public on Saturday.For her, the challenge was to showcase Liverpool’s incredible collection of Turners, one of the finest outside London, but also offer something different – which is why the show explores Turner’s impact and legacy on later generations of artists.The show argues that Turner was grappling with many issues that are still a problem today, whether climate breakdown, immigration, or what the role of the artist is.“Of course, if people only want to engage with the Turners, that’s fine,” Gustin said. “There are plenty of them to look at. If people only want to engage with the modern and contemporary, there’s plenty of that as well.”Fortunately for Liverpool, a good number of the city’s rich 19th-century art patrons collected late Turner works when it was unfashionable.It means Liverpool has Turner paintings such asThe Falls of the Clyde, a favourite at the Lady Lever Gallery, andThe Wreck Buoy, normally on display at Sudley House.According to John Ruskin, Turner’s friend and champion, The Wreck Buoy, a dramatically violent seascape with crashing waves and a dazzling rainbow, was the “last oil picture he painted before his noble hand forgot its cunning”.At the new exhibition, it is displayed next to a work where danger and death also loom – a Hirst work with two small sharks in formaldehyde, apparently swimming in a loop.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toArt WeeklyFree weekly newsletterYour weekly art world round-up, sketching out all the biggest stories, scandals and exhibitionsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It’s perhaps no surprise then that The Shelter of Stories, a new exhibition curated by the leading mythographer, contains much to tingle spines as well as tickle fancies.There are artworks drawing on alternative folkloric worlds by top contemporary artists such asPaula Regoor Kiki Smith, while old master paintings confront spiritual or social horrors. It boasts a wealth of offbeat ephemera too, including Red Riding Hood as an early kids’ board game and taxidermy dioramas with a rodent fortune teller and avian peddler of love potions. The curator’s own collection of Mexican Ex Voto paintings shows how ordinary people have recorded and given thanks for overcoming their own dramas, be it fire or an inconvenient spouse.The works span centuries but Warner is driven by present-day concerns. It was her recent project with refugees,Stories in Transit, that prompted her to create the show, which follows her recent bookSanctuaryin unpacking how storytelling can build bridges in an increasingly divided world. “The shelter of stories,” she explains, “is about a tale told in a circle of listeners, all remembering, embellishing and making up the story, with bonds created between strangers by doing it together.” Thus, the exhibition’s emphasis is less on what stories are being told than how.The connection between storytelling and refuge is underlined by artworks such as Yinka Shonibare’s scaled-down recreations of historical safehouses, including a waypoint on the underground railway used by enslaved Africans escaping to the American north, and Mounira Al Solh’s textiles, which hang tent-like from the ceiling. Their embroideries and silkscreened lettering reference conflict in Lebanon and the myths and histories circling the cedar tree on the country’s flag.Although such works touch on real events, the kind of storytelling that interests Warner is not the eye-witness account. While she affirms that “testimony is vital to everyone’s personhood and visibility”, she sees the legal framework that demands refugees must repeatedly recount their circumstances in this way without any deviation or change, as “diminishing our freedom as individuals because we all tell our stories differently for different people”.What Warner makes the case for is storytelling’s potential to create an imaginative space where “we reach beyond the borders of our own experience”. It’s a point evinced by the huge variety of props on show and through which tellers bring characters to life, from Punch and Judy to Indonesian shadow puppets used in Hindu Sanskrit tales, or the headdresses from Nigeria’s Yoruba Egungun masquerades.The exhibition is a reminder, too, of the storytelling traditions that give the downtrodden an outlet. “Laughter is a corrective to abusive power,” says Warner. “It’s the recourse of the underdog, the underprivileged, anybody who is crushed.” The show mines the age-old art of lampooning, from the animal with human follies in cautionary tales like Aesop’s Fables to the political satire in Jonathan Baldock’s giant mask installation Pa Abu of 2015, reviving the impulsive tyrant from Alfred Jarry’s absurdist 1886 play Ubu Roi.Baldock’s despot with his lolling red tongue recalls today’s King Ubus and their divisive, polarising narratives. What undergirds the huge variety of stories on show here though, from Greek epics to the Brothers Grimm, is that they’re collective efforts, cross-pollinated travelling tales that have passed through different places and cultures, with fears faced by people getting together around the fireside. Warner cites famed lines by the playwright Bertolt Brecht as a guiding principle: “In the dark times, will there be singing? Yes, there will also be singing. About the dark times.”The Shelter of Stories: Ways of Telling, Ways of Dwelling is at Compton Verney, Warwick,25 Octoberto 22 February.Myth congeniality: works on display at the exhibitionPaula Rego: Secrets and Stories, 1989 (main image)Rego depicts her huddled women and children telling tales like little islands in the dark, their rapt faces apparently illuminated by delight at what they’re hearing. “It’s about personal stories and alternative informal networks,” says Warner.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Hugh Pryor/Photography HughSaad Qureshi: A Handful of Paradise, 2024Drawn from conversations with people of all faiths, Bradford-born sculptor Saad Qureshi’s A Handful of Paradise is an exquisitely detailed landscape with a delicate tower in enclosed gardens.

Alana (Em Prendergast) is hearing, while Katie (Zoë McWhinney) is deaf.Created by Deafinitely Theatre, which blends British Sign Language and spoken English, the play moves from the initial awkwardness of their first meeting at a kids’ party, through Alana’s early missteps, into a big, heart-on-sleeve portrait of their relationship’s highs and lows.Eloise Pennycott’s script unfolds episodically: one year, Alana struggles with the basics of BSL; the next, the couple sign to each other with ease. From the outset, electricity runs between them, shown best in quiet sections of movement directed by Raffie Julien. McWhinney and Prendergast build Katie and Alana’s relationship into one of tenderness and care. Each look is charged by their connection, and there’s a lot of laughter between them, too.Staged by the company’s artistic director, Paula Garfield, the play has a sugary, storybook quality at first: sketches appear across a back wall to establish the setting of each scene. Together, the couple celebrate anniversaries and dream about their future: even when they argue, it’s not long before they are back in each other’s arms.Underneath the romance is the reality of a broken, unfair system. Even while pregnant, it takes Katie weeks to get a doctor’s appointment with a BSL interpreter and the school for deaf children where she works is constantly under threat of closure. Marie Zschommler’s sound design swells with anger in moments of tension and the sense of injustice is stark.The ending breaks away from everything that’s come before as the script is literally torn up and the pair launch into a celebration of Deaf culture. It is uplifting, but the breaking-the-fourth-wall shift feels overfamiliar. Frustratingly, it leaves the main story hanging, and with so much life thrown into Alana and Katie, we long to properly bid them farewell. Still, it’s definitely important, hard-hitting stuff from a company that continues to educate and entertain.AtBirmingham Repuntil 25 October.

No cause of death was given.His partner in Soft Cell,Marc Almond, paid tribute, writing: “He was a wonderfully brilliant musical genius … Thank you Dave for being an immense part of my life and for the music you gave me. I wouldn’t be where I am without you”.Born in Chester in 1959 to a single mother and named Paul, he was adopted and given the name David Ball, and raised in Blackpool alongside an adopted sister, Susan. The resort town rubbed off on Ball who cited its “showbizzy” side – “the funfairs and the craziness” – as an influence on his music career, as well as his father’s engineering background getting him interested in electronics. He cited hearing Kraftwerk’s Autobahn in 1975 as a “turning point” in his life.After his father died of cancer, he left Ball some money which he spent on a guitar, soon trading it in for a synthesiser. He moved to study art at Leeds Polytechnic – “I was just desperate to get away and start my own life”, he said – where the first person he met was Almond. “There was this one guy wandering around with a leopard-skin top, bleached hair and spandex trousers, and I thought, ‘he’s got to be in the art department, he’s not an accountant’, so I asked him, ‘do you know where I enrol?’”, Ball later remembered.View image in fullscreen‘We were a weird couple: Marc, this gay bloke in makeup; and me, a big guy who looked like a minder’ … Ball (background) and Almond in 2002.Photograph: Lex van Rossen/MAI/RedfernsThey formed the duo Soft Cell in 1979. The flamboyant frontman Almond was into pop-soul and 60s ballads, while the more reserved Ball had an interest in synths and “machine music”, as he called it. “We were a weird couple: Marc, this gay bloke in makeup; and me, a big guy who looked like a minder,”he told the Guardian in 2017, but this seeming disconnect resulted in a dynamic and striking kind of pop.Ball handed a copy of their debut EP to BBC Radio 1 DJ John Peel who played it on his show, and the duo were signed to the label Some Bizzare. Their first singles A Man Could Get Lost and Memorabilia flopped, but their next was a sensation.Tainted Love was a cover of a song by American soul singer Gloria Jones, which had never had chart success but had become much-loved on the northern soul scene in the north of England; Almond has said he was influenced by another version, by English singer Ruth Swann. Soft Cell’s 1981 cover version went to No 1 in the UK, and became the second-biggest seller that year after the Human League’s Don’t You Want Me. It also reached No 1 in 16 other countries, and was a US Top 10 hit. The success took Soft Cell by surprise: “We were living in a dodgy little housing association flat in Leeds and being flown about on Concorde,” Ball said.View image in fullscreenMarc Almond and Dave Ball in 1983.Photograph: Eugene Adebari/ShutterstockTainted Love was the first of five UK Top 10 hits in a row, namely Bedsitter; Say Hello, Wave Goodbye; Torch, and What. Their debut album Non-Stop Erotic Cabaret went platinum in the UK, despite containing substantially edgier fare than Tainted Love, its lyrics nodding to S&M, pornography and sexual frustration.The follow-up The Art of Falling Apart reached No 5, but the hard-partying duo amicably split in early 1984, and released an underperforming post-breakup album, This Last Night in Sodom. “We were taking too many dodgy substances and getting into weird nonsense,” said Ball, who had become a father in his early 20s but found drug addiction was “tearing me apart”.After Soft Cell, Ball toyed with short-lived groups Other People, Ornamental and English Boy on the Loveranch, and collaborated with Throbbing Gristle’s Genesis P-Orridge on soundtracks to the films Decoder and Imagining October (the latter directed by Derek Jarman).He then had a successful and sustained collaboration with musician Richard Norris, as the Grid, formed in 1988. The duo, supplemented by guest musicians, were born out of the acid house era and created pumping rave tracks touched with cosmic psychedelia. By 1993 they had reached the Top 30 in the UK with the singles Crystal Clear and Texas Cowboys. Their next track Swamp Thing – powered by a high-speed banjo line – became an international smash and reached No 3 in the UK charts.Norris also paid tribute, writing: “Being in a duo with someone is different from being in a band: the bond is very tight. That’s how it was with us … Thanks for the good times, the endless laughter, your unwavering friendship. Most of all, thank you for the music.”During the 1990s Ball also worked as a producer for other artists, including Kylie Minogue, working on tracks for her 1997 album Impossible Princess including the Top 20 single Breathe.View image in fullscreenThe duo performing at the O2 Arena, London, in 2018.Photograph: Jim Dyson/Getty ImagesSoft Cell reformed in 2000 for live dates, then released a new album Cruelty Without Beauty in 2002; another northern soul cover, of the Four Seasons’ The Night, took them back to the Top 40. Almond said in his tribute: “Whenever we came back together after long periods apart there was always that warmth and chemistry. There was a deep mutual respect that gave our combined songwriting its unique power.”After more than 15 years away, Soft Cell again returned to recording in 2018 with two new songs, and released another album in 2022, Happiness Not Included, which reached No 7 in the UK album chart. It was followed in 2024 by Happiness Now Completed.Soft Cell: ‘One day you’re smearing your naked body with cat food, the next you’re at the garden centre’Read moreBall published his memoir Electronic Boy: My Life in and Out of Soft Cell in 2020. He sustained numerous fractures in a fall down some stairs in 2022, and subsequently contracted pneumonia and sepsis, spending seven months in hospital including time in an induced coma.Almond added that he and Ball had recently completed a new Soft Cell album entitled Danceteria, named after the fabled New York nightclub which they visited at the height of their fame.“Dave was in such a great place emotionally,” he said. “He was focused and so happy with the new album that we completed only a few days ago. It’s so sad as 2026 was all set to be such an uplifting year for him, and I take some solace from the fact that he heard the finished record and felt that it was a great piece of work. Dave’s music is better than ever. His tunes and hooks are still unmistakably Soft Cell, yet he always took it to the next level, too.”Also paying tribute was Daniel Miller, founder of Mute records and a music producer, who worked with Soft Cell in their early years. “I was extremely impressed with Dave’s vision and his musicality … We have lost a true original,” he said.Explore more on these topicsDave BallElectronic musicPop and rockMarc AlmondnewsShareReuse this content"

Oprah Winfrey and Debbie Allen were among those who gave speeches of praise.Winfrey spoke of the power of young people of color seeing Copeland lead iconic ballets like Swan Lake.“Misty didn’t just perform ballet,” Winfrey said of the ballerina who has achieved a unique crossover fame. “She changed it. She redefined who belongs, who gets to be seen, and who gets to lead.”In a way, the gala was both a return and a departure for Copeland, 43. She was dancing with the company for the first time in five years. During that time, Copeland has been raising a son, Jackson, with her husband. The three-year-old came onstage to hug his mother during curtain calls, wearing a tuxedo.View image in fullscreenMisty Copeland and Oprah Winfrey.Photograph: Guerin Charles/ABACA/ShutterstockCopeland has also been continuing her career as an author – the second volume of her Bunheads series appeared in September – and working to increase diversity in the dance world with her namesake foundation, including Be Bold, an afterschool program designed for young children of color.But she decided to dust off the pointe shoes so she could have one last spin on the ABT stage – including as Juliet, one of the most passionate roles in ballet and her personal favorite. Copeland’s Romeo in the balcony pas de deux was Calvin Royal III, who in 2020 became ABT’s first Black male principal dancer in two decades.The duo later reappeared for another duet, this time a modern one, in Wrecka Stow, by Kyle Abraham. For Copeland’s final performance of the night, she performed Twyla Tharp’s Sinatra Suite with another of her favorite partners, Herman Cornejo.The night, which also celebrated ABT’s 85th anniversary and was curated in large part by Copeland herself, included speeches and film clips about her career. And her fellow dancers performed excerpts of ballets in her honor.At the end, a beaming Copeland was given a quintessential ballet farewell, as colleagues, teachers, friends and family came out to greet her, one by one, with hugs and bouquets while glittery confetti poured from the rafters.View image in fullscreenCopeland, center, takes a bow during curtain calls at her retirement performance at the David H Koch Theater at Lincoln Center in New York City.Photograph: Rosalie O’Connor/APOn the carpet Wednesday before her performance, she said: “I feel good. I feel ready to take this next step.” She noted that she would be continuing her work promoting diversity: “There’s so much work and effort that has to be continuous.”The evening at Lincoln Center’s David H Koch Theater was streamed live to nearby Alice Tully Hall across the plaza, with attendance free to the public – another sign of Copeland’s unique brand of fame in the dance world.Copeland was born in Kansas City, Missouri, and raised in San Pedro, California, where she lived in near poverty and through periods of homelessness as her single mother struggled to support her and five siblings.For a future professional dancer, she came to ballet relatively late – at 13 – but soon excelled and went on to study at the San Francisco Ballet School and ABT on scholarship opportunities. After a stint in the junior company, Copeland joined ABT as a member of the corps de ballet in April 2001, becoming a soloist six years later. In June 2015, Copeland was promoted to principal dancer.Explore more on these topicsBalletNew YorkDancenewsShareReuse this content"

She played the zither, a stringed instrument with its origins in Austria and Bavaria, and her repertoire included folk songs not only from her native Australia but also from France, Italy, Ireland, the US and Asia. A great storyteller, she became a regular fixture on British TV variety shows and children’s programmes.She arrived almost penniless in London from Australia in 1952 – after stops in Singapore and Karachi to play at nightclubs to pay for her onward journey – and her career took off almost instantly. A newspaper photo of Abicair arriving at Heathrow was seen by a BBC radio producer looking for Commonwealth artists to appear in a radio programme. The band leader Geraldo heard her and booked her for a concert and a further audition, after which she appeared for the first time on the BBC TV programme The Centre Show, on 20 January 1953. Within a few weeks she had her own series with her zither and “a rhythm quartet”, and later that year released her first 78rpm single, an orchestra-and-zither treatment of Careless Love, once recorded by Bessie Smith.View image in fullscreenAbicair with Norman Wisdom in One Good Turn, 1955, directed by John Paddy Carstairs.Photograph: Photo 12/AlamyShe went on to appear alongsideNorman Wisdomin the film One Good Turn (1955) and in the same year made the first of her appearances on the children’s TV show Crackerjack. Her skills as a children’s entertainer were further demonstrated by her appearances on the TV programmes Studio E and Children’s Hour, which she hosted with her puppet “friends”, Tea Cup and Clothespeg. The BBC request programme Children’s Favourites regularly featured her recording ofLittle Boy Fishin’(1956), written by the Australian Bill Lovelock.Abicair was Roy Plomley’s castawayon Desert Island Discsin 1956, and chose music by Bach, Fats Waller andBurl Ives, and, for her luxury item, a “case of avocado pears”.She was an established light entertainment star, but complained that scripts for some programmes were “as monotonous as if tape-recorded by a parrot”. Arguing that “to be a good performer you must have good material to perform”, she worked with the producerGeorge Martin, of Beatles fame, on thetheme songfor the 1956 film Smiley, set in a small country town in Australia, and praised Martin’s “warm, silent understanding and musicianship”.She also worked with Lovelock to collect what she called “some of the most beautiful folk songs in the world” for her solo albums. It’s Shirley! (1958) included the English traditionalGreen Willow, which Steeleye Span later recorded as their hit All Around My Hat. The follow-up album Look! It’s Shirley (1959) included Willie the Weeper, a song recorded by Louis Armstrong and now arranged byHumphrey Lyttelton. A Delicate Air (1960) included Walzing Matilda and Spanish Is a Loving Tongue, a song written in the 1920s that became a Bob Dylan favourite.Abicair’s albums pointed to eclectic musical taste, and in 1957 she appeared on the BBC’s first rock-era programme Six-Five Special, alongside Lyttelton and the Vipers skiffle group.In the 60s she travelled extensively, touring Russia and the US, and entertaining British troops in the far east with the comedian Frankie Howerd. But she continued to work in children’s entertainment, and published a collection of children’s stories about an Indigenous Australian boy, The Tales of Tumbarumba, in 1962. Her final singles included covers of Paul Simon’sFlowers Never Bend With the Rainfall(1966) and the Beatles’This Girl(1967).View image in fullscreenAbicair with the astronaut Yuri Gagarin in Moscow, 1962.Photograph: Smith Archive/AlamyIn the 70s, in a move that would have surprised those who remembered her as a family entertainer, she toured the US college circuit with the counterculture writerKen Kesey(the author of One Flew Over The Cuckoo’s Nest, known for his drug-induced adventures with the Merry Pranksters), and lived on his farm in Oregon.In the punk era, she was name-checked byIan Duryin his 1981 songCommon As Muck, as one of those – along with Brigitte Bardot, Lionel Blair and Victor Hugo – who don’t come into this category.Born in Melbourne, Shirley grew up in Adelaide, South Australia, the daughter of an RAAF wing commander and a music-loving mother. Her musical career started when she discovered a zither while looking through the attic of her parent’s home, and taught herself to play. At Sydney University, where she studied philosophy, she supported herself by working as a typist. At night she would sing to friends, and after winning a radio contest she began to sing professionally.She was followed to Britain in 1952 by her then boyfriend,Murray Sayle, whom she had known since her university days. Both of their careers flourished in the UK – Sayle became a celebrated war reporter and adventurer – but their relationship was less successful.She spent her final years living in London.Shirley Abicair, musician, writer and entertainer, born 25 October 1928; died 27 September 2025Explore more on these topicsFolk musicChildren's TVTelevisionChildren and teenagersShareReuse this content"

Her pregnancy, however, brought a level of body acceptance and contentment that the 33-year-old from Wales had never had before.But as her due date approached, a familiar feeling of dread emerged. In her antenatal class WhatsApp group – once a space where pictures of their growing bumps and tips on how to get labour started were shared – babies started arriving and so did conversations about feeding. Suddenly, diet and weight loss entered the chat. Out of the group of six mums, three decided not to breastfeed or gave up early to either crash diet or go on weight-loss jabs – both of which are advised against during breastfeeding due to their impact on both milk quality and supply. Lydia was committed to breastfeeding, though, so tried not to let it faze her – and was relieved when, despite her son being very poorly when he was born and ending up in the neonatal intensive care unit, they were able to do it.Trauma has a habit of focusing the mind, and in the early days of her son’s life, Lydia’s worries about her weight fell by the wayside as she devoted herself to caring for him. “He nearly died. I just didn’t care about anything else other than him,” she says. After a few months, though, she started to notice that her weight had begun to creep up, rather than fall off, as everyone – including her mum – had assured her it would while she was feeding.Today, at seven months postpartum, everywhere she looks, she sees weight-loss jabs: in her Instagram feed, many of her followers are either on them or talking about them – and many targeted ads are from a private provider. The world, it seems, is ready for her to stop being overweight. And like so many women before her, she is listening. “As much as I can appreciate my body for bringing this beautiful soul into the world and I can completely rationalise it,” she says, “the thought of not being ‘thin’ for my wedding makes me want to die inside.”I am also a mother to young children and, like many others, have struggled with my weight throughout my life. I grew up in the late 90s, under the toxic lens of obsessive scrutiny of women’s bodies. I still remember presenter Chris Evans asking Victoria Beckham to weigh herself live on TV six months after giving birth to her first son, Brooklyn, to prove that she had lost her baby weight. And although the body positivity years made great strides in helping us all to embrace difference and diversity, the rapid multi-billion-pound growth of the GLP-1 agonist market, which has seen an estimated 1.5 million people in the UK start using the drugs, seems to be pushing acceptance backwards.I had my first child in 2022 and my second in 2024 – and the pressure to “snap back” after my second was acute; the entire landscape felt different. Weight loss was now not simply aspirational, but possible; just one simple, albeit pretty expensive, injection away. A2019 studyby the Mental Health Foundation estimated that as many as four in 10 women experience postnatal body dissatisfaction – it’s no wonder private weight-loss companies target women who have recently given birth. Just look to Serena Williams’s recent endorsement of the jabs as part of anadvertising campaignfor Ro, a private provider: “After kids, it’s the medicine my body needed,” she says.I jumped on the bandwagon six months after giving birth. After researching the drugs and reading thegovernment and NHS guidancearound taking GLP-1 agonists, I learned that these drugs should not be taken during pregnancy, while trying to get pregnant, or while breastfeeding. In close second to the numerous bouts of mastitis I suffered in the preceding few months, wanting to quickly lose weight was a huge factor in my decision to give up breastfeeding at six months.View image in fullscreen‘Looking back now, I can see how exposed and insecure I was in those early postnatal days.’Illustration: Kika Klat/The GuardianDr Jan Toledano, a leading women’s hormone specialist and founder of theLondon Hormone Clinic, says she sees this all too often in her clinic. “It’s such a period of hormonal upheaval. Your body changes, you’re all over the place ... you’ve got the responsibility of looking after these new babies and toddlers. You have all sorts of identity and body issues, and the pressure to go back to how you were before is immense.” She says it is alarming, but not surprising, that someone would be so keen to lose weight in this environment that they’re prepared to stop breastfeeding.Melanie* is a 31-year-old mum of two small children and lives in south Wales. Her youngest daughter is 18 months old and breastfeeds a few times a day. Fed up with her size postnatally and keen to lose weight, Melanie has been injecting Mounjaro (a popular GLP-1 agonist) since January and has lost five stone. For her, the weight loss has been “life-changing”, although going against NHS guidance wasn’t a decision she took lightly. “I did a lot of research, read science papers as much as I could understand them and spoke to my husband about it,” she says. The private provider she bought her Mounjaro from asked if she was breastfeeding. She ticked a box to say no and the veracity of the information she provided was never checked.She says she felt more comfortable going against strict guidance as she takes another medication she says is administered in the same way that is deemed safe for breastfeeding. She had also read experiences of other women on Reddit. “Obviously, they haven’t been able to do large-scale studies on the safety of the drugs while breastfeeding, because it’s not ethical,” she explains, “but we decided that we would go ahead.”It’s extremely important that GLP-1s are avoided during breastfeedingThe Breastfeeding Network’sDrugs in Breastmilkservice provides information on the safety of medications, treatments and procedures when breastfeeding. Amanda Da Costa, clinical supervisor at the service, says that the number of enquiries from breastfeeding mothers about weight loss has gone up 145% from summer 2024 to summer 2025. “Questions about jabs make up the largest reason for those weight-loss-related queries,” she says. “GLP-1 medications such as Mounjaro, Ozempic or Wegovy are not recommended for use while breastfeeding,” she adds. “More research and data is needed on whether these drugs transfer into breastmilk or whether they have any effect on nursing infants.”Toledano is even more direct in her concern about use of these drugs during breastfeeding. “There’s very little human data on whether they are absorbed in breast milk and passed onto a baby, but there are animal studies,” she says. “They’re not very extensive, but there are some that show that there could be a possible effect on the growth of the baby – so it’s both extremely serious and extremely important that GLP-1s are avoided during breastfeeding.” She also points out that the impact on a baby might not even be visible at first, but there is the potential for long-term consequences. “Other areas of concern for the baby would include development of normal appetite regulation and gut hormone pathways.”The fact that new parents like Melanie can access these drugs online so easily is concerning. Da Costa says the network expects all prescribers to ask patients whether they are breastfeeding before prescribing, but is quick to say that they know this doesn’t always happen, or that a person may choose not to or forget to disclose this information. For Toledano this lack of oversight is the most troubling aspect of the boom in GLP-1 use via private vendors. “They often advertise that there is nutritional support, but there isn’t,” she says, “and because it’s online and no one can get their eyes on you, how do you make an assessment of how well the patient is?”View image in fullscreenRapid weight loss can harm milk production.Photograph: Galina Zhigalova/Getty ImagesToledano says there are other potential health risks of taking weight-loss drugs during the postnatal period – which she determines as at least the first year of a baby’s life. “If there’s rapid weight loss, this impacts lots of different things: milk production may cease, yes, but also energy levels may decrease, which, in my opinion, would predispose to postnatal depression.” She also notes that losing body mass quickly can lead to a cessation of periods, which could mask the return to fertility that menstruation often indicates. Because of this, she advises anyone taking them to be really careful about contraception if their intention is not to fall pregnant.There are, of course, some cases in which mothers need medical assistance in the postnatal period, specifically if they have developed gestational diabetes or are at risk of developing type 2 diabetes or other metabolic diseases. In these cases, Toledano advises working with a specialist doctor who can oversee their care as they take the drugs, but she is concerned that the mass marketing of the drugs directly to consumers is interfering with this process. “If a woman is reaching for the GLP-1 agonists because they’re advertised all the time and everyone’s on them, she’s not going to see a doctor who understands metabolic changes after pregnancy,” which, she believes, puts them at risk of developing unwanted side effects or other health complications.I regret my decision to stop breastfeeding to take GLP-1 agonists — not least because the side effects were intolerable for me, and I was unable to take them for longer than a couple of weeks. Letting your milk supply go isn’t a decision that you can easily go back on. Hindsight is a beautiful thing, of course, but looking back now, I can see how exposed and insecure I was in those early postnatal days, and therefore primed to fall for the promise of easy weight loss. I may as well have had a target painted on my back. And what I do feel now is worry about the lack of continuous care and support for postnatal women who are – rightly or wrongly – being pushed towards these drugs during an extremely susceptible time. I wish someone had protected me from them.Since our interview, Melanie has told me that she has now stopped taking Mounjaro. She says she is concerned by how easy it is for postnatal women like her to get drawn in by the marketing of the jabs, or to omit information or lie to get hold of them – as she did. “You are quite vulnerable; your hormones are all over the place, lack of sleep and all of that. There should be warnings and stricter advertising so they don’t target the wrong people,” she says.For now, Lydia has decided not to take the drugs. “Ultimately, my child comes before this incessant need to be thin,” she says, although she is clear that if she is advised it is safe to do so, and she’s confident her son won’t be harmed, she is likely to take them as soon as he turns one. She also resents that, as is often the fate of women, she is having to choose between two things that society places huge pressure on mothers to achieve: bouncing back and breastfeeding. “I just hate that I can’t do both,” she says. I tell her I feel the same.* Names have been changedExplore more on these topicsPregnancyHealthHealth & wellbeingParents and parentingDrugsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Instead, they got sickCommon compounds like turmeric and ashwagandha can overwhelm the liver and lead to health complicationsAdrienne MateiThu 23 Oct 2025 12.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 23 Oct 2025 13.52 EDTShareFernanda Thompson was a healthy 40-year-old when she began taking turmeric in 2020. Online, people were saying the pungent yellow spice could make everyone a little bit healthier. So she began putting half a teaspoon, about 2.5 grams, into her morning smoothie, hoping to reap the benefits of curcumin, the compound responsible for turmeric’s anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer, anti-oxidant halo.“It was Covid time,” says the Florida resident, who is a stay-at-home mom, and she wanted to boost her immunity. “I was healthy. And then I guess I tried to be healthier,” she says.In 2021, a routine blood test revealed Thompson’s white blood cell count was oddly low. She was referred to a hematologist and an ultrasound showed an enlarged liver.Thompson felt physically fine, but began monitoring her health more closely with both her doctor and a hematologist, getting regular blood tests that showed consistently low white blood cells. She feared with every follow-up that her doctors would make a serious diagnosis, like leukemia.Ozempic didn’t work for me. I was furious – and ashamedRead moreIn 2024, after three years of health anxiety, Thompson came across a blogpost by gynecologist Dr Jen Gunter titled “The Trouble with Turmeric”. In it, Gunter challenges the popular belief that turmeric is a completely safe, natural panacea. She points out that some of the most frequently quoted data on turmeric’s benefits are derived from discredited and low-quality studies. When you take turmeric, you are “paying to play the liver injury lotto with no quality data to prove that the product can help you meaningfully”, Gunter writes, citing research showing that to some people, turmeric can be toxic to macrophages, a type of white blood cell, and may contribute to iron deficiency.Attributions of causality between blood abnormalities or organ damage and supplements or natural medicines arenotoriously difficultfor general practitioners to provide, due to factors including thevariable compositionof supplements and their lack of research and regulation. However, there is data linking turmeric to liver injury – as of 2022, at least10 casesin the US and18in Australia, including one fatality.Thompson immediately stopped taking turmeric.“Six months later I did my blood test again and my white blood cell count was normal,” says Thompson, who ended up paying $1,275 out of pocket for her tests. Her doctor said they would never know if the cause was turmeric or something else, Thompson remembers, “‘but don’t take it again’”.Herbal supplements can contain compounds that overwhelm the liver’s normal detoxification, immune and metabolic functions. To experts who have dedicated their careers to studying herbal supplements’ effects on the liver, Thompson’s story is a familiar one – though cases of suspected toxicity from these substances don’t always end so well.“It’s more common now to see some severe cases of liver injury end up in the hospital, or even some that need to be addressed with a liver transplant,” due to patients taking herbal supplements, says Dr Alisa Likhitsup, a gastroenterology and transplant hepatologist at the University of Michigan, which operates a leading liver research center.Supplement-related liver injury is not necessarily tied to product dosage or contamination, though both can be contributing factors in liver injury and require further research, says Dr Robert Fontana, a leading global authority on drug-induced liver disease and professor of medicine at the University of Michigan. (For instance, herbal medicines have awell-documentedproblem with heavy metal contamination.) Yet, purity and quality aside, the herbal compounds themselves can cause issues. These effects can occur even with a small dose of a supplement, though higher doses can elevate the severity and speed of a bad reaction.The mentality of relying on supplements to achieve a better and longer life is unscientificDr Qianzhi JiangAnd it goes beyond turmeric. In 2024, Likhitsup’s research estimated that15.6 millionAmericans take compounds known to be potentially toxic to the liver on a daily basis, some of the most common being turmeric, ashwagandha and green tea extract. In 2023, the Council for Responsible Nutrition estimated that74%of Americans take dietary supplements. Supplements with the highest volume of advertising, increasingly bywellness influencers online, end up most popular, and most studied, Likhitsup says.But “there’s something like 100,000 herbal and dietary supplements out there”, says Fontana. “Most of them don’t cause harm that we know of … but none of these things are tested or validated or regulated,” he says. “I don’t see that the current administration is interested in more regulations, either.”Fontana has been studying herbal toxicity since 2004, when he founded the multi-institutionalDrug-Induced Liver Injury Network (DILIN), an NIH-funded research network that studies liver injuries caused by medications and supplements through nationwide patient registries of more than 3,000 people. Doctors refer patients with apparent drug-induced liver injury to Fontana and DILIN, who carefully assess cases to rule out other possible causes such as hereditary liver disease, antibiotics or other medications known to affect liver function, like acetaminophen.“When we look at it over time, the proportion of cases [of liver injury] attributed to herbal and dietary supplements is definitely going up,” says Fontana. Herbal supplements are a factor in20% of the casesDILIN, with some research suggesting that numbercould be as high as 43%. A 2022studyfound that, over the last 25 years in the United States, cases of drug-induced liver failure requiring waitlisting for liver transplantation due to herbal dietary supplements have increased eightfold.Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’Only a small fraction of those who take supplements experience liver issues as a result – there are no concrete numbers, but one in several thousand is “a best guess”, according to Dr Marwan Ghabril, a professor and hepatologist at the Indiana University School of Medicine, and lead author of the study. But among those, about 10% go through “worst-case scenario” outcomes, meaning they need a life-saving liver transplant or die.Herbal supplements are only becoming more popular, reflecting trends like health consciousness and theperceived safety of natural products compared with pharmaceuticals. Marketresearchestimates dietary supplements were a $74.3bn global industry in 2024, expected to reach $170bn by 2034. “When you magnify [herbal supplement use] up by the whole US population, it’s quite alarming,” says Fontana.“You should always consult a doctor before taking supplements,” says Dr Qianzhi Jiang, a registered dietitian based near Boston. Most supplements are unnecessary; proper nutrition is best achieved through diet, with exceptions for people who are pregnant or have vitamin deficiencies and require specific supplementation.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWell ActuallyFree weekly newsletterPractical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good lifeEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It seems that when you take a herbal supplement, you’re playing Russian roulette with your genetic ability to tolerate it, he says.“We do find unique genetic susceptibility factors among people who get liver injury,” says Fontana. Depending on their genetic makeup, someone may tolerate green tea extract without issue, but even a small amount of turmeric could trigger harm, and vice versa. The risks vary from person to person.In mild cases of herbal supplement-related toxicity, people “may not necessarily register” that anything is affecting their health, notes Ghabril. But in more problematic cases, abdominal pain, fevers, fatigue and jaundice can result. Nausea and itching may also be a problem if the person’s bile acids become elevated, he says.In severe cases of injury, symptoms can quickly escalate. Earlier this year, twounrelatedcases– Robert Grafton and Katie Mohan, both New Jersey residents in their 50s – were hospitalized with drug-induced liver injury linked to turmeric supplements, drawing increased attention to potential harm.Naveen Kathuria, 46, a former lawyer and health tech CEO based in New York City, had no known health issues when he began taking daily 150mg ashwagandha supplements purchased from Amazonin June 2024.Kathuria was influenced by what he calls a “subculture of optimization and longevity” in the tech industry; he was hoping the pills would help him with “sleep, stress, and workouts”.Meta-analysesshow ashwagandha may be beneficial for reducing stress, though higher-quality studies are scarce.Experts say we need to eat 30 plants a week. This is how I faredRead moreBy September, Kathuria began to feel uncharacteristically lethargic. A blood test showed his liver enzymes were so elevated that his doctor ordered a repeat test to rule out error. He stopped taking the supplements immediately, but by the end of the month he was jaundiced, rapidly losing weight, vomiting, itching and unable to sleep. His doctor – who Kathuria says was weighing plasma transfusions and a liver biopsy – advised against travel, but Kathuria chose to return to Michigan to be with family who could help care for him.There, he connected with Fontana, who confirmed the severity of his condition. “There’s very few physicians out there that are well-educated on drug-induced liver injury and the harmful impact of supplements,” says Kathuria.Fontana recommended time, rest and no further supplements, rather than invasive procedures. Kathuria says he has since made a “full recovery” and returned to work.Both Kathuria and Thompson emerged from their health scares wishing more people knew that herbal supplements, however benign they seem, can carry substantial risks. “The fact that it’s a plant doesn’t mean it’s effective or safe,” Thompson says.Kathuria says he has always been careful about the food he eats. “But I never really thought through how supplements can impact your body,” he says. He doesn’t take supplements any more.Explore more on these topicsWell actuallyNutritionDiets and dietingHealth & wellbeingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It has insulating properties, is moisture-wicking and breathable and completely biodegradable. It’s also the most recycled clothing fibre in the world, according toWoolmark, and can be recycled into “new” wool by mechanically shredding and respinning the fibres, or “unknitting” garments and using the wool again (seeRoveandiinouiiofor details).The Guardian’s journalism is independent.

I caught up with experts to find out the best ways to clean and care for your knitwear, so you can keep your roll necks, cardis and cable knits looking beautiful and in use for as many years as possible.How to look after your knitwearTo wash, or not to wash?View image in fullscreenWash as little as possible to avoid shrinkage disasters.Photograph: susandaniels/Getty Images/iStockphotoWe’ve all shrunk a favourite wool jumper in the wash, so what if the answer was not to wash your knitwear at all? “It just needs a rest in between wears,” says knitwear designerGenevieve Sweeney. “Hanging it outside on a fresh day does it such good and springs it back to life.” Ruth Alice Rands, founder of British knitwear companyHerd, agrees: “For knitwear containing any kind of wool, it’s best to wash as little as possible. Wool is naturally rich in lanolin, which means it shrugs off odours and spills, so often an airing will restore it to condition.”Replace washing with steamingThe British weather doesn’t always allow for hanging your knitwear outside to refresh it, which is where a hand steamer comes into play. “Steaming is a great tool in the maintenance of knitwear and works well for refreshing and returning a garment to shape,” says Rands. “Be sure to always let it dry flat after steaming as per washing.”“Every wash, no matter how gentle, stresses the fibres,” adds Frej Lewenhaupt, co-founder at clothing care brandSteamery. “Steaming, on the other hand, refreshes the garment instantly. It smooths out creases, removes odours, kills bacteria, and brings the fibres back to life.”Can you ‘unshrink’ knitwear?While it is possible to stretch a shrunken knit, the results will depend on how much it has shrunk – it will probably never be quite the same again. “If it’s a little tight or slightly felted, giving the sweater a good steam, to get the fibres relaxed, then giving it a gentle stretch can fix it,” says Sweeney.For bigger disasters, try soaking it in a bath of baby shampoo before pressing out the water and laying it flat on a towel. “Stretch the knit, pulling down lengthways, then across the width,” she says. “You want to relax the fibres again, so avoid heat and let it air dry. Once dry, give it another good steam and stretch.”How to remove stains …View image in fullscreenOnly ever hand-wash with a gentle detergent.Photograph: Evgeniy Skripnichenko/Getty ImagesIf your jumper is stained or really dirty, it may be necessary to wash it. In this case, technique is key. “Spot cleaning with a wool detergent will – almost magically – remove most marks,” says Rands. “If washing is unavoidable, always hand-wash using a gentle detergent and do not agitate it too much. Essentially, heat plus movement equals felting/shrinkage, so move it around in the basin as little as possible and never wring it out.”Sweeney’s technique involves a once-a-year soak. “Run cool water into the bath – I find even lukewarm water can shrink some wools. Add a little wool wash (or hair shampoo if you don’t have any) and stir it around the water until it has dissolved. Place the knitwear into the bath, ensuring it’s completely covered in water. Gently rub a spot of wool wash into any dirty spots. Leave it for half an hour, then rinse out.”… and how to dryNever wring out your wet knitwear. Instead, give it a gentle squeeze before laying it on a towel as flat as possible, on a horizontal hanging rail if you have one. Never – repeat never – put your knitwear in the tumble dryer.Moths offView image in fullscreenGive your knitwear the freezer treatment to banish moths.Photograph: Jeffrey Coolidge/Getty ImagesPrevention is key, but what actually works to keep moths at bay? Sweeney takes a natural approach with lavender, bay leaves, rosemary and cedar wood shavings. Rands, however, takes no prisoners. “Absolutely foolproof is storing knitwear in airtight boxes (the ones with clips on the side are perfect) and placing [items] in a freezer bag in the freezer for a week at a time over the summer. This removes any chance of any moths surviving.“The usual cycle for moths is to lay in the spring, and it’s actually when the eggs hatch that they cause the damage, so I cycle my knitwear once through the freezer in the summer (not spring).”Failing that, the simple act of wearing all your knitwear regularly can help, she says. “Moths don’t like light. Knitwear stored in dark places for extended periods of time is appealing to moths, so ideally it would be regularly worn or given the freezer treatment in the summer to ensure the eggs never hatch.”The best way to debobbleWell-loved knitwear can start to bobble, especially in areas that rub, such as under the arms. Removing bobbles can freshen up the item, but it’s important to debobble your knitwear carefully. Sweeney usesa cedarwood combevery few months, while Rands gently pulls the bobbles off as and when they appear.“There is no fixed rule for how often, it depends entirely on how frequently and actively the garment is worn,” says Lewenhaupt. “Some knits might need a quick touch-up every few wears, others only occasionally.”Embrace visible mendingView image in fullscreenDarn it! Patches and embroidery can breathe new life into damaged knitwear.Photograph: Kathrin Ziegler/Getty ImagesCreatively and visibly mending knitwear has become increasingly popular as we better understand the value of the fabrics, fibres and clothing we wear, and there are services all over the country that can repair your knitwear. “One of my favourites was a customer who repaired his Vivienne Westwood jumper that was full of moth holes,” says Daisy Harvey, founder of theLoom app, which connects people with skilled creatives who can fix their worn-out items. “He collaborated with an embroiderer on a falling-leaves design. It completely transformed the piece into something even more special.”For larger holes on areas such as elbows, consider patches, and when your woollen jumper has finally gone beyond the point of salvation, check that it’s a 100% natural fibre, and if so,cut it up and add it to the compost.For more ideas to help your favourite items last longer:From beeswax to baby wipes: how to make your leather last a lifetime‘Glass chopping boards should be illegal’: how to look after your kitchen knivesFrom cloths to cleaning tablets: how to make your coffee machine last longerHannah Rochell is a fashion features journalist who specialises in writing about – and experiencing – slow, comfortable style and living on her SubstackSlowette.

Here, we’ll get to the bottom of the strengths and weaknesses of all of the best e-readers, including Kindle rivals from Kobo, Onyx Boox and others.It’s time to pull yourself away from the hellscape of social media – settle down with a calming apocalypse fiction ebook instead.‘They make me want to walk more’: 14 everyday items that could improve your lifeRead moreAt a glanceBest e-reader overall:Kindle Paperwhite£159.99 at AmazonBest colour e-reader:Kobo Libra Colour£209 at CurrysBest affordable e-reader:Kobo Clara BW£129.99 at ArgosBest phone-style e-reader:Onyx Boox Palma 2£249.99 at AmazonBest e-reader for kids:Kindle for Kids£114.99 at ArgosWhy you should trust meI have read books primarily on an e-reader since I bought the first mainstream model launched in the UK, Sony’s PRS-505 from 2007.I’ve reviewed them professionally since 2013, for several websites and magazines. And I’ve had the chance to watch the fall of Sony as the biggest Amazon Kindle rival, followed by the rise of Kobo and Onyx Boox since.I’ve also had a chance to see many years’ worth of trade-show demos of the current top e-reader trend: colour E Ink. My, have colour readers taken a long time to arrive.How I testedView image in fullscreenChoosing the best e-reader comes down to how they feel when they’re being used.Photograph: Andrew Williams/The GuardianThere is no effective benchmark for e-readers. Measuring the brightness of the screens doesn’t tell you much. You can test the power of their computing brains, but that says little about how they feel to use.While I’ve performed those empirical tests on 13 devices for this article, choosing the best e-reader is much more about how they feel to use in everyday life. You don’t truly know one until you’ve been jolted awake after dropping it on your face half a dozen times, having nodded off while reading in bed.Rigorous real-world testing involves multiple sessions of reading in the bath, using them on public transport and reading under library strip lighting to check out screen glare. Just as important, I also used each e-reader’s bookstore. It’s important to question not only how good the book selection is, but also how good its discovery tools are and how easy it is to buy a book, or try samples.I had to look beyond novels and PDFs on some readers, too. Do the colour displays actually make comics, graphic novels and magazines look good, and are the pages easy to navigate? I also made notes on the readers that support note-taking with a stylus to find out how easy that is.Inevitably, a few elements come down to pure preference. For example, whether you prefer turning the page with a button or a touchscreen is simply a matter of taste. But in a category where the experience is everything, this one had to be judged by my real-world use.Here’s my guide to the 10 best e-readers from my testing.The best e-readers in 2025View image in fullscreen‘The best bet for many younger readers’: the Kindle for Kids.Photograph: Andrew Williams/The GuardianBest e-reader overall:Kindle PaperwhiteView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Andrew Williams/The Guardian£159.99 at Amazon£159.99 at John LewisThe Paperwhite was originally released to show off Amazon’s lit E Ink screen tech in 2012. Since then, it has settled in to become Amazon’s easiest-to-recommend e-reader for most people.It’s a mature series that doesn’t suffer the first-generation teething problems that the colour-screenKindle Colorsoftdid, and it costs a whole lot less, too. This is the embodiment of the idea that an e-reader should be a gadget with a single job.Why we love itThis generation of Paperwhite fits a larger 7in screen into a smaller casing than last time around. The display can comfortably cram more words on to each page and contributes to what is a great-looking design.The entirely flat edge-to-edge screen surface eliminates screen shadows. Curved corners make it seem more friendly and the soft-touch back feels great, while the water resistance offers bath-time insurance.A Paperwhite is also a beautiful canvas for novels. Its surface is much purer and cleaner than a spotlight-stealing Kindle Colorsoft, and performance has been massively improved in this generation, speeding up those evenings searching for a new read on the Kindle Store.Is it easy to repair?Amazon doesn’t use glue to hold the Paperwhite together, despite its solid IPX8 water resistance. You can pry the e-reader apart with a plastic pry tool or guitar pick to reveal the battery and a ribbon cable that attaches it to the main board. Amazon doesn’t sell spares for this unit, however, and I was only able to find spares and replacement batteries for the previous Kindle Paperwhite from 2021. So overall, no.It’s a shame that …there’s no Kindle with physical buttons for sale after the Kindle Oasis was discontinued in 2024. It’s not necessarily the Paperwhite’s job to fill that gap, but it is a reason to consider a non-Kindle rival instead. There are also a few features only found in the pricierSignature Edition: wireless charging, automatic screen brightness and larger storage options.Display:7in monochrome E InkStorage size:16/32GBDimensions:127.5 x 176.7 x 7.8mmWeight:211gBest colour e-reader:Kobo Libra ColourView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Andrew Williams/The Guardian£209 at Currys£209.99 at ArgosThe Libra Colour is Kobo’s larger colour-screen e-reader, with a 7in display and an E Ink Kaleido 3 panel.Among the main pluses here is its significantly lower price compared with other colour-screen rivals, the Amazon Kindle Colorsoft and the Onyx Boox Go Color 7.Why we love itComfy page-turn buttons may not be among the Libra Colour’s star features, but they will make some fall in love with this e-reader. It’s not just that page turns now require next to zero movement: the slight curvature of the casing also hugs your thumb for better ergonomics. It’s lovely.Kobo finely balances features and complexity in the Libra Colour. It supports note-taking and integrates with Google Drive and Dropbox, but still retains that all-important simplicity.As one of the first wave of mainstream colour e-readers, it’s also suitable for a wider range of content than traditional devices.You can also borrow graphic novels from the library. But we have a tip if your local library uses theOverdriveplatform: try theLibby appinstead. It’s based on the same underlying tech but makes the process easier. Borrow a graphic novel in the Libby app on your phone, hit the sync button in the Discover tab on your Kobo and the borrowed content will appear in your library. This avoids the need to use Adobe’s finicky Digital Editions software.Is it easy to repair?You can take a Kobo Libra Colour apart without expensive or specialist tools. The back cover is held on with clips, which can be released with a plastic pick. Even better, Kobo has officiallypartnered with iFixitto provideofficial spares, which is great. You can replace the battery, the screen and even the motherboard.It earns theLibra Colour a decent 6/10 repairability score from iFixit. Sounds low? This is fairly high for mainstream consumer tech, and there are compromises. Any significant repairs will spoil the waterproofing, which relies on a plastic coating over the internal components.It’s a shame that …as with all current colour e-readers, the page surface looks much greyer and less clean than on the best monochrome readers. When turning the page on colour content, the onscreen refreshes are slower and more ugly-looking. Adjust your expectations on the punchiness of the colour, too, because E Ink’s colour richness isn’t anything like that of an OLED screen.Display:7in colour E InkStorage:32GBDimensions:144.6 x 161 x 8.3mmWeight:199.5gBest affordable e-reader:Kobo Clara BWView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Andrew Williams/The Guardian£129 at Currys£129.99 at ArgosThe Clara BW is Kobo’s main rival to the standard Kindle. It’s a simple black-and-white e-reader, with a 6in screen and a frame narrow enough to fit in many a coat pocket.It combines a non-flashy, budget-conscious approach to design with an aggressive corralling of features – including some that Amazon holds back for its higher-end Paperwhite model.Why we love itAlthough you can tell from a glance that this e-reader is a more humble model, it’s remarkably feature-rich. The screen light can be much warmer-looking at night-time, to help avoid it affecting your sleep. It’s also IPX8 water resistant, to handle being dunked in 2m-deep water for up to an hour – so it’s bath-time reading approved.Now, I used e-readers in the bath long before they were water-resistant, and I’m not a huge fan of a super-warm-looking reader screen – but the Clara BW will win over even such picky people with its fantastic E Ink Carta 1300 display. The page surface is lighter than on older tech e-readers, providing better contrast. After-image ghosting is reduced and page turns are a little faster too. This all means you get an ultra-clean and clear reproduction of books, mining that ebook reader appeal all the more.While the Clara BW isn’t hugely cheap, it will save you money in the long run: it has OverDrive, a platform used in many UK libraries, built in. You can borrow ebooks for two weeks a piece without spending a penny.Is it easy to repair?Official spare Clara BW Parts areavailable through iFixit, and you don’t need any advanced tools. A light glue is used to keep the screen in place, but this can be loosened with a hairdryer. You may not consider a screen replacement worthwhile, though, since it’s not far off the cost of the entire device.Repairs will also spoil the water resistance, which relies on a main board coating you’ll likely have to pierce. Take care to check your battery too: Kobo upgraded the one in this model in April 2025. Newer models have theP365model number, while older ones areN365.It’s a shame that …Kobo’s take on OverDrive can be a headache, as only books available on the Kobo Store will appear when you search. To see the full library, you may need to use the OverDrive app on your phone.The Clara BW also lacks the note-taking stylus feature of the Libra family.Display:6in monochrome E InkStorage:16GBDimensions:112 x 160 x 9.2mmWeight:174gBest phone-style e-reader:Onyx Boox Palma 2View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Andrew Williams/The Guardian£249.99 at AmazonThe Onyx Palma 2 looks like a phone. It feels like a phone. And it can do almost everything a phone can – but it can’t take calls or send SMS messages because there’s no SIM slot.Still, the style’s ideal if you need to read one-handed – while wedged into a train carriage on the way to work, for example.Why we love itSimultaneously “out there” and obvious, the Palma 2 is an E Ink almost-phone that just lacks the ability to make calls. The Boox book store is onboard, but so is the Android Google Play app store.Any app or game you might use on an Android phone is only a few taps away, making the Palma 2 radically more versatile, and more powerful, than the average e-reader. Constantly need to read work emails and reports while travelling? Just install an email client.There’s even a 16MP camera on the back. While it won’t compete with the camera of a decent phone, it has an optical character recognition feature baked in, so you can digitise any document you take a picture of. It’s the Swiss army knife of e-readers.Is it easy to repair?There are no spares available for this device – even more reason to pick up a case and possibly a screen protector to keep it safe.It’s a shame that …all that versatility robs the Palma 2 of the simplicity so highly valued in an e-reader. To get the ideal experience, you have to switch between four different screen modes, depending on which app you’re using. Is it fast motion you want, or a clearer-looking image? And the recessed screen causes shadows, which become all the more obvious with a screen this small.At times, you wonder why Onyx didn’t go the whole way and just add a SIM slot. It already has a tray for a microSD card, after all.Display:6.13in monochrome E Ink screenStorage:128GBDimensions:159 × 80 × 8mmWeight:170gskip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe FilterFree weekly newsletterGet the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

The base Kindle for Kids seems to be the best bet for many younger readers.The core hardware is the same. For £20 more thanthe adults’ version of this entry-level Kindle, you’ll get a colourful case, an enhanced two-year guarantee and a six-month subscription to Amazon’s Kids+ service. This is a child-friendly books and games subscription that otherwise costs £4.99 a month, or £6.99 for non-Prime members. Altogether, the additions are worth more than the additional £20.Why we love itThe two-year worry-free guarantee may be the most appealing part of the package. The Kindle for Kids tagline is “if it breaks, we will replace it”. And while the small print doesn’t cover all eventualities, we’ve heard almost universally positive reports from customer service claims over the years.While the Kindle itself has the same innards as the non-kids version, the setup is geared towards use by a child. You can choose the child-friendly books from your collection that are then synced on to the device. Thanks to the included Kids+ subscription, there are more books they can download without needing to nag you to buy them.The lock screen adverts seen in other Kindles are left out of kids’ profiles, instead displaying a cartoony image. A handy portal allows parents to see how much of each book their child has read and when. Schedules and screen-time limits can be set, all through a connected phone app.Just as important as all of that, the Kindle for Kids is simply an excellent e-reader. The screen is clear, supported by a bright front light. And while not all that suitable for very young kids, it is easy to use.Is it easy to repair?Amazon doesn’t really want you to repair your Kindle. It doesn’t sell spares. And asiFixitfound when taking apart an earlier Kindle, the front uses double-sided adhesive tape as well as clips – and the battery is glued in place.It’s a shame that …Amazon’s Kindle for Kids guarantee has a fantastic reputation, but the terms and conditions don’t technically cover accidental damage – which is kinda the whole point. This does protect Amazon against abuse of the system, though.It’s also worth bearing in mind that this entry-level Kindle doesn’t have a screen light that can be adjusted to look warmer, and it lacks a waterproofing rating.Display:6in monochrome E InkStorage size:16GBDimensions:158.8 x 114.4 x 13.6mm with caseWeight:256g including cover (157g without)The best of the restView image in fullscreen‘It looks as cute as anything in Amazon’s matcha green finish’: the Kindle (2024).Photograph: Andrew Williams/The GuardianOnyx Boox Go Color 7View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Andrew Williams/The Guardian£249.99 at Amazon£299.99 at ZoroBest for:handling virtually any kind of contentA super-versatile colour e-reader that can do more than most. It has dedicated page-turn buttons and, since it runs Android apps, you can install all sorts of reader apps and bookstores.We found it needed a little too much tweaking to get the most out of it, though. The default power settings lead to infuriating boot-up waits and auto-rotate woes. The front light isn’t the most consistent, either.Still, the sheer breadth of possibilities will put it above the rival Kindle and Kobo models for some. It can even run Netflix and has built-in speakers. Is it ideal for movies, though? Absolutely not.Is it easy to repair?Some unofficial spares are available for Onyx’s older e-readers, but we couldn’t track down any for the Onyx Boox Go Color 7. Onyx offers paid repair services for products within three years of purchase, but your options will be limited after that.It didn’t make the final cut because …it requires interface tweaks that some buyers may not even find, and its front light isn’t as consistent as those of its rivals.Display:7in Kaleido 3 colour E Ink;storage:64GB;dimensions:156 x 137 x 6.4mm;Weight:195gKobo Elipsa 2EView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Andrew Williams/The Guardian£349.99 at Kobo£349.99 at AmazonBest for:note-taking, and for larger-format reads such as graphic novelsThis 10.3in tablet-size e-reader is one of the most affordable routes to a larger note-taking E Ink slate.

Its display light is actually much brighter than the Kindle Paperwhite’s. Surprising, right? It looks as cute as anything in Amazon’s matcha green finish and is much more coat-pocket-friendly than the pricier Kindles. This will be love at first sight for many.It’s very similar to the 2022 version, though, new colour aside. And for not much more money, Kobo’s Clara BW provides several meaningful extra features. That said, if you already have a healthy to-read pile on Kindle, it’s still a cracking e-reader.Is it easy to repair?Kindles aren’t designed for easy user repair. You can’t buy replacement batteries from Amazon, and we haven’t found a good third-party source for spares either. On Amazon’s portal for out-of-warranty repairs, the official advice for someone whose battery is no longer holding charge is “sorry, devices with this problem are not currently eligible; we are working to increase the problems eligible for repair”.It didn’t make the final cut because …while we love that matcha green, Kobo squeezed in more features at a comparable price.Display:6in monochrome E Ink;storage:16GB;dimensions:157.8 x 108.6 x 8mm;weight:158gTCL 50 ProView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Andrew Williams/The Guardian£265 at Currys£279.99 at ArgosBest for:acting like a phone 95% of the time, because it is oneTCL promises “ebook-like immersion” with this reader-friendly phone.

When you flick a switch on the side, it enters a monochrome low-distraction mode, one that’s a dead ringer for an e-reader interface.While a solid phone, you don’t really get the particular eye-balm-like benefits of E Ink tech here: it’s still a backlit phone.

In a superficial sense, that’s exactly what this is. The Colorsoft looks just like a Paperwhite, but displays colours (and allows you to make handy colour-coded highlights in documents and books). However, the Paperwhite is still better for plain old “black-and-white” books, so don’t assume the price difference is the only barrier to upgrading.It’s not notably heavier or thicker, and the software at its core is just the same. You have to pay more, of course, and this series gets quite pricey if you upgrade to the £269.99Signature Edition(which comes with wireless charging, double the storage and automatic screen brightness adjustment).Battery life is lower than that of the Paperwhite, at up to eight weeks, but it’s still far lower-maintenance than most of your other gadgets. IPX8 water resistance means it doesn’t need to be coddled too much either.A touch of colour brings the Kindle’s library to life, and the device retains all the classic easy-on-the-eyes character of the Kindle range. However, a Paperwhite will look cleaner and clearer outside on a sunny day, and some will also be disappointed by the limited colour vibrancy.One obvious use for a colour e-reader is comics and graphic novels. However, the Colorsoft’s 7in screen is too small for that; consider upgrading to the soon-to-be-releasedKindle Scribe Colorsoftif that’s what you’re after. Similarly sized rivals from Kobo and Onyx are more ambitious in their features – stylus support and proper note-taking are still the preserve of the Scribe series.Is it easy to repair?The Colorsoft is not designed to be user-repairable. While the rear of the casing isn’t glued in place, the battery is – as revealed by tech-torturing YouTuberJerryRigEverything.Amazon doesn’t sell replacement components or batteries, and we couldn’t find any third-party alternatives at the time of writing. These may appear in the future, but trying to user-repair a glued-in battery? We don’t recommend it. Amazon’s portal suggests an under-warranty repair for Kindles, with no follow-up support.It didn’t make the final cut because …while the Colorsoft is simple and friendly, it’s also rather limited. I wouldn’t recommend it over the Kobo Libra Colour at RRP – but it’s a different story during Amazon’s frequent sales events.Display:7in colour E Ink;storage:16/32GB;dimensions:127.6 x 176.7 x 7.8mm;weight:215gWhat you need to knowView image in fullscreenConsider waiting for the sales if you’re not in a desperate rush to buy an e-reader.Photograph: Andrew Williams/The GuardianHow much should you spend?Good e-readers start at about £100. The cheapest Kindle is just slightly below that; the most affordable Kobo is a little above.If you’re not in a desperate rush to get hold of an e-reader, consider waiting for one of the major sales periods. There are often excellent discounts during Black Friday, Prime Day and other similar discount events.What are the key factors to look for?Every e-reader these days has the one feature that levelled up the category most significantly since its inception: the front light. In the early days, you needed a decent amount of ambient light to use an e-reader; now they’re ideal for reading in the dark.One more recent addition is colour temperature control. Some readers can cut out blue light at night in an attempt to prevent it from disrupting your sleep. However, this does make the light appear orange, and some folks have no problem falling asleep while reading a more “cool” light e-reader anyway. You can trust us on that one.Should you buy a colour e-reader?Colour e-readers are hot stuff at the moment, but they come with compromises.First up, they’re more expensive than the monochrome kind. Their displays appear less clean and pure thanks to the way colour E Ink works, and the display refresh that’s needed on any E Ink device is far more jarring and noticeable.But perhaps the biggest problem with colour E Ink readers is that most of them are relatively small and, therefore, not best-suited to their number-one job – reading graphic novels and comics. The best e-readers for that task come from Amazon and Onyx Boox, which has produced larger tablet-style E Ink devices for a while. However, they’re expensive. The Kindle Scribe Colorsoft starts at an intimidating £569.99, while Onyx Boox charges upwards of €529.99 (about £460) for the latest models in the Tab and Note series. As such, they’re not all that easy to recommend for most people, despite being unusual, versatile and ambitious devices.Andrew Williams is aconsumer journalist who has written about technology since before the first iPhone came out.

The resulting product is not only rare, but very expensive – costing about £130 for 500g.It is also controversial, with animal welfare experts raisingconcernsthat some producers keep civetsin battery-style conditions.Researchers say they have uncovered new clues as to the coffee’s unusual taste, revealing unroasted beans retrieved from civet poo have differences in their fat content to those from ripe coffee berries manually collected from trees.“We believe that the way it is fermented in [the] gut make[s] the profile different,” said Dr Palatty Allesh Sinu, a co-author of the study from the Central University of Kerala, India. “The enzymes and microbiome involved in fermentation [in the civet] [are] different from [the] manual fermentation process.”Writing in the journal Scientific Reports, Sinu and colleagues reported how, in January 2025, they collected beans both from wild civet scat as well as trees across five estates in Karnataka, India, that were cultivatingrobustacoffee.The team then prepared and ground both groups of beans – although they did not roast them – before analysing them.“When roasted, several heat-sensitive oils and esters can be degraded or changed their profile,” said Sinu.While the team noted that someprevious studieshad found kopi luwak has a lower protein and caffeine content compared with traditional coffee – results experts have suggested isdown to the beanspassing through the civet’s gastrointestinal tract – no significant differences in protein or caffeine levels were found between the two groups of beans analysed in the new study.However, the beans from civet poo did have a higher fat content, as well as higher levels of two fatty acid methyl esters – substances based on the building blocks of fats.The team say the results could help explain the taste of kopi luwak.“Fat and oils are essential ingredients of flavoured materials,” said Sinu, noting many volatile organic compounds – substances that help to givearoma and flavour – use fat as a medium or carrier.Ramit Mitra, the first author of the study, said the two fatty acid-based substances were commonly used in the food industry as flavouring agents and were likely to impart a dairy-like flavour.“Hence, we cannot rule out the possibility of these two compounds contributing to the taste profile,” he said.The researchers note there are other important factors that affect the flavour of coffee.“The core taste of coffee develops mainly from roasting and the chemical alterations that occur during that process. Our study focuses on examining the raw form,” said Mitra.Dr Simon Maher, an associate professor in sensors and analytical instrumentation at the University of Liverpool, who was not involved in the work, said the study suggested the civet’s digestion tweaked the beans’ chemical profile.“The civet-processed beans showed subtle differences, with higher fat content and more of certain fatty acids that might influence flavour, albeit the study was based on small samples of unroasted beans,” he said.“Further research is needed to confirm how much of this survives roasting and shows up in sensory tests,” he added.Explore more on these topicsCoffeeBiologyFoodChemistryFood sciencenewsShareReuse this content"

So the saying goes, and whenever I see it on a birthday card, driftwood wall-hanging or kooky coaster, I can’t help but make a mental note that I agree.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.That said, I haven’t always seen the point of cooking with wine, and particularly of cooking wine. Apparently, the general rule is never to cook with any wine that you wouldn’t drink, so there’s me told, because I used to treat wine merely as a descaler for those tasty burnt bits at the bottom of the pan. No more will I slosh wine I’d sooner thin my nail polish with into casseroles and stews (another reason I’m not the cook in my house, I suppose).What does wine add to a dish besides its practical use for deglazing? I asked a few gastronomic authorities how best to use the stuff in my cooking, and it turns out it’s an excellent way to use up leftover wine that may otherwise turn into vinegar.First, what you start with is crucial. The wine shouldn’t be faulty in any way, not least because, while you can burn off the alcohol, you won’t be able to eradicate any further sins, unless you want the unmistakable wet dog aroma of corked wine permeating your meal. Yeugh.The base principles of what wine to use mirror those of general food pairing: red wine with red meat, white with white meat and fish. Beaujolais for a beef casserole, sauvignon for chicken pot pie. But you can take things a step farther and incorporate wine into the ingredients themselves. Chef-patron of Jikoni andGuardian columnist Ravinder Bhogaluses it to make a compound butter. “I never waste dregs,” she says. “I like to reduce a large glass of leftover wine with a chopped shallot by about two-thirds, then fold it into 250g softened butter, which I then roll into a log of greaseproof paper and keep in the fridge.” And why be bound by the whims of fridge-door wine? You can also stash that in the freezer: simply pour into ice cube trays and use within a couple months.“I love poaching fruit with wine to go into desserts,” says Adriann Ramirez, head of pastry atFinksin north London. “It works best with delicate fruit, and what wine you use really matters. Red wine pairs well with figs, rosé with the stone fruits and white with pears. Poach on a low heat so you get to keep some of that booziness in the dessert.”That’s certainly a cut above regular water and sugar. I particularly love using pedro ximénez to poach pears. Sometimes I even put it in the food.Four wines to put in your cookingThe Long Road Viognier£18.50 Tesco, 13.5%. Adds a fruit-forward roundness to casseroles.

Another good idea, which came to me as I pulled a new packet from the back of the dresser and ignored the flutter of tiny wings, was to make more than enough polenta and pour the extra into a Pyrex dish while it was still hot, so it could set into a block to be cut into slices and grilled the next day.I’ve written about polenta before; how the word is ancient and generic – referring to any mushy dish made from cereal flour and water – and how, after its arrival in Europe in the 1600s, it became synonymous with ground maize. There exists a world of different grades and milling, but, broadly speaking, when you buy ground maize (cornmeal) for polenta, you will have two options: finely ground (which might also be white) for a soft, thin polenta, and coarsely ground, which will have glassy-looking grains and makes an excellent body scrub and a harder, tastier polenta. The latter also takes much longer to cook, anything from 40 minutes to several hours, depending on who (or which packet) you consult, although in my experience an hour is almost always enough, and anything beyond that is more a way of deepening the flavour. Stirring is also a matter of opinion, with some saying it must be constant, while others (hello, Anna Del Conte!) noting that after 10 minutes, if the heat is low enough, you can in fact leave the pan to attend to other things, coming back every now and then to give it a strong, hard stir.So, having stirred my polenta intermittently until it looked like a supermoon crossed with a boiling mud pool, I added butter and served most of it with fried mushrooms and slices of melty taleggio. We also had another glass of wine and I forgot the earlier good idea, meaning that several hours later I didn’t come back to a neatly set block of polenta, but a pan with a deep yellow crust. Not being the first time, I do have a solution for this oversight: ignore the pan until the morning, then lever out the bits and fry them with eggs. Another option also involves waiting until the morning and then, using your hands, digging and gouging out the yellow remnants, weighing them, and squashing them with more butter, dried fruit and nuts.Be warned: these patties remain delicate until they cool, so leave them on the tray until they are sturdy enough to move on to a rack. They are best described as a biscuit crossed with a flapjack crossed with a bread pudding, and it is a good idea to have them with a hot drink. The correct idea would be coffee with a shot of grappa.Leftover polenta biscuitsMakesAbout 15400gleftover cold polenta100g room temperature butter, diced180g soft brown sugar100g raisins100gprunes, dried fig or apricots, snipped into bits100g chopped nuts1 tsp nutmeg1 tsp cinnamonOptional handful dry polenta or plain flourHands are best for this. Working in a bowl, break the polenta into bits, then add the butter and squeeze it into the polenta – it will look lumpy, but don’t worry. Add the remaining ingredients apart from the dry polenta or flour, and squeeze again. The mixture will be quite soft, but not so much that it can’t be shaped; if it is very sloppy, add a little dry polenta or flour.Line an oven tray with baking paper. Break off small, plum-sized lumps of the mixture (making about 15 in all) and form them first into balls and then into small patties about 5cm across x 5mm thick. Arrange the biscuits on the tray, and press the tops flat with the back of a fork.Bake at 150C (130C fan)/300F/gas 2 for 45 minutes, or until slightly golden. The biscuits will remain soft and delicate until they cool, so leave them on the tray until they are cool enough to move on to a rack.Explore more on these topicsFoodA kitchen in RomeItalian food and drinkBiscuitsBakingFruitHerbs and spicesrecipesShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.This so-called Super Mic is designed for all those who want a microphone-in-the-hand experience for clearer conversations, recordings and voice notes in noisy environments. For those who talk into the bottom of their phone out in front of them, these are the earbuds for you.But this case upgrade has also upped the price, with the Ear 3 costing £179 (€179/$179/A$299) – £50 more than their predecessors cost at launch. They still undercut top rivals but have edged much closer to the likes of the Google Pixel Buds Pro 2 andApple AirPods Pro 3.View image in fullscreenThe magnets and other details visible through the casing of the earbuds add a little interest to the design.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe Ear 3 still have Nothing’s signature semi-transparent design, with lots of little design elements to set them apart from rather more boring buds, but some of the plastic has been swapped for aluminium for a more shiny look.The shape of the earbuds has been tweaked to be slightly more comfortable over extended listening sessions. They are light, fit securely and create a good seal in my ears. The stalks have squeeze controls for playback, noise cancelling, volume or your voice assistant. They are a little limited but can be customised and work well enough.The buds slot into the square flip-top case for charging, which is pretty compact but quite weighty this year. The battery lasts a solid six hours of playback, with noise cancelling between charges in the case for a total of at least 22 hours. The case charges via USB-C in a little over an hour or about two via Qi wireless charging.View image in fullscreenPress and hold the ‘Talk’ button on the case for the Ear 3’s Super Mic party trick, playing a little tone in the earbuds as the mic activates.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe earbuds have reasonable mics in them, which sound a little robotic at times but do a good job of cutting out background noise. The Super Mic sounds better, with more body and less compression making it great for voice notes, transcription or calls. But the audio quality isn’t quite good enough for use as a lapel mic or similar device for creating recordings.SpecificationsWater resistance:IP54 (splash resistant)Connectivity:Bluetooth5.4 (SBC, AAC, LDAC)Battery life:5.5h with ANC (22h with case)Earbud dimensions:30.5 x 21.5 x 20.8mmEarbud weight:5.2g eachDriver size:12mmCharging case dimensions:56 x 55.5 x 22.3mmCharging case weight:61gCase charging:USB-CGood sound and decent noise cancellingView image in fullscreenThe earbuds come with three sizes of silicone tips for a comfortable fit and good seal.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe earbuds support Bluetooth 5.4 with the standard SBC and AAC audio formats, plus the higher-qualityLDACformat for those Android phones that support it. They can also connect to two devices at once, but doing so caused the Super Mic to be less responsive.Nothing’s previous earbuds have always sounded great for the money, with a good easy-listening sound, plenty of detail and solid separation of tones. The Ear 3 continue the trend but have a bigger sound overall with quite a lot of bass out of the box. It is nice and controlled without overriding the rest of the range, but the excellentNothing X companion appon your phone has plenty of customisation options for those who want something a little more subtle.The noise cancelling does a decent job dampening the general background noise and low rumbles of the commute, and manages the troublesome higher tones such as keyboard taps or chatter better than previous Nothing earbuds. But they can’t muster the same level of noise cancelling of the best earbuds, such as the slightly more expensiveAirPods Pro 3.The transparency mode is also pretty good, sounding quite natural, but neither mode can handle wind noise very well.SustainabilityView image in fullscreenOne of the mics in the case is next to the USB-C charging port, with an LED that lights up in green when the mic is active.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianNothing says the batteries in the earbuds and case will maintain at least 80% of their original capacity for 500 full charge cycles. The earbuds are not repairable but individual out-of-warranty replacements are available through service.The case contains recycled aluminium and tin, but Nothing does not offer trade-in. It estimates the earbuds’ carbon footprint to be 2.87kg.PriceThe Nothing Ear 3 cost£179(€179/$179/A$299).For comparison, the Ear cost£119, theHeadphone 1costs£299, the Google Pixel Buds Pro 2 cost£219, the Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro cost£219and theApple AirPods Pro 3cost£219.VerdictNothing has tried something I’ve never seen before in a set of earbuds, sticking a mic and push-to-talk button into the charging case. It is a novel idea and would be ideal for an interview or videomic replacement. Unfortunately, the mic isn’t quite up to those standards.But for those of us who are not content creators, it works well for calls, recording voice memos or speaking to your phone’s AI assistant, almost like a modern version of a dictaphone for your phone. I just can’t see myself using it very often.The earbuds themselves are another great set from Nothing, which combine good sound, reasonable noise cancelling, solid battery life and a comfortable fit into something much more interesting to look at than your usual boring buds.The price rise into the £180 range pushes them perilously close to some of the very best earbuds in the business, to which they can’t quite hold a candle. And like so many others, the earbuds cannot be repaired,losing them a star.Pros:Super Mic, interesting design, good sound and noise cancelling, comfortable fit, solid controls, Bluetooth 5.4 with multipoint, great cross-platform app, good battery life.Cons:disposable, pricier than predecessors, case quite heavy, Super Mic not quite good enough for a full mic replacement, noise cancelling struggles with louder environments.View image in fullscreenThe Nothing Ear 3 are a good-looking set of earbuds with a party trick or two.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianExplore more on these topicsHeadphonesBluetoothGadgetsreviewsShareReuse this content"

More specifically, toes encased in rubber to create a kind offoot-glove-trainer.The shoes are made by an Italian company, Vibram, and they’re called “FiveFingers”. Why five fingers instead of five toes? I don’t know. It doesn’t matter. They’re cool now.Vibrams used to be known for making kind of niche running shoes, but their toe shoe has since become all the rage –albeit somewhat divisively– among trendy young people.Provocative? Polarising? Or just plain weird? Welcome to ugly shoe summerRead morePolarising, for one, because they look terrifying. And for practical reasons: it takes a little while to individually separate and fit your toes into the proper spots. But once you do, apparently it’s like wearing nothing at all.I like a trend – I’m glad vests came back. But I am not yet convinced about toe shoes. Who has decided these are chic? Where has this come from?As with many trends, celebrities started wearing them, then magazines started writing about them, and now every cool twentysomething you know is sporting them on TikTok.While they were launched back in 2006, it took pop starDoechiiwearing FiveFingers in her music video for Anxiety in April this year for the ball to start to roll. Three months later, K-pop star Jennie Kim of Blackpink was papped wearing a pair at Seoul international airport.The same month, Grazia Daily UK declared Vibram’s “ugly shoe” one of 2025’s“hottest items”.

Tim Dowling’s week in the world’s most divisive shoesRead moreFiveFingers were originally marketed as a functionalperformance shoefor exercise, marketed to tech bros and gym junkies as mimicking barefoot running, before receiving street credibility.It’s not just comfort they offer though. According to Vibram, their product transcends footwear. It’sa “mindset”.“Imagine a life where every step feels light, where movement is fluid and instinctive, where your feet are alive with sensation,” Vibram’s website reads. “You are not just moving, you are awakening.” Come for the shoe, stay for the enlightenment.I feelthis could be like when we all hated on crocs and thenended up getting a pair. How many pennies should I be expecting to part with here?Significantly more than the humble croc, I’m afraid.New Vibram styles are sold online for around A$150 to A$300, and they’re going for in excess of $300 on the reseller website Depop. Matching toe socks, which retail at about $20, are optional.It’s their exclusivity that is undoubtedly part of the allure.But, like crocs, you could also argue their very repulsiveness is what gives them attraction.

But then, we aren’t heading to the usual hot, heady holiday destinations of Spain or the south of France, but boarding a train to north-east Europe. For me, it will be a journey of more than 1,000 miles – via Amsterdam, Berlin and Warsaw to Vilnius – visiting some of the coolest capitals in the north. At least in terms of temperature.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.As England sweltered this summer, and Spain reached a hellish 46C, it made sense to head away from the heat on what is now fashionably being called a “coolcation”. I left in August, with a suitcase full of jumpers.There is something irresistibly romantic about long train trips, watching the geography unfold outside the window. I leave London for Amsterdam on the Eurostar, eating a pain au chocolat as we speed through rural French flatlands and glide past red-roofed Belgian farmhouses, and then the distinctive, tall art nouveau buildings of the Netherlands. In Amsterdam, I switch trains to theDeutsche Bahn, grabbing a packet ofStroopwafeland jumping on board alongside cool Dutch kids with asymmetric hair. I know we have entered Germany when I spot a VW factory, and the graffiti becomes better – and more profuse.As for my coolcation, it feels burning hot when I arrive in Berlin, emerging from the glass and steel Hauptbahnhof into a summer evening where hipsters on deckchairs are drinking cocktails atCapital Beachon the Spree River.View image in fullscreenCapital Beach in Berlin.Photograph: Travelstock44/AlamyThe next morning, I stroll through the lush Tiergarten past men in black leathers chugging in theBiergarten; through the shadowy blocks of the Holocaust memorial; under the intimidating Brandenburg Gate. I’m heading to Alexanderplatz – where teenagers congregate under the TV tower – and I’m ruminating on how eastern European cities have a harsher aesthetic than those in the soft south. The remnants of the Soviet era echo in the hardness of the culture, in the brutalist architecture I’m passing, and then suddenly as pounding techno surrounds me. Marching down Unter Den Linden, I find myself caught in a procession of floats surrounded by people wearing all black, looking like they’re heading toBerghainnightclub.My next train, from Berlin to Warsaw, is theIC Intercitylink. It’s a Polish train, on which the carriages are split into comfortable six-person compartments. In one of these I sit opposite a boy with a mohawk eating paprika crisps, and I watch the city turn to pine forests of pale thin trees.The Stalin-era Palace of Culture and Science in Warsaw now runs silent-disco nights and serves matcha crepesTrain journeys mimic cruises – you hop on and off in different cities (ideal for my ADHD) and, in between, lounge around eating too much. It’s a five-hour journey from Berlin to Warsaw,and when gazing at farmland becomes monotonous, the restaurant carriage offers distraction. I orderKotlet schabowy(€10.50), and a delicious plate of breaded pork chop, cucumber salad and floury boiled potatoes appears, which I eat surrounded by men with blond buzzcuts drinking Żywiec beers.It’s startling to emerge from the bunker of Warsaw Central station to a horizon of glass skyscrapers reflecting the deep red sky.The next day, I discover Warsaw – a captivating juxtaposition of history and modernity. In the Old Town, I eatpierogibesideMarie Curie’s house, then explore cobbled streets with bright rows of coloured medieval buildings, which were bombed during the second world war but have been so faithfully reconstructed they have earnedUnesco status. Their Disneyland-esque quality is only lessened by the artillery pockmarks.View image in fullscreenMarie Curie’s house in Warsaw.Photograph: Konrad Zelazowski/AlamyElsewhere, austere Soviet buildings have morphed into hipster cafes with oak counters and earthenware cups.BarStudio, below the Stalin-eraPalace of Culture and Science– now reclaimed as a tourist attraction with an observation deck – runs silent-disco nights and serves matcha crepes from a menu decorated ironically with communist-era cartoons.Taking a train is far easier than flying – there’s no negotiating airport security or check-in – and soon I become dangerously casual, running and hopping onboard with a picnic of local foods.We roll out of Warsaw and I sit munching Kopernik iced gingerbread biscuits as we pass endless farmland, the occasional dilapidated dacha, factories and small towns of Identikit modern houses in grids. Today’s journey to Vilnius will take nine hours, so it’s a relief when at Mockava, on the Lithuanian border, we are ejected on to a remote platform in a sunny forest. I stand sweltering in 26C heat, wondering why I packed so many jumpers.View image in fullscreenBohemian rhapsody … Užupis district in Vilnius.Photograph: Gediminas Medziausis/Getty ImagesThe black, double-height Lithuanian train is open-plan, modern, slick and packed full of heaving bike racks, but the dining options are disappointingly limited. I eat a sad toasted-cheese sandwich as we glide through more farmland and forests.Vilnius, although the most eastern city I’m travelling to, feels the most western in style. Its baroque buildings – including cathedrals that survived the Soviets and have earned itUnesco status– blend into art nouveau architecture. Even former communist blocks here are painted in soft pastels, and wide boulevards (a USSR endeavour) open up a lush city.

But the enthusiasm for capitalism is evident in the number of luxury Lithuanian boutiques and western brands such as H&M and Mango, and a growing tech industry: Vinted is based here.Užupis, the bohemian quarter – where art exhibitions and Banksy-style graffiti adorn the streets – has its own logo: a blue hand with a hole in the middle. My guide says it shows that money falls through in an enticement to spend, spend, spend, but Užupis’s own tourism minister, Kestas Lukoskinas, has said: “The main thing is we have nothing to hide in our hands.”In Vilnius, even former communist blocks are painted in soft pastels. Elsewhere, meandering cobbled streets offer up cafes and pretty boutiques.Still, the heart and backbone of Vilnius is creative, a scene both historic and constantly reinvented.

AtErtlio Namas, a nine-course tasting menu is an affordable €70, with traditional dishes reinterpreted with modern spin: salted ide fish with jelly, bread soup with beer-braised beef, and buckwheatbabkacome as delicious exquisite morsels.Vilnius repeats Soviet motifs now familiar on my journey: brutalist architecture; cool young people in all black and boots; and the compulsory revampedTV tower, where you can climb to the 67th floor and take a horrifyingly scary walk on a handrail-free ledge, attached only by a rope.The journey home feels faster; the west softer, even though the train is delayed by five hours (so much for German efficiency). I wander Amsterdam hazily, the harsh and uniform brutalism replaced by the uniquely elegant canal houses and oily Van Goghs – yet I’m surprised, among the clatter and chaos, to miss the calm, clean order of the eastern European cities.

You get to twist the knifeFind out how to get a disagreement settled or become a jurorInterviews byGeorgina LawtonThu 23 Oct 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 23 Oct 2025 11.38 EDTShareThe prosecution: FionaI can’t cook with blunt knives and presentfood wellonchipped plates.I want us to live like adultsWhen I moved in with my older sister, Mara, earlier this year, I knew it wouldn’t be my place. She is an artist and her aesthetic is lived-in chaos. There’s a lot of clutter, but it’s the crockery and cutlery that annoys me. The plates don’t match, the mugs are from 10 different holidays, and the cutlery is a mix of gold, silver and plastic. It’s giving student house, and we are 29 and 33 respectively.Mara owns the flat, which has a lot of character, and I needed a new place after changing cities, so it worked out well. As kids, we were very close and quite similar, but we’ve changed a bit.I’m more “uptight”, as she says, and Mara is very relaxed. But I didn’t think she’d be so resistant to my input in the flat. Neither did I imagine I’d be eating pasta with friends using three different types of fork, one of which looks as if it’s survived a war. I’m not saying everything has to be minimalist, but matching crockery does make a space feel more grownup. Mara says I’m trying to be posh, but it’s just about cohesion. Sometimes, I think the ramshackle artist thing is an attempt to look less well off because it’s trendy.Replacing the tableware would help me feel more at homeI want my boyfriend to feel we’ve got our lives together when he comes for dinner. I live here too, and the kitchen is more my domain as I cook more, but I find it hard with all the blunt knives Mara refuses to throw away, and I can’t present things well on chipped plates. I want clean, new kitchenware. There’s a joy in serving dinner on plates that aren’t chipped and mismatched. It feels more like an occasion.The way we eat shapes how we live, and I feel like I’m downgrading my life when I cook in Mara’s flat with all this random stuff. Replacing it would help me feel more at home. I’ve left links open on her laptop to cutlery sets on Amazon, but she keeps saying we don’t need one, even though I’d buy it.Mara says I’m making a big deal out of nothing, and that matching cutlery is soulless. But I just want to eat from things that look as if they belong to adults. What’s wrong with that?The defence: MaraEvery piece in my kitchen has a history. Matching sets are sterile, and my style is more sustainableWhen Fiona moved in I was thrilled because I’d missed her. We last lived together in our family home. But then she started making comments about not just my crockery, but my flat in general. Suddenly, my perfectly good, slightly eclectic tableware was “chaotic” and “studenty”, and my whole flat needed an upgrade.Apparently, the solution is buying everything new, in matching sets. That feels like something you’d find in an Airbnb. My flat is my home, and just because Fiona is here doesn’t mean I have to switch it all up.Every piece in my kitchen has a history. The chipped bowls are from various flatshares and trips over the years. I’ve got pieces gifted by friends who moved abroad. And people who have lived here have left bits and bobs.Matching cutlery feels sterile and devoid of personality to me. Yes, that’s probably because I’m an artist and I like a bit of colour. But life isn’t coordinated so why should the forks be? Plus it matches the vibe with my art and sculptures around the place. I like the fact that no two knives are alike. It’s not messy, it’s my style.Mismatched cutlery isn’t chic to Fiona, but it reflects how I live: relaxed, practical, occasionally sentimentalFiona wants to impress her boyfriend, but I don’t think he’d care. If she cooks, he’s not going to notice what knife she used. I also find the idea of throwing everything out wasteful. We talk about sustainability, and about reusing and repairing, but suddenly the aesthetic matters more than the planet.My sister says it’s her house too and I agree, but I did buy the flat, so itisactually mine. There’s a difference between putting your stamp on a place and rebranding it entirely. Mismatched cutlery isn’t chic to Fiona, but it reflects how I live: relaxed, practical, occasionally sentimental.Fiona keeps sending me links to new cutlery and bowl sets, but I’m not keen. The thought of binning my favourite mugs because they ruin her minimalist vision isn’t filling me with joy. The cutlery drawer stays as it is – it’s a small, joyful rebellion against the tyranny of matching sets.The jury of Guardian readers …Get to dish the dirtskip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

When she finds a new living situation, she can bring them with her. Is that win-win?Rebecca, 31Fiona should move out if she’s trying so hard to control the aesthetic of her sister’s flat. The cutlery drawer is just the tip of the iceberg – Fiona will want to re-cover the sofa next. I have sympathy with Fiona because I like things to be clean and neat too, but the only way to ensure things are as you would like them to be is to get your own place.Kitty, 33It’s Mara’s house, so she shouldn’t have to change if she doesn’t want to. If Fiona feels that strongly about it, she can just buy herself matching sets to use when her boyfriend is over – problem solved.Deb, 48I sympathise with Mara, but keeping old, damaged crockery is a bit like hoarding, and personally I wouldn’t want guests drinking out of cracked cups and eating off chipped plates.Matthew, 39Fiona, why don’t you just buy a nice set of knives, forks, etc, add them to the drawer, and ask Mara not to use them. Ditto the crockery. That way you’ve always got good matching stuff to use and who knows, maybe Mara will be won over. For now, though – mismatched may be OK, Mara, but plastic cutlery is just depressing.

How do I make people understand that I’m happy as I am?Anyone whose life deviates from mainstream expectations gets this, writes advice columnistEleanor Gordon-Smith. Perhaps you could play with different ways to describe itRead moreLeading questionsEleanor Gordon-SmithThu 23 Oct 2025 10.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 23 Oct 2025 18.20 EDTShareI’m 54 years old and, although I was married for 22 years, I’ve been single for the past 14. I did remarry briefly a few years ago, but that chapter was short-lived.At this stage of my life, I feel genuinely content. I’m on my own, but by no means lonely. I have a fulfilling balance between work and personal life, and I’m deeply grateful for my three daughters and my grandchildren, who bring me joy and purpose.My question is: how do I make people understand that I’m happy as I am? Friends and family often tell me I “need” to find someone, or that I shouldn’t be on my own, as if my single status must mean something is missing. Some assume I’m simply waiting to meet the right person, but that’s not the case. Their comments are beginning to wear me down, leaving me questioning myself and feeling low at times.How do I cut out the noise and the unsolicited advice from those who think they know what’s best for me, and return to simply enjoying my life as it is – peaceful, independent, and full in its own way?I’m worried my appearance will jeopardise my career opportunities. Should I modify my look to fit in? | Leading questionsRead moreEleanor says:What a hard time people have when someone says: “I don’t need that to be happy.” Anyone whose life deviates from mainstream expectations gets this, even from well-meaning loved ones. Wait, you’re saying you don’t need a lot of money to be happy? Why aren’t you making more choices in pursuit of money? Oh, you’re saying you don’t need kids to be happy? But what will you do about having kids?It can feel patronising, like you’re wrong about whether your own life is going well.People don’t always realise how presumptive these questions feel when they’re about having a partner. Swap out the topic, though, and it shows up as if back-lit. Imagine saying to someone who was married, happy, with a rewarding job, “now we just need to find you a best friend” – cheerily, as though helping them keep their chin up. It’s only an accident of our culture that it seems any less peculiar to say, “now you need to find a partner!”To push back against this stuff – including, perhaps, in your own head – I wonder whether you could play with different ways to describe things.Sometimes people think they’re describing things accurately when actually they’re painting their own minds on to the world. They look at a scene and think, becauseI’dfeel lonely there,it’slonely. Or, becauseI’dfeel bored with that,it’sboring. Perhaps people look at your life and think, becauseI’dfeel incomplete without a partner,it’sincomplete.But different people can describe the same scene in completely different ways. The risk is you believe other people’s description when actually they’re just saying how they’dfeel.How would you describe your life if you said what you feel? Where other people see the absence of one kind of relationship, maybe you see the value of variety. Where they see “a bit lonely”, you see the calm confidence of self-sufficiency. Where they see someone who could have more, you see someone with more than enough.My best friend of 40 years has a skewed impression of me. How do I set her straight?Read moreUsing those descriptions when talking about your life, even to yourself, can make a big difference. It’s the difference between thinking, “I come home to an empty house”, and “I come home to peace”. If people really push it, you could explicitly tell them how a scene from your life looks to you. “For me, what I see in a morning with my grandkids is pure joy and undivided attention. It doesn’t feel like anything’s missing.” Or, even, if my maths is correct, “you see someone without a marriage. I see someone who had one at 18”. The point isn’t to say “believe me, I’m happy with this”, but to change their sense of whatthisis – to help them see your life under your description, instead of theirs.It sounds like you really are happy. The fact some people prefer to have a partner does not mean a partner is objectively preferable. Don’t let other people’s descriptions of your life persuade you that you’re not happy.Ask Eleanor a questionExplore more on these topicsFamilyLeading questionsAustralian lifestyleDatingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Carol (not her real name), a traffic manager at a local council, was not a typical client for Davison. As the director of investigations at AnotherDay, a crisis consultancy in London, Davison usually works for wary companies and wealthy individuals. A former police detective, Davison has recovered stolen cryptocurrency, uncovered secret properties owned by bankrupt business people and tracked down fraudsters to Cyprus.Davison’s speciality is private prosecutions, a little-known area of law that allows victims to pay for justice. These cases are heard in the same courts used by theCrown Prosecution Service(CPS), the public prosecutor for England and Wales, and they can carry the same amount of prison time for suspects. “We really mirror the process between the police and the CPS,” Davison said. The difference is that the police are agents of the state, whereas people call on Davison when the state fails to help.Carol’s ex-boyfriend, Jiro Wilson, had persuaded her to lend him money to finance a company he was setting up. In exchange, Wilson promised her shares in his fledgling firm. “Looking back, I could see how stupid I was to believe him,” Carol later recalled in a witness statement. “He would often call me paranoid, and certainly made me feel this way when I suspected [he was] seeing other women.”One evening, while surreptitiously scrolling through Wilson’s phone, she saved the numbers of other women in his address book, and began texting them in secret. To Carol’s horror, three women told her that Wilson had also “borrowed” thousands of pounds from them, too. Carol set up a WhatsApp group, and arranged to meet the women at one of their homes in Exeter. The four women discovered that each had been duped in the same way. “He was a disgusting narcissist,” one of them told me. In total, Wilson had stolen £46,000 from them, promising they would reap the benefits of investing in his company. He spent the money on escorts, eating out and motorbikes.Carol reported Wilson’s theft to the police, who referred her to the national fraud hotline, which gave her a reference number and never contacted her again. The three other women also failed to interest law enforcement in their case. More than getting their money back, the women wanted justice. One contacted a solicitor in Exeter called Jeremy Asher. “It was very obvious that this was a substantial fraud committed by a very devious, calculating manipulator,” Asher recalled. “But the police weren’t interested.” Asher advised the women to bring a private prosecution. Doing so would be expensive – in the tens of thousands of pounds – but their case was so strong that Asher said the court would probably reimburse their costs. So the women cobbled together the money, and on Asher’s recommendation, Carol contacted Davison, the private investigator.As he dug into the case, Davison found that Wilson also appeared to have fiddled his VAT returns.The judge who heard the private prosecution in December 2020 decided Wilson’s offences were potentially so serious that the CPS should take over the case. The CPS passed the case to the police, who discovered that Wilson had submitted nearly £250,000 in fraudulent VAT returns, and had stolen a further £50,000 from a government loan scheme. On 13 June 2023, Wilson pleaded guilty to seven counts of fraud at Exeter crown court. A judge sentenced him to six years in prison and described him as a “dishonest parasite”.Had the police taken Carol and the other women’s initial allegations more seriously, a private prosecution would never have been necessary. But their experience is not uncommon. The result is that over the past decade, a parallel criminal justice system has emerged in England and Wales, staffed by lawyers who specialise in privately prosecuting crimes, and former police officers who investigate them. The Ministry of Justice (MoJ) doesn’t maintain a public record of private prosecutions, but in 2024 they accounted for a quarter of all cases in magistrates courts in England and Wales. According to one law firm, between 2016 and 2021 the number of private prosecutionsmore than doubled. “Fifteen years ago, they were very rare,” said Sandip Patel KC, a barrister who specialises in white-collar crime. Since then, “it’s been like the stock market going up. It’s just a vertical line.”Some regard these prosecutions as a solution to shrinking state budgets, and away to access justicewhen all other routes have failed. But the risk is that well-resourced victims can afford something denied to others. Adrian Darbishire KC, a defence barrister, told me that, in his experience, private prosecutions were typically brought by “people who can afford to spend a million, or a couple of million, if it comes to it”. The cost of investigating complex cases puts such prosecutions beyond the reach of most ordinary people. “As it stands, they fill a gap in name only,” said Nick Vamos, a solicitor at Peters & Peters, a City law firm. “If you really wanted to fill that gap, the best way to do it would be by properly funding the criminal justice system.”In almost every conversation I had about the rise of private prosecutions, one law firm cropped up: Edmonds Marshall McMahon (EMM). “They do private prosecutions on an almost industrial scale,” said Steven Kay KC, a barrister who works on white-collar crime. Another solicitor said: “They were the first. They spotted a niche.” EMM was founded in 2012, not long after the coalition governmentannounceddrastic cutsto the MoJ. The firm’s three founders used to work as government prosecutors for the Department of Health, the CPS and theSerious Fraud Office(SFO). They are now enjoying more lucrative careers in the private sector. “We saw there was a gap in the market – that private prosecutions would inevitably grow the more that the state stepped back,” said Tamlyn Edmonds, the firm’s co-founder and managing partner. “And pretty much from day one,” she recalled, “the phones started ringing.”There was one major type of case they were dealing with. In the 2010s, politicians often said that crime was decreasing, an idea that lent justification to Theresa May’sdecision to axe 21,000 police officerswhile she was home secretary. But while it was true that violent crime was going down, other types were going up. In 2017, when the Office for National Statistics (ONS) began including online fraud in its England and Wales crime survey, the recordedcrime rate nearly doubled.Since then, fraud has only grown. In England and Wales, itincreased by 31%in 2024 alone. Yet the police have, as a rule, shown little interest in tackling it. Several former police officers told me that it was regarded as boring. “There’s a real focus towards action. Catching a burglar and chasing them down the street,” said Mike Neville, a former detective chief inspector in the Metropolitan police. Whereas with fraud cases, “you need someone who is willing to go through a thousand pages of a spreadsheet”. Few people join the police to pore over Microsoft Excel documents. As one officer put itin a 2019 report,“Fraud doesn’t bang, bleed or shout.”The main port of call for victims is the national hotline, Action Fraud, which was founded in 2009. When Alfie Moore, a retired sergeant in the Humberside police, used to work at a control room logging 101 and 999 calls, he would often direct callers to Action Fraud. “We thought, these kids are the dog’s bollocks. They’ve got loads of money, they’re switched on,” he remembered. “You’re not talking about some PC in Scunthorpe who has no idea.”In reality, Action Fraud is a call centre whose day-to-day running was, until 2019, outsourced to a private US company called Concentrix, which employed call handlers who received just two weeks of training and were paid close to the minimum wage. When the Times placed an undercover reporter at Action Fraud in 2019, they found staff taking calls from victims while scrolling through their phones and play-fighting. Some of their managers mocked fraud victims as “morons”. (Concentrix lost its contract soon after the investigation.)Data onfraud offences is patchy, but one report from 2023 found thatjust 6%of reports to Action Fraud were passed to the police. Of that tiny percentage, only a small fraction – 8% in 2024 – will result in a court ruling. Action Fraud is due to be replaced next year, after theJustice Committee foundthat it was not fit for purpose; one name under consideration for the new service is “Report Fraud”, which feels like a more honest summary of its work. (A spokesperson for Action Fraud told me this new service will lead to “better data sharing”, provide “specialist advice and support to victims” and allow the police to conduct more “effective” investigations.)Most of EMM’s clients have previously tried Action Fraud. “They either get an automated response, or it ends up with an officer who advises that it’s a civil case, rather than a criminal case, even when it’s very clear it’s a criminal case,” Edmonds told me. Lawyers at EMM report most of their criminal cases to the police after the firm has investigated, giving the authorities another opportunity to take these over before EMM commences a private prosecution. Edmonds estimated that the firm has prosecuted 340 cases in the past five years, 90% of which resulted in criminal convictions. She could only recall two instances when the police had taken over the cases of EMM clients.The growth of private prosecution reflects a wider trend in which vital parts of the public sector have been squeezed out of existence and gradually replaced by ad-hoc and expensive alternatives. TheMoJ claims that the average costof a private prosecution is £8,500, but complex cases that are heard in the crown courts, which deal with more serious offences than magistrates courts, can quickly reach into the tens or hundreds of thousands. “You’ll easily do half a million on a proper fraud,” said Kay. “These are expensive cases – you’ve got to do all the disclosure, hire a former police officer to investigate, and the costs rack up.”While victims cover the upfront costs of private prosecutions, many of their costs are ultimately funded by taxpayers, whether or not their case is successful. Every time a firm wraps up a private prosecution, they ask the judge to reimburse them from central funds, a pot of government money that covers the costs incurred in criminal prosecutions. The Criminal Cases Unit, part of the MoJ, then reviews the firm’s application and decides how much money they get back. “It’s not a blank cheque,” said Patel. “But in my experience, you typically get 80% or 90% of your costs reimbursed.” Firms such as EMM charge a higher hourly rate than CPS solicitors, so private prosecutions “almost inevitably cost the state much more”, one judge saidin a 2014 ruling.According to a freedom of information request, the government has paid out more than £32m to EMM to cover the firm’s fees since 2014. Between 2014 and 2019, the most recent years for which data is available, the amount the government spent on paying private prosecutorsincreased by more than 3,000%.Until recently, private prosecutionswere a rarity. In some cases, they were a last resort. In 1994, Doreen Lawrence brought one of the most high-profile private prosecutions of recent decades, after the Metropolitan police and CPS failed to investigate or bring the murderers of her son, Stephen, to justice. Mostly, though, private prosecutions were brought by charities and membership bodies. The Federation for the Abuse of Copyright prosecuted people for pirating VHS tapes; the RSPCA prosecuted animal cruelty. “I remember prosecuting someone who hung up cats in a garage and tortured them for his own sick pleasure,” said Carl Woolf, a solicitor who used to act for the RSPCA, and has since founded his own firm specialising in private prosecutions.Asmore recent cuts have compromised Britain’s criminal justice system, there has been a new interest in private prosecutions. Between 2010 and 2014, after the coalition government ordered the MoJ to slash its budget byalmost a quarter, theCPS lost 22% of its solicitorsand28% of its barristers. From 2010 to 2019, the MoJ closed more thanhalf of all the courtsin England and Wales, and sold off many court buildings. There are now almost400,000criminal cases waiting to be heard in England and Wales. So far, attempts at reducing this number have been fruitless, and the government has begun considering more radical solutions, such as trials without juries.“This is why private prosecutions are becoming so popular: it takes ages for the courts to make a decision, the CPS is overwhelmed, and the courts have this massive backlog,” said Woolf. These prosecutions allow wealthier victims of crime to avoid the problem of overworked (or uninterested) police, and they can also be considerably cheaper than suing someone in the civil courts, since private prosecutors can recover their costs from the taxpayer regardless of whether they win or lose.View image in fullscreenDoreen Lawrence in 2023.Photograph: Aaron Chown/PAPrivate prosecutions can also be useful weapons: Darbishire, the KC, mentioned having seen cases where wealthy people “try to use private prosecutions just as a way of bullying someone, basically”. Rail companies have been particularly adept at criminalising people for minor rule-breaking in recent years, fast-tracking draconian prosecutions through something known as the “single justice procedure”. Defendants receive a letter detailing a charge, to which they must respond within 21 days. If they don’t respond (because the letter gets lost in the post, say), they can be tried and sentenced by a single magistrate, who can criminally convict them without a court hearing, using only minimal evidence. In 2023, a woman received acriminal recordforusing her railcard to save a total of £1.60: unbeknown to her, the railcard wasn’t valid for off-peak tickets. Last year, 74,000 of these rail convictions were quashed, after a judge ruled they were“probably unlawful”.Far from making the system more efficient, private prosecutions are heard in the same courts as public prosecutions, so they get stuck in – and contribute to – the same bottlenecks. “There’s a long waiting list for rape and sexual assault cases – some take three, four, five years to be heard. If you asked most people, would you rather the courts be used to litigate a private financial dispute against someone’s former business partner, or for serious violent offences, most people would say serious violent offences,” Patel, the KC, told me. “Why should a private prosecution have access to publicly funded courts, free of charge, and stop public cases from going through?”If there were a prize for the most prolific private prosecutor in England and Wales, it would go to a former police detective named David McKelvey. Through his private investigations company, TM Eye, which operates from a scrubby business park near Epping, McKelvey has seized upon the commercial opportunities afforded by shrinking police budgets and a creaking criminal justice system.TM Eye originally investigated counterfeit cases – people selling fake designer handbags or trainers, say – which it would then hand over to Trading Standards, a government department that can bring criminal prosecutions. Designer brands would then pay TM Eye if its investigation resulted in a successful prosecution. If McKelvey’s team found evidence of a larger conspiracy, such as a gang selling counterfeits to fund drug trafficking, they referred this to the police. But over the past decade, the budget for Trading Standards has shrunk bymore than 50%. With little chance of the state now prosecuting straightforward counterfeit cases, McKelvey landed on the idea of taking suspects to court himself.McKelvey, who is 63, relishes the tradecraft of his work. When we met at TM Eye HQ, he regaled me with favourite cases, such as the time he recruited a former NationalCrimeSquad officer and posted her to live for six months in an area of Manchester known to locals as “Counterfeit Street”, or the time his team infiltrated a Triad gang selling bootlegged tobacco mixed with asbestos dust. He showed me to the “evidence room” on the first floor, where clear plastic boxes of Louis Vuitton handbags and Lost Mary vapes had been numbered and stacked neatly on top of one another. “We started at one,” McKelvey said, patting a box. “Now we’re into the 9,000s.”McKelvey estimates that TM Eye has prosecuted more than 1,000 counterfeit cases since 2015. One might assume that luxury brands paid a retainer to the firm, but it is taxpayers who ultimately fund many of these prosecutions.McKelvey’s firm fronts the initial costs of investigating suspects, and then passes its investigation to a law firm such as EMM, which prosecutes on its behalf. Once the case is over, the law firm applies to central funds to have its costs and those of TM Eye reimbursed. According todata obtained by the Financial Timesin 2023, TM Eye had claimed costs of about £12m and been paid £6m out of central funds since it was founded. The luxury brands that benefit from TM Eye’s activities have paid nothing.View image in fullscreenMy Local Bobby security officers on patrol Covent Garden in central London.Photograph: Jill Mead/The GuardianMcKelvey told me that TM Eye’s private prosecutions are a “loss leader”. The real profits flow from its sister company, My Local Bobby, a private policing firm he founded in 2016. High-street shops and wealthy groups of neighbours pay MLB, as it’s known, to dispatch red-vested teams of “bobbies”, many of them former police or army officers, to patrol the streets. Unlike your average security guard, McKelvey’s bobbies conductcitizen’s arreststo detain suspects until the police arrive. Once a bobby has made an arrest, TM Eye will begin assembling the evidence for a private prosecution. McKelvey’s bobbies rely heavily on body-worn cameras, which are beamed into the Citadel, a windowless room on the first floor of TM Eye’s headquarters lit by a wall of TV screens.Shoplifting is the most common crime that My Local Bobby deals with, and private prosecutions are the firm’s USP. The company takes a harsher approach than the police, who are more likely to give cautions for such offences. Several people I spoke with felt that the police had retreated from fighting crimes such as shoplifting and phone snatching. Three former officers, including McKelvey, told me that the coalition government’s decision to make stealing goods under £200 into a “summary offence”, which carry shorter sentences, had effectively given criminals a free pass. “These thieves aren’t stupid,” said Neville, the former Met detective. “Why nick £200 when you can nick £199 five times?”Some have blamed the rise in shoplifting, which is now at itshighest level since records began in 2001, on poverty. The connection is complex: deprivation can make people more likely toturn to crime, but not all shoplifters are poor, and many of those arrested by My Local Bobby are routine offenders who steal to fund addictions (which can also cause, or be caused by, deprivation). Even so, there is a general consensus that shoplifting has surged since the cost-of-living crisisbegan in 2021. Carl Woolf, who frequently prosecutes cases on behalf of TM Eye and My Local Bobby, told me that he often encounters people “who will go into a shop and steal hundreds of bottles of baby formula. They’re selling it because people need it and can’t afford it.”Despite the growing demand for this shadow justice system, some people I spoke with worried they belonged to an industry on the verge of extinction. “We are getting mullered by the MoJ,” McKelvey said. The government has become stingier about the amount of money it awards to private prosecutors, he claimed. “In the old days, they’d sit there and go yes, yes, yes, check. Nowadays, and probably for the last four or five years, they go red line, red line, red line.”Thevictims and courts billcurrently making its way through parliament contains an explosive detail that could topple the entire business model. It proposes that lawyers should only be awarded “reasonably sufficient” costs from central funds. The bill doesn’t state how much would count as “reasonably sufficient”, but in theory it could mean that highly paid lawyers would suddenly find themselves earning legal aid rates, or the kind of charged by CPS prosecutors. Unsurprisingly, this idea is not popular with lawyers in the industry. “Private prosecutors are standing in the shoes of what should be a state function,” said Tamlyn Edmonds. “But the state hasn’t acted, so why should the private prosecutor be out of pocket?”View image in fullscreenAlan Bates in 2000, when he was operator of the Craig-y-Don Post Office in Llandudno, north Wales.Photograph: Mirrorpix/Getty ImagesEarlier this year, the MoJ took a swipe at private prosecutors in aconsultation paper, alleging that some of them had “acted unlawfully, improperly and well below the standards the public expects”. Its main target was the Post Office, which brought918 successful private prosecutionsagainst its post office operators between 1991 and 2015, sending innocent employees to prison for theft and fraud. In theory, it should be possible to distinguish between Post Office-style scandals and justified cases, since the CPS can put a stop to any private prosecution. In practice, it is too overstretched to monitor every case. And since there is no publicly accessible record of private prosecutions, it is hard to see how many are taking place overall, or which ones could be abusing the system. (“It appears that the only institution which was aware of the number of prosecutions being brought by the Post Office was, until recently, the Post Office,” the justice committee noted in 2020.) Sam Townend KC, a barrister and former chair of the Bar Council, described the actions of the Post Office and some rail companies as “horrific examples of the sometimes arbitrary power of large corporations to bring private prosecutions”, adding: “They have cast a dreadful shadow over the field.”Edmonds was careful to draw a division between these recent scandals and private prosecutions in general. “There was probably far more trust in the Post Office than there is with independent private prosecutors,” she said. “There’s a huge amount of scrutiny once you’re in court.” Even so, the court should carefully consider the motives of clients wanting to bring private prosecutions. In 2021, Pradeep Morjaria, a wealthy Dubai-based businessman, instructed EMM to issue a criminal summons against a property developer called Camran Mirza, whom Morjaria was also suing in a parallel civil case. The prosecution seemed less like a route to justice than a means of using the British legal system to intimidate an enemy into settling. At one point, Morjaria emailed EMM stating that “we need serious firepower and threat of maximum jail term to bring [Mirza] to his knees”. A judge later threw out the case, criticising its “truly oppressive” nature. “The purpose of the criminal process is not to serve the private interests of any individual,”he ruled. When I asked Edmonds about this case, she said she couldn’t comment.If such prosecutions provoke a fundamental unease, it can be because they assume a power that many people think should belong to the state. “How do we feel about the state effectively lending the keys to its tanks to a private individual, and saying, you can have fun with these for a little while?” said Darbishire, the KC and defence barrister. Edmonds and other private prosecutors I spoke with were keen to emphasise that they applied the same public interest test as the state does when deciding whether to prosecute. But unlike a CPS lawyer, who receives a salary regardless of whether they prosecute a case, EMM gets paid to bring cases, not turn them down. “The old thing that used to be said about public prosecutors was that they enjoy no victories and suffer no defeats,” said Ken Macdonald, the former director of public prosecutions. “If you’re a private law firm and your whole business model depends on bringing private prosecutions, you want to win. Your business model is: we will get you a conviction.”Chortle chortle, scribble scribble: inside the Old Bailey with Britain’s last court reportersRead moreIf the government reduces the fees that private prosecutors can claim back from the state, the industry that has thrived in the wreckage of austerity will surely wither. So long as the government continues to deprive the criminal justice system of adequate funding, however, the demand for such alternatives will persist. During my reporting, three separate barristers mentioned the health service. They drew a parallel between private prosecutions and the clinics and surgeries that improvise expensive solutions to the problem of a decrepit public institution. In both instances, the solution only compounds the problem: when some people can buy their own criminal cases or cancer treatments, they have fewer reasons to invest in the idea of improving these things for everyone else.Listen to our podcastshereand sign up to the long read weekly emailhere."

We followed these babiesat five-yearintervalsup to 2015– the date the United Nations had set for achievingthe millennium development goals– as a way to tell stories that might be those of millions of others across the continent as they worked to provide the best chance for their children.Although some progress was made, the millennium development goals were not met by 2015 and that year UN member states adopted a new approach – the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development with17 goalsfor ending poverty and inequality, while also tackling the climate crisis. With five years to go,only 18% of those goalsare on track to be met.This year, the Guardian set out to track down those children born in 2005 to see how their lives were turning out. It took months of work and many proved untraceable; but we caught up with three – in Malawi, Ghana andSouth Africa. These are their stories.Innocent Smoke – MalawiView image in fullscreenInnocent Smoke as a baby in 2005; as a 10-year-old in 2015; and today, at the age of 20.Composite: Guardian DesignHome forInnocent Smoketoday is one room that he shares with his wife and baby in Mponela, on the outskirts of the Malawian capital, Lilongwe. The small agricultural town lies about 36 miles from where he was born in 2005.With brick walls, a cement floor and a roof of corrugated iron, it is far more advanced than the straw-thatched hut where he grew up. He pays 15,000 Malawian kwacha (£6.50) a month in rent for his home, which has no running water or electricity.In 2022, Innocent married Edess Gwalanya, 22, who grew up in a village two miles from where he was living with his parents. They met when Gwalanya was on her way to church; he asked her out, and they married less than a year later.View image in fullscreenInnocent with his wife, Edess, and their son, Israel, at their home in Mponela, Malawi. He now works on rebuilding the M1 road in Kasungu.Photograph: Amos Gumulira/The GuardianThe couple’s first child was born in January last year but he died of heart problems a day later. Malawi has a relatively high infant mortality rate, with an estimated29 babies in 1,000 dying before their first birthday.“We were devastated as a family because we had accepted his arrival as a gift from God,” says Innocent. “But we were uplifted by the realisation that it was God who gave us the child and it was God who took him away. We are now happy that God gave us another child.”I am scared about my job security … I am married and have a child so losing a job is a terrifying prospectTheir second son, who is happy babbling away in the background, was born in January and is named Israel, after Innocent’s late grandfather.Innocent, who has a certificate in motorcycle mechanics, has done a few jobs, including working in a shoe factory, as a cleaner at a school, a security guard at a hospital and on a farm. “I acquired the vocational skills because I could afford the fees for the training, but I have been struggling to raise resources to open my garage to repair motorcycles,” he says.View image in fullscreenInnocent with his mother, Lenita, in the Malawian capital, Lilongwe, in 2005.Photograph: Martin Godwin/The GuardianHe is now working for a Chinese construction company that is renovating the M1 road, a key route that connects landlocked Malawi to the Tanzanian port of Dar es Salaam. The job involves testing soil and cement on the newly laid asphalt.Innocent’s dream is to build a house for his family, but he says: “I am scared about my job security and possible unemployment. I am married and have a child, so losing a job is a terrifying prospect. The cost of living, particularly food, is very high, so one needs a job to survive.”Unemployment among young people is high, with more than half of those aged 18-35 without jobs and looking for work. More than half of young people haveconsidered leaving the country, according to the pan-African research network Afrobarometer.View image in fullscreenInnocent takes a sample of the road material to test the quality of its construction.

For years, the economy depended on tobacco, but global anti-smoking campaigns have put the country’s biggest export under severe pressure.Candidates should have the right policies to fight poverty and make life in villages betterThe majority of Malawians are born and die in poverty. It is a reality that Innocent, a voter in last month’spresidential elections, is hoping can still be reversed.“Candidates for leadership should have the right policies to fight poverty and make the life of people in the villages better. They cannot employ everyone but should make sure they create enough companies that will employ enough people so that we can reduce poverty,” he says.“I voted for my preferred candidate,” Innocent says. “Someone who can change my fortunes as well.”Golden Matongain LilongweHannah Adzo Klutsey – GhanaView image in fullscreenHannah Adzo Klutsey as a baby in 2005; aged 10, when she dreamed of becoming a doctor; and now as an apprentice baker.Composite: Guardian DesignAt 10,Hannah Adzo Klutseydreamed of becoming a doctor, hoping to lift her family from poverty in Sapeiman, a suburb of Ghana’s capital, Accra.Today, at 19, that dream has evaporated, replaced by the reality of baking cookies and layering buttercream on cakes in a makeshift shop in Ofankor Barrier, just outside Accra.View image in fullscreenHannah holding her mother Mary’s finger in 2005.Photograph: David Levene/The GuardianHannah is thankful for her apprenticeship, but it is a far cry from her dreams. “Life pushed me here,” she says, wiping flour from a bowl.

I am proud of my parents and myselfUntil the Covid-19 pandemic,poverty in Ghana had fallen considerably. However, projections have worsened as households have been under pressure from high inflation and slowing economic growth. According to the World Bank,poverty is projected to rise, reaching 51.2% by 2027.Hannah, who has a nasal growth and struggles with chronic headaches and difficulties breathing at night, is unable to afford hospital care and often self-medicates with pharmacy painkillers and herbal remedies.View image in fullscreenHannah, centre, with her family in 2015.Photograph: Sam Jones/The GuardianUnlike many peers who are single mothers or married, Hannah does not have a husband or children. “I don’t even have a boyfriend,” she says with a smile. “My biggest dream is to make my parents proud.”Her sleeping quarters are a cramped metal container that she shares with two other apprentices – Betty and Patience.

She did not continue because she had problems with reading and spelling. Many of her classmates who continued their education will graduate from Ghana’s free senior high schools this year. Those with good grades will have the opportunity to enrol at university.Hannah does not regret abandoning school and dismisses suggestions that she could be disadvantaged for not continuing with higher education. “I like what I am doing now,” she says. “I am proud of my parents and myself.”She points out that while her peers are awaiting their exam results to determine their qualification for further education, she will soon finish her apprenticeship and open her own shop. “I’ll achieve more than them,” she says. “Some day, I’ll go to university to study catering.”Hannah’s father, Benjamin, who makes a living selling sand, says: “Apart from her learning difficulties, education became too expensive so we decided to put her into an apprenticeship.” However, he adds: “Hannah’s apprenticeship is not cheap either.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toGlobal DispatchFree newsletterGet a different world view with a roundup of the best news, features and pictures, curated by our global development teamEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Now, exactly a month after being discharged, Swartbooi is convinced that his drug use is a thing of the past. “I’m nottryingto stop,” he says. “I stopped smoking. I no longer smoke.”And he is excited about his future. “I want to take this second chance,” he says. “I am grateful that my parents sent me to rehab.”He is sitting on a plastic chair he borrowed from a neighbour in the nine-square-metre room his family has lived in since 2023.

He says he started smoking cannabis due to “peer pressure” and insists he has never used anything other than cannabis and alcohol.His mother does not believe him. “There is no way weed can make you that crazy,” Nonzuzo says but she has forgiven him. “That was not Siya,” she says.“Most people around him were shocked. Even his teachers were so surprised. He was good in school,” his mother adds.Things came to a head earlier this year. “He came home one evening and just stood there staring at us,” remembers Nonzuzo. “He was saying things we couldn’t understand, going up and down, from 7pm until 3 in the morning.” Eventually she called the police, and they took him to hospital.He just stood there staring at us … saying things we couldn’t understandNonzuzo SwartbooiWhile Siya was initially angry at his parents for sending him to rehab, he says he started to think more seriously about his future. After a few days in a local clinic, he was transferred to a larger facility and then to a dedicated psychiatric hospital.In total, he spent three months in rehab, an experience he describes as “fun” (he especially enjoyed learning to meditate) despite missing his family. Nonzuzo made a point of only visiting him twice: “I wanted him to feel like what he’s doing is totally wrong.”View image in fullscreenSiya in class at Isiphiwo school in Khayelitsha, outside Cape Town, in 2015.Photograph: Ellen Elmendorp/The GuardianA study published in theInternational Journal of Drug Policyin 2024 suggests the number of South Africans taking illicit drugs jumped more than sixfold between 2002 and 2017.Recent drug use was also “associated with having multiple sexual partners in the last year … experiencing psychological distress, and being less likely to have ever been tested for HIV”, the study found.Africa’s children: 10 years on – interactiveRead moreSince leaving rehab, Siya spends a lot of time at home alone, meditating on the double bed and entertaining the neighbours’ children. “He loves kids so much,” says Nonzuzo. Siya laughs in agreement: “I like spending time with kids, they are fun, they make me enjoy my day.”Although the neighbours keep an eye on Siya for her, Nonzuzo is worried that having so much time on his hands could be dangerous. In the short term she is encouraging him to join a gym and in January (the start of the South African academic year) she wants him to enrol in vocational short courses at a private college, even if she has to pay for them herself. She will apply for government funding, but it is not guaranteed.Siya is upbeat about his future and is keen to train as an electrician. “There are opportunities for work in South Africa, but you need a skill,” he says.Nonzuzo jokes that she is scared of electricity, before moving on to more serious matters. “I am hoping that in the next 10 years you guys won’t find us here,” she says. “We will have a house.”View image in fullscreenSiya at home.

There was no time. She grabbed her papers, pulled her elderly mother into a friend’s car, and tried to get the animals out of the shed. Smoke and the speed of the blaze made it impossible. She didn’t see the animals burning, but learned of their fate later.Smoke smothered Studenok, turning the village as dark as night. Pryprosta’s neighbours fought the flames with shovels, digging in scorched earth to stop the crown fire’s advance. Firefighters arrived, but the blaze was relentless. At one point, it surged around a fire truck, trapping the crew.Mines and unexploded ordnance, left scattered since the Russian occupation and subsequent liberation in 2022, detonated in the heat. Each explosion fed the flames, sending burning debris, branches and embers flying across the village. Trees ignited, and wood fragments were hurled 700-800 metres, recalls Serhii Kohan, the village head.View image in fullscreenA forest fire after an attack near Sloviansk in Donetsk in August 2024. Nearly a million hectares of land burned in Ukraine last year.Photograph: Evgeniy Maloletka/APOnly at about 9pm, when the wind shifted and the explosions subsided, could the units move in and finally begin to fight the flames. Pryprosta and the other villagers survived, huddled in a neighbouring settlement. When they returned, they found many homes burnt, along with blackened trees and mangled structures, another scar on a village already devastated by war.Thehighest numberof fires on Ukraine-controlled territory this year have been in forests surrounding Izium in Kharkiv oblast (province), where Studenok sits, according to the state enterprise Forests of Ukraine. In the first eight months of 2025, Kharkiv oblast accounted for 60% of all forest fires. The fire that engulfed Studenok had ignited in a national park forest about 14 miles (23km) from the village and swept rapidly north, consuming 6,000 hectares (14,800 acres) as it burned.Animated map of Ukraine fires over timeWaging war in a tinderboxExpanding wildfires have become part of the “new normal” in a hotter world. But the scale of burning in Ukraine is extraordinary even on those terms, far surpassing anything witnessed across the rest of Europe. In 2024,nearly a million hectares of Ukraine burned: more than twice the area that burned across the entire EU over the same period.About 50% of the time, while we’re fighting a fire, a drone flies up to our fire truck and we have to neutralise itSerhii Skoryk, director, Kamianska Sich national parkAnalysis by the Guardian and Kyiv Independent of satellite imagery, monitoring data and on-the-ground testimony connects the devastation of Ukraine’s forests directly to the Russian invasion. The fires have stretched in an arc across the frontline of the war in Ukraine. Blazes are concentrated in oblasts in the east, where the majority of fighting has taken place.The fires in Ukraine are unlike those in Canada and Siberia, where huge areas burn over several months. Monitoring data shows hundreds of small, frequent fires that burn at a low intensity, almost certainly started by explosions. Abandoned farmland that is becoming grassland or young forest accounts fora third of the burned areain 2024. Hot and dry conditions turned the frontline into a tinderbox, where blasts often became larger fires that were impossible to control safely due to the presence of landmines.Chart showing how Ukraine recorded the most burned land of any European country last yearThat combination turned 2024 into one of the worst fire years on record in Donetsk, Luhansk and Zaporizhzhia, says James MacCarthy, a research associate with Global Forest Watch. “In Donetsk alone, tree cover loss from fire was more than 40 times the long-term average for 2001 to 2023. Years of conflict, forest degradation and extreme heat have primed these landscapes to burn.”View image in fullscreenExploding mines help to spread fires in the Sviati Hory national park.Photograph: Thomas Peter/ReutersRescue workers under attackNational park workers and firefighters say the flames are not the only threat. As they attempt to douse them, they say they are being targeted by Russian drones.“Drones are always overhead,” says Serhii Skoryk, director of Kamianska Sich national park. “While a few of us put out the fire, two others stand by with rifles, watching to make sure a drone doesn’t fly in and hit the truck.”Park employees fight fires themselves because the state emergency service considers the territory too dangerous to operate in. At first, they put electronic warfare systems (which jam drone signals) on the fire trucks. But they found the jammers were not working on the latest generations of drones, so turned to borrowed hunting rifles to keep them at bay.“About 50% of the time, while we’re fighting a fire, a drone flies up to our fire truck and we have to neutralise it,” Skoryk says.War affects nature in a complex way – every part of the ecosystem suffers. Some changes can be reversed, but others will not recoverKateryna Polianska, ecologistVideos posted by Russian troops on social media show clearly marked fire trucks and personnel being attacked. Often these attacks follow a “double-tap” pattern, with an initial explosion causing a fire, and the same site attacked a second time after rescue and fire crews arrive. One Russian drone-operating brigade in Kherson regularly posts first-person footage videos from drone attacks to their Telegram channel. In one series of clips, the drone pilots target a petrol station, causing a fire. When the fire truck arrives to fight it, a second “suicide” drone flies headlong into the truck, exploding on impact. The Guardian and the Kyiv Independent cross-referenced those videos with photos provided by Ukraine’s state emergency service, of the fire truck’s cab damaged by the explosion.Footage from a drone attackRussian forces carry out a double-tap strike in Kherson on 6 July, 2025. A drone hits a petrol station, causing a fire. A second drone then targets a fire truck responding to the fire. The video cuts out on impact with the truck, which was damaged.While damage and fires are a common consequence of war, deliberately targeting rescue workers, igniting fires or encouraging them to burn in a way that causes deliberate, long-term destruction of the environment would be considered a war crime under international law. The Russian government did not respond to a request for comment.Dropped by drones and scattered by rockets: how Ukraine became one of the most heavily mined countries in the worldRead moreAcross Ukraine, prosecutors are working to determine whether attacks are intentionally targeting natural resources. Trees have provided both sides with cover from drones, making forests a target for deliberate fires, say experts.“There are no accidental shellings – every strike is a deliberate military action,” says Vitaliy Nikitin, deputy head of the Kherson regional prosecutor’s office. “Every instance of shelling that harms natural resources – from national parks to forests and other environmental sites – is documented.”Such cases take a long time to investigate. Law enforcement often cannot access sites – many lie in combat zones, where most fires ignite, on mined land or in areas still under Russian occupation. The difficulty, Nikitin says, is establishing a cause-and-effect relationship proving that specific Russian military personnel were responsible for deliberately lit fires or targeting of emergency services.Anhelina Hrytsei, a researcher with the Ukrainian investigative group Truth Hounds, says reports of attacks on rescue workers intensified in 2024 and 2025. The precision of the weapons, absence of nearby military targets and repeated use of double-tap tactics point to deliberate targeting, she says.“If a small drone with a camera is used to attack rescue workers, and the operator can see them on site wearing insignia, then we can talk – if not about intent – at least about a failure to prevent harm.”View image in fullscreenTrying to put out a fire in Odessa in July 2024.Photograph: Larina Elena/AlamyAgriculture under threatMost large forest fires occur near active combat zones, where a variety of explosive objects litter the ground. Landmines and unexploded ordnance left from occupation or failed detonations can ignite in the heat, fuelling fires and making firefighting extremely dangerous.Russian forces also carry out remote mining, including anti-personnel mines known as “petals”, dropped from drones.“Once we demined this 8-hectare area near a road. A few days later, petals were already lying there,” says Skoryk. During hot, dry summers, the ammunition can heat and spontaneously detonate.The mines and ordnance also slow firefighting. In the frontline Izium Forestry, where about90% of the territoryremains mined, pyrotechnic units must inspect the area before crews can begin extinguishing.More than2 millionmines have been laid in Ukraine, making it one of the most mined countries in the world, and researchers say it will be difficult for the land to recover quickly.Chart showing how a third of Ukrainian land burned in 2024 was agricultural“Remaining mines and unexploded ordnances in forests along frontlines will prevent recovery and active reforestation of this land for a long time,” says Peter Potapov, a researcher at World Resource Institute’s Food, Forests and Water programme.Many of the country’s forests were planted and carefully managed alongside farmland, he says, to calm wind, hold snow and regulate water runoff. “Without these forests, the agricultural productivity may be reduced at the regional scale,” he says.View image in fullscreenWorkers at Sviati Hory national park dig firebreaks to try to contain the flames.Photograph: Thomas Peter/ReutersBiodiversity shatteredBurning at such enormous scale and intensity, the fires could have long-term effects on the biodiversity of Ukraine, scientists say. “War affects nature in a complex way – every part of the ecosystem suffers,” says ecologist Kateryna Polianska. “Some changes can be reversed, but others will not recover, or only with great difficulty.”In 2024, Polianska travelled to Sviati Hory national park and the Kreidova Flora department of the Ukrainian Steppe nature reserve, areas scarred by the war. There, relict chalk slopes – ancient formations created millions of years ago – were shattered by shelling. “We will no longer be able to reinforce them, put them up,” she says.These slopes once sheltered rare pine forests on chalk, recognised as an endangered habitat. Now, many forests lie burned, broken or stripped bare. Polianska warns that climate change makes recovery even harder: “It may take 70 or 80 years to see the same forest – if it recovers at all.”Chart showing how 2024 saw Ukrainian weather conditions that raised the wildfire riskFor Skoryk, the destruction is personal. The Kamianska Sich national park director lost his home when Russian forces occupied it in 2022 and he now lives in a basement on the park’s grounds. Despite everything, he refuses to leave.“This is my child, I created it – I have been the only director since the day it was founded,” Skoryk says. To him, the park is a life’s work, a place where rare species and fragile ecosystems depend on protection even under constant attack.Fires sparked by shelling regularly sweep through the park, threatening what remains. After the dust settles, craters maintain dangerous levels of heavy metals from explosives and toxins. Skoryk and his staff trained in mine clearance and continue to work on demining parts of the park whenever possible – between fires and after marked craters have been studied for measurements and samples.“If not us, who?” he says.This article is a collaboration between the Kyiv Independent and the Guardian’sAge ofextinctionandUkraine indepthreporting projectsExplore more on these topicsUkraine in depthUkraineWildfiresRussiaEuropefeaturesShareReuse this content"

According to US figures, at least nine attacks have now been carried out since early September, killing 37 people. A broad range of experts have said the campaign is illegal.“Colombia calls on the US government to cease these attacks and urges it to respect the norms dictated by international law,” the foreign ministry said in a statement on Wednesday evening.Gustavo Petro, the president,was more blunt,writing on social media: “It is murder. Whether in the Caribbean or Pacific, the US government strategy breaks the norms of international law.”US ‘Night Stalkers’ seen in Caribbean as fears of regime change rise in VenezuelaRead moreWashington initially said the campaign, launched on 2 September, was aimed at destroying cartels operating out of Venezuela. Donald Trump justified the attacks by claiming the US was in an “armed conflict” with narcotraffickers, while Nicolás Maduro accused him ofseeking regime change. The attacks have been accompanied by amajor US military buildupin the Caribbean, involving guided missile destroyers, F-35 fighter jets, a nuclear submarine and about 6,500 troops.The decision to extend operations into the Pacific – and the targeting of Colombian vessels – has further deepened tensions in the region and raised fears over what the US administration might do next.Elizabeth Dickinson, senior analyst at the International Crisis Group, said what initially began as a pressure campaign against Venezuela “is quickly spreading its tentacles across the rest of the region”.The attacks have further embittered relations between the US and Colombia, which have traditionally been close allies. The two countries have long shared intelligence to intercept cocaine shipments at sea and dismantle the criminal networks behind them. According to a government website, the US provided over $740m (£551m) in aid to Colombia in 2023.Trump responded to Petro’s comments by describing his Colombian counterpart as a “thug”, “a bad guy” and an “illegal drug trafficker”.chart of recent US attacks on vessels in Caribbean and PacificAnd the attacks have also drawn criticism from another Latin leader with uneasy relations with the US: Claudia Sheinbaum, the Mexican president who has worked with the Trump administration over border security and trade, also criticised the operations on Thursday. “Obviously we do not agree,” Sheinbaum said. “There are international laws on how to operate when dealing with the alleged illegal transport of drugs or guns on international waters.”Trump administration officials have framed the attacks, which have mostly targeted vessels near Venezuelan waters, as a counternarcotics operation. But they coincide with mounting US pressure on Maduro, Venezuela’s strongman leader, and Trump has publicly confirmedauthorising covert CIA operationswithin Venezuela.The US is facing its worst drug crisis in history, with roughly100,000 Americansdying each year from overdoses, mostly caused by fentanyl and other opioids. The synthetic drug is largely produced in labs in China and Mexico beforebeing smuggledinto the United States by its southern border.Colombia, by contrast, produces virtually no fentanyl but remains the world’s top cocaine supplier, with cultivation and production at record highs, according to theUnited Nations. The drug is mainly smuggled along the Pacific maritime corridor, before being handed to Mexican cartels, or moved overland to Ecuador, where it is shipped abroad in containers – often hidden among banana exports. About a quarter is also smuggled via the Caribbean, according to a2019 reportby the US Drug Enforcement Administration.Ecuador itself produces no cocaine but has become a key transit hub in recent years, also receiving shipments from Peru and Bolivia. A small share is moved by clandestine flights,often routed through Venezuela, to Mexico or Central America.Even if the US is correct that the targeted vessels were carrying drugs, “these would be low-level traffickers, the least of the least within the organisation”, said Dickinson. “Attacking them would have little or no material effect on the actual trafficking of drugs to the United States or elsewhere,” she added.A mid-September attack killed a Colombian fisherman called Alejandro Carranza, Petro and the man’s family said. “Why did they just take his life like that?” asked Katerine Hernández, Carranza’s wife, who also denied that he was a drug trafficker.Trumpsuggested on Wednesdaythat he would soon order strikes against land targets, saying that the attacks had driven smugglers on to land routes. He added that he would “probably go back to Congress and explain exactly what we are doing” beforehand.“We will hit them very hard when they come in by land,” Trump said. “They haven’t experienced that yet, but now we are totally prepared to do that.”Explore more on these topicsColombiaAmericasUS immigrationnewsShareReuse this content"

And I’m going to run for a fourth term inBrazil,” announced Lula, who celebrates his birthday on Monday.Even as he approaches 80, Lula remains by far the most influential figure on the Brazilian left – a status the former union leader has enjoyed for the last 40 years. If elected, he would be 85 by the time he finishes his fourth term and would have become the only democratically elected Brazilian president to have spent 16 years in power.Joe Biden’s disastrous 2024 re-election campaign, which the 81-year-old president was forced to abandon after an excruciating debate with Donald Trump, left some Brazilian voters fretting over the wisdom of an octogenarian Lula seeking another term.Brazil’s president says in UN speech that democracy can prevail over ‘would-be autocrats’Read moreBut Fernando Morais, Lula’s biographer and friend, insisted Brazil’s gym-going president was fit as a fiddle and sharp as a tack and hadn’t smoked a single cigarette since quitting after overcoming throat cancer nearly 15 years ago.“He’s not Joe Biden … I’ve never seen him suffer a memory lapse, neither in public nor in private when it’s just the two of us chatting … He’s someone who has astounding physical energy, not to mention the energy of his soul,” Morais said, showing off as proof a photograph of Lula taking a swipe at a punchbag with his red boxing gloves.The Brazilian writer, who travelled around the world with Lula while researching his biography, recalled how the pair once spent 23 hours flying back to Brazil from India, with a layover in Mozambique. “When we landed … I was a total wreck – a corpse – and I said: ‘OK, President, let’s go home and get some kip,’” Morais said. “But he said: ‘No, I’m off to Taubaté [a city in São Paulo] because I’ve got a rally to do there to help one of our candidates.’”“It’s unbelievable,” Morais added. “He’s one of those people who hardly needs to sleep. Four or five hours and he’s fine.”Lula first ran for elected office in 1982 and launched his first (unsuccessful) presidential campaign in 1989 before eventually winning power in 2002 and becoming his country’s first working-class president.The leftwing veteran appears well-placed to win next October’s election, with Brazil’s right currently in disarray after its most important leader, Bolsonaro, was sentenced to 27 years in prison for trying to stop Lula taking power with a military coup. Would-be successors are jostling to fill Bolsonaro’s shoes but polls suggest Lula would beat all of them.Lula’s hopes of claiming a fourth term have been boosted bya cack-handed campaign by the Trump administrationto help Bolsonaro avoid jail by hitting Brazil with 50% tariffs and sanctioning officials. That pressure failed to save Bolsonaro’s skin and gave Lula a bump in the polls.Trump recentlyextended an olive branch to the Brazilian president, saying he “seemed like a very nice man”, and the pair are expected to meet in Malaysia this weekend.Morais said he believed that if the 2026 election were held today, “Lula would win in the first round”.“I’m convinced his fourth term will be his best term of all and it will be the term that allows him to enter history through the front door,” he said.Not everyone is so convinced the 2026 vote will be a cakewalk.Celso Rocha de Barros​, the author ofa recent bookabout Lula’s Workers’ party (PT), saw its leader as the slight favourite. “But the election is still completely open,” he added.Barros predicted a tight race against the most likely rightwing candidate, the São Paulo governor and former Bolsonaro minister Tarcísio de Freitas, who would probably receive “the wholesale support​ of the political and economic elites”.In a recent interview, Guilherme Boulos, a 43-year-old politician widely considered to be one of Lula’s most promising heirs, warned that the election would be a bitter fight between Lula and whoever inherited Bolsonaro’s votes. “In the last election Lula only beat Bolsonaro by 2m votes … [and] the country remains polarised. It will be a tough, difficult election. And I don’t doubt that the major internet platforms and big techs will act directly to favour the far-right candidate.“It’s going to be war,” added Boulos, whom Lula this week made a minister and gave orders to roam South America’s largest country to mobilise support.Explore more on these topicsLuiz Inácio Lula da SilvaBrazilAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

        "Content": "Illustration: Guardian DesignClaim that Tren de Aragua planned to attack officers was widely shared – only for FBI to later acknowledge it was mistaken, internal files showBySam Levinin Los AngelesThu 23 Oct 2025 07.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 23 Oct 2025 11.05 EDTShareAn unverified rumor that Venezuelan gang members were preparing to kill police officers spread like wildfire through US law enforcement agencies last year, internal records reveal, only for federal officials to later quietly acknowledge the claim was mistaken.The intelligence report, which appears to have first been disseminated by a local New Mexico police department in July 2024, suggested that the Tren de Aragua (TdA) gang had directed its members to “fire on or attack” law enforcement. The vague assertion quickly traveled among law enforcement agencies. It even made its way into a formal proclamation by the Texas governor, Greg Abbott, and was repeated by Republican Congress members as evidence of the dangers of Venezuelan immigrants and Democrats’ border policies.Months later, however, the Federal Bureau of Investigation wrote in an internal report that claims of a TdA “directive to actively target US law enforcement” were inaccurate.There has been no public acknowledgment of misstatements.The documents were uncovered byProperty of the People, a government transparency non-profit, which has maderecords requestsrelated to US authorities’discussions of TdAand shared files with the Guardian.The records, TdA experts said, suggested that a wide range of powerful law enforcement agencies lacked a basic understanding about the gang and its operations.In recent months, the stakes of dubious and alarmist claims about TdA have become increasingly high. Trump’s administration hascarried outsevenlethal strikesonvesselsnear Venezuela, in some cases claiming the military was targeting TdA members,withoutproviding concrete evidence, and United Nations experts havesaidthe attacks violated international law. The Department of Homeland Security has also used unsubstantiated claims of TdA affiliation todeportVenezuelans,without due process, to anotorious El Salvador prison– and has moved torevoke the legal statusof roughly 600,000 Venezuelan immigrants.TdAbegan in a prisonin the Venezuelan state of Aragua, and experts say there is no evidence the group has a clearly organized structure in the US,strongly rejectingclaims of an “invasion”. Allegations of a TdA call to attack police were especially far-fetched, scholars said.But the narrative, records show, quickly took hold.‘Green light to attack law enforcement’The rumor about TdA threats to US police was first documented on 27 July 2024 by the Albuquerque police department (APD) in New Mexico. In an “Officer Safety/Awareness” bulletin distributed to local law enforcement partners, APD cited warnings from Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), which conducts investigations for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).“[Albuquerque] HSI has received information from credible human sources out of Colorado that the Tren De Aragua criminal organization operating in Denver have been given a ‘green light’ to fire on or attack law enforcement,” APD wrote in a one-page bulletin. “Due to the access of these informants this intelligence is believed to be credible at this time.” HSI in New York had also received this information, APD said, encouraging its officers to “remain vigilant”.The bulletin provided no further detail.On 28 July, the day after the APD alert, Customs and Border Protection (CBP) issued a warning about HSI’s “green light” report, telling agents to “maintain a heightened sense of awareness” and “always wear their body armor”. The one-page alert said CBP had encountered a total of “approximately 26 known/identified TdA members” in fiscal year 2024.The next day, DHS warned of the alleged TdA threat to officers in an email to state and local agencies, which the National Sheriffs’ Association shared with its members across the US. A sheriff’s official in Santa Barbara, California, then forwarded the report to others in his office, writing: “Obviously we’re not in Denver or New York but who’s to say there aren’t associated members in our county.”A 31 July New York police department alert acknowledged the “green light” warning and said it believed TdA members in Venezuela had shot at police when fleeing. But NYPD’s intelligence bureau, the alert said, “notes that this does not indicate TdA will target uniformed officers without prior engagement”.Still, in the following weeks, the APD and CBP “green light” warnings were shared by the New York State Intelligence Center, a multi-agency counter-terrorism group; US army north, the domestic defense command; the Major County Sheriffs of America, an association of agencies; the San Diego sheriff’s department; the Northwest High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area (HIDTA) program, working with law enforcement in Washington state; and the International Union of Police Associations, a lobbying group.It’s unclear if the agencies and groups took steps to confirm the rumor’s veracity or relevance to their networks.Internal emails from Washington state show a Kirkland police department analyst sought to “vet the info” with the state’s “fusion center”, a consortium of agencies. A fusion center analyst responded that the FBI was not aware of any TdA presence in Washington. A Kirkland spokesperson said this week the department took no further actions.Gilbert Gallegos, an Albuquerque police spokesperson, said in an interview that APD disseminated the “green light” warning to its local partners and did not intend for it to be publicly shared. His recollection was, at the time of the bulletin, there had been a local homicide involving a Venezuelan suspect and victim, but, “I don’t know that it had any kind of gang connection other than they were from Venezuela.”Gallegos said he was not aware of any evidence of a TdA presence in his region and APD had no intelligence about potential Venezuelan gang attacks on police beyond what an HSI agent in Colorado had shared. Still, he said, “if there was something that threatened law enforcement, we definitely wanted our officers to know about it.”‘Unverified and inflammatory’Conservative news outlets, includingFox Newsand theNew York Post, along withNewsNation, reported on the alleged TdA threats, citing the Albuquerque and CBP “green light” memos.Governor Abbott, a staunch Trump supporter, cited the “‘green light’ to fire on … law enforcement” in a September 2024 Texas proclamation calling TdA a “terrorist organization” andcondemningJoe Biden’s “open-border policies”. His public safety directorcalledTdA members “cockroaches”.The then Colorado congressman Greg Lopez, a Republican, used the rumor to attack Biden’s DHS secretary, condemning “calls for brazen violence against our nation’s police officers”, claiming DHS had “chosen not to act”. Senator Ted Cruz cited the “green light” quote in a letter to DHS, saying a “massive increase in crime committed by Venezuelan illegal aliens is a direct result of this administration’s purposeful policies”.It wasn’t until several months later that federal officials cast doubt on the narrative.In December, the FBI and army’s National Ground Intelligence Center held a TdA briefing in Seattle and shared follow-up materials with officials from Washington, Oregon, Alaska, the US Bureau of Prisons, DHS, the Drug Enforcement Administration and other agencies, email records show.The materials included warnings thatcertain tattoos and emojiscould be signs of TdA affiliation –claimsthat experts have said were “ludicrous” and “baseless”.In a section on “officer safety”, the FBI summarized TdA’s “history of targeting, extorting and/or recruiting law enforcement” outside of the US, but then said: “Despite reporting in August 2024 indicating TdA issued a ‘green light’ on violence against US law enforcement, it appears the order is primarily defensive in nature, rather than a directive to actively target US law enforcement.”View image in fullscreenThe Texas governor Gregg Abbott signs a proclamation last month declaring Tren de Aragua a terrorist group.Photograph: Houston Chronicle/Hearst Newspapers/Getty ImagesThe FBI did not respond to inquiries.Tricia McLaughlin, DHS assistant secretary, said in an email: “Any effort by the Guardian to smear law enforcement intelligence or downplay the threat that Tren de Aragua poses to our country is disgraceful and absurd.”McLaughlin said last year’s “be on the lookout” alert was created by local law enforcement, “and out of an abundance of caution for the safety of law enforcement, HSI Denver created a similar one”. Colorado officials also publicly acknowledged the alert, she said.“Information sharing is a critical aspect of law enforcement,” she said. She noted Trump had designated TdA a foreign terrorist organization, saying the president and DHS secretary, Kristi Noem, “will not allow foreign terrorist enemies to operate in our country and endanger Americans”.Gallegos, the Albuquerque spokesperson, said he was not aware of the FBI’s correction. He said APD officials were troubled last year to see how far its bulletin had spread: “There was some concern that it could become politicized and I think it did.” His city “has an inclusive attitude towards immigration” and APD tries “not to paint everyone with a broad stroke and inflame tensions”, he said, but “our overriding concern was officer safety” and APD could not control what other agencies did with its report.A CBP spokesperson did not respond to detailed questions about its “green light” report, saying in an email: “CBP is working closely with all of our federal partners, sharing information, to make sure that law enforcement personnel can do their jobs safely.”A Denver police (DPD) spokesperson said the department “monitored and made officers aware of the safety concerns” raised by the “green light” reports, but said “there were no direct threats made to DPD officers”.Megan Noland, executive director of the Major County Sheriffs, said in an email: “As we do whenever we receive threat information that is deemed credible, we forwarded that information to our members. Our member agencies continue to monitor any important intelligence related to TdA.” An HIDTA spokesperson said it “had no original or unique information” about the threat and was sharing warnings that had been publicly posted.Spokespeople for the other agencies and politicians that shared the report did not respond to inquiries.Ryan Shapiro, executive director of Property of the People, said the records showed “this unverified, inflammatory mischaracterization fueled an ever-escalating game of law enforcement telephone”.“This is typical. Thinly sourced intelligence products get repackaged as new security reports, receive coverage from rightwing media, and then get funneled back into additional law enforcement alerts,” Shapiro said. “It’s a self-reinforcing ecosystem of politically motivated distortion and paranoia.”‘Real consequences’Scholars on Tren de Aragua said the notion that TdA members in the US would have a directive to kill police was incongruent with the group’s operations.Rebecca Hanson, professor at the University of Florida’s Center for Latin American Studies, who has interviewed police in Venezuela about TdA, said while there have been armed confrontations between the gang and police, there was no evidence of TdA ordering attacks on Venezuelan officers: “There is not a single case of Tren de Aragua using that policy in Venezuela. It is not a part of their playbook.”Hanson, who reviewed the records for the Guardian, said gangs, generally, would only order attacks on police under specific and limited circumstances, since broad and random violence against the state could be a costly strategy that hurts their economic interests.TdA in particular is decentralized, and there was no evidence of any formal hierarchy or leadership in the US, she said.“So where is this ‘green light’ coming from? Ostensibly, it would be from someone high up giving the order to lower-ranking members. But Tren de Aragua isn’t organized that way … It would seem very strange for Tren de Aragua to have never done this before and then start in the US.”Hanson said she was also highly skeptical of the FBI’s claim that there was a call for “defensive” violence against police. The FBI’s own report, she noted, acknowledged “gaps” in its knowledge with a list of unanswered questions, including: “Who are the TdA leaders that direct or sanction activities within or outside of the United States and where are they located?”; “What are TdA’s rules of order … for conducting criminal activity within the United States?”; and “How autonomous are TdA subsets from TdA leadership?”Without answers to those questions, the FBI could not credibly make any claims about TdA directives, Hanson said: “It very much worries me about the type of information they are looking for and confirming before making these very bombastic claims … It makes me wonder how much police departments care about testing the veracity of these claims.”Phil Gunson, a Caracas-based analyst for Crisis Group, an international NGO, said it seemed “completely implausible” that any purported TdA members in the US would be in a position to give orders, or would have an incentive to call for police killings.Gunson said he was concerned about the impact of these “exaggerated, cartoonish” claims about TdA: “You can trace a direct line from this narrative that bolsters the case that TdA is a nationwide terrorist organization to these clearly unlawful efforts by theTrump administrationto demonize and even kill Venezuelans on the basis that they are TdA.”There is a long history of US officials falsely painting immigrant groups as criminal and violent to justify crackdowns on migration, said Deep Gulasekaram, professor of constitutional and immigration law at the University of Colorado, noting how propaganda about the dangers of Chinese immigrants, including claims that they threatened white women, was used to justify the Chinese exclusion act in the late 1800s.“It is so easy in this country to sell a story about immigrant danger, and the claims have such staying power,” he said, notingno studyhad ever credibly found a link between immigration and crime. “It’s amazing how fast falsehoods about noncitizens and their danger will make its way through every media channel.”That dynamic, he said,played out in Coloradolast September when there were reports that TdA had “taken over” an apartment complex in the city of Aurora, claims police officials ultimatelysaidwere false. Still, Trump, on thecampaign trail, said: “Venezuelans are taking over the whole town, they’re taking over buildings.”Lisa Martinez, University of Denver sociology professor, watched as rumors about TdA controlling Aurora spread among her neighbors in online forums: “People really bought into these tropes and the story took on a life of its own … The irony was if one really wanted to see what was happening, you could go to Aurora and see [that] these activities were not happening.”She said she was increasingly concerned about misinformation leading to racial profiling: “A lot of these rumors and sentiments are false, but part of what makes it so dangerous is that it can have very real consequences for people who become afraid to go to work, to send their children to school, to live in their communities. People start to feel targeted, and sometimes they are.”Explore more on these topicsUS immigrationVenezuelaAmericasUS policingTrump administrationRepublicansnewsShareReuse this content"

They came on top of at least seven other strikes in the Caribbean that have killed at least 32 people and raised tensions with Colombia and Venezuela.Hegseth released a brief video of the Tuesday night strike, showing a small boat, half-filled with brown packages, moving along at sea. Several seconds into the video, the boat explodes and is seen floating motionless in flames.In a post on social media, Hegseth took the unusual step of equating the alleged drug traffickers to the terror group that conducted the attacks on the US on September 11, 2001.“Just as al-Qaida waged war on our homeland, these cartels are waging war on our border and our people,” Hegseth said, adding that “there will be no refuge or forgiveness – only justice”.The Colombian president, Gustavo Petro, who is in the midst of a spat with Donald Trump over the boat strikes and tariffs, said: “The attack on another boat in the Pacific … killed people. It is murder. Whether in theCaribbeanor Pacific, the US government strategy breaks the norms of international law.”Venezuela is a major drug transit zone, but the eastern Pacific Ocean, not the Caribbean, is the primary area for smuggling cocaine.In striking boats in the Pacific, the administration widened the scope of its campaign, although the reasons for the expansion were not immediately clear. The White House did not respond to a request for comment and Hegseth gave no additional details other than the video on X.Trump announced what appears to have been the first strike on a boat on 3 September, releasing a brief video of the attack.Since then, the Trump administration has detailed more strikes without disclosing many details about the targets other than the number of people killed, and the allegation that the boats carried narcotics. The attacks have prompted widespread condemnation, from civil liberties groups and South American countries.On Tuesday the Guardian revealed that theCentral Intelligence Agency(CIA) is providing the bulk of the intelligence used to carry out the airstrikes. Experts say the agency’s central role means much of the evidence used to select the targets will almost certainly remain secret.The US presidentconfirmedlast Wednesday that he had authorised covert CIA action in Venezuela, but not what the agency would be doing. The US has deployed an extraordinary military presence off the country’s coast.White House officials have tried to justify the increasing number of strikes with a dubious legal theory that claims the boats are affiliated with “designated terrorist organisations” with which the US was now in a “non-international armed conflict”, the Guardian has reported.Until this month, the administration has referred to Tren de Aragua and other cartels as foreign terrorist organisations, or FTOs. Legal experts suggested that simply characterising drugs cartels as FTOs did not give the administration any additional authority to use lethal force.White House officials have also sought to justify the strikes internally and externally by claiming Trump was exercising his article two powers, which allow the president to use military force in self-defence in limited engagements.The self-defence argument revolves around Trump’s designation of Tren de Aragua as an FTO, a claim advanced by Stephen Miller, Trump’s deputy chief of staff, in order to defend the deportations of dozens of Venezuelans earlier this year under the Alien Enemies Act.The administration claimed that Tren de Aragua had infiltrated the regime of the Venezuelan president, Nicolás Maduro – and so the presence of the cartel’s members in the US amounted to a “predatory incursion” by a foreign nation, allowing for the deportation of any Venezuelan national.But the administration has yet to provide concrete evidence that Tren de Aragua has become an instrument of the Venezuelan government, and legal experts said the White House could only justify the strikes if it could make that showing.The strikes on alleged Venezuelan drug boats have largely been overseen by Miller and Tony Salisbury, his top lieutenant at the White House homeland security council (HSC),the Guardian has previously reported.Miller empowered the HSC earlier this year to become its own entity in Trump’s second term, a notable departure from previous administrations where it was considered part of the national security council and ultimately reported to the national security adviser.That was the case, for instance, with the second Venezuelan boat hit with hellfire missiles on 15 September. While the White House was informed that the Pentagon had identified the boat as a viable target more than four days before, many top White House officials only learned of the impending strike hours before it happened.Reuters contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsUS militaryCaribbeanAmericasPete HegsethColombianewsShareReuse this content"

While each union has demands specific to their sector, the complaints were broadly consistent: inadequate pay, unsafe staffing levels, not enough resources, and poor working conditions that put the wellbeing of workers, patients and children at risk.“We fear for the safety of our patients,” Noreen McCallan, a nurse in Hawke’s Bay, said in a statement. “Staff shortages have become overwhelming and exhausting for many of us. Our patients are suffering longer because we can’t get to them as quickly as we should.”A teacher in Palmerston North, Liam Rutherford, said there needed to be “serious investment in education, not just tinkering around the edges”.“The current offer from the government won’t help us in recruiting new teachers and keeping the ones we currently have.

Schools are alsofacing staffing shortfalls.At the same time, the government hasslashed funding for public servicesin its hope to grow the economy and cancelleddozens of pay equity claims.Meanwhile, citizens areleaving the country in record numbers, the majority of whom are moving to Australia for more job opportunities and better pay, including in education and healthcare.Today’s planned strikes are unnecessary and politically motivated by the unions. Workers’ pay claims will only be settled by negotiation, and the Government is ready to talk.— NZ National Party (@NZNationalParty)October 22, 2025The coalition government has been hostile towards the protest, with the prime minister, Christopher Luxon,dismissing it as “politically motivated”and senior ministers for education, health and public services calling it “unfair, unnecessary and unproductive”.The government was “at the table with offers” while the unions were “out on the street with megaphones”, the public service minister, Judith Collins, said in a statement.She said the strike was a “a stunt” targeting government, in which thousands of patients and children would pay the price.Many schools closed on Thursday due to the strike, while heath providers reduced non-essential services. Despite the disruptions, public support for the strike is favourable. ATalbot Mills pollsuggested 65% of the public backed the strike, and nearly half of those who voted for the coalition government were also in favour.Opposition parties backed the strike, with the Labour leader, Chris Hipkins, laying responsibility for the industrial action on the prime minister.“Luxon is out of touch and making our health and education systems worse,” Hipkins said in a statement.“He has made his priorities clear: handing out massive pay rises to boardroom directors and millions to tobacco companies, instead of investing in the services we all rely on.”Explore more on these topicsNew ZealandNew Zealand politicsAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

He finally her told her the truth in 2018.On one occasion, in 2015, he had sex with her. This occurred a year after the spycops inquiry had beencommissioned by the UK governmentto scrutinise allegations of misconduct by undercover officers who infiltrated political movements.One of the key issues in front of the inquiry is how for decades the undercover officers haveregularly formed sexual relationshipswith women without disclosing that they had adopted fake personas and had been sent to spy on political activists.Thomson, who infiltrated animal rights campaigners between 1997 and 2002, is set to be questioned next month by the inquiry, which has said there were “very many troubling aspects” to his deployment.Earlier this month, David Barr, the inquiry’s chief barrister, said Thomson “has, on his own admission, told many lies to date. He has lied not only to those he mixed with while deployed but also to his managers and to the inquiry.”Among the allegations he will face are that he fabricated claims that an animal rights activist was seeking a gun to take revenge on a political opponent, developed a second fake identity without the authorisation of his Metropolitan police superiors, and broke the law while obtaining multiple identity documents.Thomson was forced to admit to the inquiry that he had deceived two women into sexual relationships while undercover after initially denying this.Ellie described how Thomson washer first real love and serious boyfriend. She was a “a particularly young and naive 21-year-old” when she started the relationship in 2001. He told her he was 33 when he was actually 36.She was “devastated and really heartbroken” when he said he needed to move to America in 2002 to be near his children and his ex-partner. This was a ruse as he was actually ending his undercover deployment.Afterwards, Ellie and Thomson stayed in regular touch for more than a decade as they maintained relations that were “intimate, loving and romantic in nature … there was always sexual attraction and intimacy in our interactions … every time we met it was like being on a date,” she said.“In hindsight all of these ongoing interactions meant it was very difficult to ever get over him and move on. He has been the one that ‘got away’, if you will, and no one has compared.”She said she had still not been able to fully process his deception and had been left with a “deep mistrust of those who I previously believed were there to protect society as a whole”.“I despise being some sort of victim. I hate that I was gullible and so naive, but seeing what the Metropolitan police are like nowadays, I am no longer surprised that they never even considered we were worth basic respect. I hate the amount of tears I have shed over this as it makes me feel pathetic,” she said.In 2005, Ellie moved to Australia with her friend, an animal rights activist known as Wendy, who also testified on Thursday that Thomson had deceived her. She had been friends with him for 21 years without him disclosing his real identity. “The depth of the intrusion into every aspect of my life is unbelievable,”she said.Last week a woman who was deceived by Thomson into a year-long intimate relationship testified. The woman,known as Sara, described how she fell in love with him after meeting him in 1998, believing him to beher soulmate, and would have married him if he had asked.Explore more on these topicsPoliceSpycops scandalnewsShareReuse this content"

Trump can’t simply willAukusinto being.Of course, Aukus has always been as much a political agreement as a military one.Desperately seeking submariners: why keeping nuclear-powered boats afloat will be Australia’s biggest Aukus challengeRead moreAustralia’s political class has taken great succour from thefiercely supportive wordsfrom the current US president this week – “really moving along really rapidly, very well … full steam ahead” – but the practicalities, and the black letters of the Aukus legislation (not to mention the 22nd amendment), cannot be ignored.If the US constitution is to be relied upon at all, Trump cannot be in office in 2031 when the decision will be taken whether or not to sell Australia a Virginia-class boat.The US constitution is clear: presidents are limited to two terms of office. Trump’s second will expire at midday on 20 January 2029.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailEqually clear is thelegislation passed by the US Congress: not later than 270 days before any boat is sold to Australia in 2032, the US commander-in-chief – the president of the day – must certify that America relinquishing a submarine “will not degrade the United States undersea capabilities”.The US fleet currently has only three-quarters of the submarines it needs (49 boats of a force-level goal of 66). The US navy estimates it needs to be building Virginia-class submarines at a rate of two per year to meet its own defence requirements, and about2.33 to have enough boats to sell any to Australia. It is currently building Virginia-class submarines at a rate of about1.13 a year, senior admirals say.If the US navy needs the submarine, it cannot be sold to Australia, regardless of how much the president might wish it. Despite the injection of billions of Australian dollars into America’s ailing shipbuilding industry, this fundamental condition appears increasingly impossible to meet.4:09Key moments from Albanese and Trump's White House meeting – videoBeyond the sclerotic rates of shipbuilding in the US, myriad complexities are still unaddressed.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Will they meet Australia’s defence needs when they arrive – theapex predator of today’s oceans, the prey of tomorrow’s technologies?Where will thehigh-level nuclear wastethey produce go? It will be toxic for millennia and a security risk.More than two years ago, the defence minister promised that theprocess for establishing a nuclear waste siteon defence land “current or future” would be publicly revealed “within 12 months”. There has been nothing since.Legislation also prohibits the US from transferring a submarine to Australia if Australia has not demonstrated the “domestic capacity to fully perform all the … activities necessary for the safe hosting and operation of nuclear-powered submarines”.Promises of fealty to the deal might make for good politics, but they are only meaningful when they reflect something approximating reality.Aukus faces monumental, perhaps insurmountable, hurdles.

In one case, the fang of a blunt-nosed viper (Macrovipera lebetina) snapped and went flying. “That was quite dramatic, obviously,” Evans said.“This is likely how fang loss during feeding most often occurs, but this is the first time it has been caught on camera,” the researchers noted in the paper.“Fangs have previously been found in snake scats, which means fangs often break off during prey penetration, remain stuck in the prey and are swallowed by the snake.”View image in fullscreenWounds in the gel target from a colubrid snake using its rear fangs to slice.Photograph: Silke CleurenThe loss of individual fangs was not a problem, Evans said. “They’re replaced – the snakes make new fangs throughout their life.”Evans said the findings on how different snake species strike would add to “information about their conservation and protection”.“Only by knowing their diet and hunting methods can we be confident in that we’re going to put forward protection schemes that are going to be successful.”The study’s lead author, Dr Silke Cleuren, who is also of Monash University, tested the snakes at Venomworld, a venom production institution on the outskirts of Paris.Dr Alessandro Palci of Flinders University, who was not involved in the study, said the research “fills gaps in our knowledge of snakes’ striking behaviour”.“The differences in behaviour that have been reported for viperids, elapids, and colubrids correlate well with what we know about their fang anatomy,” he said.Explore more on these topicsSnakesWildlifeReptilesAnimalsAnimal behaviournewsShareReuse this content"

The reparation loan remains an option, but is less likely to be ready early next year as Ukraine had hoped.Earlier on Thursday Zelenskyy urged leaders to take this “great” decision to fund Ukraine’s defence as soon as possible.Putin says he will never bow to US but concedes sanctions may cause ‘some losses’Read more“Anyone who delays this decision is not only limiting our defence but also slowing down your own progress,” he told EU leaders, promising that Ukraine would spend a lot of money buying European weapons. “The time to act on Russian assets is now and I urge for your full support.”The European Commission hopes to use the assets at Euroclear as the basis for a €140bn (£122bn) loan to Ukraine, which would only be repaid once Russia paid compensation for the war.Officials believe they have found a way of making Russia pay for its war without confiscating the assets or breaching property rights.The Kremlin says the scheme is theft and has vowed to pursue any individual or country deemed to have taken Russian money.Leaders need the agreement of Belgium, which hosts €183bn of Russian central bank assets at Euroclear – 86% of all Russian state assets in the EU and two-thirds of the worldwide total.Belgium’s prime minister, Bart De Wever, said the biggest problem was how to guarantee that the cash was available immediately if something went wrong.Arriving at the summit earlier on Thursday, he threatened to oppose the plan without guarantees that the rest of the EU would cover the cost if Russia came looking for its money.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We want guarantees if the money has to be paid back that every member state will chip in. The consequences cannot only be for Belgium,” he said.EU leaders tried to meet his concerns with a promise of “burden sharing and coordination” with the G7, but it was not enough to secure an agreement.About one-third of Russian state assets are held outside the EU, including in Japan (€28bn), the UK (€27bn), Canada (€15bn) and the US (€4bn). While the UK and Canada are expected to make similar moves, EU officials are less hopeful about the US, which holds a small but symbolic amount of Russian state assets.The loan plan remains on the table, with many unanswered questions. It depends on EU unanimity to keep Russian assets frozen for a long time. Hungary’s Russia-friendly government has frequently delayed EU sanctions and, although it has never dared to block them, its anti-Ukraine rhetoric raises questions about its future support.Hungary’s prime minister, Viktor Orbán, skipped the discussions on Ukraine to attend events in Budapestcommemorating the 1956 Hungarian revolution, which was crushed by Soviet repression. As now customary, the EU adopted a statement of support for Ukraine – including future financing – without Hungary’s backing.Earlier in the day, the EU agreed its 19th package of sanctions against Russia,targeting liquefied natural gasfor the first time. The move came soon after the US imposed sanctions on Russia’s two largest oil companies, Rosneft and Lukoil, the first restrictive measures passed by the Trump administration.Latvia’s prime minister, Evika Siliņa, said an agreement on the loan would strengthen Zelenskyy in any peace talks with Putin. “I believe [Zelenskyy] will be much stronger to enter those negotiations if those negotiations take place,” she said.Ireland’s taoiseach, Micheál Martin, said his government supported the plan and did not see any implications for Irish neutrality.“This cannot be a repeating cycle where … big countries feel, like Russia, they can go in and destroy a place and expect other people to pay for the reconstruction afterwards,” he said.Zelenskyy expressed hope that the US would eventually supplylong-range Tomahawk missiles. “It was like sanctions: before it was unbelievable and now we see the decisions on these energy sanctions, which are very important,” he said.But he downplayed reports of a 12-point peace plan that emerged earlier this week, suggesting it was the work of “some very good friends” seeking to pre-empt “some plan from Russia” promoted by another country that he did not name.The plan, which was first reported by Bloomberg, called for a ceasefire, prisoner exchanges and the creation of a peace board chaired by Donald Trump – taking inspiration from the US administration’s Gaza plan.Zelenskyy said Russia showed no sign of wanting to stop the war, citing therecent bombing of a kindergarten. “More pressure on Russia and they will sit and speak and I think this is the plan,” he said.Explore more on these topicsUkraineVolodymyr ZelenskyyEuropean UnionEuropeRussianewsShareReuse this content"

He said the plant’s Russian occupiers had wanted to “make a gift” to Putin but the guerrilla operation on 6 October prevented that from taking place.On 7 October, Yevgeny Balitsky, the Russian-appointed governor of the occupied Zaporzhzhia region, reported power cuts across “all settlements” in the area after what he described as a terrorist attack by enemy drones.Prior to its reconnection, the nuclear power plant had been relying on backup diesel generators to supply electricity necessary for cooling for a period well beyond the standard three-day safety limit, after the 750kv line wascut on 23 September.Although the six reactors are in a state of cold shutdown, without constant cooling they would risk eventually overheating over a period of weeks, prompting warnings of a slow-motion Fukushima-style nuclear disaster.“Thirty days after the complete loss of external power supply, electricity supply has been resumed,” the Russian administrators of the site announced, saying it had been done afterUkraineagreed to a temporary local ceasefire brokered by the International Atomic Energy Agency.Soon afterwards, the IAEA confirmed that the reconnection had been completed. Rafael Grossi, the director general of the nuclear safety watchdog, said: “Today is a rare good day for nuclear safety and security in Ukraine and beyond, although the overall situation of course remains highly precarious.”Ukraine and independent experts haveaccused Russiaof deliberately damaging the high-voltage line last month to provoke a crisis so that it could reconnect the power station to the Russian grid instead.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Its reactors were gradually put into shutdown for safety reasons but Russia has indicated it would like to restart at least some of the reactors.A technical paper submitted by Russia to the IAEA on 3 June said that in the event of the external power lines to the plant being disconnected from Ukraine, “a procedure for voltage transmission … from the unified power system of Russia” had “been developed”.In September, Alexey Likhachev, the director general of Rosatom, the Russian nuclear energy corporation, told Russian television he had “repeatedly reported” to Putin that the company was ready to restart generating electricity first “to our territories” but also potentially to Ukraine “if, of course, the conditions arise”.The nuclear power plant has featured in peace talks involving Donald Trump and Putin, but while at one point Trump said he hoped the US would take over the running of the site, the Kremlin has made it clear it regards it as Russian.Explore more on these topicsRussiaUkraineEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

The 26-year-old suspect has appeared in court but cannot be named.Ch Supt Michael McNulty said on Thursday that police plan to keep a continuous presence at the complex over the next week and that units with riot gear, dogs, horses and a water cannon are on standby.Four gardaí have been treated in hospital for injuries during clashes with crowds who hurled rocks, bottles and other missiles.Protesters have displayed Irish flags, chanted anti-immigration slogans and charged police lines with horse-drawn carts and scrambler bikes.A police helicopter was targeted with lasers. The taoiseach, Micheál Martin, has condemned what he called the “violent disorder” and “vile abuse” against police.Demonstrations against asylum seekers and refugees have become common inIrelandin recent years, with protesters accusing the arrivals of worsening a housing shortage and driving violent crime.

The policy of President Trump is that the West Bank will not be annexed. This will always be our policy.”0:50'Stupid political stunt': Vance criticises Knesset vote to annex West Bank – videoOn Thursday afternoon, Ofir Katz, the chair of Israel’s coalition government, said Netanyahu had instructed him not to advance bills pertaining to annexation, and Netanyahu’s office said Wednesday’s vote had been a “deliberate political provocation” that aimed to sow division during Vance’s visit.The US secretary of state,Marco Rubio, landed in Israel on Thursday, becoming the latest in a string of US officials to visit the country to shore up the Gaza ceasefire. He described any plan to extend Israeli sovereignty over the occupied Palestinian territory as “potentially threatening for the peace deal”.“They’re a democracy, they’re going to have their votes, and people are going to take these positions,” Rubio said. “But at this time, it’s something that we … think might be counterproductive.”Washington has repeatedly said that any annexation of the West Bankwould cross a red line. In an interview published on Thursday in Time magazine, Trump said: “It won’t happen because I gave my word to the Arab countries … Israel would lose all of its support from the United States if that happened.”Israeli media has referred to the nonstop parade of American officials visiting to ensure Israel holds up its side of the fragile ceasefire as “Bibi-sitting”. The term, utilising Netanyahu’s nickname of Bibi, refers to an old campaign ad when Netanyahu positioned himself as the “Bibi-sitter” whom voters could trust with their kids.The preliminary passage of the bills had embarrassed Netanyahu, who had asked lawmakers to delay their presentation and, when that failed, urged MPs from his Likud party to abstain.Shouting erupted in the Knesset during the vote. Avi Maoz, a member of the far-right Noam party, declared: “The time has come to apply sovereignty,” insisting Israelis had a duty to “settle in the land of Israel”.Some in Trump’s administration previously backed Israel’s goal of annexing the West Bank. But the mood has shifted as several Arab and Islamic states – whose support Washington is seeking to help fund and staff a postwar stabilisation force in Gaza – have voiced strong opposition to any annexation.In a joint statement reported on Thursday, more than a dozen Muslim and Arab states condemned the bills as “a blatant violation of international law”.View image in fullscreenBenjamin Netanyahu speaking during the opening of the winter session of the Knesset on Monday.Photograph: Ronen Zvulun/ReutersIssuing what many saw as another thinly veiled threat to Israel’s government, Trump also told Time magazine he was weighing whether to support the release of the imprisoned Fatah leader Marwan Barghouti, the most popular and potentially unifying Palestinian leader, as the US aims to fill a leadership vacuum in postwar Gaza.“I am literally being confronted with that question about 15 minutes before you called,” he said. “That was my question of the day. So I’ll be making a decision.”A spokesperson for the head of the Palestinian Authority, President Mahmoud Abbas, welcomed Trump’s warning to Israel that it could lose all US support if it tried to annex the West Bank.Nabil Abu Rudeineh also urged the US president “to continue making more significant efforts that can achieve security and stability in the Middle East”, according to a statement shared by the Wafa news agency.While the eyes of the world are on Gaza, Israeli settlers in the West Bank still behave with impunity | Ofer CassifRead moreIsrael has occupied the West Bank since 1967 when it was captured from Jordan in the six-day war. Since then, successive governments have tried to permanently cement Israelicontrol over the land, in part by declaring swathes of the territory as “state lands”, which prevents private Palestinian ownership.Since Hamas’s attack on 7 October 2023, which triggered Israel’s offensive in Gaza, the country’s far-right government – the most extreme in its history – has accelerated efforts to annex the West Bank, approving dozens of new settlements across the occupied Palestinian territories in an unprecedented expansion.In August, Israel approved a long-delayed settlement project that would in effect sever the occupied West Bank from East Jerusalem, bisecting the territory and further undermining hopes for a viable Palestinian state.Construction in the so-called E1 area has been stalled for more than two decades amid international opposition, but a defence ministry committee gave the go-ahead for 3,400 homes.The far-right finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, who lives in the West Bank settlement of Kedumim, which is considered illegal under international law, announced the plans in the summer, saying the very idea of a Palestinian statewas “being erased”.Alongside political moves toward annexing Palestinian territory, settler violence against Palestinians has sharply intensified since the war in Gaza began.According to the UN, more than 1,000 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli forces or settlers in the occupied West Bank since 7 October 2023, while thousands more have been forcibly displaced by settler attacks, movement restrictions and home demolitions.The UN reports that in the first half of 2025 there were 757 settler attacks resulting in casualties or property damage, a 13% rise compared with the same period last year.On Monday, a 55-year-old Palestinian woman was taken to hospital after being beaten over the head by a masked Israeli settler while she was picking olives. Video footage of the attack shows the man striking her unconscious with a stick before hitting her again as she lay motionless on the ground.Explore more on these topicsWest BankIsraelBenjamin NetanyahuJD VanceMarco RubioPalestineMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

The human rights group intends to argue in court that named Britons joined a foreign army at war with a state,Palestine, which the UK was not fighting.It claims that waging war with a foreign force is a breach of section 4 of the Foreign Enlistment Act 1870. The act makes it an offence for any person to accept or agree a commission or engagement in the military service of any foreign state at war with another foreign state that is at peace with the UK government.The ICJP has named one individual in the attempted prosecution but has gathered evidence against more than 10 British citizens.To enhance the prospects of a successful prosecution and prevent the case being prejudiced, the ICJP is not naming the individuals they want to be arrested.The ICJP accuses the Israel Defense Forces of conducting a war that is not confined to Hamas but is against all Palestinians and Palestine itself, a state now recognised by the UK.The group says it needs to prove the defendant is a British subject, accepted a commission or engagement in the Israeli armed forces, that Israel was at war with Palestine, that Palestine is a foreign state and finally that Palestine was at peace with the UK.Israeli domestic law does not require any person outside its territory, including Israeli citizens who are British subjects, to accept or agree to accept any commission or engagement in the military. This means that British nationals who fought for the IDF did so voluntarily.The ICJP says multiple and repeated military activities directed at civilians and civilian infrastructure in the West Bank andGazashow Israel has been at war with all Palestine.It claims Israel is illegally occupying the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and the Gaza Strip, as determined by the international court of justice in advisory opinions issued in July last year and again this week.Explore more on these topicsPalestineIsraelGazaIsrael-Gaza warMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

In the end, the ruling was both simple and obvious:Israelis the occupying power in Gaza, the West Bank (including East Jerusalem), and is therefore obligated to ensure the basic needs of the population are met.That was the verdict in the latestinternational court of justice case between Israel and Palestine, which also examined Israel’s decision to bar the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) from operating in the occupied territories. The world’s top court found that Israel had failed to provide evidence for its claims that UNRWA lacked neutrality, or that a significant number of its employees were members of Hamas or other armed groups.It therefore called on Israel to cooperate with UN humanitarian agencies to ensure the delivery of aid in the occupied territories, particularly inGaza, and warned against the use of starvation as a weapon of war.The ruling comes amid a tentative ceasefire in Gaza between Israel and Hamas, which has allowed for the release of hostages and prisoners, as well as the exchange of dead bodies from both sides.At the heart of the ceasefire is the ramping up of much needed aid into the devastated strip. But this week, the UN World Food Programme reported that while aid deliveries to Gaza have increased since the ceasefire, they remain wellbelow the daily target of 2,000 tonnes, with only two border crossings currently open.I spoke toEyad Amawi, a representative of the Gaza Relief Committee, who is living in the Gaza Strip, about what life is like in the territory, and what people there say they most desperately need. That’s after the headlines.Five big storiesEnergy| Ministers are consideringdropping one of their central green pledgesin an effort to keep energy bills down, sources have told the Guardian.UK news| Keir Starmer’s grooming gangs inquiry hasdescended into fresh turmoilafter the only remaining candidate to be its chair blamed “political opportunism” and “a lack of trust” for his withdrawal as an applicant.Schools| One in 12 secondary pupils report being put intoschool isolation rooms at least once a weekwhere they often spend in excess of eight hours, missing more than a full day of lessons, according to research.Immigration and asylum |A man sent back to France under the “one in, one out” scheme has returned to the UK on a small boat,the Guardian has learned. The man is being held in a UK immigration detention centre and claims to be a victim of modern slavery.Ukraine war| TheUS has sanctioned Rosneft and Lukoil, Russia’s two largest oil companies, as the Trump administration increased pressure on the Kremlin to negotiate an end to itswar against Ukraine.In depth: ‘My son doesn’t recognise the names of ordinary fruits and vegetables’View image in fullscreenA child waits to collect food in Gaza City this week.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesOn 22 August, UN-backed experts declaredan “entirely man-made” faminewas taking place in Gaza’s largest city and its surrounding area. The Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) warned of an exponential increase in deaths across the devastated territory if aid didn’t ramp up.Eyad Amawi told me that while there is a general stability in the availability of staple foods such as flour and canned goods since the ceasefire came in, the flow of more nutritional items remains severely lacking, particularly when it comes to vegetables, fruits, and all kinds of meat, whether frozen or fresh.Just then, his four-year-old son comes into the room and wants to say hello. “He spent the past two years living with this genocide,” says Amawi. “When I asked him about the names of fruits and vegetables, he didn’t recognise a lot of them. He just knows bananas, because we provide them with a banana from time to time, and some apples.”He explained that one apple currently costs us up to $4 (about £3). But before the war began, it was around two to three dollars per kilogram. Across the Strip, children and adults are in desperate need of simple nourishing food. Among them are thousands of children whose bodies bear the quiet evidence of hunger: yellowing skin and protruding bones.“Stopping the genocide is not just about ending the bombardment,” Amawi said. “We are still facing difficulties in just trying to keep ourselves alive.”A power vacuumIsrael launched its war in Gaza with the stated aim of destroying Hamas, after the Palestinian militant group carried out an unprecedented incursion that killed about 1,200 Israelis, most of them civilians, and led to the kidnapping of 250 hostages, including women and children.But critics have long said that Israel’s failure to plan for “the day after” has deepened the humanitarian devastation in the strip. Israeli leaders have ruled out allowing the Palestinian Authority, which governs parts of the West Bank, to administer Gaza. At the same time, Israel has been accused ofblurring the distinction between Hamas fighters and those working in Gaza’s civil administration. The Palestinian death toll is now above 68,000, the majority of them women and children, while a UN commission has found thatIsrael is committing genocide in Gaza.There is now a power vacuum in Gaza, Amawi explains, one that has allowed chaos to persist. “There is no central authority in Gaza that regulates prices – neither the ministry of economy nor any other governmental body – because Israel prevents any formal governmental activities in Gaza under the claim that they are all working for Hamas.”He told me that price manipulation and market speculation have come to dominate Gaza’s economy. The resale of humanitarian aid by ordinary people, traders and others has further fuelled instability and soaring prices. The constant air of doubt that lingers over the delicate ceasefire is reflected in the prices and availability of food across Gaza’s market stalls.“There was a sharp rise in prices yesterday,” he said. “For instance, the price of one kilogram of frozen chicken in the market exceeded 80 chickens. And this rise has affected all other nutritious goods.”He estimated that currently around 200 to 250 trucks are entering Gaza, which Amawi described as a drop in the ocean and far below the 600 daily trucks promised in the ceasefire. “Only 986 trucks have entered the Gaza Strip since the ceasefire took effect,” Amawi said. “That number should be 6,600 trucks.”Amawi also criticised Israel’s strict control over import permits for Gaza’s private traders, which were halted for much of the war. Trade has now partly resumed through a small number of approved merchants, but tight checks and limits remain. As a result, he said, fruits and vegetables have become scarce and far more expensive.An open graveyardView image in fullscreenThe number of aid trucks entering Gaza is far below the amount promised in the ceasefire, says Eyad Amawi.Illustration: Guardian DesignThe ceasefire came under serious threat last week after Israel launched waves of lethal airstrikes on Sunday and cut off all aid into Gaza “until further notice” after a reported attack by Hamas-linked militants killed Israeli soldiers. Nearly 100 Palestinians have been killed, and 230 wounded, since the truce came into effect on 10 October,according to Al Jazeera.Amawi says that he believes 70 bombs were dropped in his area alone that night, when he gathered his family into a room. Describing it as collective punishment of the besieged population, he said: “They hit homes, schools, tents, streets. We halted our life activity at that moment and waited over radio or WhatsApp groups to hear news.”He sighed with relief when word finally came that the ceasefire would hold, but the calm was short-lived. While much of the western media has focused on the struggle to recover the bodies of Israeli hostages, Amawi urged the international community to also turn its attention to the vast open graveyard that Gaza has become.Gaza’s civil defence agency estimates that thebodies of about 10,000 peopleare trapped under the debris and collapsed buildings.“We need to recover them and bury them. It’s a matter of dignity and respect for the people; for their children, fathers, relatives. No one mentions them. No one has increased pressure to bring in equipment to dig and remove rubble, and to search for our people’s bodies and remains,” he said.Amawi explained that local municipalities need heavy machinery, such as bulldozers, cranes, and other equipment, to clear debris, reopen roads, and begin restoring essential places such as schools. “I have four children and have registered three of them in the school. But until this moment, all of the displaced people are still in the school, or what remains of it, and can’t evacuate because there’s no other place appropriate for them to go.”Palestinians in Gaza need 300,000 tents, he added, but even that has been a struggle to get into the strip.The struggle to recoveryNear the end of our conversation, Amawi took his phone to show me the view from outside his window. It is one of devastation, with tents surrounding the few buildings remaining. He described an ordinary day in his neighbourhood: “People wait for the truck of water to supply them with the water for daily use, and after one hour they will wait in a crowded line for the community kitchen to distribute foods also.”It is not a life, he told me, and can barely be described as an existence. “The famine is being re-engineered and re-managed. There is no tangible change since the ceasefire, especially in sweet water [what Palestinians call drinkable water].”Amawi believes that UNRWA is best place to scale up operations in the strip, echoing the ICJ’s ruling yesterday. Israel, however, rejected the court’s opinion as “political” and said it would not cooperate with the agency.Amawi, whose expertise is in health issues, said many of those in Gaza have constant pain in their stomachs because they are drinking polluted waters.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

And even if there is a surge in drinkable water and nutritious food, recovery will be arduous for all. “My children are exhausted, they have been losing weight for a long time. Recovery won’t be easy,” Amawi said. “Right now, when I have an extra amount of bread, I feel pain in my stomach because we have gotten into the habit of eating one meal a day. So when we get an extra amount of our portion of food, we feel physical pain, but we also feel pain in our soul.”He told me he tries not to show his fear about the future to his children, wife, family and the rest of his community. “We send out statements that the war has ended and we will rebuild Gaza; we will be feeding our children normally; we will rebuild our homes; we will set up new camps to save our people’s dignity,” he said before adding that the painful truth is, “everything is completely destroyed here in Gaza”.What else we’ve been readingView image in fullscreenRose Stokes investigates why new mums are using weight loss jabs despite the risks.Illustration: Kika Klat/The GuardianDespite NHS advice to the contrary, some mothers are using GLP-1 agonists likeOzempicbecause of the pressure to “snap back” after birth.

Between 2010 and 2020, the population of the whales – previously hunted to the brink of extinction during the commercial whaling era, and vulnerable to collisions with ships and entanglements in fishing gear – fell about 25%.But in the last four years, something has shifted, and the number is headed in a more encouraging direction. This year, the scientists who study them say,another small growth in population has continued the trend: there are now an estimated 384 whales, up by 8 on 2024.Scientists have cautioned in recent years that the whale’s slow recovery is happening at a time when the giant animals still face threats, and that stronger conservation measures are needed. But there are also reasons to believe the whales are turning a corner in terms of low reproduction numbers.This year, four mother whales had calves for the first time, while others had shorter intervals between calves. New management measures in Canada that seek to keep the whales safe are credited with playing a major role.“We know that a modest increase every year, if we can sustain it, will lead to population growth,” said Philip Hamilton, a senior scientist with the New England Aquarium’s Anderson Cabot Center for Ocean Life. “It’s just whether or not we can sustain it.”Sign up herefor a weekly roundup of The Upside, sent to you every SundayBored at work?And finally, the Guardian’s puzzles are here to keep you entertained throughout the day.

While the frauds can involve assets such as gold, wine, property, carbon credits and land, it is thought that fake cryptocurrency tops the list.The banking body UK Finance, which issued the data, said industry intelligence pointed to “an ongoing prevalence of scams related to cryptocurrencies and the promise of significant returns advertised on social media”.For the victims, it often starts by clicking on a (fake) social media advert or news alert or watching a deepfake video. This typically is a tip for a supposedly lucrative crypto investment, but is in fact a trick that leads to fraudsters impersonating a real business.Investors often hand over a relatively small sum at first – perhaps £250 – and, thanks to sophisticated tools used by the scammers, such as software that displays a seemingly live crypto trading screen, they think they are getting rich.Victims typically lose bigger sums trying to cash out, with their “winnings” always blocked by the need for another payment, which might be a broker’s fee or a tax bill.In March the Guardianreported on a crypto scamoperating from the former Soviet state of Georgia that tricked people in the UK out of £9m. Deepfake videos and fictional news reports featuring the likes of the money expert Martin Lewis were used to promote the fake investments.Some individuals, including people who work in finance, have beenconned out of hundreds of thousands of pounds.The UK Finance findings are likely to increase calls for cryptocurrency firms and trade bodies to play a bigger part in industry efforts to fight fraud through collaboration.On Wednesday, Stop Scams UK helda behind-closed-doors roundtablefor firms in the banking, telecoms and technology sectors, which was attended by the Bank of England governor, Andrew Bailey, and the fraud minister, Lord Hanson.It is understood that some attendees were keen for the cryptocurrency sector to participate in a continuing collaboration, with firms working together to share data and propose solutions.UK Finance is calling on the government’s forthcoming fraud strategy “to ensure all sectors are accountable in preventing fraud”.Another area where there was a “concerning” increase in fraud losses wasromance scams, where victims were tricked into believing they were in a relationship, with the total amount stolen up 35% on last year.There was a 27% increase in contactless card fraud in the first six months of 2025.Many experts believe that the true totals are much higher, as many scam victims do not report the crime, often because they feel embarrassed or ashamed.Responding to the data, the Payments Association, a trade body, said UKpolicymakers had “failed to address the main issue: blocking fraud at source, preventing crime from happening and mandating responsibility for social media”.Richard Daniels, director of fraud at the bank TSB, said these crimes were being driven and enabled by “vulnerabilities in other sectors – especially social media”. He added: “Phone companies and social media platforms must urgently act to cut scam content off at source.”Explore more on these topicsScamsCybercrimeConsumer affairsInvestmentsCryptocurrenciesCrimeAlternative investmentsnewsShareReuse this content"

The treatment is delivered alongside androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), a hormone therapy that lowers testosterone levels.Data show the treatment combination is better than using ADT alone and is as effective as other combination treatments, according to Nice.Helen Knight, the director of medicines evaluation at Nice, said: “I’m pleased we can recommend this new combination treatment, which provides another much-needed option for people with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer.“We are determined to ensure that effective treatments such as darolutamide, which can help extend the length and quality of people’s lives, are made available fast to the people who need them.”For those with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer – where the disease has spread to other parts of the body – treatment options typically involve ADT, either on its own or combined with other drugs.Trials show adding darolutamide to standard ADTcuts the risk of death by 46%compared with ADT alone, with evidence suggesting it is as effective as other combination treatments already recommended by Nice and available on the NHS.The charity ProstateCancerUK said the new drug offered men a “gentler” treatment option with fewer side-effects compared with ADT in combination with other therapies. This could benefit older men or those who cannot be prescribed current treatments.Amy Rylance, an assistant director of health improvement at Prostate Cancer UK, said: “Darolutamide is an important new treatment that gives thousands of men with incurable prostate cancer another effective option that could halve their risk of death.“While it’s just as effective as existing drugs, it has fewer side-effects. Our hope is that this will make it easier for more men to benefit from these treatments – because right now, too many men are missing out on the treatments that can extend their lives.“It’s great that new drugs like this are being approved but this is only the first step – that’s why the government must ensure the new national cancer plan includes steps to make sure the right treatments reach the men who need them.”Rylance said she had concerns that some men now eligible for the drug may still be unable to access it because of a “postcode lottery of care” in England.She highlighted data from the recent national prostate cancer audit, which showed that less than half (47%) of men with advanced prostate cancer got the latest recommended treatments.Peter Johnson, the clinical director for cancer at NHS England, said: “This decision provides another welcome treatment option for patients living with an advanced and aggressive form of prostate cancer.“With several proven therapies already available on the NHS, this approval gives clinicians and their patients more flexibility to choose the approach best suited to individual circumstances and clinical needs.”Explore more on these topicsProstate cancerCancerNHSNational Institute for Health and Care ExcellenceHealthEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

And for people who simply don’t want it, well, they don’t need it, apart from the right to work, because we do need to stop people working illegally in our country to do that.”He said “it won’t be the case” that digital ID could end up being used for surveillance.“The idea of having ID on your phone is not that far removed from having bank accounts on your phone or any other apps that people have on their phones,” he said.In a video posted to X, Starmer said the Barclays customers he had spoken to were “really up for it” and “I think once you understand just how much easier it’ll make life, so many more people will be too.”More than 2.9 million people have signed a petition against the measures and net support for digital ID cards fell from 35% in the early summer to -14% after Starmer’s announcement in September, according to polling by More in Common.The government believes digital IDs could be given to every British citizen and legal resident, so even those without passports or driving licences can open a bank account, get a job or apply for a mortgage, letting people prove who they are digitally instead of sending physical documents or paying for private verification services.Peter Hyman, a former adviser to Starmer and Tony Blair, told an event during the Labour party conference in Liverpool that the plans would be “dead in the water” within six months because ministers had failed to make a convincing case for them.Hyman said the scheme’s opponents were “motoring” ahead and that Downing Street should enlist social media influencers to “nail down all the objections” and respond to proliferating conspiracy theories to rescue the policy.The Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesperson, Max Wilkinson, said: “Keir Starmer is trying to put lipstick on a very expensive pig. Relaunching this scheme for the second time this month won’t change the fact it is intrusive, expensive and unnecessary.”Explore more on these topicsKeir StarmerUK civil libertiesnewsShareReuse this content"

By early Thursday morning, hundreds of protesters had gathered outside the Coast Guard base, holding signs with slogans such as “No ICE or Troops in the Bay!”.But just hours later, the president said he would not move forward with a “surge” of federal forces in the area after speaking with the mayor, Daniel Lurie, and Silicon Valley leaders including Marc Benioff, the Salesforce CEO who recentlyapologizedfor saying Trump should send national guard troops, and Jensen Huang, the chief executive of Nvidia.Lurie said he spoke with the president on Wednesday night, and that Trump told him he would call off the deployment.“In that conversation, the president told me clearly that he was calling off any plans for a federal deployment inSan Francisco. Kristi Noem, the homeland security secretary, reaffirmed that direction in our conversation this morning,” Lurie said in a statement.Trump confirmed the conversation on his Truth Social platform, saying: “I spoke to Mayor Lurie last night and he asked, very nicely, that I give him a chance to see if he can turn it around.”In a statement, a spokesperson for Gavin Newsom’s office, Diana Crofts-Pelayo, said of the decision: “Trump has finally, for once, listened to reason – and heard what we have been saying from the beginning.”The sudden reversal came as protesters had mobilized in anticipation of a surge in troops this week. Outside the Coast Guard base in Alameda on an overcast Thursday morning, tensions flared between demonstrators and police, who used flash-bang grenades to clear the crowd as CBP vehicles drove through.View image in fullscreenA protester outside city hall in San Francisco on Thursday.Photograph: Noah Berger/APLater on Thursday morning, protesters were walking in a slow circle at the gates of the Coast Guard base. Many were carrying signs that read: “Protect our neighbors,protegemos nuestros vecinos.” There was at least one person dressed as Batman, and Marvin Gaye was blasting through a loudspeaker.Josh Aguirre, 39, had come to participate in his first ever protest. “It’s scary what’s going on right now, and we’ve got to just stand in solidarity,” said Aguirre, who had come, along with his dog, from East Oakland – a largely Latino and immigrant community.He found out that federal agents would be deployed to the Bay Area from his four-year-old daughter’s school administrators. “And the first thing I thought was the families that I know who bring their kids to school are going to be affected the most,” he said. “It’s important to show up for your community.”Raj, an educator who asked to be identified only by his first name, had come with his 10-year-old daughter. “In the Bay we’re involved … and our kids know what’s happening,” he said. “When federal troops come in here, they won’t just see what they think they’re gonna see, which are like violent agitators. They’re going to see entire communities come out with their kids, with their families, with their teens.”By Thursday afternoon, local leaders and organizers had gathered outside San Francisco’s city hall, where they grappled with the whiplash. It remained unclear whether Trump’s decision to pull back was focused only on San Francisco, or if other Bay Area cities such as Oakland would still be targeted. Further demonstrations were planned throughout the evening.Barbara Lee, the mayor of Oakland, said she had not received any communication from the White House or the homeland security department about federal operations in Oakland. Officials in San Francisco said on Thursday that exact details were still unknown.“At this time, we do not know which federal agencies are being called off. We don’t know if that’s the national guard. We don’t know if it’s ICE, if it’s border patrol,” said Jackie Fielder, the San Francisco city supervisor representing parts of the city’s Mission neighborhood.Fielder also criticized Benioff, Elon Musk and other tech leaders who had voiced support for a national guard deployment in the Bay Area. “I condemn every tech billionaire who supported this,” she said. “This city doesn’t belong to them.”‘Hell on earth’: immigrants held in new California detention facility beg for helpRead moreFielder and other organizers emphasized that even as the region awaits clarity on whether and where there will be a federal deployment, and the extent to which the administration plans to ramp up immigration enforcement in the city, local leaders are going to continue to mobilize rapid response networks, legal aid and other support systems for the residents most affected.“We don’t need to get ready because we’ve been ready,” Fielder said. “This is not a time for panic. It is a time for power across this area.”Trump had signaled for weeks that San Francisco could be the next Democratic city to face an administration crackdown. In an interview on Fox News on Sunday, the president claimed “unquestioned power” to deploy the national guard and argued that San Francisco residents want the military in their city.It was unclear if the national guard would have played a role in operations in the region. But state and local leaders on Wednesday had responded swiftly and strongly to the news of the CBP operations, and vowed to fight any potential deployment of the military.California’s governor, Gavin Newsom, called Trump’s moves “right out of the dictator’s handbook”.“He sends out masked men, he sends out border patrol, he sends out ICE, he creates anxiety and fear in the community so that he can lay claim to solving for that by sending in the [national] guard,” Newsomsaid in a video statement. “This is no different than the arsonist putting out the fire.”Lurie said earlier in the week that his city was prepared.“For months, we have been anticipating the possibility of some kind of federal deployment in our city,” he said.View image in fullscreenProtesters at the entrance to the US Coast Guard base in Alameda.Photograph: Stephen Lam/APRob Bonta, California’s attorney general, vowed to “be in court within hours, if not minutes”, if there is a federal deployment, and the San Francisco city attorney, David Chiu, has promised the same.San Francisco’s district attorney, Brooke Jenkins, said she was ready to prosecute any federal agents who violated California law.San Francisco has been the latest major US city to face Trump’s threats. The administration has previously sent the military to Los Angeles and Chicago, and has tried to deploy troops in Portland. All deployments have faced legal challenges from local and state authorities.Trump in recent weeks argued that a federal operation in San Francisco was necessary to combat crime. “Every American deserves to live in a community where they’re not afraid of being mugged, murdered, robbed, raped, assaulted or shot”he saidat an appearance on 16 October.Local leaders, including the city’s mayor and district attorney, have said crime in the city is under control, pointing to falling crime rates and growing police recruitment. The city’s homicide rate this year is expected to be the lowest since 1954, theSan Francisco Chroniclereported.Community groups had readied themselves to support affected residents. Organizers have mobilized to stage a mass rally in the city, as well as vigils at local libraries.City supervisor Jackie Fielder told reporters last week she and her constituents in the Mission district had been bracing for this moment.“The moment that people stop going to work, when anyone Black or brown can’t freely walk outside without the fear of Trump’s federal agents racially profiling and arresting them, the moment when parents stop sending kids to school, become too afraid to go to the grocery store or doctor,” Fielder said. “What we have been preparing for in the Mission is essentially a shutdown the likes of which we haven’t seen since Covid.”Explore more on these topicsSan FranciscoDonald TrumpICE (US Immigration and Customs Enforcement)US immigrationTrump administrationWest CoastCalifornianewsShareReuse this content"

Thursday’s announcement comes as part of the Trump administration’sreversalof Joe Biden’s decision in 2024 to expand federal protections across the reserve.‘We know this land’: after Typhoon Halong villages in Alaska confront costs of climate changeRead moreIn addition, the department reissued necessary permits to establish the Ambler Road Project, a controversial proposal for a211-mile gravel road,part of which will bebuilt throughsouth-western Alaska’s Izembek national wildlife refuge.Once built, the road would endanger more than 200,000 migratory birds that cross through the refuge annually, among other wildlife,according tothe National Wildlife Refuge Association. The project would also threaten multiple Indigenous tribes that rely on the area for hunting and fishing. At least 39 of Alaska’s interior villages and 37 tribesopposethe road.Meanwhile, proponents of the project include Alaska’s congressional representatives, who havesaidthat the road is necessary to access a $7bn copper deposit, as well as other manufacturing minerals including cobalt and zinc.Hailing the moves on Thursday, the US interior secretary, Doug Burgum, said: “From day one, President Trump directed us to unlock Alaska’s energy and resource potential while honoring commitments to the state and local communities.“By reopening the coastal plain and advancing key infrastructure, we are strengthening energy independence, creating jobs and supporting Alaska’s communities while driving economic growth across the state,” he added.Environmental groups have sounded the alarm, with the Alaska Wilderness Leaguesaying:“The Arctic refuge is the crown jewel of our public lands system. During a government shutdown, when everyday Americans are left without basic services, President Trump has chosen to double down on failed policies that prioritize oil corporations over people.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Expanding oil drilling in the Arctic threatens irreplaceable wildlife and cultural traditions that exist nowhere else in the world … The Gwich’in people, most Americans, and even major banks and insurance companies know the Arctic refuge is no place to drill.”The Sierra Club echoed similar sentiments,saying:“These decisions will collectively wreak havoc on fragile Alaska ecosystems in the most disruptive way possible, causing long-term environmental damage, all to boost the bottom lines of CEOs.”Explore more on these topicsAlaskaTrump administrationWildlifeIndigenous peoplesConservationGas (Environment)Gas (Business)newsShareReuse this content"

The president said in a social media post that “friends of mine who live in the area called last night to ask me not to go forward with the surge”. He specifically mentioned Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff.Trump cancels plans to send federal troops to San Francisco for immigration crackdownRead more“The people of San Francisco have come together on fighting Crime, especially since we began to take charge of that very nasty subject,” Trump wrote onTruth Social, the social media network he owns. “Great people like Jensen Huang, Marc Benioff, and others have called saying that the future of San Francisco is great. They want to give it a ‘shot.’ Therefore, we will not surge San Francisco on Saturday.”The move comes as tech leaders have increasingly enjoyed a cozy relationship with the president: frequently meeting with him at the White House, agreeing topay millions of dollars to settle lawsuitsand being selected forlucrative government contracts. The alliance has even brought millions of dollars to helpfund the constructionof Trump’s $300m ballroom at the White House with Apple, Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, Google and Palantir all chipping in.The sway tech leaders now have over government policy is far more vast than any previous administration, including Trump’s first term. The president appears to listen to their advice, even when it comes to matters wholly outside of the tech realm, such as deploying the national guard to US cities.“President Trump’s back-and-forth over sending troops toSan Franciscoshows just how much power a handful of tech executives have to influence decisions that affect millions of Americans,” said Alix Fraser, the vice-president of advocacy at Issue One, a nonprofit that seeks to reduce the influence of money in politics. “No one elected these CEOs, but their money and access have given them an outsized voice in Washington – and everyday people are left out of the conversation.”Trump has repeatedly floated the idea of deploying federal troops to San Francisco, but the plan seemed to have accelerated last week afterBenioff told the New York Timesthat he supported Trump and backed him sending national guard soldiers to the city. “We don’t have enough cops, so if they can be cops, I’m all for it,” Benioff told the paper.Benioff’s comments drew intense blowback from city leaders. The Salesforce CEO had been seen as more of a progressive tech leader, supporting causes that addressed homelessness and LGBTQ+ initiatives. He’s also donated millions to local hospitals and schools. In the aftermath of Benioff’s comments, tech leader Ron Conway said he was stepping down from the board of Salesforce’s philanthropic branch and dozens of Salesforce employeessigned a petitionurging the CEO to “retract your endorsement” of sending troops to San Francisco. Gavin Newsom, California’s governor,told the New York Timesthat Benioff was a longtime friend and like “family” but that he still bristled at the CEO’s comments.The day after Conway stepped down,Benioff apologizedand walked back his endorsement of the troop deployment. By that point, however, other tech leaders, including Elon Musk and Trump’s AI czar David Sacks, had already jumped in on social media urging the government to send in the troops. Muskcalleddowntown San Francisco a “drug zombie apocalypse” andsaidfederal intervention was the “only solution at this point”.On Monday, Trump announced the surge, saying more than 100 Customs and Border Protection and other federal agents were being sent to the Bay Area for a large-scale immigration enforcement plan.As San Franciscobraced for the federal troopsto sweep through city streets on Thursday, Trump made his surprise announcement that he was calling it off. During a press conference, the president said he had “four or five calls” with people from San Francisco.“We were gonna do a big surge in San Francisco, but I got a great call from some incredible people, some friends of mine, very successful people,” Trump said. “They said ‘we’re working really really hard with the mayor and we’re making progress, would it be possible for you to hold off the surge’… They have great competence, those people. Incredible competence. Some of the smartest business leaders.”Fraser, from Issue One, said when national policy is decided by phone calls between the president and business leaders, it can be problematic for democracy. “When political leaders take cues from wealthy executives and special interests rather than the public, it deepens the sense that government works for the powerful, not for the people,” he said.Nvidia and Salesforce did not return request for comment.Explore more on these topicsSan FranciscoUS militaryUS politicsDonald TrumpTrump administrationCaliforniaWest CoastnewsShareReuse this content"

The action is the latest example of the growing number of federal judgespushing backagainst Trump administration moves.Wednesday’s decision came after secretary of veterans affairs, Doug Collins, asked the court to halt work on nearly all cases until the government shutdown concludes.“Pausing VA’s deadlines in nearly every case before the court is a significant and extreme request, and the secretary has failed to demonstrate that such sweeping relief is appropriate,” the judges wrote.Veterans groups, which have urged politicians to end the shutdown, said Collins was using the impasse as a pretext to deny veterans their day in court.“Some of those veterans have already waited 10, 20 or even 50 years for VA, the law, and the science to allow them to file claims for toxic exposure such as Agent Orange and burn pits,” said Paul Sullivan, a Gulf war veteran and national vice-chair of the advocacy group Veterans for Common Sense. “If VA had prevailed, these veterans could have faced indefinite delays for their benefits and in some cases their care. Trump sought to make those veterans wait longer, and that’s unconscionable.”The VA press secretary, Pete Kasperowicz, did not respond to inquiries by the Guardian’s deadline. In its petition, agency general counsel James Baehr acknowledged that “delaying these veterans’ cases is undesirable”, but said the lapse of federal funding could preclude the VA from “performing the official functions necessary to satisfy the court’s filing deadlines in most of the cases currently pending before the court”.The court of appeals for veterans claims hearsapproximately 15,000 casesa year. In most cases, it either grants the veterans’ claim for compensation or sends the case back to VA claims adjudicators to resolve errors that could have led to a wrongful denial of benefits.As of September 2024, the median time between a veteran filing an appeal to disposition of a case by the court was 222 days, or seven and a half months.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationUS militaryUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

He was sentenced to four months in prison.Melania Trump’s meme coin architects accused of pump-and-dump fraud in lawsuitRead moreZhao, who is often referred to by his initials CZ, is one of the world’s richest people and biggest names in cryptocurrency. He built Binance into the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, although the company has been barred from operating in the US after his 2023 guilty plea.Trump’s pardon is an immense victory for Zhao and Binance after months of speculation and lobbying. It is also yet another sign of the Trump administration’s shift toward easing scrutiny on the crypto industry, at a time when Trump and his family are building their own multibillion-dollar crypto empire.“Incredible news of CZ’s pardon today. We thank President Trump for his leadership and for his commitment to make the US the crypto capital of the world,” a spokesperson for Binance said in a statement.Trump commented on the pardon during an exchange with the press on Thursday afternoon, downplaying Zhao’s crimes while claiming that he did not personally know the crypto mogul.“Are you talking about the crypto person? A lot of people say that he wasn’t guilty of anything,” Trump told a reporter who asked about the decision. “They say what he did was not even a crime. It wasn’t a crime. That he was persecuted by the Biden administration, and so I gave him a pardon at the request of a lot of very good people.”Representatives from Trump’s family crypto business have held talks with Binance about taking a stake in the US arm of the exchange, the Wall Street Journalreportedearlier this year. Zhao disputed that he was seeking to make a deal in exchange for a pardon.“Fact: I have had no discussions of a Binance US deal with … well, anyone,” Zhao claimed in a post on X in March. “No felon would mind a pardon,” he added.Binance has nevertheless played an important part in the growth of the Trump family’s World Liberty Financial crypto enterprise. When Binance accepted a $2bn transaction from an Emirati investment fund earlier this year, it agreed to have the funds be paid in a cryptocurrency developed by World Liberty Financial – a move that legitimized the Trump family’s digital currency and was highly lucrative for the firm.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The French aerospace companyAirbuswill own 35% of the new business, with Leonardo and Thales each owning stakes of 32.5%.The as-yet-unnamed tie-up will be one of the largest of its kind inEurope, combining satellite manufacturing, space systems, components and services from the continent’s leading aerospace and defence manufacturers.Guillaume Faury, the chief executive of Airbus, Roberto Cingolani, the chief executive of Leonardo, and Patrice Caine, the chief executive of Thales, said in a joint statement that the new company marked “a pivotal milestone for Europe’s space industry”.“By pooling our talent, resources, expertise and R&D capabilities, we aim to generate growth, accelerate innovation and deliver greater value to our customers and stakeholders,” they said.The aim is for the company, which will be based in Toulouse,France, and employ about 25,000 people, will be operational in 2027, after it secures regulatory approval. It should generate “mid-triple digit” millions of euros of synergies on operating income per year, starting after five years, the companies said.Talks between Airbus, Leonardo and Thales have been running for the last year, in an effort to mimic the model of the European missile maker MBDA, which is owned by Airbus, Leonardo and BAE Systems.The companies, which have together cut thousands of jobs in their space businesses in recent years, said there would be no immediate site closures or job losses but that unions would be consulted on the project.The businesses have been struggling recently with their space operations. Last year Airbus incurred €1.3bn in charges from underperforming space contracts and announced 2,000 job cuts in its defence and space division. Thales AleniaSpace, a joint venture between Thales and Leonardo, cut more than 1,000 jobs last year.SpaceX, which Musk founded in 2002, has grown to become one of the biggest startups in the world, at a valuation of $400bn (£300bn).As well as providing cheaper rocket launch services,SpaceX’s Starlink constellationof smaller, relatively cheap, low-earth orbit satellites is eating into the European companies’ sales of bulkier geostationary communications satellites.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But we’ll do it in the future.”The oil price is now on track for its biggest rise since July, according to analysts at Deutsche Bank.Jorge León, the head of geopolitical analysis at Rystad Energy, a leading energy consultancy, described the US sanctions against Russia as “a significant and unprecedented escalation in Washington’s pressure campaign against Moscow”.He added: “The sharp rise in oil prices following the announcement underscores market fears that Russian crude exports – particularly to India, one of its key customers – could fall sharply.”The price rise could also raise the prospect of “major disruptions” to Russian crude production and exports that would cause oil market prices to rise higher, he said. “The big question now is whether Washington’s latest sanctions will be enough to draw Moscow back to the negotiating table – and, if they fail to do so, what options remain to increase pressure without crossing the line into open confrontation,” León said.Quick GuideContact Guardian Business about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject you can contact the Business team confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

Howard Lutnick, the commerce secretary and former CEO of Cantor Fitzgerald, is also on the list.Trump’s ballroom blitz sparks chorus of disgust: ‘The perfect symbol’Read moreSome donors last week were invited to a White House dinner celebrating their contribution to the ballroom project, including representatives from Google, Amazon and Lockheed Martin.“Chief executives throughout history have contributed to making the White House special, and nothing of this magnitude has been done,” Trump told the donors at the start of the dinner, according to theWall Street Journal.Speaking to reporters at the White Houseon Wednesday, Trump said the ballroom “is being paid for 100% by me and some friends of mine”. While the president initially said the 90,000 sq ft ballroom would cost $200m, he upped the figure to $300m on Wednesday.Annotated top-down mapPlans of any demolition had not been announced when backhoes startedguttingthe East Wing on Monday. Multiple reports have cited senior officials who said that the demolition would be completed “within days”.In response to a question on the sudden demolition, Trump on Wednesday said the East Wing “was never thought of as being much”.“It was a very small building,” he said, adding that “in order to do it properly, we had to take down the existing structure.”In remarks made over the summer, however, when Trump first announced plans for his new ballroom, he said the project would not affect the existing structure. “It won’t interfere with the current building. It’ll be near it but not touching it,” he said. “And pays total respect to the existing building, which I’m the biggest fan of.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The National Trust for Historic Preservation, a major non-profit that advocates for preservation of historic buildings,toldthe White House that it was “legally required” to undergo the public review process with the commission.John Rogers, executive vice-president and secretary to the board of Goldman Sachs, has served as chairman of the White House Historical Association since 2022, andreportedlygave staffing advice to Melania Trump during the presidential transition.Approached for comment on the destruction of the East Wing, the Goldman press office said Rogers – who in 2022 hosted a WHHA summit whose theme was “the White House belongs to the American people” – was not available to comment.The WHHA did not immediately provide a comment on the destruction but said in a statement that, upon announcement of the ballroom project, it had supported the preservation of East Wing history through a “comprehensive digital scanning project and photography to create an historic record”.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpWashington DCCryptocurrenciesTrump administrationnewsShareReuse this content"

His clampdown on migration is hitting access to labor, from agriculture tohealthcare. The drawn-out government shutdown is starting tosap economic growth.Yet all this has been no match for the AI boom. Amid the mire of dismal statistics, the bacchanal of investment by a narrow clutch of technology firms pursuing the dream of superhuman artificial intelligence is single-handedly sustaining economic growth.

Trying to predict economic inflection points and stock market convulsions is pointless. Still, the precarious balance of the American economy offers some pretty good clues about where we are heading: we’re probably toast, however the AI story plays out.What if the AI-driven stock market surge turns out to be a bubble? Investors are clearlynervous. The VIX Index, the financial markets’ “fear gauge” that measures expectations of future stock swings, last week hit its highest since “liberation day” in April, when Trump unleashed a barrage of tariffs which sent markets into a tailspin.The AI promise does not offer to replicate some human tasks. It proposes to replicate humansSuddenly, the entire AI project is clouded in an immediate, tangible fear: what if investors come to realize that the stupendous productivity gains that Silicon Valley assures us will more than justify plowing hundreds of billions of dollars into ever more powerful AI agents won’t, in fact, materialize? Trillions of dollars in stock wealth could go poof in days.Former IMF chief economist Gita Gopinathestimates thatif the market crashes like it did after the dotcom bubble burst at the turn of the century, it would wipe out $20tn in wealth held by American households and $15tn in wealth held by investors in the rest of the world.But consider the opposite scenario. What if the dream doesn’t collapse? AI progress over the coming months looks like it will justify Silicon Valley’s productivity dreams. Evidence of its benefits starts showing up in corporate profits. Investors become comfortable with the lofty valuations ofNvidia, Alphabet and the rest of the so-called “magnificent seven” – the tech giants whose combined valuation now accounts for about a third of the entire S&P 500 index of the US’s largest companies. What kind of world do we get then? What would the grand productivity leap mean for humanity?Stock chart of the tech giants outperforming the S&P 500In econospeak, productivity growth is beneficial by definition. It is what drives rising living standards. The technological progress that drives productivity growth – by allowing us to make new products and services, faster and more cheaply – doesbring about losers. Think about farm workers, who accounted for 40% of jobs at the turn of the 20th century, or administrative assistants rendered pointless by the PC,or horses, bumped from their perch in the economy by the internal combustion engine.But workers as a whole have generally gained from rising wages as they adapted to use new tech. Rising income created demand for new products, which opened new jobs. The market price of an hour of labor – ie workers’ wages – has grown tenfold since Luddites started smashing textile machines in the 19th century, even as employment has grown continuously.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But the AI promise is much more ambitious. It does not offer to replicate some human tasks. It proposes to replicate humans. Indeed, the AI revolutionaries aim to build agents that can do everything that humans do but better. It is not a technology that bumps workers into new tasks. It is designed to perform all the tasks at a higher level than any human worker could.This would create a problem that the labor market used to solve: how will people make a living? Redistribution might take its place. But as Erik Brynjolfsson of Stanford Universityput it, the new arrangement would vastly concentrate wealth and power. Most of us “would depend precariously on the decisions of those in control of the technology”, he argued. Society would risk “being trapped in an equilibrium where those without power have no way to improve their outcomes”.Maybe we should hope the AI revolution unfolding before us turns into a bubble that pops. We will all suffer when it bursts – pushing the world into a recession. But after the project falls apart, perhaps humanity can build something more promising, less dangerous, from the pieces.Brynjolfsson points out that the value gained from automation pales alongside the gains from creating something new. In this vein, he suggests that AI should be aimed at building agents to augment rather than replace labor, to help human workers perform tasks that they currently can’t do. AI is already helpingdesign new proteins. On a more prosaic level, it could help provide nurses the technical expertise that would allow them to perform tasks reserved for doctors.Investment bubbles leave valuable knowledge and infrastructure in their wake. The current information ecosystem was built from the rubble of the dotcom bust. A century and a half before then, investors lost their shirts in the crash that followed massive investments in British railways. The British economy sank into a painful recession. But the bubble left behind miles and miles of valuable railway track.Perhaps an AI crash could lay the groundwork to steer the technology away from Silicon Valley’s quest to build some supersmart, software-driven agent to replace meat-and-bones humans and spread asynthetic version of humanityacross the galaxy. We could focus instead on building something that will help improve the lives of humans as they are.Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)NvidiaTeslaMicrosoftStock marketsUS economyEconomicsanalysisShareReuse this content"

In August 1889, a worn-down pitcher for the Pittsburgh Alleghenys named James Francis “Pud” Galvin, so nicknamed for his once-devastating ability to reduce hitters to “pudding”, was in need of a spark. He was 32, his right arm a rubbery relicof nearly 5,000 innings pitched, his career on the fade. Then came salvation in a syringe. A French-Mauritian doctor by the name of Charles-Édouard Brown-Séquard published a paper – The Effects Produced on Man by the Subcutaneous Injections of a Liquid Obtained from the Testicles of Animals –in which he claimedthat a few drops of an extract sourced from dogs and guinea pigs might well make ordinary men stronger and more virile. Galvin, a stocky power pitcher, wasted no time getting jabbed with the so-called Brown-Séquard elixir in a public demonstration at the Western Pennsylvania Medical College, only four miles east from the team’s home ground. The next day he pitched a five-hit shutout to turn back the Boston Beaneaters, adding a double and a triple at the plate off the great Old Hoss Radbourn for good measure. (Take that,Ohtani.)View image in fullscreenPud Galvin threw a five-hit shutout on 13 April 1889.Photograph: Washington Post“If there still be doubting Thomases who concede no virtue of the elixir, they are respectfully referred to Galvin’s record in yesterday’s Boston-Pittsburg game,” wrote the Washington Post, with proto-advertorial flourish. “It is the best proof yet furnished of the value of the discovery.” No one thought to call it cheating, even before Brown-Séquard’s colleaguescalled cap on the tonic’s efficacyin the weeks that followed. Why would they? Good old Pud wasn’t breaking the rules so much as pushing the boundaries of willpower and endurance. In baseball, those things have often been one and the same.A century and a half later, another kind of chemical promise ended differently. In a California courtroom this month, lawyers for the family of Tyler Skaggs, the Los Angeles Angels pitcher whooverdosed on a fentanyl-laced pillin 2019, argued that the team itselfshould be held responsiblefor his death. The ongoing civil trial follows the criminal conviction of Eric Kay, the Angels’ former communications director, who isserving 22 yearsfor providing the counterfeit oxycodone that killed Skaggs. The pitcher was 27, newly married, and still recovering from a string of injuries that had stalled his career. The pills were supposed to keep him pitching.His family’s attorney, Shawn Holley, who cut her teeth as a deep reserveon OJ’s Dream Team, told jurors that the Angels ignored their own drug policy, allowing a known addict like Kay to keep his job and his access to players. “They buried their heads in the sand over and over and over again,” shesaidTuesday. The team’s lawyer, Todd Theodora, replied that Skaggs’s death was “the result of his own reckless decision to mix large amounts of alcohol with narcotics”. Mike Trout, one of the greatest players of his generation, testified that he loved Skaggs “like a brother” and never saw him use, but theAngels’ longtime superstarconfessed he’d seen Kay acting “wired and sweating” and thought immediately of drugs.The case may hinge on legal technicalities, but its meaning extends back decades through the game’s entire pharmaceutical lineage. For practically as long as professional baseball has existed, its players have reached for something – legal, illicit, prescribed, improvised – to dull the ache, sharpen the focus or prolong the dream. The substances may change, but the justifications never have. That it’s all quietly unfolding while the vastly more popular crosstown teambasks in World Series fanfareonly underlines baseball’s helplessness to resist metaphor.MLB star Mike Trout testifies in lawsuit over overdose death of teammate Tyler SkaggsRead moreAfter the second world war, amphetamines – AKA “greenies” – became as much a part of the clubhouse as black coffee and chewing tobacco. Pitcher Jim Bouton wrote in baseball’s all-time bestseller, Ball Four, how bowls of little white pills sat beside the doughnuts before day games. Hall of Famers likeWillie Mayswere said to keep liquid versions in their lockers. The pills didn’t make you stronger, but they made you believe you could keep going. In a sport built on the stubborn art of persistence and routine, that was the whole point.No other professional sport puts a player through quite the same gauntlet. From the interminable grind of a 162-game regular season (which can swell past 200 with spring training and a deep postseason run) to the daily wear and tear of travel, rainouts and doubleheaders, baseball rewards not flashes of brilliance but the simple act of staying in the lineup. The greatest ability is availability. In Bull Durham, Crash Davis’s monologue on the minuscule margins at play over the course of a six-month season – howone hit a weekis the difference between a Hall of Fame career and a forgotten one – lays bare the timeless temptation facing any ballplayer.By 1970, the pursuit of transcendence had turned stranger and somehow more American. On a misty June night in San Diego, Pittsburgh Pirates right-hander Dock Ellisthrew a no-hitter while tripping on LSD. He laterrecalled thinkingRichard Nixon was the home-plate umpire and Jimi Hendrix was batting, Fender Stratocaster at the ready. He walked eight, hit another, allowed three stolen bases, and somehowgave up no hits. It remains one of only 326 no-hitters out of more than 238,000 major-league games played. By the time he went public with the fantastic tale in a 1984 interview with Bob Smizik of the Pittsburgh Press, baseball was happy to let the episode fade into apocryphia.Ellis claimed he pitched every game under the influence of something – booze, Benzedrine, Dexamyl – theold-school Hollywood buffetof the 1970s locker room. After retiring, he got sober, worked in prisons and community programs, and came to regret the accidental feat that defined him. “It robbed me of my greatest professional memory,” he said. Yet his acid-fueled no-no endures as the perfect parable for baseball’s relationship with drugs: a dazzling act of control achieved in a state of delirium, equal parts genius and madness.Cocaine overtook acid and amphetamines as the drug of choice in the 1980s. ThePittsburgh drug trialsin 1985 exposed a league where dealers walked freely into clubhouses and players could procure booger sugar from city to city on the National League circuit as easily as sunflower seeds. MLB commissioner Peter Ueberroth handed down commuted suspensions and promised a reckoning that never truly came (given the players’ union’s intractable stance against mandatory drug testing). The revelations from the FBI’s 14-month investigation were eye-opening. Keith Hernandez, the 1979 NL MVP, admitted he’d used so much cocaine in 1980 that he couldn’t remember the season at all. Hall of Famer Tim Raines testified he kept a vial in his uniform pocket during games and slid head-first to avoid breaking it. A year after the dust settled, Ueberroth told reporters with straight-faced optimism, “Baseball’s drug problem is over. I believe baseball is going to be the first sport to be free of drugs.” Narrator: it was not. In 1992, one of the implicated players, Rod Scurry, died of a cocaine-induced heart attack aged 36.View image in fullscreenDock Ellis wore hair curlers under his cap during pregame warmups in the early 1970s as an act of swagger and defiance, symbolizing his embrace of Black style and individuality within baseball’s rigid, conservative culture.Photograph: Bettmann/Bettmann ArchiveOver the following decade, chemistry turned industrial. Steroids and human growth hormone transformed bodies and baseball’s record books. When Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosachased down and obliteratedRoger Maris’s home-run record in 1998, the sport breathlessly marketed their swollen arms as triumphs of human potential. The league had banned steroids on paper in 1991 but waited a dozen more years to begin serious testing, only when Congress and whistleblower Jose Canseco forced the issue in the early aughts. By the time theMitchell Reportnamed and shamed 90 players in 2007, shedding light on designer performance-enhancing drugs while introducing “the cream” and “the clear” into the cultural lexicon, everyone could only pretend to be shocked by the worst-kept secret in American sports.It was not until 2005, after the steroid scandal broke, that MLB and the players’ unionofficially banned amphetamines. But when steroids faded, another pill quietly took their place: Adderall, the quasi-legal heir to the greenie. The stimulant is illegal without a prescription, yet therapeutic-use exemptions multiplied so quickly that by 2013nearly one in 10 major-leaguers carried one– more than twice the rate in the general adult population. Players described feeling “mentally invincible”, their focus laser-sharp, the ball “looked bigger”.For those without a diagnosis, temptation was everywhere. Pills were traded, borrowed, quietly shared. Officially,MLBwas cracking down on amphetamines; unofficially, it had reinvented them with paperwork. Some players, like minor-league catcher Matt Paré, genuinely needed the medication but chafed at league rules requiring daily use. (Once approved, you’d get dinged if youdidn’ttest for it.) Others simply learned to time their doses between screenings. The drug that once came in green pressies now arrived in orange tablets, the same old chemical fortitude in a new prescription bottle.But the real story remains continuity rather than crisis. From Galvin’s monkey-gland injections to Barry Bonds’s designer creams, from greenies to cocaine to Adderall to fentanyl, the game’s pharmacology was never an aberration but baked in to its tradition. The chemistry evolved, but the impulse never did: play through pain, stretch the body beyond its warning signs, stay in the lineup. The same culture that romanticized toughness – the mid-90s fetishization ofCal Ripken’s ironman streakin the only industrialized country with no federally guaranteed paid leave really does feel like a psyop looking back – was the same one that told players to ice it, pop a pill and get back out there.Skaggs wasn’t trying to break records. He was a rank-and-file hurler out to manage pain. After surgeries and rehab stints, he had become the kind of pitcher modern baseball quietly discards: a once-promising arm now held together by duct tape and meds. The pills were his greenies that let him keep showing up. That they were laced with fentanyl only completed the grim symmetry of baseball’s longest arc: the drugs that once kept players alive on the field could now kill them off it.View image in fullscreenKeith Hernandez, the 1979 NL MVP, was among the baseball stars whose names were tarnished by the Pittsburgh drug trials of 1985.Photograph: Bettmann/Bettmann ArchiveAfter Skaggs’s death, MLB added opioid testing and treatment referrals, just as it had added steroid testing after Balco, just as it had promised clean clubhouses after the cocaine scandals. Every reform has a way of arriving one tragedy late. The cycle repeats because the underlying bargain never changes.Baseballcelebrates the #grindset and looks away from the cost.What makes baseball uniquely vulnerable is its mythology of purity, the idea that it reflects some truer, simpler America. Yet its history reflects the country’s own chemical biography: invention, exploitation, denial, relapse. The substances that helped players endure also helped the league sell endurance as a moral. Other sports metabolized their drug eras – the NBA’s 1970s haze burned off under David Stern’s Olympic-level testing, while in the NFL, pharmaceuticals became accepted tools for managing the excruciating pain the sport inflicts. But baseball’s pharmacology still carries the sting of moral crisis, because it’s the national pastime, because fans still pretend the game’s integrity is sacred and because so much of what’s taken is designed not to dominate but simply to survive.Skaggs’s trial will end the way these things always do: with lawyers parsing intent, responsibility, foreseeability. But the truth exists somewhere closer to Galvin’s mound at Pittsburgh’s long-gone Recreation Park in 1889, where science met desperation and the crowd applauded the result. Baseball’s relationship with drugs has never been about corruption. It has been about belief – the conviction that the body is improvable, that effort and chemistry are just different routes to the same destination, that pain is something to be managed and bargained with, not respected.View image in fullscreenMark McGwire is sworn in at a 2005 hearing by the House Government Affairs Committee looking into the use of steroids among MLB players.Photograph: MCT/Tribune News Service/Getty ImagesGalvin’s Hall of Fame plaquestill hangs in Cooperstown, where he’s immortalized despite a career spanning three decades playing for losing teams in smaller markets like Pittsburgh and Buffalo. It lists his career totals for wins and complete games – both second only to Cy Young – not his hypodermic injections. The elixir is long forgotten, but the inexorable logic behind it endures. The modern player doesn’t need a potion of guinea pig gonads when he has a prescription or a clubhouse attendant who knows where and how to get refills.When the Skaggs trial ends in Santa Ana, the lawyers will pack up their exhibits and the headlines will fade. But somewhere in baseball’s bloodstream, the old faith hums on: the hope that a little something extra can stave off decline, that there’s always another season in the arm if you can just find the right cocktail. From the elixirs of the 1880s to the prescriptions of the 2020s, baseball has woven its chemistry into scripture, a religion of repetition played on tired arms and bad backs, powered by whatever it takes to show up again tomorrow.Explore more on these topicsMLBLos Angeles AngelsFentanylDrugs in sportBaseballDrugsUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

After his comprehensive victoryat the last round in Austin, Verstappen acknowledged that he waswell and truly back in the contest.Red Bull fined £43,000 after team member tries to tamper with Lando Norris grid tapeRead morePiastri, who has not finished in front of Verstappen for the past four rounds and managed no higher than third in that run, said the Dutchman’s resurgence had not been expected. “The run of form that he has had since Monza has been a bit of a surprise. There were flashes of that performance early in the season but also pretty big dips,” Piastri said. “He has come to the fight quicker than I expected.”However, Piastri insisted he remained confident despite the world champion’s run of form. “The gap has shrunk a bit in the last few races but the focus has always been on going as fast as I can,” he said. “I’d rather have the lead than be in any other spot. There is no benefit for me in worrying about that or focusing on that.”Verstappen added that he too had not expected to be fighting for the title, which he had believed was beyond him at the midway point of the season.“I’ve won championships very late, very early,” he said. “Now, this one, of course, is very different because I think for most of the season, it was a lot harder for us. To be honest with you, to still be in this fight is very surprising.“Now we need to be perfect but for me, it’s just positive pressure. I’m loving what I’m doing. If the car is competitive, much better to be racing in it than when it’s not. So every race that you do until the end, we can’t afford any bad luck or mistakes.”View image in fullscreenMax Verstappen’s dominant performance in Austin has added extra spice to this weekend’s Mexican Grand Prix.Photograph: Alessio De Marco/Zuma Press Wire/ShutterstockPiastri also cleared up McLaren’s position after he and Norris had clashed with each other in the last two rounds. After Norris barged into Piastri while overtaking in Singapore, McLaren said there would be “repercussions” for the Briton.In Austin last week, however, Piastri was at fault in a first corner incident with Norris in the sprint race. With Norris starting in second and Piastri in third, the Australian tried to cut back inside his teammate but in doing so was struck by the Sauber of Nico Hülkenberg. His move was risky given how crowded it can be at turn one at the Circuit of the Americas. The impact speared him into Norris at speed, lifted Piastri’s car into the air and entirely sheared off one of Norris’s wheels, damage that ended both their races.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

So, just going out and racing, and see who can come out on top.”He went on to confirm that any potential sanctions against Norris from his move at the Singapore Grand Prix would not be imposed. “The consequences on Lando’s side have been removed,” he said before confirming it was the aggressive nature of his cut-back in Austin that had been considered at fault. “Yes, ultimately it was that. There were a lot of factors involved but yes, ultimately, that’s what has been decided.”Meanwhile, it has emerged that the FIA has reinstated a former Russian general, under sanctions from the US, UK and Canada, to the governing body’s World Motorsport Council.

Members of the world motorsport council are elected, and serve, in an individual capacity. The FIA has a longstanding commitment to upholding motor sport’s neutrality.“Its decision to allow all elected members, regardless of nationality, to continue serving their terms is in line with the approach of other international sports bodies.”Explore more on these topicsFormula OneOscar PiastriMax VerstappenMcLarenRed BullMotor sportnewsShareReuse this content"

Will their season survive?A few months ago Baltimore were seen as a Super Bowl contender; now they’re struggling to make the playoffs. We assess their chances of turning things aroundOliver ConnollyThu 23 Oct 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 23 Oct 2025 08.08 EDTShareThe Ravens’ season is on the brink. Coming out of a bye week, Baltimore are 1-5 after a miserable start partly because their roster has been ripped apart by injuries. Next up are the Chicago Bears, who have come into some form. Beat the Bears, and the Ravenscouldturn the year around.If they lose, and they fall to 1–6, their season is effectively over, a huge disappointment for a team with genuine Super Bowl aspirations a few months ago. Below, we look at the factors that have hurt the Ravens – and the chances of those factors changing for the better.InjuriesIt’s been a Season From Hell for the Ravens. Injuries have been everywhere and constant. At various points this season they have been without Lamar Jackson (QB), Patrick Ricard (FB), Ronnie Stanley (OT), Emery Jones Jr (OT), Chidobe Awuzie (CB), Tavius Robinson (LB), Robert Longerbeam (CB), Bilhal Kone (CB), Ar’Darius Washington (S), Roquan Smith (LB) and Nnamdi Madubuike (DL). Some have missed weeks; others months. Their injury report has looked like an All-Pro ballot, and there have been weeks when they have fielded a practice-squad defense.Awuzie and Smith are expected back this week. Jackson’s status is up in the air. But the linchpin of the defense, Madubuike, won’t be returning. He is out for the season with a neck injury. Madubuieke is not a one-on-one game-wrecker, but he’s essential toBaltimore’s blitzing style. Without him, the Ravens cannot manufacture pressure the same way and have to rely on an aging Kyle Van Noy and a crop of rookies to score hits on quarterbacks. Even as others return, losing Madubuieke could prove to be the Jenga piece that topples everything.Chances of improvement:6/10 – some players will return but losing Madubuieke is a huge blow.Russell Wilson hits back at ‘classless’ former coach Sean Payton after Jaxson Dart jabRead moreQuarterbackThere’s no mystery here. With Jackson, the Ravens’ offense is a machine. Without him, they are impotent. Jackson has missed the last two games with a hamstring injury, and it’s unclear if he will return in time to face the Bears.With Jackson in the lineup this year, Baltimore’s offense has a 46% success rate, 11th in the league. That’s not MVP-level Lamar, but it’s good enough to win any game and compete in this year’s middling AFC. Without Jackson, the Ravens’ offense has collapsed. Since his injury, the Ravens have thethird-worst offensein the league by efficiency. Backup quarterback Cooper Rush led the team to 13 total pointsin his two starts before being replaced by third-stringer Snoop Huntley against the Rams.Jackson returned to practice on Wednesday and is expected to return on Sunday, barring a setback. At minimum, his return will give the Ravens an upper-tier offense. But there are still underlying flaws with the unit. The offensive line has glaring deficiencies, leaving Jackson to do much of the heavy lifting. Jackson’s mobility and smarts have helped mask pass protection problems that were exposed with Rush at quarterback. Jackson’s threat as a runner will help raise the floor of the rushing game, but the line has struggled to push people off the ball all season.The run game fuels everything the Ravens want to do on offense. Given Jackson’s threat, the Ravens have nestled into the top half of the league in rushing efficiency every year that he’s been a starter. This year, it has been too boom-or-bust. Derrick Henry has coughed up multiple fumbles, and the offensive line has gifted too many free shots at running backs. After totaling just 23 carries for 75 yards across weeks four and five, Henry went for 24 carries and 122 yards in Week 6 against the Rams – his first 100-yard game since Week 1 against the hapless Bills defense. That’s encouraging. But with or without Jackson, the Ravens running backs have still been hit at or behind the line of scrimmage at a 20% clip, one of the highest rates in the league.Jacksonshouldbe a cure-all. He’s aone-man offensewho can raise the level of everyone around him. At worst, he should vault the Ravens into a 25 points per game unit. And that should be enough to give the Ravens a chance to win every game moving forward. If they are forced to crack the 30-point threshold, though, they will need the offensive line to coalesce and Henry to hold on to the ball.Chances of improvement:9/10 – Jackson will almost certainly be back and is one of the best players in the league when healthy. Whether that makes up for deficiencies elsewhere remains to be seen.View image in fullscreenJohn Harbaugh’s defense has struggled this season.Photograph: David Tulis/UPI/ShutterstockDefense30 points a week could be necessary. While the Ravens’ offense has been inconsistent, the defense has been unambiguously bad. They cannot stop the run, rush the passer or cover. Injuries have played a significant role, but they’re not the only reason the group has slipped to the foot of the league.Seven weeks in, the Ravens have the NFL’slowest-ranked defense. They have theweakest run defensein the league. They rank 28th in pressure rate and 31st in sack rate, according to Next Gen Stats. Only the Commanders have had more coverage busts this season, per PFF. Taken together, those three amount to the 31st pass defense in the league, ahead of only the Dolphins. The Dolphins!Fingers can be pointed at the injury report, but a chunk of the blame should also fall on the coaching staff. Last season, the Ravensfaced similar issues. They struggled to get lined up or to execute basic plays. But their offense kept them in enough games that they could turn things around by the midpoint of the season, evolving into one of the better defenses in the league over the second half of the year. Those same early-season failures have returned: an allergy to tackling and defenders failing to understand their assignments.Offseason pickups haven’t moved the needle, either. Rookies Malaki Starks, Mike Green and Teddye Buchanan have looked lost. Jaire Alexander, an All-Pro in Green Bay, looks cooked.Despite the mess, Harbaugh has stuck by defensive coordinator Zach Orr, refusing to strip him of play-calling duties. Last year, the Ravens brought in former coordinator Dean Pees to help advise Orr. The group made significant changes that helped spark the midseason about-face. Pees is no longer on staff, and the same problems that plagued Orr’s unit last season have returned, with a crop of injuries on top of the structural flaws.The Ravens have made an in-season move to try to level up the group, acquiring safety Alohi Gilman in a trade with the Chargers for pass-rusher Odafe Oweh. It’s a savvy deal. On paper, letting Oweh go looks like a ding to an already banal pass-rush. But swapping Oweh for Gilman was a two-for-one trade, allowing the Ravens to upgrade their deep safety position and move Kyle Hamilton closer to the line of scrimmage.Since he entered the league, Hamilton has been themost effective blitzerin the NFL. When the defense faltered last season, the Ravens moved Hamilton from his typical role around the box back to deep safety. It worked. Now, with the front struggling, adding Gilman allows them to push him back into an attack role closer to the line.Hamilton bouncing between roles as a blitzer and slot corner should help elevate the Ravens in two crucial areas. They still lack the juice to win up front without blitzing. But if they win on Sunday, they could go hunting for extra veteran help on the trade market to offset the loss of Oweh.Chances of improvement:4/10 – The Gilman trade has worked but this is a unit with deep flaws.LuckLooking at the schedule, the Ravens probablyneed to win seven of their next eight games. They host the Bears, then face three road games in Miami, Minnesota and Cleveland. After that, it’s a home stand against the Jets, Bengals and Steelers before they face the Bengals on the road. With Jackson back, the Ravens are likely to be favored in all eight games. But theNFLis weird. Teams lose games they’re expected to win. Fortune comes into play: a bad officiating call, the bounce of a ball, a missed kick or another injury could be enough to end Baltimore’s postseason hopes.Playing in the AFC North will help. Joe Burrow is not expected to return for Cincinnati until after Christmas, and may be shut down before then if the Bengals are clearly out of the playoff race. The Steelers lead the division but are hardly a juggernaut. And the Browns, despite an outstanding defense, have the lousiest offense in football. In another division, the Ravens’ odds would be narrower. But if Jackson returns to full health, the Ravens could rip off eight-straight wins to put them in a position to win the North in the final three weeks.Those final three games will be tricky. The Ravens host the Patriots before traveling to the Packers and Steelers, which could be a one-off game for the division crown. But to get to that position, they cannot afford another slip-up against a beatable team.No team has ever had the same quarterback-coach combination for at least five years and then won the Super Bowl for the first time with that duo. This is the eighth year for Jackson and Harbaugh. Time isn’t just running out; it’s nearly gone. Harbaugh’s future may hinge on Sunday.If the Ravens can put a run together and make the playoffs, they will be one of the most dangerous teams in a weak AFC field. If they sputter to the end of the campaign, they will be looking at a hard reset.Chances of improvement:5/10 – The whole point about luck is you can’t predict it. More importantly: if you’re relying on it, you’re not a very good team.Explore more on these topicsBaltimore RavensNFLUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Chauncey Billups, a Hall of Fame player who is now coach of the Portland Trail Blazers, was arrested in connection with a poker operation linked to the mafia, while Miami Heat star Terry Rozier is accused of taking part in a scheme to manipulate games.“Today, we are here in New York to announce a historic arrest across a wide sweeping criminal enterprise,” the FBI director, Kash Patel, said at anews conferenceon Thursday unveiling the charges. “This is an illegal gambling operation and sports rigging operation that spanned the course of years.”Federal prosecutors unsealed two indictments on Thursday, and announced that they had arrested “over 30 individuals” across multiple states as part of a federal investigation into “sports rigging” and illegal gambling operations that authorities say involved the Bonanno, Gambino, Genovese and Lucchese crime families.Patel said on Thursday that defendants are facing charges including wire fraud, money laundering, extortion, robbery and illegal gambling“The fraud is mind-boggling,” Patel said. “We’re talking about tens of millions of dollars in fraud and theft and robbery.”Joseph Nocella, the US attorney for the eastern district of New York, said on Thursday the first indictment involves sports betting and six defendants whom he said were involved in a sports-betting scheme that “exploited confidential information about NationalBasketballAssociation athletes and teams”.The New York police commissioner, Jessica Tisch, said the alleged operation centered on “professional basketball, where players and associates allegedly used inside information to manipulate prop bets on major sports betting platforms”.Tisch described an alleged March 2024 incident involving Rozier, currently a guard for the Miami Heat but who was then playing for the Charlotte Hornets.Tisch said Rozier “allegedly let others close to him noted know that he planned to leave the game early with a supposed injury”.“Using that information, members of the group placed more than $200,000 in wagers on his under statistics,” she alleged, adding: “Rozier exited the game after just nine minutes, and those bets paid out, generating tens of thousands of dollars in profit.”“The proceeds were later delivered to his home,” she alleged.The second indictment, authorities said, “involves 31 defendants” including Billups and the formerNBAplayer Damon Jones.The defendants are alleged to “have participated in a nationwide scheme to rig illegal poker games”.According to prosecutors, the alleged illegal rigged poker games began in 2019 and occurred across the US, including in the Hamptons, Las Vegas, Miami and Manhattan, and were backed by the Bonanno, Gambino and Genovese crime families.The defendants,prosecutors said on Thursday, allegedly used hi-tech cheating technology to “steal millions of dollars from victims in underground poker games that were secretly fixed”.‘It’s an addiction’: NBA’s ties to gambling trouble players past and presentRead moreOfficials said the operation targeted victims, known as “fish”, who were “lured to participate in these rigged games by the chance to play alongside former professional athletes” , who, he said, were referred to as “face cards”.The so-called “face cards”, officials said, included Billups and Jones.“What the victims didn’t know is that everybody else at the poker game, from the dealer to the players, including the face cards, were in on the scam,” Nocella said. “Once the game was under way, the defendants fleeced the victims out of tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars per game.”Prosecutors claim that the defendants used “very sophisticated cheating technologies” including rigged shuffling machines, poker chip tray analyzers, special contact lenses and an X-ray poker table that could read cards.The Bonanno, Gambino and Genovese crime families, Nocella said, “had pre existing control over non-rigged illegal poker games around New York City” and so “as a result, they also became involved in the rigged poker games, helping to organize the games, and taking a cut of the proceedings and working to enforce the collection of debts”.Authorities say that the defendants “laundered their proceeds, including through cash exchanges, use of multiple shell companies and through cryptocurrency transfers as part of the scheme”.Nocella also alleged that the defendants and their co-conspirators “also committed acts of violence, including the gunpoint robbery of a person in order to obtain a rigged shuffling machine and extortions that were perpetrated against victims in order to ensure that they repaid their gambling debt”.Nocella emphasized that all defendants are presumed innocent until they are proven guilty in a court of law.On Thursday, the NBAissued a statementsaying it was reviewing the indictments. It said Rozier and Billups had been placed on immediate leave. “We take these allegations with the utmost seriousness, and the integrity of our game remains our top priority,” the organization said.Rozier was taken into custody in Orlando early Thursday morning. His team did not immediately comment on the arrest.Rozier’s lawyer, Jim Trusty, said prosecutors “appear to be taking the word of spectacularly incredible sources rather than relying on actual evidence of wrongdoing. Trusty previously told ESPN that Rozier was told that an initial investigation determined he did nothing wrong after he met with NBA andFBIofficials in 2023.The case was brought by the same US attorney’s office in Brooklyn that previously prosecuted theex-NBA player Jontay Porter. The former Toronto Raptors center pleaded guilty to charges that he withdrew early from games, claiming illness or injury, so that those in the know could win while betting on him to underperform expectations. The NBA laterbanned Porter from the league for life.A game involving Rozier that has been in question was played on 23 March 2023, a matchup between the Hornets and the New Orleans Pelicans. Rozier played the first 10 minutes of that game – and not only did he not return that night, citing a foot issue, but he did not play again that season. Charlotte had eight games remaining and were not in playoff contention, so it did not seem particularly unusual that Rozier was shut down for the season’s final games.In that 23 March game, Rozier finished with five points, four rebounds and two assists in that opening period – a productive quarter, but well below his usual total output for a full game.Rozierhas $160m in career earnings, and is in the final year of a four-year $96m contract. Billups was a five-time All-Star during his playing career and won a championship with the Detroit Pistons in 2004. He retired in 2014 and has been Portland head coach since 2021.Explore more on these topicsNBAUS sportsBasketballGamblingFBInewsShareReuse this content"

However her performance was immediately questioned by many in the athletics world who felt it was too good to be true.Marathon world record holder Ruth Chepngetich suspended over banned substanceRead moreBut while the 31-year-old will not be able to race again until 2028, she will be allowed to keep her world record because her positive drugs test came after her run in Chicago. That will leave a sour taste in the mouth for many people. However, the AIU chair, David Howman, insisted that the case proved that “nobody is above the rules”.“While disappointing for those who put their trust in this athlete, this is how the system is supposed to work,” he added.Chepngetich had been due to run in this year’s LondonMarathonbut pulled out just days before after a urine test in March found an estimated concentration of 3,800ng/mL of the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) in her system – far above the legal limit of 20ng/mL.Diuretics may be abused to mask the presence in urine of other prohibited substances. However, when interviewed by AIU investigators in April, Chepngetich was unable to provide an explanation for her positive test.At a subsequent interview in July, the AIU said it then confronted her with evidence acquired from her mobile telephone indicating a reasonable suspicion that her positive test may have been intentional.Shortly afterwards, Chepngetich wrote to the AIU to state that she now recalled that she had been taken ill two days before the positive test – but had forgotten to mention it.“She claimed that she had experienced symptoms of sweating, weakness and tachycardia and, since she knew that her housemaid had experienced similar symptoms, asked her housemaid for the medicine that she had been taking,” the AIU investigation states.View image in fullscreenRuth Chepngetich of Kenya crosses the finish line to win the 2024 Chicago marathon.Photograph: Michael Reaves/Getty ImagesInvestigators found such claims to be “hardly credible” and asked for her potential suspension to be increased from two years to four. Chepngetich then accepted that she had committed an anti-doping rule violation and was banned for three years.That, though, may not be the end of the matter. The AIU said it had found screenshots on Chepngetich’s phone about the banned drug testosterone and “messages related to unidentified third parties working on ‘programs’ possibly related to doping”. “The case regarding the positive test for HCTZ has been resolved, but the AIU will continue to investigate the suspicious material recovered from Chepngetich phone to determine if any other violations have occurred,” said the head of the AIU, Brett Clothier.“In the meantime, all Chepngnetich’s achievements and records predating the 14 March 2025 sample stand.”Explore more on these topicsMarathonAthleticsDrugs in sportUS sportsKenyanewsShareReuse this content"

M-V-P!” in the teams’ season opener, getting 40 points and 15 rebounds in the Spurs’ 125-92 rout of theDallas Maverickson Wednesday night.Cooper Flagg can’t escape the ghost of the Great White Hope | Lee EscobedoRead moreFlagg, the No 1 overall pick in this year’s draft, was the talk of the Dallas opener going into the game. Coming out, the talk was of Wembanyama, who offered a reminder why he was the top overall choice just two years ago.The 7ft 4in Frenchman was playing in the regular season for the first time since deep vein thrombosis, a blood clot condition in his shoulder, required surgery and limited him to 46 games last campaign.“I think we all knew he was going to be assertive,” Spurs coach Mitch Johnson said. “He’s been out eight months. He’s been waiting for this probably longer and more thorough than anybody else. You saw him take the moment and play spectacular.”Flagg scored for the Spurs before he scored for himself, getting called for goaltending in the second quarter. His first bucket finally came on the first possession of the second half as the 18-year-old finished with 10 points and 10 rebounds.Flagg is the second-youngest player to start in his debut, two days older than LeBron James was 22 years ago.“He’s still a rookie,” said 13-year veteran Anthony Davis, who opened his first full season with the Mavericks after his trade from the Lakers last February. “I’m not sure he’s a social media guy or not. But everything was No 1 pick Cooper Flagg and Wemby matchup. So you’re hearing it. I’m not sure if it got to him, but it’s first-game jitters when it’s time for the real thing.”Flagg didn’t even attempt a shot in the last 22 minutes of the first half after putting up a pair in the opening two minutes, including a near-dunk on a fast break alley-oop from Davis. The ball started to go down but came back out. He hit a jumper from the free throw line for his first points, and hit a tough fadeaway for his second bucket. Flagg was 4 of 13 from the field and had three turnovers.“I was excited, but I’m excited to go on,” Flagg said. “Obviously, it hurts, the first loss being like that. Try to look forward to the next one, turn the page and get ready. We know we’ve got a lot better than that. Staying positive and staying ready.”Asked about his performance, Flagg was blunt. “Not great,” he said. “Obviously, didn’t play incredibly well, but we’ve got to move past it, turn our focus and start looking toward Friday [against the Washington Wizards].”Wembanyama, meanwhile, was dominant. The 21-year old had seven of San Antonio’s 12 dunks as the Spurs outscored the Mavericks 68-26 in the paint and outshot Dallas 58%-37%. Wembanyama was 15 of 21 from the field and had three blocks.“We needed to make a statement in the locker room. I feel like I needed to make a statement to my teammates,” Wembanyama said. “It’s also just the beginning because there’s so much more I want to add to my game. Some things take time and maturity.”Wembanyama repeatedly went right at Davis, a five-timeNBAAll-Defensive Team member. After his dunk late in the second quarter, he hit a jumper while drawing Davis’ fourth foul. In the second half, he dribbled at and around him for a left-handed slam. Davis was brought to Dallas for defense in a deal that cost the Mavericks a generational offensive star in his prime in Luka Dončić.Wembanyama’s performance was an eye-opener for Flagg, but something he was expecting.“He’s incredible,” Flagg said. “He’s a different player. You can’t know what it’s like until you’re on the court with him. It’s something I’ve never seen before. He was great tonight, but we’ve to do a better job of trying to take away some of his looks. You can’t foul him as much as we did.”The 6ft 9in Flagg was technically the starting point guard as the Mavericks await the return of Kyrie Irving, which is likely months away as he recovers from a torn ACL.Explore more on these topicsNBAVictor WembanyamaDallas MavericksSan Antonio SpursBasketballUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

The contract is expected to be the last of his professional career.Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed in Miami’s announcement on Thursday, but Messi has been MLS’s highest-paid player by a distance since joining the club in the summer of 2023. His first deal paid him over $20m per year in guaranteed compensation – more the total payroll of about two-thirds of the 30-team league in 2025. His deal also includes equity in the club upon his retirement as a player.The extension will theoretically keep Messi under contract until he is 41 years old.Allow Instagram content?This article includes content provided byInstagram.

We brought the best player to have ever played the game to our city. That shows our commitment to Miami, but it also shows Leo’s commitment to the city, to the club, and to the game. He’s still as committed as he’s ever been and he still wants to win.”The deal had been in negotiations for months and accomplishes a key goal of Inter Miami owner Jorge Mas, who has said he wants Messi on the team to inaugurate the team’s new stadium, which is due to open for the 2026 season. Inter Miami’s Instagram post announcing the extension shows Messi signing his contract amid the construction site for the new stadium.Since beginning life as an expansion team in 2020 and throughout the Messi era so far,Miami have playedat the 21,500-capacity Chase Stadium in nearby Fort Lauderdale.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Inter Miami have become the destination of choice for Messi’s ex-teammates looking for another run with the Argentinian superstar. This includes ex-Barcelona teammates Jordi Alba, Luis Suárez, and Sergio Busquets, along with Argentina teammate Rodrigo De Paul. Javier Mascherano, Messi’s former teammate with Argentina and Barcelona, is in his first year as Miami’s head coach.On the field, Messi has thrived in MLS. The World Cup winner has scored 71 goals with 37 assists in 82 appearances, leading Miami to the 2023 Leagues Cup title and the 2024 Supporters’ Shield. Miami opens their 2025 MLS Cup playoffs journey on Friday with a best-of-three series against Nashville SC. MLS Cup remains the club’s last hope for a trophy in 2025, with the Herons having missed out on the Supporters’ Shield. They were also eliminated from the Leagues Cup, the Concacaf Champions Cup, and the Club World Cup.Messi was named the MLS MVP in 2024 despite missing nearly half the season with an ankle injury, and is all but certain to win the award again in 2025. If that happens, Messi will become the first player to win the award twice since Predrag “Preki” Radosavljevic did so in 1997 and 2003 for the Kansas City Wizards (now known as Sporting Kansas City).Messi is expected to join Argentina for the 2026 World Cup in the United States, Mexico and Canada, having helped the reigning champions qualify for the tournament with relative ease.Explore more on these topicsMLSInter MiamiLionel MessiUS sportsShareReuse this content"

Ahead of Sunday’s edition of El Clásico between Barcelona and Real Madrid, the two clubs won their midweek matches. Real Madrid’s opponents were Juventus, in the type of heavyweight clash the Champions League’s rejig into a 36-team group stage was supposed to throw up on a regular basis. Wednesday’s meeting fell short of classic encounters like 2003’s meeting of Madrid’s Luís Figo and Zinedine Zidane with Juve’s Pavel Nedvěd and Alessandro Del Piero. In 2025, Juventus are not the force of yore, though they made Madrid sweat. The sole goal came from Jude Bellingham, England’s great enigma.Barcelona meanwhile, continue to show the depth of their La Masia youth academy. Fermín López, 22, scored a hat-trick, while 17-year-old attacking midfielder Pedro “Dro” Fernández supplied an assist on his Champions League debut in a6-1 drubbing of Olympiakos. Last weekend, Toni Fernández, six months younger than Pedro, started against Girona in La Liga. Each may play some part in Sunday’s big match, with Madrid two points ahead of their eternal rivals.If Tebas had only listened he might have got his La Liga game abroad | Sid LoweRead moreBayern Munich. Another European giant is enjoying a flowering of youth. On Tuesday, Bayern’s coach, Vincent Kompany signed a three-year extension after his side’s faultless start to the Bundesliga campaign. The club hierarchy approves of Kompany’s blooding of players like Lennart Karl and Wisdom Mike, two more 17-year-olds. Karl, whose muscular 5ft 6in frame recalls 1990s German great Thomas Hässler, completed a solo effort with a fine finish to become his club’s youngest ever Champions League scorer in a 4-0 thrashing of Club Brugge.“He simply has balls,” said teammate and midfielder Aleksandar Pavlović, who, at 21, is another youngster Kompany is trusting. Meanwhile, Harry Kane continued an incredible scoring run, and has now notched 20 goals in 12 games across all competitions this season. He has only failed to score in one of those games, and in that one he registered two assists. Meanwhile, Luis Díaz, the summer’s big signing, scored his first Champions League goal for Bayern. Díaz is making his best ever start to a season with seven goals and four assists from 12 matches.Premier League strength.This week saw a deluge of goals – 71 over two nights, 43 on Tuesday. This makes for a great highlights package, but questions of competitive balance may be raised. Five Premier League clubs enjoyed comfortable wins, including Liverpoolending their losing runby winning 5-1 at Eintracht Frankfurt. Newcastlebeating Benfica 3-0and Chelsea’s5-1 win over Ajaxwere punishing defeats for two classic clubs from the European Cup era. Arsenal’s4-0 defeat of Atlético Madridwas perhaps most striking. Mikel Arteta’s team were too powerful for Diego Simeone’s to withstand. The breakthrough, a Gabriel header, was their 10th set-piece goal this season.As Manchester Citywon 2-0 at Villarreal, Erling Haaland extended his scoring run to 12 matches, closing in on Robert Lewandowski’s run of 15 in 2021 – the best such mark this century. Letting the English side down wasTottenham’s 0-0 draw at Monaco, who took 21 shots on Guglielmo Vicario’s goal. A face in the crowd on Wednesday was Paul Pogba, yet to begin his comeback at Monaco from his drugs ban after another setback in training.Dazn targets rights for Champions League in latest football move involving Saudi ArabiaRead morePlayer of the weekDennis Man, PSV Eindhoven.The week’s most striking result was PSV’s 6-2 defeat of Napoli, with US striker Ricardo Pepi scoring as a substitute. It was Man, a Romanian winger, at the centre of things. He had two goals and a series of dribbles into the heart of the Italian champions’ defence. Man’s second goal, his team’s fourth, was the highlight, drilled with his left foot. The first was a delicate finish.“As I’ve said many times before, you shouldn’t write players off after a few weeks,” said the PSV coach Peter Bosz of a player criticised since signing from Parma.They said it“The biggest exception for me today compared to the other games we’ve played was the playing style of our opponent. We got some energy out of the moments we could press them, which in the last four or five games we played we were not able to press the opponent because the ball wasn’t on the ground, it was in the air.”– Liverpool manager Arne Slot comments on the win in Frankfurt, and inadvertently issues Brentford manager Keith Andrews his tactical plan for the team’s game on Saturday.

It feels like they still have room for improvement.”– France 1998 World Cup winner Emmanuel Petit, speaking on RMC after the defending champions won 7-2 at Bayer Leverkusen.Looking aheadThe fourth week throws up a real heavyweight clash as PSG face Bayern. The Parisians are not having it their way in Ligue 1, where Roberto De Zerbi’s Marseille are leaders; Marseille’s loss to Sporting Club on Wednesday had the Italian fuming. Bayern, after recent turbulence, are back dominating the Bundesliga. This one might well be a dry run for a higher stakes meeting in the latter stages.Real Madrid v Liverpool fits a similar bill – Xabi Alonso facing Slot, with the Basque Real Madrid boss having been many people’s pick to succeed Jürgen Klopp. In the Champions League era, Madrid have beaten Liverpool in two finals, though a 2-0 Liverpool win last November at Anfield in the group stage loosened Carlo Ancelotti’s tenure, a night when Kylian Mbappé and Mohamed Salah both missed penalties.In the early 1990s Sir John Hall, the Newcastle chair, revealed a dream for his club to become a “team full of Geordies”, modeled on Athletic Club’s Basque-only recruitment policy. That never came to pass, especially not today. Eddie Howe’s squad is a league of nations, with only Dan Burn, teenage midfielder Lewis Miley and reserve keeper Mark Gillespie fitting Hall’s bill. The clubs meet at St James’ after heartening wins this week.

Elland Road is a wonderfully atmospheric ground but given the local traffic congestion, getting there, particularly on a Friday evening, is invariably tortuous. The prospect of exacerbating that gridlock dictates that the club’s plans to expand Elland Road to 53,000 appear in potential jeopardy. Leeds city council will make a final, delayed, decision on the project on 27 November but, with 65% of the team’s fans driving to matches, there is concern about the inevitable extra traffic chaos. The club hope to reduce the percentage of match-bound car travel to 51%, but to do that public transport needs to improve; Leeds is the biggest city in western Europe without a metro system. Cycling? Anyone familiar with the area’s topography knows it is not a realistic option for the vast majority of fans.Louise TaylorLeeds v West Ham, Friday 8pm BST2Guiu can shine in Black Cats reunionMarc Guiu started the season at Sunderland, having found himself out of Enzo Maresca’s plans and needing to learn about life in the Premier League after a slow first year in England. As a teenager arriving from Barcelona’s La Masia, it was not a surprise that the striker needed time to adapt even if he made a few cameos along the way before the Black Cats came calling. Then Liam Delap got injured and Chelsea were in a bit of a vice, so brought back Guiu. Sunderland gave him two substitute appearances in the league and he scored only in the Carabao Cup exit to Huddersfield, suggesting he might not be primed for life at the top of the table. Since then, however, he has shown Maresca what he can do, playing a half in the win over Nottingham Forest andscoring against Ajax. He will want to continue on this trajectory.Will UnwinChelsea vSunderland, Saturday 3pm BST3On-song Newcastle give Silva much to fearFulham and their manager, Marco Silva, are unlikely to be deceived by the table. It shows that they are only one point behind Newcastle in its bottom half but, as José Mourinho emphasised this week, the latter’s position is hugely deceptive. Granted, Eddie Howe’s side have started the season slowly but they have kept seven clean sheets in 12 games in all competitions and, when the mood takes them, are almost unplayable. Inlosing 3-0 at St James’ Parkin the Champions League on Tuesday night Benfica did not perform badly. They restricted the centre-forward Nick Woltemade to one touch inside their box but, ultimately, they could not handle Howe’s wingers, Anthony Gordon in particular. “We could not compete with their horsepower, their intensity, speed and physicality,” said Mourinho. “This tells me a lot about Newcastle’s true level. They are a team of giants and they have four lightning-fast wingers.” Silva, a compatriot and a friend of Mourinho, has reason to be worried, particularly as Howe says there is “much more to come” from his reshaped side.LTNewcastle vFulham, Saturday 3pm BSTView image in fullscreenNick Woltemade will be seeking to get back on the scoresheet against Fulham.Photograph: Allstar Picture Library Ltd/Ed Sykes/Apl/Sportsphoto4Manchester United spy a (sort of) trebleYou have to rewind to August 2024 for the last time Manchester United won three league games in a row, when Erik ten Hag’s men carried momentum from May into the new season witha victory against Fulhamthanks to Joshua Zirkzee’s 87th-minute winner. After Sunday’s2-1 downing of Liverpool, which followed the 2-0 defeat of Sunderland, victory over Brighton at Old Trafford would match the feat. It would also suggest the start of a revival (maybe) under Ruben Amorim, but a loss would be morale-sapping and revive the doubts regarding the Portuguese’s skills.Jamie JacksonManchester United v Brighton, Saturday 5.30pm BST5A chance for Salah to reassert himselfAfter ending their four-game losing streakin Frankfurt, Liverpool need to reignite their title defence. Chelsea, Crystal Palace and Manchester United have secured 2-1 victories in Arne Slot’s past three domestic outings. The most notable change on Wednesday was leaving Mohamed Salah on the bench. The Egyptian has not scored for his club in more than a month, when he netted in the3-2 win over Atlético Madridon 17 September. He has not looked at his sharpest since the start of the season and it is understandable that, at 33, regardless of his natural fitness, he will need to be more carefully managed if Slot and Liverpool are to get the best out of him. A cameo in the Champions League kept him ticking over, although the game was very much done by the time he entered the pitch. Slot needs to decide whether to reinstall him into the starting lineup, which seems likely consideringAlexander Isak’s injuryand the prospect of being able to rest him for the visit of Crystal Palace in the Carabao Cup on Wednesday.WUBrentford vLiverpool, Saturday 8pm BST6Kroupi can take centre stage for CherriesEvanilson looks unlikely to return for third-placed Bournemouth’s match against Nottingham Forest. Instead, Eli Junior Kroupi, fresh from hisdouble at Crystal Palace, will almost certainly keep his place in the side. The 19-year-old has three goals in five league appearances for Bournemouth and looks like another smart acquisition, made somewhat easier by sharing an owner with Lorient, from where the striker was bought. A return to the Breton club on loan last season resulted in 13 goals in as many games; money cannot buy that level of confidence. For a young player, he offers great composure in front of goal and quickly settles into a match when coming off the bench. Andoni Iraola knows he has an asset on his hands and that Kroupi needs minutes to develop. The striker will want to give his head coach reasons to keep starting him, whether Evanilson is available or not.WUskip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The 15-year-old who joined Arsenal in 2015 from local side Billericay Town – where his father, Rob, used to be a director – became the second youngest player in Premier League history this season and is understood to have attracted interest from several other top clubs. But his future at Arsenal was never seriously in doubt during negotiations that were handled by his father, with the scholarship terms due to begin next season after Dowman turns 16 on 31 December before he will be able to sign a professional contract when he is 17. After a busy but successful week for Arsenal, he could make a fourth appearance of the season againstCrystal Palaceon Sunday.Ed AaronsArsenal v Crystal Palace, Sunday 2pm GMT8Cash showing value at VillaHow many times have you replayed thatotherworldly Matty Cash ping? His sumptuous first-time pass to Lucas Digne proved the catalyst for Emi Buendía’s glorious winnerat Tottenham last weekend; Digne’s control and layoff were equally sublime, too. When Villa have struggled, Cash has been an easy target for criticism and there has long been an expectation that Unai Emery will try to upgrade at right-back. But the Villa manager regards Cash as a reliable performer and has found it tricky to identify a realistic alternative who would represent an obvious improvement. Cash was wanted by his former club Nottingham Forest in the summer but Villa recognise his value, with the Poland full-back expected to sign a new contract in the coming months. Morgan Rogers, another player the club are keen to tie down, is the only one of Cash’s teammates to have played more league minutes this season.Ben FisherAston Villa vManchester City, Sunday 2pm GMT9Huge pressure on downbeat WolvesIt is a good job messages on the WhatsApp supporters channel Wolves launched this week will be permitted only one way. Plenty of fans are angry, others are apathetic, and many are resigned to relegation after taking two points from their opening eight matches. Wolves have failed to win any of their first eight league games for a second straight season, the first team to achieve that unwanted feat since Sunderland in 2015-16 and 2016-17, when the Black Cats finished bottom. Stamford of the Southern LeaguePremier LeagueCentral are the only other team in English football’s top seven tiers without a win this campaign. The visit of Burnley on Sunday feels bigger than the proverbial six-pointer for Vítor Pereira’s side. “We understand the frustration, and we just have to take it on the chin as players until we turn it around,” said the defender Matt Doherty.BFWolves vBurnley, Sunday 2pm GMTView image in fullscreenVítor Pereira, Wolves’s head coach, finds himself in a sticky situation.Photograph: Richard Lee/Shutterstock10Everton rebuild still a tough task for MoyesSean Dyche’s return to management this week offered a little reminder of how far Everton have moved on since the grimmest period of his tenure. That was not the sequence of one win in 11 dreadful league matches that cost Dyche the Everton job in January but the financial turmoil that preceded it and could easily have resulted in relegation but for the former manager’s calm leadership. Everton are unrecognisable under David Moyes and The Friedkin Group and could go level on points with Tottenham should they inflict a first away defeat of the season on Thomas Frank’s team. Moyes knows improving Everton is an open-ended task but, with a difficult assignment against Spurs afterlast weekend’s defeat at Manchester City, he believes perspective on the recovery is required. “We are only just out of having 12 players out of contract, with PSR [profitability and sustainability regulations] issues, and we’re just done with that. We’ve moved to a new stadium. I would hope that if it didn’t all go to plan folk would say: ‘Well, there’s a few mitigating circumstances.’ Certainly this year. But I don’t want to use any of that as an excuse. I want us to try and challenge and the players know that as well.”Andy HunterEverton v Tottenham, Sunday 4.30pm GMTPosTeamPGDPts1Arsenal812192Man City811163AFC Bournemouth83154Liverpool83155Chelsea87146Tottenham Hotspur87147Sunderland83148Crystal Palace84139Man Utd8-11310Brighton811211Aston Villa801212Everton801113Brentford8-11014Newcastle80915Fulham8-4816Leeds8-6817Burnley8-6718Nottm Forest8-10519West Ham8-12420Wolverhampton8-112Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueTen things to look out for this weekendNewcastle UnitedFulhamBrentfordLiverpoolBournemouthNottingham ForestfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Sean Dyche succeeded where Ange Postecoglou had failed so miserably, winning at the first time of asking to get Nottingham Forest’s Europa League campaign truly up and running. “Forest are back,” rejoiced the home support, who chanted the name of their third head coach of the season en route to handing Porto their first defeat of the season. Cue the victory-lap fireworks dazzling above Trent Bridge.Perhaps most remarkably, this was also Forest’s first clean sheet since April. It all must have made pretty satisfying viewing for the owner, Evangelos Marinakis, applauding the goals from his seat in the directors’ box and last seen scarpering from the stadium midway through Postecoglou’s final game. Even the VAR gods were on Dyche’s side, both Forest goals stemming from interventions, with Morgan Gibbs-White and Igor Jesus scoring a penalty in each half.Mateta fluffs his lines as Crystal Palace lose in Conference League against LarnacaRead more“The A Block is still the A Block,” Dyche said of the hardcore fans in the Main Stand, “if they back you, that’s always a good thing.” For Dyche, this is a job that, as he put it, rounds the circle after he began his career here as an apprentice under Brian Clough, whom the stand opposite the dugouts is named after. By the end Dyche was able to drink in the occasion. “I’ve waited a long time for that moment,” he said. “I wanted to stand there and absorb it. I’ve learnt in life that sometimes you have to slow your thinking down and take it in and put it in the memory.”The last time Forest won a game in European competition, against Lyon in the Uefa Cup in November 1995, Dyche’s longstanding assistants Ian Woan and Steve Stone were on the pitch. As Mull of Kintyre reverberated around the stadium before kick-off, a renewed optimism was detectable. At full time Rockin’ All Over The World blared over the speakers for the first time in a couple of months. Fans singing Dyche’s name seemed pertinent given the struggles faced by his predecessor. “It is nice when they support you from the off,” he said. “If they can accept me and my staff, that’s got to be a bonus and hopefully it will fast-track the feeling around the ground.”Dyche, in a blue club tracksuit, cut an animated figure on the touchline but, save for a glance at the watch, was unmoved when Forest seized the lead through Gibbs-White; the spot-kick was awarded after Jan Bednarek, previously of Southampton, was penalised for handling a cross towards Igor Jesus, one of three changes from Postecoglou’s final game. Gibbs-White took a couple of deep breaths and sent Diogo Costa, the penalty specialist wearing No 99 in thePortogoal, the wrong way. Marinakis applauded in the stands and the locals savoured the liftoff of another new era.View image in fullscreenIgor Jesus scores the second goal from the penalty spot to give Nottingham Forest a 2-0 victory against Porto.Photograph: Oli Scarff/AFP/Getty ImagesForest’s penalty was the first time Porto, unbeaten before arriving at the City Ground, had trailed all season. Francesco Farioli’s side oozed confidence from the first whistle, every outfield player but centre-back Jakub Kiwior lining up on halfway for kick-off. Forest, too, began on the front foot, Elliot Anderson blasting over inside a minute and Gibbs-White hunting down the ball. Gibbs-White’s post-match comments were telling. “I feel like I can finally breathe,” he said.Forest largely contained a free-scoring Porto side who had conceded just twice all season prior this trip. The only disappointment was the premature departure of Oleksandr Zinchenko who was forced off with a groin problem on the verge of half-time, Nicolò Savona arriving in his place. During the interval Forest paid tribute to Harley Pearce, son of club legend Stuart,who died in a tractor crashlast week.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Savona was initially booked for diving under pressure from Martim Fernandes but then the Romanian referee, Radu Petrescu, headed to the VAR monitor for a second look and he overturned his decision. Gibbs-White handed Igor Jesus the honours, the Brazil striker wellying the ball down the middle of goal.Every Forest player, except Matz Sels, joined the celebrations. Just like that, the mood has completely shifted. “I told the lads: ‘It is a start and there is a whole lot more work to go,’” Dyche said. “We can’t think that’s all the questions answered.”Explore more on these topicsEuropa LeagueNottingham ForestPortomatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Having comfortablybeaten Dynamo Kyivon their Conference League debut, the FA Cup winners had been expected to roll over their Cypriot counterparts in the club’s first home game in the main draw of a European competition.Instead Oliver Glasner’s side were handed a harsh lesson about what it takes to be successful at this level as a mistake from the teenage defender Jaydee Canvot on only his second start since joining in the summer allowed Larnaca to take a surprise lead before some stout defending kept Palace’s onslaught at bay. Perhaps this won’t be the procession that many had predicted after they weredemoted from the Europa League.Gibbs-White sparks win over Porto to give Nottingham Forest and Sean Dyche liftoffRead more“We made one mistake and they punished us,” said Glasner. “The players will learn from it. I know this group. It’s a frustrating night. On the other side, maybe the whole environment needed it to stay humble.”To mark the occasion, Palace’s fans unfurled a huge tifo before kick-off with a slight variation on the Dad’s Army theme tune and was no doubt aimed at Uefa. “We are the boys that will win your little game,” it read together with red and blue arrows advancing on Leipzig, where the final of this competition will be played.Palace certainly have a team capable of making it all the way. But question marks remain over whether their squad can cope with the rigours of a schedule of six games in 18 days before the next international break, with Glasner making only three changes from thethrilling draw against Bournemouthat the weekend as Adam Wharton and Daichi Kamada were rested.View image in fullscreenCrystal Palace’s No 14 Jean-Philippe Mateta had a frustrating evening.Photograph: Crystal Pix/MB Media/Getty ImagesJean-Philippe Mateta spurned a golden opportunity to win that with the last kick of the match and the France striker picked up where he left off when his effort from six yards bounced up on to the crossbar after 21 minutes following an unconvincing save from Zlatan Alomerovic. Larnaca were content to sit back and soak up the pressure despite thrashing Dutch side AZ 4-0 in their opening match. That is something that Palace will have to get used to in a competition where they will be expected to have the majority of possession. Mateta wasn’t far away on two occasions just before the break but there was a lack of intensity about the hosts without their first-choice midfield pulling the strings.Palace should have taken the lead straight after the restart when Maxence Lacroix somehow missed the target from a Will Hughes cross. They were made to pay immediately when Canvot gifted possession to Marcus Rohdén in his own half and fed Riad Bajic, whose shot arrowed into Dean Henderson’s top corner. Glasner immediately replaced Canvot with Eddie Nketiah and switched to a back four but Mateta still could not beat Alomerovic after being presented with another great chance from close range.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

AEK  continued in the ascendancy after the break to leave the bedraggled Scottish side languishing at the foot of the table with no points and a goal difference of minus seven. Thelin made two changes to the side that started in Paisley on Saturday as Topi Keskinen and Marko Lazetic replaced Gavin Molloy and Kevin Nisbet, while the former Hearts left-back James Penrice started for AEK.Despite a promising start from Aberdeen, AEK went ahead in the 11th minute as Aboubakary Koïta stepped away from Graeme Shinnie and fired a low left-footed strike across Dimitar Mitov and into the far corner from just outside the box. Aberdeen completely lost their way thereafter as AEK turned the screw.Shortly after defender Filipe Relvas headed against a post from a Penrice free-kick, the home side doubled their lead in the 18th minute. It came from a counterattack after the Aberdeen pair Stuart Armstrong and Jesper Karlsson both turned down inviting shooting opportunities, with Koïta slotting an angled shot beyond Mitov after being fed by Lazaros Rota.AEK’s third came when Niclas Eliasson produced a cool finish from 10 yards after the home side stole possession on the edge of the box from Jack Milne, who had been put in trouble by a needlessly risky pass from Mitov. Boos were audible from the travelling support at half-time but AEK’s dominance remained after the break and Razvan Marin produced an acrobatic close-range finish in after Frantzdy Pierrot’s effort rebounded off a post.Further goals in the closing 10 minutes from the substitutes Luka Jovic, who outfoxed Mitov from six yards, and Dereck Kutesa, who went clean through and finished clinically, completed a humiliating evening for the Dons and brought fresh pressure on Thelin.“We know it’s not acceptable … it was 6-0, but it could be more,” said Thelin. “Tonight, Athens exposed us and that’s what we have to learn from. So, sometimes, just hands up, they win, totally deserved.”PA MediaPhotograph: Louiza Vradi/REUTERSWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Wharton and Kamada were introduced but it felt like it wasn’t going to be Palace’s night when Nketiah could only produce an air shot with the goal gaping before Christantus Uche also failed to make contact with a Marc Guéhi cross late on. With a trip to face Premier League leaders Arsenal on Sunday and with not much time to recover, Glasner will hope that his players can put the disappointment of suffering only a third home defeat of 2025 behind them quickly.Explore more on these topicsConference LeagueCrystal PalaceAEK Larnacamatch reportsShareReuse this content"

It did, however, owe everything to context. Perhaps Sunday’sdismal loss at Dundeewas a Celtic nadir.They were much improved when claiming these valuable three points. They also earned them from a goal behind, demonstrating there is at least spirit within the camp presided over by Brendan Rodgers. With more efficiency in front of goal, Celtic would have won far more comfortably.Sturm Graz, who offered nothing after Celtic edged in front, closed with 10 men.Gibbs-White sparks win over Porto to give Nottingham Forest and Sean Dyche liftoffRead moreRodgers has cut a frustrated figure after summer transfer window inaction. It was no wonder then that he accentuated positives towards a squad who have generally failed to convince in this campaign. “I thought the performance was outstanding,” said Celtic’s manager. “We had tempo, speed and aggression, so I am really pleased. The progress in the team from the weekend was so good.”The latest chastening experiences for Scottish clubs in Europe had seen Rangers humbled in Brann and Aberdeen embarrassed by AEK Athens before Celtic kicked off. The aggregate there was 9-0. At present coefficient rate, those from Scotland’s Premiership will have to start qualifying for continental competition at Easter. The landscape is grim, and typically lost in tribal obsession.Celtic have specific issues. Supporter discontent with the running of the club was made plain by an efficient leaflet campaign outside Celtic Park urging fans not to spend any money beyond match tickets. The “not another penny” campaign is in place until late January. “For far too long, the Celtic board has pursued a complacent strategy focused on being slightly better than domestic opposition,” read the paperwork. Just when those inside the ground sought to focus on football, Kelechi Iheanacho limped off after only three minutes. An already punchless team were therefore weakened further.View image in fullscreenLiam Scales celebrates after scoring the equaliser for Celtic in the second half.Photograph: Jane Barlow/PAJohnny Kenny, Iheanacho’s replacement, had shown glimpses of promise before the magnificent Tomi Horvat strike which opened the scoring. Having pinched possession, Kenny dragged wide of a post from the angle of the penalty area. Horvat delivered a line in emphatic finishing, slamming the ball into Kasper Schmeichel’s top-right corner from 25 yards. It was a goal of stunning quality, rendered even more special due to Horvat’s limited left-foot backlift.Arne Engels should have equalised but dallied on the ball before his shot was deflected wide. Next came more Celtic disruption. The right-back Alistair Johnston, who was making his return from injury, headed straight down the tunnel after pulling up lame. The hosts were two key performers down inside half an hour.They were almost two goals behind as well. Instead, Otar Kiteishvili’s shot flew behind via the outside of a post. Celtic responded through Engels, who watched a goalbound header kicked off his own line by Emanuel Aiwu. Celtic’s sharpest move of the half came five minutes before the break, Benjamin Nygren heading wide when it seemed easier to score.Reo Hatate shanked a half-volley over the Graz bar within seconds of the restart. Horvat was decidedly more accurate at the other end, his low and wicked free-kick almost catching out Schmeichel at his near post. Nygren’s next opportunity was also a header, with which he again missed the target. He did better with his third, a shot from all of two yards which Matteo Bignetti turned behind. One of those nights? Not so. From the resultant corner, Celtic equalised. Parity was wholly valid on the balance of play.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The individuals involved are not known for attacking intent, which summed up where Celtic are. Engels received a short corner, and his cross was helped on by Colby Donovan towards Liam Scales, who finished with aplomb.Graz were to wobble further. A terrific, inswinging Engels corner found the head of Nygren, who this time made no mistake. Persistence – and set plays – had paid off. The Scottish champions had turned the game upside down in just three minutes.Graz’s task was rendered tougher by the actions of Tochi Chukwuani. The midfielder lunged high into the shin of Callum McGregor, reducing the Austrians to 10 men as an obvious consequence.

The recording is entitled “Day in the life of a pro footballer” but this is not the most enticing start. Will it be the usual run-of-the-mill offering about how a footballer has herbal tea, protein powder and a private chef to produce beans on toast?It will not, it turns out. If the key takeaways are that Haaland has maple syrup in his coffee, stands in front of red light to get vitamin D and is sickeningly talented on the barbecue, there is more besides when theManchester Citystriker invites the camera into his mansion of marble, clean edges and floor-to-ceiling windows. Maybe he is not permanently a footballer eager to mow down defenders on his way to scoring goals.Champions League review: A deluge of goals as youth rules for Barcelona and BayernRead moreA Shaun Wright-Phillips-sized teddy bear stands in the corner of the kitchen, confirmation perhaps that the grizzly Norwegian is actually cuddly, although his young child may have something to do with the stuffed toy. Like any sleep-deprived parent, Haaland starts with a coffee, suggesting it is a “superfood, if done right”. The expensive bit of kit implies he has been on a barista course but a Milanese coffee aficionado is unlikely to have added the maple syrup. Equally, they have not scored 24 goals in 14 games for club and country this season.Fried eggs and freshly delivered bread complete breakfast, all cooked by Haaland. It is refreshing to see his self-sufficiency, alongside his girlfriend, Isabel Haugseng Johansen. “I’ve been living alone since I was 16, so I have to cook,” he says. No ready meals for him.Soon City’s sports therapist Mario Pafundi – “flat arse” to Haaland – arrives. If you think Haaland starts his physical preparation once he reaches the training ground, you are wrong. By 9am Haaland and Pafundi are in the home gym for massage and soft tissue work to keep the striker’s groin flexible. Considering the clearly natural talent Haaland possesses, it is a reminder that little things matter at the top.View image in fullscreenErling Haaland with his red light machine to get vitamin D.Photograph: Tactica SàrlWith sunshine lacking in the Cheshire countryside, Haaland enjoys his spell in front of the gym’s red light machine. What is clearly not in short supply locally is red meat. A drive to nearby Greenoaks Farm allows Haaland to procure enough steaks to feed a team, together with raw milk (yes, seriously) and honey. He also stops to buy jars of bee nectar for the camera crew – a nice touch from the big man.The lean, mean goalscoring machine likes “fatty steaks the most”, which does not sound in keeping with nutritional advice – but just look at him. After a little bit of training in the rain, Haaland has earned his dinner. Grace Dent should possibly take over at this stage, as two tomahawk steaks are laid out, one marinaded, one just seasoned. It’s good news for the cameraman because surely Haaland and Isabel cannot see these off. While the meat marinades, so does Haaland in an ice bath, although that seems unnecessary given he has decided the only logical way of cooking a whole cow is on the barbecue outside.Isabel puts “half a mortgage of olive oil” on the salad, leading to a Mr Bean-esque raised eyebrow from the £500,000-a-week striker, who knows the high price of the precious liquid and must be a first pressing type of guy.The steaks hit the grill and Haaland, like any proud Yorkshireman, announces: “This is going to be absolutely lovely” – reminiscent of Fred Trueman preparing for a cup of tea. Surely Haaland has not spent his free hours down the years focusing on perfectingcuisson. “This is where the details are,” he says as he checks the meat. He creates a crusted and perfectly medium steak, eventually dispensing with cutlery to eat it.If we learn two things, it is that Haaland knows the minutiae are what make him a superhuman footballer and that he is human after all. And aspiring strikers remember: maple syrup in your coffee.Explore more on these topicsErling HaalandManchester CityfeaturesShareReuse this content"

With five remaining Europa League games against tough opposition, progress into the knockout phase looks unlikely and after a sobering debut, the former Sheffield Wednesday manager has to prepare his side to face Kilmarnock at Ibrox on Sunday.Röhl went over to the fans after the game and he said: “At first I apologised for this defeat and this performance. They travel a lot for the team, they are always there. This club has a lot of patient fans and they deserve this and it is also very important to show that I understand them. But I said as well: I will work very hard to improve this group of players to step up and get results.”His first team selection saw him bring in defender Nasser Djiga and the much-maligned 21-year-old striker Youssef Chermiti for Derek Cornelius and Bojan Miovski, who were both on the bench.The sporting director, Kevin Thelwell, had this week defended the signing of unproven Chermiti for a reported fee of £8.5m from Everton. He found little joy with some early touches and missed a first-half sitter but his teammates were no better.The home side looked more fluid and in the 14th minute Eivind Helland headed a corner wide before Jack Butland made a terrific save from Ulrik Mathisen’s point-blank header, after he was set up by Holm.View image in fullscreenDanny Röhl gestures to his Rangers team during the defeat in Bergen.Photograph: Kirk O’Rourke/Rangers FC/ShutterstockButland then parried Bård Finne’s angled drive before Holm fired over the bar but Rangers came back and Thelo Aasgaard miskicked 14 yards from goal after taking a pass from James Tavernier. There was more profligacy when Chermiti meekly headed a curling Nicolas Raskin cross into the hands of Mathias Dyngeland.The Norwegian side had regained control when Finne raced into the box with Tavernier nowhere to be seen but, although he took a poor touch as John Souttar challenged, the ball moved past Butland with Kornvig first there to knock it into the net.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It was also a disappointing night for Jadon Sancho, who failed to make a telling impact on the second start since his loan move from Manchester United and was withdrawn in the second half.Villa, who face an in-form Manchester City on Sunday, should still have enough to make it through the league phase of the competition, though their next match is against Maccabi Tel-Aviv in what has become ahugely politicised fixture.Go Ahead Eagles are a provincial club based 60 miles east of Amsterdam and were playing in the Dutch second tier as recently as 2021. The atmosphere in the 10,000-capacity De Adelaarshorst was raucous at the start of the match but Villa needed only minutes to quieten them down.Buendía fed Sancho down the left and his cross was clawed away by the home goalkeeper Jari De Busser, but only into the path of Guessand, who slotted into an empty net. It was his first goal in a Villa shirt following his £25m summer move from Nice.View image in fullscreenMats Deijl turns in Go Ahead Eagles’ winning goal from close range.Photograph: Hollandse Hoogte/ShutterstockVilla could have been out of sight with only 10 minutes on the clock but Ollie Watkins spurned a glorious chance after shooting straight at De Busser, who also saved Sancho’s shot following a jinking run into the penalty area.The visitors should definitely have been further ahead just before the half hour when Buendía played Guessand through on goal but the French forward dallied and saw De Busser block his effort.Emery’s side were in total control but were pegged back out of the blue before half-time. The Villa defence were unable to deal with a floated free-kick and the ball fell to Suray, whose shot took a huge deflection and looped into the top corner.The turnaround was complete 15 minutes into the second half as Deijl controlled Joris Kramer’s cross with his chest and the captain poked the ball past Emiliano Martínez.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They were handed the perfect chance to level in the 77th minute when Dean James handled in the area. However, with the wind and rain swirling, Buendía skied his penalty. Rogers curled a shot inches wide but a late rally was never on the cards and there was a post-match firework display as Go Ahead Eagles celebrated a memorable win.Buendía’s was Villa’s sixth missed penalty in the last 12 months, with Ollie Watkins missing against Bologna this season, while they also lost a penalty shootout to Brentford in the Carabao Cup last month. Emery said: “Today the responsibility was for Emiliano Buendia. And normally he has good numbers shooting penalties, but he missed. Of course, something can happen, and we will try to get more clinical in the penalty shoot than the last penalties we have had.“Our takers are clear. Buendia was today, Sancho, John McGinn, Morgan as well can shoot penalties. And, of course, Emiliano can repeat, but the idea is try to be so, so responsible about the decision and about the takers who can score.”Go Ahead Eagles had qualified by winning the Dutch Cup last season and this was another huge result. Deijl explained the historic nature of the win. “I think the last few years we’ve had a lot of big wins, the big one was, of course, the cup final,” the match-winner said. “I think everyone expected us to have a really hard time in Europe, and I don’t think anyone expected from us to do it like this. So we’re very happy. And of course, this might be the biggest win so far for this club here.”Explore more on these topicsEuropa LeagueAston VillaGo Ahead Eaglesmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Players went to airports, but were told not to board flights and many are said to have felt retraumatised by the experience.Afghanistan had been due to play in the UAE against the hosts, Chad and Libya in theFifa Unites: Women’s Series, with games running from Thursday to Wednesday. The 23 players selected via talent identification camps for the team, Afghan Women United, were due to fly to Dubai on 11 October for a training camp.‘I was lost but football gave me strength’: Afghan women refugees on their fight for recognitionRead moreThe players, located in Australia, the UK, Portugal and Italy, were advised byFifato go to their airports despite their visas not having been obtained. They were then told by world football’s governing body they could not board flights.Players, many of whom fled Afghanistan in extremely dangerously situations via Kabul airport as the final western military flights prepared to leave after the withdrawal of US and other troops in 2021, had been in a state of uncertainty, encouraged to remain ready to travel at a moment’s notice. It is understood Fifa remained in contact with the players during this time.Fifa announced on Monday that it was relocating the competition to Morocco, with the first match – involving Afghanistan – moved to Sunday. Tunisia will take the UAE’s place to complete a four-team lineup. Responsibility for visa applications for travelling teams lies with the host federation and it is understood Fifa sought assurances on visas before it announced on 24 September that the UAE would host the tournament.Many players have felt triggered and retraumatised by the insecurity of the situation and parallels with their evacuation. It is understood they feel mentally and physically drained and are concerned they are expected to play their first match so soon after arriving in Morocco. They flew on Wednesday, with the Australia-based players facing more than 30 hours of travel, and feel let down by the organisation around the team and tournamentFifa said: “We acknowledge that the circumstances, which are due to factors outside of Fifa’s control, may have been difficult and had an impact on some players and staff. As has been the case throughout this project so far, the welfare and wellbeing of all players and staff has, and continues to be, the paramount priority to Fifa.“We are continuing to work on a daily basis, together with the players and staff, to ensure they are fully supported on and off the pitch through tailored safeguarding and wellbeing services that are being offered to the team.”The UAE Football Association did not respond to requests for comment. The UAE has a de facto working relationship with the Taliban government in Afghanistan.Regarding the switch to Morocco, Fifa said: “This change of venue follows last-minute unforeseen challenges experienced that impacted travel arrangements of participating teams. The decision to move the series has been taken to ensure all teams are able to participate in a safe, inclusive and competitive environment, aligned with the values of the tournament and the pioneering and wide-rangingFifa strategy for action for Afghan women’s football.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The West Australian firefighter had just run 764km to win the Backyard Ultra World Championship in Tennessee.Over nearly five days, with little time for sleep let alone his personal hygiene, he proved himself a class above the rest of the field in one of the world’s premier endurance running competitions.At the finish line was his wife Gemma, who met him with tears and a kiss – and told him he stank. “You’re done, that’s it,” she said. “Forever,” Gore replied.‘The most aesthetic line’: how Kilian Jornet climbed the 72 highest US mountains in 31 daysRead moreThe 39-year-old has little more to prove. He had already set a world record in the format earlier this year at the Dead Cow Gully Backyard Masters event outside Nanango, around 200km north-west of Brisbane, where he ran almost 800km.In Tennessee he didn’t have to go quite as far. Just 114 laps, each 6.7km within an hour, until he was the last runner left.“I’m just tired, I just want to sleep,” he said. “There’s been a lot of time throughout this event where I’ve been really confused, like I was out running on the road by myself and I was like ‘how did I get here, what am I doing?’”“It’s definitely been an adventure, and I’m going to be happy to go and get some proper sleep.”Two years ago he ran 670km until he couldn’t complete his 101st lap, and finished sixth.“I was still really proud of my race back then but it obviously didn’t turn out the way that I wanted. To get back here, it’s so much sweeter.”Despite the extraordinary feats of Gore and his rivals, backyard running is very much on sport’s periphery.When Gore’s achievement was posted on the Perth subreddit yesterday, he was recognised not as a world record holder, but as a former manager at Domino’s Pizza in East Fremantle.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

No longer.”Gore looked dazed but happy on the event’s livestream at the end of the race, and said he just wanted to have a sleep and a shower.“I might retire from backyards now and go and do something else,” he said.Explore more on these topicsSportUltrarunningnewsShareReuse this content"

They get the win, and it never really felt as close as the final margin suggests. At 132 for 4, maybe, when Carey fell, or 187 for 5 when it was Short getting out, those were the points when it might have been close. But Connolly settled things down after the Carey wicket, and Owen counterpunched so effectively after Short was out that he more or less finished the contest then and there. India had a slight chance at the end but not enough runs to play with. Even another 10 runs added to that target could have made that last passage of play much nervier.Connolly on the telly says that he looked calm but was nervous when he came out to bat, but was pretty calm by the end even when Zampa came out to join him. It was his most complete and convincing innings for Australia, given that he’s missed out on batting at all in more than half of his international matches. Zampa is player of the match though for his four wickets. Up the bowlers.India were fairly decent with the bat today, thanks to Rohit and Shreyas with some help from Axar, but still underclubbed on that first innings. They’ve got problems with bowler injuries and fatigue, and not that many options left in the squad. Prasidh Krishna and Kuldeep Yadav will surely come in for Sydney, but India may need a third option. Can they get someone from the T20 squad in?

On a previously dry day, the weather teased and taunted. Rain first intervened at 7.17pm, two minutes after the start of play. After a brief resumption it returned, paused, gave the ground staff a bit of time to mop up, allowed the umpires to schedule a 10pm restart and then fell once again at 9.59pm. Twenty-five balls were bowled.“You don’t want to come all the way over to this part of the world and only play one game,” Harry Brook said. “Very frustrating.”New Zealand v England: final men’s T20 abandoned – as it didn’t happenRead moreFor the record, England won the toss and chose to bowl. Two of the first three deliveries went for four, both hit by Tim Seifert – a tantalising glimpse of the kind of run-scoring a combination of a placid wicket, a wild wind and Eden Park’s diminutive boundaries might have produced.Two of the last three deliveries went for six, Rachin Ravindra and Seifert pulling into the stands. New Zealand stood at 38 for one, off 3.4 overs, when the game officially ended.For all his frustration, Brook at least has three ODIs to come, but three members of this England squad will no longer be involved once the action moves to Mount Maunganui on Sunday. Zak Crawley (no balls faced) will stay in New Zealand to continue his Ashes preparations while Phil Salt (60 balls faced) and Jordan Cox (18) head home.Friday marks the first anniversary of Cox being ruled out of England’s Test series here with a broken thumb sustained in training. He must be wishing his luck in this country would be as unpredictable as the weather.This was the first time an international had been attempted in Auckland in October and neatly illustrated why. “I guess this time of year rain is always a potential,” said Mitchell Santner, the New Zealand captain. “It’s always nice to play England no matter what time of year you play.” The issue being that they spent most of the time they were supposed to be playing England not playing England.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

On Tuesday night, Spanish television broadcast reaction to the news from the Estadio de la Ceràmica, live and unfiltered.Cameras caught someone else who felt dismissed and disrespected, treated as if they didn’t count. This time it was someone who was supposed to be on the league’s side, but now appeared as a portrait of poor planning and poorer communication, a lack of consideration that pushed the project to collapse.Plans for Milan’s Serie A match in Perth thrown into doubtRead moreThe man in shot was Fernando Roig Negueroles, the chief executive of Villarreal, due to be the “home” team at the Hard Rock Stadium on 20 December. Sitting in the stands, a cigarette in his mouth, he stared at his phone where the statement had just dropped. It was official, public now:La Liga would not be going to Miami.Roig got up, paced about, threw looks of disbelief at some of those around him and accusing glances at the screen. For a moment it appeared he might throw his phone; instead he spoke into it angrily. All dramatic shrugs, he gesticulated as he left a voice message, then hung up with a furious thud of his thumb.Villarreal already knew the game was off, but not that everyone else would yet, and that included their players and coaching staff. The league had known for at least five hours, the promoters, Relevent, telling the league it was cancelling because it had not been given the guarantees it would go ahead.Barcelona, playing at 6.45pm,had finished against Olympiakos when the statement arrived. Villarreal, playing at 9pm, had found out 15 minutes before kick-off, but had asked for it not be announced yet. And here it was, made official in the middle oftheir game against Manchester City.“It’s an absolute lack of respect,” said their coach, Marcelino García Toral, said. On Wednesday, the club expressed its “deep discontent with La Liga for the poor management of the organisation of the match.” Roig said: “We have been worn down … for nothing.” La Liga had made an enemy of its most loyal ally.View image in fullscreenJavier Tebas, the president of La Liga, said he was grateful for Villarreal’s collaboration and commitment.Photograph: Arnold Jerocki/Getty ImagesJavier Tebas, the president of the league, said he was grateful for Villarreal’s collaboration and commitment: they, andBarcelona, had done this without thinking about themselves, but about the league, the development of Spanish football.They had become defenders of the project, which wasn’t without its problems or, at times, a loss of face that was even more significant now. Not least when Roig Negueroles said Villarreal were not making money from the game, even while Joan Laporta kept insisting Barcelona were, saying last Sunday that the income from Miami would make up for twice having to play at the 6,000-seat Johan Cruyff stadium.Unlike Barcelona, Villarreal had given up a home game. Unlike 18 other teams, they were going to have to cross the Atlantic. Like all 20 of them, they had watched theirplayers take part in protestsover how it had all been managed. They had seen one supporters’ group protest, too, and had to intervene to convince the association of supporters’ clubs to back it. They had promised fans they could go for free or get sizeable discounts on season tickets.Although to their relief they didn’t get 25,000 fans signing up, they did get almost 4,000. Chartering flights and crew was proving almost impossible – all the more so when, despite asking repeatedly, they never received a guarantee it was on. On Wednesday, Villarreal said they had been contemplating pulling out.Roig Negueroles’s response to that brief rebellion from the supporters’ club, in tone and content, had not helped. With remarkable bluntness he had called it incomprehensible and unacceptable, saying that the supporters’ club contributes €22,000 a year (about £19,100) whereas Villarreal’s soccer schools and US projects generate almost €2m.Thibaut Courtois says La Liga plan for match in Miami ‘distorts the competition’Read moreVillarreal had become the bad guy, and they weren’t even being paid for it, defending a project that didn’t defend them back. They had been ignored, not consulted. The organisers of the game they gave themselves to, their allies, could not give them this one, small thing.No wonder Roig Negueroles was furious. On Wednesday night, Villarreal released an angry statement, saying they wished “to express its deep discontent with LaLiga for the poor management of the organisation of the match that was set to take place in Miami against FC Barcelona on 20 December”.All of which sounds familiar: if the Miami plan collapsed, it was as much about the way La Liga did things as what it did. That way is Tebas’s way.“You can’t do things this way,” said the president of the Spanish state’s sports council (CSD), José Manuel Rodríguez Uribes, on Wednesday.“Apart from a small, formal question, it’s practically done,” Tebas announced at the World Football Summit on 8 October. “We can say that on 20 December an official La Liga game with points at stake will be played in Miami.” But 13 days after it was announced, La Liga had to announce it would not.Taking a game to the US requires authorisation. This time, unlike before, La Liga had the backing of the Spanish federation, the RFEF, no longer run by Luis Rubiales, with whom Tebas was at war. That, in turn, facilitatedpermission from Uefa, which said, through gritted teeth, that it did not like it but could not stop it – at least not until the legal framework was changed in its favour.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The European Commission spoke against it, but Tebas, bullish as ever, said it had nothing to do with them, dismissing them as irrelevant. Concacaf had to be formally consulted, US Soccer as well, but when Tebas announced the game as a reality, they hadn’t been. In that very moment, the small details got bigger.The AFE, Spain’s players’ union, had not been consulted either. As for fans groups, forget it. (It was a pleasant surprise the packages offered to supporters were generous, that that issue had been addressed). Last weekend, at every game in the first division the players refused to play for the first 15 seconds. Not, as is assumed, because they were determined to block the Miami game or even because they were necessarily opposed to it. The Atlético captain, Koke, said on Tuesday, even after he knew it was over, that if there are conversations and the players are convinced of the project they would support it, which made the failure to consult them even more of a mistake.Nobody said it would be easy, but it did not need to be so hard, an unnecessary obstacle in their way. There were no conversations, no negotiations; the questions the AFE asked were not answered; they had been locked out of the whole process; and that their requests to meet were dismissed, at least to start with. Then pressure was brought to bear on players, warned that there could be “unhappy consequences” if they were to go on strike. “All we ask for is transparency,” said the Espanyol captain, Leandro Cabrera.Instead, when the players stood still TV coverage panned away from the pitch and all the way out of the stadium. Commentators had to read out a message for peace, which had never been done before at that exact point. Over the weekend, coverage shifted slightly, the league aware that it had backfired, the attempt to hide it only heightening awareness and indignation, Spanish football’s own Streisand Effect.Censorship and manipulation,Thibaut Courtois called it. “I don’t know why you’re surprised: he’s been like this, doing this kind of thing for a long time. I said after the Club World Cup that I have never seen a president of a league in any sport speak like he does.”View image in fullscreenTV viewers were not shown the protests where players stood still for the first 15 seconds of matches, such as Espanyol’s at Real Oviedo.Photograph: Juan Manuel Serrano Arce/Getty ImagesOpposition became more determined, not against the game, but the way it was being imposed upon them. Coming up on Sunday is the Clásico.“Without footballers, there is no football,” said the head of the AFE, David Aganzo, on Wednesday, satisfied they and he – often seen as weak – had demonstrated their collective strength. Yet there is something deeper, more mechanic. The league may have been able to bypass the players, employees who owe their living to the bosses, their clubs. They may have been able to force them into a corner, and still got what they wanted, but the permissions were not in place.There was also was a familiar foe. Systematically opposed to almost everything La Liga propose, with the president, Florentino Pérez, the target of almost endless attacks from Tebas, Real Madrid challenged this project. They did so alone and on the basis that it affects the integrity of the league: Barcelona lose an away game and gain a “home” game, Hard Rock bound to be full ofblaugranas.Madrid wrote two formal complaints to the CSD demanding the game be cancelled. They applied what Tebas called “political and media pressure”. The CSD, which still had to give the final all-clear, just as Concacaf and US Soccer did, requested more information from the RFEF.All the while time moved on, days passed. With 24 hours to go until tickets went on sale and the guarantees still not in place, Relevent could not wait any longer: the potential legal liability for cancelling 65,000 tickets was too great. And so it was over, again.This is the fourth time La Liga have tried to take a game to the US going back to 2018, butBarcelona-Girona,Villarreal-Atlético, andBarcelona-Atléticowere played in Spain. Villarreal-Barcelona will be too.“We were close this time,” Tebas insisted, vowing: “we will try again”, but close is not good enough, an opportunity lost, and if they are to try again it must be done differently.“In the future, if there is a similar idea, it has to start with the premise that there is dialogue, agreement and total transparency,” Uribes said, the “unlike now” going without saying.Tebas once bet a journalist $10,000 that Barcelona-Girona would be played in Miami, but he lost then and he lost now.Explore more on these topicsLa LigaBarcelonaVillarrealEuropean club footballUS sportsFootball politicsanalysisShareReuse this content"

However, Salt Lake saw its winless playoff streak extended to eight matches (three losses, five draws) after sneaking into the ninth and final West spot via results on the final day of the regular season.Mora hadn’t scored in his last 23 regular-season games, or his previous 12 appearances in all competitions, only to come through with arguably his biggest performance in a Timbers shirt.His first goal came following a sequence that could’ve turned into a red card for Salt Lake.Ultimately, referee Guido Gonzales Jr. showed restraint in allowing RSL’s Noel Caliskan to remain in the game rather than issue the player a second booking in as many minutes for Caliskan’s late tackle of Diego Chara.Mora was first to the ensuing, outswinging free kick from the right side. While Salt Lake goalie Rafael Cabral saved the initial effort, the rebound fell kindly to the striker for a low finish in the 24th minute.Mora’s second goal came from a similar sequence 11 minutes later. This time Kristoffer Velde sent in the inswinging service from the right, but again Mora followed his own rebound of a saved header with a composed finish.Glad answered with his header of Diogo Goncalves’ cross four minutes later to give Salt Lake some momentum heading into half-time.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It’s becoming apparent that we are probably doomed either way.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Employment growth is stuck andwage growthis slowing, especially among low-paying jobs.Loan delinquenciesare rising, driving anincrease in bankruptcies. Consumer confidencehas collapsed. And reckless policymaking is taking its toll. Donald Trump’s trade war is cutting farmers’ access to the Chinese market and manufacturers’ access to Chinese rare-earth magnets. His clampdown on migration is hitting access to labor, from agriculture tohealthcare. The drawn-out government shutdown is starting tosap economic growth.Yet all this has been no match for the AI boom. Amid the mire of dismal statistics, the bacchanal of investment by a narrow clutch of technology firms pursuing the dream of superhuman artificial intelligence is single-handedly sustaining economic growth. It is propping upbusiness investmentand powering a stock market rally that is sustainingconsumer spendingandlifting the spiritsof the 60% of Americans who own stock.‘Every kind of creative discipline is in danger’: Lincoln Lawyer author on the dangers of AIRead moreHow long will it last? Trying to predict economic inflection points and stock market convulsions is pointless. Still, the precarious balance of the American economy offers some pretty good clues about where we are heading: we’re probably toast, however the AI story plays out.What if the AI-driven stock market surge turns out to be a bubble? Investors are clearlynervous. The VIX Index, the financial markets’ “fear gauge” that measures expectations of future stock swings, last week hit its highest since “liberation day” in April, when Trump unleashed a barrage of tariffs which sent markets into a tailspin.The AI promise does not offer to replicate some human tasks. It proposes to replicate humansSuddenly, the entire AI project is clouded in an immediate, tangible fear: what if investors come to realize that the stupendous productivity gains that Silicon Valley assures us will more than justify plowing hundreds of billions of dollars into ever more powerful AI agents won’t, in fact, materialize? Trillions of dollars in stock wealth could go poof in days.Former IMF chief economist Gita Gopinathestimates thatif the market crashes like it did after the dotcom bubble burst at the turn of the century, it would wipe out $20tn in wealth held by American households and $15tn in wealth held by investors in the rest of the world.But consider the opposite scenario. What if the dream doesn’t collapse? AI progress over the coming months looks like it will justify Silicon Valley’s productivity dreams. Evidence of its benefits starts showing up in corporate profits. Investors become comfortable with the lofty valuations ofNvidia, Alphabet and the rest of the so-called “magnificent seven” – the tech giants whose combined valuation now accounts for about a third of the entire S&P 500 index of the US’s largest companies. What kind of world do we get then? What would the grand productivity leap mean for humanity?Stock chart of the tech giants outperforming the S&P 500In econospeak, productivity growth is beneficial by definition. It is what drives rising living standards. The technological progress that drives productivity growth – by allowing us to make new products and services, faster and more cheaply – doesbring about losers. Think about farm workers, who accounted for 40% of jobs at the turn of the 20th century, or administrative assistants rendered pointless by the PC,or horses, bumped from their perch in the economy by the internal combustion engine.But workers as a whole have generally gained from rising wages as they adapted to use new tech. Rising income created demand for new products, which opened new jobs. The market price of an hour of labor – ie workers’ wages – has grown tenfold since Luddites started smashing textile machines in the 19th century, even as employment has grown continuously.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But the AI promise is much more ambitious. It does not offer to replicate some human tasks. It proposes to replicate humans. Indeed, the AI revolutionaries aim to build agents that can do everything that humans do but better. It is not a technology that bumps workers into new tasks. It is designed to perform all the tasks at a higher level than any human worker could.This would create a problem that the labor market used to solve: how will people make a living? Redistribution might take its place. But as Erik Brynjolfsson of Stanford Universityput it, the new arrangement would vastly concentrate wealth and power. Most of us “would depend precariously on the decisions of those in control of the technology”, he argued. Society would risk “being trapped in an equilibrium where those without power have no way to improve their outcomes”.Maybe we should hope the AI revolution unfolding before us turns into a bubble that pops. We will all suffer when it bursts – pushing the world into a recession. But after the project falls apart, perhaps humanity can build something more promising, less dangerous, from the pieces.Brynjolfsson points out that the value gained from automation pales alongside the gains from creating something new. In this vein, he suggests that AI should be aimed at building agents to augment rather than replace labor, to help human workers perform tasks that they currently can’t do. AI is already helpingdesign new proteins. On a more prosaic level, it could help provide nurses the technical expertise that would allow them to perform tasks reserved for doctors.Investment bubbles leave valuable knowledge and infrastructure in their wake. The current information ecosystem was built from the rubble of the dotcom bust. A century and a half before then, investors lost their shirts in the crash that followed massive investments in British railways. The British economy sank into a painful recession. But the bubble left behind miles and miles of valuable railway track.Perhaps an AI crash could lay the groundwork to steer the technology away from Silicon Valley’s quest to build some supersmart, software-driven agent to replace meat-and-bones humans and spread asynthetic version of humanityacross the galaxy. We could focus instead on building something that will help improve the lives of humans as they are.Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)NvidiaTeslaMicrosoftStock marketsUS economyEconomicsanalysisShareReuse this content"

Because attacks will get through,” said Anne Keast-Butler, who has headed GCHQ, the British government’s cyber and signals intelligence agency, since 2023.“What happens when that happens to you in a company, have you really tested that?” said Keast-Butler, speaking on Wednesday at a London conference organised by the cybersecurity company Recorded Future. “Your plans … have you got them on paper somewhere in case all your systems really go down? How will you communicate with each other if you’re completely reliant on a system that actually you shut down?”Last week, the National Cyber Security Centre, which is part of GCHQ,announced figures showingthat “highly significant” cyber-attacks have risen by 50% in the past year. Security and intelligence agencies are now dealing with a new attack several times per week, the figures showed.Keast-Butler said the government and business needed to work together to tackle future attacks and improve defensive systems, as modern technology and artificial intelligence make the threats more diffuse and reduce “the entry level capability” that malicious actors need to do damage. She said work with internet service providers to block malicious websites at source was “blocking millions of potential hits” but said major companies needed to do much more to protect themselves.On Tuesday,a report by the Cyber Monitoring Centre (CMC) saidthe hack ofJaguar Land Roverhad cost the UK economy an estimated £1.9bn, which could make it the most costly cyber-attack in British history.JLR had to shut down systems across all its factories and offices after the attack in August, and may not be able to return to normal production capacity until January.Keast-Butler said “[there are] far, far, far more attacks that get stopped than the ones that we’re focusing in on”, but added that the increased publicity around the JLR and several other major cyber-attacks provided a good moment to ram home the importance of cybersecurity protocols.She said she spoke regularly to CEOs of major companies and one of her messages to them was that they need to put people who understand cybersecurity on their boards. “Quite often, the way boards are configured, they don’t have people who will know the right questions to be asking. So the interest is there, but the right questions don’t get asked,” she said.Earlier this year, the Co-op Groupsuffered a cyber-attackthat cost it up to £120m in lost profits and compromised the personal data of some of its members. Shirine Khoury-Haq, the group’s CEO,releasedan open letter in the aftermath detailing the importance of cybersecurity drills to build strategy on how to deal with an attack.“The intensity, urgency and unpredictability of a live attack is unlike anything you can rehearse. That said, those drills are invaluable; they build muscle memory, sharpen instincts, and expose vulnerabilities in your systems,” wrote Khoury-Haq.Keast-Butler encouraged companies to share information on attacks with government agencies, saying that “safe spaces” had been set up to enable them to do so without the risk of giving away commercially sensitive information to competitors.“I think sometimes people are a bit too reticent to come forward because there’s a sort of personal thing on them or their company as a whole. And that doesn’t help any of us, because then they’re not making the kind of long-term strategic systems changes that we can help out with,” she said.Explore more on these topicsCybercrimeGCHQArtificial intelligence (AI)newsShareReuse this content"

The US is regulating AI – just not the way you thinkSacha Alanoca and Maroussia LévesqueBeneath the free-market rhetoric, Washington actually intervenes to control the building blocks of AI systemsThu 23 Oct 2025 10.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 23 Oct 2025 20.35 EDTShareAt first glance, today’s artificial intelligence policy landscape suggests a strategic retreat from regulation. As of late, AI leaders such as the US have doubled down on this messaging. JD Vance champions AI policy with a “deregulatory flavor”. Congressconsidered a 10-year banon state AI legislation. On cue, the Trump administration’s “AI action plan” warns against smothering the technology “in bureaucracy at this early stage”.But the deregulatory narrative is a critical misconception. Though the US federal government takes a hands-off approach to AI applications such as chatbots and image generators, it is heavily involved in the building blocks of AI. For example, both the Trump and the Biden administrations have been hands-on when it comes to AI chips – a crucial component of powerful AI systems. Bidenrestricted chip accessto competing nations such as China as a matter of national security. The Trump administration hassought dealswithcountries such as the UAE.Both administrations have a track record of heavily shaping AI systems in their own way. The US isn’t deregulating AI – it’s regulating where most people aren’t looking. Beneath the free-market rhetoric, Washington actually intervenes to control the building blocks of AI systems.Once the AI bubble pops, we’ll all suffer. Could that be better than letting it grow unabated?Read moreTaking in the full range of AI’s technology stack – the collectionof hardware, datacenters and software operating in the background of applications such as ChatGPT – reveals that countries target different components of AI systems. Early frameworks like the EU’s AI Act focused on highly visible applications – banning high-risk uses in health, employment and law enforcement to prevent societal harms. But countries now target the underlying building blocks of AI. China restricts models to combat deepfakes and inauthentic content. Citing national security risks, the US controls the exports of the most advanced chips and, under Biden, evenmodel weights– the “secret sauce” that turns user queries into results. These AI regulations are hiding in dense administrative language – “Implementation of Additional Export Controls” or “Supercomputer and Semiconductor End Use” bury the ledes. But behind this complex language is a clear trend: regulation is moving from AI applications to its building blocks.The public deserves more transparency about how – and why – governments regulate AIThe first wave of application-focused rules, in jurisdictions such as the EU, prioritized concerns such as discrimination, surveillance, environmental damage. The second wave of rules, by American and Chinese rivals, takes a national security mindset, focusing on maintaining military advantage and making sure malicious actors don’t use AI to gain nuclear weapons or spread fake news. A third wave of AI regulation is emerging as countries address societal and security concerns in tandem.Our researchshows this hybrid approach works better, as it breaks down silos and avoids duplication.Breaking the spell of laissez-faire rhetoric requires a fuller diagnostic.Seen through the lens of the AI stack, US AI policy looks less like abdication and more like a redefinition of where regulation occurs: light touch at the surface, iron grip at the core.No global framework will succeed if the US, home to the world’s largest AI labs, maintains the illusion that it’s staying out of regulation entirely. Its own interventions on AI chips say otherwise. US AI policy isn’t laissez-faire. It’s a strategic choice about where to intervene. Though politically expedient, the deregulation myth is more fiction than fact.The public deserves more transparency about how – and why – governments regulate AI. It’s hard to justify a hands-off stance on societal harms while Washington readily intervenes on chips for national security. Recognizing the full spectrum of regulation, from export controls to trade policy, is the first step toward effective global cooperation. Without that clarity, the conversation on global AI governance will remain hollow.Sacha Alanoca is a doctoral researcher at Stanford University and former John F Kennedy fellow at Harvard University.

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Nothing’s latest semi-transparent noise-cancelling earbuds have a new trick up their sleeves: a high-quality mic in the case that you can push a button to talk into.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.This so-called Super Mic is designed for all those who want a microphone-in-the-hand experience for clearer conversations, recordings and voice notes in noisy environments. For those who talk into the bottom of their phone out in front of them, these are the earbuds for you.But this case upgrade has also upped the price, with the Ear 3 costing £179 (€179/$179/A$299) – £50 more than their predecessors cost at launch. They still undercut top rivals but have edged much closer to the likes of the Google Pixel Buds Pro 2 andApple AirPods Pro 3.View image in fullscreenThe magnets and other details visible through the casing of the earbuds add a little interest to the design.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe Ear 3 still have Nothing’s signature semi-transparent design, with lots of little design elements to set them apart from rather more boring buds, but some of the plastic has been swapped for aluminium for a more shiny look.The shape of the earbuds has been tweaked to be slightly more comfortable over extended listening sessions. They are light, fit securely and create a good seal in my ears. The stalks have squeeze controls for playback, noise cancelling, volume or your voice assistant. They are a little limited but can be customised and work well enough.The buds slot into the square flip-top case for charging, which is pretty compact but quite weighty this year. The battery lasts a solid six hours of playback, with noise cancelling between charges in the case for a total of at least 22 hours. The case charges via USB-C in a little over an hour or about two via Qi wireless charging.View image in fullscreenPress and hold the ‘Talk’ button on the case for the Ear 3’s Super Mic party trick, playing a little tone in the earbuds as the mic activates.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe earbuds have reasonable mics in them, which sound a little robotic at times but do a good job of cutting out background noise. The Super Mic sounds better, with more body and less compression making it great for voice notes, transcription or calls. But the audio quality isn’t quite good enough for use as a lapel mic or similar device for creating recordings.SpecificationsWater resistance:IP54 (splash resistant)Connectivity:Bluetooth5.4 (SBC, AAC, LDAC)Battery life:5.5h with ANC (22h with case)Earbud dimensions:30.5 x 21.5 x 20.8mmEarbud weight:5.2g eachDriver size:12mmCharging case dimensions:56 x 55.5 x 22.3mmCharging case weight:61gCase charging:USB-CGood sound and decent noise cancellingView image in fullscreenThe earbuds come with three sizes of silicone tips for a comfortable fit and good seal.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe earbuds support Bluetooth 5.4 with the standard SBC and AAC audio formats, plus the higher-qualityLDACformat for those Android phones that support it. They can also connect to two devices at once, but doing so caused the Super Mic to be less responsive.Nothing’s previous earbuds have always sounded great for the money, with a good easy-listening sound, plenty of detail and solid separation of tones. The Ear 3 continue the trend but have a bigger sound overall with quite a lot of bass out of the box. It is nice and controlled without overriding the rest of the range, but the excellentNothing X companion appon your phone has plenty of customisation options for those who want something a little more subtle.The noise cancelling does a decent job dampening the general background noise and low rumbles of the commute, and manages the troublesome higher tones such as keyboard taps or chatter better than previous Nothing earbuds. But they can’t muster the same level of noise cancelling of the best earbuds, such as the slightly more expensiveAirPods Pro 3.The transparency mode is also pretty good, sounding quite natural, but neither mode can handle wind noise very well.SustainabilityView image in fullscreenOne of the mics in the case is next to the USB-C charging port, with an LED that lights up in green when the mic is active.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianNothing says the batteries in the earbuds and case will maintain at least 80% of their original capacity for 500 full charge cycles. The earbuds are not repairable but individual out-of-warranty replacements are available through service.The case contains recycled aluminium and tin, but Nothing does not offer trade-in. It estimates the earbuds’ carbon footprint to be 2.87kg.PriceThe Nothing Ear 3 cost£179(€179/$179/A$299).For comparison, the Ear cost£119, theHeadphone 1costs£299, the Google Pixel Buds Pro 2 cost£219, the Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro cost£219and theApple AirPods Pro 3cost£219.VerdictNothing has tried something I’ve never seen before in a set of earbuds, sticking a mic and push-to-talk button into the charging case. It is a novel idea and would be ideal for an interview or videomic replacement. Unfortunately, the mic isn’t quite up to those standards.But for those of us who are not content creators, it works well for calls, recording voice memos or speaking to your phone’s AI assistant, almost like a modern version of a dictaphone for your phone. I just can’t see myself using it very often.The earbuds themselves are another great set from Nothing, which combine good sound, reasonable noise cancelling, solid battery life and a comfortable fit into something much more interesting to look at than your usual boring buds.The price rise into the £180 range pushes them perilously close to some of the very best earbuds in the business, to which they can’t quite hold a candle. And like so many others, the earbuds cannot be repaired,losing them a star.Pros:Super Mic, interesting design, good sound and noise cancelling, comfortable fit, solid controls, Bluetooth 5.4 with multipoint, great cross-platform app, good battery life.Cons:disposable, pricier than predecessors, case quite heavy, Super Mic not quite good enough for a full mic replacement, noise cancelling struggles with louder environments.View image in fullscreenThe Nothing Ear 3 are a good-looking set of earbuds with a party trick or two.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianExplore more on these topicsHeadphonesBluetoothGadgetsreviewsShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.You can bring your entire library on vacation without an extra suitcase. If you’re working through a 1,349-page novel such as Vikram Seth’s A Suitable Boy, your wrists will thank you. And unlike a phone, your e-reader won’t constantly interrupt you with news alerts and texts, so you can lose yourself in a new world or focus on learning something new.While e-readers evolve more slowly than say, phones, the latest batch are lighter, brighter, and more capable than ever. I evaluated six of the most popular models to see which belongs on your nightstand in 2025.Why you should trust meView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Jenny McGrath/The GuardianAs an avid reader all my life, I embraced the convenience of ebooks years ago, starting with an early Kindle model. My local library has a vast catalog, and my virtual queue is always full. Most weeks, I’ll get through a book or two or three. Even when I’m not reading, I’m listening to podcasts to find out whichbookto pick up next.I’m also a veteran tech journalist with more than eight years of experience testing and reviewing products. At various times, my house has been cluttered with dozens ofsmart light bulbs, robot vacuums, and artificial Christmas trees (though usually not all at once).How I testedFor more than a month, I tested sixe-readers, using each for the same amount of time and putting them through the same tests. That included carrying them around in abackpack, knocking them off a nightstand, and even submerging the waterproof devices in water. I also evaluated other factors, such as battery life, charging time and extra features, such as Dropbox integration.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Jenny McGrath/The GuardianTo test content availability exhaustively, I created a list of 26 popular and more obscure books in a variety of genres, including mystery, romance, sci-fi, and young adult. I noted whichbookswere missing, and calculated the total cost to purchase them all. I also timed how long it took to get an ebook from my local library onto the device itself,loaded them up with PDFsand epub files, and connected Bluetooth headphones to listen to audiobooks.Most of all, I read. I paged through fiction and nonfiction, children’s books, a graphic novel, and scientific PDFs on each device. I scored each device based on how easy it was to navigate, the options of changing fonts and layouts, and the brightness and crispness of the display.After my read-a-thon, I returned the e-readers to their manufacturers or donated them to the Seattle public library.All prices current at the time of publication.The best e-readers at a glanceBest overall:Kobo Libra ColourView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of  Rakuten Kobo$229.99 at RakutenBest budget:Amazon Kindle (11th generation)View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of Amazon$109.99 at AmazonBest for kids:Amazon Kindle Colorsoft KidsView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of Amazon$269.99 at AmazonBest for travel:Kobo Clara BWView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of  Rakuten Kobo$139.99 at RakutenBest overall:Kobo Libra ColourA Kobo Libra Colour e-reader on a table and being held by a readerPhotograph: Jenny McGrathIf you’d rather patronize your public library thanAmazon, the Kobo Libra Colour is the e-reader for you. The Libra integrates directly with OverDrive, makers of the Libby app, which makes it the easiest way to download ebooks and audiobooks from your public library.Why we love itThe Kobo Libra Colour is fun to play around with and make your own. It has more fonts and font sizes to choose from than the Kindles I tested, and it’s possible to make subtler adjustments to the brightness and warmness, too.A few other features set it apart from Kindles as well. It has physical buttons for turning pages, or you can tap and swipe on the screen. Dropbox and Google Drive integration make it painless to load your own files onto the e-reader. A stylus, sold separately, lets you highlight and take notes, which was great for PDFs I couldn’t otherwise edit on the device.In addition to its OverDrive access, Kobo has a well-stocked bookstore of its own. There were only two titles on my list that I couldn’t find, and most of its ebook prices matched Amazon’s.It’s a shame that …it costs so much. Its battery drained more quickly than some of the competition, too. If you’re on a budget, the less expensive Kobo Clara Color omits a few features, such as physical buttons and the ability to work with a stylus, for about $70 less.$229.99 at Rakuten$229.99 at AmazonStorage:32GBBattery life:Up to 40 daysDisplay:7in, 300 ppi (black-and-white content), 150 ppi (color content)Waterproof:IPX8 (up to 60 minutes in 6.5ft of fresh water)Best budget:Amazon Kindle (11th generation)Amazon Kindle (11th Ggeneration) e-reader on a table and being held by a readerPhotograph: Jenny McGrathFor a little over $100, the basic Kindle offers almost everything you want in an e-reader. If you just want a portable way to read ebooks and access to Amazon’s seemingly endless supply of titles, this no-frills option fits the bill.Why we love itCompact and lightweight, the Kindle nevertheless delivers plenty of storage for all your ebooks. And you have a lot of reading options through Amazon. I found all 26 titles I was looking for, and my Amazon shopping cart was the cheapest, although Barnes & Noble and Kobo had identical prices on most books.Its 6in screen was one of the smallest I tested, but the text was crisp and easy to read. It had no trouble surviving the drop tests when I knocked it off my nightstand.It’s a shame that …this Kindle lacks the ability to change the color temperature from bluish white to a warmer yellow as bedtime approaches. A dark mode, which makes the background black and words white, might suffice for some. Its battery life isn’t as robust as some of the other options on the list, but it should still last weeks on a single charge.Storage:16GBBattery life:Up to six weeksDisplay:6in, 300 ppiWaterproof:NoBest for kids:Amazon Kindle Colorsoft KidsAmazon Kindle Colorsoft Kids e-reader on a table and being held by a readerPhotograph: Jenny McGrathAmazon makes several kid-geared Kindles. They’re similar to their grown-up counterparts but usually come with a protective case, a longer warranty, and six or 12 months access to an Amazon Kids+ subscription, which includes access to a range of age-appropriate ebooks.Why we love itA color screen makes sense for kids who devour picture books and graphic novels. While hues on books like You Are a Burst of Color are a little muted compared to a physical copy, the 7in screen still captures plenty of vibrant detail.Kindle Colorsoft review: Amazon’s new e-reader gets colour screen upgradeRead moreThe Colorsoft has respectable storage and battery life, and the screen is responsive, making it easy to tap or swipe through pages, even of an unwieldy PDF.

That means your child could use the same device when they start reading grown-up books.It’s a shame that …getting library books on a kid’s Kindle isn’t intuitive.

The Kobo Clara BW can stay powered for weeks and survive an accidental dip.Why we love itWhen I submerged the Kobo in a tub of tap water for 10 minutes, it remained completely functional after I fished it out. Even if you’re not scheduled to lounge on the beach, the e-reader has more than enough space to hold a ton of ebooks and audiobooks. I loaded it up with over 180 PDFs, and it barely made a dent in its storage space.The battery life was impressive, lasting several hours with only 10% power left. It also charged quickly, getting up to 90% after 90 minutes. It outshines the budget Kindle because it can change color temperature, either manually or based on a schedule.While it doesn’t have all the features of the Kobo Libra Colour, it was equally as easy to get books from OverDrive or the Kobo bookstore.It’s a shame that …the screen is a little dimmer compared to some of the larger devices, and it lacks the buttons of the Kobo Libra Colour. Side-by-side with the budget Kindle, it feels a little bulky.$139.99 at Rakuten$139.99 at AmazonKey specs:Storage:16GBBattery life:Up to 53 daysDisplay:6in, 300 ppiWaterproof:IPX8 (up to 60 minutes in 6.5ft of fresh water)The best of the restIf you want a really big screen:Nook GlowLight 4 PlusNook GlowLight 4 Plus on a table and being held by a readerPhotograph: Jenny McGrathWhy we love itBarnes & Noble’s digital bookstore is almost perfect, lacking only a single ebook on my list (and it does have the audiobook version).

Its battery life is the best I tested, too.It didn’t make the final cut because …it’s pretty pricey. Wireless charging is one of the main features, besides its extra storage, that sets it apart from the cheaper Kindle Paperwhite, which is about $40 less.$199.99 at Amazon$199.99 at Best BuyStorage:32GBBattery life:Up to 12 weeksDisplay:7in, 300 ppiWaterproof:IPX8 (up to 60 minutes in 6.5ft of fresh water)What else to know about e-readersView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Jenny McGrath/The GuardianCan I just read on my phone?Yes: Libby, Kindle, Nook and other apps make it easy to get ebooks on your phone. These absolutely work if you don’t want to buy another gadget. However, e-readers use e-ink screens that mimic the look of paper and strain the eyes less than phone screens. Plus, having a dedicated device without notifications can make for a more distraction-free experience.What’s an ePub book?While ebooks come in a few file types, ePubs are among the most common. Kindles use Amazon’s proprietary format, AZW files. Many e-readers also support PDF, DOC, and TXT documents.What’s the best e-reader for library books?Based on my testing, Kobo devices make it the easiest to browse and download public library books for free thanks to integration with OverDrive, which owns the Libby app. You can peruse titles directly on a Kobo, while Kindle readers require you to browse on your phone using the Libby app.Do I need Adobe Digital Editions or Calibri to use an e-reader?It depends on the model. I didn’t need to use Adobe Digital Editions or Calibri to get library books on the Kindles and Kobos I tested. However, I needed both for the Nook. Libby exported its ePubs as ACSM files, which require Adobe Digital Editions. I had to open them in that program to convert them to ePub files I could load into the Nook.From phone chargers to podcasts, the best road trip accessories make the miles fly byRead moreHowever, my Macbook didn’t register when I had my Nook connected. I used a program called Calibri, which converts ebook file formats. The program recognized the Nook, and I could transfer ePub files from my computer with no problem.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Jenny McGrath/The GuardianDo e-readers work with audiobooks?Yes, most of the e-readers I tested can play audiobooks. The catch is that you have to pair Bluetooth headphones or speakers – they don’t have built-in speakers.What’s the best e-reader for highlighting?If you love sharing your favorite quotes on BookTok or want to keep track of scintillating passages for your book club, all the e-readers I tested compiled my highlights and listed them by chapter. I could also make notes tied to specific text. The Kobo Libra Colour works with a stylus, sold separately, that lets you write notes right on the page.How much do ebooks cost?I searched for 26 ebooks across the Amazon, Barnes & Noble and Kobo platforms. They ranged from 99 cents to $29.99. Some were free to read with Kindle Unlimited or Kobo Plus. The average price was about $12. All the popular books I chose were available through my public library, but none of the obscure books I chose were.Can you read Kindle books on Kobo or vice versa?Books purchased from the Kindle, Barnes & Noble and Kobo stores come protected with Digital Rights Management (DRM), which prevents you from sharing them. When I tried to load an Amazon ebook on my Kobo, for example, it showed up as gibberish.

They offer an escape from technology and the endless distraction of mobile phones, despite also being tech devices.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.However, that is starting to change. Colour ebook readers, for graphic novels, magazines and books, are now fairly common, and there are several models designed for note-taking. Plus, a family of these devices use Android, meaning they can run all of those apps that often distract from reading.The core components of almost every e-reader remain the same, though: they use E Ink displays – much more relaxing than a phone or tablet screen, which pelt your eyes with light, and they can last for up to weeks between charges.Are e-readers still needed now that we always have phones in our pockets, often with larger displays? Absolutely. They’re as relevant as they’ve ever been. Contrary to what some may think, there’s more to the world of ebook readers than only Amazon Kindles. Here, we’ll get to the bottom of the strengths and weaknesses of all of the best e-readers, including Kindle rivals from Kobo, Onyx Boox and others.It’s time to pull yourself away from the hellscape of social media – settle down with a calming apocalypse fiction ebook instead.‘They make me want to walk more’: 14 everyday items that could improve your lifeRead moreAt a glanceBest e-reader overall:Kindle Paperwhite£159.99 at AmazonBest colour e-reader:Kobo Libra Colour£209 at CurrysBest affordable e-reader:Kobo Clara BW£129.99 at ArgosBest phone-style e-reader:Onyx Boox Palma 2£249.99 at AmazonBest e-reader for kids:Kindle for Kids£114.99 at ArgosWhy you should trust meI have read books primarily on an e-reader since I bought the first mainstream model launched in the UK, Sony’s PRS-505 from 2007.I’ve reviewed them professionally since 2013, for several websites and magazines. And I’ve had the chance to watch the fall of Sony as the biggest Amazon Kindle rival, followed by the rise of Kobo and Onyx Boox since.I’ve also had a chance to see many years’ worth of trade-show demos of the current top e-reader trend: colour E Ink. My, have colour readers taken a long time to arrive.How I testedView image in fullscreenChoosing the best e-reader comes down to how they feel when they’re being used.Photograph: Andrew Williams/The GuardianThere is no effective benchmark for e-readers. Measuring the brightness of the screens doesn’t tell you much. You can test the power of their computing brains, but that says little about how they feel to use.While I’ve performed those empirical tests on 13 devices for this article, choosing the best e-reader is much more about how they feel to use in everyday life. You don’t truly know one until you’ve been jolted awake after dropping it on your face half a dozen times, having nodded off while reading in bed.Rigorous real-world testing involves multiple sessions of reading in the bath, using them on public transport and reading under library strip lighting to check out screen glare. Just as important, I also used each e-reader’s bookstore. It’s important to question not only how good the book selection is, but also how good its discovery tools are and how easy it is to buy a book, or try samples.I had to look beyond novels and PDFs on some readers, too. Do the colour displays actually make comics, graphic novels and magazines look good, and are the pages easy to navigate? I also made notes on the readers that support note-taking with a stylus to find out how easy that is.Inevitably, a few elements come down to pure preference. For example, whether you prefer turning the page with a button or a touchscreen is simply a matter of taste. But in a category where the experience is everything, this one had to be judged by my real-world use.Here’s my guide to the 10 best e-readers from my testing.The best e-readers in 2025View image in fullscreen‘The best bet for many younger readers’: the Kindle for Kids.Photograph: Andrew Williams/The GuardianBest e-reader overall:Kindle PaperwhiteView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Andrew Williams/The Guardian£159.99 at Amazon£159.99 at John LewisThe Paperwhite was originally released to show off Amazon’s lit E Ink screen tech in 2012. Since then, it has settled in to become Amazon’s easiest-to-recommend e-reader for most people.It’s a mature series that doesn’t suffer the first-generation teething problems that the colour-screenKindle Colorsoftdid, and it costs a whole lot less, too. This is the embodiment of the idea that an e-reader should be a gadget with a single job.Why we love itThis generation of Paperwhite fits a larger 7in screen into a smaller casing than last time around. The display can comfortably cram more words on to each page and contributes to what is a great-looking design.The entirely flat edge-to-edge screen surface eliminates screen shadows. Curved corners make it seem more friendly and the soft-touch back feels great, while the water resistance offers bath-time insurance.A Paperwhite is also a beautiful canvas for novels. Its surface is much purer and cleaner than a spotlight-stealing Kindle Colorsoft, and performance has been massively improved in this generation, speeding up those evenings searching for a new read on the Kindle Store.Is it easy to repair?Amazon doesn’t use glue to hold the Paperwhite together, despite its solid IPX8 water resistance. You can pry the e-reader apart with a plastic pry tool or guitar pick to reveal the battery and a ribbon cable that attaches it to the main board. Amazon doesn’t sell spares for this unit, however, and I was only able to find spares and replacement batteries for the previous Kindle Paperwhite from 2021. So overall, no.It’s a shame that …there’s no Kindle with physical buttons for sale after the Kindle Oasis was discontinued in 2024. It’s not necessarily the Paperwhite’s job to fill that gap, but it is a reason to consider a non-Kindle rival instead. There are also a few features only found in the pricierSignature Edition: wireless charging, automatic screen brightness and larger storage options.Display:7in monochrome E InkStorage size:16/32GBDimensions:127.5 x 176.7 x 7.8mmWeight:211gBest colour e-reader:Kobo Libra ColourView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Andrew Williams/The Guardian£209 at Currys£209.99 at ArgosThe Libra Colour is Kobo’s larger colour-screen e-reader, with a 7in display and an E Ink Kaleido 3 panel.Among the main pluses here is its significantly lower price compared with other colour-screen rivals, the Amazon Kindle Colorsoft and the Onyx Boox Go Color 7.Why we love itComfy page-turn buttons may not be among the Libra Colour’s star features, but they will make some fall in love with this e-reader. It’s not just that page turns now require next to zero movement: the slight curvature of the casing also hugs your thumb for better ergonomics. It’s lovely.Kobo finely balances features and complexity in the Libra Colour. It supports note-taking and integrates with Google Drive and Dropbox, but still retains that all-important simplicity.As one of the first wave of mainstream colour e-readers, it’s also suitable for a wider range of content than traditional devices.You can also borrow graphic novels from the library. But we have a tip if your local library uses theOverdriveplatform: try theLibby appinstead. It’s based on the same underlying tech but makes the process easier. Borrow a graphic novel in the Libby app on your phone, hit the sync button in the Discover tab on your Kobo and the borrowed content will appear in your library. This avoids the need to use Adobe’s finicky Digital Editions software.Is it easy to repair?You can take a Kobo Libra Colour apart without expensive or specialist tools. The back cover is held on with clips, which can be released with a plastic pick. Even better, Kobo has officiallypartnered with iFixitto provideofficial spares, which is great. You can replace the battery, the screen and even the motherboard.It earns theLibra Colour a decent 6/10 repairability score from iFixit. Sounds low? This is fairly high for mainstream consumer tech, and there are compromises. Any significant repairs will spoil the waterproofing, which relies on a plastic coating over the internal components.It’s a shame that …as with all current colour e-readers, the page surface looks much greyer and less clean than on the best monochrome readers. When turning the page on colour content, the onscreen refreshes are slower and more ugly-looking. Adjust your expectations on the punchiness of the colour, too, because E Ink’s colour richness isn’t anything like that of an OLED screen.Display:7in colour E InkStorage:32GBDimensions:144.6 x 161 x 8.3mmWeight:199.5gBest affordable e-reader:Kobo Clara BWView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Andrew Williams/The Guardian£129 at Currys£129.99 at ArgosThe Clara BW is Kobo’s main rival to the standard Kindle. It’s a simple black-and-white e-reader, with a 6in screen and a frame narrow enough to fit in many a coat pocket.It combines a non-flashy, budget-conscious approach to design with an aggressive corralling of features – including some that Amazon holds back for its higher-end Paperwhite model.Why we love itAlthough you can tell from a glance that this e-reader is a more humble model, it’s remarkably feature-rich. The screen light can be much warmer-looking at night-time, to help avoid it affecting your sleep. It’s also IPX8 water resistant, to handle being dunked in 2m-deep water for up to an hour – so it’s bath-time reading approved.Now, I used e-readers in the bath long before they were water-resistant, and I’m not a huge fan of a super-warm-looking reader screen – but the Clara BW will win over even such picky people with its fantastic E Ink Carta 1300 display. The page surface is lighter than on older tech e-readers, providing better contrast. After-image ghosting is reduced and page turns are a little faster too. This all means you get an ultra-clean and clear reproduction of books, mining that ebook reader appeal all the more.While the Clara BW isn’t hugely cheap, it will save you money in the long run: it has OverDrive, a platform used in many UK libraries, built in. You can borrow ebooks for two weeks a piece without spending a penny.Is it easy to repair?Official spare Clara BW Parts areavailable through iFixit, and you don’t need any advanced tools. A light glue is used to keep the screen in place, but this can be loosened with a hairdryer. You may not consider a screen replacement worthwhile, though, since it’s not far off the cost of the entire device.Repairs will also spoil the water resistance, which relies on a main board coating you’ll likely have to pierce. Take care to check your battery too: Kobo upgraded the one in this model in April 2025. Newer models have theP365model number, while older ones areN365.It’s a shame that …Kobo’s take on OverDrive can be a headache, as only books available on the Kobo Store will appear when you search. To see the full library, you may need to use the OverDrive app on your phone.The Clara BW also lacks the note-taking stylus feature of the Libra family.Display:6in monochrome E InkStorage:16GBDimensions:112 x 160 x 9.2mmWeight:174gBest phone-style e-reader:Onyx Boox Palma 2View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Andrew Williams/The Guardian£249.99 at AmazonThe Onyx Palma 2 looks like a phone. It feels like a phone. And it can do almost everything a phone can – but it can’t take calls or send SMS messages because there’s no SIM slot.Still, the style’s ideal if you need to read one-handed – while wedged into a train carriage on the way to work, for example.Why we love itSimultaneously “out there” and obvious, the Palma 2 is an E Ink almost-phone that just lacks the ability to make calls. The Boox book store is onboard, but so is the Android Google Play app store.Any app or game you might use on an Android phone is only a few taps away, making the Palma 2 radically more versatile, and more powerful, than the average e-reader. Constantly need to read work emails and reports while travelling? Just install an email client.There’s even a 16MP camera on the back. While it won’t compete with the camera of a decent phone, it has an optical character recognition feature baked in, so you can digitise any document you take a picture of. It’s the Swiss army knife of e-readers.Is it easy to repair?There are no spares available for this device – even more reason to pick up a case and possibly a screen protector to keep it safe.It’s a shame that …all that versatility robs the Palma 2 of the simplicity so highly valued in an e-reader. To get the ideal experience, you have to switch between four different screen modes, depending on which app you’re using. Is it fast motion you want, or a clearer-looking image? And the recessed screen causes shadows, which become all the more obvious with a screen this small.At times, you wonder why Onyx didn’t go the whole way and just add a SIM slot. It already has a tray for a microSD card, after all.Display:6.13in monochrome E Ink screenStorage:128GBDimensions:159 × 80 × 8mmWeight:170gskip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe FilterFree weekly newsletterGet the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

The base Kindle for Kids seems to be the best bet for many younger readers.The core hardware is the same. For £20 more thanthe adults’ version of this entry-level Kindle, you’ll get a colourful case, an enhanced two-year guarantee and a six-month subscription to Amazon’s Kids+ service. This is a child-friendly books and games subscription that otherwise costs £4.99 a month, or £6.99 for non-Prime members. Altogether, the additions are worth more than the additional £20.Why we love itThe two-year worry-free guarantee may be the most appealing part of the package. The Kindle for Kids tagline is “if it breaks, we will replace it”. And while the small print doesn’t cover all eventualities, we’ve heard almost universally positive reports from customer service claims over the years.While the Kindle itself has the same innards as the non-kids version, the setup is geared towards use by a child. You can choose the child-friendly books from your collection that are then synced on to the device. Thanks to the included Kids+ subscription, there are more books they can download without needing to nag you to buy them.The lock screen adverts seen in other Kindles are left out of kids’ profiles, instead displaying a cartoony image. A handy portal allows parents to see how much of each book their child has read and when. Schedules and screen-time limits can be set, all through a connected phone app.Just as important as all of that, the Kindle for Kids is simply an excellent e-reader. The screen is clear, supported by a bright front light. And while not all that suitable for very young kids, it is easy to use.Is it easy to repair?Amazon doesn’t really want you to repair your Kindle. It doesn’t sell spares. And asiFixitfound when taking apart an earlier Kindle, the front uses double-sided adhesive tape as well as clips – and the battery is glued in place.It’s a shame that …Amazon’s Kindle for Kids guarantee has a fantastic reputation, but the terms and conditions don’t technically cover accidental damage – which is kinda the whole point. This does protect Amazon against abuse of the system, though.It’s also worth bearing in mind that this entry-level Kindle doesn’t have a screen light that can be adjusted to look warmer, and it lacks a waterproofing rating.Display:6in monochrome E InkStorage size:16GBDimensions:158.8 x 114.4 x 13.6mm with caseWeight:256g including cover (157g without)The best of the restView image in fullscreen‘It looks as cute as anything in Amazon’s matcha green finish’: the Kindle (2024).Photograph: Andrew Williams/The GuardianOnyx Boox Go Color 7View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Andrew Williams/The Guardian£249.99 at Amazon£299.99 at ZoroBest for:handling virtually any kind of contentA super-versatile colour e-reader that can do more than most. It has dedicated page-turn buttons and, since it runs Android apps, you can install all sorts of reader apps and bookstores.We found it needed a little too much tweaking to get the most out of it, though. The default power settings lead to infuriating boot-up waits and auto-rotate woes. The front light isn’t the most consistent, either.Still, the sheer breadth of possibilities will put it above the rival Kindle and Kobo models for some. It can even run Netflix and has built-in speakers. Is it ideal for movies, though? Absolutely not.Is it easy to repair?Some unofficial spares are available for Onyx’s older e-readers, but we couldn’t track down any for the Onyx Boox Go Color 7. Onyx offers paid repair services for products within three years of purchase, but your options will be limited after that.It didn’t make the final cut because …it requires interface tweaks that some buyers may not even find, and its front light isn’t as consistent as those of its rivals.Display:7in Kaleido 3 colour E Ink;storage:64GB;dimensions:156 x 137 x 6.4mm;Weight:195gKobo Elipsa 2EView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Andrew Williams/The Guardian£349.99 at Kobo£349.99 at AmazonBest for:note-taking, and for larger-format reads such as graphic novelsThis 10.3in tablet-size e-reader is one of the most affordable routes to a larger note-taking E Ink slate. It lets you write notes directly on to books using the included stylus. Or you can use the Advanced notebook feature to have your scribbles automatically turned into digital type.Its plastic body isn’t quite as slick as the metalKindle Scribe, but it’s almost 50g lighter in return. The Elipsa can also read more formats without needing to convert the files, and the system-level support for integrations with Dropbox, Google Drive and Pocket is ideal.Is it easy to repair?Kobo is now the top name in town for repairability, but the Elipsa 2E was released before this user-friendly push. The company doesn’t offer spares, and a representative from Kobo parent company Rakuten confirmed, “we do not have a reparability program for it at this time”. We couldn’t find any third-party spares online, either.It didn’t make the final cut because …it’s a bit too clunky for some of the situations when an e-reader really shines, like reading in bed.Display:10.3in monochrome E Ink;storage:32GB;dimensions:193 x 227 x 7.5mm;weight:390gKindle (2024)View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Andrew Williams/The Guardian£94.99 at Amazon£94.99 at John LewisBest for:reading on the go, in a coat-pocket-friendly formatThere’s nothing wrong with the bog-standard Kindle. Its display light is actually much brighter than the Kindle Paperwhite’s. Surprising, right? It looks as cute as anything in Amazon’s matcha green finish and is much more coat-pocket-friendly than the pricier Kindles. This will be love at first sight for many.It’s very similar to the 2022 version, though, new colour aside. And for not much more money, Kobo’s Clara BW provides several meaningful extra features. That said, if you already have a healthy to-read pile on Kindle, it’s still a cracking e-reader.Is it easy to repair?Kindles aren’t designed for easy user repair. You can’t buy replacement batteries from Amazon, and we haven’t found a good third-party source for spares either. On Amazon’s portal for out-of-warranty repairs, the official advice for someone whose battery is no longer holding charge is “sorry, devices with this problem are not currently eligible; we are working to increase the problems eligible for repair”.It didn’t make the final cut because …while we love that matcha green, Kobo squeezed in more features at a comparable price.Display:6in monochrome E Ink;storage:16GB;dimensions:157.8 x 108.6 x 8mm;weight:158gTCL 50 ProView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Andrew Williams/The Guardian£265 at Currys£279.99 at ArgosBest for:acting like a phone 95% of the time, because it is oneTCL promises “ebook-like immersion” with this reader-friendly phone. It’s a reasonably priced Android, but it doesn’t have a classic E Ink screen. Instead, it’s LCD with an unusual matt finish. When you flick a switch on the side, it enters a monochrome low-distraction mode, one that’s a dead ringer for an e-reader interface.While a solid phone, you don’t really get the particular eye-balm-like benefits of E Ink tech here: it’s still a backlit phone. A novel concept, but one a little more ordinary than you may assume.Is it easy to repair?The TCL 50 Pro is made to the standards of modern smartphones, and isn’t designed to be user-repairable. TCL doesn’t sell spares to the public for out-of-warranty repairs. Unusually, it provides an excellentmanualfor professional repairers – and the more ambitious hobbyist. We don’t recommend that most people even try, though.It didn’t make the final cut because …it’s too much of a phone and not quite enough of an e-reader.Display:6.8in IPS LCD;storage:512GB;dimensions:167.6 x 75.5 x 8mm;weight:196gKindle ColorsoftView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Andrew Williams/The Guardian£239 at Amazon£240 at CurrysBest for:a simpler take on a colour e-readerThis is what some Kindle fans have wanted for years: an e-reader with a colour screen. In a superficial sense, that’s exactly what this is. The Colorsoft looks just like a Paperwhite, but displays colours (and allows you to make handy colour-coded highlights in documents and books). However, the Paperwhite is still better for plain old “black-and-white” books, so don’t assume the price difference is the only barrier to upgrading.It’s not notably heavier or thicker, and the software at its core is just the same. You have to pay more, of course, and this series gets quite pricey if you upgrade to the £269.99Signature Edition(which comes with wireless charging, double the storage and automatic screen brightness adjustment).Battery life is lower than that of the Paperwhite, at up to eight weeks, but it’s still far lower-maintenance than most of your other gadgets. IPX8 water resistance means it doesn’t need to be coddled too much either.A touch of colour brings the Kindle’s library to life, and the device retains all the classic easy-on-the-eyes character of the Kindle range. However, a Paperwhite will look cleaner and clearer outside on a sunny day, and some will also be disappointed by the limited colour vibrancy.One obvious use for a colour e-reader is comics and graphic novels. However, the Colorsoft’s 7in screen is too small for that; consider upgrading to the soon-to-be-releasedKindle Scribe Colorsoftif that’s what you’re after. Similarly sized rivals from Kobo and Onyx are more ambitious in their features – stylus support and proper note-taking are still the preserve of the Scribe series.Is it easy to repair?The Colorsoft is not designed to be user-repairable. While the rear of the casing isn’t glued in place, the battery is – as revealed by tech-torturing YouTuberJerryRigEverything.Amazon doesn’t sell replacement components or batteries, and we couldn’t find any third-party alternatives at the time of writing. These may appear in the future, but trying to user-repair a glued-in battery? We don’t recommend it. Amazon’s portal suggests an under-warranty repair for Kindles, with no follow-up support.It didn’t make the final cut because …while the Colorsoft is simple and friendly, it’s also rather limited. I wouldn’t recommend it over the Kobo Libra Colour at RRP – but it’s a different story during Amazon’s frequent sales events.Display:7in colour E Ink;storage:16/32GB;dimensions:127.6 x 176.7 x 7.8mm;weight:215gWhat you need to knowView image in fullscreenConsider waiting for the sales if you’re not in a desperate rush to buy an e-reader.Photograph: Andrew Williams/The GuardianHow much should you spend?Good e-readers start at about £100. The cheapest Kindle is just slightly below that; the most affordable Kobo is a little above.If you’re not in a desperate rush to get hold of an e-reader, consider waiting for one of the major sales periods. There are often excellent discounts during Black Friday, Prime Day and other similar discount events.What are the key factors to look for?Every e-reader these days has the one feature that levelled up the category most significantly since its inception: the front light. In the early days, you needed a decent amount of ambient light to use an e-reader; now they’re ideal for reading in the dark.One more recent addition is colour temperature control. Some readers can cut out blue light at night in an attempt to prevent it from disrupting your sleep. However, this does make the light appear orange, and some folks have no problem falling asleep while reading a more “cool” light e-reader anyway. You can trust us on that one.Should you buy a colour e-reader?Colour e-readers are hot stuff at the moment, but they come with compromises.First up, they’re more expensive than the monochrome kind. Their displays appear less clean and pure thanks to the way colour E Ink works, and the display refresh that’s needed on any E Ink device is far more jarring and noticeable.But perhaps the biggest problem with colour E Ink readers is that most of them are relatively small and, therefore, not best-suited to their number-one job – reading graphic novels and comics. The best e-readers for that task come from Amazon and Onyx Boox, which has produced larger tablet-style E Ink devices for a while. However, they’re expensive. The Kindle Scribe Colorsoft starts at an intimidating £569.99, while Onyx Boox charges upwards of €529.99 (about £460) for the latest models in the Tab and Note series. As such, they’re not all that easy to recommend for most people, despite being unusual, versatile and ambitious devices.Andrew Williams is aconsumer journalist who has written about technology since before the first iPhone came out.

Is this game stupid, or am I the stupid one for playing it?Keza MacDonaldThu 23 Oct 2025 04.45 EDTLast modified on Thu 23 Oct 2025 06.03 EDTShareInstead of doing anything normal with my life for the past week, I have been on a horrible hiking holiday with the worst man in the world. In Baby Steps, you play as a useless imbecile called Nate who has done basically nothing with his 35 years on this planet except sit in his parents’ basement and watch anime re-runs. One day he is transported, in his adult onesie, to the foot of a surreal mountain decorated with phallic imagery, and you must get him to the top by controlling his feet individually, lifting them carefully with the controller’s triggers and placing them with the analogue stick.This is ludicrously difficult. Sometimes you’re marching up an easy slope, but you’re often edging over narrow planks, scrambling up dunes with tiny steps, or grasping rocky ledges with his toes. Over and over Nate trips and tumbles, whining piteously as he slides down a muddy slope or bank of sand, his onesie becoming increasingly soiled. Over and over, you get up and try again. Occasionally an Australian guy with crazy eyes or a pantsless donkey man with dangling genitals shows up to gently mock you and offer help that Nate, infuriatingly, refuses to accept.View image in fullscreenEarly on in the game, Nate is offered shoes. Does he take the shoes? Of course not. (To be fair to him, they’re slightly big.)Photograph: Devolver DigitalIf your concentration slips for a second, so will he. Three hours into my time with this ridiculous game, having taken an epic tumble from a plank into a river, I stomped Nate dejectedly around a corner to discover the campsite where I had begun my hike that morning. In the meantime I had achieved nothing besides finding a silly propellor hat, which was itself an extra burden as I had to bend down and pick it up whenever I fell over. Rarely has a game made me want to cry, but when I saw that campsite, I very nearly gave up.Imagine enduring setbacks like this for hours, and then ending up in a warren with a lantern that Nate keeps dropping, leaving you in the pitch dark unless you backtrack to retrieve it. And then, halfway through, there is adownescalator that you must ascend in one try, unless you want to spend long seconds staring at Nate’s upturned rear as he descends slowly to the bottom after a stumble. Andthen, the way out is a spiralling path of sand ledges, on which Nate’s feet keep losing purchase. I was stuck in there for aeons, with nothing but my thoughts, my increasing frustration and Nate for company. Baby Steps reaches impressive new sadistic heights with every succeeding chapter.So why keep playing? Apart from sheer bloody-mindedness that I probably need to unpack with a therapist – I willnotlet this game break me – there are a couple of things going on here. It is exceptionally funny, not just in the obvious slapstick way (it is very, very amusing watching Nate twerk his way down a mudslide) but in its improvised dialogue and absurd delivery. The developers behind this game also voice the characters, and every cutscene you find is a little treat among the travails. An optional challenge in the desert has you trying to get a trophy made of ice up a desert slope before it melts, and as Nate returns repeatedly to the ice-cream cart man with increasing desperation, the developers voicing them also start to lose their grip.And though this might look like a mean-spirited game about laughing at a pathetic man falling over, it turns out to have more to say. As much as I hated Nate at times, to the point where I almost quit playing just so I didn’t have to look at his flailing arse anymore, I also started to feel for him. He is a true one-man taxonomy of loserdom, but he’s alsotrying. Despite extreme social anxiety, masculine insecurity and evident self-hatred, he’s putting one foot in front of the other, in the game’s extremely literal metaphor.If you arrive at the end of a chapter wearing a hat, then you get to play a depressing little 8-bit style minigame about Nate’s former life: his disappointed parents, his overachieving sister, his nonexistent sex life. As the hours passed I got some insight into how Nate ended up in the state he’s in, and though I never related to him directly as some players have, I started to feel almost maternal towards him, unwilling to give up on him despite everything.This game has also brought out my worst self, cursing vehemently at this pallid man whenever one of his useless feet slips from what I thought was a sure hold. But for all the appallingly dispiriting moments, there are also times when you feel like weeping with gratitude after finally persevering enough to get Nate to the next stage of his journey. Baby Steps is silly, but it isn’t stupid. In 30 years of playing games I’ve not played anything like it. It’s made me think and feel surprisingly deeply for a game about falling over.One of my less consequential failuresTo see everything this game has to offer would take a level of masochism to which it is unwise to aspire. After 10 hours or so, I just wanted to get to the end of it. That’s when I came across a massive spiral staircase, extending upwards to the clouds. To the right: a perilous cliffside path that our Australian guide calls the Manbreaker. “You can’t. It’s too hard for you,” he says. “You’re gonna be bashing your head against this thing for the next five years … you’re gonna break down and take these fuckin’ stairs.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toPushing ButtonsFree weekly newsletterKeza MacDonald's weekly look at the world of gamingEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Protests at the ICE detention center in Portland, Oregon, in recent months have reflected the city’s penchant for whimsy and weirdness, and tactics such asnaked bike riding,organized public knittingand “ICE fishing” with doughnuts have largely remained a local affair.But when a federal agent in riot gear ran up behind a protester wearing an inflatable frog costume and sprayed a chemical agent directly into his costume’s air vent with all the casual menace of an exterminator, the inflatable frog went viral. “I’ve definitely had spicier tamales,” the 24-year-old protester, Seth Todd, told theOregonian, cementing the frog’s status as a leftist folk hero.The resistance 2.0 has a new visual language, and this time it’s polyester, battery-powered and full of hot airSoon, activists had launched “Operation Inflation” to equip Portland protesters with an entire menagerie of inflatable animal suits, and the costumes beganappearing at other protest hotspots, including the ICE detention center near Chicago where police have deployed teargas, pepper balls and batons against protesters in recent weeks. By the time millions of Americans took to the streets inlast weekend’s No Kings marches, inflatable costumes were ubiquitous.“I obviously started a movement of people showing up looking ridiculous, which is the exact point,” Toddsaid. “To show how the narrative that is being pushed [that] we are violent extremists is completely ridiculous.”View image in fullscreenSeth Todd, dressed in an inflatable flog costume, watches as Department of Homeland Security officers detain a protester outside an ICE facility  in Portland, Oregon, on 2 October.Photograph: Jenny Kane/APMove over pussy hats. Step aside safety pins. The resistance 2.0 has a new visual language, and this time it’s polyester, battery-powered and full of hot air. The colorful costumes lent a festive air to the No Kings protests and offered an implicit rebuke to the Trump administration’s attempt to smear his political opponents as violent terrorists.“Frivolity and absurdity are kryptonite to authoritarians who project the stern father archetype to their followers,” wrote author Gary Shteyngart in aNew York Times op-edcelebrating the profusion of playful and joyful imagery at Saturday’s marches. “Once the pants are lowered and the undies of the despot are glimpsed, there is no point of return.”It’s a lovely idea, but nine months into the second Trump administration, it’s hard to argue that Americans have yet to catch sight of the president’s dirty laundry. Kryptonite, like the emperor’s new clothes, is just a fairytale. As Americans seek to harness the energy of No Kings and direct it toward building an effective opposition to Trump’s authoritarian agenda, it’s worth considering what the inflatable costumes are actually saying.Street protest movements have many aims and many outcomes, but one of the most important is the production of imagery that conveys a message and outlasts the event itself. Activists are keenly aware of symbolism and optics – they aren’t called “demonstrations” for nothing – and often work to imbue protest aesthetics with their particular ideological and ethical commitments.Nonviolent resistance movements tend to adopt aesthetics that emphasize the inherent dignity and humble humanity of their members. From the Sunday best donned by marchers in the US civil rights movement to the simple dhoti worn by Gandhi and the modest white dress shirt and black slacks of theTiananmen Square Tank Man, aesthetic choices by peaceful protesters are an effective way of manufacturing imagery that, by contrast, illustrates the sadism and brutality of an oppressive state.The rejection of respectability politics by subsequent generations of Black liberation activists in the US – from the Black Panther party to Black Lives Matter – reflected not just an aesthetic but also an ideological shift. The Panthers were not seeking equality within a white supremacist system, but a revolution of the system itself; their signature berets, black leather jackets and firearms asserted their militancy and tied them visually to other leftwing revolutionary movements around the world.View image in fullscreenA protester dressed as a clown passes a riot police squad during a rally against the authorities’ harassment of migrants at the Sonnenblumenhaus in Rostock, Germany, on 4 June 2007.Photograph: Kay Nietfeld/EPARebel clowning or “tactical frivolity” represents a another aesthetic tradition of protest, one that deploys humor and buffoonery to pierce the aura of invincibility relied on by despots and dictators. From Charlie Chaplin’s lampooning of Adolf Hitler in the 1940 film The Great Dictator to theClandestine Insurgent Rebel Clown Army(Circa) protests against globalization and capitalism in the early 2000s, clowning has a storied history within leftwing and antifascist resistance movements.“The clown puts their absurd body in the way of the harm of others. It is politically more expensive to club a clown!” wrote performance artist LM Bogad in a 2020essayabout his experience with Circa. Confrontations between clowns and riot police create what Bogad calls “irresistible images” – “images that are so compelling that our ideological opponents cannot help but reproduce them even though they undermine their worldview and support ours”.What is ridiculously effective in front of an ICE detention center can end up looking just a bit ridiculous when there is no dangerPortland’s inflatable frogs fit squarely into this tradition, co-opting and subverting the aesthetic of intentional cruelty that has been so assiduously cultivated by the second Trump administration. Maga’s exaggeratedly sculpted faces andglorification of human miseryconvey the underlying ethos of the Trumpist worldview: beauty is pain, and pain beauty. When Donald Trump conjures up afalse image of Portlandas “war-ravaged” and “under siege” by antifa “terrorists”, he asks his supporters to embrace the cleansing power of state violence. But when federal agents and riot cops are forced to carry out their attacks on inflatable cartoon characters rather than figures clad in theall-black uniformof recent iterations of antifascist activism, government forces are enlisted in the project of debunking their own lies.But there is a difference between facing down a riot cop outside an ICE detention center, and dancing in the streets during a permitted march on a sunny Saturday morning. When a Vietnam war protester placedflowers down the barrels of rifleswielded by military police at the 1967 march on the Pentagon, or when anti-occupation activistsclucked like chickensbefore IDF soldiers in the West Bank, they clowned in the face of real danger. Without the implicit threat of state violence, without the bravery of offering up a comically unprotected body as a target for real violence, tactical frivolity can devolve into little more than entertainment.View image in fullscreenA anti-Vietnam war protester places single flowers into the gun barrels of military police officers as a gesture of peace in 1967.Photograph: P Conklin/TPX/Rex FeaturesThere are very good reasons to hold family-friendly protests away from the threat of riot cops, but different contexts require different tactics; what is ridiculously effective in front of an ICE detention center can end up looking just a bit ridiculous when there is no danger in the frame.Already, one mainstream media outlet haspublishedan affiliate link-laden article promoting cheap inflatable costumes on Amazon: “You too can join in on the movement today with this steeply discounted inflatable elephant costume that’s less than $20 – a record-low price, according to Amazon.” Similarly, the aesthetics of the flower power movement were adopted and commodified by the fashion industry over and over again, losing political potency along the way. The revolution may well end up being televised, but it is sure as hell not going to arrive in a cardboard box with free shipping from Amazon Prime.When activists turn rifles into vases and riot cops into zookeepers, they are interrupting the cycle of escalating tensionIt is also worth keeping in mind that Trump is not a straightforward “stern father” autocrat. While some of his rhetoric and actions invoke violence and terror against disfavored groups, he has also played the role of his own court jester, to great effect. His disinhibited remarks and frequent buffoonery are doing their own work to disarm and discredit his opponents, who have often struggled to convince the broader public of the seriousness of the threat he poses. So while tactical frivolity certainly has the power to deflate the menace of the Department of Homeland Security’s anti-immigrant security apparatus, it is not clear that it has much to offer when confronting Trump directly. After the No Kings protests, the presidentposted an AI-generated videoof himself dumping shit on protesters; it’s impossible to make him look like more of a clown than he already is.The massive No Kings protests may mark a new American political posture | Moira DoneganRead moreFinally, remember that clowning is a fundamentally de-escalatory tactic. When activists turn rifles into vases and riot cops into zookeepers, they are interrupting the cycle of escalating tension that can turn protests into dangerous confrontations. We absolutely need to de-escalate the violence that is being aimed at immigrants and other disfavored communities by Trump, ICE, DHS and the national guard – but it’s not clear to me that de-escalation is the right tactic for nationwide, popular protests. The Democratic party leadership has overwhelmingly failed to operate as an actual opposition party since Trump’s re-election; they don’t need to calm down, but to wake up.So please, wear your inflatable frog costume if you plan to use your body to obstruct the workings of Trump’s violent deportation machine: in addition to provoking irresistible images, it might helpprotect you against teargasand pepper spray. But let us be strategic about deploying tactical frivolity against Trumpism. When millions of people take to the streets to demand that our leaders and institutions stop capitulating, the message should not be mistaken for anything other than deadly serious.Explore more on these topicsProtest (US)OpinionPortlandOregonWest CoastUS immigrationICE (US Immigration and Customs Enforcement)Trump administrationcommentShareReuse this content"

The US is regulating AI – just not the way you thinkSacha Alanoca and Maroussia LévesqueBeneath the free-market rhetoric, Washington actually intervenes to control the building blocks of AI systemsThu 23 Oct 2025 10.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 23 Oct 2025 20.35 EDTShareAt first glance, today’s artificial intelligence policy landscape suggests a strategic retreat from regulation. As of late, AI leaders such as the US have doubled down on this messaging. JD Vance champions AI policy with a “deregulatory flavor”. Congressconsidered a 10-year banon state AI legislation. On cue, the Trump administration’s “AI action plan” warns against smothering the technology “in bureaucracy at this early stage”.But the deregulatory narrative is a critical misconception. Though the US federal government takes a hands-off approach to AI applications such as chatbots and image generators, it is heavily involved in the building blocks of AI. For example, both the Trump and the Biden administrations have been hands-on when it comes to AI chips – a crucial component of powerful AI systems. Bidenrestricted chip accessto competing nations such as China as a matter of national security. The Trump administration hassought dealswithcountries such as the UAE.Both administrations have a track record of heavily shaping AI systems in their own way. The US isn’t deregulating AI – it’s regulating where most people aren’t looking. Beneath the free-market rhetoric, Washington actually intervenes to control the building blocks of AI systems.Once the AI bubble pops, we’ll all suffer. Could that be better than letting it grow unabated?Read moreTaking in the full range of AI’s technology stack – the collectionof hardware, datacenters and software operating in the background of applications such as ChatGPT – reveals that countries target different components of AI systems. Early frameworks like the EU’s AI Act focused on highly visible applications – banning high-risk uses in health, employment and law enforcement to prevent societal harms. But countries now target the underlying building blocks of AI. China restricts models to combat deepfakes and inauthentic content. Citing national security risks, the US controls the exports of the most advanced chips and, under Biden, evenmodel weights– the “secret sauce” that turns user queries into results. These AI regulations are hiding in dense administrative language – “Implementation of Additional Export Controls” or “Supercomputer and Semiconductor End Use” bury the ledes. But behind this complex language is a clear trend: regulation is moving from AI applications to its building blocks.The public deserves more transparency about how – and why – governments regulate AIThe first wave of application-focused rules, in jurisdictions such as the EU, prioritized concerns such as discrimination, surveillance, environmental damage. The second wave of rules, by American and Chinese rivals, takes a national security mindset, focusing on maintaining military advantage and making sure malicious actors don’t use AI to gain nuclear weapons or spread fake news. A third wave of AI regulation is emerging as countries address societal and security concerns in tandem.Our researchshows this hybrid approach works better, as it breaks down silos and avoids duplication.Breaking the spell of laissez-faire rhetoric requires a fuller diagnostic.Seen through the lens of the AI stack, US AI policy looks less like abdication and more like a redefinition of where regulation occurs: light touch at the surface, iron grip at the core.No global framework will succeed if the US, home to the world’s largest AI labs, maintains the illusion that it’s staying out of regulation entirely. Its own interventions on AI chips say otherwise. US AI policy isn’t laissez-faire. It’s a strategic choice about where to intervene. Though politically expedient, the deregulation myth is more fiction than fact.The public deserves more transparency about how – and why – governments regulate AI. It’s hard to justify a hands-off stance on societal harms while Washington readily intervenes on chips for national security. Recognizing the full spectrum of regulation, from export controls to trade policy, is the first step toward effective global cooperation. Without that clarity, the conversation on global AI governance will remain hollow.Sacha Alanoca is a doctoral researcher at Stanford University and former John F Kennedy fellow at Harvard University.

It’s time for Ukraine’s allies to change their flawed strategyChristopher S ChivvisA negotiated settlement would be unfair and frustrating. But after nearly four years of fighting, it may be the best optionThu 23 Oct 2025 09.30 EDTLast modified on Thu 23 Oct 2025 18.45 EDTShareOn Wednesday, President Trump imposedsubstantial new sanctionson Russia’s giant oil and gas companies, and lifted restrictions on the use of certain long-range missiles by Ukraine, which will now be able to strike more freely into Russia itself. These moves come on the heels of Trump’s conversations last week with Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelenskyy, after which the US president expressed his frustration at both side’s intransigence. Trump had hoped to end this war long ago. Will this be enough?When Russia launched its full-scale invasion ofUkrainein February 2022, the US and its allies chose a strategy that aimed to use Washington’s awesome political, economic and military power to impose such high costs on Russia that the Kremlin would sue for peace on Ukraine’s terms. This “cost-imposition” strategy makes sense in theory. The problem is that, in practice, it has slowed Russia’s progress but not persuaded Putin to end his aggression.Despite multiple rounds of sanctions, more advanced weapons for Ukraine and Ukraine’s own development of more capable weapons such as drones, Russia is still far from capitulation.It now occupies more of Ukrainethan it did three years ago. In February the war will enter its fifth year of fighting – just a few months shy of the length of the first world war.For advocates of the cost-imposition strategy, the answer is clear:more pressure.Specifically, they want an indefinite commitment to more sanctions, more weapons for Ukraine (such as Tomahawk missiles, which the US has so far refused to supply) and the seizure of frozen Russian assets in Europe. Yet more such measures are alone unlikely to provide the shock that would be needed to fundamentally change the trajectory of the war and force the Kremlin to capitulate to Ukraine’s negotiating terms.The oil and gas sanctions just announced increase the pressure, but they come after years and years of sanctions to which Russia has adjusted. The EU is on its 19th package of sanctions on Russia, and the returns are diminishing, with China’s backing for Moscow damping their effect. Few military experts, meanwhile, believe that additional weapons, even the powerful Tomahawk, would have adecisive impacton the war. Back in 2023, Ukraine successfully pleaded for Abrams tanks on the grounds they would turn the tide, but they didnothing of the sort. The long-awaited F-16s were alsonot the magic bulletsome expected – nor was last year’srelaxation of restrictionson Ukraine’s long-range strikes into Russia.There’s also a logical flaw with the “cost-imposition” strategy of how to end the war. On the one hand, proponents of more pressure often claim that serious negotiations now are pointless because Putin is determined to subjugate all of Ukraine. On the other hand, they claim that marginal increases in military or economic pressure will somehow cow him. But if Putin is really hell-bent on dominating all of Ukraine, then why should we expect upping the pressure a little to make a difference?To be sure, the US and its allies have good reasons to impose serious costs on the Kremlin.Russiahas rightly felt the economic and military pain, enough to get the attention of other would-be aggressors worldwide. Without western support, Ukraine would have struggled mightily to prevent Russian forces from entering Kyiv and ousting Zelenskyy. Pressure of this kind is an important ingredient in getting to a ceasefire. But it’s not sufficient in itself.So, don’t expect these additional sanctions to end the war any time soon – unless they are combined with a more open negotiating position from the west. This may mean a deal somewhat more favourable to Russia than the west would prefer. If the war were to end, for example, with Russia occupying the Donbas, it would be an unfair outcome for Ukraine and frustrating for its backers – but still better than many alternatives.Some ostensible supporters of Ukraine may secretly prefer to keep the war going, for example, to ward off the Russian threat by tying it down in Ukraine. But several years with no progress should lead the rest of us to reassess what US power can actually achieve in Ukraine at acceptable costs. Unwillingness to recognise and accept the limits of US power is a refrain that runs through the histories of Washington’s involvement in Vietnam, Iraq and Afghanistan.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Most defenders of “free speech” only seem to care about the freedom to express themselves. They fight for the right to say anything, not whether the speech itself comes from a position of freedom.Focusing on what makes free speech free is fundamental to our moral and political futures. Because free speech, properly conceived, is not just about the right to say what one wants. It is also about being the kind of person who has been so conscientious in their thinking, learning and discussion that they have become a free subject whose speech is directed toward the pursuit of truth. And there are serious threats today against the freedom of thought on which free speech relies.John Stuart Mill makes the connection between free thought and free speech in his classic defense of speech, On Liberty(1859). The first chapter of Mill’s book is not called “Of free speech”, but rather “Of the liberty of thought and discussion”. That’s because speech for Mill is not an end in itself. It is rather one part of a broader freedom to find the truth that begins with a conscientious, trial-and-error attitude in which we are open to criticism and willing to learn from others and through experience. If we are beholden to prejudice, or hatred, or the pursuit of profit, or a desire to manipulate others, then our speech is constrained by these ulterior ends and not free.Trump’s anti-truth crusade is not just an attack on facts – it’s an unravelling of the Enlightenment | Polly ToynbeeRead moreMill in fact criticizes those who “think it enough if a person assents undoubtingly to what they think true, though he has no knowledge whatever of the grounds of the opinion”. For our speech to become free, we have to undertake “due study and preparation”. We have to carefully compare what we believe with experience and reality and consult others with both humility and skepticism. We have to learn the best arguments from different points of view and then come to a considered conclusion.Free speech is both part of this process as we try out ideas and engage with others, and the necessary end of the process when we express our findings. Starting out wrong or misguided is part of how we learn. This imperative to be considerate in how we come to our speech isn’t about putting legal limits on what can be said. Instead, the goal is to change our cultural and political norms to encourage free speech as part of a process of becoming a freer thinker.This process is not easy. There are many factors – both benign and malign – that have incredible power to influence our thinking. Our minds, for example, tend to overemphasize negative and frightful information through what psychologists call “affect heuristics” and “availability heuristics” – shortcuts in our thinking bequeathed by evolution so that we quickly recall information and react immediately to danger.But these same shortcuts can make us susceptible to manipulation – even when we know we’re being manipulated. That’s what makes a false idea like “immigrant crime” so powerful. Even thoughstatisticsshow that migrants commit far less crime than others, these heuristics trick our minds into recalling recent news stories and becoming afraid. So when someone insists on their right to demonize immigrants, that is not free speech – it is fear speech. Again, we neither can nor should make fear speech illegal, but we can create cultural norms that promote genuine free speech.True defenders of free speech are first and foremost defenders of free thought and discussionThis includes an open and engaged public sphere, an educational and scientific research system that expands knowledge, active public venues that encourage people to learn about each other’s points of view, and public labors to produce and circulate factual information and counter propaganda and misinformation.As this list implies, any attempts to undercut science, to spread propaganda, to diminish educational opportunities or to consolidate control over information systems run counter to the freedom of thought. And it is thus not particularly surprising that we are seeing scientific and educational institutions attacked, while a simultaneous curtailment of free thought is being mounted by billionaires attempting to own increasing shares of the media ecosystem – from the ongoing legacy of the Murdoch family, to Elon Musk’s purchase of Twitter, and to the Ellison family’s moves to consolidate media companies and TikTok.While these assaults on institutions are the most wide-scale and pressing dangers to free thought, there are also interpersonal concerns. The truncation of free thought can happen on an individual level when we don’t hear out dissenting views, however distasteful or even dangerous such views may be. Engaging with people we disagree with is fundamental to any robust system of free thinking and discussion.To consider just one example: NPR reporteda storyin 2021 about a woman who turned against vaccines after the birth of her child. She had originally had her newborn vaccinated, and it appeared that her child had an abnormally bad reaction. The doctors didn’t take her concerns seriously, but people online did. She went down a rabbit hole and diminished her freedom of thought in exchange for a community of care.Over time, she broke with the antivax movement because she found a doctor who listened to her concerns and explained the science without accusation. Free thought arises not only through experience and research, but also patience and listening. This is what Loretta J Ross speaks of as creating a “call-in” rather than a “call-out” culture.True defenders of free speech are first and foremost defenders of free thought and discussion. They support not only education and scientific research, but also the kinds of caring engagements with their fellow humans that allow for the accurate transmission of ideas and shared pursuit of truth. To protect free speech, we should embody both these political and interpersonal ideals.Avram Alpert is a lecturer in the Princeton Writing Program.

Something to take your mind off the humdrum details of life. A fresh start. A dream made reality. I recently repainted my french doors from teal to aquamarine. I felt like a new man, albeit one with all the same problems. Just with a new door color.The average homeowner will always find something to change, tweak or revise – even in the most beautiful property. Don’t like your kitchen sink? Rip it out. Not a fan of subway tiles? Scrap them. Have you ever considered the sublime serenity of a rainfall shower on your body in the morning? All of these amenities can be yours for the price of materials, labor and the psychic distress of a bunch of burly middle-aged men traipsing around your house with large, thick boots. A small price to pay for a bit of temporary contentment.The White House demolition, though, is not some minor project. There is probably no more famous house in the world, save for maybe the Playboy Mansion. Significant portions of the East Wing of the White House were ripped out recently, to make way for a ballroom structure. The plan is reportedly todemolish the whole wing by this weekend. The president has claimed he will bepaying for some of it personally. Hopefully he’ll also pay for any cost overruns or delays. As of Wednesday, it had nottechnically even been approved for construction. The Trump administration did say on Tuesday they were going to file plans with the National Capital Planning Commission, but small details like that didn’t stand in the way of getting cracking on the job (officials saythey don’t need a permit for demolition, just for vertical construction). This led to all manner of consternation from observers who feel Trump is overstepping his bounds in permanently altering the historic structure.Big? Beautiful? Donald Trump is literally ripping apart the home of US democracy. Is anyone really surprised? | Emma BrockesRead moreAs a resident of Los Angeles,the capital of wrecking historic structures, I see the appeal of blowing something up because it’s old. What’s worse than something being old? Old things decay and crumble. They cease to be useful. They run the risk of turning into eyesores. Fortunately,our president is none of those things.The nation itself will turn 250 years old next year, though, and it’s surely looking long in the tooth. Our government is paralyzed, our trust in institutions at historic lows. We are like the grandfather who is no longer able to restrain himself from passing gas in public and hasn’t tied his shoes properly in a decade.Maybe the country is in need of a home renovation project, too. As critics of the ballroom project have said, the White House is something of a symbol of the United States – a physical embodiment of both its power and its ideals. The people’s house. Never was that more true than the1829 inauguration of Andrew Jackson(a controversial president whoseportrait Trump restored to the White House), when the seat of American authority wasopen to the new chief executive’s“common-man” supporters. Guests wrecked the place, knocked over expensive furniture and spilled food on the floor. If they were like most houseguests after a raucous party, I doubt many stuck around to wash up.Unlike at that rowdy event in 1829, it seems doubtful that Trump will open up the facility to free public entry. One only needs to look at the way the president treats his resort at Mar-a-Lago, where he has reportedly welcomedguests who pay millions. There’s not much that’s populist about charging top dollar for the privilege of eating steak with a man pushing 80 whose bedtime is probably before the evening news wraps up. Worse yet, like most hosts, Trump apparently loves toplay DJ. How many songs does Lee Greenwood even have in his catalogue?View image in fullscreen‘If the United States is to be refurbished in this century, it’s up to us to decide the aims of that project.’Photograph: Andrew Harnik/Getty ImagesIf the US is to be refurbished in this century, it’s up to us to decide the aims of that project. Is our goal to enrich the few and starve the many? Is it to turn the White House intoBiff Tannen’s Pleasure Palace from Back to the Future II? So far, it seems we’re headed for the latter option – the will of the dollar outpacing the needs of the people. Perhaps that’s always been in the DNA of this place. It certainly was when Jackson swept to power, promising to humble the elites who seemed dead set on extracting as much from the country as possible. Jackson rode to victory on his appeal to the masses, and their desire to bring the people’s house back to the people. I am not the first to compare Jackson to Trump, nor will I be the last. But adding a glorified Club Med to the White House doesn’t exactly seem in line with that promise.The renovation of America should be a collective effort, like when a quarreling married couple has to pick between two different sets of drapes. Instead, it’s a change being shaped by one person whose taste for the dramatic and the gaudy is unmatched. The voice that democracy promises us through voting, the boring minutiae of bureaucracy and rule of law, is muted. If we can’t have a say in how “our” house looks, is it even ours any more?I still believe we have a right to choose our own fate. The so-called “American project” was never truly meant to be finished. We all got used to the White House being the White House – the unchanging icon on postcards and commemorative tea sets. Nothing is meant to last, nor can it. Instead of lamenting the change and being unsettled by it, perhaps we should devote our time and energy to imagining what’s next. As easy as it is to demolish what was, it’s just as possible to build something new. Something better. Something more befitting the nickname “the people’s house”. Let’s start planning our next renovation project. We’ll still have all the same problems, but at least we can go back to dreaming for just a little bit.Maybe a hot tub?Dave Schilling is a Los Angeles-based writer and humoristExplore more on these topicsWashington DCOpinionDonald TrumpTrump administrationcommentShareReuse this content"

Usually I don’t see them because I don’t watch much free-to-air, and because my algorithm knows I don’t live in a reality where things like “home loans” and “mortgage rates” apply to my life.Usually if a bank ad plays in my vicinity, I go into a Charlie Brown-esque fugue state. This ad, however, cleverly caught my eye. It was clever because it featured a dog. Part of my brain is always scanning for animals to look at. It’s like I’m The Terminator, except I’m scanning for metrics of cuteness and probability of pats. In this case, the probability of pats was 0%, because it was on TV, but still I was drawn in.The ad shows a woman with a beautiful kelpie on a lead, walking down the many, many flights of steps of a tall apartment building in the middle of a big city. She takes the dog out to the front of the building to wee on a postage stamp-sized patch of grass. It shows her doing this over and over again on different days, in the rain etc. She’s dedicated! Then one day, she gets a phone call from the bank, telling her she has been approved for a home loan. Now she is in a house, throwing a ball into a back yard for her beloved kelpie to chase!It is meant to be an aspirational ad. But to me, there are two big issues: one, the kelpie should never have been living in an apartment to begin with, and two, her back yard is still tiny!‘Ball junkie’: some dogs show signs of addiction, study findsRead moreIf you know me, you will have been hearing my rant about this topic since before the ad was even a twinkle in the bank’s eye. I recently lived near a small inner-city Sydney park, where people from the surrounding high-rise apartment buildings would bring their working dogs to “exercise”. I would see kelpies and blue heelers and border collies with their yawning owners standing around, casually tossing a ball a few times. These owners either didn’t know or care that bringing your working dog breed down from your small apartment for 20 minutes to chase a ball is nowhere near enough stimulation and exercise for them. They were also unaware that the fat woman nearby was fuming, muttering angrily about them to whoever was next to her.I do have to admit at this point that my issue may stem from a deeper place than pure unselfish dog knowledge. I’m from regional Queensland, and when I was about 12 I got to choose a puppy from a nearby farming family. I went to the pet store to get supplies, including a book telling you exactly how to take care of a border collie. I looked after Jess for three years, she had the run of the place with other working dogs, we were all happy – until my family moved from outside the city into Toowoomba itself.Even though our yard was SIGNIFICANTLY BIGGER than the one in the ad, Jess was desperate to exercise more, kept digging humungous holes and was clearly bored and unhappy. A heartbreaking decision was made, and one of the saddest memories of my life is of hugging her and crying into her fur the day she went to live on a farm (a REAL FARM, not a euphemism). But it was best for her and I knew it. So yes, when I see a bank ad suggesting that a working dog going from a 15th-floor apartment to a 3x3 metre back yard is some kind of huge win, my brain short-circuits.Dogs bred for moving livestock across vast properties are now fetching a ball a few times while their owner plays Candy Crush. The reason you want one of these dogs is because they are beautiful, amazing, intelligent creatures. They are smarter than some of your children. If you are going to get one, you have to put in alotof work to make sure they remain happy and healthy. If you can do that in your apartment or small back yard, that’s great, and impressive. If you are looking for anewpet, and you have an apartment or a house with a small back yard, please consider if you have the commitment and the resources necessary to keep Jess … I mean your dog … happy. There are so many dog breeds more suitable, so many dogs waiting to be adopted. It shouldn’t be aspirational to get a small yard for a kelpie. Congratulations on your house, but maybe try a greyhound instead.Rebecca Shaw is a writer based in SydneyExplore more on these topicsDogsOpinionPetsAnimalscommentShareReuse this content"

What if we could make seabirds resistant to the flu that has beenexterminating them en masse, just by tweaking their DNA a smidgen? Or make fish that can shrug off pollution, or coral that can survive warming waters? Engineer in the sorts of change thatcouldoccur naturally, given enough time, if only the wildlife would stop dying already.Thanks to newly emerging methods, such asCrispr, these feats are within reach. Recently, conservationists met at the International Union for Conservation of Nature’s (IUCN) 2025 World Conservation Congresswhere they debated GM wildlife and voted on a proposed moratorium thatwould stymietheir release into the wild. Ahead of the meeting, a group of more than 90 NGOs issued apress releaseurging the IUCN to “say no to engineered wild species.” But humans have been altering the DNA of other species for millennia.It all began about30,000 years ago, when our species started to domesticate wild animals. When we invited them into our world, slowly but surely, the grey wolf morphed into the dog, the red jungle fowltransformed intothe chicken and the aurochs gave way to domestic cattle.Then, a few hundred years ago, people started to deliberately breed their most desirable animals together. By repeating the process across generations, key features became exaggerated. Cattle became meatier. Pigs became longer. Dogs took on distinctive features which are now identifiable as dachshunds, dalmatians and dobermans. Selective breeding, as it is known, led to the creation ofhairless cats,goldfish with quiffsandgoats that faint when they are surprised. No kidding.Allof these features are underpinned by changes to the animals’ DNA. We may not have modified their genetics by design, but when we select for specific characteristics, the related DNA sequences hitch along for the ride. Over time, this leads to genetic change.It doesn’t stop there, however. As I point out in my book,Life Changing: How Humans are Altering Life on Earth, human activity is nowaltering the DNA ofalllife on Earth. Before our species evolved, life was shaped by natural forces. Evolution and the genetic change that goes with it tended to happen slowly across many millennia.Now, as we warm our world, pollute our planet and destroy the few wild places we have left, we are causingevolution to accelerate. Genetic change is being witnessed on timescales ofdecades and centuries. Central Park’s white-footed mice have acquiredversions of genesthat help them toprocess fatty foodsand afungus found on mouldy nuts. It seems they have evolved the ability to eat pizza and peanuts. Meanwhile, in Nebraska, American cliff swallows have evolvedsmaller wingsto help them dodge traffic, and in Puerto Rico, crested anole lizards have evolvedlonger legs and stickier toesto help them cling to buildings.If altering the DNA of wild species is a line you feel should never be crossed, then I have news for you. That ship sailed long ago. Although the hi-tech methods of today’s scientists may be different, the end result – modified organisms with new characteristics and subtly different DNA – is the same.New technologies often spawn anxiety. When Robert Bakewell, the 18th-century agriculturalist who championed selective breeding, began his work with farm animals, critics said it was unnatural and potentially dangerous. The same concerns were later raised with Patrick Steptoe and Robert Edwards as they pioneered the development of IVF in the 70s. In the 90s, cloning expert Ian Wilmut received similarly short shrift when he unveiled the birth of Dolly the sheep.Then, selective breeding turned out to be useful. IVF led to the creation of happy, healthy babies. And cloning became adopted by the agricultural industry, which uses it to replicate elite breeding animals. Sometimes, methods that are initially perceived as new, artificial and unnerving, become accepted over time as they become familiar and are proven to be safe and helpful. The deliberate genetic modification of wildlife could be one of these methods.Those who raised their concerns at the IUCN conference were right to do so. One way that gene editing differs from traditional breeding methods is that it can be used to introduce entirely novel characteristics. For example, scientists have taken genes from jellyfish and coral and added them to zebrafish, to createfluorescent versions of the popular aquarium pets. Genes from different species can be mixed and matched, so it’s important to decide which changes are acceptable and which are off limits.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A technique calledgene driverewrites the traditional laws of inheritance by ensuring that a particular gene gets passed down to all offspring, rather than the usual half. This can be used to quickly spread helpful features, such as disease resistance, down the generations. But if researchers choose to modify a gene that curtails fertility, the same technique could be used to wipe out an entire species.Yet conservationists aren’t proposing to trick out the genes of wild species on a whim. Instead, they realise that in the midst of this current mass extinction, where150-200 speciesgo extinct every day, traditional conservation tools aren’t enough.So it was a win for conservation when IUCN members in Abu Dhabi chose to reject themoratoriumon releasing GM wild species and instead, accept apolicythat enables researchers to proceed with genetically modifying wildlife cautiously, with key decisions made on a case-by-case basis.Humans are the ones driving biodiversity loss amongallspecies.

This appears to be just another 21st-century development in a major city, a development that a builder has made a tidy profit out of, and flats that will have inevitably been snapped up by landlords and rented out at the highest market rate.But look a little closer, and things are different.There are more children, more families than you would find in a development like this in London. People seem to know one another, neighbours greet each other warmly and are sitting together outside, rather than dashing to the metro station with earbuds jammed in.Inside, some of the flats are arranged in clusters: eight bedrooms opening out into a communal space where neighbours cook, chat and share meals. There are a larger number of working class, poorer and ethnic-minority residents than you might expect to find in a development like this in a major city.This isthe Mehr als Wohnen cooperativein Zurich, Switzerland: a collection of 13 blocks of apartments that represent a different way of developing housing in major cities across the country.The buildings are all owned by a cooperative, which developed them. And the cooperative is owned by the people who live in the flats and have bought a share in the business. The result is no landlord, no speculative property developer, no soaring housing prices, no profit, no need for evictions and a structure that supports genuinely affordable housing and communal living. The cooperative includes shops, workspaces, a restaurant, a children’s nursery and a hotel. It has a no-car policy, supplemented by electric car and ebike rental systems. It could not feel more different from the UK.In many parts of the world, a cooperative such as this is not some kind of utopian dream. Actually, it’s the primary means societies from Scandinavia to South America use to provide housing for people who can’t afford outright market rates. Zurich is fast becoming a modern exemplar of how to use this model to build a different kind of city.One in every five citizensin Zurich now lives in a cooperative – meaning they have bought a share in the company that built and owns their apartment block. This means that despite being a major global financial hub and pleasantly located on the edge of a large lake, poorer, younger people, families and students can still find somewhere they can afford in the centre of the city.The model today involves members buying a returnable share between 7,000 and 25,000 Swiss francs (about £6,500 to £23,500) to join a cooperative and get a home. They then pay a “cost rent” which reflects the cost of repaying debts and maintaining the property.Swiss cooperative housing has a long history. The movement began in the late 19th century, through workers’ movements pooling their wealth to buy houses that could offer them security amid the housing speculation which was starting to take off in urban areas. In Zurich, the city’s first housing cooperative, Waidberg, was founded in 1907, and others soon followed, includingAllgemeine Baugenossenschaft Zürich (ABZ), which was founded in 1916, when 15 members started paying 20 cents each into an account. As soon as enough money had been raised, a new house would be built. ABZ still exists today, owning 5,000 homes which house 12,000 people.The movement grew after the second world war, supported by national and local governments, which offered favourable land leases and loans. The businesses became more sophisticated from the 1990s onwards, clubbing together to raise development finance. A full-scale renaissance of the movement kicked off in Zurich in 2011 after a city-wide referendum set a target that a third of the city’s housing be cooperative-owned by 2050.Since then, cooperatives have had priority access to land that is either leased to them by the city or gifted. They get low-interest loans and favourable treatment in the city’s zonal planning system. They also have access to some globally respected architects, with the developmentsgaining a reputationfor being “examples ofoutstanding architectural and ecological quality”.In some instances, the city also buys up to 20% of the shares in a cooperative, which gives it rights to housing that it then offers to homeless households for lower rents.The cooperatives are allsigned up to a joint charterwhich demands the adoption of principles such as “no speculative profits, good-quality affordable and sustainable housing, integration of disadvantaged households and tenant participation and self-determination”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This can be difficult: managing a building is hard, and the democratic model is a commitment of time that UK citizens would not be used to. But it does mean that decisions about their buildings are taken by them – not imposed by a landlord or freeholder.It is also not always an easy model to make work financially: older buildings will eventually need improvement work, which causes rents to rise. And for newly built projects, rising construction costs have pushed up rents, while a scarcity of land means growth is slowing and demand is outstripping supply.This has led to accusations that they are not affordable, and in fact cater to wealthier renters and drive gentrification. Even with these flaws, the model is cheaper than it would have been if a landlord’s profit margin also needed to be factored in.Could such a model work in the UK? There is no reason to think it wouldn’t. Indeed, there isan existing networkof small, thriving cooperatives here, which trace their history back decades.Part of the reason why it has never become mainstream is that we arguably did something better – council housing – so we didn’t need it to grow. But with social housing provision stalling and housing demand higher than ever, the cooperative model provides a glimpse of an alternative to our broken system. It is one we could at least explore.Peter Apps is a contributing editor atInside Housingand the author ofShow Me the Bodies: How We Let Grenfell HappenExplore more on these topicsEuropeThe housing crisis in EuropeHousingSwitzerlandCommunitiescommentShareReuse this content"

But the really big decisions are not in Labour’s handsLarry ElliottThe UK’s economic policy isn’t decided by politicians, but by the OBR and the Bank of England. This is a system in dire need of a rethinkThu 23 Oct 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 23 Oct 2025 12.23 EDTShareThe budget is still a month away and speculation about its contents is already in full swing. Details of what Rachel Reeves has planned will dribble out over the coming weeks, but two things are certain:taxes are going up, and they are going up by a significant amount.Obviously, the chancellor would prefer not to be in this position. The government has had a rotten year and this is reflected in itsdire opinion poll ratings. The budget is unlikely to make Labour more popular, with a strong risk that tax increases will slow the economy, as they did last year.The importance of budgets is often over-hyped, but this one really matters. If Reeves gets it wrong there will be little hope ofLabourwinning a second term and her days at the Treasury will be numbered. The 2025 budget will count. It could prove to be the single most important event of the current parliament.Left to her own devices, Reeves would not be contemplating potentially highly damaging tax increases when the economy is weak. Likewise, she would be cutting interest rates more quickly than the Bank of England has been doing. But those decisions are not in her hands. While the chancellor can decide on the individual measures in the budget, the overall shape of the package is decided not by the Treasury but by the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR). Since 1997, the government has set an inflation target –currently 2%– and it is the responsibility of the Bank to hit it.In both cases, the idea was that politicians could not really be trusted and it was better to leave the big calls to experts who would not be tempted to make decisions based on electoral considerations. Over the years, the drawbacks of rule by technocrats have become more apparent.Let’s start with the budget. The OBR was set up by George Osborne when he became chancellor in 2010 and it is responsible for independently assessing whether Reeves will meet the rules she has set herself for the management of the public finances. The key benchmark is that day-to-day government spending on items such as teachers’ salaries or NHS drugs should be more than matched by tax revenues by 2029-30. At the time of the 2024 budget, Reeves was expected to meet the target with just a little to spare, but the outlook for the public financeshas deterioratedsince then. The OBR is expected to say that the fiscal rule will be missed by upwards of £20bn in 2029-30.This sounds like a lot, but in the context of anear-£3tn economyit is small change. The OBR struggles to forecast accurately what will happen to the public finances one year ahead, let alone four years ahead. Its assessment of whether the fiscal rule will be met or broken depends on a series of assumptions not just about the underlying performance of the economy but on interest rates, population growth and global energy prices. Even a relatively small improvement to the underlying growth performance of the economy could change the outlook considerably. Put simply, the OBR’s forecasts are just guesswork. Informed guesswork, but still guesswork.The same applies to the Bank and interest rates. Every three months, the Bank produces a report predicting what will happen to inflation in the next three years. Every three months it says – no matter what is happening to the cost of living – that inflation will be back to its 2% target by the end of this period. It seeks to ensure that this will be the case by moving the official cost of borrowing – bank rate – up or down.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Shame Labour doesn’t have the guts to do anything about them | Mathew LawrenceRead moreYet the big moves in inflation in recent decades have been globally rather than domestically driven. There was a long period in the 1990s and early 2000s when globalisation led to much cheaper imports, especially from China. More recently, the main reason inflation shot up above 10% was the sharp increase in gas and food prices caused by the war in Ukraine. Trying to hit a specific inflation target using the blunt instrument of bank rate is a mug’s game. The real issue is whether interest rates are too high or too low given the state of the economy and the likely future path of inflation. With a deflationary budget in prospect, there is a strong case for them being cut, even though inflation is currentlyrunning at 3.8%.In many ways, and for all its faults, the old system by which the chancellor made the big calls was preferable. It recognised that budget and interest rates decisions were linked, it accepted that the Bank of England was a political institution, and it was able to focus on broader measures of economic success and not just on hitting abstract targets.Even if she wanted to make changes, Reeves would feel constrained by the need to keep the financial markets on side. Liz Truss crossed swords with the OBR and the Bank of England, and that didn’t end well. For the chancellor, credibility in the City is paramount.Yet even modest tweaks to the existing status quo – such as broadening the OBR’s remit to assess the likely impact of government policies on poverty, or ditching the Bank’s 2% target in favour of a 1-4% range – would actually make the economy stronger and result in more credible fiscal and monetary policies.

As hard-right figures spread division and laud autocrats, a fail-safe is vitalThu 23 Oct 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 23 Oct 2025 08.03 EDTShareAfter two years in Brazil, I felt I understood its political system better than I understand the UK’s. The reason is a short book in simple language that almost everyone owned: the constitution, published in 1988. Admittedly, I discovered the document’s limitations while trying to explain its principles to a furious captain of the military police with a pump-action shotgun. But at least I knew exactly which of my rights he was infringing.To achieve a similar grasp of rights and powers in the UK, you’d need to be a professor of constitutional law. Theyare containedin avast and contradictorymorass of legal statutes, court precedents, codes of conduct, scholarly opinions, treaties, traditions, gentlemen’s agreements and unwritten rules. They are rendered still less intelligible by arcane parliamentary procedures and language so opaque that we need a translation app.This mess allows great scope for interpretation, whichruthless operatorsreadily exploit. Think of Boris Johnson’s use of Henry VIII powers andhis prorogationof parliament, orTony Blair’s attemptto stop parliament debating his attack on Iraq, by invokingroyal prerogative. These “gentlemen” are no gentlemen. Unwritten rules are for suckers.It’s not that the UK has no constitution. We have one, but its thread is as easy to follow as a fishing line washed ashore after months at sea, bundled and ravelled in weed and tar. In that horrific legal tangle, our citizenship is encoded. If democracy is not clear and intelligible, it’s not democracy.The issue has been pressingsince the Brexit vote.But it becomes still more urgent today, as we may now be threatened with a blatantly authoritarian government. To give one example, Richard Tice, deputy leader of Reform UK, hasexpressed admirationfor the autocratic United Arab Emirates, agreeing with the article his partner Isabel Oakeshottwrote aboutmoving to Dubai in the Telegraph. She lauded the absence of protests, the fact that there is “no safety net” and that people who “can’t look after themselves are simply imprisoned or deported”, and minimised the poor working conditions of migrant labourers (they are getting paid!). She might have added thathomosexuality is illegal, there are no significant environmental protections andmodern-day slaveryis rife. Dubai is aparadise for the richand hell for everyone else. Tice claims that the UK, by contrast,has become “decadent”: a word that should ring any historian’s alarm bells.In a country without a clearly resolved (“codified”) constitution, there is nothingto stop a governmentwith a safe majority from making the UK more like the UAE, or any other dictatorship.As the chaos after the EU referendum reminded us, at nearly all times, parliament is sovereign. The referendum was a rare act of popular sovereignty, whose result sent parliament into aflat spin. What parliamentary sovereignty means is that parliament can do whatever the hell it likes to us, as long as a majority is achieved. There are no effective limits on its actions. In a true democracy, by contrast, thepeople are sovereign, with fundamental rights that cannot be cancelled.The problem is compounded by the fact that we have no codified separation of powers. Through the use of whips and threats, any executive (prime minister, cabinet and advisers) commanding a significant majority of MPs can force parliament to do its will. In other words, parliament has seized the powers that should be vested in the people, and the prime minister has seized the powers that should be vested in parliament. This is what “elective dictatorship” means.We’ve been lucky that no government has yet explored the full scope of such powers. Johnson and Liz Truss were thwarted by their own chaotic failure to prepare, just as Donald Trump was in his first term. His supporters in US junktanks, led by the Heritage Foundation, ensured that no such mistake would be made again. ItsProject 2025probed the weaknesses of the US constitution and discovered that many of its safeguards are illusory when the president has majorities in Congress, and the supreme court seemingly in his back pocket.I would be surprised if the Westminster junktankswere not preparinga Project 2029 for Reform UK, to make full use of our much greater vulnerabilities. Well-funded organisations such as the Atlas Networkexist to reproducesuccessful strategies in one country after another.It is not hard to picture a government in this country using statutory instruments to extend its executive authority, enabling it to impose further statutory instruments, and so on, until the feeble thing we call democracy vanishes altogether. And if we want to protest against such strategies? Sorry, too late. Without constitutional safeguards, Labour and the Conservativeshave already deletedalmost all those rights. Democratic implosion could happen almost overnight.If Keir Starmer had sought to hold the door open for Nigel Farage, he couldn’t have done a better job. He has manufactured disillusionment and alienation on an industrial scale. By adoptingFarage-like positionson asylum and immigration, he legitimises Reform while delegitimising Labour. The very least he now owes us is some protection against the worst that could happen. A constitution, in other words.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But our situation is beginning to look like a political emergency. It’s also an opportunity we may not see again in our lifetimes. Thanks to the absurd results of our first-past-the-post system,Labourhas 62% of seats in the Commons. It could easily muster a two-thirds majority, necessary in most countries for constitutional change.The shift could begin with a citizens’ constitutional convention,like Iceland’sperhaps, and participatory events all over the country. Imagine: a thoughtful, deliberative process that treats us as active and intelligent citizens, rather than political consumers! That alone would be a major break from the way power now operates in this country. This would feed into a parliamentary process huge in ambition and scope, which in itself could revitalise faith in politics. It would help us to decide collectively what we want and who we are. It would leave us with a clear, transparent, intelligible set of rights and powers. Who but a tyrant and his consiglieri would oppose it?Of course, a constitution is no guarantee against autocracy, as the US is discovering. But it makes the would-be despot’s job much harder, and equips us with the tools to push back. Maintaining our tangled, opaque settlement is an elite project. Replacing it with a codified version is democracy’s work.George Monbiot is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsConstitutional reformOpinionLabourKeir StarmerReform UKRichard TiceNigel FaragecommentShareReuse this content"

The cause? A loneliness epidemic that state cash can’t solveAnna GromadaBonuses for families have done nothing to fix a baby bust caused by post-communist Europe’s relationships crisisThu 23 Oct 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 23 Oct 2025 05.13 EDTShareIn 2015, I found myself advising Poland’s president on the nation’s demographic woes: thecountry’s fertility rate had stalled at 1.3 children per woman, among the lowest inEurope. I thought I understood the problem. Most Polish couples wanted to have two kids but settled for one. The culprits, I believed, were predictable: precarious jobs, not enough childcare, apartment prices out of reach. At 27, flush with the confidence that comes from being both right and young, I sparred with politicians and policymakers twice my age, usually men, who insisted that women like me would reproduce if only the state threw enough cash into the cradle.We were all, it turned out, fighting the wrong battle. In the decade since then, unemployment in Poland has sunk to one of the lowest in the EU. Incomes havemore than doubled. Nursery and childcare placesare multiplying. The government now channelsalmost 8%of the national budget into cash transfers known as the“800 Plus” programme, so called because the state pays families 800 zlotys every month, per dependant child.And yet, over the same time period, thepopulation has shrunkby 1.5 million. A million new one-person households have materialised in the demographic ledger, quiet entries in a changing social contract. In 2024, Poland’s fertility ratecollapsed to 1.1– meaning it ranks among the world’s least fertile countries, beside war-scarred Ukraine. This year, it is poised to fall further, to 1.05.The problem is not simply that Poles are having fewer children. Increasingly, they have no partners with whom to try. For the latest phase of gender wars impedes not only childbearing but the very formation of couples – here understood as heterosexual unions – on which birth statistics still mostly rest.For most of human history, being alone meant being dead. The word “loneliness” barely existed in English until the industrial age. At the dawn of the 20th century, only a tinyshareof adults remained unmarried – smaller still in eastern Europe than in the west. In the lands of today’s Poland, scarcely 8% lived as single people; in England, it was nearly double.A century later, the balance has flipped. Nearly half of Poles under 30 are single. Another fifth are in relationships but live apart. This generation, in particular those aged 18 to 24,surveys show, is more likely to feel lonely than any other – more even than Poles over 75. In 2024, almost two in five young mensaid they had nothad sex for at least a year. Abstinence, too, has become partisan: right-leaning men and left-leaning women are the likeliest to be sexually inactive.Young Poles aren’t just sleeping apart –they’re scrolling apart. Seven in 10 have tried the lottery of dating apps.But the promise of infinite possibilityappears to have delivered infinite hesitation: only 9% of young couples haveactually metonline. What appears, in statistics, as a fertility crisis seems, in lived experience,to be a crisis of connection.Gender wars – stoked by political polarisation, the bias of dating algorithms and the clash between autonomy and intimacy – have swept across much of the world. But in post-communist Europe, the conflict feels more acute. Three forces combine to set the region apart: the dizzying speed of change, the rise of psychotherapy as a new cultural grammar and the legacy of communism itself.Few regions have transformed with such vertigo. Since 1990, GDP per capita in Poland has riseneightfold, even adjusting for the cost of living. Since 2002, unemployment hasfallenfrom 20% to 2.8%. Prosperityhas alteredboth daily life and consciousness, upending generational life patterns and sparking a reckoning between the genders.Changing times entail changing mores. They also complicate the intergenerational exchange.My grandma, who left school at 10, urged me to skip going to university at Cambridge lest I lose my sweetheart; my mum, who was one of the first college-educated nurses in our town, rooted for me to go but warned against the UK student loan, insisting that “it’s wrong to live in debt” – as if it were an aberration rather than a cornerstone of the new economic order.Far away in Kraków, at the opposite end ofPoland– and of the social ladder – my partner’s parents, erudite professors, pressed him to polish his master’s thesis rather than risk launching a business that would one day thrive. For many of my friends, adulthood meant not learning from parents but explaining the world to them.The family, once imagined as Poland’s unbreakable core, has begun to fray. When theBerlin Wall fell,less than 6%of children were born out of wedlock – almost five times fewerthan in Britain. But as that generation came of age, many chose distance over duty. Data on estrangement remain imperfect, but by one estimate up to one in four Poles under 45 has no contact with their father; up to one in 13 is cut off from their mother. (In Britain, around one in fivehas no contactwith a family member.) When parents no longer serve as role models, stepping into parenthood yourself becomes an act of improvisation.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Raised on an low-calorie emotional diet, many Poles have turned to psychotherapy. A decade ago, it was taboo. Today, public health providers report a145% surgein psychological consultations in 10 years. Private practitioners, where most patients actually seek help, boast ofgrowth ratesthat would make venture capitalists envious. The shift is cultural as much as clinical: at glossybusiness summits, the keynote is as likely to be Esther Perel as it is a billionaire founder. Parliamentnow debateshow to regulate what critics call the wild west of the psychotherapeutic industry, where virtuosos of soul-searching mingle with pedlars of life hacks.But the22% of Poleswho rushed to couches in the past five years are disproportionately young, female and unmarried. They emerge fluent in the language of “self-care”, “needs” and “boundaries”, directed toward men who often respond in the idiom of “duties”, “norms”, and “expectations”.Behind these intimate dramas lies a paradox peculiar to post-communist Europe: it is at once more and less gender-equal than the west. Communism, in rejecting the bourgeois model of the family, propelled women into full employment and higher education, a policy that left Poland with one of the EU’ssmallest gender-pay gaps. By the 1980s, women alreadyoutnumbered menat universities. Yet in the private sphere – marriage, domestic labour, child-rearing – conservative norms endured. When women still seek partners with equal or higher status, but in a society where they get two out of three university diplomas, the numbers no longer add up.Men and women are literally in different places too: internal migration has shifted the balance so that in the country’s largest cities – such as Warsaw, Łódź and Kraków – there are at least 110 womenfor every 100 men. Men are more likely to stay in smaller towns, away from the new economy and new norms.And so, Poland’s baby deficit is not something that can be remedied with cash bonuses, cheaper mortgages or subsidised creches. What’s faltering in the first place is not the willingness to raise a child but the capacity to build a life with someone.Beneath Poland’s economic boom lurks what could be called the new generation’s Ingmar Bergman moment: a quiet crisis not of war or want, but of silence – of how to live together, how to find each other, how to sustain intimacy in a nation where people have learned all too well how to thrive on their own.Anna Gromada is an assistantprofessorat the Polish Academy of Sciences in Warsaw and a policy adviser to international organisations.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

If their tax returns are to be believed, these companies are making losses. So why do their CEOs deserve a bonus?That’s the obvious question. But there are plenty more to ask – not just about bonuses but about privatisation.Let’s start with bonuses, which are payments made on top of the already huge salaries awarded to CEOs and other senior managers. The idea, supposedly, is that when the company does well, or badly, the managers should share in the gains – or losses. As the Optus and CSL examples show, however, this commonly works only one way. (See also:Qantas, Bupa and G8 Education).It might be thought that the variability of bonuses means that senior managers are being rewarded for taking risk. In reality, however,analysis of CEO paysuggests that the combined value of CEO salaries and bonuses varies by about 15-17% from year to year in normal conditions and 22-35% in volatile conditions. That’s very similar to the 22% variation estimated for average UK households ina 2000 LSE study. Low income and younger households face even more risk. Andeconomic insecurity has increased globallysince this study was undertaken.CSL and Optus pay millions to executives despite paying no company tax in AustraliaRead moreAnd unlike most households, senior managers face no real downside risk beyond the possibility of missing out on a bonus. Even those dismissed for incompetence or misconduct usually receive a hefty payout.Now to privatisation. In the 1990s we were promised the payoff from selling off assetswould be economic dynamism and a “productivity miracle”. But growth in most measures of productivitystalled around the turn of the century, and has stagnated since then. The great majority of our productivity growth since 2000 has been imported, in the form of advances in information technology. And if there is any economic dynamism around, it is far from evident.Both CSL andOptusare products of this era, built on what were once public enterprises. CSL, the former Commonwealth Serum Laboratories, was sold for a song. With the proceeds of this public largesse, CSL embarked on a course of growth by acquisition that has continued to the present day, becoming one of the largest companies in Australia.Optus was artificially created as a competitor for the publicly owned Telecom Australia (later privatised as Telstra), a process that included the acquisition of our satellite service Aussat. Optus remains in public ownership, but the majority owner is now the government of Singapore, which does not feel any obligations to Australian workers and consumers.The rationale for this exercise was the claim that public enterprises were inefficient, cosseted their employees, and gave poor service to the public. All this was to be fixed by introducing competition in consumer markets through deregulation and financial market discipline through privatisation. Thecult of the CEOand the idea that companies hadno obligations except to promote shareholder valuewere a part of this process and contributed to the rise of“bonus culture”.The newly privatised businesses certainly didn’t cosset their rank and file employees.But the number and remuneration of senior managers grew markedly. As for consumer services, it’s striking how regularly the former public enterprises appear in lists of our most hated companies.It is easy to feel helpless about all this. Hardly anyone now believes in the promises of neoliberal reform, including the myth that CEO bonuses lead to better or more efficient companies, and yet they remain a huge driver of inequality.But in various small ways including the gradual reversal of privatisation, and worker resistance to demands for a “return to the office”, the idea that CEOs and financial markets are our natural rulers is being resisted. Sooner or later, we will find our way back into the light.John Quiggin is a professor at the University of Queensland’s school of economicsExplore more on these topicsExecutive payOpinionOptusBusinessQantasPrivatisationcommentShareReuse this content"

Who could possibly replace Claudia and Tess on Strictly?Read moreAnd it cannot be denied – though theBBCwould wish it could – that the appeal of spending 13 Saturday late nights with would-be hoofers in Elstree may have been reduced by almost two years of scandals or allegations about the alleged behaviour, language or favoured stimulants of some participants in the show. These headlines have not affected the presenters, but if you dance with a skunk, it will affect your own scent. At a certain point, agents would worry about contamination by association.The question also arises in any host-show relationship about the balance of dependency and, for Winkleman in particular, there can be no doubt that the show now needs her more than she needs it. She also fronts The Traitors, the BBC’s biggest entertainment hit since Strictly, and with that series likely to expand in its stranger and star versions, she has even more pressure on her calendar.View image in fullscreenTess Daly and Claudia Winkleman on Strictly Come Dancing: 20 Fabulous Years.Photograph: Screen Grab/BBC StudiosOn the second question, however, of who Daly and Winkleman’s successors might be, I would not recommend punting your life’s savings on anyone in particular.Without any insider knowledge on this point, it intrigues me that the BBC’s statement that “plans for the next series will be announced in due course” can be seen as leaving open the possibility that there won’t be a 24th series of Strictly Come Dancing, or at least not next year.There is a parallel here with another BBC One juggernaut. Strictly Come Dancing and Doctor Who have always made interesting schedule fellows because each is a superior reboot of a 20th-century show – Come Dancing (1950-98) and the original Doctor Who (1963-89) – and in their second incarnations they are less than a year apart in age: Strictly launched on 15 May 2004, and the new Who on 26 March 2005. Two decades later, both find themselves in limbo, having lost their main performers and with no details of the next run confirmed after BBC statements that leave existential questions open.The argument that the BBC could not end such recognisable shows assumes that TV hits run for ever. They don’t.Some, like fish or other perishable foodstuffs, suddenly go off. In the late 1990s, Noel’s House Party, which had made Noel Edmonds a BBC One Saturday night ratings topper, suddenly lost half its audience and all of its media interest. In other cases, presenters and network lose their creative energy. Ant & Dec’s Saturday Night Takeaway, ITV’s main weekend entertainment rival to Strictly Come Dancing, was suspended for the foreseeable future earlier this year.If there exists any possibility that Strictly Come Dancing might join Ant & Dec and The Doctor on such hiatus, then Claudia and Tess would be sensible to separate their own departure and tributes to them from any subsequent coverage of the whole show.With ratings above 6 million – lower than before but higher than most other terrestrial programmes in an era defined by streamers – stopping the dancing would be a bold call, but with a sense that some hostile media outlets may be targeting the show week after week for bad news, the BBC may decide that it and the production team need a break.As any 2026 schedule with a Strictly gap or restructuring would surely foreground The Traitors even more, Winkleman is in a winning position. The world of comedy suggests that the breakup of a double-act can disadvantage one former partner more than the other, so transition is important for Daly. It would be a surprise, even professional negligence, if no Winkle-Tess podcast emerges.Explore more on these topicsStrictly Come DancingClaudia WinklemanTelevisionReality TVEntertainment TVBBCfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Photograph: Richard Gray/AlamyTen years on from the release of her rococo masterpiece, Divers, we count down the singer-songwriter-harpist’s most beautiful and devastating tracksByLaura SnapesThu 23 Oct 2025 11.15 EDTLast modified on Thu 23 Oct 2025 17.11 EDTShare20. Divers (2015)“And in an infinite regress / Tell me, why is the pain of birth / Lighter borne than the pain of death?”Joanna Newsomsings on the elegant, kaleidoscopic title track to 2015’s time-obsessed Divers, its nesting cascades of strings and piano echoing the album’s premise, that life contains death, which contains life, and on and on to ∞ …19. Sapokanikan (2015)Joanna Newsom: Sapokanikan – videoThe jaunty piano and sweetly rambling verses of Sapokanikan belie the profound depth of history hidden within Divers’ lead single, which contemplates the passing of time in the palimpsest of landscapes and paintings rich with secrets. The song peaks in a sort of ecstatic existential panic: “Look and despair,” Newsom sings once it settles.18. Peach, Plum, Pear (2004)Since 2006’s Ys, Newsom’s albums have been so conceptually staggering that her simpler debut can seem juvenile by proxy. But it’s still obvious why anyone who heard 2004’s The Milk-Eyed Mender fell in love. Here, as her rattling harpsichord drives an urgent, anxious account of attraction and rejection, the sweetness of her voice and accompanying spurts of a children’s choir make the hurt sting even more.17. You Will Not Take My Heart Alive (2015)View image in fullscreenPerforming in Berlin, 2015.Photograph: Stefan Hoederath/RedfernsNewsom’s narrator manically fights to defy mortality: “Beyond recall, you severed all strings / To everyone, and everything,” she sings amid shards of harp and distorted organ. The beauty of this song lies in the devastating way she repeats the title, crushed as if by the force of protecting her heart.16. Easy (2010)From the monumental triple album Have One on Me, there is slyness in the beauty of Easy, which drains the colour from its beatific scenes of domestic bliss, in bed and fairytale glades, to reveal the strain and indignity of loving someone who resists it. It shifts from gentle piano and strings to something more courtly – maybe the forced ritual of love – as Newsom gradually makes her pained indignation plain.15. Only Skin (2006)The futility of care also drives Only Skin, the 17-minute showstopper of Ys (clock the last letter of Only and the first of Skin), which billows with hope and desperation. Frankly, you could rank the top 20 moments in this song alone: Van Dyke Parks’ grave, pristine string arrangements as Newsom exclaims “being a woman!” at 7:38 pip it for me.14. Sawdust & Diamonds (2006)View image in fullscreenNewsom in 2008.Photograph: Linda Nylind/The GuardianYs’s (comparatively) simplest moment strips back Parks’ arrangements and puts its other collaborator, engineerSteve Albini, in the spotlight, making a virtue of his aptitude for capturing performance: just Newsom, her harp and a heart-stoppingly determined vocal performance that dives into fathomless loss and pain. Her repeated shrieks of “o, desire!” rip the fabric of the universe.13. Does Not Suffice (2010)On the coda to Easy, Newsom packs her silky, cashmere things “and everything that could remind you / Of how easy I was not”, and pictures her cold former lover enjoying his empty palace. With just Newsom and her fingers slipping around the piano, the tone is bittersweet but stunned (and echoes the refrain from In California). It appears to end on a valedictory “la la la” – until the final minute cracks into telling, stormy dissonance.12. Good Intentions Paving Co (2010)Parks didn’t return for Have One on Me, but the rollicking Good Intentions evokes the playful, questing Americana of his debut album, 1967’s Song Cycle. The beauty of Newsom’s lyrics, meanwhile, lies in the contrast between the struggle to make a relationship work and the simplicity of her own desire: “I only want for you to pull over and hold me / Till I can’t remember my own name” is an all-timer.11. In California (2010)Almost every song on Have One on Me is a mini suite unto itself, moving through patches of conversational delivery, ridiculously beautiful melodies and baroque arrangements. Often the best parts are when Newsom’s equanimity boils over and the arrangements become frenzied, fraught: the “cuckoo, cuckoo-koo” cries here are piercingly lonely.10. Cosmia (2006)View image in fullscreenAt the Barbican, London, in 2007.Photograph: Mick Hutson/RedfernsThe incomprehensibility of loss – not being able to prevent it, nor survive it – radiates through Ys’s closing track, a dedication to a friend who died while Newsom was touring her debut. Her harp and Parks’ arrangements swell and search, climaxing in her wrenching attempt to reconcile pain with the soul’s release: “And I miss your precious heart,” she howls, over and over.9. On a Good Day (2010)The shortest song in Newsom’s catalogue may be her most brutal. Widely interpreted as being about a lost pregnancy, as well as the end of a relationship, it features just her and her harp casting holy light on the most terrible of disappointments.8. Time, as a Symptom (2015)View image in fullscreenAt the Vanity Fair Oscar party, 2018.Photograph: Taylor Hill/FilmMagicAs much as loss beats through Newsom’s catalogue, so does her absolute belief in beauty, love, the point of it all. “Stand brave, life-liver / Bleeding out your days / In the river of time,” she instructs in the rapturous ending to Divers (though the album’s final word, “trans-”, links to its first, “sending”, escaping linearity and conclusions in a perfect, unending loop).7. Leaving the City (2015)Newsom may have one of the most finely detailed catalogues in popular music, although her work never feels airless. The incantatory attack of the chorus to Leaving the City is maybe the closest she has sounded to reckless abandon, breaking free from the calculated materialism and glory her lyrics indict.6. Anecdotes (2015)Newsom joins an army of birds (“hotdogging loon!”) in a war against the tyranny of time, craving a “temporal infidelity” and immortality that doesn’t depend on surrendering our “borrowed bones” come life’s end. She’s a stalwart, stirring commander in the first half, before it skews prismatic and awesome, as if high on the possibilities of life beyond earthly constraint.5. Emily (2006)View image in fullscreenNewsom in 2010.Photograph: Sarah Lee/The GuardianOne of the most symphonically beautiful songs in Newsom’s catalogue is a tribute to her astrophysicist sister and her metaphysical and corporeal guidance. In a catalogue that should already have received the Pulitzer prize, describing shallow water as “a mud-cloud, mica-spangled, like the sky’d been breathing on a mirror” is especially wondrous.4. Jackrabbits (2010)From Big Black’s noise to Joanna Newsom’s hush: 10 of Steve Albini’s greatest recordingsRead moreNewsom sings in a crushed murmur on Jackrabbits, as if not wanting to own up to her proposal that, in the wake of grievous loss, she and her estranged lover might give things another go. Hearing this poetic writer sing something as tangibly mundane and despondent as “I was tired of being drunk” hits extra hard.3. Monkey & Bear (2006)A fable about exploitation and the toll of performance, this is the best storytelling in Newsom’s catalogue, with a depth of reference to nature, the cosmos and the gods unmatched by anyone. The menace that comes into her voice as the monkey realises the bear is set to escape is startling, piqued by leaping woodwinds.2. Baby Birch (2010)The simple lilt of harp at the outset of Baby Birch echoes the childlike beauty of Newsom’s debut single, Sprout and the Bean, which only adds to the agony of another song that clearly concerns pregnancy loss. Six minutes in, the weather darkens and the pace quickens, creating an utterly gut-punching sense of futile panic.1. Go Long (2010)Touching on the story of Bluebeard and the chamber of murdered past brides that he reveals to his next victim – “gilded with the gold teeth of the women who loved you” – the exquisite Go Long excoriates the male pride, violence and stubbornness that condemns such figures to loneliness at the expense of those who try to love them. It’s one of Newsom’s finest-spun performances, her harp a reverberant synaptic tingle, her grave delivery flaring with contempt and pity. Of all her admonitions, about war and regal hauteur, the sorriness in her voice as she observes “you are badly hurt, you’re a silly goose” may be the most cutting of all.Joanna Newsom’s catalogue isavailable on BandcampExplore more on these topicsRankedJoanna NewsomIndieExperimental musicVan Dyke ParksSteve AlbinifeaturesShareReuse this content"

It was impactful enough to send their single Tainted Love first into the Top Ten, then to No 1 – it ultimately became the second biggest-selling single of the year – and to provoke a number of complaints. The latter were caused by the duo’s frontman,Marc Almond, clad in eyeliner and jewellery, delivering his vocal with a weird combination of intense passion, high camp and occasional knowing looks to camera: he was clearly a gay man, but a gay man who declined to conform to the pantomime stereotype that still prevailed on British TV, a decision that first upset his own record company boss – who collared Almond backstage and protested “you’ve got to butch it up a bit!” – then apparently caused the BBC’s switchboards to light up.View image in fullscreenMarc Almond and Dave Ball of Soft Cell.Photograph: Peter AshworthAlmond was such an arresting presence that it was easy to overlook the other guy on stage, moustachioed, mute and virtually motionless behind his keyboard. But, as his bandmate was given to pointing out, overlookingDave Ballwas a terrible misjudgement. “He really was a psycho,” Almond later recalled. “There would be times when he’d leap from behind the keyboards if someone was threatening me on stage, and he’d punch someone in the front row.”Moreover, Ball was every bit as integral to Soft Cell’s success as Almond. He had grown up in Blackpool, one of northern soul’s hotspots, and was largely responsible for the music’s presence in Soft Cell’s oeuvre: they covered not just Gloria Jones’s warp-speed stomper Tainted Love, but Judy Street’s What and Franki Valli’s The Night, Northern dancefloor favourites all. It was Ball who’d come up with their version of Tainted Love’s hook, by percussively emphasising the first two notes of the song’s bassline on his synth: doink-doink! It was Ball’s childhood love of John Barry soundtracks that gave Soft Cell’s greatest single – the quite extraordinarily spiteful ballad Say Hello, Wave Goodbye – with its cinematic lushness and Ball’s Korg-bass synth that became the signature of their early sound (you can hear it used to impressively filthy effect on Tainted Love’s follow-up, the Top 5 hit Bedsitter). And if he looked less of an obvious threat to the heteronormative mores of middle England than his bandmate, Ball was equally committed to the idea that Soft Cell should be a pop band that could, in Almond’s words, “provoke people, shock them, wake them up, be subversive”. His own tastes in electronic music ran less to synth-pop than the confrontational racket made by Suicide and Throbbing Gristle.Ball and Almond’s own desire for confrontation made them stand out, even in the anything-goes climate of post-punk pop, as demonstrated by the tabloid furore caused by the video for Sex Dwarf, a track from their debut album Non-Stop Erotic Cabaret, and the fact that their debut album had a track called Sex Dwarf on it in the first place.It made for a succession of startling releases, but after their initial brace of hits, it also proved their commercial downfall: anything-goes climate or not, trailing their second album with two singles that respectively concern themselves with a horribly dysfunctional family (Where the Heart Is) and amphetamine-fuelled compulsive sexual behaviour (the John Rechy-inspired Numbers) proved a little too much for the British record-buying public. By the time of their third album, 1984’s extraordinary This Last Night in Sodom, it was hard to avoid the feeling Ball and Almond were going out of their way to destroy whatever remained of their pop success. Produced by Ball and recorded in mono “just to be bloody-minded”, it sounded claustrophobic, chaotic and viscerally thrilling: on one track, the clanking, improvised, completely atonal Slave to This, Ball really let his love of industrial music run riot. Its lead single Soul Inside was accompanied by a video of the duo smashing up their gold and platinum discs. They broke up shortly after its release.On Ball’s subsequent solo album, In Strict Tempo, he ventured deeper into the musical leftfield: equally influenced by dance, classical and industrial music, it featured vocals by Genesis P-Orridge and Gavin Friday of the Virgin Prunes, while its cover star was Geoff Rushton, better known as John Balance of Coil. But after its release, he worked mainly as a producer and remixer. He kept up his association with Genesis P-Orridge, contributing to Jack the Tab and Tekno Acid Beat, two 1988 Psychic TV projects that billed themselves as acid house albums, despite sounding substantially less like acid house than Soft Cell’s first single Memorabilia which, with its relentless four to the floor kick drum and trebly chattering synth, weirdly presaged the music sweeping Britain during the Second Summer of Love in 1988.In fact, Ball was ahead of the curve when it came to acid house in more ways than one. Introduced to the then-legal drug MDMA in New York during the making of Non-Stop Erotic Cabaret, the duo let it consume their remix album Non Stop Ecstatic Dancing. The clue was in the title, not that anyone in the UK at the time would have known what ecstasy was, or indeed what the rap on a new version of Memorabilia was driving at: “We take a pill and shut our eyes and let our love materialise / I don’t mean love on a chocolate box, I mean a love that really rocks.”In 1989, he formed the Grid with another Psychic TV alumnus, Richard Norris. In a curious echo of Soft Cell’s success with Tainted Love, they scored a huge hit with a track that wasn’t fully representative of what they were about. A commercial house tune driven by a banjo sample and recorded, at least in part, with the intention of irritating dance purists, Swamp Thing was released in 1994 – the same year the duo produced another huge house hit, Billie Ray Martin’s Your Loving Arms – but its perky, radio-friendly tone was some distance from the more esoteric aspects of the Grid’s oeuvre. They had previously collaborated with Timothy Leary and Sun Ra and Roxy Music’s Andy MacKay; the more characteristic tracks on the album from which Swamp Thing was taken, Evolver, heavily featured the treated guitar of Robert Fripp; it might be more fitting if they were remembered for 1990’s sublime Balearic classic Floatation, best heard in Norris and Andy Weatherall’s collaborative Subsonic Grid Mix.The Grid never split up – they released an entire collaborative album with Fripp in 2021 – but by the early 00s, Ball and Almond, who had intermittently worked together in the 90s, had reconvened Soft Cell. Their initial reformation, which produced 2002’s Cruelty Without Beauty album, quickly floundered after a disastrous American tour. They decided to finish things properly with a one-off 2018 farewell show at London’s O2 Arena, but ended up going on further tours and made a new album, Happiness Not Included. You could understand why their plans changed: the O2 show was rapturously received, a little chaotic and a potent reminder that Soft Cell were a pop duo like no other. Watching Almond leading the audience in a sing-along to Sex Dwarf, or Ball strafing 1983’s Meet Murder My Angel with howling noise from a modular synthesiser, it was hard not to boggle at the idea that this was a band who had ever graced the stage of Top of the Pops or the cover of Smash Hits.View image in fullscreen‘Beautiful, heartbreaking, frustrating, messy, combustible’ … Soft Cell in 2021.Photograph: Mike OwenBut they had, and you could never quite forget about it, because of the degree of influence their career exerted. They were the first, but certainly not the last British synth-pop duo to marry emotive vocals with icy electronics: Andy Bell of Erasure claimed they “never would have existed” had Soft Cell not existed first. At one extreme, Ball’s intro to Tainted Love has been sampled on hits by Rihanna, Pink and Flo-Rida. At the other, Trent Reznor was so inspired by what he called the “beautiful, heartbreaking, frustrating, messy, combustible” sound of The Art of Falling Apart and This Last Night in Sodom that he borrowed the title of the latter’s opening track for the first track of Nine Inch Nails’ The Downward Spiral: Mr Self Destruct.Being the musical link between Rihanna and Nine Inch Nails is no mean feat, but Dave Ball was not a man much given to blowing his own trumpet: “I just lurked in the background,” he once shrugged. In response, Marc Almond reiterated that overlooking his bandmate was a terrible misjudgement. “Soft Cell,” he told one interviewer firmly, “was more Dave than me”.Explore more on these topicsPop and rockMarc AlmondElectronic musicDave BallNorthern soulcommentShareReuse this content"

Now the president is building a place so gilded Nero would feel at home. Why did he pick an architect whose speciality is Catholic churches?Catherine SlessorThu 23 Oct 2025 11.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 23 Oct 2025 11.01 EDTShareAs if truffling thuggishly in pursuit of the Nobel peace prize wasn’t enough, the spectacle of bulldozers ripping into the White House is yet more evidence of Donald Trump’s unstinting quest for epic self-aggrandisement. Having decreed the East Wing not fit for purpose – namely, his purposes of swank and show – he plans to replace it with a faux classical bulletproof ballroom, capable of seating up to 650 partygoers.Renderings show a vast, glacially white aircraft hangar of a structure embellished with an ornate coffered ceiling, gilded Corinthian columns and drooping gold chandeliers. Nero, who conceivedthe originaldomusaurea, would feel right at home. Costing $250m (£187.5m), a sum to be extracted from sycophantic donors, Trump’s ballroom is one of the most grandiose White House projects to be implemented in more than a century, as he strives to bend the building – and US architecture more generally – to his will.His fetishisation of classicism – a recurring comfort blanket for despots of all stripes – is bleakly predictableOn re-assuming the presidency, one of his first executive orders – under the titleMaking Federal Architecture Beautiful Again– mandated that “traditional and classical architecture” should be the preferred style for all federal public buildings, with Trump having the final veto on designs. A similarly prescriptive order was enacted during Trump’s first spell in office, only to be rescinded by Joe Biden.So, having been here before, the American Institute of Architects is wearily wary, stating: “AIA is extremely concerned about any revisions that remove control from local communities, mandate official federal design preferences, or otherwise hinder design freedom, and add bureaucratic hurdles for federal buildings.”View image in fullscreenDoomed … a part of the East Wing is demolished to make way for the new ballroom.Photograph: Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty ImagesWhite House occupants do have a history of tweaking, expanding and remodelling. Theodore Roosevelt added the West Wing, Richard Nixon installed a bowling lane and Harry S Truman commissioned an entire reconstruction. Several first ladies have revamped the decor and furnishings, notably Jackie Kennedy, whosesoignéinteriors were designed to connect the presidential home more resonantly with American history.The now doomed East Wing, dating from 1902, has been a much-changed addition. Intermittently housing the office of the first lady, what’s left of it sits above the presidential emergency operations centre, a high security bunker built during the second world war. Vice-presidentDick Cheney and his retinue retreated thereduring the 9/11 attacks,as did Trumpat the start of the George Floyd protests in 2020.The man who landed the ballroom job is James McCrery, founder of Washington-based McCrery Architects and a trenchant advocate of classical architecture. “Americans love classical architecture,” he has said, “because it is our formative architecture – and we love our nation’s formation.” Ironically, McCrery began his career working for Peter Eisenman, the high priest of deconstructivism, before a conversion of Damascene proportions prompted him to renounce the avant garde and “rethink his modernist education”.View image in fullscreenNo fan of the White House … Trump holds a table seating chart of the ballroom in the renovated Oval Office.Photograph: Alex Brandon/APSpecialising in the design of “traditional” Catholic churches, McCrery was appointed by Trump during his first term to serve on the US Commission of Fine Arts, an independent federal agency with the power to review the “design and aesthetics” of all construction within Washington DC.Trump’s style edicts and building bombast exude a dictator-for-life megalomania vibe, as he barrels through his second term, with an unconstitutional third potentially in his sights. However, he is said to dislike the White House, finding it on the poky side, preferring to decamp to his Floridian resort Mar-a-Lago at every opportunity. The tone for his latest stay in the White House was set by his patio-fication of the Rose Garden, but he is now clearly aiming for a legacy more substantial than a bit of paving.His record as a “patron” of architecture has been shaped by his rollercoaster career as a property developer. To him, buildings are simply extruded capital. He has an enduring fondness for Louis XIV bling, epitomised by his enrobing of a 1960s Manhattan skyscraper in golden bronze cladding to transform it into the gleamingly phallic Trump International Hotel and Tower. His more recentengoldening of the Oval Office, described by White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt as a “golden office for the golden age”, has been unflatteringly compared toa professional wrestler’s dressing room.View image in fullscreenAn imperial wheeze … model of the new White House ballroom.Photograph: Kevin Lamarque/ReutersNonetheless, Trump’s experience as a developer was formative, in that it taught him he could get away with just about anything. It crystallised a poisonous bravado, now hardwired into the national political sphere. His fetishisation of classicism, a historically recurring comfort blanket for despots of all stripes, is bleakly predictable.“It gives Trump a narrative of authority and tradition,” says Daniel Abramson, professor of architectural history at Boston University, “and fits into his overarching strategy of undermining the established elites, including in architecture.”Another imperial wheeze, announced at a reception for prospective ballroom donors, is a huge triumphal arch, to be erected just across the Potomac river from the Lincoln Memorial. Modelled on the Parisian original and topped with a gilded, winged goddess of victory, the “Arc de Trump” is intended to commemorate the US’s 250th anniversary next year. In launching this newest vanity project, Trump said: “We love to fix up Washington.” Again, Nero would doubtless approve.Explore more on these topicsArchitectureDonald TrumpfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Others approach their older selves until they inhabit them, likeJim Broadbent. You have remained your same self: graceful, poised, elegant and eloquent. How do you do it?DrHugbineOne has absolutely no understanding of how one comes across. Well, I certainly don’t. I’m delighted [you] think that about me. I’ve never thought of myself as an older person. There are far more interesting things to think about – what’s going on in the characters’ minds, where they find themselves in the situation given by the playwright or the screenwriter. I think I’ve kept a naivety. Michael Grandage, a director who I know very well, saw Mrs Warren’s Profession on YouTube, which I did with Coral Browne a hundred years ago when I was 24, and said: “Physically, you’ve changed. But you haven’t changed.” I don’t know quite how to take that. Perhaps I’ve stayed the same.I can’t imagine being in any situation so terrible that the words, “Don’t worry – Penelope Wilton’s here” wouldn’t make things better. But what makes you lose your temper?CHARISMATA and arch54lgThis morning, I was driving to do some shopping. I cannot bear people who hoot behind you before the lights have changed. Motorbikes do it a lot. Especially those Deliveroo people. When they do hoot me, I go even slower. On a wider scale, listening to the news – I’m in a furious temper before I even start the day. But you have to listen. You have to take note of what’s happening in Gaza. It makes me angry when politicians start tonotdo what the populace wants them to do.View image in fullscreenWilton as Isobel Crawley in Downton Abbey.Photograph: Nick Briggs/ITVWhat’s the best perk of being Dame Penelope?Dr_J_A_ZoidbergI don’t use my title. It’s a private thing. I’ve been given it for the work I’ve done, not the work I’m doing. I’m delighted I was given it; I wished my parents had been alive to see it. What I can’t bear is when I get into an Uber and the driver says: “Hello Dame” – because they think my name is Dame. I’m too self-conscious to book into hotels as Dame, but I am rather annoyed when there is a list of titles – Mrs, Miss, Ms, Sir – but no Dame. Eileen Atkins and Maggie Smith used to feel the same.I assume you’d like the chance to play an absolute stinker?packratI’ve always wanted to be a baddie in a Bond movie. I could be Rosa Klebb [in From Russia With Love]. A great friend of my father’s was a renowned bachelor. Very late on in life, he was very badly advised by my mother to get married. The woman turned out to be half Rosa Klebb, half Rose and Crown, as in she was never far from a bar. She was absolutely ghastly. I’d like to play that sort of part. If only people would cast me in these things, I can be absolutely frightening as anything.Have you forgiven Simon Pegg for shooting you inShaun ofthe Dead?TopTrampI’ve forgiven him because he didn’t want to do it anyhow. When I rose up off the floor having turned into a zombie, he was stood there with a gun and said: “Oh, Penelope, I can’t do this.” I said: “You’ve got to. It’s in the film.” After I actually die, Edgar Wright said: “Penelope, you can’t do that.” I said: “Why not?” He said: “It’s too upsetting and frightening.” I said: “Look, I’ve turned into a zombie, for goodness sake. This is how they die.” They wanted me to tone it down a bit. I said: “Well, no, I’m sorry. I’m not going to tone it down. You’ll just have to cut it if you don’t like it.”What was it like working with Ricky Gervais?MrSOBaldrickIt was wonderful. He’s such a talented man. My scenes, where we met in that churchyard on that bench [in After Life] … he had such empathy for people who’d lost loved ones. It came out at a time when a lot of people were losing friends and family because of the pandemic and it really struck a chord. I would work with him again at the drop of a hat. Steven Spielberg is another. I did the BFG with him, and I would work with him again tomorrow.View image in fullscreenSmall victories … Wilton with Ian Holm in The Borrowers.Photograph: Photo 12/AlamyMy favourite role of yours isHomily Clock in The Borrowers. I’m watching it again for the umpteenth time with my young nieces. How did it feel to be a Borrower?DreadfulSpillerWell, they were lovely stories by Mary Norton. I was doing a play at the RSC, staying not far from Stratford. I was doing some shopping and a little girl saw me, and nearly passed out. She said: “Are you Homily? How do you fit in the television?” She was all of six. She asked if she could come for tea so I said yes, she could come for tea. She came with her mother for tea later on in the day in full party dress with her dog to show me. It was very charming. Another time, I was walking down Portobello Road, got tapped on the shoulder, turned round and there was the tallest Rastafarian guy I’ve ever seen, two metres! He said: “Excuse me, were you a Borrower? I loved that when I was small.”View image in fullscreenWilton as the queen in Steven Spielberg’s The BFG.Photograph: Doane Gregory/Walt Disney Pictures/AllstarYou played the queen in the BFG and thequeenmother inBackstairs Billy in 2023. How was it playing people who were so ingrained and loved by the public?CardiffSteThe queen was Roald Dahl’s Queen of England, although she did look similar. Her shoes, gloves: everything is for comfort because she had to stand for a long time. Her diadem had to fit so when she took it off, her hair didn’t look terrible. She had a sensible bag with a good clip so it closed. I put in a few dog biscuits because I thought that’s what the queen would do, for the corgis. The queen mother was shorter than me and had a much larger bust, so we had quite a lot of padding. When you start to look like the queen mother or the queen, it’s a lot easier to get into the mood.What are your memories of appearing inHarold Pinter’s Betrayal at the National in 1978, with Michael Gambon?WomanofWolfvilleI worked with Pinter six or seven times, so he became a good friend. Any new play is nerve-racking; [doing] one of Harold’s plays was particularly nerve-racking because he had a reputation. He liked actors, which not all writers and directors do, but he was intimidating when you first met him.View image in fullscreenTake your pick … Richard Briers, Wilton and Peter Egan in Ever Decreasing Circles.Photograph: AJ Pics/AlamyPaul or Martin?davidabsalomOh, that’s so cruel. I think, out of loyalty, Ann [from sitcom Ever Decreasing Circles] would’ve chosen Martin [played by Richard Briers], but she will always have yearned after Paul [Peter Egan]. In real life, I don’t think I would have stayed with Martin and would have probably gone off with Paul in a rather terrible way.Can you notpersuadethe producers to make one more Downton Abbey series or movie?Nicens_boiI’m afraid not. They may have other ideas. Who knows, there may be a prequel? I do get recognised for Downton Abbey and After Life. It depends where I am. I can always tell what they’re going to ask.

Honouring that wish became a monumental undertaking and the subject of a documentary releasing across Australia next week called Journey Home, David Gulpilil.Vale David Gulpilil: the inimitable actor who changed the movies, and changed usRead moreIt was a profound repatriation spanning more than 4,000 kilometres, unfolding over almost a year and beginning in Murray Bridge, South Australia, where Gulpilil was receiving treatment for terminal lung cancer. Planes, boats, vans and helicopters were variously commandeered to transport Gulpilil’s casket along the way; there were also long stretches on foot. It traced a path through landscapes that had shaped the actor’s life and legacy, and culminated in the place of his birth: Gupulul, on Yolŋu country, on 20 September 2022, almost 10 months after his death.The trailer for Journey Home, David GulpililCapturing this epic journey were film-makers Trisha Morton-Thomas and Maggie Miles, who have interwoven archival footage into the documentation of Gulpilil’s “one-way ticket home”, as he called it, and the 10-day funeral rituals, called Bäpurru, held in Ramingining and Gupulul, that lay him to rest.Filming was both emotionally and logistically demanding, the directing duo say.View image in fullscreenGulpilil was repatriated from Murray Bridge, South Australia, to be laid to rest in his homeland in East Arnhem Land.Photograph: Anna CaddenWe were thigh-deep in mangrove mud – you’d have a snowball’s chance in hell of getting out if a crocodile decides you’re dinnerTrisha Morton-Thomas, co-director“We’re all thinking on our feet the whole time,” Miles says. “You’ve got this balance of filming extraordinary culture and emotion … and really challenging logistics to think about. How we’re going to get from A to B? Have we got enough water? Is everyone coping well in the heat? There’s so many people and so much activity going on the whole time, you don’t have time to stop and reflect – you’ve just got to keep shooting.”View image in fullscreenGulpilil remained in Nhulunbuy’s mortuary for eight months due to the wet season, but the land did not dry up enough for him to be driven home.Photograph: Anna CaddenAfter three days on the road to Darwin, David’s body was flown to Nhulunbuy on the Gove Peninsula, with the plane flying low over communities so people could say goodbye. He then remained in Nhulunbuy’s mortuary for eight months as his grieving family waited out the wet season. Hopes that the land would dry up enough to drive Gulpilil to Gulpulul dwindled; a ranger’s barge, a helicopter and, at one point, what Gulpilil’s son Jamie calls a “zombie tinny” – no oars, no engine – was employed to navigate crocodile-infested tidal rivers.“We were thigh-deep in mangrove mud,” Morton-Thomas recalls. “And you knew you’d have a snowball’s chance in hell of getting out if a crocodile decides you’re dinner.”The 90-minute film, narrated by Hugh Jackman, features storytelling byBaker Boy, and is produced by Gulpilil’s eldest son, Jida Gulpilil.“There could have been an easier way – some people said, ‘Let’s lay him to rest [in Ramingining] where his brother is so that everyone can come,’” Jida says. “But after his passing, that’s when we really realised, we have to fulfil his wishes – by any means.”A two-week journey of ceremony, singing, dancing and cultural process through a system of tribes, clans and families culminated in Gulpilil’s burial, in a sacred place the actor had long protected – “Like he protected me,” Jida says.View image in fullscreen‘The family was so incredibly open with the access to the ceremonies,’ says co-director Trisha Morton-Thomas.Photograph: Allan CollinsSensitivity, experience in protocol and the implicit trust of the Yolŋu families involved were crucial when capturing two sacred ceremonies shown in the film: the Bäpurru, which took 10 days; and the initiation of Gulpilil’s grandson, which had been delayed to coincide with the funeral – a farewell to one man, the creation of another.Sign up for a weekly email featuring our best readsThere were moments when the camera needed to step back. “The family was so incredibly open with the access to the ceremonies,” says Morton-Thomas. “We had to hold up a moral bar to ourselves and say, no, we are not going to overstep this line. We’re going to allow the family to have their grief in these moments.”The archival footage used tracks Gulpilil’s career from the early 1970s. At age 16, his skill as a dancer caught the eye of British director Nicolas Roeg, and his 1971 film Walkabout launched a career that would span five decades (although his name was miscredited in the final cut and on the poster as “David Gumpilil”).skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFive Great ReadsFree weekly newsletterEach week our editors select five of the most interesting, entertaining and thoughtful reads published by Guardian Australia and our international colleagues.

He narratedTen Canoesin Yolŋu Matha, and delivered a haunting performance inCharlie’s Country, whichwon him best actor at Cannes in 2014.Gulpilil used to say he moved between the worlds of black and white Australia with ease; it was “easy, like drinking coffee – milk and two sugar”, he once told a journalist. But those close to him dispute this; his childhood friend Yingiya Mark Guyula, a Yolŋu man of the Djambarrpuyŋu clan and the Liya-Dhälinymirr people and now an independent member of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly, told the NT parliament after his death: “He walked in two worlds and sometimes it tore him apart.”View image in fullscreenA portrait of Gulpilil.Photograph: Michael RaynerNot included in Journey Home are Gulpilil’s later admissions,made in the 2021 documentary My Name is Gulpilil, that he became drug and alcohol dependent early in his career, culminating in two suspended sentences for domestic violence in 2011 and 2012.“Yes, he did struggle,” Jida says now, “but he did it with grace. I watched him in those two worlds, but he taught me, I think, to survive it better with the education that he never was able to get.”Gulpilil’s distinction as an Indigenous actor who achieved international acclaim while staying deeply rooted in traditional life, remains. Despite his father’s long absences during his film career, Jida remembers his regular returns to country with warmth.“He did go away a lot, but we were happy to stay home and wait for him to finish his work and come and share his work with us and watch his films over and over,” he says. “We loved it when he would go out there and share his and our culture to the world.”Gulpilil never could seem to get by financially – because he was always giving everything away. As one of his relatives says in Journey Home: “Some people were mystified. They reckon he would be the richest Yolŋu man on planet Earth.”But Gulpilil’s own view of wealth was simple. “When I get paid for film, I share with my family,” he says in the film. “That’s what I do with money.”View image in fullscreenA still from the 2025 documentary Journey Home, David Gulpilil.Photograph: Maggie MilesJida’s promise to his father didn’t end with the burial. He is now planning to build a house, based on a design by Glenn Murcutt, on the site where Gulpilil is laid to rest, where all of the actor’s awards and memorabilia will be displayed. Through millions in mining royalties and government grants, the Yolŋu clan have built infrastructure in and around the site, including a new 100km road that previously disappeared after every wet season. Jida and his younger brother Jamie plan to live there full time.Asked what he hopes audiences, especially non-Indigenous viewers, take away from the documentary, Jida reflects: “I know my father would have wanted everyone to go away and feel like they were a part of this. That they went away and had a greater understanding about who he really was to his family.”“Pride,” adds Miles. “Pride in this incredible human being who was proud of being Australian. His whole life was dedicated to building a bridge between two cultures.”Journey Home, David Gulpilil is in Australian cinemas from 30 October.Explore more on these topicsAustralian filmIndigenous AustraliansDocumentary filmsYolngufeaturesShareReuse this content"

Oprah Winfrey and Debbie Allen were among those who gave speeches of praise.Winfrey spoke of the power of young people of color seeing Copeland lead iconic ballets like Swan Lake.“Misty didn’t just perform ballet,” Winfrey said of the ballerina who has achieved a unique crossover fame. “She changed it. She redefined who belongs, who gets to be seen, and who gets to lead.”In a way, the gala was both a return and a departure for Copeland, 43. She was dancing with the company for the first time in five years. During that time, Copeland has been raising a son, Jackson, with her husband. The three-year-old came onstage to hug his mother during curtain calls, wearing a tuxedo.View image in fullscreenMisty Copeland and Oprah Winfrey.Photograph: Guerin Charles/ABACA/ShutterstockCopeland has also been continuing her career as an author – the second volume of her Bunheads series appeared in September – and working to increase diversity in the dance world with her namesake foundation, including Be Bold, an afterschool program designed for young children of color.But she decided to dust off the pointe shoes so she could have one last spin on the ABT stage – including as Juliet, one of the most passionate roles in ballet and her personal favorite. Copeland’s Romeo in the balcony pas de deux was Calvin Royal III, who in 2020 became ABT’s first Black male principal dancer in two decades.The duo later reappeared for another duet, this time a modern one, in Wrecka Stow, by Kyle Abraham. For Copeland’s final performance of the night, she performed Twyla Tharp’s Sinatra Suite with another of her favorite partners, Herman Cornejo.The night, which also celebrated ABT’s 85th anniversary and was curated in large part by Copeland herself, included speeches and film clips about her career. And her fellow dancers performed excerpts of ballets in her honor.At the end, a beaming Copeland was given a quintessential ballet farewell, as colleagues, teachers, friends and family came out to greet her, one by one, with hugs and bouquets while glittery confetti poured from the rafters.View image in fullscreenCopeland, center, takes a bow during curtain calls at her retirement performance at the David H Koch Theater at Lincoln Center in New York City.Photograph: Rosalie O’Connor/APOn the carpet Wednesday before her performance, she said: “I feel good. I feel ready to take this next step.” She noted that she would be continuing her work promoting diversity: “There’s so much work and effort that has to be continuous.”The evening at Lincoln Center’s David H Koch Theater was streamed live to nearby Alice Tully Hall across the plaza, with attendance free to the public – another sign of Copeland’s unique brand of fame in the dance world.Copeland was born in Kansas City, Missouri, and raised in San Pedro, California, where she lived in near poverty and through periods of homelessness as her single mother struggled to support her and five siblings.For a future professional dancer, she came to ballet relatively late – at 13 – but soon excelled and went on to study at the San Francisco Ballet School and ABT on scholarship opportunities. After a stint in the junior company, Copeland joined ABT as a member of the corps de ballet in April 2001, becoming a soloist six years later. In June 2015, Copeland was promoted to principal dancer.Explore more on these topicsBalletNew YorkDancenewsShareReuse this content"

It’s perhaps no surprise then that The Shelter of Stories, a new exhibition curated by the leading mythographer, contains much to tingle spines as well as tickle fancies.There are artworks drawing on alternative folkloric worlds by top contemporary artists such asPaula Regoor Kiki Smith, while old master paintings confront spiritual or social horrors. It boasts a wealth of offbeat ephemera too, including Red Riding Hood as an early kids’ board game and taxidermy dioramas with a rodent fortune teller and avian peddler of love potions. The curator’s own collection of Mexican Ex Voto paintings shows how ordinary people have recorded and given thanks for overcoming their own dramas, be it fire or an inconvenient spouse.The works span centuries but Warner is driven by present-day concerns. It was her recent project with refugees,Stories in Transit, that prompted her to create the show, which follows her recent bookSanctuaryin unpacking how storytelling can build bridges in an increasingly divided world. “The shelter of stories,” she explains, “is about a tale told in a circle of listeners, all remembering, embellishing and making up the story, with bonds created between strangers by doing it together.” Thus, the exhibition’s emphasis is less on what stories are being told than how.The connection between storytelling and refuge is underlined by artworks such as Yinka Shonibare’s scaled-down recreations of historical safehouses, including a waypoint on the underground railway used by enslaved Africans escaping to the American north, and Mounira Al Solh’s textiles, which hang tent-like from the ceiling. Their embroideries and silkscreened lettering reference conflict in Lebanon and the myths and histories circling the cedar tree on the country’s flag.Although such works touch on real events, the kind of storytelling that interests Warner is not the eye-witness account. While she affirms that “testimony is vital to everyone’s personhood and visibility”, she sees the legal framework that demands refugees must repeatedly recount their circumstances in this way without any deviation or change, as “diminishing our freedom as individuals because we all tell our stories differently for different people”.What Warner makes the case for is storytelling’s potential to create an imaginative space where “we reach beyond the borders of our own experience”. It’s a point evinced by the huge variety of props on show and through which tellers bring characters to life, from Punch and Judy to Indonesian shadow puppets used in Hindu Sanskrit tales, or the headdresses from Nigeria’s Yoruba Egungun masquerades.The exhibition is a reminder, too, of the storytelling traditions that give the downtrodden an outlet. “Laughter is a corrective to abusive power,” says Warner. “It’s the recourse of the underdog, the underprivileged, anybody who is crushed.” The show mines the age-old art of lampooning, from the animal with human follies in cautionary tales like Aesop’s Fables to the political satire in Jonathan Baldock’s giant mask installation Pa Abu of 2015, reviving the impulsive tyrant from Alfred Jarry’s absurdist 1886 play Ubu Roi.Baldock’s despot with his lolling red tongue recalls today’s King Ubus and their divisive, polarising narratives. What undergirds the huge variety of stories on show here though, from Greek epics to the Brothers Grimm, is that they’re collective efforts, cross-pollinated travelling tales that have passed through different places and cultures, with fears faced by people getting together around the fireside. Warner cites famed lines by the playwright Bertolt Brecht as a guiding principle: “In the dark times, will there be singing? Yes, there will also be singing. About the dark times.”The Shelter of Stories: Ways of Telling, Ways of Dwelling is at Compton Verney, Warwick,25 Octoberto 22 February.Myth congeniality: works on display at the exhibitionPaula Rego: Secrets and Stories, 1989 (main image)Rego depicts her huddled women and children telling tales like little islands in the dark, their rapt faces apparently illuminated by delight at what they’re hearing. “It’s about personal stories and alternative informal networks,” says Warner.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Hugh Pryor/Photography HughSaad Qureshi: A Handful of Paradise, 2024Drawn from conversations with people of all faiths, Bradford-born sculptor Saad Qureshi’s A Handful of Paradise is an exquisitely detailed landscape with a delicate tower in enclosed gardens.

But on the other hand, I’m alive. I can work.”Skarsgård, 74, said he was “not afraid of dying, but I am afraid of not being capable of living. That is a fear.“I feel a little more like I live under the sword now,” he continued. “Because I’ve lived a naughty life. And I’m 74, which is already on overtime.”He added that “being boring” continued to be a concern, both for him and his offspring.“With all my eight kids, there’s one thing I’ve been afraid of every time I have a new kid … that they’re boring. Luckily, none of them were.”A number of Skarsgård’s children – including Alexander, Bill and Gustaf – are actors, but he rejected the idea that they had been successful on account of their father.“I consider myself a nepo daddy,” he said, “because I get so much goodwill and maybe jobs because of them.” Both he and Alexander had films screening at the Telluride film festival in late August, he continued, recalling that when his eldest son exited the Sentimental Value screening “he came out, destroyed in his face, and he hugged me.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFilm WeeklyFree newsletterTake a front seat at the cinema with our weekly email filled with all the latest news and all the movie action that mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

British peer says Oasis will play Knebworth – then rows backExclusive: Lady Taylor of Stevenage says suggestion band would perform over five days in July 2026 was ‘hypothetical’Lanre Bakare,Joshua SurteesandAletha AduThu 23 Oct 2025 11.28 EDTLast modified on Thu 23 Oct 2025 21.30 EDTShareThe wood-panelled chambers of theHouse of Lordsaren’t renowned for rock’n’roll hyperbole or for being a place where big music announcements are made.So when a British peer stood in the upper house and declared thatOasiswould perform five back-to-back anniversary gigs at Knebworth House, the music world barely noticed.The concerts, a re-enactment of pop-culture folklore nearly as famous in the UK as the Beatles’ rooftop gig or Freddie Mercury’s turn at Live Aid, would mark the 30th anniversary of the group’s record-breaking first visit.The band played two concerts to 250,000 people at theHertfordshirestately home in 1996 that sold out in less than 24 hours. It is thought that 2% of the British population applied for tickets.And on Wednesday, Lady Taylor of Stevenage said: “Next July, I will have the benefit of five days of Oasis concerts in the fantastic venue of Knebworth House, which is just about a mile away from my house.”‘We were drunk all the time!’: how Oasis got mad for it – in picturesRead moreThe Labour peer added: “I can hear and enjoy [the gigs] from my house, and they represent the important cultural role of music venues and … make an enormous contribution to our economy.”Yet hours after sthat statement, she rowed back on what she had said in the chamber.She told the Guardian: “I was speaking hypothetically following speculation that they would play Knebworth again as they did in August 1996. I understand the band have not confirmed this.”The peer said she had been comparing the proposed event with the local festival Old Town Live, during a discussion about the decline of music venues and the fact new bands were finding it harder to move from local gigs to the stadium concerts Oasis are now playing.Representatives of Oasis declined to comment, but the Guardian understands the band’s management is unaware of the suggested five-night stand.Some people have been holding out hope that the concerts could happen. The current occupant of the property, Henry Lytton-Cobbold, invited the band to play an anniversary gig in 2024.“Wembley is a reasonable warmup venue for Knebworth,” he joked after thereunion gigs were announced. “Then get ready for a nice huge 30th shindig in 2026.”When approached by the Guardian after Oasis’s press team had poured cold water on the gigs, Lytton-Cobbold encouraged the band to get in touch.He said: “Clearly it’s what the people want, clearly it should happen – but let’s get it in the diary, as our summer 2026 weekends are swiftly filling up.”The dates would be another huge cultural moment for the band, who dominated the summer of 2025 with a reunion tour that included sellout dates at Wembley.The UK’s summer of Oasis is over – but the unity and euphoria it created is unforgettable | Emma GarlandRead moreOasis are now in South Asia for a leg of their world tour, which includes gigs in South Korea and Japan. Their concerts this year are the first time Liam andNoel Gallagherhave performed together since 2009.The band played Knebworth in 1996 a year after the release of their second album, (What’s the Story) Morning Glory?, which went in at No 1, with the gig seen as the crowning moment in their career.The two gigs, alongside the Maine Road concerts, also in 1996, have become a key part of Oasis lore. They have inspireddocumentaries, and Liam Gallagher returned to the stately home in 2022for a solo gig.While that performance earned mixed reviews, the reunion tour has been seen as one of the most successful – andlucrative– returns in British music history.Taylor, the former leader of Stevenage borough council, which neighbours Knebworth in rural Hertfordshire, made the comments in response to the Tory peer Lady McIntosh of Pickering’s concerns that planning legislation threatened the small venues that Oasis and others played on their rise to stadium tours.“Of the 34 venues Oasis played to launch their careers, only 11 remain. The figures speak for themselves,” McIntosh said.Ticket sales for new Knebworth shows would be highly scrutinised after the “dynamic pricing” employed when fans tried to buy tickets for the original run of reunion gigs, with tickets originally priced at £148.50, rebranded as “in demand” and soaring to £355.20.For now the gigs are just rumours, albeit ones started in the upper house – but Oasis fans might want to start checking Hansard, rather than social media, for the next big announcement from their favourite band.Explore more on these topicsOasisHertfordshireEnglandLiam GallagherNoel GallagherHouse of LordsnewsShareReuse this content"

Institutions are failing, or reassembling themselves along new and disquieting lines. An unseen force “is destroying the air and the seasons”; at the same time, “money’s going bad, and no one knows why”. Power is flowing away from governments, and pooling in the offices of theocrats, the coffers of conglomerates, the hands of mobs. “Something is at work, very quietly, very subtly”, says merchant Mustafa Bey, keeping a watchful eye on the Silk Roads from his seat in an Aleppo cafe. “Things we thought were firm and solid are weakening and giving way.”Just what that something might be, and how to counteract it, is the question that animates The Rose Field, which picks up whereThe Secret Commonwealthleft off. This is, by all accounts, Pullman’s concluding foray into the intricately constructed, infinitely beguiling realm he first unveiled 30 years ago, with the publication of Northern Lights. It’s a realm whose geography maps on to that of this world, but whose history tacks and jibes with ours; where the humans look and think and act like us, but are accompanied by daemons, souls in animal form; where the skies are filled with witches and gryphons, but beneath those skies, buses are caught and tea is drunk, and middle-aged academics carry Harrods shopping bags. Lyra, whom we first met as a 12-year-old in the His Dark Materials trilogy, and then saw again as a baby inLa Belle Sauvage, the prequel with which Pullman began The Book of Dust, is now a young woman: still recognisably the spiky and tenacious heroine of the earlier books, but older, sadder, more cautious, less certain. This circumscription is amplified by her separation from her daemon, Pantalaimon – but it was also, ironically, the trigger which caused him to abandon her in the first place.Pan’s decision to go off in search of that childlike part of Lyra which she seems to have lost (an aspect which he epitomises as her “imagination”), and her quest to reunite with him, were the incitements of The Secret Commonwealth, which saw Lyra undertake a picaresque journey across Europe and into the Caucasus, meeting with marvel and danger on the way. But from the outset, deeper currents were in motion, and darker forces at work. The Magisterium – the church’s governing authority, and Pullman’s deliciously chilling embodiment of austere, bureaucratic evil – is under new leadership, and flexing its muscles. Marcel Delamare – Lyra’s uncle, who blames her for his sister’s death – has manoeuvred himself into the role of president of the Magisterium’s High Council, and is intent on using his newfound power to extend the church’s dominium. Malcolm Polstead, who carried baby Lyra to safety along a flooded Thames as an 11-year-old in La Belle Sauvage, is now an Oxford don with a sideline in intelligence work: he is dispatched to Geneva to find out more about Delamare’s intentions. And behind all of this is the mystery surrounding the rare and valuable rose oil which seems somehow to be the source of a social and economic crisis rippling out from Central Asia. The oil is seen by some as a tradeable commodity, by others as a scientific or spiritual miracle, and by others still – the fanatical “men from the mountains” – as a source of evil; an affront that must be obliterated. The question of where it comes from, what it stands for, and whether it should be destroyed or protected is coming rapidly to the fore.As in His Dark Materials, Lyra’s actions, and her destiny, are revealed to be inextricably entwined with the fate of the worldIn The Secret Commonwealth, these storylines ran broadly in parallel. In The Rose Field, they converge. As in His Dark Materials, Lyra’s actions and her destiny are revealed to be inextricably entwined with the fate of the world. Her personal quest to reunite with her daemon and recover her imagination becomes the key battleground in a wider war with an authoritarian regime which, as such regimes always have, is seeking to quell independence of thought, creativity and art: all the internal, rebellious ways in which people can be free.The novel begins with the discovery of a series of curious fissures in the fabric of the Earth’s atmosphere: windows that seem to give on to other worlds. One such window appears to be the source of the highly contested rose oil. The Magisterium, with Delamare at its head, designates these windows as a challenge to the church’s orthodoxy and sets out to eradicate them. As Lyra begins to turn away from rigid rationalism and back to intuition, however, her conviction that these sites must be protected – that what they stand for and what they offer is somehow essential – grows. “Dust, or rose oil, or the imagination, or the Rose Field, or whatever we call it,” she says, “we need it.” The stage for a Blakean tussle between innocence and experience is set.At 640 pages, The Rose Field gives itself the time it needs to bring Pullman’s trilogy to a fitting conclusion, but there are points when it seems to wend its way rather too circuitously to a close. Minor characters are on occasion introduced without definite purpose, and there are moments where apparent advances in the narrative turn out to be cul-de-sacs. But the story’s internal motor is strong enough to carry us over these digressions. Lyra’s journey into adulthood feels both painful and plausible and, once again, Pullman uses her relationship with her daemon to reify and explore her internal struggles in a manner that is unique to his imaginative universe. Malcolm is an unexpectedly successful replacement for Will, Lyra’s foil in the first trilogy: he is a rich, full character in his own right, and his feelings for Lyra, and hers for him, offer a complex, adult counterpoint to the relationship between Will and Lyra in His Dark Materials. Pullman’s uncanny ability to conjure place, meanwhile, is once again in full evidence: the snows of Svalbard and Oxford’s clutter of rooftops are exchanged for the Silk Roads’ sweeping deserts and soaring mountains. And when we reach it, the novel’s final showdown is a fantastically nail‑biting ride.Endings, though, are always difficult, and for Pullman, the challenge is compounded by the fact that His Dark Materials delivered one of the most emotionally and intellectually satisfying conclusions in modern literature. In The Book of Dust, by contrast, there is a sense of threads left unknotted; ends only lightly tucked away. But this feels, in the final analysis, like an intentional choice on Pullman’s part: the ultimate reflection of the fact that The Book of Dust is a story for grownups, not children, and storybook endings are another casualty of the putting away of childish things. “There are no endings,” said Hilary Mantel on the final page ofBring Up the Bodies; “they are all beginnings.” Pullman draws his great matter to a close, but he’s clear that his characters, and their stories, will continue without him – that the end of his book marks the start of their next chapter. “We need the things we can’t explain, can’t prove, or else we die of suffocation,” says Lyra, towards the end of the novel. With The Book of Dust, Pullman has given us room to breathe.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

This happens whenBruce Springsteenfinally leaves his New Jersey heartland, and sees a shrink in shallow LA where he has bought a house. Otherwise, it’s all chunks of expositional dialogue (“I’m just trying to find something real in the noise!” “It’s like he’s channelling something deeply personal!”), black-and-white flashbacks to his tough upbringing, scenes in the recording studio with producers and execs looking on wonderstruck behind the glass while the magic happens. And there’s some very strange stuff about Bruce’s romantic life.Jeremy Allen White does an intelligent, committed job as Springsteen; Jeremy Strong gives of his considerable best with the thanklessly dull role of Bruce’s manager and friend Jon Landau, and Stephen Graham is Springsteen’s abusive but troubled dad Douglas with whom Springsteen finally comes to terms. In fact White and Graham have the film’s best scene, a scene so weird that it must surely be true. Springsteen’s old dad, waiting humbly and penitently in the Boss’s dressing room after the show, asks Bruce in a voice filled with pathos to sit on his knee and Springsteen has to point out gently that he is a grown man and has in fact never done this before in his life, not even as a kid.The meat of the film’s drama is a key moment of emotional and artistic crisis in Springsteen’s life: the recording of his radically lo-fi acoustic album Nebraska in 1982, composed and largely recorded in the bedroom of hisNew Jerseyhouse. It was an artistic indulgence which the record company nervously permitted because they had in their back pocket the thrilling track that would later make Springsteen stratospheric: Born in the USA. The album is inspired by figures as various as Flannery O’Connor and notorious Nebraska spree killer Charles Starkweather, the model for Martin Sheen in Terrence Malick’s film Badlands. It’s also about whether you should embrace or escape your home town.It’s all unexceptional enough; but the film also invents for Springsteen an imaginary girlfriend called Faye Romano, played by Odessa Young, supposedly the sister of a guy from the old neighbourhood; she has a daughter from a former relationship. Springsteen dates Faye in all her realness and integrity, but ultimately leaves her behind. So how about Faye’s daughter? She has been encouraged to think of Bruce as her stepdad, so will she one day think of Bruce in those heart-rending black-and-white flashback terms? Or are she and her mum just there to underscore Bruce’s caring blue-collar masculinity? The film is a derivative, if well intentioned, piece of fan fiction.Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere is out on 23 October in Australia, and on 24 October in the UK and US.Explore more on these topicsFilmBiopicsBruce SpringsteenJeremy Allen WhiteJeremy StrongStephen GrahamNew JerseyreviewsShareReuse this content"

His mum and dad were two hard-working actor-comedians who had a very successful TV double act in the 60s and 70s and a long marriage. This has been the source of so much material, based on the quarrels and tensions to which Ben and his sister Amy were intimate witnesses.Both parents’ backgrounds were hard. Anne’s mother had taken her own life; Jerry’s dad was tough and unsupportive. Perhaps they never experienced the full status of stardom that their son has enjoyed, although Jerry had a new lease of late-life TV fame in the 90s with his superb portrayal of George Costanza’s dad in Seinfeld. The film is centred on Ben and Amy clearing out their mum and dad’s New York apartmentafter Jerry died in 2020; Anne haddied in 2015. And Ben Stiller himself emerges as a complex and unresolved personality from this film: he considers the fact that his parents were sometimes not there for him because of the pressures of show business, and that he himself was not around for his own children because of being away on film sets. He and his wife Christine Taylor separated for three years but reunited in 2020.And perhaps Ben has discovered something that Jerry and Meara discovered – but suppressed and kept smiling like the troupers that they were. Show business is a cruel vocation not simply because it takes you away from your family, but because it always promises a level of superstar euphoria that is fleeting, or never arrives at all; someone else is more successful than you, someone else has more awards, someone else’s project gets commissioned. When Amy tells Ben on camera how tough it was for her to be waitressing while he was becoming a movie star, he can only smile sadly.There is also an intriguing and very revealing sketch that Ben did as a young kid, based on family therapy sessions they once had, when the comically obnoxious Ben tells Jerry the father is less famous than the son. Then Amy infuriates Ben with an anecdote about him wetting the bed. An intriguing, bittersweet family study.Stiller & Meara: Nothing Is Lost is on Apple TV+ from 24 October.Explore more on these topicsFilmDocumentary filmsBen StillerComedy filmsTV comedySeinfeldParents and parentingreviewsShareReuse this content"

Twentysomething Niall is deeply distressed and calls his sister, Brigid, in an attempt to stem his agony and slow his racing mind. Their conversation is surprisingly funny as Brigid, who keeps whispering to someone in bed beside her, attempts to placate her brother. The dialogue brims with affection, frustration, fear and sorrow, as well as an electric tension as we wait for Niall – clearly on the edge of doing something quite terrible – to make up his mind.That’s just the opening scene of Eoin McAndrew’s vivid new play. The winner of the 2024 Verity Bargate award, it is quite hard to categorise but very easy to admire and enjoy. As Niall attempts to recover from his breakdown, the play initially verges on satire. A bewildered Brigid (Catherine Rees) is met with a barrage of absurd advice, as she tries to keep her brother – who has just set himself on fire – from further self-harm. Stashing the candles away, suggests McAndrew, probably isn’t going to fix this.View image in fullscreenSpiky … Laura Dos Santos (left) and Catherine Rees in Little Brother.Photograph: Camilla GreenwellIn Emma Jordan’s assured production, the satirical sections are aided by spikily comic performances from Laura Dos Santos (as a doctor and counsellor) and Conor O’Donnell (as Brigid’s sidelined and increasingly sulky boyfriend). McAndrew’s writing pulses with fury at a care system that is even more broken than the swathes of people who need help. However, despite being funny and pointed, these scenes also jar a little next to the subtler and more effective domestic scenes between Brigid, her boyfriend and her brother.Barrier(s) review – tender yet tough account of a queer couple’s connectionRead moreRecent graduate Cormac McAlinden captivates as Niall, who is such a convincing muddle of feelings – corrosively disturbed but also capable of silliness, tenderness, pettiness and joy. In one unforgettable scene, McAlinden claws at himself, scrapes at the floor, rages and bounces off the walls of Zoë Hurwitz’s striking set, a series of interlocking white cubes, blank and confining. The periphery of the set throbs and glows, revealing a series of pipes – the inner workings of a troubled city, a restless body and a disturbed mind.AtSoho theatre, London, until 22 NovemberIn the UK and Ireland,Samaritanscan be contacted on freephone 116 123, or emailjo@samaritans.orgorjo@samaritans.ie.

Alana (Em Prendergast) is hearing, while Katie (Zoë McWhinney) is deaf.Created by Deafinitely Theatre, which blends British Sign Language and spoken English, the play moves from the initial awkwardness of their first meeting at a kids’ party, through Alana’s early missteps, into a big, heart-on-sleeve portrait of their relationship’s highs and lows.Eloise Pennycott’s script unfolds episodically: one year, Alana struggles with the basics of BSL; the next, the couple sign to each other with ease. From the outset, electricity runs between them, shown best in quiet sections of movement directed by Raffie Julien. McWhinney and Prendergast build Katie and Alana’s relationship into one of tenderness and care. Each look is charged by their connection, and there’s a lot of laughter between them, too.Staged by the company’s artistic director, Paula Garfield, the play has a sugary, storybook quality at first: sketches appear across a back wall to establish the setting of each scene. Together, the couple celebrate anniversaries and dream about their future: even when they argue, it’s not long before they are back in each other’s arms.Underneath the romance is the reality of a broken, unfair system. Even while pregnant, it takes Katie weeks to get a doctor’s appointment with a BSL interpreter and the school for deaf children where she works is constantly under threat of closure. Marie Zschommler’s sound design swells with anger in moments of tension and the sense of injustice is stark.The ending breaks away from everything that’s come before as the script is literally torn up and the pair launch into a celebration of Deaf culture. It is uplifting, but the breaking-the-fourth-wall shift feels overfamiliar. Frustratingly, it leaves the main story hanging, and with so much life thrown into Alana and Katie, we long to properly bid them farewell. Still, it’s definitely important, hard-hitting stuff from a company that continues to educate and entertain.AtBirmingham Repuntil 25 October.

All six works here are familiar fare, the common thread being the late-19th and early 20th-century French enthusiasm for all things Spanish. It’s the kind of programme the record industry thrived on in the 1960s and 70s. There’s nothing dusty about the playing, however, nor the state-of-the-art recording, which possesses sonic depth while leaving plenty of space for the music’s delicate perfumes to waft to the surface.View image in fullscreenAlbum cover art for Iberia.Photograph: OnyxFor all his reserves of Venezuelan fire, Hindoyan takes a measured approach, resisting the temptation to grandstand. The results are frequently revelatory, with much that strikes the ear anew: diaphanous textures, addictive Latin rhythms and perfectly judged releases of musical adrenaline. Listen, for example, to the colours he brings out in Chabrier’s España, the RLPO firing on all cylinders with opulent tone and distinguished solos.Ravel’s Alborada del Gracioso, every detail immaculately crafted, explodes with energy, wriggling its hips while cocking an irreverent snook. Ibéria, the central panel of Debussy’s three orchestral Images, comes up fresh as a daisy, swinging, sultry and celebratory in turn. In short, an hour and a quarter of musical sunshine.Explore more on these topicsClassical musicRoyal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestraalbum reviewsShareReuse this content"

Tom and Amy have been together for 30 years. He believes theirs to be a “C-minus marriage” which was irreparably ruptured when Amy had an affair 12 years previously. And so, after leaving their daughter Miriam at college in Pittsburgh, he keeps on driving, revisiting old friends and places in search of his departed youth.Benjamin Markovits’s 12th novel – which has been shortlisted for this year’s Booker prize – could be seen as a companion piece to Miranda July’s celebratedAll Foursin its exploration of the dissatisfaction of middle age. Tom is not a reliable narrator of his life, though he is nonetheless a compelling protagonist even in his flagrant moments of self-deception.The voice actor Eric Meyers is the narrator who expertly conveys Tom’s bubbling discontent, even if there’s a slight panto quality to his voicing of female characters. We gradually gather there are wider issues fomenting Tom’s unhappiness, from a simmering illness that he imagines is long Covid, and about which he has so far declined to see a doctor, to the forced sabbatical from his job following complaints from his students. Tom, who hasn’t told his wife about his work difficulties, clearly believes he is more sinned against than sinning. But much like July’s nameless heroine in All Fours, he finds freedom and fresh perspective on the open road.Available via Faber, 6hr 56min.Further listeningDon’t Make Me LaughJulia Raeside, Bedford Square & WF Howes, 11hr 13minElizabeth Bower reads this smart, insightful debut set in the world of comedy in which female producer with self-esteem issues befriends a male performer whose attentiveness masks a dark and predatory agenda.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

But then, we aren’t heading to the usual hot, heady holiday destinations of Spain or the south of France, but boarding a train to north-east Europe. For me, it will be a journey of more than 1,000 miles – via Amsterdam, Berlin and Warsaw to Vilnius – visiting some of the coolest capitals in the north. At least in terms of temperature.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.As England sweltered this summer, and Spain reached a hellish 46C, it made sense to head away from the heat on what is now fashionably being called a “coolcation”. I left in August, with a suitcase full of jumpers.There is something irresistibly romantic about long train trips, watching the geography unfold outside the window. I leave London for Amsterdam on the Eurostar, eating a pain au chocolat as we speed through rural French flatlands and glide past red-roofed Belgian farmhouses, and then the distinctive, tall art nouveau buildings of the Netherlands. In Amsterdam, I switch trains to theDeutsche Bahn, grabbing a packet ofStroopwafeland jumping on board alongside cool Dutch kids with asymmetric hair. I know we have entered Germany when I spot a VW factory, and the graffiti becomes better – and more profuse.As for my coolcation, it feels burning hot when I arrive in Berlin, emerging from the glass and steel Hauptbahnhof into a summer evening where hipsters on deckchairs are drinking cocktails atCapital Beachon the Spree River.View image in fullscreenCapital Beach in Berlin.Photograph: Travelstock44/AlamyThe next morning, I stroll through the lush Tiergarten past men in black leathers chugging in theBiergarten; through the shadowy blocks of the Holocaust memorial; under the intimidating Brandenburg Gate. I’m heading to Alexanderplatz – where teenagers congregate under the TV tower – and I’m ruminating on how eastern European cities have a harsher aesthetic than those in the soft south. The remnants of the Soviet era echo in the hardness of the culture, in the brutalist architecture I’m passing, and then suddenly as pounding techno surrounds me. Marching down Unter Den Linden, I find myself caught in a procession of floats surrounded by people wearing all black, looking like they’re heading toBerghainnightclub.My next train, from Berlin to Warsaw, is theIC Intercitylink. It’s a Polish train, on which the carriages are split into comfortable six-person compartments. In one of these I sit opposite a boy with a mohawk eating paprika crisps, and I watch the city turn to pine forests of pale thin trees.The Stalin-era Palace of Culture and Science in Warsaw now runs silent-disco nights and serves matcha crepesTrain journeys mimic cruises – you hop on and off in different cities (ideal for my ADHD) and, in between, lounge around eating too much. It’s a five-hour journey from Berlin to Warsaw,and when gazing at farmland becomes monotonous, the restaurant carriage offers distraction. I orderKotlet schabowy(€10.50), and a delicious plate of breaded pork chop, cucumber salad and floury boiled potatoes appears, which I eat surrounded by men with blond buzzcuts drinking Żywiec beers.It’s startling to emerge from the bunker of Warsaw Central station to a horizon of glass skyscrapers reflecting the deep red sky.The next day, I discover Warsaw – a captivating juxtaposition of history and modernity. In the Old Town, I eatpierogibesideMarie Curie’s house, then explore cobbled streets with bright rows of coloured medieval buildings, which were bombed during the second world war but have been so faithfully reconstructed they have earnedUnesco status. Their Disneyland-esque quality is only lessened by the artillery pockmarks.View image in fullscreenMarie Curie’s house in Warsaw.Photograph: Konrad Zelazowski/AlamyElsewhere, austere Soviet buildings have morphed into hipster cafes with oak counters and earthenware cups.BarStudio, below the Stalin-eraPalace of Culture and Science– now reclaimed as a tourist attraction with an observation deck – runs silent-disco nights and serves matcha crepes from a menu decorated ironically with communist-era cartoons.Taking a train is far easier than flying – there’s no negotiating airport security or check-in – and soon I become dangerously casual, running and hopping onboard with a picnic of local foods.We roll out of Warsaw and I sit munching Kopernik iced gingerbread biscuits as we pass endless farmland, the occasional dilapidated dacha, factories and small towns of Identikit modern houses in grids. Today’s journey to Vilnius will take nine hours, so it’s a relief when at Mockava, on the Lithuanian border, we are ejected on to a remote platform in a sunny forest. I stand sweltering in 26C heat, wondering why I packed so many jumpers.View image in fullscreenBohemian rhapsody … Užupis district in Vilnius.Photograph: Gediminas Medziausis/Getty ImagesThe black, double-height Lithuanian train is open-plan, modern, slick and packed full of heaving bike racks, but the dining options are disappointingly limited. I eat a sad toasted-cheese sandwich as we glide through more farmland and forests.Vilnius, although the most eastern city I’m travelling to, feels the most western in style. Its baroque buildings – including cathedrals that survived the Soviets and have earned itUnesco status– blend into art nouveau architecture. Even former communist blocks here are painted in soft pastels, and wide boulevards (a USSR endeavour) open up a lush city.

But the enthusiasm for capitalism is evident in the number of luxury Lithuanian boutiques and western brands such as H&M and Mango, and a growing tech industry: Vinted is based here.Užupis, the bohemian quarter – where art exhibitions and Banksy-style graffiti adorn the streets – has its own logo: a blue hand with a hole in the middle. My guide says it shows that money falls through in an enticement to spend, spend, spend, but Užupis’s own tourism minister, Kestas Lukoskinas, has said: “The main thing is we have nothing to hide in our hands.”In Vilnius, even former communist blocks are painted in soft pastels. Elsewhere, meandering cobbled streets offer up cafes and pretty boutiques.Still, the heart and backbone of Vilnius is creative, a scene both historic and constantly reinvented. On Literatų gatvė (Literature Street) in Vilnius Old Town, individual wall plaques celebrate writers associated with the city, including Adam Mickiewicz, who lived on the street, Joseph Brodsky and Romain Gary.View image in fullscreenSocialising in Vilnius’s historic centre.Photograph: Sergio Delle Vedove/AlamyTheLithuanian National Opera and Ballet Theatre, where tickets start at a very reasonable £15, is matched as a cultural attraction byLukiškės Prison 2.0– a Soviet jail shut in 2019 and now reinvented as a creative space, with cells turned into studios and stages hosting trendy bands such as Aurora and Fontaines DC. AtMo Museum, a modern Lithuanian art gallery established by scientists and philanthropists Danguolė and Viktoras Butkus – and one of the first large-scale private collections of its kind since independence – the current exhibition,GamePlay, explores the creative impact of video games.Celebrating an everlasting twilight: midsummer, Lithuanian styleRead moreAlthough I try classic Lithuanian cuisine –cepelinai(stodgy potato dumplings filled with ground meat), and pink soup (borscht with kefir) – I’m excited to find a burgeoning Michelin restaurant scene. AtErtlio Namas, a nine-course tasting menu is an affordable €70, with traditional dishes reinterpreted with modern spin: salted ide fish with jelly, bread soup with beer-braised beef, and buckwheatbabkacome as delicious exquisite morsels.Vilnius repeats Soviet motifs now familiar on my journey: brutalist architecture; cool young people in all black and boots; and the compulsory revampedTV tower, where you can climb to the 67th floor and take a horrifyingly scary walk on a handrail-free ledge, attached only by a rope.The journey home feels faster; the west softer, even though the train is delayed by five hours (so much for German efficiency). I wander Amsterdam hazily, the harsh and uniform brutalism replaced by the uniquely elegant canal houses and oily Van Goghs – yet I’m surprised, among the clatter and chaos, to miss the calm, clean order of the eastern European cities.

No more will I slosh wine I’d sooner thin my nail polish with into casseroles and stews (another reason I’m not the cook in my house, I suppose).What does wine add to a dish besides its practical use for deglazing? I asked a few gastronomic authorities how best to use the stuff in my cooking, and it turns out it’s an excellent way to use up leftover wine that may otherwise turn into vinegar.First, what you start with is crucial. The wine shouldn’t be faulty in any way, not least because, while you can burn off the alcohol, you won’t be able to eradicate any further sins, unless you want the unmistakable wet dog aroma of corked wine permeating your meal. Yeugh.The base principles of what wine to use mirror those of general food pairing: red wine with red meat, white with white meat and fish. Beaujolais for a beef casserole, sauvignon for chicken pot pie. But you can take things a step farther and incorporate wine into the ingredients themselves. Chef-patron of Jikoni andGuardian columnist Ravinder Bhogaluses it to make a compound butter. “I never waste dregs,” she says. “I like to reduce a large glass of leftover wine with a chopped shallot by about two-thirds, then fold it into 250g softened butter, which I then roll into a log of greaseproof paper and keep in the fridge.” And why be bound by the whims of fridge-door wine? You can also stash that in the freezer: simply pour into ice cube trays and use within a couple months.“I love poaching fruit with wine to go into desserts,” says Adriann Ramirez, head of pastry atFinksin north London. “It works best with delicate fruit, and what wine you use really matters. Red wine pairs well with figs, rosé with the stone fruits and white with pears. Poach on a low heat so you get to keep some of that booziness in the dessert.”That’s certainly a cut above regular water and sugar. I particularly love using pedro ximénez to poach pears. Sometimes I even put it in the food.Four wines to put in your cookingThe Long Road Viognier£18.50 Tesco, 13.5%. Adds a fruit-forward roundness to casseroles.

Another good idea, which came to me as I pulled a new packet from the back of the dresser and ignored the flutter of tiny wings, was to make more than enough polenta and pour the extra into a Pyrex dish while it was still hot, so it could set into a block to be cut into slices and grilled the next day.I’ve written about polenta before; how the word is ancient and generic – referring to any mushy dish made from cereal flour and water – and how, after its arrival in Europe in the 1600s, it became synonymous with ground maize. There exists a world of different grades and milling, but, broadly speaking, when you buy ground maize (cornmeal) for polenta, you will have two options: finely ground (which might also be white) for a soft, thin polenta, and coarsely ground, which will have glassy-looking grains and makes an excellent body scrub and a harder, tastier polenta. The latter also takes much longer to cook, anything from 40 minutes to several hours, depending on who (or which packet) you consult, although in my experience an hour is almost always enough, and anything beyond that is more a way of deepening the flavour. Stirring is also a matter of opinion, with some saying it must be constant, while others (hello, Anna Del Conte!) noting that after 10 minutes, if the heat is low enough, you can in fact leave the pan to attend to other things, coming back every now and then to give it a strong, hard stir.So, having stirred my polenta intermittently until it looked like a supermoon crossed with a boiling mud pool, I added butter and served most of it with fried mushrooms and slices of melty taleggio. We also had another glass of wine and I forgot the earlier good idea, meaning that several hours later I didn’t come back to a neatly set block of polenta, but a pan with a deep yellow crust. Not being the first time, I do have a solution for this oversight: ignore the pan until the morning, then lever out the bits and fry them with eggs. Another option also involves waiting until the morning and then, using your hands, digging and gouging out the yellow remnants, weighing them, and squashing them with more butter, dried fruit and nuts.Be warned: these patties remain delicate until they cool, so leave them on the tray until they are sturdy enough to move on to a rack. They are best described as a biscuit crossed with a flapjack crossed with a bread pudding, and it is a good idea to have them with a hot drink. The correct idea would be coffee with a shot of grappa.Leftover polenta biscuitsMakesAbout 15400gleftover cold polenta100g room temperature butter, diced180g soft brown sugar100g raisins100gprunes, dried fig or apricots, snipped into bits100g chopped nuts1 tsp nutmeg1 tsp cinnamonOptional handful dry polenta or plain flourHands are best for this. Working in a bowl, break the polenta into bits, then add the butter and squeeze it into the polenta – it will look lumpy, but don’t worry. Add the remaining ingredients apart from the dry polenta or flour, and squeeze again. The mixture will be quite soft, but not so much that it can’t be shaped; if it is very sloppy, add a little dry polenta or flour.Line an oven tray with baking paper. Break off small, plum-sized lumps of the mixture (making about 15 in all) and form them first into balls and then into small patties about 5cm across x 5mm thick. Arrange the biscuits on the tray, and press the tops flat with the back of a fork.Bake at 150C (130C fan)/300F/gas 2 for 45 minutes, or until slightly golden. The biscuits will remain soft and delicate until they cool, so leave them on the tray until they are cool enough to move on to a rack.Explore more on these topicsFoodA kitchen in RomeItalian food and drinkBiscuitsBakingFruitHerbs and spicesrecipesShareReuse this content"

The writer Andrew Jefford described him as “the father of the contemporary English wine scene” – a significant feat for anyone, let alone a man who taught himself winemaking from a paperback, and whose self-planted vineyard totalled six acres.Breaky Bottom Vineyard, near Lewes, in East Sussex, was Peter’s passion. For five decades he worked meticulously on it: tending the vines by hand, labelling each bottle and taking the maligned Seyval Blanc variety from punchline to prizewinner.Peter was born at Rangeworthy Court, his family’s country home inGloucestershire, and grew up in Notting Hill, London, together with his brothers Rémy and Patrick. His mother, Jeannine Mercier, was an artist, and his father, John Inglis Hall, an author.As a child Peter planned to join the Navy, but changed his mind on discovering that ships were no longer built of wood. He attended St George’s college in Weybridge, Surrey, and briefly worked with the lions at Longleat, Wiltshire, before going on to study agriculture at Newcastle University from 1963 to 1965.View image in fullscreenPeter Hall in 1974, the year he first planted the vineyardWhile subsequently working at Northease farm inEast Sussexhe discovered the nearby valley of Breaky Bottom, which had lain uninhabited for decades. It was love at first sight. He married Diana Robinson, the daughter of the landowner, Harris Robinson, in 1969, and the couple took up the tenancy.Breaky Bottom began as a livestock farm, but in 1974 Peter and Diana planted their first vines, and soon he was primarily a winemaker. The early years were fraught with the threat of bankruptcy, but Peter carried on. By 1993 he was a well-respected maker of still wines, winning his first gold at the InternationalWineChallenge that year. Two years later he bought the land that his vineyard stood upon.In 1995 Peter released his first sparkling wine: the Millennium Cuvée Maman Mercier, named after his mother. Future wines would all bear the names of friends and relations.As a maker of sparkling wine Peter began to reach new heights. Breaky Bottom was recognised with numerous awards, and became a favourite of both royalty and government. In 2025 he received the Diploma of Honour from the Fédération Internationale des Confréries Bachiques, the first time it had been awarded to an English winemaker.Peter and Diana later divorced and in 1998 he married Christine Lowe. He is survived by her, and by Kate, Emily, Tom and Toby, the four children from his first marriage, and five grandchildren.Explore more on these topicsWineOther livesEast SussexFarmingRural affairsFoodobituariesShareReuse this content"

The resulting product is not only rare, but very expensive – costing about £130 for 500g.It is also controversial, with animal welfare experts raisingconcernsthat some producers keep civetsin battery-style conditions.Researchers say they have uncovered new clues as to the coffee’s unusual taste, revealing unroasted beans retrieved from civet poo have differences in their fat content to those from ripe coffee berries manually collected from trees.“We believe that the way it is fermented in [the] gut make[s] the profile different,” said Dr Palatty Allesh Sinu, a co-author of the study from the Central University of Kerala, India. “The enzymes and microbiome involved in fermentation [in the civet] [are] different from [the] manual fermentation process.”Writing in the journal Scientific Reports, Sinu and colleagues reported how, in January 2025, they collected beans both from wild civet scat as well as trees across five estates in Karnataka, India, that were cultivatingrobustacoffee.The team then prepared and ground both groups of beans – although they did not roast them – before analysing them.“When roasted, several heat-sensitive oils and esters can be degraded or changed their profile,” said Sinu.While the team noted that someprevious studieshad found kopi luwak has a lower protein and caffeine content compared with traditional coffee – results experts have suggested isdown to the beanspassing through the civet’s gastrointestinal tract – no significant differences in protein or caffeine levels were found between the two groups of beans analysed in the new study.However, the beans from civet poo did have a higher fat content, as well as higher levels of two fatty acid methyl esters – substances based on the building blocks of fats.The team say the results could help explain the taste of kopi luwak.“Fat and oils are essential ingredients of flavoured materials,” said Sinu, noting many volatile organic compounds – substances that help to givearoma and flavour – use fat as a medium or carrier.Ramit Mitra, the first author of the study, said the two fatty acid-based substances were commonly used in the food industry as flavouring agents and were likely to impart a dairy-like flavour.“Hence, we cannot rule out the possibility of these two compounds contributing to the taste profile,” he said.The researchers note there are other important factors that affect the flavour of coffee.“The core taste of coffee develops mainly from roasting and the chemical alterations that occur during that process. Our study focuses on examining the raw form,” said Mitra.Dr Simon Maher, an associate professor in sensors and analytical instrumentation at the University of Liverpool, who was not involved in the work, said the study suggested the civet’s digestion tweaked the beans’ chemical profile.“The civet-processed beans showed subtle differences, with higher fat content and more of certain fatty acids that might influence flavour, albeit the study was based on small samples of unroasted beans,” he said.“Further research is needed to confirm how much of this survives roasting and shows up in sensory tests,” he added.Explore more on these topicsCoffeeBiologyFoodChemistryFood sciencenewsShareReuse this content"
