Streets were closed and platforms were built for dancers and musicians to play for that fleeting second that the cars went past.Modi had visited the UK for an overnight stay at Chequers this summer. Had the same happened for him, the equivalent would have been thousands of billboards with the Indian premier’s face adorning the M40. What he got – according to aides – was a souvenir gingerbread.Starmer flew into India to mark one of the standout successes of his first year in government, the clinching ofthe trade deal with India that had eluded his Tory predecessors.He met Modi at the G20 this time last year in Rio de Janeiro where he told the Indian prime minister that the talks should either be stepped up or the two sides should conclude it was never going to happen.View image in fullscreenThe Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, and his UK counterpart, Keir Starmer, walk in the gardens of Raj Bhavan, in Mumbai, India, on Thursday.Photograph: Stefan Rousseau/ReutersThey agreed to try to push through – though the subsequent press release which said talks would be restarted was ignored by most of the travelling media who were used to false starts, having been promised multiple times a “deal by Diwali” by Boris Johnson as multiple festivals went by.Starmer lit a Diwali candle at a vibrant celebration at Mumbai’s most exclusive hotel during his trip to mark the signing of an free trade agreement underLabour– which would have been hard for his old PMQs sparring partner to see.Foreign Office officials said Starmer had seemed to have managed to crack Modi’s tough and serious exterior to forge a decent relationship that has eluded many world leaders, and on Thursday he called Starmer his “friend” during a press conference.However, the UK has been able to take some advantage of the frustrations the Indians feel, having poured resources into a now unpredictable relationship with the US.“My understanding is PM Modi said to the Maharashtra government, please make sure that the prime minister understands how welcome he is in India,” one official said. “It is absolutely extraordinary. I’m used to quite a level of welcome in Delhi for foreign leaders but I’ve never seen anything like this.”There is another parallel universe onboard Stamer’s flight to Mumbai, on which was the biggest business delegation since Theresa May’s 2018 trip to China: more than 120 chief executives, founders and cultural leaders, as well as vice-chancellors.Starmer – who often gives off the aura of the boss attempting to rally his employees with a company picnic – addressed the business leaders of companies like EY, Barclays and British Airways, telling them to each give him one deal they had clinched during the trip, as if he was doing their appraisals.In the hotel bars, business leaders said they were excited about the level of access they were being given in India and the level of goodwill that had been unlocked towards UK businesses.“That’s the headline on day one,” one said. But then comes day two. And after the warm words about the deal, what most business leaders wanted to know chatting to ministers and journalists in the hotel lobby was what to expect from the forthcoming budget. At the forefront of their minds is the quest for growth back home.On the mind of many CEOs who flew out with Starmer to India is the state of the British economy, national insurance rises, more tax rises in the budget, the possibility of bank taxes, rocketing energy bills and stubborn inflation.The India FTA is a teaspoon’s-worth to fill Rachel Reeves’s budget hole of an estimated £30-40bn. The government’s own modelling of the impact of the India trade deal says it will add 0.13% to GDP by 2040 – and likely a fair bit less by 2030, which is the forecast period when the OBR assesses the meeting of the fiscal rules.New low tariffs have not yet even been implemented – that will come after parliament ratifies the deal, which officials cannot even yet put a timeline on. University vice-chancellors accompanying the prime minister are diversifying into campuses in India – but really would like the prime minister to be more liberal on international students, a far bigger income driver.And Starmer will fly back home from personal billboards to some of the lowest poll ratings in prime ministerial history and restive cabinet and backbenches. Several had been anxious over the Labour conference abouta prime minister who had begun a fight for the soul of the nation with Nigel Farageand then flown abroad.

What about the Saudi regime?Jonathan LiewThe tawdry event was an ultimately doomed attempt by the Saudi government to buy the kind of authentic grassroots culture it is unwilling to countenanceThu 9 Oct 2025 11.33 EDTLast modified on Thu 9 Oct 2025 14.04 EDTShare“Istand up for your right to be religious. But please know that you’re wrong … you’re living in a fantasy land, and after you die nothing happens, stop being a fucking child.” The words of Jim Jefferies there, the riotous Australian-American comedian whose work delights in smashing taboos, offending and outraging, saying the unsayable. Sex, politics, religion, faeces: nothing is beyond the pale. And as such, there was a good deal of expectation over his headline set at the inaugural Riyadh comedy festival in Saudi Arabia, which came to an end on 9 October. What sacred cows would he slay? Who would feel the wrath of his cold, veiny truth?Alas, Jefferies appeared to have been disinvited from theRiyadh comedy festivalafter comments he made on a recent podcast about the murder of Jamal Khashoggi. Even though the gist of said comments was that he wasn’t too fussed about the killing either way. “Unfortunate, but not a fucking hill that I’m going to die on,” were his exact words. To no avail. Cancelled again, this time by one of the richest regimes on Earth. These days, you can’t even describe the extrajudicial murder of a journalist in an embassy as unfortunate. What kind of woke hellscape are we creating for our children?Happily, many more discreet comedians have managed to pass the government vetting process.Jimmy Carr,Louis CK, Jack Whitehall, Omid Djalili, Kevin Hart, Dave Chappelle, Pete Davidson: they tried to make them go to Riyadh, and they all said yes, yes, yes. The lineup, predictably, is overwhelmingly male. Some of the appearance fees have reportedly run to seven figures. And of course what the Saudis are getting for their money is not simply words but silence, not simply performancebut moderation. Welcome to comedy in the age of the autocrats: a procession of paid court jesters who know exactly who is writing their cheques.“The royals loved the show,” the US comic Bill Burr reflected on his experience. And frankly we can only applaud the bravery of a comedian prepared to unleash his edgiest material on an unprimed audience. The “gay gym” routine, for example, in which Burr so eloquently encapsulates the quandary of a straight man working out in a gym full of gay men, afraid to make eye contact in case one of them gets the wrong idea. Making fun of gay people? In Saudi Arabia of all places? What a brave, brave boy.We can assume, similarly, that Chappelle’s cache of material poking fun at trans people went down like a US-made F-15 Eagle over a Houthi-controlled area of Yemen duringthe Saudi-Iran proxy war. And yet, understandably, there were areas where even these brave messengers of truth feared to tread. A leaked contract issued to performers outlined topics that would be deemed unacceptable to the hosts. Jokes about Saudi Arabia itself were strictly off-limits: its royals, its legal system, its government. Any religious material was a no-go. Presumably, too, the country’s human rights record.Which feels slightly incongruous, given the fact that so many of the festival’s performers pride themselves as advocates of free speech. Carr, for example, has called himself “a free speech absolutist”, which is certainly a very noble way of describing what he does for a living. Chappelle has long railed against a cultural consensus that prevents him from telling the jokes he really wants to tell while – confusingly – also allowing him to tell those very same jokes to packed arena audiences every year.But of course it is not hard to divine the true motivations of the new Saudi court jesters. By and large, these performers are established, household-name comedians, already financially secure and simply leveraging their reputation in pursuit of another lucrative payday. A few of them have even been helpfully explicit in this regard. As Davidson explained: “I see the number, and I go: ‘I’ll go’.” The more interesting side of the equation is what the Saudis think they are getting out of it.Because the point that has been overlooked in much of the accompanying commentary is that Saudi Arabia boasts its own rich and active comedy scene, albeit one that rarely lives on the lit stage. Some of the better-known Saudi comics – Amy Roko, Hisham Fageeh, Bader Saleh – are stars of YouTube and TikTok. Naturally they operate within strict constraints, confine themselves to culturally appropriate material. Saudi humour also lives in late-night cafes, in WhatsApp groups and voice notes, on the less regulated corners of the internet and shielded by multiple layers of irony and deniability. Sometimes, this leads to mortal danger: in June a Saudi journalist called Turki al-Jasserwas executedfor allegedly running a satirical X account critical of the regime.The Russian literary theorist Mikhail Bakhtin deployed the term “carnivalisation” to describe the disarming characteristic of laughter: its ability to dissolve conventions, social norms and traditional hierarchies of power. Comedy derives from the revelation of challenging established truth, and in so doing exposing its vulnerability, its dissonance from reality. But what exposure is realistically possible at a festival organised by state decree, where tickets cost up to £200, where performers are given five-star treatment and given a list of proscribed topics?In a way, Riyadh’s investment in comedy can be seen as an ambitious but ultimately doomed attempt by the Saudi government to buy the kind of authentic grassroots culture it is unable to produce for itself. Doomed because ultimately the very materials that produce good comedy – irreverence, human ingenuity, artistic freedom, intellectual courage, a sense of common shared values – are anathema to the dictatorship. This is in essence the equivalent of the Abu Dhabi Louvre, the Qatar World Cup, thegold-plated Oval Office. You can buy comedians, but you can’t buy a sense of humour.Writing in the Guardian, Djalilidefended his participationon the basis that it was “about sharing laughter … a chance for cultural exchange as a force for social transformation”. But how much of this laughter truly escapes the walls of the theatre, beyond the brightly lit plazas of Boulevard City, into the degradation and exploitation beyond? What kind of social transformation is possible when only a privileged few are in on the joke?The American comedian Sinbad once famously observed that “comedians are funnier when they’re riding the bus”. And perhaps bothSaudi Arabiaand its hired entertainers are labouring under a kind of convenient delusion. The naivety of the Saudi government in imagining that comedy can whitewash its many crimes is matched only by the naivety of the comedians, some of whom genuinely believe their presence is a kind of cultural bridge, a force for positive change.Of course artcanchange minds – change worlds – but only if the will to do so truly exists. Or, as a world-renowned standup comedian almost put it: I stand up for your right to do standup comedy in a medieval autocracy. But please know that you’re wrong. You’re living in a fantasy land, and after you leave nothing happens. So, you know.

Minutes later, the US president went on Truth Social, his social media platform, to thank both men by name.While Trump has played down his chances to win the prize, he has been active behind the scenes,phoning Jens Stoltenberg, Norway’s finance minister, in Oslo this summer to tell him he wanted to discuss the “Nobel peace prize … and tariffs”. He regularly brings up the award; usually as he makes the tenuous claim to have ended six or seven wars since his return to the White House.“If I were named Obama, I would have had the Nobel prize given to me in 10 seconds,” Trump said last year during the presidential race.The obsession has become a running joke among foreign diplomats seeking to lobby their interests, including at a regular breakfast among European ambassadors where a common topic is how to keep Trump engaged in the support ofUkraine.“Anytime he is talking aboutsolving seven wars, he is really sending a message: give me the Nobel,” said one senior European diplomat based in Washington.The Nobel peace prize was believed to be a key motivator in his recent efforts to broker a ceasefire in Ukraine, influencing a rare summit withVladimir Putinin Alaska that was seen as a major gamble if it was interpreted as appeasing the Kremlin.Ultimately, Putin was unmoved and Trump appeared to lose interest in ending Russia’s war in Ukraine.“Once he figured out that was too hard, we’re back to Gaza,” the diplomat said.Trump’s new push for a peace deal to end the war kicked into gear during last month’s UN general assembly, where he met with Arab leaders and then approved a 20-point peace plan that he announced during a White House summit withBenjamin Netanyahuin late September.The timeline for the award has played an active role in trying to reach a deal this week, as officials have regularly said they believed a peace deal would be ready by Friday – the same day as the Nobel committee announces its choice.Doron Hadar, a former negotiator, told the Washington Post on Thursday that the “Friday morning deadline is shaping the timeline, the announcement of the Nobel Committee in Oslo.“Everyone understands this timeline, and that’s why I believe that by [Thursday] evening, there will already be a declaration that the sides have reached agreements,” he said, according to the outlet.Need I list all the reasons why Trump shouldn’t get a Nobel peace prize? | Sidney BlumenthalRead moreIn a delicious bit of irony, the Norwegian committee told Agence-France Presse that it had held its final meeting on Monday – two days before Trump announced the first phase of the peace deal on Truth Social.But amid the naked ambition behind Trump’s push for peace in Gaza, even those who have been highly critical of the war have hailed the deal as a major achievement.“This is definitely a morning for celebration,” wrote Gershon Baskin, an Israeli peace activist and hostage negotiator. “The war is ending. The killing and destruction will stop.”Later, he added: “In conclusion of these first thoughts: President Trump deserves the Nobel peace prize.”Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpNobel peace prizeForeign policyNorwayIsrael-Gaza warUkraineRussiaanalysisShareReuse this content"

It was an influence on my life, as was Blazing Saddles. We’re big fans of Mel Brooks. The Zucker brothers are legends – they were pioneers in the parody game. I was definitely influenced by Airplane! but I think our humour was different. We didn’t change the wheel, but we put a rim on the tyre.

Minutes later he was woken up by a doping control officer at his front door: “I’m dying in my bed and somehow I hear the guy come. Barely. I’m dead and he’s coming,” says Monfils, laughing.One of the requirements of being an elite player is providing your location for an hour each day as part of the anti-doping whereabouts system, which allows the anti-doping authorities to conduct unannounced out-of-competition doping tests. For years the Frenchman, like most other players, has assigned 6am as his usual hour, a time he is certain to be at home or in his hotel room.‘You want a player to die?’ Heat is on tennis after players wilt in extreme conditionsRead moreOn this occasion an exhausted Monfils opted for an unorthodox solution: “I say: ‘Bro, there’s no chance I [can] pee. I know you have to be with me. Come to my room.’“I put down a chair. He was there and I said: ‘Sorry, I’m going to sleep. I don’t know when I’m going to wake up, but you can have a vision on me. It’s not that I don’t want to pee. I’ll be honest – I’ve been out. I peed like five minutes ago. I can’t.’”It turned out to be a far longer nap than Monfils had anticipated: “I woke up at 3pm, the guy was scrolling his phone. [I say] ‘Hey, bro.’ I pee. So he was waiting for me for 10 hours. He could steal everything in my house.”Along with training, fitness, matches and the relentless challenge of travelling to tournaments around the world, being a professional means navigating the World Anti-Doping Agency’s strict regulations, to which all athletes in Olympic sports must adhere. No matter how long it takes, every player must provide a urine or blood sample when called upon.Once a player is selected for a test, the doping control officer must stay with the athlete and watch them at all times. That often means hosting a complete stranger in their home. Tallon Griekspoor, the Dutch No 1, recalls a time when a doping control officer spent three hours on his sofa: “We were rewatching an Ajax match for 90 minutes.”Athletes can also be approached outside their chosen time, a source of irritation for some. If a doping control officer calls and they are in the vicinity of the location they provided the player is obliged to immediately return to the location. Last year, the talented Czech 19-year-old Jakub Mensik had to leave his high school graduation to go back home for a test. It took him three hours to produce a sample.Taylor Fritz was once intercepted by a doping control officer in his Shanghai hotel lobby as he arrived from a long flight: “The guy was in my room and I was taking naps for 10 minutes at a time because I was so jetlagged and so tired. I kept on waking myself up every 10 minutes to see if I could pee because I couldn’t.”View image in fullscreenTaylor Fritz had to make an official wait when he was too tired and jetlagged to provide a sample.Photograph: Alex Plavevski/EPAThe doping control officer is also required to watch athletes closely as they deposit their sample. The Frenchman Arthur Fils stresses the unusual nature of such encounters: “One stranger who is looking at you when you are peeing is pretty tough,” he says, laughing. “So every time it’s a weird situation.”For Jack Draper, this has led to some particularly awkward experiences: “It’s a difficult moment, right? Sometimes you push so hard that you’re farting and you’re right next to them.”Despite the unusual nature of these interactions, Andrey Rublev notes that players get used to them. Often seeing the same faces helps: “Sometimes if the guy is maybe a rookie or I have never seen him before, he will be a bit like a principal: ‘Now, put your pants down to your knees.’ I say, ‘Man, what’s the difference if it’s to the knees or not?’ He says, ‘No, these are the rules. Everybody has to follow.’“Sometimes I face those guys, but it was maybe one or two times in my life. The rest, they are respectful, they are OK. They are there, they are watching, but they’re not trying to make you crazy.”Draper often reminds himself that these encounters are less than ideal for all involved: “It’s a tough job for them. I always keep that in mind. Some people get annoyed because it is a very intimate situation. But I feel for that person. It’s their job.”In the final weeks of the 2016 season, Madison Keys was chasing a spot in the WTA Finals. Hours after her semi-final loss in Beijing, Keys had already secured a last-minute wildcard into the Linz Open: “We ran to the hotel, packed and got on a plane two hours later and I forgot to update my whereabouts [to say] that I wasn’t going to be in Beijing – I was going to be on a plane. They came the next morning. I remember landing in Linz and immediately sobbing, like: ‘Oh no, I have a strike.’ It’s so stressful.”Many players cite managing their whereabouts information as one of their biggest causes of stress, particularly in a sport that requires so much travelling and last-minute itinerary changes. However, it is a significant part of their job. Like many others, the British No 2, Cameron Norrie, works with his agent to manage his whereabouts: “We have a group chat and we screenshot [the app] every night, or he sends it, and we know exactly where it is going to be every night.”Jessica Pegula, however, refuses to let anyone else handle her whereabouts: “I do it by myself. I just would never want someone else doing that because if they messed up, I’d be livid.”View image in fullscreenJessica Pegula prefers to take sole responsibility for her whereabouts.Photograph: VCG/Getty ImagesIncurring one strike is far from unusual. During a recent period off the tour due to injury, Bianca Andreescu extended her trip in Thailand by one day, but forgot to change her whereabouts information. The next day she received a call from an official at her front door in Monaco.Pegula says: “I know there’s a lot of girls that maybe messed up a couple dates and [were] on their second or third strike and they’re like, ‘That was the worst year of my life. I didn’t sleep. I was just laying in bed.’ You’re making sure the doorbell works. Every single phone is on. It can be very stressful.”As with most other sports, numerous tennis players have been banned for whereabouts failures after missing three tests within 12 months. Recent examples include Mikael Ymer and Jenson Brooksby receiving 18-month suspensions in 2023. Brooksby’s ban was lifted early in 2024.Keys thinks missing tests is far easier than most people believe. “It’s stressful, it’s hard,” she says. “I understand why it needs to be done, but it’s funny how it seems like a really simple thing, but to actually account for an hour, 365 days a year, every single year, you make mistakes.”Fritz concurs: “It’s important that we have fair sport and people are able to get tested at random times. But the one thing I will say is people shouldn’t underestimate how just … shit happens.”Explore more on these topicsTennisDrugs in sportfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Here’s how the experts ramp up the flavour while dialling down the chaosSarah PhillipsThu 9 Oct 2025 08.21 EDTLast modified on Thu 9 Oct 2025 08.23 EDTShareOne of the great joys in life is enjoying good food with friends. It can taste all the better if you have cooked it yourself, but this isn’t something that comes naturally to everyone. What are the best tricks to pull off a meal – whether it’s for two or 20? Here, chefs share the simplest ways to wow at a dinner party.Don’t try too hard“Rather than trying to impress people, it is actually the opposite that ultimately does impress,” says Rosie Kellett, who hosts supper clubs in London and is the author ofIn for Dinner.“My advice is keep it really simple. Cook something that you know you’re going to nail and feeds the right amount of people. Go for the heavy-hitters that are solid gold in your repertoire.”Make a base meal that caters for everyone“Say you’ve got two or three different dietaries [dietary restrictions] within your party,” says Kellett. “Make a base meal that everybody can eat and then have optional additions.”She gives the example of making a vegan dal with rice that happens to be gluten-free, with sides of sambal and marinated roast chicken, because “if my dad was at the table, he would be like, ‘Where’s the meat?’ That is optional, but the base meal is delicious, plentiful and doesn’t make the people with dietaries feel like they’ve been excluded. It also makes things way simpler for you.”Be organisedView image in fullscreenPlan properly to avoid a last-minute run to the shops.Photograph: SeventyFour Images/AlamyJimmy Lee, who is chef proprietor ofLychee Orientalin Glasgow, has been throwing dinner parties since he was 14. He stresses the need to be crystal-clear about the ingredients required, to avoid the realisation that you have forgotten something at the last minute.While prepping for a dinner party, Lee recalls “making glutinous rice balls with a cashew nut filling. I forgot I needed butter for it, so I had to run out in the middle of the night to Tesco.”Lee is known for his60-second recipes, but even these need meticulous planning, he says.Some chefs, like Kellett, make a schedule: “I’m neurotic. I write a play-by-play of what I’m going to cook, when I’m going to cook it. In an ideal world, everything has been cooked before anyone arrives,” she says.Go for things that are “great at room temperature, or could be bubbling away while people are arriving, and then you have just got one little salad, salsa or dip to pull together, which you could probably hold a conversation while doing”.Be sure to set the table before guests arrive: “If the host is flapping around and has got their head in the oven and hasn’t set the table, then it can create a chaotic vibe,” says Kellett.Stock up on basics“Even though I know what I’m doing in the kitchen, I’m always doing it with very little time,” says Thomasina Miers,Guardian columnist, co-founder of Wahaca and author of several cookbooks including the recently publishedMexican Table. “For me, feeding my friends is about hacks and shortcuts while also making sure they are going to eat the most delicious food possible.”Miers says she “squirrels away stuff that will be useful … If I have a great sourdough that is going stale, I will blitz it and then freeze the crumbs. If I’m at my local farmers’ market, I’ll always buy a smoked cod’s roe, because I know I could then make a starter in 10 minutes. I always have a kilner jar full of French dressing: I make it once a month.”This all helps “on the day that you come back from work and realise you’ve got 12 people for dinner”, Miers says.Don’t choose recipes with too many ingredientsView image in fullscreenCurries and stews can be a ‘cost-effective way of feeding a lot of people’, says chef Rosie Kellett.Photograph: Nina Firsova/AlamyUsing pantry ingredients can avoid dinners getting too costly, says Kellett. “If you’re cooking for a very large group, then making a massive batch of a curry or stew is a cost-effective way of feeding a lot of people, and it’s still mindblowingly delicious.” She made tinned mackerel pasta for a supper club in Los Angeles “and it went down a treat”.Another hack is frozen fruit, says Kellett: “It is so cheap in comparison to fresh fruit. If I wanted to use raspberries in the middle of winter, I’d buy frozen and defrost them.”Go for seasonal ingredients“Try to cook recipes that focus on what is in season,” says Kellett. “It is generally cheaper. It’s also a no-brainer, because all the ingredients in season right now are going to taste better. If you’re in the UK and you decide to make a panzanella salad in the middle of October, your tomatoes are going to be watery and expensive.”Practice makes perfectWhen Lee appeared on the Great British Menu, “I made the main course at least 50 times before I went on the show.” That is an extreme example, he concedes, but he says it is integral to test a recipe before serving it.Dinner parties are back: but smaller, more casual – and with TwigletsRead moreLast week, Lee cooked dinner for some VIPs: “I made haggis spring rolls, using haggis from a craft butcher. I did a taste test a week before and it was wonderful. You wouldn’t want to serve a dish that you haven’t tested.”The bigger the group, the simpler it should beFor groups of six and over, Kellett advises making one dish: “If it’s lots of people, the effort is in making the bulk of the food.”When it is a smaller group, you can be more elaborate: “The other night I had a couple of friends over and I roasted a chicken, I made my own mayo, I did a green salad and made chicken-fat potatoes. There was pudding. I went a bit more all-out, because there were fewer people, so it felt less intimidating and less daunting.”New York-based Jake Cohen loves a dinner party: his latest book is calledDinner Party Animal: Recipes to Make Every Day A Celebration. Despite having done a lot of entertaining as research for the book, even he still feels the need to dial it in sometimes.“I take the best NYC bagels, I make a homemade tomato sauce and get some mozzarella, and we bake it and it’s delicious. It’s as high-end as the pizza bagel can get but it’s still pretty casual, and everyone loves it.”Don’t be afraid to ask guests for help“Quite often, someone will say, ‘What can I do?’ And then they’ll be chopping herbs, making cocktails or spreading toast. I think that’s fun and makes people feel included,” says Miers.But when it comes to dishing up, it can be best for the chef to present it the way they intended: “I’m quite controlling about food, so if I want everyone to experience the meal I’ve cooked in a certain way, then I probably will serve it for them,” says Kellett.Stun with simple startersView image in fullscreenKeep the starter simple with a fresh salad or dips.Photograph: Brent Hofacker/Alamy“I always have chicken livers in my freezer,” says Miers, “because I can make a chicken liver paté in very little time, which is cheap, delicious and people always go absolutely wild for it.”Miers loves a salad starter with seasonal ingredients such as leaves or roasted pumpkin, toasted nuts and seeds, oil, possibly some blue cheese and a dressing, which is “very luxurious, colourful and fresh, and pretty easy to assemble when your friends are there”.She also recommends a white bean dip: “Confit garlic the week before, then blitz it through with white beans and lemon zest, and make a charred jalapeño oil to drizzle on top. The combination is delicious.”Master foolproof mainsMiers recommendsThai pad kra prow, “a beef or venison mince salad with bird’s eye chilli, lime and fish sauce. It is easy and affordable. Serve with rice and maybe some wok-fried pak choi.”She also suggests wowing a table with a whole fish: “It takes 20 minutes to cook from start to finish. It’s way easier than pan frying eight filets.”Marinade it in something like a pipián: “Toast pine nuts and pumpkin seeds, blitz them in an upright blender with tarragon and parsley and mint, add a touch of allspice and cinnamon, char some onions and garlic, and the sauce you get out of that is absolutely incredible.”“I have a recipe which is aconfit tomato and chickpea stew,” says Kellett. “You throw all the ingredients into an ovenproof pan with a lid – you don’t chop anything – and then you put it in the oven for three hours. When it comes out, it’s been transformed into the most silky, delicious stew of all time. It’s got so much flavour.” Serve with couscous, rice or a salad with a tahini drizzle, she suggests.“Cook a normal dish, but think outside the box a bit and add your own flavour or twist,” says Lee. “For example, make a beef and black bean sauce, then add a wee bit of whisky, so you’ve elevated it.”Choose crowd-pleaser puddingsView image in fullscreenMake a simple, well-loved pudding – or pick one up from the supermarket.Photograph: Nelea Reazanteva/Getty Images/iStockphoto“Sticky toffee pudding is an absolute backbone of winter cooking,” says Kellett. “I have a version of it, which has prunes rather than dates in the sponge and a lot of ground and candied ginger. If you want to be slightly more adventurous, a pavlova is a really good way to go. The meringue can be made up to a week in advance and kept in an airtight container. And then all you have to do on the day is whip cream and add fruit. Another one is tiramisu. I recommend making it 24 hours in advance and refrigerating to get the right texture. It always wows.”“Puddings can be very simple,” says Miers. “You could buy some good quality vanilla ice-cream and make your own hot chocolate sauce, which you then pour mescal all over.”Miers also likes to make quince jam, “because it’s pretty easy to make and it means I can do a cheeseboard instead of pudding. It is a very easy way of adding a special touch.”“It is all about the pud,” says Cohen, who confesses to having a major sweet tooth. “If you have the time to do it all, do it all. And if you don’t – outsource the pudding.”Seat guests wisely“If there is a quieter, more reserved person,” says Kellett, “I’ll make sure they are sitting next to someone who is quite chatty who can carry it a bit. If there are people who I’ve always wanted to meet but haven’t met yet, I’ll put them near each other.”Sit guests “next to someone they don’t have anything in common with – they might have a more interesting conversation”, she says.Carefully curate a playlist“Think of the music as a guest,” says Cohen. “I’ve been told by friends that Brat [by Charli xcx] is not appropriate to play at a dinner party. Sometimes it is and I lean into that.”If you want a more sedate vibe, Cohen recommends Jessie Ware, Regina Spektor or Sara Bareilles to “make people’s sympathetic nervous systems calm down. You’re trying to get people to let their guard down.Foodis a part of that, but the ambience is as well.”RelaxView image in fullscreenDon’t forget the ‘party’ in ‘dinner party’.Photograph: Westend61 GmbH/AlamyIt is easier said than done, but “If you’re relaxed and having fun, then your friends will be too,” says Miers. “Above all, people just want to have a drink, some nice music and have fun. If you’ve got delicious food, that’s an added bonus.”Know that almost everything can be rescuedIf it all goes horribly wrong, “You can salvage most things,” says Cohen. Even the most seasoned chefs “have moments where it’s like, ‘OK, I really messed this up – do I have a box of pasta in the pantry?’ and throw together acacio e pepe”. If all else fails, he says: “Order a pizza.”Explore more on these topicsFoodThe expertsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Many expressed the fear that the new deal would collapse, bringing more suffering to the devastated territory. Though crowds gathered in some places to dance and sing, in many places witnesses reported muted reaction amid loud overflights by warplanes and drones.InIsrael, on a day of fast-moving and sometimes chaotic developments, hospitals readied to receive hostages to be released by Hamas, the ruling coalition government signed off on the new ceasefire deal and thousands took to the streets of Tel Aviv to express joy and relief.Late on Thursday evening, a statement from the government said it had “just approved the framework for the release of all the hostages – both the living and the deceased”.Donald Trump’s announcement of his“peace proposal”last week triggered a frantic round of indirect negotiations between Hamas and Israel in the Egyptian Red Sea resort of Sharm-el Sheikh.The US president said on Thursday he would try to go to Egypt for the signing of the new deal. In Israel, officials suggested that the US president was expected to visit there on Sunday.Trump added that 48 hostages held byHamas, of whom less than half are thought to be still alive, would be released on “Monday or Tuesday” and said that the deal had “ended the war in Gaza”.2:46Netanyahu thanks Trump, Kushner and Witkoff after Israel approves hostage release deal – videoIt was announced on Thursday night that the US wouldsend about 200 troops to Israelto help support and monitor Gaza ceasefire deal.World leaders scrambled to welcome the breakthrough, even if most of Trump’s broader “peace proposal” has yet to be negotiated or even explicitly acknowledged by Hamas and Israel. The US president told reporters in the Oval Office that nobody would be forced to leave Gaza under the terms of the deal. “No, it’s just the opposite,” he said. “This is a great plan.”There was some confusion during Thursday on the timing of the first phase of the deal – reflecting the general uncertainty about many of its main principles.The office of Israel’s prime minister,Benjamin Netanyahu, said the ceasefire would take effect once the agreement was ratified by his government. But an Israeli government spokesperson said the ceasefire would go into force within 24 hours of the cabinet meeting. Those hostages believed to still be alive inGazawould then be freed within 72 hours, they said.Israel’s forces would withdraw to an agreed line in the Gaza Strip that would leave them in control of 53% of the territory, a spokesperson for the Israeli government said.In exchange, Israel will free about 2,000 Palestinian prisoners, but the spokesperson said Marwan Barghouti, a senior figure in Mahmoud Abbas’s Fatah movement who is hugely popular in the West Bank and Gaza and has frequently been talked of as a future leader, would not be among them. Hamas sources said the list of released prisoners was still being discussed late on Thursday.Hamas called on Trump and guarantor states to ensure Israel fully implemented the ceasefire.The exiled Gaza chief Khalil Al-Hayya said on Thursday the group has received guarantees from the United States, Arab mediators and Turkey that the war on Gaza has permanently ended, according to Reuters.UN agencies said they were ready to rush aid into Gaza, where afamine was declared by experts in August.António Guterres, the UN secretary-general, said “to turn this ceasefire into real progress, we need more than the silencing of the guns”.Guterres called for safe access for humanitarian workers, the removal of bureaucratic obstacles to swift delivery of aid, the rebuilding of Gaza’s shattered infrastructure and funding to meet the immense needs.View image in fullscreenA man and a woman embrace in Tel Aviv.Photograph: Maya Levin/AFP/Getty ImagesIn Israel, thousands of people filled a square in Tel Aviv that has become a focus of the campaign to bring home the hostages. Many sang and danced as they waved Israeli and American flags.“It feels like we can finally see a bit of light at the end of the tunnel we have all been walking through,” said Einav Kahila, a 25-year-old student who travelled from Jerusalem. “There’s a lot of anxiety, also, because we’re always feeling unsure or insecure about the situation. But the people that came here today chose to be on the side of optimism.”Einav Zaugauker rejoiced at the prospect of freedom for her son Matan, one of the last hostages.“I can’t breathe, I can’t breathe, I can’t explain what I’m feeling … it’s crazy,” she said.In Gaza, Ola Al-Nazli, 47, said she had learned of the ceasefire from her neighbours in al-Muwasi, a crowded and squalid coastal strip where hundreds of thousands of Palestinians displaced by successive Israeli offensives have sought shelter.“I did not know how to feel, whether to be happy or sad. We have experienced this many times before, and each time we were disappointed again, so this time fear and caution are stronger than ever,” said al Nazli, who was forced to leave her home in Gaza City by the recent Israeli offensive there.“Everyone lives in tents that do not protect from the cold or from the bombing. Those who had money or work lost everything. That is why our happiness is incomplete, mixed with pain … I only hope that we can live in safety, not hear the sound of bombs again, not be forced to move from one place to another, and that the crossings [into Gaza from Israel] will open soon.”Successful completion of the deal would mark the biggest foreign policy achievement so far for Trump, who took office in January promising to quickly end the wars in Gaza and Ukraine, only to be confronted with obstacles and complexities he had apparently not foreseen.Senior envoys from the US, Qatar and Turkey had joined the talks in the Egyptian Red Sea resort of Sharm-el-Sheikh this week, apparently adding momentum to discussions launched on Monday. Trump sent his son-in-law Jared Kushner and the special envoy Steve Witkoff. Both were reported to have arrived in Israel on Thursday night.Map of Gaza Strip highlighting Israeli troop withdrawalsNegotiators have closed gaps between Hamas and Israel over the details of the first phase of the 20-pointplan announced by Trump, but it is unclear whether the parties had even discussed thornier questions, such as how Hamas will be disarmed, as Israel has demanded, and the eventual governance of Gaza.Senior Hamas official Osama Hamdan on Thursday told Qatar-based broadcaster Al Araby the Palestinian militant group rejects Trump’s proposal for an interim “Board of Peace” to oversee Gaza’s administration, headed by the US president himself.Though huge challenges remain, the agreement nonetheless brings the two sides closer than any previous effort to halt a war that evolved into a regional conflict, drawing in countries such as Iran, Yemen and Lebanon, and reshaping the Middle East.In recent days, Israel reduced the intensity of its military campaign. Gaza medical authorities reported eight people were killed in Israeli strikes on Wednesday. Even if aid surges in, through the UN and the Red Crescent as specified under Trump’s plan, hundreds of thousands will stillnot have enough foodor shelter.About 1,200, mostly civilians, were killed in the Hamas attacks of October 2023 and 251 taken hostage. Israel’s retaliatory offensive has killed more than 67,000, mostly civilians, and reduced much of Gaza to rubble.Agence France-Presse, the Associated Press and Reuters contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warPalestineHamasIsraelMiddle East and north AfricaDonald TrumpBenjamin NetanyahunewsShareReuse this content"

Except whenDonald Trumpis involved, in which case there is only one parent.Nevertheless, many countries and individuals have a right to step forward to claim an authorial role in the deal that it is hoped will bring an end to the two-year war inGaza.But it is a sign of the collective nature of the effort of the past few months that so many can credibly claim a role, including the US president, who after many false starts was finally persuaded to focus, end the fantasy of driving tens of thousands of Palestinians from their homeland and instead spell out toBenjamin Netanyahuthe versions of victory the Israeli prime minister could and could not have.The turning point was a meeting in New York on the sidelines of the UN general assembly chaired by Trump, soon after his baroque speech to the gathering. Trump described the sidelines chat as his most important meeting at the UN. In the encounter organised by theUnited Arab Emirates, he set out for the first time his then 20-point plan for peace in front of a group of Arab and Muslim states that could form the backbone of any stabilisation force that entered Gaza in the event of a ceasefire.By then Trump, with the help of his son-in-law Jared Kushner and the former British prime minister Tony Blair, had been convinced to change his mind on two critical issues. First, Palestinians should not be driven from Gaza andIsraelshould not rule the territory. “Gaza should be for Gazans,” one said.That meant Trump dropping the displacement rhetoric he deployed earlier in the year, when he triggered widespread alarm by speaking of plans todevelop a “Gaza Riviera”.View image in fullscreenPalestinians celebrate in Khan Younis after Donald Trump announced Israel and Hamas had agreed on the first phase of a Gaza ceasefire.Photograph: Ramadan Abed/ReutersSecondly, Trump was persuaded a “day after” plan for the future of Gaza would not complicate the negotiations on a ceasefire-hostage release agreement by adding new contested ingredients, but was the precondition for success. A UK diplomat explained Blair’s thinking: “Hamas was not going to give up unless it knew the Israelis were going to get out and the Israelis were not going to get out and stop occupying Gaza unless they knew Hamas were not going to be in government. Unless you resolved the question of who governs Gaza you cannot bring the thing to an end.”That in turn made it easier for the Arab states to put political pressure on Hamas to negotiate since they could point to a route towards Palestinian statehood, something that has always been their precondition for reconciliation with Israel. The Arab states had also put their names to demands that Hamas stand aside and disarm.One of those involved in persuading the US president said: “People don’t want to hear this but the advantage of Trump is that once he decides to do something he is like a juggernaut. And he really did put pressure on the Israelis.”Trump’s mood towards Israel was clouded by Netanyahu’s unilateral decision tobomb Dohaon 9 September in the hope of wiping out Hamas negotiators. Trump had not been consulted, but the US assurances were met with scepticism. As a result Netanyahu, not a man prone to contrition, was ordered to apologise and say he would respect Qatar’s sovereignty in future.View image in fullscreenSmoke billowing in Doha after Israel carried out airstrikes there last month.Photograph: Jacqueline Penney/AFPTV/AFP/Getty ImagesTo repair relations fully withQatar, the host of main US airbase in the Middle East, Trump issued an extraordinary executive order saying any future attack on the emirate would be treated as an attack on the US. All this meant the US leader was better disposed to the Gulf states’ vision of a new Middle East. In a sign he was prepared to push the Israeli government hard, in a way Joe Biden had not, Trump told Israel there would be no further annexations in the West Bank.From the very start of the sidelines meeting at the UN in September, the aim of the Arab states was to bind Trump personally into the process. Qatar’s emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, said: “We count on you and your leadership … to end this war and to help the people of Gaza.” He said Israel’s real objective was “to destroy Gaza, to render housing, livelihoods, education, and medical care impossible, stripping away the very foundations of human life”.The concept that Trump personally was central to a solution – indeed its guarantor – flattered the US president who offered himself up as the chair of the peace board, the body that would oversee the reconstruction of Gaza.In one sense, he would be just a name plate, but to the extent he has a hinterland, it is construction. That means there is a possibility he will remain engaged, for the moment at least.Those observing him said Trump began to feel he had a serious opportunity to solve a conflict he variously said had lasted 3,000 or 600 years, in contrast to his failed attempt in Ukraine. The prospect of winning the Nobel peace prize, Trump’s obsession, hovered once more into view.View image in fullscreenPeople celebrate after a peace deal is announced at hostages square in Tel Aviv, Israel, on Thursday.Photograph: Abir Sultan/EPAThat meant that once his plan was published Trump did not let go, but kept the pressure up on Hamas, warning of the group’s annihilation if it did not release the hostages in return for 250 Palestinians. But neither did Trump let Israel backtrack. Speed and momentum became of the essence.It was the seniority of the negotiators who went to the talks in Egypt that revealed the stars were finally aligning and Hamas would be forced into releasing all the hostages it held, even though Israel would not immediately leave all of Gaza. The scenes were extraordinary enough in that the Hamas negotiators were – albeit through mediators – holding talks with a government that had tried to assassinate them a month earlier. By the time they started the participants sensed a deal was unavoidable.The arrival of Kushner, the head of the intelligence office of the Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, İbrahim Kalın, and the prime minister of Qatar, Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, confirmed a breakthrough was imminent.During the talks, Hamas negotiators led by its leader Khalil al-Hayya, Mohammad al-Hindi, the deputy secretary general of Islamic Jihad, and Jamil Mezher, the deputy secretary general of the Popular Front for the Liberation ofPalestine, sought to clarify the names of the Palestinians to be released, the mechanism of the release of the Israeli hostages and the “day after” aspects of the agreement, poring over the maps showing a withdrawal of Israel’s forces.A map of Gaza showing details of the initial area of the IDF withdrawBut Hamas was told while the critical “day after” principles stood, the details would have to wait for a second linked negotiation. The risk for Hamas now is that it loses its leverage upon handing over the hostages – and that fears Israel will then refuse to engage with the plans for Gaza’s future or find a pretext to restart the fighting will be realised. The domestic brake on Netanyahu resuming the fighting – the demand to save the hostages – would have gone.Here Trump’s continued willingness to keep up the pressure on Netanyahu was critical, and is acknowledged by Hamas in its statements referring to the US president as guarantor of the plan. On Fox News, Trump said he had told Netanyahu that “Israel cannot fight the world”, adding: “And he understands that very well.” He said: “You will see people coexisting and Gaza will be rebuilt.”By contrast Amit Segal, a journalist close to Netanyahu, said: “There’s no phase two. That’s clear to everyone, right? Phase two might happen someday, but it’s unrelated to what’s just been signed.”Many elements of Trump’s 20-point plan are being addressed by diplomats from the US, Europe and Arab states at a separate gathering in Paris on Wednesday.View image in fullscreenTrump’s willingness to keep up the pressure on Benjamin Netanyahu was critical.Photograph: Andrew Caballero-Reynolds/AFP/Getty ImagesOn the agenda are issues such as the Hamas handover of weapons; its exclusion from future administrations; the mandate of an international peacekeeping force; the delivery of resumed aid flows; and the future relationship between Gaza and the West Bank as the nucleus of a future Palestinian state. On almost all these, there have been deep differences between Israel on the one hand, and Europe and the Arab states on the other.But in a promising sign, US officials will attend this meeting, suggesting Washington does not favour an armed status quo.At the centre of these discussions is Blair, who is to sit on the peace board or interim government that will oversee the Palestinian technocrats that help implement reconstruction plans. Blair will have to convince the Palestinian Authority that he is not offering a colonial-esque arrangement, as the former prime minister says it fears. But he is unlikely to do the job unless he has real powers, something he feels was not given when he was Middle East special envoy to the quartet.Arab leaders are seeking assurances that the international stabilisation force that eventually enters Gaza has a UN security council mandate, and that there is a clear plan to treat Gaza and the West Bank as one political entity.1:10Marco Rubio passes Trump handwritten note on Gaza peace plan – videoOne of the most difficult issues unresolved in the rushed talks in Egypt is the timing of the Hamas weapons handover. The group may be willing to deliver its arms to an Arab-run authority, or a Palestinian civil police force, but not to Israel. Some diplomats even believe Hamas may feel the need to take a new political course, something it has been close to doing before. “Gazans are going to demand to know what the past two years were about,” one diplomat said.One diplomat involved in the talks said: “The tragedy is that this could have all been agreed 20 months ago, all the elements were there. The key Israeli objective – which is why it is a tragedy this war has gone on so long – was the removal of Hamas from future rule, and that was obtainable a long time ago.”Explore more on these topicsGazaDonald TrumpIsraelQatarUnited Arab EmiratesUS foreign policyPalestinefeaturesShareReuse this content"

These are the tears I prayed for,” said one mother of an Israeli hostage detained in Gaza, as reported by Haaretz.Some of those gathered in the city’s hostage square said Trump should be recognised for his role in brokering the deal, calling for a “Nobel prize to Trump” as they gathered in the early hours of the morning to celebrate.Emily Damari, a British-Israeli who was held captive by Hamas for more than a year before being released in January, posted a video to her Instagram celebrating the news with friends who included fellow former hostage Romi Gonen.The group could be seen hugging each other and dancing around a room as they toasted “L’chaim”, meaning “to life”.As part of the agreement, Hamas said it would release the 20 hostages still alive as early as this weekend, with sources saying an exchange with Palestinian prisoners would happen within 72 hours of the deal being signed, which is expected to be Thursday.View image in fullscreenEinav Zangauker, the mother of hostage Matan Zangauker, reacts to the announcement.Photograph: Ronen Zvulun/ReutersDescribing the deal as a “great day of Israel”, the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said: “With God’s help, we will bring them all home.”Hamas took 251 people hostage into Gaza in 2023, where 47 remain, including 25 the Israeli military says are dead.“The entire nation is waiting and excited,” said the Israeli defence minister Israel Katz in a post on X. “I extend a big hug to the families of the hostages for the expected return home of their loved ones, including IDF soldiers and fallen soldiers.”Netanyahu said he would convene the government on Thursday to approve the Gaza ceasefire agreement, while Hamas called on Trump and guarantor states to ensure Israel fully implements it.Sparked by the 7 October attack on Israel that killed about 1,200 people, many of them civilians, Israel’s retaliatory military campaign has been devastating, killing more than 67,000 people, including many children, as aid blockades have resulted instarvation and acute hunger.The war has razed Palestinian territory and unleashed a major humanitarian crisis.Eyad Amawi, a Palestinian aid coordinator displaced in central Gaza, said he was still comprehending news of the ceasefire agreement.“We believe and don’t believe. We have mixed feelings, between happiness and sadness, memories, everything is mixed,” he said.Amawi said he hoped the deal was implemented as agreed so that people could return to their homes and begin to “renew the [will] and the hope for life” in Gaza where many children are injured and rubble is everywhere.His biggest fear, he said, was Israel creating obstacles to implementing the agreement.“We need to fix everything here, especially the psychological effects to [continue] with our lives.”Even as initial celebrations unfolded, details of the agreement remained unclear on Thursday, including whether the parties in Egypt had made any progress on thornier questions about the future of the conflict, such as whether Hamas will demilitarise, as Trump has demanded, and how the war-torn territory will be governed in future.If it is implemented, the deal would bring the two sides closer than any previous effort to halting a war that has evolved into a regional conflict, drawing in countries such as Iran, Yemen and Lebanon, and reshaping the Middle East.Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warGazaPalestineUS foreign policyDonald TrumpMiddle East and north AfricafeaturesShareReuse this content"

The news of theimminent ceasefirehad spread rapidly across the devastated territory during the night, with a few gunshots fired into the sky in celebration, but as morning came the mood was of tense anticipation.“Everyone is still afraid,” said a 26-year-old woman in al-Mawasi, the squalid, overcrowded coastal strip where much of the population has sought shelter in makeshift tents and plastic shacks.Nearby, Abbas Hassouna, 64, said he and his family were “waiting for an official announcement and real guarantees for opening the crossings, bringing in food, and stopping the killing, destruction and displacement”.“When we see these things happen, only then will we truly believe them. But for now, fear remains. They could backtrack at any moment or break the agreement as before and we will remain in the same endless cycle with nothing changing except more suffering,” said Hassouna, who is from northernGazabut has been displaced several times.Ola al-Nazli, 47, said she had learned of the ceasefire from her neighbours in al-Mawasi. “I did not know how to feel, whether to be happy or sad. We have experienced this many times before, and each time we were disappointed again, so this time fear and caution are stronger than ever,” said Nazli, who was forced to leave her home in Gaza City bythe recent Israeli offensive there.“Everyone lives in tents that do not protect from the cold or from the bombing. Those who had money or work lost everything. That is why our happiness is mixed with pain and fear. I only hope that we can live in safety, not hear the sound of bombs again, not be forced to move from one place to another, and that the crossings will open soon,” said Nazli.Aid agencies said they were preparing to “flood” Gaza with food and other essential supplies.The 20-point plan proposed by Donald Trumpprovides for a surge of humanitarian assistance. The World Health Organization chief, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said his agency was prepared to “scale up its work to meet the dire health needs of patients across Gaza, and to support rehabilitation of the destroyed health system”.View image in fullscreenUnrwa said it had enough food stockpiled to provide for Gaza’s population for three months.Photograph: Ramadan Abed/ReutersThe UN agency for Palestinian refugees, Unrwa, welcomed the deal as a “huge relief”, and said it had enough food stockpiled outside Gaza to provide for the devastated territory’s 2.3m population for the coming three months. Though more aid has reached Gaza in recent weeks, quantities are still grossly insufficient, humanitarian workers said.Jihad al-Hilu heard the news of the ceasefire on a radio while sitting in his tent in al-Mawasi. “At that moment, I felt a mix of joy and relief, as if some hope had returned to my heart after a long wait. We were longing for this moment, for the blood to stop and for the massacres that have broken so many homes to end,” Hilu, 33, told the Guardian.“At the same time, there is a great fear that lives within us. We worry that this truce might be temporary and that the war could return as it did before.”There are also widespread concerns about what peace may bring to Gaza, where more than 90% of homes have been damaged or destroyed, almost all infrastructure destroyed and where much of the population goes hungry every day. More than 67,000 Palestinians, mostly civilians, have been killed by the Israeli offensive launched in the aftermath of the Hamas raid in October 2023, which killed 1,200, also mostly civilians, and saw 251 taken hostage by militants.“What worries me more than anything is the lack of security. Hunger can be endured, but the absence of safety is the real disaster. I fear that Gaza could turn into a place of chaos ruled by gangs and militias instead of law and order,” Hilu said.Witnesses said Israeli forces fired tank shells to prevent Palestinians returning to northern parts of Gaza on Thursday morning but reported no sounds of fighting or airstrikes.Nadra Hamadeh, whose sister, brother-in-law, two nieces and son in law were killed in the war, said she hoped to return from al-Mawasi to northern Gaza as soon as possible to check on her home, which she believes to be damaged but not destroyed.“My heart is heavy for those who lost their families and children and homes … As for us, we look forward to returning to our home that we had to leave behind. It feels still as if our souls were taken from our bodies when we left,” Hamadeh, 57, said.“Our hope is that the war ends, Gaza will be rebuilt with its people and residents, and families will be reunited … I only ask that the people return to their homes as they were before this two-year war and that Gaza recovers and is returned to its people.”Explore more on these topicsGazaPalestineIsrael-Gaza warMiddle East and north AfricaIsraelnewsShareReuse this content"

A UN human rights report has deemed that Israel’s actions in Gazaconstitute a genocide.The survivors have endured prolonged famine as a result of a deliberate Israeli policy of cutting off food supplies, and the Israel Defense Forces have made much of the Gaza Strip uninhabitable.

Through her photographs, Enas Tantesh has recorded what those crude numbers mean in intimate terms – what it looks like when your home and community are pulverised.Before the war started, with a deadly Hamas attack on Israel on 7 October 2023, Tantesh had never considered being a photographer. She was finishing high school and following in the footsteps of her father, a locally celebrated and widely beloved swimming instructor, and had started to teach children in her home town of Beit Lahiya.However, as the Israeli bombardment took its toll and increasing numbers of Gaza’s journalists either fled or were killed, her older sisterMalakbegan writing for the Guardian and other European newspapers. Around the same time, in the spring of 2024, Enas started taking photographs of the turmoil and devastation around her, equipped only with a Samsung mobile phone and a few tips from her father.Her pictures taken over the next 18 months show an entire people reduced to nomads and scavengers on their own land.View image in fullscreenChildren look for drinking water in Beit Hanoun, 3 February 2025Nine out of 10 people of Gaza have been forced to leave their homes because of bombardment or Israeli evacuation orders. Like almost every other Palestinian family, the Tanteshes have had to pack everything they could carry, travel across Gaza to cram into a relative’s home, and then move again when that home came under fire, and then do so yet again.The family have had to move 11 times, and in common with most people in Gaza they have ended up living in tents improvised out of bits of wood, cloth and plastic sheeting.A cat sits in the rubble of a home in Beit Lahiya, 10 February 2025Tantesh’s photos capture the impermanence, despair and constant insecurity of day-to-day life for a traumatised populace trudging through a ruined urban landscape. Following the direction of her eyes is a reminder that survival is not just about finding shelter and water and scraping just enough to eat. It is also about seeking out moments of normality and human connection whenever possible: eating with the family, children playing, or one of Gaza’s cats somehow retaining its elegance, immaculately groomed and aloof amid all the wreckage.View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenClockwise from top left: Enas’s uncle tends to the plants around his tent in Rafah, 29 April 2024; Enas’s sister, Malak A Tantesh; fruit from the surviving orange trees on the family farm in Beit Lahiya, 31 January 2025; crops around the family’s tent in Khan Younis, 10 December 2024; Enas’s father hugs the tree he planted before the war began, in Beit Lahiya, 31 January 2025Tantesh has faced suspicion and abuse while going about her work. Passersby sometimes wish death upon her, assuming she is one of an increasing number of people who shares images of other people’s suffering online, without context or permission, to fuel their personal fundraising efforts.She was once detained by Hamas while on the street working. She was questioned about her motives and credentials but was freed after a brief interrogation.In the course of the war, Tantesh has developed a thick skin and a steady nerve. On one assignment, she photographed a man being operated on for a stomach wound that had become infected in one of Gaza’s semi-wrecked hospitals. She was allowed into the cramped operating theatre on condition she would help pass surgical implements and swabs while the patient’s abdomen was opened up.View image in fullscreenA patient undergoes surgery in Deir al-Balah, 29 September 2024When a beachside cafe was shelled a block away from the temporary family home in Gaza City, Tantesh recorded the aftermath, taking pictures of what remained of its customers, too graphic to be published.Like all Palestinians in Gaza, Tantesh has become inured to death. “It has become routine,” she said. “People see something terrible and just keep walking.”Evidence has grown that Israel is targeting journalists in Gaza: 248 have been killed so far. Tantesh has learned to live with fear and how to mitigate risk, always keeping one eye on the sky for killer drones.View image in fullscreenA girl looks out of her tent in Khan Younis, 23 May 2024The most dangerous place she had worked, she said, was at Gaza port, where Israeli patrol boats would regularly strafe the shore with machine-gun fire.In the apartment where the family stayed in Gaza City, one room facing the sea had a bullet hole in the wall. Tantesh’s father would bar his children from going in there when there was shooting, but she would often tiptoe to take photos from its vantage point over the beach.Earlier in the year, the family returned to Beit Lahiya in the north and Tantesh’s pictures recorded the bitter homecoming. She and her sister tried to find their family house amid the ruins but finally had to be guided there by a neighbour because each flattened street looked like the next.View image in fullscreenThe sun sets over the destruction of Beit Lahiya, 3 February 2025She and her sister climbed one of the few multistorey structures still standing, braving Israeli snipers to get a view of the desolation.“Those photographs of my own home were the hardest I ever had to take,” Tantesh said.Reporting by Julian BorgerExplore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza: two years onGazaPalestineIsrael-Gaza warMiddle East and north AfricaWar reportingIsraelnewsShareReuse this content"

Officers said their investigation remained open and urged anyone with further information to come forward.Westwood has been charged with 15 offences relating to seven women: four counts of rape, nine counts of indecent assault and two counts of sexual assault. The alleged offences include the rape of a female aged between 17 and 18 in London between 1995 and 96, as well as sexual assault of the same girl in central London in a similar period.He has also been charged with the rape and sexual assault of a female aged between 17 and 18 in London between 2000 and 2002, and the rape of a woman in her 20s in London in 2010.Other charges include indecent assault of a 17-year-old girl in Fulham, London, in 1983; sexual assault of a woman in her 20s in Vauxhall, London, in 1986; and sexual assault of a woman in her 20s in Stroud in 2010.The most recent alleged offence was sexual assault of a woman in her 20s in Finchley, north London, in 2016.In 2022 the Guardian and BBC News published accounts of 18 women who accused the former DJ of sexual misconduct and predatory behaviour, alleged to have happened between 1992 and 2017. In response to historical sexual abuse allegations, Westwood has previously said he “strongly denies all allegations of inappropriate behaviour”.Westwood stepped down from his show on Capital Xtra in April 2022 and left Radio 1 and Radio 1Xtra in 2013 after nearly 20 years.Det Supt Andy Furphy, of the Metropolitan police, said: “It takes courage to come forward and report allegations of this nature. The women who have done so have put their trust in us and we continue to provide them with all available support.“Our investigation remains open and we’d encourage anyone who has been impacted by this case, or anyone with information, to come forward and speak with us. Any reports will be dealt with in the strictest confidence by specialist officers.”Lionel Idan, the chief crown prosecutor, said: “Our prosecutors have established that there is sufficient evidence to bring the case to trial and that it is in the public interest to pursue criminal proceedings.“The Crown Prosecution Service reminds everyone that criminal proceedings are active, and the defendant has the right to a fair trial. It is extremely important that there be no reporting, commentary or sharing of information online which could in any way prejudice these proceedings.”Westwood is due to appear at Westminster magistrates court next month.Explore more on these topicsUK newsEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

The arrest came within 24 hours of the man being released from custody, where he had been held since the attack at Heaton Park synagogue on Yom Kippur last Thursday.In a statement, Counter Terrorism Policing North West said it did not believe there was any continuing threat to the public after last week’s incident, which led to the deaths of two worshippers.Jihad Al-Shamie, a Syrian-born UK citizen, was shot dead by police after ramming his car into congregants before attacking others with a knife while wearing a fake suicide belt.Shamie, 35, called 999 and pledged allegiance to the extremist group Islamic State while attempting to storm the synagogue, shouting: “This is what you’re going to get for killing our children.”Melvin Cravitz, a 66-year-old father of three, was killed along with Adrian Daulby, 53, who is believed to have been inadvertently shot by police as he ran to block the synagogue doors to stop Shamie getting inside.Three men and a woman were initially arrested by counter-terror police last week on suspicion of the commission, preparation and instigation of acts of terrorism. All four were released on Wednesday night.However, police said one of those men was then rearrested at 12.34pm on Thursday at Manchester airport on suspicion of failing to disclose information to officers.The man was held under section 38B of the Terrorism Act 2000, which makes it an offence to withhold information that could prevent a terrorist act or that could lead to a prosecution under terror laws. He had since been released on conditional bail, police said.Explore more on these topicsUK newsnewsShareReuse this content"

In more than half of the cases reviewed, unsupervised overnight contact was ordered.“No child should be forced to spend time with an abusive parent or caregiver if the circumstances aren’t safe for them to do so,” Jacobs said. “But time and time again we see how the pro-contact culture and antiquated views on domestic abuse are contributing to decisions that put children in harm’s way.“It’s clear that domestic abuse can no longer be considered a side issue within the family justice system, but instead its everyday business that demands a rigorous response.”Academics from Loughborough University examined 298 files from three courts and observed nearly 100 court hearings. As well as discovering evidence of abuse in case files, the team also heard claims of abuse in 73% of observed hearings, the report said.Survivors repeatedly described how they were dissuaded from raising allegations of domestic abuse due to the suggestion that it would have “no impact” on whether the abusive parent would be granted contact. Others said they felt that pressure had been put on them to accept potentially unsafe child arrangement orders out of fear that, if they contested, an even worse outcome would be granted.Jacobs said survivors were being forced to navigate the complex system without representation. She urged the Ministry of Justice to commit to a rollout of the multi-service Pathfinder courts to resolve problems between parents sooner, and place more emphasis on hearing children’s voices.“The government must also provide the necessary investment to extend the pilot study, conducted by my office, to allow for rigorous oversight on the changes being made and ensure accountability from within the family court,” she added. “Tinkering around the edges will no longer suffice.”The report highlights how outdated views on domestic abuse among some legal professionals saw physical violence taken more seriously, while coercive and controlling behaviour – which often underpins physical abuse and is an offence in itself – was frequently dismissed.Areport by Women’s Aidthis summer detailed how 19 children had been killed over nine years by adults who had been allowed contact with them despite a history of violence.In March, MPs discussed the presumption of parental involvement, and heard from Claire Throssell, whose two sons, Jack and Paul, weremurdered by their abusive fatherin during court-ordered unsupervised contact.On Tuesday Catherine Roper, the chief constable of Wiltshire police, apologised after a staff member’s failure to properly undertake applications under Clare’s law – which allows people to find out whether a partner has a history of violence or domestic abuse – left women at risk of violence, including one who was the victim of attempted murder.Explore more on these topicsDomestic violenceViolence against women and girlsChildrennewsShareReuse this content"

US attorneys do not typically present to a grand jury.“This is nothing more than a continuation of the president’s desperate weaponization of our justice system. He is forcing federal law enforcement agencies to do his bidding, all because I did my job as the New York state attorney general,” James said in arecorded video statementon Thursday.“These charges are baseless, and the president’s own public statements make clear that his only goal is political retribution at any cost. The president’s actions are a grave violation of our constitutional order and have drawn sharp criticism from members of both parties.”Halligan was installed in the role last month afterDonald Trumpbecame frustrated with the pace of investigations against his rivals. “No one is above the law,” Halligan said in a statement. “The charges as alleged in this case represent intentional, criminal acts and tremendous breaches of the public’s trust. The facts and the law in this case are clear, and we will continue following them to ensure that justice is served.”The US president has made little secret of his desire to use the justice department to punish his rivals. “What about Comey, Adam ‘Shifty’ Schiff, Leticia??? They’re all guilty as hell, but nothing is going to be done,” he said in a September post on Truth Social that was addressed to Pam Bondi, the US attorney general. “We can’t delay any longer, it’s killing our reputation and credibility.”The move is Trump’s latest effort to weaponize the Department of Justice to punish political rivals. It comes two weeks after Halligan secured charges against James Comey, the former FBI director. Career prosecutors prepared a memo in that case outliningwhy chargeswere not warranted. Comeypleaded not guiltyon Wednesday.The facts of the charges were not immediately clear. A grand juryempaneled earlier this yearhad been investigating allegations that James may have committed fraud when she helped her niece buy a home in Virginia.On a document that was part of that transaction, there was a box checked indicating James intended to use it as her primary residence, which would make better mortgage rates available. But in otherdocumentsandemailswith her mortgage broker, James clearly indicated she did not intend to use the home as her primary residence.A career prosecutor in the eastern district of Virginia, Elizabeth Yusi,had determinedtherewas not probable causeto file mortgage fraud charges against James and had been preparing to present her thinking to Halligan.James attracted Trump’s ire after she led a civil fraud case against the president and his business that resulted in a $500m fine. The fine wasrecently overturnedby an appellate court.There has been considerable turmoil in the US attorneys office for the eastern district of Virginia in recent weeks.Erik Siebert, Halligan’s predecessor, was removed from his post for failing to bring charges against Comey and James.Maya Song, one of his top deputies, was also fired. A third prosecutor, Michael Ben’Ary, who was not involved in the Comey case, was also fired after being targeted by Trump allies online.William Pulte, the head of the Federal Housing Finance Agency and a staunch Trump ally, has made criminal referrals on mortgage issues against several Trump rivals, including James, the California senator Schiff, and the Federal Reserve governor Lisa Cook.Explore more on these topicsLetitia JamesVirginiaLaw (US)Trump administrationnewsShareReuse this content"

They are telling them to be ashamed of their country. They are telling little Johnny, who’s eight, who is black, that he is a victim and little Oliver, who is white, who is eight, that he is an oppressor. They are dividing us, not uniting us. They are feeding this negative culture in.”In response to Farage’s claims, Daniel Kebede, the general secretary of the National Education Union, said the idea the education system was controlled by Marxists was “nonsense”. He pointed out any strikes have to be on the grounds of terms and conditions for teachers, and questioned whether Reform would attack these immediately when entering government.“Farage has made his political career out of dog-whistle politics and now, like Trump, he is lining up teachers and their unions for a fight,” Kebede said.“I think that’s grossly irresponsible. I don’t – and nor does my union, and nor does the teaching profession – push critical race theory as he’s suggesting … Should he become prime minister he would sell out our public services, including education … and he would be a disaster for education and children.”Reform, which is leading the polls by about 10 points, has not set out much detail on a proposed education policy and does not appear to have appointed an education spokesperson.However, Farage’s remarks at the Hillsdale College event suggested the party would overhaul the system and the curriculum. He said: “We have got a massive job to do with education – absolutely herculean. And, by the way, we can’t do it in six months or a year; it will take us years, years to turn this around.”He said gen Z was more open to critical thinking, but millennials were “absolutely hopeless”.Paying tribute to Charlie Kirk, the rightwing activist who conducted debates on US college campuses and who wasmurdered last month, Farage said: “All I want education to do is teach critical thinking – to teach people there are two points of view and you make up your own mind as opposed to what’s happening now and, in too many cases, saying one is virtuous and one is evil. It’s a massive job in both Britain and America.”Reform has previously clashed with the NEU, the UK’s largest teaching union, after Kebede called the party“far right and racist” and dismissed Farage as “a poundshop Donald Trump”.Farage has accused Kebede of being a “a self-declared Marxist … someone who is absolutely determined that our children should be poisoned at school, their minds should be poisoned about everything to do with this country” and has argued the union is trying to indoctrinate teenagers against Reform.Almost one million people work in schools in the UK, about half of whom are teachers with the others teaching assistants and support staff. The NEU has about 450,000 members.National strikes over teacher pay and conditions in 2023 caused widespread disruption in schools and millions of days of lost learning for children.At the US event, the Reform leader also pledged to help spread the online educational material of Hillsdale College in the UK. He said organisations like Hillsdale were “part of the fightback”, adding that: “I mean this. I will help Hillsdale in the United Kingdom garner hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of young people to your online courses. I make that commitment tonight to you here in this very hall and I’ll do that.”Hillsdale, a small private Christian college, offers free courses. Its website says: “A scientific, literary, theological, political, and moral education is necessary for personal happiness and to perpetuate the blessings of civil and religious liberty. Hillsdale College furnishes these beautiful courses for free to all who wish to learn and to enjoy those blessings.”Reform did not reply to a request for comment.Explore more on these topicsNigel FarageReform UKSchoolsTeachingnewsShareReuse this content"

Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko said nine people had been injured, with five of them taken to hospital. He said power cuts and disruptions to the water supply had hit districts on the east bank of the Dnipro River that runs through the city. “The capital of the country is under an enemy ballistic missile attack and a massive attack by the enemy strike drones,” the Ukrainian air force said, urging Kyiv residents to remain in shelters.Twenty-three Ukrainian children and adolescents have been brought out of Russian-occupied areas of the countryto territory under Kyiv’s control, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s chief of staff said on Thursday. Andriy Yermak, writing on the Telegram messaging app, said the rescue was carried out under the president’s “Bring Kids Back UA” programme aimed at bringing to safe areas children deported to Russia or confined to Russian-occupied areas of Ukraine.US President Donald Trump said Thursday that Washington and Nato allies were “stepping up the pressure” to end the war in Ukraine, after his outreach to Russia’s Vladimir Putin failed to achieve a ceasefire. “Yeah, we are stepping up the pressure,” Trump said in an Oval Office during a meeting with Finnish President Alexander Stubb. “We’re stepping it up together. We’re all stepping it up. Nato has been great,” he added. Trump said his administration might impose more sanctions on Russia.Russia accused Ukraine on Thursday of rupturing a now defunct pipeline used to transport Russian ammoniainto Ukraine for export, releasing toxic gas into the air. The incident took place near the frontline village of Rusin Yar in Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk region, Russia said.The UN’s nuclear watchdog said on Thursday the process had started to restore external power to the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plantin southeastern Ukraine, cut off from the electricity grid for more than two weeks. Rafael Grossi, director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, said the process had begun after consultation with authorities in Ukraine and Russia, who blame each other for the downing of the external lines.Strikes on Russian oil facilities by Ukraine’s newly developed long-range missiles and drones are causing significant gas shortages in Russia, while on the battlefield a recent Ukrainian counteroffensive has derailed Russia’s plans to capture parts of the eastern Donetsk region, Zelenskyy said.Ukraine’s new Palianytsia missile has hit dozens of Russian military depots, he said. The Ruta missile drone, meanwhile, recently struck a Russian offshore oil platform more than 150 miles (250km) away in what Zelenskyy called “a major success” for the new weapon.Zelenskyy floated the idea of nominating the US president, Donald Trump, for the Nobel peace prize in a briefing to reporters, ahead of the announcement of this year’s winner, who would have been selected earlier in the autumn.Zelenskyy said in comments released on Thursday: “If Trump gives the world – above all, the Ukrainian people – the chance for such a ceasefire, then yes, he should be nominated for the Nobel peace prize. We will nominate him on behalf of Ukraine.”Zelenskyy accused Russia of wanting to sow “chaos” inUkraineby launching strikes on his country’s energy grid and railway infrastructure, in comments published on Thursday.Moscow has in recent weeks escalated aerial attacks on Ukrainian energy facilities and rail systems.The Ukrainian military said on Thursday that it had struck the Korobkovsky gas processing plant and oil transport infrastructure in Russia’s Volgograd region overnight.The Russian defence ministry said on Thursday that its forces had struck port facilities and energy infrastructure in Ukraine’s Odesa region that were used by the Ukrainian army.Ukraine’s prime minister, the head of presidential office, and a senior sanctions adviser will go to the US early next week for talks with US officials, Zelenskyy said on Thursday.Zelenskyy wrote in a post on social media: Topics include air defence, energy, and sanctions steps, as well as the negotiation track.

But scientists have revealed a more savage side, after witnessing a greater noctule bat – Europe’s largest bat species – hunting, killing and devouring a robin mid-flight.The grisly recording reveals the bat as a formidable predator, climbing to 1.2km (4,000ft) before embarking on a breakneck-speed dive in pursuit of its prey. On capture, the bat delivered a lethal bite and subsequent chewing sounds, recorded between echolocation calls, indicated that the bat consumed the bird continuously during flight for 23 minutes without losing altitude.“It’s fascinating that bats are not only able to catch them, but also to kill and eat them while flying,” said Dr Laura Stidsholt, a co-author of the research based at Aarhus University. “A bird like that weighs about half as much as the bat itself – it would be like me catching and eating a 35-kilo animal while jogging.”Billions of birds seasonally migrate at night and over long distances at high altitude and their flight paths are known to intersect with bat hunting grounds. Dr Carlos Ibáñez, of the Doñana Biological Station, Seville, first made the case that birds were an important food resource during the pre-hibernation – autumn – and gestation – spring – periods after observing feathers in bat faeces 25 years ago. Other scientists were sceptical, however, and in the intervening years Ibáñez and colleagues have deployed surveillance cameras, military radar and ultrasound recorders attached to hot air balloons in a quest for smoking gun evidence.In the latest study, greater noctule bats were taken from nesting boxes in southernSpainand fitted with tiny “backpacks” containing instruments to record acceleration, altitude and audio, including echolocation calls. The data revealed two instances of bats mounting attacks on migratory birds, one of which was successful.This bat was observed to climb to an altitude of 1.2km, before encountering its prey. “The bat is flying in stealth mode,” said Stidsholt. “It’s night-time, the bird can’t see it coming, it can’t hear the echolocation sounds. The bat has an advantage.”On close approach – perhaps alerted by the bat’s wingbeats or its shadow – the bird suddenly entered a downward spiral. The bat was observed to follow in a cat-and-mouse chase covering more than 1km, during which the microphone recorded 21 distress calls from the robin. As the pair approached ground level, a final shriek was heard from the robin, followed by 23 minutes of chewing sounds from the bat as it continued to fly at low altitude.“From a human perspective, I didn’t feel good about it,” said Stidsholt. “But, on the other hand, the bat is a very rare species and it isn’t doing very well in southern Europe due to droughts and wild fires so we want this species to have a good meal.”Previously, Ibáñez had collected, and stored in a freezer, severed songbird wings found under bats’ hunting grounds. X-ray imaging and DNA analysis of 11 wings suggested that the bats bite off and discard the wings – probably to reduce weight and drag. The researchers believe that the bats then stretch the membrane between their hind legs forward like a pouch, allowing them to eat the rest of the bird mid-flight.Elena Tena, of Doñana Biological Station and a lead author of the study, said: “While it evokes empathy for the prey, it is part of nature.”The findings are published in the journalScience.Explore more on these topicsAnimal behaviourBiologySpainEuropeWildlifeMammalsBirdsnewsShareReuse this content"

We must be vigilant in order to ensure that technology does not replace human beings, and that the information and algorithms that govern it today are not in the hands of a few,” he said.He nominated “transparency of sources of ownership, accountability, quality and objectivity” as key to news media.“I urge you: never sell out your authority,” he said.The pope cast a light specifically on the work of newswire reporters.“One form of active citizenship is to value and support ... agencies that demonstrate seriousness and true freedom in their work ... a virtuous circle that benefits society as a whole,” he said.“Journalists working for news agencies are called upon to be the first to arrive on the scene and report on the breaking news. This is even more true in the era of continuous live communication and the increasingly pervasive digitisation of mass media.”News agencies deliver a service which “requires competence, courage and a sense of ethics”.“This is invaluable and must be an antidote to the proliferation of ‘junk’ information,” the pope said.Explore more on these topicsPope Leo XIVCatholicismReligionArtificial intelligence (AI)Press freedomNewspapers & magazinesChristianitynewsShareReuse this content"

And why not? The Nobel committee is meeting in Oslo to divvy up its annual gongs andDonald Trump, convening his cabinet – and the media – in the White House had a good story to tell.After two years of death, destruction, starvation and captivity for Israeli hostages inGaza, peace at last was at hand. Israel and Hamas were on the brink of a historic deal, brokered by the man in the Oval Office, who has made no secret of his desire to be known as the president of peace.Joy and anxiety as Hamas and Israel prepare to implement ceasefire dealRead moreThe stakes in Gaza are so gravely baleful that it would be churlish to ascribe selfish motives to the cabinet meeting’s main theme.Yet the timing was, shall we say, serendipitous.Today is Thursday, tomorrow Friday – by coincidence, the day the winner of the Nobel will be announced.But Trump, whose previous expressions of desire for the same prize awarded to Barack Obama have bordered on the avaricious, was all decorum and restraint – at least on that narrow issue alone.In the course of a 70-minute meeting, the N word went unmentioned – apart from by one journalist near the end, whose question about Trump’s views on the prize went unanswered.There was going to be “peace in the Middle East”, he said portentously.“I think it’s going to be a lasting peace, hopefully an everlasting peace,” he added, no ambition being too great.“It will be a day of joy,” the president said, when the remaining living Israeli hostages – believed to be 20 in number – are released on Monday or Tuesday.“They’re dancing in the streets. They’re so happy. Everybody’s happy. They’re dancing in the streets of Arab countries, Muslim countries, I’ve never seen anything like it.”Everyone around him deserved credit, the president said magnanimously. “JD [Vance], you were fantastic. And Pete [Hegseth], you were great. Marco [Rubio] was fantastic. I mean, some of you were very much involved. I think almost everybody in this room was involved. Susie [Wiles, the White House chief of staff], I want to thank you very much. You were incredible … and then you have Steve Witkoff [his personal envoy].”But it fell to Rubio, the secretary of state and acting national security adviser, to supply the heavy hint to the Nobel committee in Norway.“I don’t know if the one day perhaps the entire story will be told about the events of yesterday, but suffice it to say – it’s not an exaggeration – that none of it would have been possible without the president. Without the president of the United States being involved,” enthused the man once disparaged by Trump as “little Marco”.That drew a round of applause from the cabinet – the second of the meeting, the first being for Trump’s announcement at the beginning that a national holiday on the second Monday of October would henceforth be known as Columbus Day.Rubio warmed to his theme. The achievement transcended dry geopolitics to encapsulate the person of Trump himself.“Yesterday was a human story,” he said. “And because of the work you put in. And honestly, not only is there no other leader in the world that could have put this together, Mr President, but frankly, I don’t know of any American president in the modern era that could have made this possible because of the actions you have taken unrelated to this, and because of who you are, and what you’ve done, and how you’re viewed.”But this was still a Trump cabinet meeting, and it would not have been complete without some dissonant notes.They were duly supplied by the jarring contrast between the promise of peace and harmony in the Middle East and the darkening prospect of war, or at least civil disharmony, in America.Trump only had good words to say about countries in the Middle East who were he said were on board with his peace deal – even Iran, a country which he recently bombed but now said he wanted to see rebuilt.But here at home an “enemy from within” had to be confronted. Troops were to be deployed onto the streets of US cities to show elected local Democratic mayors and governors who was boss.Kristi Noem, the homeland security secretary, reported going to Portland and meeting the governor, mayor, chief of police and highway patrol superintendent.“They are all lying and disingenuous and dishonest people,” she declared, charitably, “because as soon as you leave the room, then they make the exact opposite response.” This presumably because the officials named depicted their city in somewhat more peaceful terms than the warzone of Noem et al’s fevered narrative.Yet taking the prize for low blows was JD Vance, who understood that the unifying theme of the meeting was Trump’s nascent success in ending bloodshed in the Middle East – yet failed to grasp that this call for a display of graciousness on his part.The vice-president has been known at cabinet gatherings to double up with contrived laughter at his boss’s jokes.This time he decided the best policy was to repurpose for his own use one of Trump’s tried-and-tested jibes – at the expense of Chuck Schumer, the Democrats’ leader in the Senate.“The one thing I would say is obviously the president of the United States, a New York real estate billionaire, one of the most famous New Yorkers in the world, has a lot of interaction with a lot of people who are very pro-Israel,” said Vance.Then, perhaps realizing that he could not reach the giddy heights of Rubio’s testimonial, he added: “He also, of course, knew one of the most famous Palestinians in the world, Chuck Schumer.”The crack provoked laughter. It is one of Trump’s cruelest taunts against Schumer, a fellow New Yorker who is proudly Jewish and a staunch supporter of Israel. Given the current backdrop, retreading it at this point struck a particularly discordant note.JD, it seems, has secret aspirations as a king of comedy. A calling missed, perhaps. But someone needs to tell him about timing – and context.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpThe US politics sketchNobel peace prizeTrump administrationUS politicsRepublicansMarco RubiofeaturesShareReuse this content"

Photograph: Kevin Mazur/Getty Images for KPAs her Lifetimes tour hits the UK, we pick the high points from one of pop’s most successful vocalists, from angsty ballads to empowerment anthemsByAlexis PetridisThu 9 Oct 2025 09.01 EDTLast modified on Thu 9 Oct 2025 10.12 EDTShare20. I Kissed a Girl (2008)There’s no getting around the fact that Katy Perry’s breakthrough single has not aged well in some ways – the lyrics are like a lads’ mag reader’s idea of female bi-curiosity – but musically it’s an impressively fizzy retooling of the early-70s low glam sound, with crunchy guitars and glitterbeat drums.19. 365 (2019)German EDM producer Zedd is not renowned for the subtlety of his musical approach, which makes his Perry collab a pleasant surprise: low on big drops and the kind of synth riffs that get the Las Vegas bros waving their hands in the air, it’s got a sweet melody.18. Harleys in Hawaii (2019)A Charlie Puth co-write that apparently documents a holiday Perry spent with her then beau Orlando Bloom. The lyrics are pretty frightful – it rhymes “hula-hula” with “take me to the jeweller” – but no matter: driven by acoustic guitar, the music is intriguingly misty and understated – and oddly charming.17. ET (ft Kanye West) (2011)Originally written by Perry with the intention of giving it to horrorcore rap pioneers Three 6 Mafia – truly, the mind boggles. In the end, she kept the rock/hip-hop hybrid for herself. The remix, with a star turn by808s and Heartbreak-era Kanye, is the version to hear.16. Swish Swish (ft Nicki Minaj) (2017)Taylor Swift’s Bad Blood was supposedly a jab at Perry, and this is supposedly a jab back. The exact subject of Swish Swish is less important than its appealingly sparse 90s house-influenced sound, the Roland Clark-by-way-of-Fatboy Slim sample and Nicki Minaj’s splendid this-is-how-to-throw-shade guest verse.15. Thinking of You (2008)A burst of surprisingly angsty, distinctly Alanis Morissette-like soft-rock power balladry (“He kissed my lips, I tasted your mouth … I was disgusted with myself”) that unexpectedly cropped up on breakthrough album One of the Boys. It’s not a style that Perry has really pursued since, which is a shame.14. Unconditionally (2013)Perry trailed Prism, the album she made after her divorce from Russell Brand, as “shoegazing”, which it definitely wasn’t, although you couldmaybehear the faintest glimmer of it in Unconditionally’s echoing guitars. Its real thrust, however, is its big old Max Martin-assisted chorus, custom-made to get arena crowds’ phone lights on and fists in the air.View image in fullscreenUnashamedly pop … at the Brit awards, 2014.Photograph: Karwai Tang/WireImage13. Never Really Over (2019)So similar to Dagny’s 2017 track Love You Like That that the song’s authors got co-writing credits, Never Really Over is nevertheless a precision-tooled pop earworm. Its despair at a relationship that won’t lie down and die is undercut by the faint sense the protagonist is secretly rather enjoying herself.12. Waking Up in Vegas (2008)Perry’s early appeal in a nutshell. Waking Up in Vegas’s depiction of a hungover couple attempting to piece together the previous night’s events in Sin City is preposterous, funny (“Did we get hitched last night?” it ponders, adding a panicked “Don’t call your mother!”) and packs a nailed-on chorus.11. Last Friday Night (TGIF) (2010)Inspired by Black Eyed Peas’ I Gotta Feeling, the new wave-infused Last Friday Night offered a more realistic and relatable party anthem. Drunken misbehaviour and a maxed-out credit card get them kicked out of the bar, the police may or may not have been called and, uh-oh, the photos “ended up online – I’m screwed”.10. Birthday (2013)Birthday marries the kind of melody Mariah Carey might have sung early in her career to Daft Punk-inspired disco-house – although it’s unlikely the Parisian duo would have countenanced something so unashamedly pop, or indeed so laden with Carry On-esque double entendres: “It’s time to bring out the big balloons”.9. The One That Got Away (2010)The One That Got Away was the only one of six singles from Teenage Dream not to make No 1 in the US, but that’s no reflection on its quality. The jackhammer beat makes it dancefloor-friendly, but the song spikes the singer’s frothy image with a hefty dose of wistfulness and melancholy.8. Firework (2010)For a few years after its release, Firework was wearyingly ubiquitous: no TV talent show was complete without it blaring out when a contestant passed their audition. The passing of time has made it easier to appreciate as a perfectly turned piece of anthemic pop songcraft. Allegedly inspired by – would you believe – Jack Kerouac’s On the Road.7. Dark Horse (ft Juicy J) (2013)Prism was the sound of Perry picking sorrowfully through the wreckage of her marriage to Brand. The subject matter didn’t dent her pop smarts, but it may well have influenced the music’s hue: the trap-influenced Dark Horse had a noticeably different tone to her previous hits.6. Roar (2013)The fifth biggest-selling single in the world in 2013, shifting 9.9m units, Roar offers an immense singalong chorus and the kind of post-heartbreak self-empowerment sentiments destined to be belted out at karaoke nights by the recently divorced for the rest of time.5. Chained to the Rhythm (2017)A flip into singing about serious issues was always going to be fraught for a pop star as wilfully cartoonish as Perry, and so it proved on her fifth album, Witness. That said, her first attempt, aided by Martin, is pretty great – not so much for its critique of late-stage capitalism as for its monster chorus.View image in fullscreenMonster chorus … Glastonbury, 2017.Photograph: Ian Gavan/Getty Images4. California Gurls (ft Snoop Dogg) (2010)Influenced by the Beach Boys and, more unexpectedly, Big Star – the spelling was changed to match their September Gurls after frontman Alex Chilton’s death – this song was intended as a west coast answer to Jay-Z’s Empire State of Mind.Snoop Doggturns up in fine laconic style; every melody is a hook.Katy Perry: Woman’s World review – what regressive, warmed-over hell is this?Read more3. Hot N Cold (2008)The ghost of late-80s pop hovered appealingly over Hot N Cold, particularly in its more guitar-heavy Rock Mix. You could imagine Tiffany or Debbie Gibson performing it, although they were unlikely to sing “you PMS like a bitch, and I would know”. Whichever version you pick, it’s a killer pop song.2. Wide Awake (2012)Written for the documentary Katy Perry: Part of Me and subsequently added to Teenage Dream, Wide Awake is the best of Perry’s teary post-divorce tracks. It’s anthemic but sparse and thoughtful, noticeably less straightforwardly eager to please than Roar and more emotionally impactful for it. She later sang it dressed as a ballot paper at an Obama rally.1. Teenage Dream (2010)In 2014, composer and arranger Owen Pallett offered a detailedmusical theorist’s examinationof why Teenage Dream was so popular. It is apparently all to do with syncopation in the vocal line and a lack of I chords, the latter a trick also used in Fleetwood Mac’s Dreams (Lorde even went so far as to describe the song as “holy”). But whatever the technical breakdown, there’s no doubt Teenage Dream works. Its lovestruck optimism is shot through with nostalgia, and its euphoric chorus is supremely contagious, meaning it stood out even among the plethora of hits spawned by its parent album.Katy Perry plays Utilita Arena, Sheffield, 10 October; Utilita Arena, Birmingham, 11 October; and the O2, London, 13 and 14 OctoberExplore more on these topicsRankedKaty PerryPop and rockKanye WestSnoop DoggfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It marked the emergence of the US as an interventionist global superpower, cemented the UK-US “special relationship” and prevented countries close to the US falling under Hitler’s control, securing victory in the Atlantic and freeing up forces and resources to defend Europe. It fired up independence movements in the Caribbean, while influencing West Indian music and fashion.But the Caribbean civilians who built and worked on the bases received little recognition in the UK.Now a new short film, Cornwallis Cloth, will begin screening at the Old Royal Naval College in London from Saturday, with a cast includingPaterson Joseph(Peep Show, Noughts + Crosses, the RSC) and Suzette Llewellyn (Mr Loverman, Holby City) bringing the era to life. The film will be accompanied by an exhibition exploring its themes and the historical background of the stories it uncovers.View image in fullscreenFilm-makers Tony Thompson and Rebecca Goldstone of Sweet Patootie ArtsPhotograph: IWMThe installation follows 30 years of investigative research, including testimonies and diaries from Caribbean elders, veterans in the East End, merchant seamen, American airmen and German U-boat crew, co-director Tony Thompson said.The Old Royal Naval College said they were “delighted” to present the film, while an IWM 14-18 NOW Legacy Fund spokesperson said the project “explores the transformational impact of war on men, women and children living in the British Caribbean, providing a new way to interpret and remember these important – if underexplored – stories.”Thompson, who produced the film with Rebecca Goldstone, co-founder of Sweet Patootee Arts, said: “Thousands of workers from across the Caribbean were recruited to build all these air and naval bases in record time. They went wherever they were needed – Bermuda, St Lucia, Antigua, Trinidad – and did the heavy lifting and groundworks, putting up hangars and a lot of the outbuildings and laying roads.”In the 1930s,Caribbean trade unionsand workers were at the vanguard of the civil rights movement, with sugar estates, banana plantations, docks and coaling stations rocked by strikes and marches. Nonetheless, the British government resisted demands for universal adult suffrage and independence for Caribbean nations.Soon after, however, the Atlantic became a theatre of war. As German U-boat submarine campaigns targeted shipping routes used for vital goods such as oil (from Venezuela) and bauxite, the raw material for aluminium, (from what was then British Guiana), the Caribbean became strategically important.Britain was dependent on imports to survive and win the war. By 1940, prime minster Winston Churchill desperately needed new warships for the Royal Navy’s battle of the Atlantic.The result was what has become known as the “destroyers for bases” deal, in which US president Franklin D Roosevelt agreed to provide US-built destroyer warships in exchange for bases in British territories in the Caribbean.The air and naval bases – in Antigua, the Bahamas, the former British Guiana, Barbados, Bermuda, Jamaica, St Lucia and Trinidad – would prove critical to anti-submarine warfare.View image in fullscreenA US naval base in TrinidadPhotograph: IWMFor the workers of the Caribbean who volunteered to build them, it meant higher wages and political leverage.Thompson, artistic director of Sweet Patootee Arts, said: “The only way the colonial powers could make those bases operational was to agree to civil rights concessions. Suddenly the British government and the colonial machine desperately needed the people whose resistance it had put down.”Cornwallis Cloth, commissioned by the Imperial War Museum’s Legacy Fund, explores Caribbean civil rights struggles in the war era through the story of the character Bonita Skeete, revisiting the 1942 German torpedo attack on the merchant ship SS Cornwallis in Barbados.The story was inspired by oral histories that came from Barbadian elders including Belfield DaCosta Ifill, who travelled to Trinidad for construction work, and James Stewart, who went on to join the Royal Engineers after building military roads.The film-makers also interviewed Michael Manley, the lawyer and trade unionist who became Jamaican prime minister in the 1970s, and Alfred Hilaire from Trinidad, who as a teenager was recruited to blast rocks, drive Jeeps and tie metal piles underwater because of his free-diving skills.In Hamburg, the film-makers tracked down Herbert Schlipper, a former first officer on a German U-boat, who described how “everybody was happy” to be posted to the Caribbean after the “most terrible” fighting in the north Atlantic.However, the allied anti-submarine warfare, supported by the chain of destroyer bases in the Caribbean, drove Axis forces from the region.View image in fullscreenA Barbadian newspaper reporting the U-boat attack on the SS CornwallisPhotograph: IWMSongs recorded by Lord Invader in the 1940s, likeRum And Coca-ColaandYankee Dollar– in which he sang “now the war is over, Trinidad is getting harder” – explored the impact of the US presence in Trinidad. But much of the era has been shrouded by “archival silence around Black history, cold war aspects and geopolitical rivalries”, Thompson said.He added: “People just didn’t tell their stories. Some of them went on to join the RAF, others went back to plantations or came to the UK. There were Barbadians and Trinidadians who didn’t speak of this period for years.“The American presence would have a massive impact on the Caribbean – the economy, the cultural and social experience. The influence can be heard in calypso and seen in the fashions of the Empire Windrush.“It transformed Caribbean societies crippled by the Great Depression, plantation economies defined by squeezed wages and deliberate unemployment, all of which had fired up the civil rights movement. The tacit agreement between Caribbean workers’ leaders and colonial officials to support the war effort brought a semblance of equality.”Cornwallis Cloth opens on 11 October.Explore more on these topicsCaribbeanBlack British cultureSecond world warImperial War MuseumsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.I am 47 and have become sensitive to smell – particularly smells of fabric softeners and perfumes. I don’t want to be with people who apply strong scents as the smell makes me feel sick.There’s a boy in my neighborhood whom my children want to play with occasionally, but I don’t want to have him in our apartment as the smell of softener that permeates from him is so strong. I don’t want to say no to them playing together. What should I say to my kids and the boy about why he can’t come in to play?– Sick of PerfumeMy sympathies: never before has smelling “good” been such big business.Fragrance was thefastest-growing categoryamong mass beauty retailers over the first half of 2025, continuing a years-long perfume boom that’s conditioned consumers to eliminate their own natural odors withfull-body deodorants; stink themselves up again with specially made scents for the body, hair,vaginaand/ortesticles; and drench their clothes in multi-product “laundry cocktails” for good measure.The hashtag #PerfumeTikTok boasts 4.8m posts. Atomizers arestatus symbols. People pay$4,000for discontinued formulas andprayfor brands to release bigger bottles. The market’s so hot that Sephora, Ulta and TikTok Shop are engaged in an “all-out ‘fragrance war” – and consumers are losing. We’ve collectively flushed$85.6bndown thetoilettethis year, cost of living crisis be damned.On what can we blame this senseless embrace of scents? My take: science tells us that odor molecules travel straight to the brain’s emotional center andbypass the part that handles logic; cue illogical obsession! (And Avon’s brand-new and aptly named perfume line,Perfect Nonsense.)But a sounder, less snarky theory comes from Cari Casteel, a University of Buffalo professor whohypothesized thatCovid-era isolation “de-acclimated some people to the normal odor of their fellow human, and that when we came back together … hyperawareness of other people’s odor has led to hyperanxiety about our own odor”, reported the Atlantic. In uncertain and unhealthy times, deodorants, colognes and fabric softeners may provide feelings of control, cleanliness and health.The irony – as you know – is that fragrance makes many people sick.A2019 surveyof citizens across the US, Australia, UK and Sweden found that as many as one in three respondents self-reported fragrance sensitivities. Common symptoms of this (under-studied and under-understood) condition include congestion, watery eyes, headaches, migraines, skin rashes, asthma attacks, dizziness and fainting.“Around20% of fragrance ingredientsare [potential] allergens,” Lindsay Dahl, an environmental health expert and the author ofCleaning Housetells me. Allergens appear in both natural and synthetic products – and even in so-called “fragrance-free” products, which often “use fragrances to mask the base ingredients”, Dahl says.“It’sestimatedthat the amount of fragrances in consumer products has doubled since 1990,” she adds, which could explain your later-in-life sensitivity.Womenare also “two to three times more likely” to react poorly to these chemicals. “The hypothesis is that women are exposed to more fragrances throughout their day including household cleaners, beauty products, laundry detergents and workplace exposures,” according to Dahl.In your case, add play dates to the list.My suggestion for what to say to your kids and their detergent-doused friend about why he can’t come over is nothing – at least not at first.

Now he wants me and my mother to get work doneI want to ignore beauty culture. But I’ll never get anywhere if I don’t look a certain wayThat doesn’t mean you can’t set boundaries for your health! It just means you should be extra considerate, especially if you’re white, wealthy or otherwise privileged, andespeciallyif the family in question is from a different racial, economic or cultural background.When talking to the parents, be straightforward and kind. Don’t mention their fabric softener. Keep the focus on your needs rather than their laundry. Try something like: “Just so you know, I have a sensitivity to fragrances and they can make me feel unwell, so we can’t really host play dates inside our house. My kids really enjoy playing with [insert name here] though, and he’s welcome to come play with us outside or at the park anytime!”If your children have questions about why their friend can’t come inside, there’s no need to single outhissmell. Explain your sensitivity – “It’s like a peanut allergy in my nose” – and frame it as a house rule. This way, your kids don’t feel like you’re blocking a friendship and the boy doesn’t feel fabric softener-shamed.Finally, a bit of advice for the scent-obsessed among us: now that you know 33% of people around you could experience adverse reactions to your aroma, consider lightening up on the fragrance. Orspritz before bed, instead! You could save yourself some money – and someone else a headache.Share your experienceAsk us a questionDo you have a beauty question for Ask Ugly?

The Strangers wasn’t supposed to do all that much back in 2008, released almost two years after it was made on the cheap, pushed around the schedule like it was toxic waste. But it was a surprise summer sleeper, making almost 10 times its budget and quickly entering the horror iconography hall of fame, with its nightmarishly mismatched masked villains and the chillingly hollow “because you were home” non-explanation.Roofman review – Channing Tatum and Kirsten Dunst lift fact-based crime caperRead moreA tortured decade of stop-start attempts to make a follow-up finally resulted in 2018’s underwhelming remixThe Strangers: Prey at Night, a sequel entirely devoid of the clammy tension that made the original so unbearably effective. That really should have been the last hurrah but, inevitably it was not, a three-part reboot kicking off last year withThe Strangers: Chapter 1, a rubbishy Slovakia-filmed do-over only outdone for head-smashing pointlessness by its sequel, which flopped in and out of cinemas last month (I would expect the third to go straight to streaming). All of this started with writer-director Bryan Bertino, whose post-Strangers career has been similarly awkward, with projects scrapped (including a Sam Raimi-produced horror called The Man) and non-entities like Mockingbird and The Monster failing to register with even the most devoted of horror fans. He had a little bit more luck with 2020’s grim rural horrorThe Dark and the Wickedbut it hasn’t been the ascent of a bold new voice in the genre that many had expected, and his latest is a disappointing reminder of exactly what’s been lost since 2008.Vicious was supposed to be something of a comeback, a major studio horror with a wide summer release and a concept that should easily make it franchise-ready. But after its August date was quietly cancelled, the film is now tumbling on to Paramount+ instead, likely to be lost in the Halloween streaming glut.Like The Strangers, in another attempt to recapture a shred of that film’s success, it’s about an unwanted visitor and a late-night bang on the door. This time on the receiving end is Polly (Dakota Fanning), a woman trying to get her life together a little later than those around her, living alone in a family-owned home beyond her means, struggling to mature into her 30s. On the other side is a mysterious older woman (Kathryn Hunter) who lies her way inside before presenting Polly with a box, something you really don’t want to be presented with in a horror film. She explains that in order to survive the night, she has to give it something she loves, something she hates and something she needs.It’s a set-up that raises a box-load of questions yet Bertino isn’t able to elegantly answer them, leaving us unmoored as the chaos begins. By the time the box opens, we’re also a little bored, a slow build that’s a littletooslow, limply introducing Fanning’s stock fuck-up character, complete with tattooed arms, bottle of wine and ice-cream straight from the tub (never a good sign!). Bertino is a skilled conjurer of atmosphere and he makes the most of the darkness surrounding her (a suburban street over more remote isolation also makes for a refreshing change) but the gimmick at the centre of Vicious just isn’t sticky or scary enough to rival other, more proficient, adjacent horrors like Drag Me to Hell or The Ring or Smile or some of the better Saw movies. It’s so loosely constructed – the threat is coming from where, the penalty for failure is what, the powers of the box go how far – that it’s hard to know what’s happening and why we should care.In place of suspense or dread, Bertino gives us gore, the only real element connecting the title to the film, and it’s certainly nasty enough to provoke a reaction, at least in the moment. But there’s only so much cutting and hacking and stabbing that can distract from unsure writing that isn’t taking us anywhere or really pushing us into pondering the uneasy moral questions at its centre. Even at 98 minutes, the film feels bloated, a last act of teasing, anticlimactic non-endings proving tiresome and ultimately incoherent, as if Bertino was doing panicked rewrites while he shoots (it’s very, very clear why this one was denied a theatrical release). Fanning is a more committed, if still not entirely convincing, final girl than she was in last summer’s silly fairy horrorThe Watchersbut the novelty of watching Hunter do her all-in over-the-top genre bit has truly worn off, fatigue setting in halfway through last year’s genuinely atrocious bodily fluid-driven flopThe Front Room. There’s a similarly exhausting excess to her performance here.Bertino doesn’t need to give us another Strangers, and we certainly do not need anything else in that particular universe, but he needs to give us something more striking, and certainly stranger, than Vicious.Vicious is out on Paramount+ on 10 OctoberExplore more on these topicsHorror filmsDakota FanningreviewsShareReuse this content"

On Thursday, the streaming giant released Victoria Beckham, a three-part series that follows the pop star turned fashion designer ahead of showing her spring/summer ‘25 at Paris fashion week. There are TikTok dances, tears, a lot of chat about mud, and one big revelation, which you can read more abouthere. And now for nine other things we learned from the show.They don’t seem to own any mugsKitchen cabinets are usually filled with a range of questionable novelty mugs alongside the usual dinnerware, but not at the Beckham headquarters, it appears. Victoria seems to exclusively drink out of sippy cups, including glass and steel versions. She also uses a glass straw with a tiny monogrammed VB – a birthday gift from her parents that her mum, Jackie Adams, reminds her about as Victoria mixes her a gin and Coke. The only time we see Victoria sip from a traditional vessel is when she glugs a glass of red wine before the couple head to a dinner with King Charles. A pretty confident move when wearing white silk.David follows instructions to stand on her right sideView image in fullscreenDavid Beckham and Victoria Beckham at King Charles’s Highgrove House in February.Photograph: Finnbarr Webster/Getty ImagesIt is part of a strategy to make her look less “miserable” when they pose for photographers. The idea came about when Victoria realised that David was always standing on her left. “When I smile, I smile from the left because if I smile from the right I look unwell. So I was smiling … but no one could see it.” Perhaps proof that examining pictures of yourself and having multiple mirrors in a home is not great for self-esteem.She sort of pissed off Donatella VersaceIn 1997, Victoria attended her very first fashion show when Donatella Versace – whose daughter was obsessed at the time with the Spice Girls – invited her to Milan. After sending a private jet to collect her, Donatella told her to visit the store and pick whatever she wanted to wear to the show. Victoria chose a black leather dress but on the condition they would shorten it and change the sleeves. At the time, Donatella says she thought: “How dare she do it!” But after seeing Posh Spice on the front row at the show, she had to admit: “She knows what works for her body.”Fashion cameos are a power flexFor someone who was not originally “taken seriously in the industry”, getting Vogue’s Anna Wintour, the designers Tom Ford, Donatella Versace and Roland Mouret, alongside the photographer Juergen Teller to sit down and talk about your fashion success is quite the trump card.She‘buried her boobs in Baden-Baden’View image in fullscreenVictoria Beckham at the 2006 World Cup when her husband, David Beckham, was playing for England.Photograph: Ronald Wittek/EPAAfter leaning heavily into her WAG aesthetic (all low-cut tank tops, teeny hot pants, and giant bags and sunglasses) at the 2006 World Cup in Germany, Victoria ditched it and her“purchased boobs”to “become a much more simpler, more elegant version of myself”.Victoria bought ‘Beckingham Palace’ by herselfAs Victoria was “richer” than David when they married, she bought them their first home, a sprawling mansion in Hertfordshire. Before moving in, she did a £3m renovation that included the addition of a maze, Disney-themed friezes and an Audrey Hepburn-themed bathroom, resulting in the tabloids quickly renaming the house “Beckingham Palace”.She has spent £70,000 on houseplantsPlus an additional £15,000 for someone to water them once a month. To be honest, we are more shocked she loves amonstera.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFashion StatementFree weekly newsletterStyle, with substance: what's really trending this week, a roundup of the best fashion journalism and your wardrobe dilemmas solvedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

On meeting her, the French designer decided “we had to kill the Wag”. Cue the post-Baden-Baden transformation.Victoria didn’t have formal fashion training so she couldn’t sketch - instead she used to drape fabric around her body to fashion the type of dress she wanted to create. Mouret kept making her re-do them because if he wasn’t tough, then “Victoria Beckham will walk all over me”. Cue multiple tears but eventually a collection of 10 dresses she launched during New York fashion week in 2008.David has a ‘magnificent’ cockFollowing on from that “Islands in the Stream” kitchen dance and the viral “Be honest” moment from the first docuseries, there is a lot of gentle piss-taking between the couple, who have been married for 26 years. Victoria teases David for wearing fake tan, he attempts to give her some styling advice pre-show. She mocks him for arriving to parties before the hosts and when a team member asks about the size of his chicken coop, without missing a beat Victoria quips: “You should see his cock – it’s magnificent”.To read the complete version of this newsletter – complete with this week’s trending topics in The Measure and your wardrobe dilemmas solved –subscribe to receive Fashion Statementin your inbox every Thursday.Explore more on these topicsFashionFashion Statement newsletterVictoria BeckhamNetflixnewslettersShareReuse this content"

Photographs by John ColeSeascape: the state of our oceans is supported byAbout this contentThu 9 Oct 2025 07.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 9 Oct 2025 21.31 EDTShareAsmall flotilla of gaily coloured fishing boats line the shingle beach at Hastings, East Sussex. Behind them are the bulldozers that shunt them into the waves and beyond, in neat rows, are black wooden fishermen’s huts and fish stalls, where on a good day teenage daughters, wives and retired skippers sell some of the day’s catch.This is the Stade, a Saxon word for “landing place” from where wooden boats have set off since before William the Conqueror arrived in 1066.But a decline in Britain’s fishing industry has hit many coastal communities hard. Hastings, home to one of the UK’s oldest fleets and the largest beach-launched fleet in Europe, is one of the worst hit. The fleet,which had 53 registered boats in 2015, has 18 today,a drop of 66%. Of them, most lie idle, the fishers say.View image in fullscreenPeter White outside his shed. He has been fishing for 52 years“Fishing has nosedived here,” says Peter White, 67, who has fished since he left school at 15. “A lot of people have left. From here all the way up the eastern channel as far as Whitstable. Harbours are empty, boats are gone. Fishing is on the floor. These boats haven’t been at sea for a month.”No one is at sea today, due to westerly winds, which worsen the further out you go, he says, and even on a good day, there’s fewer than eight active.These small “under 10” metre boats are the backbone of the UK industry; they represent79% of the fleetandreportedly providehalf of catch-related jobs. But in England between 2008 and 2022, they declined in numbers by 22%, nearly double the 13% fall in larger boats, according to research by Newcastle University and the University of Plymouthpublished this year.Over the same period, vessels under 10 metres also spent 43% fewer days at sea.The fishers in Hastings who spoke to the Guardian blamed multiple factors for the decline, including marine heatwaves affecting fish populations, unsustainable quotas that dictate what and how much they can fish and larger trawlers further out in the North Sea “hammering” fish stocks.View image in fullscreenTraditional small fishing boats pulled up above the high-tide line on the Stade in Hastings in 2021In White’s family, fishing goes back a century. But neither of his two daughters fish, and with most on the Stade in their sixties, he fears he is one of Hasting’s last fishers.“It’s going to die out,” says White. “Fish shops are disappearing right left and centre.”He is semi-retired, but still fishes with his nephew, Darren, 49, on his boat, the RX56, the Sussex Girl. He loves being at sea more than he ever did. “I have a pension and no mortgage to pay, so there is no pressure,” he says. “Most fishermen don’t do it for the money, they do it for the life.”The Hastings Fishermen’s Protection Society, set up in 1831 to preserve the fishing community’s right to work from the beach, has helped train 10 young people over the past decade. All except one have left for better-paying jobs elsewhere.Shane Ball, 32, whose father is a fisher, left reluctantly in November for a job as a maintenance man. “All I ever wanted to do was fish,” he says. “I skippered for 12 years.“But it came time to get a mortgage. When you go out to sea, you have to pay the fuel and the crew. Sometimes, you are literally burning the diesel for nothing.”View image in fullscreenShane Ball out at sea on a 12-hour fishing trip with his father, Robert ‘Podgy’ Ball, on their boat, the Bethan Louise, in 2017The cost of fuel has rocketed, as have other costs afterhealth and safety rulesimposed on the small boats by the Maritime and Coastguard Agency in 2023.In May, the struggling sector was dealt a further blow after a “Brexit reset” deal between the European Union and the UK. Fishers condemned the deal as a “betrayal” because it granted large EU vessels 12 years of access to UK territorial waters, right up to where the small boats fish at six miles from the coast, a year before the existing deal was due to expire. Alongside the deal, the government announced a£360m fundto modernise the fleet, boost exports and support communities.Mark Ball, 62, who fishes with his son Jamie, 30, the youngest of the Hastings crew, says earning have plummeted in the past decade. “The only way we can maintain the boat now is if we take it out of savings.”View image in fullscreenMark Ball and his son Jamie gather their catch on the deck of their boatMike Cohen, the CEO of the National Federation of Fishermen’s Organisations, says theBrexitreset deal “was a big blow” that surrendered the best prospect fishing communities had to grow.“You’ve got our little boats fishing alongside 30m-plus Spanish, French, Portuguese boats and Dutch and Danish in some places too, that can stay at sea in all weathers, fish around the clock and stay at sea for a week or fortnight in weather that our boats can’t get out from port. They can’t compete.“We gave away access to waters and we got absolutely nothing back.”Cohen has called for a national strategy for fishing and marine food production, and to deploy the £360m fishing and coastal growth fund where needed.View image in fullscreenJoe Lee’s boat, the Maria Louise, beinglaunched from the Stade in 2021. Fishers say small boats cannot compete with larger EU trawlers that can stay out far longer and in worse weatherLast week, scientists from the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea, adviseda 77% reduction in fishing of North East Atlantic mackerel to prevent population collapse. Conservationists point to a lack of a unified management plan between countries to prevent overfishing. Catch limits between EU countries and the UK in the region have consistently exceeded limits recommended by scientists.Rob Pearson, chief fisheries and conservation officer for the Sussex Inshore Fisheries and Conservation Authority, argues that good inshore management is one of the reasons England has one of the largest smallscale fleets inEurope, but it is undermined by what is happening farther offshore. The changes in health and safety rules have also had a “massive impact” on recruitment, he says.‘Slavish’ catch limits ignored scientific advice, say conservationists in case against DefraRead more“The pathway to becoming an inshore fisherman was already a struggle. It’s harder to take a crew because of the safety requirements.”Back in Hastings, Lucy Phillips, 55, and skipper Paul Stanley, 59, are sorting nets on the deck of the RX11, Christine, on the Stade. Phillips, who worked as a translator before taking up fishing four years ago, says: “It makes me sad it’s declining.“We don’t want to become a toy town, where people leave the boats and it looks like a museum,” she says.View image in fullscreenPaul Stanley, the skipper, and his partner, Lucy Phillips, with their boat, ChristineIn the old days, the Stade was “like a big family”, says Kevin Bollen, 64. “Everyone knew everyone else. As kids we used to go and pull the boats off the beach. They would give us a few fish and we went round the houses selling them. When you got to my age, you would be the ‘boy ashore’, help bring the boat in and get a quarter of a share.“This used to be one of the richest fishing grounds in the UK. Now, you’d be really pushing yourself to take £15,000 a year.”Bollen sold his boat after a cancer diagnosis more than a decade ago. “Another 10 years, I don’t think there will be boats out.”Asked what will happen to the Stade when the last fisher leaves, Bollen replies: “It’ll be turned into a car park, won’t it?”View image in fullscreenKevin Bollen, right, with the skipper and boat owner,Darren Coglan, in the latter’s shedExplore more on these topicsSeascape: the state of our oceansFishing industryFish (Food)FoodFish (Environment)Marine lifeBrexitfeaturesShareReuse this content"

How have they responded?Hannah Jane ParkinsonThu 9 Oct 2025 07.15 EDTLast modified on Thu 9 Oct 2025 09.47 EDTShareTo paraphraseTS Eliot: and was it worth it after all?A question to ponder for those who have taken the coin of a government once described unequivocally as“the worst of the worst”by one human rights advocacy organisation.The past decade has seen Saudi Arabia invest in everything from football tooperato video games – all part of the regime’s efforts to diversify its oil-dependent economy and its execution-heavy reputation.Mohammed bin Salman’s (MBS) latest interest? Comedy. TheRiyadh comedy festival, which ends today, has attracted a number of big hitters. Among them: Pete Davidson, Louis CK, Dave Chappelle, Kevin Hart, Aziz Ansari, Whitney Cummings and Jessica Kirson. While most of the performers are US based, Jimmy Carr, Jack Whitehall and Omid Djalili also appeared as headliners.Organised by Saudi Arabia’s General Entertainment Authority (GEA), the festival wasintended to“amplify Riyadh’s status as a leading destination for major cultural and artistic events”. Or, as Visit Saudididn’tput it: come for the weather and the entertainment! Stay because you’ve been arrested!View image in fullscreenAre you not entertained? GEA chairman Turki Al-Sheikh and José Mourinho at a boxing match in Riyadh.Photograph: Richard Pelham/Getty ImagesThe organiser of the festival and chair of the GEA, Turki Al-Sheikh, is a big fan of culture. Indeed, hereposted a song on Xthat celebrated the lead suspect in Jamal Khashoggi’s murder.It’s interesting that MBS has discovered a sense of humour, though, as the crown prince wasn’t laughing whenMasameer County, a South Park meets Family Guy-style satire, was picked up by Netflix and became one of the most popular shows in the region. Instead, its creator, Abdulaziz Almuzaini, wassentencedto a 13-year jail term and a 30-year travel ban for “terrorism and promoting homosexuality”.Others who have left MBS stony-faced?Fahad Albutairi, known as “Saudi Arabia’s Jerry Seinfeld”, who was allegedly handcuffed, blindfolded and put on a plane to Saudi Arabia when performing in Jordan in 2018. (He was also reported to have been forced to divorce his wife, a women’s rights activist.)Abdulrahman al-Sadhanwas jailed for 20 years for running a parody Twitter account. Tala Safwan, an Egyptian TikTok influencer and prankster wasarrested for a jokewith “lesbian subtext”. And in2018 a specific law was introducedto punish, with jail sentences and fines, anybody who produced satire online deemed to be “mocking public order”.View image in fullscreenNo laughing matter … Masameer County producer Abdulaziz Almuzaini was sentenced to 13 years in jail.Illustration: NetflixYou might think, then, that comedians most vehement in their protestations against cancel culture – Chappelle, Ansari, CK, in particular – would balk at performing in a country whose predilection for silencing extends to (alleged)murderby bone-saw.Pete Davidsonhas saidthat there were no restrictions on the material he could perform, a dubious claim given that Atsuko Okatsukaleaked a prospective contractshe was sent. The “content restrictions” section detailed anything that “may be considered to degrade, defame, or bring into public disrepute, contempt, scandal, embarrassment, or ridicule … the Kingdom of Saudi, the Saudi royal family, its legal system … religion”. (Okatsuka declined the offer.)Another reason: Tim Dillon hadhis invite rescindedafter making a quip about slavery in the kingdom, as did Jim Jefferiesafter he said: “One reporter was killed by the government … unfortunate, but not a fucking hill that I’m gonna die on.” Outing himself as an absolutely awful person and then not even getting the cash?Unfortunate. Oh, and then there’s the fact that Bill Burr, who did perform, confirmed there was censorship. But “the royals loved the show”, he said – so that’s nice.Perhaps the likes of Chappelle, Ansari and CK felt there was less at stake because, by their own estimation, they have already suffered cancellation. Except that their exile from public life appears to include fresh Netflix specials andGrammy awards. Louis CK should count himself lucky; if he’d been caught with his dick in his hand in Najd,rather than Colorado, he may well have retained neither of those appendages (punitive limb amputationis an actual thing).CK’s stance on murderous dictatorships seems to have changed since thisfull-throated criticism of Libya’s Muammar Gaddafi. But fair play to him in one sense for getting out of his comfort zone – he hasa whole bitabout giving up weed and yet here he is visiting a place where getting stoned is common. CK hasdefended himselfthus: “I struggled about going once I heard what everybody was saying.” Truly, a man of integrity.View image in fullscreenRiyadh comedy festival.Photograph: Fayez Nureldine/AFP/Getty ImagesAnother performer who has seemingly discovered their conscience after the fact is Jessica Kirson, a lesbian Jewish comic. Kirson has tied herself in knots worthy of a grovelling balloon-dog since. In astatementpost-performance, Kirson asserted her “deep regret”, saying that she was “surprised” to be asked. Disingenuous to the extreme, given the fact she openly solicited an invitationon a podcastmonths ago.Then there’s Hannibal Buress, widely praised for his significant role intaking down Bill Cosby; Buress is now taking money from a government that sentenced a 19-year-old victim of gang-rapeto 200 lashesand six months in prison. Meanwhile, I remember Jack Whitehall doing a skit about “grown adults getting wound up about cartoons”. Presumably he doesn’t mind the grown adults who got so wound up by cartoons that they sentenced satirist Al Hazzaato 23 years’ jail time for lighthearted illustrations about fasting.Of course, the primary – and here consider primary as a euphemism for only – reason for entertainers becoming sharply severed from their morals is the riyals.

Davidson was morestraightforward: “I see the number and go: ‘I’ll go’”. (The SNL alumnus has come in for particular criticism given that his firefighter father died during 9/11). Chris Distefano said that he didn’t want to do it, but thathis fiancee had instructed himto “take that fucking money”.Amore nuanced takecame from Nimesh Patel, who initially said yes before backing out. “They offered a lot of money. I’m not in a position to say no to life-changing money. But it wasn’t life-changing.” Which, given the people involved, and as David Cross said in a fiery rebuke, will be true of all of them. The actorcalled outpeers he admired who “would condone this totalitarian fiefdom for … what, a fourth house? A boat? More sneakers?” I suppose Davidson is on record asloving sneakers.View image in fullscreenDeclined … Atsuko Okatsuka leaked her prospective contract.Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The GuardianOf course, some will argue that performing in authoritarian or oppressive countries is a means of reaching the masses; opening up art to those underserved. And while that may be true on occasion, it is a different thing entirely from being sponsored by the state itself to launder its sovereignty. AsVinny Thomassarcastically put it: “Sometimes to fight the power you have to be paid by the power.”Others argue that cultural boycotts and campaigns make little difference, even whenSouth Africa,BDS, and more recently, Nan Goldin’s dismantling of theSackler family’s art patronagehave proven otherwise. Plenty of comedians joined Cross in condemnation, includingNish Kumar,Marc MaronandZach Woods. In typically forthright style, Stewart Leedescribedparticipants as “evil, amoral, grifting bastards”.And Shane Gillis, Leslie Liao, Stavros Halkias and Mike Birbiglia turned down offers alongside Okatsuka.

Photograph: Win McNamee/Getty ImagesSaudi Arabia’s investment in Twitter increased its influence in Silicon Valley while being used at home to shut down critics of the regimeByJacob SilvermanThu 9 Oct 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 9 Oct 2025 05.38 EDTShareAli al-Ahmed didn’t think thatElon Muskwas responsible for the decline and fall of Twitter. Musk was another face representing an old regime. And its sins began well before Musk bumbled into Twitter HQ, in October 2022, carrying a porcelain sink. (In an attempt at humour, Musk posted a video of himself arriving at the Twitter offices carrying a sink with the caption “Entering Twitter HQ – let that sink in!”)Ahmed was a Saudi journalist and analyst living in the Washington DC area. He was a founder of the Institute for Gulf Affairs (formerly the Saudi Institute), a Saudi-focused thinktank with an emphasis on human rights reporting, and was the kind of expert – passionate, principled, always glad to hop on the phone – that journalists loved having in their digital Rolodex.For Ahmed, who over the years had many family members imprisoned by the Saudi royal family, the pursuit of human rights was a solemn task. But he also had a kind of garrulousness – breaking into asides about his children or the talking gadget he’d invented to remind them to wash their hands – that reminded one of the deeper human stakes. “Twitter is no different from Boeing or those military companies,” Ahmed told me. “They care about making money. Twitter and Facebook are not champions or models for human rights. These people are nothing but money-grubbers.” Twitter had banned Ahmed’s Arabic-language Twitter account, which had 36,000 followers (although he was allowed to keep his English-language account).I first spoke to Ahmed in 2021, when reporting on the Saudi government’s use of Twitter to unmask and arrest people posting critically about the regime. For Saudi authorities, Twitter was an asset in every sense. The billionaire Saudi businessman Prince Alwaleed bin Talal was Twitter’s largest outside shareholder, and the site had become a key tool in the government’s apparatus of surveillance and control.Ahmed believed his Twitter account had been compromised. He worried that spies had access to it, which would endanger dissident Saudis with whom he exchanged private messages. This wasn’t an idle concern. One of his contacts wasAbdulrahman al-Sadhan, an aid worker who, in 2018, was abducted by Saudi security forces for running a satirical Twitter account that parodied members of the government. Abdulrahman, who was then 37, was sentenced to 20 years in prison.Saudi Arabia is carrying out more repression than ever, said Abdulrahman’s sister Areej al-Sadhan, who lived in the US when we spoke in 2021. In the first three years after her brother was arrested, her family had received only two brief phone calls from him. Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman, had zero tolerance for dissent or mockery. Areej has not heard from her brother for years. In a 2023 court filing, she said that she wasn’t sure if her brother was alive.Despite his attempt to portray himself as a modernising reformer, Prince Mohammed could appear every bit as repressive as past Saudi rulers, turning the country into a surveillance state where arbitrary arrests and disappearances were routine. As the brutal murder of Washington Post journalistJamal Khashoggidemonstrated, the Saudi state pursued vigorous methods of transnational repression, allegedly sending hit squads after enemies abroad.Prince Mohammed used his country’s bottomless reserves of oil and capital to flood Silicon Valley, politics, sports leagues and other power centres with cash and influence. Venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz and Peter Thiel’s investment vehicle, Founders Fund, were among the most notable recipients of Saudi money, but they were just two among hundreds. In 2016,Uber received an astonishing $3.5bnfrom Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund (PIF).Blackstone’s infrastructure fund got $20bn. By autumn 2018,the Wall Street Journal reported, Saudi Arabia had become “the largest single funding source for US startups”.The Saudi-Silicon Valley relationship represented a convergence of shared interests. Saudi Arabia, like other Gulf dictatorships, wanted to wash its money, diversify its investments, deepen influence with its most powerful ally, extend soft power and counter its image as a repressive state responsible for a devastating war in Yemen. Silicon Valley offered all of that, along with access to cutting-edge technology and a business elite coming into its own.“They’re surveillance states. They’re police states,” said Nader Hashemi, a professor of Middle East and Islamic politics at Georgetown University. “They want to use the latest technology in order to continue to remain in power and surveil their populations. So they have another interest in trying to sort of be the beneficiaries of hi-tech developments, hoping that that will help them internally with their own political rule.”The Saudi government had vast assets held in the names of senior members of the royal family. Through his Kingdom Holding Company, Prince Alwaleed had interests in businesses like Lyft and Snapchat. And until Elon Musk came along, he was Twitter’s largest outside shareholder. As Saudi Arabia became the pre-eminent source of Silicon Valley capital, Alwaleed emerged as the country’s most recognisable mogul, taking the role of leading shareholder in Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp. By 2015, the prince owned an estimated 5.2% of Twitter. In November 2017,Alwaleed was arrestedand confined to the Ritz-Carlton Hotel in Riyadh as part of a sweeping “anti-corruption” purge that forced numerous wealthy Saudis and members of the royal family to sign over their assets to Prince Mohammed. That may well have included Alwaleed’s Twitter shares.“Since late 2017 or January of 2018, Prince Mohammed has exercised control over more Twitter stock than is owned by Twitter’s founder,” according to a civil complaint filed against Twitter and the consulting firm McKinsey by Omar Abdulaziz, a film director and Saudi exile. Abdulaziz said that the consultancy helped finger him as a prominent online dissident, leading to his Twitter account being hacked. (In 2020, Canadian authorities warned Abdulaziz that he was a target of a Saudi kill team.) According to Abdulaziz’s original complaint, “Because of the tremendous wealth of key figures in [the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia], major corporations have enabled, collaborated with, and turned a blind eye to [its] efforts to suppress, torture, falsely imprison, terrorise and murder dissenters both within Saudi Arabia and around the world.” Twitter had given the Saudi government a reach well beyond its borders.At the outset, Twitter had seemed like “a great equaliser”, said Ahmed. With no independent media in Saudi Arabia and most political expression forbidden, Twitter and other social media seemed initially a place for people to speak more frankly, especially when they could be pseudonymous. “That did not last,” he told me.By the second Obama administration, Saudi Twitter had become a place for the kingdom’s rulers to propagandise, track dissident thought and identify victims for Prince Mohammed’s personal team of enforcers. Many Saudis knew better than to post on Twitter under their real names. But the Saudi government was able to unmask pseudonymous accounts and trace their owners, who were then arrested. For a long time, dissident Saudis wondered how exactly government security forces had unmasked their friends and family members, and whether there were any countermeasures they could take. They assumed the Saudi government had access to the finest western security contractors and advanced spyware software. They didn’t yet know that Prince Mohammed and his henchmen had something better: a spy ring inside Twitter itself.In June 2014, a Saudi official named Bader Al Asaker took a tour of Twitter’s San Francisco headquarters. Asaker was the secretary-general of Prince Mohammed’s personal charity, the Misk Foundation, and head of the crown prince’s private office. One of the people who arranged the tour was a Twitter employee namedAhmad Abouammo. According to US prosecutors,Asaker was grooming Abouammo, who worked on media partnerships in the Middle East, to spy for him. In the months to come, Abouammo would receive more than $100,000 in cash and gifts as he gathered information – including email addresses, phone numbers and private messages – relating to Saudi dissidents, journalists and other accounts of note.View image in fullscreen‘Let that sink in’ … Elon Musk takes over Twitter on 26 October 26 2022.Photograph: Twitter account of Elon Musk/AFP/Getty ImagesAbouammo got a new job at Amazon the following year, but the Saudi regime found a worthy replacement in Ali Alzabarah, a Twitter engineer whose position and technical skills gave him access to more user data than Abouammo. Soon enough, Alzabarah became an even more productive spy for Asaker and the Saudi regime, tracking dissidents across borders and providing IP addresses that could reveal people’s locations.In December 2015, an FBI agent visited the Twitter headquarters in San Francisco to tell them that they had a Saudi espionage problem. The FBI asked that Twitter refrain from taking immediate action but, reportedly suspicious about the intentions of government security agencies, which are known to pressure tech companies for private user information, Twitter decided to suspend Alzabarah.According to a federal indictment against Alzabarah, the engineer turned spy frantically called Asaker, who, along with the Saudi consul general of Los Angeles, helped spirit Alzabarah away to Saudi Arabia. After finding refuge there, Alzabarah was named CEO of the Misk Foundation. Almost a decade later, Alzabarah was still on X – where his account was locked for privacy – and on the FBI’s most-wanted list. Abouammo was arrested inNovember 2019 and indicted. A jury found him guilty on six criminal charges related to his spying. In December 2022, a judge sentenced him to three and a half years in federal prison.Twitter – and nowX, as it was rebranded after Musk’s takeover – has never accounted publicly for the Saudi spy ring, nor has it discussed how it plans to keep foreign agents off its payroll.If Saudi’s ruling class had doubts about Musk’s takeover of Twitter, they were short-lived. After initially criticising the brash Musk, Prince Alwaleed, now free from five-star confinement, supported his takeover effort, announcing he would roll his $1.89bn worth of shares (presumably controlled by Prince Mohammed) into the new venture. Asaker continued to use the site to propagandise to his more than 2.3 million followers.Despite Musk swooping into Twitter HQ with a promise to liberate users from the shackles of Silicon Valley technocrats, the user experience got worse.Meanwhile, Musk seemed openly transactional in his dealings with foreign governments. Whatever universal principles he claimed to hold appeared secondary, in practice, to his business concerns and his personal whims. This free-speech absolutist said nothing about Saudi Arabia’s abuse of his platform. Perhaps he was simply unaware.The company that once called itself “the free speech wing of the free speech party”, was now chasing viability via personal data collection and surveillance advertising. It did not protect its users from data breaches and it made devil’s bargains with foreign governments. As Ali al-Ahmed said, it was a typical US corporation. Except that this one had charged itself with a higher purpose and, in bumbling into foreign markets under autocratic governments where its product basically invited local people to break the law, it set up its users for trouble.View image in fullscreenJamal Khashoggi during a press conference in the Bahraini capital Manama in December 2014.Photograph: Mohammed Al-Shaikh/AFP/Getty ImagesFor Ahmed, the conviction of one Saudi spy, Abouammo, without any larger reckoning over the kingdom’s role at Twitter and in Silicon Valley, was a failure. As possibly the only known victim of the spy ring living in the US, Ahmed had offered to testify at Abouammo’s sentencing. After a video chat with representatives of the Department of Justice, he never heard back. “It was very clear that they were just trying to close this matter,” said Ahmed. “Imagine if this guy was doing it for the Iranians. Oh my God. He would get 20 [years].”He emphasised that, in a lawsuit regarding the murder of Jamal Khashoggi, the Biden administration had recognised Prince Mohammed as having sovereign immunity. The US government also intervened in a lawsuit against Prince Mohammed filed by Saad Aljabri, a former spy chief who had defected to the US. “I really think it was a betrayal of justice here,” said Ahmed. “It’s part of this foreign influence and the corruption that’s also now in the court system.”Twitter’s relationship with the Saudi government revealed how the company really operated. It wasn’t just a place for silly memes or catty media discourse or an attention-obsessed billionaire to cultivate his flock. It was an informational battleground, a crucial node in the broader media ecosystem, and formed part of the connective tissue between Silicon Valley and Gulf dictatorships. It revealed the company’s politics as riddled with the same kind of false populism and political opportunism embraced by Musk, Trump and Maga radicals. Twitter’s willingness to overlook horrific behaviour by a major investor wasn’t unique. It’s the default for most large corporations, the equivalent of a western oil giant paying bribes to operate in a foreign country. But the tech industry had long tried to paint itself as a bearer of progress, where technological innovation was synonymous with human flourishing. Twitter’s Saudi scandal showed that this wasn’t true at all.It’s possible that there were other spies working at Twitter, just as there were likely foreign agents working throughout Silicon Valley. Economic espionage is an old story. But using tech companies’ surveillance-based business model to repress dissent at home and practice transnational repression abroad was a grimly novel phenomenon. It was common for tech companies operating in foreign markets – often with minimal local staff – to face political pressures. In many cases, the result was that formerly idealistic tech firms would make compromises over censorship if it meant having access to tens of millions of users in Turkey, Egypt, Pakistan, India or China. The cybersecurity specialist known by the mononym Mudge, who consulted for Twitter, testified before Congress that India and China had agents working inside Twitter who had broad access to user data.A month after Mudge testified, Elon Musk completed his harried acquisition of Twitter. The $44bn purchase price required him to take on a lot of debt and to solicit support from friends and allies from Hawaii to San Francisco to Riyadh. By buying Twitter, Musk inherited the Saudi spy scandal and the still-unresolved litigation associated with it. He inherited a major shareholder who had committed espionage against their own asset. Yet there was still a lot we didn’t know about Twitter, Saudi Arabia and Musk.I wanted to know more about who helped Musk take Twitter private and who now owned a piece of X. Who was this powerful, volatile billionaire potentially beholden to?It wasn’t something that Musk wanted to talk about. The company had done away with its PR department. In the public imagination, Musk was X – he owned it, he was its most popular user, he set its policies, he intervened personally when one of his favourite accounts encountered issues. He owed nothing to the media. He was enjoying its death throes.When Musk acquired Twitter, he fired thousands of people and, with his blithe disregard for the tenets of employment law, provoked numerous lawsuits. By early 2024, these lawsuits – by ex-employees who said they didn’t receive severance, were coerced into quitting, or were encouraged to break the law in order to implement Musk’s edicts – were winding their way through the courts. In some suits, the plaintiffs wanted X to submit a list of its shareholders to answer questions about accountability. Who were Musk’s partners? Who might be materially affected by a lawsuit against X? Did the judge own shares in Tesla or another Musk company?This was a legitimate concern. In 2023, a liberal media watchdog group, Media Matters, produced a report that accused the site of allowing antisemitic posts next to advertising, and Musk sued them for allegedly manipulating data in an attempt to “destroy” the platform. The suit was filed in a north Texas district where one of the judges turned out to be a Tesla shareholder. US district judgeReed O’Connor owned as muchas $50,000 in Tesla stock when he took on Musk’s lawsuit against Media Matters. Judge O’Connor made a series of rulings in favour of Musk, and the case’s accumulating legal fees led to Media Matters laying off staff. In November 2024, X added a provision to its terms of service stating that all legal disputes would be settled in Judge O’Connor’s Northern District of Texas. (O’Connor ruled that his Tesla stock “is not relevant to the case”, buthe recused himself from X’s caseagainst the World Federation of Advertisers.)View image in fullscreenElon Musk leaves after a bilateral meeting in Riyadh on 13 May 2025 in his role as senior adviser to President Trump.Photograph: Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty ImagesThese kinds of shareholder document requests are common, and a corporate defendant may request to submit the information under seal, making it unavailable to the public (and potentially even the plaintiffs). In one of the cases I followed, Anoke v Twitter, one of the many civil lawsuits resulting from Musk’s chaotic takeover of the company and his mass firings of employees, X submitted a list of shareholders under seal.Wanting to file a motion to have the list unsealed, I reached out to Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press (RCFP), a first amendment organisation that offered pro bono services to journalists. Born out of the Nixon administration’s attempted censorship of the Pentagon Papers, RCFP had a distinguished history of first amendment litigation. They agreed to represent me.Together we found a few cases where it might be possible to unseal X’s shareholders list. The cases varied in their particulars, and some seemed more promising than others. But the public-interest claim was straightforward. The RCFP attorneys deployed precedent-laden arguments about X as a public square, media ownership and foreign influence and national security concerns. They contacted the many high-powered lawyers X was employing to fight these cases to formally let them know we would be filing motions to unseal. And by early July, they had completed the necessary filings. In July 2024, we officially filed a motion in the Northern District of California asking a federal judge to unseal a disclosure list of X’s shareholders in Anoke v Twitter.And then I waited.It had cost about $46.5bn for Elon Musk to acquire Twitter. The money was cobbled together from $20bn in Musk’s assets, $13bn in loans from big banks (which soon found that they couldn’t move them off their books), $6bn in loans to Musk himself, and more than $7bn in commitments from investors who would be shareholders of the new private enterprise.In a financial statement submitted to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in May 2022, Musk listed a number of his planned Twitter co-investors and their equity stakes, so we had some idea of who was helping him buy the company. Saudi Prince Alwaleed, Twitter’s largest outside shareholder, had initially been publicly critical of Musk’s offer and then – the reasons for the shift are unclear – announced that he supported Musk and would happily roll his shares into the new entity. Other reporting helped fill in some of the sources of money.But gaps remained. And once Twitter went private in October 2022 and Musk set about cutting back the divisions of the company that offended him, there was no official list of its shareholders, or the legal names of the trusts, funds, LLCs and other corporate entities holding their shares. Musk called himself a “free-speech absolutist”, but his business dealings tended to be filtered through the usual veil of corporate secrecy, legal threats, nondisclosure agreements, encrypted chats and fleets of powerful attorneys that protect very powerful people. He denounced “lawfare” – the aggressive use of lawsuits to punish one’s enemies –while widely practising it. He banned journalists from X when they displeased him and he ordered the reinstatement of the accounts of Nazis, white supremacists and a QAnon-adjacent influencer named Dom Lucre who’d once posted a screenshot from a video of a child being sexually abused. (He claimed he was drawing attention to the issue of child abuse.)On 20 August 2024, Judge Susan Illston of the Northern District of California ruled in favour of our motion in Anoke v Twitter.Hours after the ruling, the filing containing the list of X’s shareholders appeared on the online court docket, visible to anyone logged into the public court system. I’m still not exactly sure what happened, but apparently it’s a matter of a clerk clicking to change permissions on a limited-access filing, so it’s possible that someone at the court prematurely made the list available. The error, if it was one, was soon noticed by reporters at the Washington Post,who wrote an articleabout the list’s contents.Soon, the list was everywhere, published in hundreds of media outlets, becoming grist for debate, memes, misinformation, and – I hoped – researchers, regulators, and journalists looking into a powerful tech company openly in the tank for the Republican candidate for president.The list, which set out the legal names of about 95 entities owning a piece of X (but not the size of their holdings), began to fill in the picture of whom Musk depended on for cash and the networks he moved in. It was a window into a political and economic formation with increasing purchase on our world.It all started, of course, with Elon Musk. He was the majority owner of X through a trust he controlled. He was followed by Jack Dorsey, the former Twitter CEO and major shareholder who helped deliver the company to Musk. Then there was a host of other tech and finance figures, including many venture capitalists, friends of Musk who were consistent investors in his various enterprises. Some of these firms had close relationships with authoritarian governments, like Saudi Arabia and Qatar, who were direct investors in X. Andreessen Horowitz received hundreds of millions of dollars from Saudi Arabia to invest on their behalf in US tech startups and was in talks with the kingdom about creating a $40bn AI investment fund.Venture capital firms served as Laundromats for a class of kleptocrats, princelings and other global elites, who could funnel their fortunes into one of the US’s most celebrated industries. Silicon Valley venture capitalists and their foreign investors often shared a general disregard for democratic governance. In the Saudi crown prince, they saw a counterpart who demonstrated the same benevolent authoritarian style that they enacted in their business lives – but on an even grander scale, with unchallenged power. Venture capitalists published chatty manifestos about their technological aspirations; Prince Mohammed offered his own consultant-approved economic development plan known as Vision 2030. The two sides had much in common.‘The Godfather, Saudi-style’: inside the palace coup that brought MBS to powerRead more“Saudi has a founder,” Ben Horowitz of Andreessen Horowitz said at a 2023 tech conference featuring Saudi government representatives. (In tech mythology, a “founder” has elite status.)“You don’t call him a founder. You call him his royal highness.”Saudi Arabia’s ailing king and ambitious crown prince were hardly “founders” of a state that, in its current form, had been inaugurated in 1932. But the rhetoric was not just flattery. It resonated in tech circles where an increasing number of people believed that the US would be better off under a dictatorial CEO figure, not an elected president. If Trump were re-elected, Musk had the potential to become that kind of figure.When Musk acquired Twitter, there were rumblings that the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) might investigate the deal. “I call on CFIUS to immediately conduct a review of the recent changes in Twitter’s ownership and governance,” Senator Chris Murphy wrote to Treasury secretary Janet Yellen. “It is essential to our national security that public officials and citizens alike can continue to rely on this platform to be a neutral platform, free of foreign influence.” In his letter, Murphy specifically cited concerns about the Saudi government using its investment “to silence government critics and human rights activists, or to further state-sponsored disinformation campaigns”. According to the Washington Post, the investigation never happened.X did not respond to a request for comment. A Twitter spokesperson said in 2021 that it acted swiftly in 2015 when it learned there were malicious actors accessing Twitter user data. The company also said it was committed to “protecting the public conversation” from abuse by state actors.This is an edited extract from Gilded Rage: Elon Musk and the Radicalization of Silicon Valley published in audiobook and hardback by Bloomsbury Continuum.

It’s over!” For a moment, I thought I was dreaming. I wondered: what is happening? Has another loved one been targeted? What is over? Then he told me thatDonald Trumphad said it. “I am very proud to announce that Israel and Hamas have both signed off on the first Phase of our Peace Plan,” the president wrote on his social media. For the first day in a long time, people in Gaza woke up to news that could be called happy. The ceasefire went into effect at noon. The sound of Israeli warplanes still echoed in the sky, but, for once, they didn’t feel frightening.The first phase of the agreement only includes the exchange of prisoners. That means 20 Israeli hostages in Gaza thought to be alive and up to1,950 Palestiniansfrom Gaza. Israel has arrested hundreds of us over the past two years without reason. Among them are a relative of mine, detained after Israel’s bombing of theTel al-Sultan displacement campearlier this year, and Dr Hossam Abu Safieh, taken from his workplace while performing humanitarian duties in Kamal Adwan hospital.But fears remain: is the genocide really over?I went out into the streets to see friends and neighbours and exchange political observations. People seem to be trying to make the most of this first phase, as there is no guarantee that it will last. Families await the fresh arrival of gas, flour and sugar, not just to consume but to stockpile, fearing a new siege or sudden price hikes if the truce collapses. My friend Ahmed shook his head: “After the prisoners are handed over,Israelwill find a thousand ways to torture us.” Meanwhile, my friend Khader laughed jokingly: “I don’t care about anything; I just want to eat chicken and get gas into the house.”For most Palestinians inGaza, the ceasefire means no more than these small details: hot meals, cooking gas, and a break from the smoke of firewood that causes headaches and eye irritation. These simple hopes reflect a longing for normal life; for education, food and a peaceful night’s sleep.Others felt nothing. They said it was too early to judge the truce, and that their lives had been destroyed to the point where little could be saved. People are haunted by the faces of loved ones buried under rubble and the thought of spending winter in threadbare tents. Most people here now live in tents and wonder if Israel will repeat what it did during the previous truce by refusing to bring in rubble-removal equipment or temporary housing units. The Israeli army still controls about 55% of Gaza, preventing people in border areas from returning to their homes – or what remains of them.Although people are happy that the bloodshed has stopped, the catastrophe is not over; they remain displaced, refugees in their own homeland. Entire cities like Rafah and Beit Hanoun are still under direct occupation and they may have to wait for the second or third phase of the agreement for the army to withdraw.1:38'Historic moments': Palestinians and Israelis celebrate Gaza ceasefire deal announcement – videoWhile those in Gaza cling to these fragile hopes, politics on the other side of the border threatens to erase them. Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, will continue to face intense pressure from his far-right coalition partners, who view any truce as a betrayal. Figures likeBezalel Smotrich and Itamar Ben-Gvirhave warned in the past they would topple his government if he agrees to what they call “surrender”. Netanyahu’s political survival depends on these extremists and his power depends on the continuation of the conflict, given the legal troubles that could send him to prison once out of office.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Washington and Arab and Islamic capitals are pressing to maintain the truce, and European countries have startedhinting at economic sanctionsin recent months; but inside Israel, the far right demands what it calls “total victory” – a phrase that, for Palestinians in Gaza, means the expulsion and ethnic cleansing of Gaza’s population.This deal may be a gateway to ending the genocide, or a corridor to continuing it in an even harsher form once the world’s attention moves elsewhere. Yet it remains a relief for people in Gaza: roughly 400 trucks entering daily could revitalise the health sector with supplies, and opening the Rafah crossing on the border with Egypt in both directions could allow hospital patients, stranded students and families separated by the conflict to travel.The war has taken so much from us, our homes, lives and loved ones, but it has not taken away our desire to live, to rebuild and to drink a morning cup of coffee without fear.

The whole process feels surrealThu 9 Oct 2025 12.10 EDTLast modified on Thu 9 Oct 2025 15.07 EDTShareCustomers already knew their water bills rose steeply in April. Now 14.7 million people in England supplied byfive companies– Anglian, Northumbrian, South East, Southern and Wessex –will suffer steeper increases. That’s the bad news for them. The vague consolation is that the outcome could have been worse.Strange as it may look at first glance, none of the five firms got close to what they wanted when they trotted off tothe Competition and Markets Authorityto complain that Ofwat, the economic regulator, should have whacked up bills even further.Take Southern Water. Ofwat granted a mighty 48% increase in bills to £620 but the company thought £710 was needed; in the event, the CMA landed on £638. For Anglian and Northumbrian, the CMA’s top-up was a mere 1%, and even that increase seems to have owed everything to the application of updated market prices to calculate companies’ cost of equity (one of the three main considerations in the process).In a way, the beleaguered Ofwat can chalk it up as a minor moral victory. The companies’ requests for extra funding were “largely unjustified”, said the CMA – it allowed only 21% of the extra money they wanted for spending. That still adds up to the large figure of £556m to come from household and business customers but, for the most part, Ofwat’s homework withstood the remark.Yet the whole process feels surreal. First, note we’re not talking about an appeal but a “redetermination”. In other words, the CMA was not asked to act as a football-style video assistant referee and opine on whether Ofwat had made clear and obvious errors in balancing bills and companies’ funding needs. Instead, the competition regulator, in a sideline to its day job, had to rerun the entire price-control process of the specialist regulator – and do so in 12 months, whereas Ofwat gets four years. That makes little sense.Second, the regulatory system is about to be ripped up anyway after a couple of decades of sewage scandals and financial engineering. The government has already saidOfwat will be abolishedin a “reset” of a sector that has been “failing the environment, customers and investors”. In a last hurrah, the CMA had to ensure this “broken” system, as it applied to the five companies, was applied correctly.The CMA’s findings are only provisional but, on the safe-ish assumption that the final figures resemble Thursday’s, a third absurdity possibly awaits. Remember that a request for a redetermination is a formal matter: the board of directors has to make a case that Ofwat has left them unable to meet regulatory requirements. So what do you do if, like Anglian’s directors, you asked for an extra 10% but got only 1%? Resign en masse? Unlikely. But if you don’t, aren’t you accepting that you didn’t need to go to the CMA in the first place?skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The deadline could become redundant if Thames sinks into special administration, AKA temporary nationalisation, or ifthe bondholdersare allowed to take control, or if yet another extension is granted. If Thames does go to the CMA, a final decision may arrive in mid-2026 for bills that took effect in April 2025.

I could never do it, but ‘wellbeing days’ do sound niceThu 9 Oct 2025 08.55 EDTLast modified on Thu 9 Oct 2025 15.08 EDTShareIf you want to get rich, a friend of mine said recently, set up an exam centre. We were talking about her decision to home school – or unschool, or home educate, depending on your tribal affiliation – her two children, making her simultaneously part of a broader trend and also somewhat strange to herself. The cliche of home schooling still leans on the idea of a fringe choice made by fanatical parents who produce a poorly socialised child – if you said of a child: “They’re home schooled”, you’d trigger a knowing look that implied: “Say no more.”Well – maybe – all that is changing. Home schooling is still fringe, but the numbers are soaring. In 2024, UK councils received66,000 notificationsof children moving to education at home, more than double the number from 2020 andbringing up the totalto some 111,700 children in England. Given that there are roughly 9 million school-age children in England alone, this still represents a tiny proportion. But the leap – which is subject to large regional swings: the number of home-schooled kids has more than tripled in the north-east and hasrisen by 85%in the east of England – is significant, not least because it seems to encompass families that in a million years would not have imagined themselves taking this path.I spoke to two parents, one in London, one in Yorkshire, both of whom moved their kids to home schooling after or towards the end of primary school, both of whom are loving it, albeit sheepishly, and neither of whom believes it is prohibitively difficult. Both are atypical to some extent, since neither was acting for religious or health reasons, or in response to failures in the threadbarespecial educational needs and disabilities(Send) provision in state schools, traditionally the primary motivators for pulling kids out of mainstream school. To both I wanted to ask: how can you stand it? The staying across the curriculum, the never getting time off and – chiefly – the teaching of maths, which presumably entails you having to do some maths?Tyan Jones, in London, has a son turning 14 who would be inyear 9and a 10-year-old girl who would be finishing up primary school. Instead they are both at home, where Jones oversees their learning. Her eldest son left school after year 6 when he didn’t get into a single one of his requested high schools in a London borough where the choices aren’t great. Her daughter left year 3 a few years later after her son’s departure seemed to work out. She is a single parent who runs her own business and can be flexible around when she works. This is the main thing about home schooling, she says: it permits a form of “concentrated learning” that allows you to determine your own schedule – in the case of her family, doing 9am to 2.30pm “school” days Monday through Wednesday, then taking a four-day weekend during which Jones “works like crazy” at her actual job while the kids do clubs and extracurriculars and all the stuff that keeps them up with their friends.It’s the friends thing that parents of kids in school tend to round on as the starkest perceived downside to home learning. How does a kid learn to negotiate with difficult people, or weather conflict, when they’re in a class size of one? The parents I spoke to said removing their kids from school didn’t entail dropping their friendships, and that with the right out-of-school activities – Jones’s son goes to orchestra on a Saturday and she is, shrewdly, careful to organise meet-ups for him in which he is thrown in with kids he doesn’t particularly like – the same socialisation can occur as within school walls.I mean, to me it sounds like hell. But talking to Jones – who says that if her daughter feels like having a “reading day” or “a complete day of cello”, then she goes ahead and permits it – I can see the appeal. Not everyone does. So strong are the feelings triggered by people making choices for their kids that you might not make for your own that my friend in Yorkshire a) asks to remain anonymous and b) says she has actually lost friends by deciding to home school her kids. “It’s weird how hostile people are,” she says – and this is before you get to the hostility between factions within the home-schooling world, some of which reject the term “home schooling” because it centres the word “school”. (“We’re not into that crowd,” she says drily.)Inside the school refusal crisis: how a mother and her daughters survived a broken systemRead moreThey are atypical in other ways too: her 15-year-old daughter and 19-year-old son are so highly motivated that her son, earlier on in his teens, bought all the textbooks himself, got up before 5am each day to study, knocked 10 GCSEs out of the park a year early and has now returned to sixth form, where he is on course for top grades for all his A-levels (he took some time out before sixth form to be sure that going back to school was what he wanted to do). “He was a boy who loved ballet and the Brontës and hated football – he didn’t fit in at secondary school,” says my friend, who is an artist married to a teacher. Her daughter, meanwhile, was “quiet at school” but has flourished at home, and combines ploughing through the curriculum with a day of dance and youth theatre a week. “I’m upstairs painting,” says my friend while her kids effectively self-educate between textbooks, YouTube videos and the occasional maths tutor.I couldn’t do it. I think I know this about myself. During the pandemic, when I was up against a deadline to finish writing a book, my five-year-olds spent six weeks almost exclusively on TikTok and did none of the school worksheets. If you’re a corporate lawyer or someone who works shifts in retail, it’s not doable without outside help either. But if you can pull it off, says Jones, “it’s less stressful than school. My favourite day is Thursday, a ‘wellbeing day’, when we clean the house, the kids do all the cooking, and we chat and chill.” When my friend in Yorkshire first pulled her kids out of school, she was full of guilt and panic. “Oh my gosh, what am I doing?” But here’s what she discovered: that if your kids “don’t fit the mould”, there is another option, and it’s not as hard as you think.“There’s more time to be alive,” she says of the way they have figured things out – and that includes the one thing parents with kids in school dream of: taking holidays in term time at a fraction of the cost.Emma Brockes is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsHome schoolingOpinionSchoolsChildrenYoung peopleFamilycommentShareReuse this content"

Tragedy after tragedy, it can’t go onJeremy HuntUntil staff are unafraid to be open about genuine mistakes, however devastating, nothing will be learned – and nothing will changeThu 9 Oct 2025 06.01 EDTLast modified on Thu 9 Oct 2025 11.52 EDTShareLucian Leape, a pioneer in patient safety, once said the single greatest impediment to error prevention in the medical industry is that “we punish people for making mistakes.”He was right. In my experience as health secretary, the biggest barrier to safer care in theNHSwasn’t a lack of expertise or dedication. It wasn’t – by the end – a lack of money or even clinicians. It was a blame culture that stopped people being open about mistakes. That prevents professionals from learning from tragedies and condemns the system to repeating them.At the start of Baby Loss Awareness Week, we should remember that the number of tragedies remains heartbreaking. Including stillbirths, there are 4870 baby deathsevery year in the UK– around 13 every day. Some of these would have happened with the best of care, but many more could have been avoided. And every single one leaves behind devastated parents who must do what no human being should ever have to do – bury their own child.Eleven babies died needlessly in theMorecambe Bay scandal. Since I stood up in parliament to respond to the Kirkup investigation in 2015, the NHS has worked hard to learn the hard lessons involved – and progress has been made. Between 2013 and 2023, perinatal mortality in England and Walesfell by around 20%– the equivalent of more than two fewer a day.But since the pandemic, the picture is more mixed. Maternal deaths, although thankfully still rare, have risen and remain much more likely for Black and Asian mothers. Having completed her inquiry into Shrewsbury and Telford, Donna Ockenden is nowlooking into deathsat the Nottingham university hospitals NHS trust. Across England, two-thirds of maternity units are still rated by the CQC as “requires improvement” or “inadequate”. Many families are particularly worried about possible poor care in Leeds, so anew rapid national investigation, under the leadership of Valerie Amos, is looking into maternity safety across the NHS, including a deep dive into services at 10 trusts.If England and Wales matched the baby death rate in Japan, almost two fewer babies would die every day. Closer to home, if wematched Sweden, one fewer would die every day.Both have made great progress in tackling a blame culture that stops vital learning from happening. In Sweden there is no-fault compensation following medical error. Clinicians are wholly accountable, but because the system is not looking for a perpetrator, space is created for honest learning. It is not perfect, but it does avoid adversarial confrontation. Court cases that drag on for five years or more are almost unheard of.View image in fullscreenJoshua Titcombe with his sister Emily.Photograph: PAThe UK is rather different. According to the 2024 NHS staff survey, more than a third of staff don’t feel comfortable speaking up about safety concerns. Even if they want to be open and transparent, the system makes it difficult. Many worry they will be scapegoated by their organisation. Lawyers get involved. Families feel shut out. And the result is that the most important thing of all does not happen: understanding any failures so that system-wide improvements can be put in place to stop the same thing happening again.It doesn’t have to be this way. One of the babies who died at Morecambe Bay was Joshua Titcombe.Years later,his father, James, met one of the midwives involved. She had missed crucial opportunities to escalate concerns and had been suspended from practice. James knew there was no malice – she had been doing what seemed right to her at the time. But he still felt angry: her later statements conflicted with his family’s experience.But in that meeting, something extraordinary happened. The midwife spoke of how she still thought about Joshua, that she wished she had acted differently, and that she was deeply sorry.They ended up crying together. Supported afterwards, she returned to practice. James is certain she will not make the same mistakes again. Honesty and forgiveness don’t just heal – they lead to safer care.If we want to break the cycles of fear and blame that are so common at the moment, we need to reform a system that often means a bereaved family’s only friend is their lawyer. The primary focus of the law is – rightly – justice, but we should not rely on it to improve patient safety. We now spend much more settling litigation claims for baby harm and death every year than theentire cost of NHS maternity services.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

That would be far more consistent with NHS values – and by allowing learning to happen, save countless lives in the process. When Japan did something similar to Sweden for children born with severe cerebral palsy, the number of cases dropped by a quarterin just four years.This is not an argument to exonerate clinicians who deliberately harm patients or fail to learn from mistakes they make. Healthcare professionals don’t go to work to cause harm, but good intentions alone are not enough: competence, behaviour and integrity matter as they do in all professions. But a constructive, just culture should distinguish between professional negligence and the ordinary human mistakes any of us can make. Accountability is not the same as blame. Until we distinguish between the two, tragedies will carry on being repeated.Jeremy Hunt served as secretary of state for health, later secretary of state for health and social care, from 2012 to 2018Explore more on these topicsInfant and child mortalityOpinionNHSChildrenParents and parentingHealthMedicinecommentShareReuse this content"

In one of hisvideos, viewed more than half a million times, the pint-sized pooch stares defiantly at the camera and responds to an empty packet of treats by pressing the “I don’t give a damn” button. Followed by the “bitch” button. Bad dog, Mr Waffles.Then, last month, researchers reported that some dogscan mentally categorise their toys depending on their use.“Fetch toys” can be distinguished from “tug of war toys”, and retrieved appropriately.I’m a dog owner. I fully admit to being one of thethird of Britonswho would rather talk to their pets than to people. At first glance, the study seems to confirm what I already knew – that my dog understands everythingthat I say – but while interactions like this tell us something about how smart dogs are, they barely scrape the surface of their communicative abilities.In recent years, many parallels have been drawn between animal communication and human language. We have learned, for example, that some animals have names that they use for each other. Elephants useparticular vocalisations– harmonically rich, low-frequency sounds – to address key members of their group. “Hey, Dave, over here!”A dialogue with your pets? Do you really want a cat to say you look dog-rough today? | Coco KhanRead moreIn their early months of life, bottlenose dolphins invent their own unique “signature whistle”, which goes on to become the name that others use to call them. During this same time period, mother dolphins communicate with their youngsters using “motherese”. Just like human mums, they adjust the frequency and pitch of the sounds they make to a create a singsong tone thought to facilitate bonding.Meanwhile, songbirds havedifferent regional dialects, meaning the sparrows near me sing with the avian equivalent of a Birmingham accent – “All right, bab!”And sperm whales, which use “names” andaccents, have recently been shown to have their ownphonetic alphabet. The gentle giants communicate with patterns of clicks. By altering their rhythm, tempo, duration and number, simple units of sound can be combined to generate complexity. According to the scientists who discovered the phenomenon, this is similar to the way that humans combine sounds to form words.Whenever these stories break, they are met with surprise. “Aren’t animals clever?! Who’d have thought it?!” But none of this should be surprising. All of these animals live deeply complex, rich and social lives. Sperm whales, for example,live in tight-knit female-led groups, which sometimes come together to form larger groups known as “vocal clans”. They hunt together, babysit for each other and work together to see off predatory orcas. Of course they have complex communication. They need it for survival.The mistake, however, is to presume – a priori – that animal communication is anything like ours. All too often we try to crowbar animal communication into a human-centric framework, but it’s like trying to fit a square peg in a round hole. We’ll never solve the puzzle, because there will always be a fundamental mismatch.Just as a cuttlefish would miss the subtlety of human sarcasm, so too humans are unlikely ever to understand the full spectrum of cuttlefish communication. When they dynamically change the patterning and colour of their skin, it’s fascinating, but alien. Different animals communicate in different ways. Sure they use sound, but they also use colour, smell,electricity,vibrationsand the medium ofexpressive dance. There is an abundance of animal communication that we miss because we don’t have the sensory organs or humility to detect it.Human language – with names and words and syntax and grammar – is just one solution that one species has evolved to help it navigate the challenges that it faces. Non-human animals live different lives with different struggles. If we really want to grasp what animals are “saying”, we need to understand their communication on their terms, not ours.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Through careful observation, she uncovered a wealth of previously unrecognised complexity, including the discovery that chimps communicate using body language as well as sound.Contemporary ethologists have built on this. The work ofCat Hobaiter from the University of St Andrewsshows that chimps have a rich repertoire of gestures that they use for close-up communication. They don’t have “words”,but they do have flexible articulate signals that have meaning. So, when a chimp makes an audibly loud, long, slow scratch, it canmean “groom me”, but it can also mean “let’s travel”. And while they may not have specific gestures or calls for different types of food, such as figs or seeds, maybe they don’t need them. What humans and chimps consider useful information is different.So, instead of marvelling at the ability of pooches to press word buttons, take time instead to marvel at the way dogs communicate with dogs.

But Mike Johnson is defying the will of the votersThu 9 Oct 2025 10.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 9 Oct 2025 10.31 EDTShareThe people of Arizona’s seventh congressional district – a vast territory extending across the state’s south, along the Mexican border – have been denied representation in Congress for weeks. That’s because Mike Johnson, the Republican House speaker, hasrefused to swear inAdelita Grijalva, their representative-elect, who won a special election to fill the seat vacated by her father, the late Raúl Grijalva, in a landslide late last month. Grijalva, a Democrat, has been largely ignored by the speaker. Unlike sworn representatives, she has togo around the Capitol with an escort. There’s an office with her name on the door, but she hasn’t been allowed inside, and has worked insteadout of a conference roomon another floor.It is an unprecedented abuse of procedural power on the part of the speaker, one that has had the effect of silencing a political opponent and denying representation to the citizens of her district. In refusing to seat Grijalva, Johnson has defied the will of Arizona’s voters, and effectively nullified, at least for the time being, a legitimate congressional election. He has persisted in this even in defiance of his own promises, after saying on Friday he would seat her this week once the House returned to session – andthen telling lawmakersthey wouldn’t reconvene this week after all. Last week, Grijalva showed up to a three-and-a-half-minute pro forma session, hoping to be sworn in then. (Johnson has sworn inother representativesat pro forma sessions in the past.) But the Republican presiding over the session, Morgan Griffith,ignored the effort. On a weekend talkshow, Grijalva said she had heard “absolutely nothing” from the speaker about the timing of her swearing in.Grijalva thinks she knows why. There is no political calculation that could justify Mike Johnson’s refusal to seat a duly elected member of the House: Grijalva won her race, and both his oath to the constitution and his responsibilities to the body that he leads require Johnson to seat her. But in lieu of deference to these higher aims, Grijalva suspects that Johnson is pursuing a much more cynical one: in refusing to swear her in and allow her to take up the office to which she has been elected, Johnson, Grijalva thinks, is aiming to stop her becoming the final member of Congress whose signature is needed toforce a voteon the release of confidential files related to Jeffrey Epstein. Currently, the petition has 217 signatures; it needs only 218. Grijalva has pledged to support it. “Why the rules are different for me – the only thing that I can think of is the Epstein files,” Grijalva told theNew York Times.The Epstein scandal, and the ensuing fallout from new and resurfaced revelations about Donald Trump’s deep and longstanding friendship with the deceased child sex trafficker and financier, has long plagued the Trump administration. One of the few genuine threats to Trump’s grip over his coalition came a few months ago, when hisjustice department refused to releasefiles relating to the case, causing outrage among a group of rightwing podcasters, media personalities and conspiracy theorists who had long traded on speculation about the case and accusations that powerful Democrats were involved in a cover-up.The discharge petition, if passed, would not be likely to result in the actual release of the documents. The move has little support in the Republican-backed Senate; there is no chance that Donald Trump, who has opposed the release of the Epstein files, calling them a“waste” of “time and energy”, would sign a bill into law making them public. But what the move would accomplish is forcing a full chamber vote on the matter, requiring every member of the Republican caucus to go on the record either endorsing the release of the files – and thereby displeasing Trump – or opposing it – thereby displeasing their voters. The Timeshas reportedthat Johnson’s delay is giving the White House more time to pressure Republicans who have already signed on to the discharge petition to remove their signatures before the Grijalva is sworn in.And so it seems that Johnson is ignoring the constitution and subverting the will of the voters in order to buy time, in an effort to spare his party embarrassment over their president’s one-time close confidence with a pedophile.But the refusal to seat Grijalva has broader implications. In using his procedural control over the functioning of Congress to deny a seat to an elected Democrat, Johnson is setting a dangerous precedent and raising questions about future transfers of power. If a Democratic majority is elected in 2026, will the outgoing Republican speaker duly swear in its members? Or will he use his procedural powers to delay one, several or many of them from taking their oaths of office – either under the pretext of election fraud or personal ineligibility, or out of sheer, bald unwillingness to hand over power to members of a party that the president and his allies have repeatedly described as illegitimate?These are no longer fanciful questions; they are ones that must be asked. The Republicans whorefused to subvert the lawfor Trump’s benefit on January 6 are now largely gone; the ones who have replaced them appear much more willing to place party before country. Every day that Grijalva is not sworn in, the shadow they cast over 2026 darkens.Moira Donegan is a Guardian US columnistExplore more on these topicsHouse of RepresentativesOpinionMike JohnsonJeffrey EpsteinArizonaDemocratsUS politicsRepublicanscommentShareReuse this content"

It means everyone’s analysis of the game is fundamentally superficialThu 9 Oct 2025 09.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 9 Oct 2025 15.08 EDTShareAcouple of weeks ago, Liverpool were on course to win the Premier League for the second season running and probably the Champions League too. After ManchesterCity briefly won the title on the opening daywhen Tijjani Reijnders tore Wolves apart, the Reds’ run of winning without being that good made it feel inevitable. Winning when not at your best is, after all, a sign (™) of a title-winning side, Clive.But thenLiverpoolcontinued playing not particularly well and started losing. At the same time the perennially second-placed high-performance cowards Arsenal have an excellent defence and at least two very good players in every position. Arise Sir Mikel.Diogo Jota gave Liverpool fans goals and a glorious song. He will never be forgotten | Sachin NakraniRead moreIt is almost as if things can change during a season. It really would be better all round to wait until it is finished and review everything then. But that would be a very long podcast. Gary Neville and Jamie Carragher might get through a couple of pairs of thick white-soled pundit shoes by the time they had broken everything down on the one episode of MondayTuesdayWednesday Night Football at the end of May.Do three defeats in succession constitute a crisis? As with any football debate it depends entirely on your definition of the key word in the sentence. Is Paul Scholes world class? What do you mean by world class? Are Aston Villa a big club? What does big mean? Are Manchester United back? OK, well, we know the answer to that one.But for a club of Liverpool’s size, given how good they were last season, mini-crisis seems about right. On TalkSport last week beforethe Chelsea game, I asked their former striker Neil Mellor how many defeats in a row before he starts panicking. He replied six. For the record, we are halfway towards a Neil Mellor panic.How that manifests itself we will have to see. But if you see a genial blond 42-year-old man running around Alderley Edge Waitrose (just an educated guess) screaming at a Charlie Bigham lasagne, you’ll know Liverpool have lost to Manchester United, Eintracht Frankfurt and Brentford.There are clear problems. Trying to incorporate Florian Wirtz, who you can tell is such a delightful player, has imbalanced the midfield. Those who watch a lot of the Bundesliga (ie Archie Rhind-Tutt and Lars Sivertsen) will tell you that Wirtz is a touch player, who makes those around him better. He links the play effortlessly, as opposed to “grabbing the game by the scruff of the neck”.This is clearly more difficult if you’re not used to the players around you. Milos Kerkez and Jeremie Frimpong are different footballers to Andy Robertson and Trent Alexander-Arnold.There are also a number of players who shone last season who are not performing as well: Mo Salah, Ibrahima Konaté, Alexis Mac Allister, Conor Bradley. In fact, almost all of them. There is one glaring thing all these people have endured in the very recent past –the death of Diogo Jota.View image in fullscreenMohamed Salah has not performed at the same standard as last season for Liverpool.Photograph: David Klein/Action Images/ReutersIt is just over three months since they lost their friend. While the news cycle moves on so fast and our pie chart of compassion that we reserve for beyond our own bubble focused on that for a few days before going back to Gaza, Ukraine, ICE, the Manchester terror attack, etc, etc, all the while these guys are going to work and their mate isn’t there.It is impossible to know how each Liverpool player and staff member is feeling on any given day and there is a great deal of projection. Perhaps Salah didn’t track back against Chelsea because he couldn’t be bothered or he was tired. But possibly his form is just a few per cent down because he misses his pal.It was interesting to hear Enzo Maresca talking before the Chelsea-Liverpool game about the loss of his teammate Antonio Puerta at Sevilla, who had a cardiac arrest on the pitch in a game against Getafe in August 2007 and died in hospital three days later at the age of 22.“The way they are doing this season is fantastic,” Chelsea’s head coach said. “Especially after Jota’s tragedy.

So you have to be very strong. And this is the reason why for me they are doing not good, even better than good. Because they are trying to deal with a problem that is not easy.”On The Anfield Wrap, Craig Hannan summed it up very well: “They’re still going to be reminded when they hear the song on 20 minutes, when they walk into the dressing room and there’s no one under his hanger. Even during games there’s going to moments when they play a ball and think: ‘Ah well Diogo …’ If Salah’s cried six games ago in front of the Kop it means that just everything isn’t all right now.”View image in fullscreenLiverpool fans hold up a banner in tribute to Diogo Jota.Photograph: Robbie Jay Barratt/AMA/Getty ImagesI have come to believe over the course of covering football for a couple of decades that there is a fundamental superficiality to everyone’s analysis of the game. We do not know how any individual is feeling at any given time and what effect that is having on their performance. Jota’s death is one of the starkest examples. We know something terrible happened and we understand what grief is. Beyond that is the intangible level to which this is affecting different people at the club. There is a high chance some of the players themselves don’t really know its effect at any given time.How the media cover this and how fans dissect performances are clearly not hugely important. At a practical level, if you bring up Jota’s death, it is hard to do it in 10 seconds and then move on to Dominik Szoboszlai’s difficulties at right-back. Beyond this tragedy and beyond Liverpool, it would sound bizarre to caveat every criticism of every player with an admission that we know so little about them, be it their relationship with their parents, if they are going through IVF, if their marriage is breaking down or whatever.The Guardian Football Weekly regular Nedum Onuoha was on Radio 5 Live the other day talking about how his mother’s death halfway through his career affected his love of the game. “I didn’t enjoy football as much. Some of the highs and the lows that come with it didn’t really feel the same any more.” And that’s half a career; with Jota and Liverpool right now, it is three months.So whatever they achieve, if it’s something or if it’s nothing, even if we don’t mention it every time we discuss their games, even if it isn’t the reason they go on to do whatever they go on to do, we should not forget that a few weeks ago they lost not just a brilliant footballer, but more importantly, they lost a friend.Explore more on these topicsLiverpoolDiogo JotacommentShareReuse this content"

But a long-term solution remains distantThu 9 Oct 2025 13.36 EDTLast modified on Thu 9 Oct 2025 15.07 EDTShareDonald Trump called thepause in hostilitieshe has brokered the first step to a “strong, durable and everlasting peace”. No one can do more to determine the outcome than the US president. This was, for him, a modest statement, acknowledging that Israel and Hamas had agreed to the first phase of his plan – it being their decision, not his, to break a multi-point agreement into a multi-stage discussion. Two parties so far apart agreed on one thing: both would ratherdefer the really difficult issues.In Israel and Gaza,there was joy– however tentative – at the announcement. An end to the annihilation, the release of all hostages and the resumption of large-scale aid have all been desperately needed. There is every reason to fear that thiswill not lead to a lasting peace, and every reason to strive to ensure that it does. In finally reining in Benjamin Netanyahu, and in offering Qatar a security guarantee that persuaded it (with Egypt and Turkey) to lean more heavily upon Hamas, Mr Trump has created an opportunity which must be seized.To recognise that his intercession has brought this ceasefire is also to acknowledge that Mr Trump, and Mr Biden before him, could have ended this conflict long ago. More than three dozen of the hostages taken byHamas-led militantson 7 October 2023are believed to have been killed in captivity. More than 67,000 Palestinians have been killed by the Israeli military in Gaza. The tens of thousands of children who have been orphaned or aresuffering acute malnutritionoffer some indication of how profound and lasting the damage will be.TheHamasatrocities of 7 October, and the genocide in Gaza, have pushed both Israelis and Palestinians towards seeing the underlying conflict as, more than ever, an existential struggle. Hostilities could easily resume – though for now, at least, both Hamas and the Israeli government seem to believe that a deal will be better for them than continuing the conflict.Hamas has no desire to disarm. The bulk of Mr Trump’s plan says that Israel will not occupy or annex Gaza, but offers Palestinians in essence a colonial administration under Mr Trump and Sir Tony Blair, with only the wispiest suggestion that they might prove themselves deserving of statehood in the future. Mr Netanyahu has already rejected that.Israel’s prisoner release will not include the highly popularMarwan Barghouti, jailed for ordering murders in the second intifada and seen by many as the figure most capable of bringing Palestinian factions together. Mr Trump may not remain invested in this crisis for long once he has taken his victory lap. Strikingly, the breakthrough came shortly before theNobel peace prizeis to be announced, on Friday (though the committee held its last meeting on Monday).Emmanuel Macron, whose diplomatic initiatives helped pave the way for this moment, stressed on Thursday that it should lead to a political outcome based on the two-state solution. The growing international pressure upon Israel, itself a reflection of public opinion’s impact upon the governments of its allies, and the increased involvement of the region, were critical. The temptation for Israel’s allies now may be to ease off, acting as if this short-term fix were a solution. They must instead invest intensified effort to produce the strong and durable peace of which Mr Trump spoke – which will only be feasible if it is founded on justice.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The UK-wide parties should watch outThu 9 Oct 2025 13.35 EDTLast modified on Thu 9 Oct 2025 15.07 EDTShareViewed through the Westminster prism, UK electoral politics seems a five-party contest. The narrative has been well aired in the conference season. The three established parties – Labour, Conservatives and Liberal Democrats – are each battling to peg back the Reform UK surge, with the Greens hovering in the wings. In Scotland and Wales, however, there are different pictures that the Westminster prism does not see. In both countries, the UK parties still fight their corners. Yet the main nationalist parties – the Scottish National party and Plaid Cymru – are reaping the benefit. In Scotland, the SNP has a clearpolling lead, while in Wales, Plaid ishead-to-headwith Reform UK. Caught between the two, the established parties find themselves battling for survival.With the nationalists holding their respective annual conferences this weekend, and crucial elections next spring to the devolved parliaments, observers across the UK need to be clear. Much of the political wind in 2026 will blow from the north and the west. Next year, both the SNP andPlaid Cymrucould be government parties, a familiar role for the former, but a spectacular turnaround for the latter.Plaid’s rise means its Swanseaconferenceis a pivotal opportunity for the party under its leader,Rhun ap Iorwerth. Plaid owes its recent rise to many things, including a sluggish economy, UK Labour’s unpopularity, and Welsh Labour’s lacklustrerecord. A Seneddbyelectionon 23 October in Caerphilly, a seat Labour has never lost, will be a bellwether of the wider mood, and of Plaid’s appeal in the valleys.You have to go back to 1918 to find an all-Wales election in which Labour did not come first. Labour has also won every time the Senedd has been contested, as it will be again in May. Yet, if the most recentWales-wide pollholds good, that is set to change. Plaid will instead be the largest party, just ahead of Reform UK, with Labour third. Though still a minority, Plaid would be in government. In Welsh terms, that would be a political earthquake. Perhaps in Britain-wide terms too.An SNP victory in May’s Holyrood contest would hardly be an earthquake, after 18 continuous years of nationalist government. It would, though, signal a remarkable comeback froma period of eclipse, and from an often dismal record on public services. For Labour, which did so well in Scotland in the 2024 general election, it would signal a crisis moment, imperilling Sir Keir Starmer’s leadership.A fifth SNP term could put independence back on the agenda, too, with the party arguing that a separate Scotland is the best way to escape Nigel Farage. The SNP’s John Swinney published a newindependence proposalthis week. Although mainly aimed at the party’s debates in Aberdeen thisweekend, events after May could give his ideas another lift. Support for independence isalready on 47%. It might not take much more to tip the balance the SNP’s way.Both nationalist parties scent victory. But the two movements march to the beat of different drums. Plaid has re-emerged as an as-yet untarnished centre-left alternative to Labour and the right. By contrast, the SNP is doing well in the polls in spite of its record. The Scottish Social Attitudessurveypublished this week found only 22% satisfied with the NHS, while trust in devolution is also down. Neither party looks set for majority government. As rival parties have also found, winning the support of unhappy voters may prove easier than putting the party visions into practice.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Similar proposals werevoted downby the House of Lords as a late amendment at report stage of the public order bill inJanuary 2023. It is unlikely that their lordships will be any more welcoming of these plans this time.First, the announcement came only a few days after the closure of an invitation-only consultation; the speed indicates an already made-up mind. Second, part of the case for expansion of powers is the need to deal with protests that intimidate local people in an area, yet the power to impose conditions on the basis of planned intimidation has existed in public order law since 1986.There is also a raft of other provisions that already empower the police to regulate protests: those based on serious disruption to the local community, those based on significant noise, powers to disperse based on reasonable grounds to think that there will be harassment, alarm or distress, and powers to deal with individuals who incite hatred based on race or religion.Lastly, as with all police discretionary powers, is the risk of overreach and of chilling the lawful speech of others. One real danger is that one protest group might be denied their rights because of the actions (say the previous day) of another group. That calls into question the individual nature of the right and the need for individualised assessment of risks and harms for restrictions to be proportionate.Prof David Mead, Dr Suzanne Dixon, Dr Charmian Werren andJack JonesUniversity of East Anglia Law SchoolI have thought deeply about Owen Jones’ article (It starts with Palestine protests. But where will the crackdown on Britain’s democratic freedoms end?, 6 October).I was arrested on Saturday withhundreds of othersat the Defend Our Juries action in Trafalgar Square, against genocide and the proscription of Palestine Action. It was also the 89th anniversary of the arrest of my father for being one of the organisers of the 1936Cable Streetresistance to the rise of fascism in Britain.Besides the obligatory “I oppose genocide, I support Palestine action”, I carried an extra placard saying: “This Jew abhors the Gaza genocide and the Manchester synagogue attack.”Calling opposition to genocide antisemitic is always ignorant and sometimes wicked. My willingness to fight antisemitism, seared into my soul as a child born three months before the liberation of Auschwitz, leads me to stand against emerging fascism, and the genocide that the far-right Israeli government has unleashed.The same core ethics spur my horror at Israel’s apartheid regime, the brutal killings on 7 October 2023 and the indiscriminate and repeated massacres in the two years since.My dad would have been horrified by the 13 September far-right rally in Westminster organised by Tommy Robinson and even more so by hissubsequent invitationto Israel as a heroic defender of Jews, by a Likud minister. This has been opposed even by the staunchly Zionist Board of Deputies of British Jews.The vast majority of those who march to oppose genocide or act against it oppose all racism. There is work to be done replacing a government that partners genocide and suppresses protest, not with the repressive Faragist right, but a progressive movement demanding justice and promoting peace.Prof Tony BoothCambridgeHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

When Labour came to power, I felt tremendous relief and a budding sense of safety and optimism. I soon learned how naive I was. Betrayed and used, I now fear that I will lose my job and my home.TheLabourparty must come to its senses. First, immigrants already here must be allowed to apply for indefinite leave to remain (ILR) under the law as it was when we came into the country. This is only fair to our employers and us. Second, the health and care visa must remain. Think of your loved ones in need of care. Third, the time needed to get ILR and citizenship must not be increased. It is far better to have an island of strangers than one of corpses. Finally, visa fees must not be increased. We earn very little, and many struggle to pay visa renewal fees. If the NHS and councils lose much of their immigrant workforce and are made to pay higher visa-sponsorship fees for twice as long, they will be seriously affected.Florence GrahamLondonHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

The British prime minister has flown to Mumbai with the largest trade delegation ever and unlike previous slightly dodgy ones from the 1700s that went for spices and tea, he’s gone to Yash Raj Films – one of Bollywood’s biggest studios, with the hope of creating a new genre: BollyBrit.Singing, dancing, the stiff upper lip. Never before in cinema history have these combined. And for good reason.That’s why, when Starmer initially announced that three newBollywoodproductions would be shot in the UK, film-makers here in Mumbai shrugged, assuming it was just about location. Just another trio among the hundreds made every year in India.Given the general hassles of shooting in any Indian location (people staring, infrastructure nightmares, bribes et al), locations in the UK have doubled up forIndiamany a time, as some sort of brilliant reverse colonial joke.Blenheim Palace, Winston Churchill’s birthplace, became a girls’ college in north India (inKabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham). The same film featured Waddesdon Manor in Aylesbury as a rich Delhi man’s private home and Paddington has many a time become an Indian train station. The great irony that the Mumbai train station, originally English-built as Victoria terminus, was replaced by a London train station to look more like modern India, is enough to drive any postcolonial observer mad.Sadly, unlike Indian food, Bollywood stories, beyond the extravagant Punjabi wedding dancing sequences, haven’t permeated into mainstream UK stories, except among British Asians. So it is very possible that as I write this, a primary school in Margate is doubling up as aMumbaitax office in a noir-musical-comedy-action-thriller-mystery-horror-romcom, unknown to British cinephiles.However, this isn’t about location any more.Starmer is in Mumbai along with representatives of key British entertainment companies, including BFI, Pinewood Studios, and the British Film Commission, to discuss collaborations that could possibly go beyond locations and create a genre mashup. It shouldn’t be long before two very different cinematic styles come together – one reserved, witty, quiet, real, researched, and the other melodramatic, talky, implausible, geographically vague.It is what the world is waiting for. The days of waffling about with Slumdog Millionaire, Merchant Ivory, Best Exotic Marigold Hotel, where the cultures brush gently and respectfully, in a recognised genre, are over. BollyBrit’s purpose is not to satisfy but confound. Too many viewers ask: “How did they make this?” It is time to ask: “What is it?”What screenplays of mass entertainment Bollywood films do very well, is have you suspend disbelief to a point where you don’t believe this is a movie. That’s a sort of artistic nirvana one needs to aspire to. For example, a film that starts out as a spy thriller, might become a mythology lesson, digress into a superhero CGI spectacle, and end with a patriotic song, all the while advertised as a whodunnit.British films, in contrast, are about one thing. For example, Bill Nighy in a typical prestige drama set in war-ravaged post Edwardian London, mumbling Pinter-esque subtext to his unrequited love to Helen Mirren, is a kind of film where you know they’ve suppressed feelings for 50 years, and it’ll end in a Brief Encounter sort of way, with a sad unspoken parting. Why not suddenly have a whole chorus show up in the climax, of gen Z Indian Instagram influencers, plus Ed Sheeran, singing “She loves you, you idiot”. The principals could sing, “We didn’t know” and many costume changes, a romance and musical could ensue. Clarity helps. I can’t wait.Anuvab Palis a British-Indian comedian and screenwriter.

It was possible to remember the words of the Wales manager asEnglandsurged into a 3-0 lead inside 20 minutes. It felt like a technical knockout, this friendly over with indecent haste.Thomas Tuchel had stood by the players who had ignited his England tenure in September with the5-0 World Cup qualifying winagainst Serbia in Belgrade, the buildup dominated by his omissions of Jude Bellingham, in particular, and Phil Foden. The manager simply wanted his team to build on the momentum they had generated, the excitement they created.‘The stadium was silent’: Tuchel critical of England support during Wales winRead moreIt was not as if Wembley was electrified, the Super Tommy Tuchel energy coursing everywhere.Waleswere so poor in the first half that it did not feel like a fair fight. But there was still plenty for Tuchel to like ahead of the trip to play Latvia in Riga on Tuesday when his team could seal automatic qualification to the World Cup.It was not a night when Bellingham or Foden were missed. Morgan Rogers made sure of that, excelling in the No 10 role. He opened the scoring with his first England goal and set up the second for Ollie Watkins, who played in place of the injured Harry Kane. Bukayo Saka was good, too, adding one of his specials for the third and that was basically that.Wales, at least, roused themselves and they went close to a goal in the final stages which would have delighted their vociferous fans, who stayed until the bitter end – unlike their England counterparts. They sloped off long before full time. They had seen enough.It was easy to fear for Wales in the early running – from the moment that Anthony Gordon was allowed so much space inside the area to work Karl Darlow. Bellamy had pledged to play on the front foot and he went with a strong lineup ahead of Monday’s crucial qualifying tie against Belgium in Cardiff.But his players were meek, some of their efforts in the duels powder puff, embarrassing. England toyed with them, repeatedly getting in behind and they tore into a three-goal advantage. The manner of the concessions were galling for Bellamy, his plans laid to waste.View image in fullscreenMorgan Rogers opens the scoring for England from close range in the third minute.Photograph: Marc Atkins/Getty ImagesThe most interesting selection for Tuchel was probably John Stones, who he was able to play for the first time. Tuchel shunted Ezri Konsa to right-back in order to accommodate Stones alongside Marc Guéhi. Both centre-halves were involved in the breakthrough, the former getting his head to a Declan Rice corner and Guéhi doing well to stretch and keep the ball in on the byline. Wales assumed he would not reach it and stopped. Guéhi pinged it back for Rogers, whose first-time shot was marked by nonchalance.The second goal was even worse from a Wales point of view. England had men over at the far post when Saka crossed from the inside left and it was Rogers rather than Rice who sent over a short-range lob. Guéhi could not score but Watkins had the time to control at the far post, allow the ball to drop and then touch home from one yard.When the third went in, there was one obvious question after David Brooks had shown Saka inside and watched him bend a trademark left-footed curler into the far top corner; a lovely finish. Had he never seen Saka play before?A penny for Bellamy’s thoughts at the interval. Actually, they were not difficult to imagine. Gordon subjected Neco Williams to a torrid first 45 minutes, all speed and slippery skills but the Wales right-back was hardly alone in going awol. Rogers had fun in between the lines; Welsh resistance was conspicuous only by its absence.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Saka was denied by a Joe Rodon block after running up the inside right channel at 2-0 while Watkins was guilty of a grisly miss in the 40th minute, slicing off target from Elliot Anderson’s blast across the face of goal.Marcus Rashford has good memories of playing Wales. Hescored two in the 3-0 winover them at the Qatar World Cup and Tuchel got him on for Watkins at the start of the second half. He asked Rashford to work off the left and switched Gordon into a central attacking role, with Rogers in support.Tuchel did not want England’s levels to drop. He had a mini melt-down when Gordon, having won possession and streaked clear up the inside right, could not execute the cross to Rashford, who was free in front of goal. Saka then cut Wales open for Rogers to hit the crossbar, although Rice was offside in the buildup.What was this on 56 minutes? A Wales shot and a good one, too, Brooks’ volley forcing Jordan Pickford to save with his feet. England did drop off in the closing stages and Wales restored a measure of pride by pushing for a consolation goal, which they almost got.One substitute, Chris Mepham, extended Pickford with a header while another, Mark Harris, nodded over from close range, although he looked to have fouled Stones.Explore more on these topicsFriendliesEnglandWalesmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

There must also be laughter to accompany reflection.No sane observer could claim Steve Clarke’s team deserved to prevail here. Lewis Ferguson and Lyndon Dykes sealed the win. Dick Turpin sprang to mind. Someone, somewhere appears to be smiling on Scotland’s bid to play in a World Cup for the first time since 1998. The Scots, who had just 31% possession, are now in an excellent position in Group C. A playoff spot could be secured on Sunday evening, when Belarus visit Glasgow.Greece, who next travel to Denmark, need snookers.England v Wales: international football friendly – liveRead more“Football is a 90-minute game and you have to make sure you come out of it with a positive result,” said Clarke. “Maybe 3-1 flatters us but we did enough to win the game. It is a big win for us. Results are the only thing that qualify you for a tournament.”Assessment of this Scotland team is not particularly easy. This game actually summed that up. Euphoria swept the country as Clarke led his men to the last European Championship. Epic disappointment was not only the theme in Germany but again as the Scots returned for Nations League action. Scotland rallied impressively in that group before comprehensive defeat by Greece in a playoff. Four points out of a possible six when Scotland began their World Cup campaign represented fine return and enhanced the mood around the national side once again.Greece’s performance in swaggering to a 3-0 win in Glasgowin March meant Scotland should have been forewarned and forearmed.Greece handed Scotland a boost by leaving Konstantinos Karetsas on the bench, with the outstanding attacker recovering from illness. The visitors should, though, have been ahead inside eight minutes. Tasos Bakasetas played a delightful ball across the face of goal, with Vangelis Pavlidis inexplicably failing to tap home.Greece tormented their hosts in wide areas during the opening exchanges. Although that brought no tangible reward, the atmosphere was noticeably flat for that first half hour. Scotland offered no threat whatsoever, a scenario due largely to the intensity of the Greek press. “We had to dig in,” said Clarke.View image in fullscreenRyan Christie jumps for joy after equalising for Scotland barely two minutes after Greece had taken a deserved second-half lead.Photograph: Ian MacNicol/Getty ImagesThe manager resisted what must have been a strong temptation to implement change during the break. Ben Gannon-Doak, brought into the team to supply ammunition from the left side, had been peripheral. Scotland’s first-half XG was 0.06. In fairness to the manager, his bench was not rich in game-altering talent.Within 90 seconds of the restart, Pavlidis had another opportunity; this time he headed over from eight yards. Hampden moaned and groaned. The frustration turned to audible anger as Giorgos Masouras shanked Greece’s next chance over the crossbar. Scotland, a team seeking to create history, still had not had a meaningful attempt at goal.Scotland’s first change was an enforced one. Aaron Hickey, who has endured a horrible time with injury, pulled up. The Brentford full-back could last no longer than the 58th minute. As Anthony Ralston replaced Hickey, Clarke also took the opportunity to introduce Billy Gilmour for Gannon-Doak. The switch was not met positively in the stands, with Gannon-Doak not amused either. Gilmour’s arrival with a view to earning at least a modicum of midfield control was perfectly sensible.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Neat interplay between Christos Tzolis and Bakasetas preceded a Pavlidis shot that was blocked by John Souttar. Kostas Tsimikas pounced on the rebound to find the back of Angus Gunn’s net. Now, Scotland were under serious pressure.Their response was barely in keeping with anything that came before. Greece failed to deal with a corner, with Grant Hanley’s header back into the penalty area only half cleared by Ntinos Mavropanos. This time it was Ryan Christie who collected a loose ball to restore parity. Scotland survived a lengthy check by the video assistant referee for offside.Che Adams latched on to Gilmour free-kick but fluffed his lines. With 15 minutes to play, this was an end-to-end contest. Ferguson fired high into the net after Greece made a mess of dealing with an inswinging Andy Robertson free-kick. This was Ferguson’s first international goal. Equally significant was Gunn producing an outstanding save to deny Karetsas. Dykes added gloss after an all-time howler from Kostas Tzolakis in the Greece goal. Scottish celebration contrasted with understandably bemused Greek faces.

Instead, United’s largest minority owner reached for the easy punchbag of the media to opt out of facing the hard truth of the team under Amorim.Discussing the 40-year-old’s position, Ratcliffe said: “You can’t run a club likeManchester Unitedon kneejerk reactions to some journalist who goes off on one every week.”Fair enough, except Ratcliffe would struggle to name any football scribe who leads United’s training sessions, selects the XI and sticks to a rigid 3-4-3 that has drawn a desultory 20 wins and 21 losses from 50 games, as Amorim has.Or who turned up for the opening fixture of the season against a serious title contender (Arsenal) in a pickle over who should be his No 1 goalkeeper despite signalling discontent last April with the incumbent (André Onana). Result: Altay Bayindir, in for the Cameroonian, was culpable forthe Gunners’ winner at Old Trafford.And, also, failed to recruit an elite No 6, leaving Casemiro’s ageing legs and Manuel Ugarte’s untrusted ones to service the United engine room until the winter window, at least.View image in fullscreenManuel Ugarte has not convinced in central midfield for Manchester United.Photograph: Vince Mignott/MB Media/Getty ImagesAmorim is being scrutinised by the media, pundits, United fans and other enthusiasts because of his track record at United. What will influence Ratcliffe is the financial bottom line – the lingua franca of the Ineos billionaire and the six Glazer siblings who collectively are United’s majority owners.So far, so bad.Defeat in May’s Europa League finalby Tottenham meant no Champions League football this season and the loss of about £100m from competing in the blue-riband tournament. The all-time Premier League low finish of 15th yielded £136.2m from the cash-soaked competition, but that was a near £50m – or the best part of a Matheus Cunha – less than Liverpool’s £174.9m cash prize for taking the title.If this trend of failure to claim a trophy and plunging league form continues the plug will surely be pulled on Amorim by Ratcliffe, the head of football policy, far sooner than three years.After a summer net spend of about £170m (signing Cunha, Benjamin Sesko, Senne Lammens and Diego Léon) United were supposed to hit the ground running. Instead, three losses (to Arsenal, Manchester City and Brentford), three wins (against Burnley, Chelsea and Sunderland) and a draw at Fulham can be characterised as a faltering start, at best, and the 12-11 Carabao Cup penalty shootoutloss to fourth-tier Grimsbywas a farrago, the poorest/most unprofessional United display witnessed by these eyes in 13 years as the club correspondent.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The answer, politely, is: how can there be until two consecutive league matches, at least, are won under him for the first time? Afterbeating Sunderland 2-0before the international break, United go to Anfield. Do not bet the farm on him finally breaking that barrier against the champions.Consider Amorim’s run in the league. In 34 top-flight outings, 37 points have been accrued. Amorim has won 10 matches.In the same interview with The Business podcast, Ratcliffe said: “Football is not overnight. You look at [Mikel] Arteta at Arsenal. He had a miserable time over the first couple of years.”The Spaniard did, but he had the FA Cup triumph of 2020 (his opening season) as ballast and he did not finish 15th then. Instead, the Gunners placed eighth and have since been eighth, fifth, second, second and second.Ratcliffe is said to find piloting United “stressful”, an insight into how, while everyone expects him to have answers to every question, he is human too. Maybe the job’s stresses explain why he offered three years as a mark of when Amorim can be judged.No one knows where Amorim will take the United train. But another annus horribilis – or even a poor next few weeks – and the head coach can surely not survive.Explore more on these topicsManchester UnitedRuben AmorimJim RatcliffecommentShareReuse this content"

Baxter, however, believes rugby should be primarily focused on improving its existing competitions.Senior rugby figures believe rebel R360 league all but dead after unions’ statementRead more“We don’t want the best players in the competition not playing for us or the teams playing against us,” said Baxter, who takes his unbeaten Chiefs side to Bristol on Saturday. “I want us to be attractive to players like Len Ikitau and [fellow Wallaby signing] Tom Hooper and for them to think they’re playing in a frontline competition.“For me we’ve got a very good competition here. Our responsibility is to improve the product we’ve got. Another competition doesn’t create more interest, creating a better game does. Throwing in other competitions might feel like a great fix [but] I don’t know that it is because the game still has to be attractive for people to come and watch.”Ikitau, 27, who has signed for Exeter for this season, has made clear he wants to represent the Wallabies at the 2027 Rugby World Cup but Baxter accepts a lucrative R360 deal might be attractive to some older players. “Is it an opportunity for a group of players post their international careers? Potentially. But I don’t know if that’s what’s going to make it an attractive competition.“I know we’re hearing all sorts of things about why it might be good for players because of fewer games and player welfare.

We’re starting to actually realise that red cards for non-deliberate actions are no way to run a sport. We’re now talking about promoting the physicality and the competitiveness of the Premiership because we’ve realised that’s what people actually want to watch.“Yes, people love tries but games need to have an element of everything. The contest, the physicality, the skill and the speed … you can’t try and create a game based on one thing. Without some physicality, wear and tear and some endurance battles you don’t create space for anybody so you don’t get either game. I think we’re starting to address it now.

Fifa has set up a working group to examine the issue, and the global governing body has given itself a headache by awarding the 2034World Cupto Saudi Arabia. That tournament will almost certainly be staged in winter, as Qatar 2022 was. Infantino suggested the sport should get used to untying itself from the European summer.Club World Cup has left an injury trail that is damaging football. But will anyone listen? | Jacob SteinbergRead more“We are already into the nitty-gritty, we are discussing all the time,” he said. “It’s not just about one World Cup, it’s a general reflection. Even to play in some European countries in July it is very, very hot. The best month to play football, which is June, is not used very much in Europe.“Maybe there are ways we can optimise the calendar, but we are discussing it and we will see when we come to some conclusions. We just have to keep an open mind.”Infantino was speaking on the sidelines of the European Football Clubs – formerly European Club Association – general assembly in Rome. He had expressed similar sentiments to the event’s 900 delegates, saying: “We should look into the globalisation of the international match calendar.” He cited October and March as “the months you can play everywhere”.Such a drastic reconfiguration would cause ructions, although Fifa’s ability to implement its wishes may be compromised if a formal complaint against its imposition of the calendar, filed to the European Commission last year by European Leagues, Fifpro and La Liga, leads to proceedings being opened.View image in fullscreenEuropean Football Clubs President Nasser Al-Khelaifi (right) with Gianni Infantino at the EFC General Assembly.Photograph: Fabrizio Corradetti/APFifa is also looking at ways to expand the Club World Cup.A 48-team structure is possible for its next edition, in 2029,with the potential for a qualifying playoff event that whittles the final number down to 32. Infantino alluded to ambitious plans in his Rome speech, saying Fifa would “work to see how we can make this event bigger, even better, even more impactful”.Spain and Morocco are favourites to host the 2029 event, which will take place in the summer, although other contenders have been weighed up. A swift return to the US could be entertained and it is understood China, which had been due to host the tournament in 2021 until Covid-19 hit, remains interested.Fifa is considering holding theClub World Cupevery two years after 2029. Qatar is the strong frontrunner to host any 2031 edition, a move that would be made more straightforward if Infantino’s favoured rejig is achieved given a winter scheduling would be inevitable.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

On Monday,Uefa said it had given La Liga and Serie A permissionto play a match in the US and Australia respectively, emphasising this was granted on an exceptional basis. Fifa’s final say is a formality, but Infantino appeared to suggest the prospect did not sit easily.“We have a structure whereby we have games at national level, continental level and global level,” he said. “This is the structure that made football the No 1 sport in the world. If we want to break this structure, we take a big risk. If we want to regulate it, then we have to look into it. We have to speak to all the stakeholders.“I think we need a reflection that is more global on what we want to do. Do we want everyone to play everywhere and do whatever he wants? Fine, Fifa is pretty strong in this respect. Or do we want to have a regulated system that takes into account the interests of everyone at national level, continental level and club level, but also the legitimacy of everyone to organise events and regulate the sport in their own country?”Among other developments at the EFC general assembly was confirmation of Barcelona’s return to the fold, which had been trailed by the club president, Joan Laporta’s, presence at the official dinner on Wednesday. Barcelona withdrew from the organisation after the abortive Super League project in 2021, which they had driven alongside Real Madrid and Juventus.The EFC president, Nasser al-Khelaifi, joked that their rekindled relationship had been formalised during a “romantic walk”. Their readmission appears to pour further cold water on any revival of the Super League scheme.Explore more on these topicsFifaWorld CupClub World CupGianni InfantinoFootball politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Flirtations with administration, relegation from Super League in the most dramatic circumstances in 2016 courtesy ofan extra-time defeat by Salfordand a50-0 loss to Leedsin the 2015 Challenge Cup final that Hudgell ranks as his lowest ebb.‘I stood on the shoulders of giants’: Josh Walters on scoring in the 2015 Super League Grand FinalRead moreHudgell considered selling the club several years ago, but reversed that decision and how it has paid off. The east Hull lad who grew up on the terraces of the old Craven Park watching the swashbuckling and pioneering Hull KR teams of the late 1970s and early 1980s is now overseeing the birth of a new great team – perhaps their greatest.It has been some rise. Having not won a trophy for 40 years before theChallenge Cup this season, Rovers have now added a second in quick time withthe League Leaders’ Shield. On Saturday, they return to the Grand Final looking to complete the treble; not bad for a team who finished bottom of Super League as recently as 2020.“If results and trophies define that theory then the answer to that has to be yes, this would be the greatest,” Hudgell says. “You see things through different eyes depending on your view; there was a greatness about those sides I watched in the 1980s but a lot of people would give the crown to this side, and I’m not sure I could disagree.”Hudgell, one of Britain’s leading solicitors, has gained fame and deserved respect nationally for helping overturn dozens of convictions for sub-postmasters in the Post Office Horizon scandal that made it all the way to national television in Mr Bates v the Post Office. But at his heart are the club in whom he has invested millions and seen little return: until now.Having languished for decades before and during Hudgell’s time as owner, Rovers are now one of the major forces in Super League under the leadership of Willie Peters. Last year’s maiden appearance in the Grand Final came when the Robins were still waiting to end their wait for a major trophy and the pressure was almost palpable from the stands as they limped toa 9-2 defeat by Wigan Warriors.View image in fullscreenHull KR will be out for revenge after watching the Wigan players gather in a celebratory huddle at the end of last season’s Grand Final.Photograph: Richard Sellers/PAThey face the same opposition at Old Trafford, but the talk around Rovers in the buildup is how they perhaps return a different and more resilient side. “The dynamics of the club have changed completely,” Hudgell says. “There isn’t a great sense of occasion; it’s business as usual. Last year there were too many people taking pictures of the stadium, stuff like that.“It’s an important game and it’s a game that can define greatness for this club. In the history of Hull rugby league – both clubs – nobody has achieved what we could achieve. But I think the pressure has been and gone already. The pressure was there when we hadn’t won a trophy for 40 years. The pressure was when we wanted to finish top ofSuper Leaguefor the first time.”But for Hudgell it is what Rovers’ success is bringing to the east Hull community that gives him most pride. “I’ve not always liked going to Craven Park; it’s only in the last two or three years I’ve come to enjoy being here and what it brings for a new, younger audience,” he says. “I have a real pride in the fact we’re connecting with the local people here again.”Quick GuideWellens leaves St HelensShowSt Helens have parted company with their head coach, Paul Wellens, after three years in charge after a disappointing fifth-placed finish in the regular season. Saints’ win over Leeds to reach the playoff semi-final was not enough to save Wellens, who played almost 500 games for his hometown team before replacing Kristian Woolf in 2023. “While I’m disappointed that my time at the club is coming to an end, I respect the decision,” said Wellens.PA MediaWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Attendances were about 2,500 when Hudgell assumed control of the club and even as recently as five years ago were hovering in the 6,000 region. Those numbers have doubled as Hull KR sell Craven Park out every week, with a waiting list for season tickets in 2026. Success is one reason why that surge has happened, but not the sole one in the eyes of their owner.“These players, the coach … they represent the club how the people want it to be represented and I include myself in that,” he says. “Our captain, Elliot Minchella, talks about community and what it means to be from east Hull. Life isn’t always easy here. Hull KR is often a release from the troubles people have and we understand that.”Having witnessed the lowest of lows, does Hudgell dare to dream about a possible World Club Challenge withthe new NRL champions, Brisbane, next year? “One game at a time,” he says. “But it’s nice for Hull KR to be talked about in the right way for once.”Explore more on these topicsHull KRRugby leagueWigan WarriorsSuper LeaguefeaturesShareReuse this content"

But in the space of just a few years it has mutated into the nastiest, most revealing feud in hockey: one that’s exposed theNHL’s double standards, cronyism and cultural divide.The NHL preached inclusion. So why has it got into bed with Donald Trump?Read morePreseason hockey is meaningless by design, a handful of perfunctory tune-ups that even hardcore fans barely notice in the run-up to opening night, when the games finally start to count. Yet in the past week the Panthers and Lightning turned a pair of exhibition contests into three-hour fever dreams of violence: 114 penalties totaling nearly 500 minutes in the box, 16 game misconducts and one ejected playerwho somehow picked up an assiston an eighth goal that shouldn’t have counted. It was all-out bedlam before the season even began, but the uneven fallout has raised uncomfortable questions around the sport.It all kicked off last Thursday when Florida’s AJ Greersucker-punched Tampa’s Brandon Hagelin the head – a callback to last spring’s playoff meeting between the teams, whenHagel’s borderline hiton Panthers captain Aleksander Barkov sparked Florida defensemanAaron Ekblad’s retaliatory headshotthat left Hagel concussed. Greer’s cheap shot, punished with only a $2,000 fine, broke hockey’s unspoken code: you never go after a player with a known concussion history, especially one you’ve already injured.So on Saturday, Tampa iced a lineup of AHL enforcers and spent the night exacting frontier justice. The league’sresponse? Heavy fines and suspensions for the Lightning, none for Florida.The ugly scenes revived an old suspicion: that the NHL’s disciplinary system protects its favorites. The Panthers’ connections only make the optics worse. The league’s director of hockey operations, Colin Campbell, is a longtime power broker whose son is a minority owner and assistant general manager of – you guessed it – the Panthers. The head of player safety, George Parros, is a former Panther himself. A decade ago Campbell’s leaked emailsshowed him berating refereesfor not giving Florida preferential treatment. Nothing changed.Across theNHL, this latest bloodbath looked like business as usual: a vivid reminder that hockey’s old-boy network pulls the strings on a two-tiered system of justice.The bad blood has been brewing for years. For most of their existence the Panthers were an afterthought, overshadowed by the more successful Lightning, who won the first of their three Stanley Cups in 2004. Then they traded for Matthew Tkachuk – a brilliant, agitating forward – and hired a coach who encouraged the chaos. Overnight, the franchise became an almost comically ratty heel team: relentlessly annoying, gleefully abrasive and somehow good enough to win anyway. They ran goalies, took liberties after whistles, and seemed to delight in their role as the villains of modern hockey.Tampa, by contrast, had built their dynasty on cool precision: a team that mixed speed, skill and structure to win back-to-back Cups in 2020 and 2021. To Lightning fans, Florida’s rise represented something else: the triumph of cynicism, of hockey as provocation rather than craft.View image in fullscreenBrandon Hagel of the Tampa Bay Lightning, in blue, collides with Aleksander Barkov of the Florida Panthers during Game 1 of their Eastern Conference first-round playoff series in April.Photograph: Mike Carlson/Getty ImagesThe long-simmering tensions finally exploded in April’s postseason meeting. When Hagel flattened Barkov with what looked like a clean shoulder check – a hockey play at playoff speed gone wrong – the officials ruled it illegal because Barkov hadn’t touched the puck. Hagel was slapped with a one-game suspension. The next night Ekblad, who’d already served a lengthy ban earlier in the season for performance-enhancing drugs, hunted him down and delivered a full-force shot to the head, concussing him – a retaliatory hit that earned just two games. Florida went on to win the series and their second straight Cup, while Tampa were left muttering about double standards.So when Greer targeted Hagel again – during a meaningless September preseason game, no less – the Lightning saw red. Coach Jon Cooper rested his stars and called up six players from the minors – two known enforcers among them – to ice a full lineup without exposing his smaller, skilled forwards. Within minutes, 32-year-old bruiser Scott Sabourinleveled Ekblad with a single punchthat dropped him to his knees. From there the night descended into absurdity: brawls after nearly every whistle, fights in the penalty box, more than 300 combined penalty minutes and so many ejections that both teams ended with nine skaters. At one point, Florida’s Niko Mikkola even picked up an assist despite having been sent off minutes earlier. It’s not every night an ejected player somehow helps to extend an 8-0 lead before anyone notices.The next day, the discipline meted out by the NHL’s department of player safety came down squarely on Tampa. Six players fined, two suspended, the organization docked $100,000 and Cooper fined another $25,000. Florida’s Greer kept his token $2,000 fine. The perception was plain as day: the Panthers could do no wrong. And that sense of impunity is what has turned a once-anodyne cross-state rivalry into something much darker: a microcosm of how the NHL still protects its insiders and punishes its critics.That defiance fits neatly with the Panthers’ broader identity. Under owner Vincent Viola – a billionaire financier andone-time Donald Trump nomineefor secretary of the army – the franchise has cultivated an overtly Maga aesthetic. After their first Cup win, team executives proudly visited Trump at the White House, presenting him with a custom “45–47” jersey. Viola’s longtime business partner and minority owner Douglas Cifu, the Panthers’ vice-chairman and alternate governor, also runs Virtu Financial, the high-frequency trading firm he co-founded with Viola. In May, Cifu was suspended indefinitely by the NHL afteran inflammatory social-media exchangewith a Canadian fan where he invoked the Israel-Palestine conflict and Trump’s 51st state taunts, a move that did little to distance the team from its hard-right image.View image in fullscreenUnder billionaire owner Vincent Viola, center, the Florida Panthers have cultivated an unmistakably Maga aesthetic.Photograph: Kevin Dietsch/Getty ImagesAcross the state, the Lightning’s ownership has taken the opposite tack: removing a Robert E Lee statue from downtown Tampa, supporting diversity initiatives and hosting some of the league’s most inclusive heritage nights.In miniature, the Battle of Florida now mirrors the United States itself: grievance and aggression on one side, progressive branding on the other, both locked in a fight over what the sport, and the country, should be.The irony is that all this has unfolded during what’s meant to be the NHL’s modern age of enlightenment. League executives boast about player safety and mental-health awareness, and evolving beyond the blood-and-guts spectacle of decades past. Yet its disciplinary machinery still operates with the opaque impunity of an old boys’ club. When New York Rangers owner James Dolansemi-publicly condemnedthe league’s refusal to suspend Washington’s Tom Wilson in 2021, the NHL didn’t revisit the call; itfined the team $250,000for daring to question it. Commissioner Gary Bettman scolded the Rangers for “demeaning” a league executive and declared such criticism “unacceptable”. The message was clear enough: silence is rewarded, dissent is punished and the culture that enables violence is the one most fiercely protected.This time, though, the silence has cracked. Around the league, executives and players are said to be quietly rooting for Tampa – not because they condone vigilante justice, but because they recognize the futility of appealing to a system stacked against them. The Panthers may have won the Stanley Cup for two years running, but they’ve also become the embodiment of a league that rewards swagger and punishes accountability.That the NHL’s biggest controversy of the year erupted before a single regular-season game had been played says it all. The sport that keeps promising to modernize still can’t stop celebrating its own anarchy: a league where power, not principle, decides who gets away with what – and who gets left bleeding on the ice.Explore more on these topicsNHLFlorida PanthersTampa Bay LightningUS sportsIce hockeyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

That’s whatI missed, the adrenaline and addiction to competing. I spent years trying to find that feeling again.“I ran a couple of marathons and I did all sorts of things trying to hunt that feeling down, but I had to get it into my mind that I’m never going to have that feeling again in the same way.

She was a critical component in Arsenal’s 2006-07 quadruple-winning team, having joined from Charlton in 2006, and won 13 major trophies with the Gunners during two spells before signing for Chelsea.She is lacing up her boots again, for the second time in six and a half months, to take part inChelsea’s legends match against Liverpoolat Stamford Bridge on Saturday, having become the first woman to play for the Blues in the reverse fixture at Anfield. All proceeds from the game will go to the Chelsea FC Foundation and Chelsea Players’ Trust – two wings of the club Chapman is keen to support having found her step away from playing tough.View image in fullscreenKatie Chapman is thrown into the air by her Chelsea teammates after her final game in 2018.Photograph: Nigel French/PALaura Cordingley, the CEO of the Chelsea Foundation, helps drive the work to support current and former players. “We have a huge duty of care towards those that have come before, not least because it’s really important to the club, but also from a foundation perspective, because our players and past players are so inspirational to the next generation of young people coming through,” she says. “Players can help us support the right narratives with young people too, with those who may or may not make it as professional football players.”The support is wide-ranging and for any player who has stepped through the doors in Cobham, be it for 10 years or one day. “It doesn’t matter when they may need support or what it looks like, we will be there for them,” Cordingley says.“What we really want to make sure is that we’re not overlapping. We work closely with the player care team in the academy and we make sure we’re greater than the sum of our parts. One of the first things we do is go to the PFA [Professional Footballers’ Association] and ask what support they have available. Then we look at how we can be additive to that. It’s about how we bring all the right people together to create the right package of support.”The WSL title race bursts into life – Women’s Football WeeklyRead moreChapman, who does many things including working as a pre- and postnatal personal trainer and co-hosting a grassroots football podcast, became a women’s ambassador for Chelsea after retiring, which was a lifeline, but she struggled. “It’s really tough,” she says. “I had a mortgage to pay and I had kids to look after and I did need to jump from one job to another. I didn’t have the time to breathe. I was lucky that Chelsea took me on as an ambassador that helped me with that gap between things.“I had a lot of anxiety for many years. When you’re an athlete you don’t show weakness – struggling is a weakness – and it’s hard sometimes for you to put yourself out there and ask for help and ask what help’s available. It took me quite a long time to come to terms with that and think: ‘I do need help, I do need support and it’s not a weakness.’“I had counselling through the Professional Footballers’ Association when I hadcome to terms with the fact that I was really struggling. Back then there was support available, but did we really know it was there and have access to it? Not really. Did we understand what was available? Not really. I think that’s got better over the years.”Losing the structure and routine of professional football is “a big part of it”, she says. “You know what you’re doing on a daily basis, what you’re doing with your body, what training looks like, what meetings look like. Everything’s managed for you. There’s also an identity piece as well. You come out and you’re like: ‘Who am I?’”View image in fullscreenKatie Chapman stretches to make a challenge against France at the 2015 World Cup.Photograph: Steve Bardens/Fifa/Getty ImagesChapman had another part of her life to fall back on. As a mother of three she slotted into being mum instead of professional player. “I dived into that and I’m grateful for that because I could have ended up in a different space,” the former Chelsea captain says. “Regardless of whether we think we’re ready for the next stage or not, the impact is massive. When I talk to a lot of people, not just in football, but around any sport, it’s the same.”The risk is that athletes stepping back from their sports, searching for new purpose and obsession, can find it in dark places. “It can become really dangerous,” says Chapman. “I came out of football and I was like: ‘Oh my God, I understand why people go off the rails and they go in all kinds of different directions and potentially find an addiction somewhere else.’ It is because you’re searching for that adrenaline piece, that feeling you got from competing, and we can all go different ways with that.”That is why she cares about the work being done to support players and is taking part in the legends match. That, and she would struggle to pass up an opportunity to play. “I love it. It makes me feel alive again and puts a smile on my face. It also gives me a rewarding feeling.

The visit marks the passing of the countries’ free trade agreement.No 10 has announced a slew of investments, from fintech to university campuses, as well as the making of three Bollywood films in the UK. On Thursday, Starmer signed a defence deal worth £350m for UK missiles, manufactured in Northern Ireland, to be used by the Indian army.“Our history together is deep, the human connections between our people are truly special,” Starmer said as he left Mumbai. “Building on our historic trade deal, we are remaking this partnership for our times.”Starmer has spent time in Mumbai studying the Indian digital ID system, including meeting key figures who designed the widespread system used by more than 1 billion people for benefits, payments and identification.The prime minister hinted that the UK was interested in broadening the scope of digital ID beyond making it mandatory to prove rights to work. He suggested the UK would eventually look at linking it to banking and payments systems – on a voluntary basis – as well as for administrative tasks such as mortgage and school applications.“It’s been taken up on a voluntary basis [in India] in huge numbers, not least because it means that you can access your own money, make payments so much more easily than is available with others,” he said.“The speed with which it allows citizens here to access services, particularly financial services, is something that was recognised in our discussions yesterday, and actually aFintechdiscussion that we had today as well. So we’re looking at those examples of how digital ID helps individuals with the processes that sometimes take too long and are too cumbersome and makes them easier for them.”Starmer acknowledged the government had to make the case for the reforms to the British public, which have plummeted in popularity since Starmer announced them.“I think now we need to go out and make that case of the huge benefits … And I think that the more people see the benefits that come with this … as has happened in other countries, people say: ‘That will make my life easier,’ and therefore I want to get on with it,” he said.Starmer has been welcomed to India with thousands of posters of himself plastered across the main streets and motorways of Mumbai. When he appeared on stage at a conference, Narendra Modi, the Indian prime minister, addressed him as his friend and praised him for having unblocked the trade deal.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Starmer confirmed that he and Modi discussed how India was continuing to buy Russian oil, which is subject to widespread western sanctions.“For prime minister Modi and myself the focus on ending this conflict and the various steps will be taken to that end,” he said. “And that was a wide range of discussion, but we did set out the steps that we are taking in relation to energy.”Starmer also said he had raised the case of the British Sikh activist Jagtar Singh Johal, from Dumbarton, who has been held in an Indian jail for nearly eight years without facing full trial. It is often cited as one of the worst examples of injustice among Britons still held abroad.But Starmer did not suggest much progress had been made. “Yes, we did raise the consular cases,” he said. “We always raise them when we have the opportunity to do so. I should say that the foreign secretary is meeting the families in coming weeks, as well as raising it today.”The prime minister is widely expected to take a similar trade-focused trip to China in the coming year as part of a mission to ease relations between the UK and China.That relationship is under the spotlight because of the collapse of a Chinese spying case, said to have happened because the UK has been unwilling to provide fresh evidence that China is considered a threat.Starmer said the UK was keen to pursue other trading relationships but said a trade deal with China was not on the agenda. “That’s not on our list, for a trade deal as such, but our position is to cooperate where we can, challenge where we must, and that’s been the consistent policy of the government in relation to China.”Explore more on these topicsKeir StarmerDonald TrumpIndiaFintechTrade policyGazaIsraelnewsShareReuse this content"

Thank you to the security services,” the defence minister, Theo Francken, said on social media.According to reports, police searched a residence just a few hundred metres from De Wever’s home in the city.“During a search of one suspect’s home, an improvised device – potentially explosive but not yet operational – was found, along with a bag containing metal pellets,” Fransen said.At the home of a second suspect, police discovered a 3D printer “believed to have been intended for manufacturing components useful in carrying out an attack”, she added.The suspects were born in 2001, 2002 and 2007.Two of them were being questioned by federal police and were due to appear before an investigating judge on Friday.The third suspect was released.Explore more on these topicsBelgiumEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

They add to hisrolesas a senior adviser to Goldman Sachs International, the investment bank, and speechmaker to investment firms including Bain Capital and Makena Capital in the US, which have netted him over £150,000 a talk.Sunak was prime minister from October 2022 to July 2024, and he joins the $3.9tn technology company Microsoft afterapplaudingit when he was in office as “one of the founding fathers of modern technology”.He follows Nick Clegg, the former Liberal Democrat deputy prime minister, in becoming a paid adviser to one of the Silicon Valley giants. Clegg was president of global affairs for Meta, which operates Instagram and Facebook. Sunak’s senior political adviser, Liam Booth-Smith, also took a role with Anthropic, itemergedin June.The former Conservative leaderunveileda £2.5bn deal with Microsoft’s chief executive, Brad Smith, at the Bletchley Park AI summit in November 2023, in which Microsoft announced what Sunak called a “historic” investment in new datacentres. He also held one-to-one meetings with Bill Gates, the co-founder of Microsoft, which committed another £22bn in UK investment last month and with figures from OpenAI, the startup behind ChatGPT, in which Microsoft is a major investor.Microsoft also has several large contracts with government departments, including the newest memorandum of understanding “representing a yearly spend of £1.4bn to deliver digital transformation, adoption of AI and cloud services”,saidAcoba, which approved the appointment on condition of guardrails to prevent conflicts of interest.In 2023, while Sunak was in 10 Downing Street, the government’s competition watchdog angeredMicrosoftwhen it blocked its attempts to buy the Call of Duty maker Activision. The deal went through after it was restructured.The Westminster authorities cited concerns that “there are risks associated with your access to information that may grant Microsoft an unfair advantage”. Sunak said that he will provide “high-level strategic perspectives on macro-economic and geopolitical trends” and will not advise on UK policy matters.He will divert his salary from both jobs into the Richmond Project, a charity which sets out to boost social mobility through numeracy that he founded with his wife, Akshata Murty, earlier this year.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Anthropic’s chief executive, Dario Amodei, earlier this yearpredictedthat AI could eliminate half of all entry-level white-collar jobs within five years.Acobasaidthat while AI was a significant priority when Sunak was PM, including enacting legislation affecting companies in the AI sector, “there is no suggestion any decisions or actions were taken in office in expectation of this role, and the Cabinet Office confirmed it is not aware of any decisions you made that were specific to Anthropic, as opposed to sector wide.”It said, “there is a reasonable concern that your appointment could be seen to offer unfair access and influence within the UK government”, which was heightened “at a time of intense debate and lobbying around the world” on the right approach to regulating the increasingly powerful technology. But Sunak told the committee the role will be internallyoriented and will not involve any lobbying.A spokesperson for Anthropic said it was pleased to welcome Sunak.“He was among the first global leaders to recognize AI’s transformative potential, establishing the world’s first AI Safety Institute and convening the inaugural AI Safety Summit at Bletchley Park,” they said. “His experience will provide valuable strategic perspective as we work to ensure AI benefits humanity. This internally-focused, part-time advisory role fully complies with the conditions of Acoba, and Mr Sunak is donating his entire compensation to the Richmond Project charity.”Sunak said he was “excited to help these two companies, as they address the big strategic questions about how to make tech work for our economies, our security and our society”.“We stand on the edge of a technological revolution whose impacts will be as profound as those of the industrial revolution: and felt more quickly,” he said. “In my role as a senior adviser, I want to help these companies ensure that this shift delivers the improvements in all of our lives that it can.”Microsoft was approached for comment.Explore more on these topicsRishi SunakMicrosoftComputingArtificial intelligence (AI)newsShareReuse this content"

We’re pleased with the court’s dismissal and look forward to continuing our work successfully promoting Drake’s music and investing in his career.”A spokesperson forDrakesaid in a statement: “We intend to appeal today’s ruling, and we look forward to the court of appeals reviewing it.”Drake, who is signed to Republic Records, and Lamar, signed to Interscope Records, both operate under the Universal Music Group umbrella but through separate labels. The legal fight began earlier this year when Drake accused UMG of damaging his reputation by distributing and promoting Not Like Us.He claimed the company made secret payments and offered discounted licensing deals to boost the song’s reach, allegedly to harm his brand and reduce his leverage in ongoing contract talks.In March,UMG filedto have the motion dismissed. The label claimed that Drake “lost a rap battle that he provoked and in which he willingly participated”.“Instead of accepting the loss like the unbothered rap artist he often claims to be, he has sued his own record label in a misguided attempt to salve his wounds,” UMG said in its statement. “Plaintiff’s complaint is utterly without merit and should be dismissed with prejudice.”Kendrick Lamar is widely acknowledged to have won last year’s culture-consuming rap beef with Drake, with Not Like Us going on to win five Grammy awards, including record of the year and song of the year.Explore more on these topicsDrakeUniversal MusicKendrick LamarRapHip-hopnewsShareReuse this content"

Now the writer will be hoping to repeat the success for another child actor, turning his attention to a BBC adaptation of William Golding’s novel.The four-part series will follow a group of young schoolchildren who find themselves stranded on a tropical island without adult supervision after a deadly plane crash, and is expected to air next year.View image in fullscreenDavid McKenna, who stars as Piggy in the forthcoming TV adaptation of Lord of the FliesPhotograph: J Redza/Eleven/BBCEach of the episodes is titled after a character at the core of the story – Ralph, Piggy, Simon and Jack.

The castaways are played by Winston Sawyers as Ralph, Lox Pratt as Jack, David McKenna as Piggy and Ike Talbut as Simon. They will appear alongside an ensemble of more than 30 boys playing the desert island camp’s “biguns” and “littluns”.In the midst of disaster and in an attempt to remain civil, the boys organise themselves, led by Ralph and supported by the group’s intellectual, Piggy. But Jack, who is in charge of signal fire duty, is more interested in hunting and vying for leadership and soon begins to draw other boys away from the order of the group and, ultimately, from hope to tragedy.Thorne’s adaptation is billed by the BBC as truthful to the original novel – set in the early 1950s on an unnamed Pacific island – and will delve further into the book’s emotive themes of human nature, the loss of innocence and boyhood masculinity.View image in fullscreenIke Talbut (Simon) and Lox Pratt (Jack) on location in Malyasia for the forthcoming TV adaptation of Lord of the FliesPhotograph: J Redza/Eleven/BBCThe boys were cast after an open call led by casting director Nina Gold, whose credits include Game of Thrones and Baby Reindeer.Pratt has also been chosen to play Draco Malfoy in Amazon’s forthcoming TV series remake of JK Rowling’s Harry Potter novels, while Winston Sawyers is the son of Parker Sawyers, an American actor who has appeared in TV shows including Lilyhammer, Succession and A Discovery of Witches.Lord of the Flies, first published by Faber, has become one of the most popular books on the English curriculum for the last 70 years.

Solitaire Townsend, the co-founder of the Futerra consultancy, said it would lift what is likely to be a difficult summit, at which the world must agree fresh targets on reducing greenhouse gas emissions.“Is Prince William attending Cop a stunt? Yes. But that doesn’t mean it’s a bad idea,” she said. “Cop has long been as much about so-called ‘optics’ as it is negotiations. Prince William’s announcement will likely encourage other leaders to commit, and will have the global media sitting up to attention.“I suspect HRH knows very well that by showing up, he’ll drag millions of eyes to the event.

He was heavily criticised by leading environmental voices, including the former UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon and the former Irish president Mary Robinson, for appearing to waver on the decision late last month.Ban said: “World leaders must be in Belém forCop30.

The total plastic waste exports in the first half of the year came to 317,747 tonnes.View image in fullscreenUsed packaging being sorted at a recycling centre in London. Across the country 21 such factories have closed in the past two years.Photograph: Peter Dazeley/Getty ImagesExporting hundreds of thousands of tonnes of plastic waste to countries without the capability to process it properlyincreases the chance of serious environmental pollutionas well as putting the lives of waste workers at risk.James Mcleary, the managing director of Biffa polymers, said the industry was facing challenges and units were closing across the country.Plastic recycling facilities that have closed in the past two years include Biffa’s Sunderland factory, which had capacity to process 39,000 tonnes each year of high-density polyethylene (HDPE) and polypropylene (PP) plastic – used in packaging – and three Viridor facilities. Vanden Recyclingis also closing its plastics processing sitein Whittlesey, Peterborough.Keeping the waste material collected from households within the UK to be cleaned, sorted, processed and turned into recycled products, is better environmentally, captures the carbon within the plastic, and creates jobs and growth, experts say.But policymakers have not made the key changes needed to stop incentivising plastic waste exports.I don’t want to wonder if there is a boy whose life has been wasted somewhere because of me throwing something in a binMcleary said the continued export of waste plastic should be an affront to our civilised society. He cited the deathsof 200 young people in Turkeythat were exposed earlier this year by ISIG Meclisi, which carried out the first analysis of workplace deaths in the country’s recycling industry. The UK was the largest exporter of plastic waste to Turkey in 2023.The investigation, called Boy Wasted, revealed that two people are crushed, ripped, or burned to death in the sector every month, and that this has been the case non-stop for the past 10 years.Mcleary said there was a need for a level playing field for the UK plastic recycling industry. “I don’t like closing plants, it’s jobs and it’s people lives,” he said. “Fundamentally I believe you need to take responsibility for our waste ourselves. It is just common sense as a human being. I don’t want my rubbish to end up in Malaysia. I don’t want to wonder if there is a boy whose life has been wasted somewhere because of me throwing something in a bin outside my house.“There are lines as a civilised society we should not cross – it is not acceptable.”View image in fullscreenA waste worker at a landfill site near Istanbul. The UK is the biggest exporter of plastic waste to Turkey.Photograph: Sedat Suna/EPAMcleary said the loophole that made it cheaper for companies to export plastic rather than keep it in the UK needed to be closed. “We are asking for a level playing field. We don’t want the market tilted towards us. This has been pointed out over a number of years by ourselves and others. Yet today we are in a perfect storm and factories are closing.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But he wants it to be more ambitious by raising the requirement for products to have a minimum recycled content to 50% by 2030 to encourage manufacturers incorporate more of it into their products and reduce the use of virgin plastic.Building a UK plastic recycling industry to keep the plastic waste thrown out by householders within the country had the potential to become a £2bn industry, hiring 2,000 people directly and 3,000 indirectly and would also restore public confidence in recycling, Mcleary said.“People in the UK should care where their plastic goes,” he added. “If they think they are recycling they should know it is being recycled, and know that it is being recycled in a responsible fashion.”Viridor has closed three plastic recycling factories in the past three years; in Avonmouth, Skelmersdale and this year its Rochester sorting plant.View image in fullscreenA UK recycling plant sorts plastic waste into bales, ready to be processed.Photograph: Teamjackson/Getty ImagesAn industry source said it was important that policymakers started seeing waste as critical infrastructure. “If we were to stop exporting plastic waste, and we were to meet our increased recycling target of a 65% recycling rate for municipal waste by 2035, we would need to build 40 new factories across the UK – 20 of them would be sorting facilities and 20 would be processing facilities turning the material back into products,” the source said.“This is a key growth area and has a carbon benefit because it stops the plastic being incinerated and used in energy for waste. But the risk is now that we are exporting material and the investment and the jobs to other countries.”The government said it was committed to cleaning up the nation and cracking down on plastic waste. “For too long plastic waste has littered our streets, polluted Britain’s waterways, and threatened our wildlife,” a spokesperson said. “Our packaging reforms will collectively underpin £10bn worth of investment in new sorting and processing facilities, while delivering the deposit return scheme will ensure more plastic is recycled and not chucked away as litter or left to rot in landfill.”Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

As US temperatures rise, experts say the true toll needs to be countedNina Lakhaniin Phoenix, ArizonaThu 9 Oct 2025 11.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 9 Oct 2025 15.44 EDTShareAmong the autopsy reports that made my heart skip a beat was Hannah Rose Moody.One morning last May, the 31-year-old set out on a favourite desert hike near her home in Scottsdale,Arizona. It was already 91F (33C) when she set off. On Instagram, she told her 50,000 followers: “Conquering this trail as a last hurrah before summer hits 🥵☀️… I have like 5 gallons of water with me don’t worry 😅.”By midday, the temperature had climbed above 100F (38C).Hannah Moody.Photograph: Family of Hannah MoodyWhen she did not return, friends raised the alarm. A search team found her the next day, less than 100 yards (91 metres) from the parking lot.According to the infrared thermometer used by the death investigator at the scene, Hannah’s body registered 142F (61C) after a day in the desert sun. Inside her backpack were three empty water bottles, packets of fruit snacks, sunscreen and a fully charged portable phone battery. Her phone, however, had no power.Heat exposure killed Moody a week before her 32nd birthday. She was a waitressand an aspiring social media influencer who regularly posted about her Christian faith and passion for hiking. Her death was ruled an accident by the Maricopa county medical examiner.“Had she left a couple of hours earlier, she would have probably been fine … but when you’re 31 you feel invincible,” said Hannah’s mother, Terri Moody. “The irony is that she always wanted to inspire people, and in her death she finally went viral and has probably made a difference.”Hannah Moody’s case was not unusual. Her story is one of hundreds, each hidden in the dry language of medical examiner reports.This year alone, she is among more than 530 suspected heat-related deaths in Maricopa county, home to Phoenix, America’s fifth-largest city. This year’s death toll comes on top of another 3,100 confirmed heat-related fatalities over the previous decade.Wanting to understand who those deaths represent, I spent the summer reading those hundreds of autopsy reports and speaking with the families left behind.The autopsy and investigative reports, which I obtained from the medical examiner’s office using the Freedom of Information Act (Foia), provide a window into each person’s life and death. They note where the person was and what they were doing when they died, list medical conditions, alcohol or drug use, housing status, and whether they had air conditioning or electricity if they died indoors. About three-quarters died outdoors.I already knew from years of reporting in Arizona that some groups are especially vulnerable, including unsheltered people and those struggling with addictions. But combing through these cases revealed other, more common risk factors – such as being overweight and living with dementia. Heat overworks your heart, confuses the brain, shuts down your organs, but rarely causes death directly. It is far more common for heat to exacerbate pre-existing conditions such as diabetes, asthma and heart disease.View image in fullscreenA family sits in the shade while waiting for a ride during a heatwave in Phoenix, Arizona, in July 2023.Photograph: Brandon Bell/Getty ImagesAll the reports were clinical, yet hard to read emotionally, because what they reveal is devastating. They show lives cut short in ordinary, preventable ways – the air conditioning unit that broke, the immigrant who collapsed after the border crossing, the single mother who never woke up in her car.Take Brett George Westbrook. Last summer, the 65-year-old’s body was found decomposed in his trailer after friends noticed he had missed his daily walk for four days and called police for a welfare check. Westbrook had high blood pressure and chronic alcoholism, and had been taking cold showers to cool down since his AC broke six months earlier. According to the autopsy report, a few days before the heat killed him, he had told relatives that he had failed to fix the AC himself, and it was too expensive to get repaired.Amber Marie Goodwin-Arnold was found dead in her car, where she had been living for several weeks with her two children after moving from Illinois. Her children woke up and found their mother, who was 33, unresponsive in the driver’s seat. They went to get help, but it was too late.Maria Del Carmen Diaz Rojas, a 24-year-old undocumented immigrant who had just made it over the border, was found three days after she fell sick and was abandoned in Phoenix by smugglers. “She was found decomposed at a construction site, lying on her back fully clothed … her body temperature was 144 degrees Fahrenheit. There was no food or water in her belongings and her body was fully exposed to the sun,” the report says.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Maricopa county office of the medical examinerFrom Maria Del Carmen Diaz Rojas’s Autopsy ReportCAUSE OF DEATH:Probable environmental heat exposureMANNER OF DEATH:AccidentHOW INJURY OCCURRED:Smuggled individual found in high environmental temperatures without water or shadeAnd earlier this year, Michael Nez, an Indigenous man from the Navajo nation with a history of alcohol addiction, was found slumped and unresponsive at a bus stop. “Witnesses report he was in the same position for many hours. High temperature on the day of discovery was 104 degrees Fahrenheit,” the medical examiner’s final report says.What it did not say – but the investigator’s case notes did – was that a local fire crew, who also serve as paramedics, were among those to witness Nez “as they passed by a few times to slowly slump lower and lower on the bench throughout the day”. When they finally called in a welfare check he was already dead. When the investigator arrived an hour later, Nez’s body was lying in full sun and measured 138F.I could not reach his relatives, but anobituarydescribed Nez as a punk rock musician who found solace in long walks and the natural world, and who “will be deeply missed by all who knew him”.After weeks of combing through case files, certain deaths stayed with me.I have covered violent, traumatic deaths for nearly 20 years, but heat fatalities felt different – not sensational, just painfully ordinary and entirely preventable. That ordinariness made them seem cruel.These were people with the same medical conditions and financial struggles millions of Americans live with. None of them had to die that day.That preventability is what makes the bigger picture so shocking: heat is the leading weather-related cause of illness and death in the US – a toll made worse each year by human-driven global heating.No one dies from a heatwave ... The way in which our society is structured makes some people vulnerable and others saferBharat VenkatWhen I visited Phoenix, the city was in the grip of a grueling heatwave: temperatures hit at least 110F on 13 out of 14 straight days. Last summer, the city endured a record-breaking 113 consecutive days at or above 100F, shattering the previous record. The damaging effects of heat on the mind and body are cumulative, and we only begin to recover once the temperature drops below 80F. Last year, the temperature did not fall below 90F on 36 separate nights. (Before 2020, Phoenix had never logged more than 15 such nights in a year, according to the National Weather Service.)Even these extremes do not capture the full toll. The official heat death count for the US almost certainly underestimates the true toll, thanks to inconsistent reporting standards, limited resources for investigations, and the fact that heat usually kills indirectly by worsening existing conditions that are often listed as the main cause of death. Without understanding the circumstances of a death, the role of heat is likely to be overlooked and therefore not counted in the death toll.“No one dies from a heatwave,” Bharat Venkat, director of University of California, Los Angeles’s heat lab, told me. “The way in which our society is structured makes some people vulnerable and others safer.”In other words, it is not just the heat. It is inequality – who has access to shelter, healthcare, money and social support – that often determines who lives and who dies.View image in fullscreenA person rides a bicycle in the Zone, Phoenix’s largest homeless encampment, amid the city’s worst heatwave on record in Arizona, in July 2023.Photograph: Mario Tama/Getty ImagesOne recent large study from Chinafound that heatwaves significantly increase the risk of death caused by Alzheimer’s and other dementias. Being confused and disoriented makes it harder for people to perceive the threat and therefore more susceptible to dehydration and heatstroke. High temperatures may also exacerbate the symptoms of neurological diseases, while commonly prescribed medications can interfere with the body’s ability to regulate temperature.This does not bode well for the future.Almost 7 million older Americanscurrently live with Alzheimer’s, which is projected to more than double to 14 million by 2060.How bad the heat gets depends on whether the world takes radical action to change course and stop burning fossil fuels. But by 2050, climate scientists warn that dangerously hot days and nights will occur far morefrequently across the US, while heatwaves will last longer, affect more of the country, and become more severe.Behind every death report was a person with a life, someone with friends, hobbies, and hard times. I needed to understand who each person once was to truly understand why the heat cut their life short.To get past the clinical data, I followed the trail in the medical examiner’s case notes, which often included the first thread of a story: a neighbor who called in a welfare check, or the name of a surviving spouse.I made hundreds of calls which in many cases came to nothing – either the numbers were no longer in service or belonged to someone else. Some relatives did not want to speak with me, but others were grateful for an opportunity to talk about their loved one.Kenneth Markwood was found in his back yard, his body covered in ants, on 12 May 2025. He had wandered outside around 10am while his wife, Michelle, and stepson, Craig, were still in bed. He was smart, a retired accountant, a good dancer and keen golfer but had become increasingly withdrawn and confused over the past six months. He was 82 and had dementia, as well as chronic conditions common among older Americans: type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure and high cholesterol.Michelle, 80, told me that Kenneth had started getting distressed because he stopped recognising the house, and would ask to go home to downtown Phoenix where he had lived as a young man. Michelle would drive him there and they would sit in the car until he forgot why they had come. She never let him go out alone, but the back door was not locked because the yard was protected by a 6-ft-high fence.I can’t believe the heat killed him. I hate the way that he diedMichelleKenneth had been out in the yard for less than an hour when Craig found him. It seemed as if he had stumbled and fallen, and was unable to get up. He was still breathing but barely responsive when the paramedics arrived. His body temperature was 107F, so hot that his organs were shutting down. The normal core temperature for older people ranges between 96F to 99F, but the body’s ability to control temperature decreases with age.He was transported to a hospital where he was diagnosed with heatstroke. Kenneth never regained consciousness and was discharged to hospice care, where he died eight days later.Kenneth’s death was recorded as accidental.“My husband was extremely smart and interesting, and even after 45 years together I was still in love with him,” said Michelle. “He’d lived in Arizona since he was 15, I can’t believe the heat killed him. I hate the way that he died.”Globally, heat killed an estimated half a million people each year between 2000 and 2020, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), with deaths among older people rising by about 85% during that period. But it is also cutting short the lives of healthy young people – some who were out having fun like Hannah Moody, others who were in the middle of their working day.Michael Sheppard.Photograph: Courtesy of Deana BuelowMichael Dean Sheppard was born and raised in the Phoenix area, and had worked with his dad as a landscaper for almost 30 years. On 21 July 2024, they began work early to avoid the worst heat, arriving at a commercial business for their second and final job for the day by 9am. Michael was raking leaves at the back of the property –his dad, Harry, out front – when he felt unwell and took a 20- or 30-minute break in the van with the AC on and a Gatorade. A short while later, Harry went to check on his son as he couldn’t hear Michael’s leaf blower. He found Michael lying face down, unresponsive on the ground.He rolled his son, who was 6ft1in and 336lb, on to his back and initiated CPR. But Michael, 46, was gone. According to the autopsy report, Michael was obese and had bipolar affective disorder. Heat can exacerbate mental distress including mood disorders, and some commonly prescribed medications interfere with the body’s ability to regulate temperature.There was something about the silent leaf blower that made me teary, and I imagined how awful it must have been for Harry, 74, to find his son on the ground.It took a while to connect with Michael’s family. The number I found for the Sheppard family home was no longer in service, so on one baking hot afternoon I visited unannounced. Harry was caught off guard, and his wife, Michael’s mother, Susan, had just been admitted to a care facility. But he gave me his mobile number and said to call. I tried multiple times, to no avail. A couple of weeks later, Harry picked up. His daughter had confirmed my credentials online, and Harry was eager to tell me about his son.Michael, he said, was a “fine Christian young man who loved Jesus”, said Harry, who wept throughout the call. He loved food – especially spare ribs – and was a huge fan of Tom Brady, the football quarterback. He watched as many basketball, baseball and football games as he could, and hosted Super Bowl watch parties.View image in fullscreenMichael Sheppard.Photograph: Courtesy of Deana Buelow“He died of heat exhaustion, his heart gave out,” Harry said. “God forbid this happens to anyone else, a piece of my heart is gone for ever. Michael was more than my son. He was my right-hand man. It’s always been hot here, but not like this. I haven’t worked a single day since he died.”Harry’s grief is still so raw that he cannot bring himself to scatter Michael’s ashes.According to one recent study, heat is responsible for as many as 2,000 worker deaths each year in the US, and at least 170,000 work-related injuries. This makes heat one of the most dangerous conditions facing workers in the US, and its effects are far higher than the official counts.There is no federal standard to protect workers from deadly heat, perhaps because it is the most vulnerable – immigrants,incarcerated people, and people of color – who disproportionately make up the labor force in agriculture, construction, landscaping and manufacturing.America does not have a reliable way of counting heat deaths. The nation’s 2,000-plus coroner and medical examiner offices follow no single protocol, and in many cases, whether heat is listed as a factor depends entirely on the experience and qualifications of who certifies the death.Maricopa county, for example, is considered the gold standard for investigations that are carried out by experienced forensic pathologists, yet it has recently come under fire for allegedly undercounting heat-related deaths, specifically among the transient or homeless community.In 2024, the medical examiner’s office reported 608 confirmed heat deaths. But it also kept a separate tally of more than 800 deaths among homeless people, of which 35% were classified as heat related. But dozens of people who appeared to have died in high temperatures were not counted as heat deaths, according to alocal ABC15 investigation.I came across one such case, which I shared with Dr Christina VandePol, a retired coroner and physician from Pennsylvania, for an independent opinion.In April 2024, Tresor Banani was found dead in an alleyway close to the apartment from which he had been evicted two weeks earlier. A suitcase with some clothes, medications and hygiene products was found next to his decomposing body, alongside empty alcohol containers. He was 37 years old, and had a history of hypertension and alcohol use.The medical examiner’s final report said:Based on the above findings, reported circumstances of death, and all other investigative information received to date and as available to me, it is my opinion that the cause of death is alcohol use disorder with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease as a contributing factor. The manner of death is natural.But the preliminary investigative report, which includes case notes and details from the scene, states that “the cement in direct sunlight measured 122F on an IFR [infrared] device. The high temperature recorded over the previous 48 hours was 99F.”“I would have probably certified this as death due to excessive heat exposure with alcohol use as the contributing factor,” said VandePol. “He didn’t die while drinking in his air-conditioned apartment. It’s likely that the heat tipped him over and was the final factor … I see no reason that exposure to environmental heat should be excluded as, at the least, a possible or probable factor in his death.”A Maricopa county spokesperson said Banani showed no signs of dehydration which is often seen in heat-related deaths, and no audit of the transient death list had been conducted since media reports of alleged undercounting.I tracked down Tresor’s brother, a physician in California, who was shocked to hear from me. He said that his brother was a maths teacher who had been fired a few months earlier. He knew Tresor had been going through a hard time, but had been unaware about the eviction and alcohol use until his death. His brother wondered about the heat too, and even hired a private investigator to try to answer questions the family had about why Tresor died in such sad circumstances. He seemed relieved to have more information, but after that did not want to speak with me further.Amid increasingly brutal heatwaves, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention(CDC) created a comprehensive standardised protocolto help coroners and medical examiners ascertain the role heat played in someone’s death and improve reporting, yet no one is mandated to use it. (Maricopa county said they already collect all the data recommended, if available).We’re all gonna feel the impact of heat-related deaths and morbidity in the years to comeDr Christina VandePol“If we don’t fully account for heat deaths, we are missing opportunities to implement life-saving public health interventions. But if we faced the reality of how many Americans are dying from heat, maybe we would have to do hard things like provide access to cooling and tackle the climate crisis,” said Venkat, the heat researcher from UCLA.In many developed countries, epidemiologists estimate heat fatalities by calculating excess or unexpected deaths during a severe hot spell. For instance, the 2022 heatwave in Europe led to almost 62,000 heat-related excess deaths, while this summer 16,000 more people died prematurely. While this methodology does not provide us with details about why or how people died, it does give a much clearer picture of how many lives extreme heat is cutting short.The US, for some reason, chooses not to know.“I think it would scare people if the real numbers were available,” VandePol added. “But we’re all gonna feel the impact of heat-related deaths and morbidity in the years to come, so the sooner we stop underestimating the threat and start figuring out how to mitigate what’s going to happen, the better off we will be.”“I hate the heat,” said Terri Moody, whose daughter Hannah died hiking. “It doesn’t matter if you’re young, fit and experienced, the heat doesn’t care.”"

It was only his second time in the usually mundane shopping precinct when he gently brushed past another young couple who were walking along eating ice-cream in the afternoon sun.It was the most innocuous of encounters but it ended, within seconds, with Ahmad dying in a pool of blood. Alfie Franco, 20, had taken “petty exception” to the teenager’s minor accidental contact with his girlfriend and, high on cannabis and armed with a knife, he slashed Ahmad once in the neck.The teenager, who had dreamed of being a doctor, clutched his throat and fell to the ground. He had sustained a 6cm-deep wound and died in hospital a short time later, at about the same time he had been due to visit his new college.View image in fullscreenAlfie Franco.Photograph: West Yorkshire police/PAFranco was on Thursday found guilty of murdering Ahmad in what the prosecution described as an exhibition of “petty bravado” from a person who ran away and “is continuing to run away as he doesn’t have the courage to admit to what he’s done to that young man, which is murder him”.Franco remained stone-faced as his verdict was read out, while his mother, who attended every day of the trial with his grandfather, looked at her son and wept.In the days after the killing on 3 April, speculation swirled online that the attacker was an asylum seeker, or that it had been racially motivated, or that Ahmad was a drug dealer. None of this was true.The truth, as police quickly discovered, was that Ahmad’s murder was appallingly senseless. After turning himself in, Franco told detectives he had felt threatened by the teenager and pulled out a knife when he thought: “It’s me or him.”The 20-year-old who appeared in the courtroom dock, looking and sounding like a teenager called into the headteacher’s office for a telling off, was a far cry from the cocky figure in the video of the attack played to the court.According to people close to Franco and his family, he has had a troubled life, with issues related to drug abuse and “hanging out with the wrong crowd”. The trial at Leeds crown court heard that Franco was born in Huddersfield but moved to South Africa with his family as a baby, returning when he was 13.He said South Africa was “a beautiful place but it is quite dangerous”, telling the court his family’s home was burgled “at least once or twice a week” and that he had been mugged “countless times” but never experienced violence because he always handed his possessions over.Franco said that when he returned to Huddersfield as a teenager he was bullied because of his accent and beaten up at school. He told jurors he was stabbed in his hand when he was 17, and cut in the face during an incident last October. He carried a blade “for protection”, he told jurors, adding that all of his friends carried knives. “Most people carry a knife,” he said.Ahmad’s uncle, Ghazwan Al Ibrahim, with whom he was living in Huddersfield, said he had encouraged the teenager to go out that day, to make friends his own age, after spending Ramadan and Eid al-Fitr with his younger cousins.In a statement after the verdict on Thursday, Al Ibrahim said the boy’s parents were “heartbroken beyond words”. He would always carry a guilt, he said, that “Ahmad had come to the UK, and I could not keep him safe”. “He’d only spent a few days with my kids but they loved him so much because he was a very nice boy, very lovely and kindly with the kids,” hetold the Guardianafter Ahmad’s death.After the verdict, he said he could not imagine how his nephew must have felt spending his last moments “alone in a strange country that should have been the place where he was safe”.“The image of having to identify my nephew and then having to break the news to my brother and sister-in-law, and relay to them what had happened to their precious son, will never leave me.”Back in Homs, Ahmad had lived with his taxi driver father, his mother and his three sisters. He had been loved by his schoolmates and teachers in Syria’s third-biggest city and achieved the top maths grades in his class. He loved school, his uncle said, “that’s why he came here. He wished to be a doctor, to save people.”He had moved to Huddersfield on 20 March, 14 days before he was killed, after spending six months in a refugee centre in Swansea, where he was well liked. The staff at the centre and Ahmad’s social worker had contacted his uncle saying they were heartbroken he had died. “They were crying for Ahmad, they said they loved him,” Ghazwan Al Ibrahim said.While Franco told the jury he regularly visited South Africa to see family and friends, it has since become known that the reasons for these visits were “to keep Alfie out of trouble” and away from the increasingly violent world in West Yorkshire he had involved himself in.Franco told police after his arrest that the knife he used to kill Ahmad belonged to a recently deceased uncle and he had kept it with him for sentimental reasons. This was later found to be a lie, concocted with his brother on the way to handing himself in, in order to “get his story straight”.The defendant owned several knives, sending photos and videos of his growing collection to friends with captions such as “artillery coming along nice”. Texts read out during the trial sent the night before Ahmad’s murder showed a conversation between Franco and an acquaintance whom he told the court he was afraid of and was trying to impress.In the messages, Franco said he was “ready to do a mazza” [something crazy] and was going to “chef” and “ching” [both slang for stab] a person who had stolen the acquaintance’s bike, even though the acquaintance was trying to de-escalate the situation.Franco’s claims of self-defence were brushed away emphatically by the prosecutor Richard Wright KC, who said it was a case of “a young man with a cocky swagger, on drugs with his girlfriend, who doesn’t like the fact that a young man has spoken back at him and is getting ready to use his knife before Ahmad has even walked towards him”.The defence claimed Franco’s experiences as a victim of knife crime had made him defensive and that he had mistaken Ahmad’s vape for a knife.Gill Batts KC, defending, said the prosecution had “chosen at best to minimise and at worst ignore the part that Ahmad had played in this” and that the 16-year-old’s actions had “caused a chain of events” that led to his death.Temporary Det Supt Damian Roebuck called Ahmad’s murder “horrific” and said the loss of his life in “such a pointless, motiveless attack in our communities at the hands of someone he never met is an absolute tragedy for him and all those who knew him”.Explore more on these topicsCrimeWest YorkshireHuddersfieldKnife crimeSyriaMiddle East and north AfricafeaturesShareReuse this content"

Every year that passes, because of the two-child limit, more children move into poverty and the evidence is there for all to see.”The education secretary is running to be deputy leader of her party afterthe resignationof Angela Rayner last month. She told the Guardian she was seeking the role in part to be given a mandate from Labour members to push the prime minister to do more on child poverty.“I have pushed to take action ahead of the budget – and that’s why we’re expanding free school meals, which will lift 100,000 children out of poverty – but there is more to do. That is why I’m seeking a mandate from members to do more.”Asked if she was seeking a mandate specifically to push for the removal of the cap, and not only for it to be tapered, she agreed. “Members should know that if I’m at that cabinet table, I know what needs to happen and I know what we need to do,” she added.The two-child benefit cap was introduced by the Conservatives in 2017, and is now estimated to affect more than 10% of children in the UK. The Child Poverty Action Groupsays scrapping itwould lift 350,000 children out of poverty, but doing so would eventually costan estimated £3.6bn a year– money the chancellor will struggle to find given the multibillion-pound shortfall she faces.Phillipson said: “I’ve campaigned on this for a very, very long time. It’s something that brought me intoLabourpolitics and it’s what drives me today. But I’ve never at any point suggested that the main consideration here is about the cost of the policy. I have been clear that this policy comes with a significant price tag, but I’ve never said that, for example, there’s no money left to pay for this.”The education secretary is engaged in a fierce battle with her former cabinet colleague Lucy Powell for the deputy leadership of the party.Polls suggestPowell is heading for victory, but Phillipson has the backing of more unions.Yes, a working-class woman will be Labour’s next deputy leader, but what about those still sidelined? | Jennifer Jasmine WhiteRead morePowellhas pitched herselfas the candidate who will be best able to challenge Starmer openly, given he recently demoted her from the cabinet.But Phillipson told the Guardian she thought some of those supporting her rival – including the leftwing campaign group Momentum – were doing it deliberately to damage the Labour party.“I think we will be more effective in doing what Labour members want to see if we can have those frank conversations within closed rooms – where members’ voices are heard, but not where we’re throwing stones from the outside,” she said.“And I also would add that when you look at some of those like Momentum, who are endorsing my opponent, they are doing so because they want to destabilise the Labour party.”After a summer in which Labour wasaccused ofletting Nigel Farage dominate the headlines with anti-migration messages, Phillipson said it was important to tackle him head on, accusing him of taking his Reform UK party into a “very extreme space”.But she added that the best way to do so was to improve public services rather than insult Farage personally. “The key test, when it comes to tackling Reform, will be about how we show and not tell the difference that this Labour government is making,” she said.Explore more on these topicsBridget PhillipsonPovertySocial exclusionBenefitsLabour party deputy leadershipLabournewsShareReuse this content"

Some of the pictures were sent through social media, while others were printed and included in a letter to Amelie that arrived at the McCanns’ home.“I didn’t like it, it made me feel very uncomfortable,” she said. “She had clearly edited the pictures to make me look more like her, which was quite disturbing. I knew I didn’t look like that, I knew it had been changed.”She also spoke about the effect of the alleged stalking on her mother, Kate, who gave evidence on Wednesday about being confronted at home by Wandelt and her co-defendant, Karen Spragg, 61, who is from Cardiff.“I think my mum found it the hardest. [She] was harassed by Julia more than the rest of us and I think it definitely took its toll on her and her wellbeing,” she said. “It’s upsetting when someone’s begging you to believe them and playing with your emotions, to the point you are questioning yourself and doubting yourself. And I think my mum really struggled with that. Her saying ‘I’m your daughter’.”She said her mother had been “very stressed and on edge”.In a witness statement read to the court, Sean McCann said he personally had not been too badly affected by Wandelt’s alleged stalking, but he had been upset she was attracting online attention, with people saying “nasty and unfair” things about his parents.If Wandelt was not mentally ill and was “fully aware she is not Madeleine, yet makes these claims she is, that will be very upsetting for me”, he said. “I do not believe she is my sister. The fact Julia is doing this has caused me a great deal of stress and I find it deeply disturbing.”Wandelt and Spragg deny stalking the McCann family.The trial continues.Explore more on these topicsUK newsnewsShareReuse this content"

The attacker has been trying to extort a ransom from the company. No full credit card details or passwords were seized.The breach was made public last week but the potential number of lost photo IDs emerged on Wednesday.

The court heard Dogan, a married father, made contact with Gisèle Pelicot’s then husband, Dominique Pelicot, in an online chatroom called “without her knowledge”, where Pelicot was looking for men to come to his home to rape his wife after he had drugged her into a comatose state.Gisèle Pelicot’s lawyer, Antoine Camus, had told the court: “We hope the jury will say loud and clear that in this country, human rights are also women’s rights – that consent is personal, not delegated. Consent is obtained directly and not by proxy from a husband.”Dominique Pelicot, one of the worst sex offenders in modern French history, wassentenced to 20 years in prisonlast year for drugging his then wife and inviting dozens of men to rape her in her home in the Provence village of Mazan over a period of almost a decade of their marriage.Fifty other men were foundguiltyin a high-profile trial last year, and Dogan was the only man to appeal against his conviction. He was initially sentenced to nine years in prison, a sentence raised on Thursday to 10 years. The lead state prosecutor, Dominique Sie, had argued he should serve 12 years, because he “absolutely refuses to take any responsibility”.Dogan had first sent Dominique Pelicot sexually explicit photos and then driven an hour from his village in Provence to rape Gisèle Pelicot, after telling his wife he was going out, the court heard.View image in fullscreenGisèle Pelicot and her son, Florian Pelicot, leaves court after the verdict.Photograph: Christophe Simon/AFP/Getty ImagesPelicot, who was brought from solitary confinement in prison to brieflygive evidenceat the appeal trial, told the court that Dogan had known his wife had been was “sedated” and he said to men by phone: “I’m looking for someone to abuse my wife after I’ve put her to sleep without her knowledge.”The courtroom became a focus point for a broader debate on rape culture in society as Dogan continued to say he was innocent and had not committed rape, arguing that because Gisèle Pelicot’s husband had invited him into the bedroom, his actions had been acceptable.The jury in the Nîmes appeals court was shown video evidence of Gisèle Pelicot’s limp body, unconscious and snoring in a comatose state, while a smiling Dogan committed rape repeatedly over a timeframe of what police said was three and a half hours. The presiding judge said she had been at risk of death by suffocation. The state prosecution said there was no doubt that she had been unconscious and had not consented.Dogan told the court the videos were simply “sex scenes” and denied it was rape. He said what he did was “a sexual act”, not rape. He told the court: “I never raped.” He said Gisèle Pelicot’s husband had invited him to the house, and therefore it was OK. He said he was manipulated by Dominique Pelicot. “I wanted to stop,” Dogan told the court. “I continued because he reassured me.”Asked if he wanted to make a final statement to the court, Dogan said: “I never wanted to harm that lady.”Gisèle Pelicot, who was applauded upon leaving court each day by crowds gathered to support her, told Dogan in court: “You haven’t understood. When are you going to recognise you raped me? It’s a crime to rape an unconscious woman. When did I ever give you consent? Never.”Gisèle Pelicot, 72, became an international feminist hero after she waived her right to anonymity in the trial last year when she said: “Shame must change sides.”Sie, turning to Gisèle Pelicot in court, said Dogan’s refusal to take responsibility showed that: “Shame has not yet changed sides. Society is maybe in the process of that, perhaps driven by the collective awareness brought by the exposure of your case.”Sie said Dogan’s claims of innocence showed how rape culture was still widespread in society as part of “archaic” forms of “male domination”. He said: “Now we must change rape culture to a culture of consent.”Sie told Dogan: “As long as you refuse to admit it, it’s not just a woman, it’s an entire sordid social system that you are endorsing.”Dogan was born in Turkey and at the age of five came toFrance, where his father worked as a concierge. The court heard that his father was violent and that Dogan began smoking cannabis at the age of 10. When Dogan was 17 he was stopped by police for dealing drugs and his father kicked him out of home. He served time in prison for drug dealing in his early 20s and had worked as a builder but had experienced periods of homelessness.He was married and had a son with Down’s syndrome, for whom he was the principal carer as his wife worked in a school canteen. The court heard his wife did not know he had regular sexual encounters outside their marriage. His defence said this was his way of coping with his stressful life. Dogan had told a court psychologist that once a year he sought paid sex on his birthday. His lawyers told the court he had arthritis triggered by the stress of the first trial.Explore more on these topicsGisèle PelicotGisèle Pelicot rape trialFranceRape and sexual assaultEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Ukrainian drones have regularly struck deep inside Russia.Speaking at a meeting with Azerbaijan’s president Ilham Aliyev in Tajikistan’s capital of Dushanbe, where both were attending a summit of the former Soviet nations, Putin pledged to punish those responsible and provide compensation.Azerbaijani authorities had said the Embraer 190 jet was hit accidentally by Russian fire, then tried to land in western Kazakhstan, where it crashed and killed 38 of 67 people onboard.Days after the crash, Putin apologized to Aliyev for what he called a “tragic incident” but stopped short of acknowledging responsibility. Aliyev, meanwhile, criticised Moscow for trying to “hush up” the incident.The controversy over the crash has roiled the previously warm ties between Moscow and Baku. Their relations were further destabilised by deaths of ethnic Azerbaijanis rounded up by police in a Russian city in June and a series of arrests of Russians in Azerbaijan.Speaking to Aliyev on Thursday, Putin said Russian air defences that had been targeting a Ukrainian drone fired on the Azerbaijani airliner because of a “technical malfunction”, adding that two missiles exploded just 10 metres (33 feet) away from the passenger jet.He said: “The Russian side will obviously do everything to provide compensation and give legal assessment to all responsible officials’ action.“Of course, these words related to this tragedy, aimed at supporting – morally supporting – the families do not solve the main problem: we can’t bring back to life those who died as a result of the tragedy.”The Russian president voiced hope for overcoming the strain between the countries and fully rebuilding the ties. “I hope that our cooperation not only will be restored, but continue in the spirit of our relations, the spirit of our alliance,” he said.Aliyev, for his part, thanked Putin for investigating the cause of the plane’s downing. “I would like to thank you for keeping the situation under your personal control,” he said.The Azerbaijani leader said they had a chance to discuss a “broad and positive” bilateral agenda, voicing hope that “the messages we are sending today to our societies will meet a positive response”.Explore more on these topicsRussiaAzerbaijanVladimir PutinnewsShareReuse this content"

It marks the film-maker’s first feature since he wasaccused of sexual misconductby a number of women in 2017. He had denied the claims.Melania’s $40m Amazon deal: another sign Bezos is capitulating to Donald Trump | Margaret SullivanRead moreThe official description states that Melania will show us the world through her eyes as “she orchestrates inauguration plans, navigates the complexities of the White House transition, and re-enters public life with her family”. The documentary will also include “exclusive footage capturing critical meetings, private conversations, and never-before-seen environments”. She also acts as a producer on the project.“We started the production in November, and we are shooting right now, so it’s a day-to-day life, what I’m doing, what kind of responsibilities I have,” Melania said in aninterview on Fox & Friends in January. “It’s day-to-day, from transition team to moving to the White House, packing, establishing my team, the first lady office, moving into the White House, what it takes to make the residence your home, to hire the people that you need.”She added that the film was partly a result of the success of her memoir. The Guardian’s Lloyd Greencalledthat “a 180-page exercise in buck-passing and blame-dodging”.Amazon reportedly spent $40m for the rights to the documentary. The company’s founder and executive chairman, Jeff Bezos, attended Donald Trump’s inauguration earlier this year. Bezos had previously beenunder firefor allegedly barring the Washington Post for endorsing Trump’s rival Kamala Harris in the election. He laterdefendedthe decision as a way to avoid media bias.Alongside the documentary,Amazonwill also release a three-part docuseries on Melania showing her life travelling between New York, Washington DC and Palm Beach.Ratner’s credits include the Rush Hour franchise and Red Dragon. After multiple women, including the actors Natasha Henstridge and Olivia Munn,accused himof sexual misconduct, his deal with Warner Bros was ended.In 2023, he moved to Israel andcalled himselfa “proud Zionist” on Instagram. Ratner is also rumoured to be working on a documentary about the Abraham Accords and is known to be friendly with Benjamin Netanyahu,sharing picturesof them together on his social media.Melania will be released in cinemas on 30 January and will stream on Amazon Prime at a later date.Explore more on these topicsDocumentary filmsMelania TrumpDonald TrumpAmazon Prime VideoAmazonnewsShareReuse this content"

There is an urgent need for long-term thinking and workforce investment, alongside investment in AI tools, to ensure sustainable and productive employment.”In addition, two-fifths (39%) of leaders said entry-level roles had already been reduced or cut as a result of efficiencies made by using AI tools to conduct research or carry out administrative and briefing tasks.While more than half of respondents said they felt lucky to have started their career before the use of AI became widespread, just over half (53%) also said they believed that the benefits of AI implementation in companies would outweigh the disruption to the workforce.AI is being rapidly adopted by UK businesses, according to the business leaders surveyed, and three-quarters (76%) said they expect new tools to deliver tangible benefits to their organisations within the next 12 months.Businesses said they were mainly investing in AI to improve productivity and efficiency, as well as cutting costs and filling skills gaps.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It is a significant bet on Hong Kong and China, and comes amid ongoing criticism over Heng Seng’s exposure toChina’s real estate downturn.HSBC, which makes the majority of its profits in Hong Kong andChina, has reportedly been pushing Hang Seng to get rid of bad debts linked to the property market.Its chief executive, Georges Elhedery, who took over last year, said the deal represented a “significant investment into Hong Kong’s economy, underscoring our confidence in this market and commitment to its future as a leading global financial centre, and as a super-connector between international markets and mainland China”.The news comes a year after Elhedery announced a company-wide shake-up that involved massive cost cuts, exiting certain markets, and dividing the bank’s operations into eastern and western markets. The move brieflysparked rumours of a HSBC break-up, which were later quashed.HSBC said that it would not be launching any further share buybacks over the next three quarters in light of the £10bn deal, in order to build up its capital levels – referring to the financial cushion that ensures banks can absorb shocks and protect customers from potential losses. That detail appears to have disappointed shareholders, with HSBC’s London-listed shares falling 5% on Thursday.AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould said: “Like a toddler who has been told they can’t have another biscuit, HSBC shareholders are stamping their feet on news they won’t be getting any share buybacks for the next few quarters.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

However, Lloyds’ stock fell by more than 3% on Thursday morning after it indicated the bigger than expected costs. Close Brothers shares plunged by nearly 10%.The car finance scandal payouts: what does ruling mean and how much compensation could you get?Read moreTheFinancial Conduct Authorityput lenders’ total compensation bill at £8.2bn, although it could rise to £9.7bn. This is at the bottom end of its earlier forecast range of between £9bn and £18bn.However, Lloyds said on Thursday: “Based on our initial analysis and the characteristics of the proposed scheme, an additional provision is likely to be required which may be material.”The bank added that there were uncertainties around the interpretation and implementation of the proposals, and that further analysis was needed.The high street bank in Februaryset aside a further £700m to cover compensation paymentsto customers, taking its total provision to almost £1.2bn.Its provisions have weighed on its financial performance, pushing its 2024 pre-tax profits down by 20%, to just under £6bn. At the time, RBC Capital estimated that the bank could ultimately be on the hook for up to £4.6bn.The car finance scandal is the biggest since the payment protection insurance (PPI) mis-selling debacle, where 34 million consumers received an average of about £1,000 each. Lloyds was also the most exposed to that scandal.Steve Clayton, the head of equity funds at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: “The statement from Lloyds was not in the market’s playbook and the shares have reacted badly, erasing yesterday’s gains, with Close Brothers similarly impacted.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

However, it remains confident of 30% year-on-year growth in profits.Secure Trust is in the process of exiting vehicle finance, which may require additional provisions for onerous supplier contracts, which would be treated as exceptional costs.The motor and property finance specialist S&U released upbeat financial results, reporting a profit before tax of £15.6m for six months to 5 August, up 22% on a year earlier.

The trade has even been given a moniker: the “debasement trade”. But what does it mean?What is the debasement trade?Debasement is the act of reducing the quality or value of something. Henry VIII was behind one of the most notorious examples in history: the “great debasement” saw the amount of gold and silver in coins substituted with cheaper base metals such as copper to fund his lavish lifestyle as well as wars with France and Scotland. It earned him the nickname Old Coppernose when silver started to wear off the coins featuring his face.The modern debasement trade involves investors moving away from fiat currencies, such as the dollar, in favour of “harder” assets that provide safety from the risk of rampant inflation.The trade – a hot topic in the markets this month – is being driven by anxiety that governmentswill not, or cannot, rein in their borrowing by cutting spending and raising taxes. The concern is that politicians may take control of their central banks, allowing them to run persistently high deficits and prioritise debt financing over price stability.Why is the debasement trade in vogue?Concerns about fiat currencies – which are issued by governments without the backing of a hard asset such as gold – have been rising for years. But interest in the debasement issue has gathered pace as a result of the Trump administration’s trade and fiscal policies, which have threatened to drive the already huge US national debt even higher than its current $37tn.Enthusiasm for the trade has risen as investors have observed central banks cutting interest rates even though inflation remains over target: Trump hasnoisily demanded hefty cuts to US borrowing costs.The US government shutdown,France’s inability to agree a budget, and the factJapan’s next prime ministersupports aggressive public spending, have added to concerns about debt sustainability in large economies.Fears about money printing have been swirling since central bankers began their stimulus packages during the financial crisis. But broader confidence in the global financial system appears to be weakening further, in a world of weaker growth and rising debts.How are investors playing the debasement trade?They are spending more of their fiat currency reserves on assets that cannot be printed, such as precious metals and bitcoin.It’s “the familiar pattern of dollar debasement against alternative reserve assets amid Washington dysfunction”, according to JP Morgan analysts this week.View image in fullscreenIllustration: JP MorganInflows into gold exchange-traded funds hit a record high in the last quarter, according to data from the World Gold Council, amid macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty.What impact is it having?Some asset prices are hitting the roof. Gold has had more highs than a 1970s rock star this year,hitting $4,000 an ounce for the first time on Wednesday. It has surged by 50% during 2025.Graph showing price of gold since 1969Gold prices are now up a stunning 18% since the Fed's dovish pivot at Jackson Hole on August 22. The Dollar is stable. This should be giving governments around the world serious pause. Markets fear global debasement in the face of post-COVID debt overhangs. This is all fiscal...pic.twitter.com/4vI7RywswA— Robin Brooks (@robin_j_brooks)October 6, 2025Bitcoin is also having a rollicking year, up more than 20% since January, hitting the $125,000 mark for the first time on Monday.But the dollar, which underpins the global financial system, has dropped by about 9% since the start of the year against a basket of other currencies, as its status as the global reserve currency has come under strain.Ken Griffin, the founder and chief executive of the hedge fund Citadel, said this week that investors were looking for ways to “effectively de-dollarise and de-risk their portfolios vis-a-vis US sovereign risk”.“Inflation is substantially above target and substantially above target in all forecasts for next year. And it’s part of the reason the dollar’s depreciated by about 10% in the first half of this year. It’s the single biggest decline in the US dollar in six months, in 50 years,” Griffin told the Citadel Securities future of global markets conference.Government long-term borrowing costs have also risen, as investors have shunned long-dated bonds out of fear that inflation will eat away their value. This is the worst decade on record for government bonds, according to recent Deutsche Bank data.The weakness of the US dollar, and the rise in alternative assets, raises speculation that bitcoin could serve as a credible reserve asset alongside gold.View image in fullscreenIllustration: Deutsche Bank“A strategic bitcoin allocation could emerge as a modern cornerstone of financial security, echoing gold’s role in the 20th century,” suggested Deutsche Bank’s Marion Laboure and Camilla Siazon this week, who predicted both assets were likely to feature on central bank balance sheets by 2030.Can it last, or will it end in tears?Goldman Sachs has predicted that gold will keep rising over the next year or so – it has raised its price forecast for the end of 2026 to $4,900 an ounce.There are plenty of sage heads warning that asset prices have risen too high this year, pumped up by enthusiasm over artificial intelligence. Comparisons with the dotcom boom of the late 1990s are rampant. But what goes up has a habit of keeping going up, beforeit all turns sour.The billionaire hedge fund manager Paul Tudor Jones suggested this week we could see a surge in stock prices before the bull market tops out. He told CNBC:My guess is that I think all the ingredients are in place for some kind of a blow-off.History rhymes a lot, so I would think some version of it is going to happen again. If anything, now is so much more potentially explosive than 1999.Gold is also acting as a haven from concerns that the artificial intelligence stock boom may collapse, asbig AI players announce a wave of interconnected, or “circular”, deals.Shares in those companies have soared this year, pushing the wider stock markets to fresh highs, in the Fomo (fear of missing out) trade, as investors try to catch a piece of the AI boom.Explore more on these topicsBusinessStock marketsGoldBitcoinCurrenciesCryptocurrenciesCommoditiesexplainersShareReuse this content"

It not only draws hundreds of thousands of players to pack out vast convention halls each year, but it also hosts professionals, offering them a chance to get their games into the hands of fans, and gives industry hopefuls a shot at passing their résumés to developers. For those based outside the US, it is the biggest event of the year by far. It is the International Game Developers Association (IGDA) Foundation’s first year here, and executive director Alyssa Walles is excited.The IGDA Foundation provides professional development for underrepresented and marginalised people hoping to enter the video game industry, a crucial service considering the many barriers prospective producers, developers and writers face. Though Walles is fairly new to the IGDA Foundation, having joined three years ago, she is a video game industry veteran. She knows how crucial it is to help those who aren’t born into privileged situations, who can’t afford to travel across the globe to conventions, or have not had traditional schooling in computer design or coding.View image in fullscreenGamescom hosts video game fans and industry professionals.Photograph: Imago/Alamy“I was part of the launch team of PlayStation in Europe, and I was the only woman in the room most of the time,” Walles says. “So I am so happy to see that change.” But she knows there is more work to be done.The IGDA Foundation started by funding trips for a select group to the annual Game Developers Conference in San Francisco, an expensive endeavour that often excludes hundreds of developers from marginalised communities or more remote regions of the world. When the Covid pandemic redefined video game events, the IGDA Foundation had to get creative – that’s when former executive director Nika Nour came up with the Virtual Exchange, a six-week online programme that pairs grantees with a veteran game industry coach. Out of hundreds of annual applications, the IGDA Foundation selects grantees from three main pillars: games career professionals looking for more senior roles, professionals trying to transition into the games industry and recent graduates.View image in fullscreenAlyssa Walles of the IGDA Foundation.Photograph: Courtesy IGDA FoundationWalles says: “My favourite example of someone in our cohort who has work experience but is trying to break into the games industry is this young man from Nigeria. He’s a home builder, he’s project managing every day, building houses – and he codes. He wants to take that project management experience and become a producer in video games.”For Walles and many other industry veterans who become mentors with the IGDA Foundation, it is about using their experience to ensure the industry has a strong and diverse future. “I’m 65, I’m not afraid about saying that … I’m on the back end of my career, and I’m here to give back,” she says.But the IGDA Foundation, like so many other programmes dedicated to making the video game industry and tech spaces more equitable, has faced frustrating challenges in the last few years. After meteoric growth during the pandemic, the industry has seen record redundancies. Companies are telling Walles they don’t have money for the foundation, which she finds hard to believe (“I know you have $5,000”), and though the IGDA Foundation isn’t government-funded, the Trump administration and Elon Musk’s “department of government efficiency” (Doge) have attacked diversity, equity and inclusivity institutions, which forces them to rethink how they market their programme and how to approach potential donors.“There have been several nonprofits that have had to close in our space.

Last year, she saw a story in a newsletter about how a solo developer made significant money from a single piece of downloadable content (DLC) sold in a Steam bundle. “I reached out to the IDGA Foundation’s alumni network and said, ‘I want to do a Steam event with DLC,’ and someone stepped forward to manage it. We created Download for Charity, an event we had in May – we had 24 games participate and raised $24,000,” Walles says. She has also organised game jams with unlikely collaborators and a recent porting initiative to help developers get their games on to Android phones.This dogged pursuit of funding is a testament to Walles’ dedication to the programme and to the marginalised people it serves. Walles’ hope for the future of the IGDA Foundation is simple: “We just want enough money to sustain us so we can provide these programmes for the people who need them around the world.”Explore more on these topicsGamesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Before a tour of regional village halls in Wales, he talks creating songs in his first language – and why English is the best for swearingThu 9 Oct 2025 03.00 EDTShareYou can’t swear properly in Welsh. I know this, because I’m having a swearing lessonynGymraegfrom 55-year-oldSuper Furry Animalsfrontman, and solo artist, Gruff Rhys. Gruffudd Maredudd Bowen Rhys was born in Haverfordwest in west Wales, grew up in the Welsh-speaking town of Bethesda in north Wales, and has lived in Cardiff since the 90s. His first band, aged 16, were called Ffa Coffi Pawb. The translation is “Everybody’s coffee beans”. But say it phonetically in Welsh and it sounds quite rude.“Swearing in Welsh is a bit like swearing in Spanish, where you describe terrible things about someone’s mother or something,” Rhys explains. For example, in Spanish, “la madre que te parió” translates as “the woman that birthed you” which means, well, the MF word. “You can create offence for sure, but English is special, in that there’s all these taboo swearwords,” says Rhys. “So Welsh uses English swearwords because they are instantly offensive.”I’ve come to Cardiff to meet Rhys ahead of his new Welsh-language solo album, Dim Probs. This is the fourth time he’s recorded an album entirely in his first language – one with Super Furry Animals (Mwng, still the biggest selling Welsh-language album of all time), and three of his nine solo albums.View image in fullscreenShow me magic … Gruff Rhys on stage with Super Furry Animals in 1999.Photograph: Peter Pakvis/RedfernsRhys has been involved in Welsh-language music since before he could shave. There’s a 2024 S4C documentary on iPlayer named afterFfa Coffi Pawbthat tells the story of the progressive DIY scene he grew up in, which rebelled against Thatcherism and the orthodoxy of much Welsh culture at the time (“drinking beer in a rugby shirt,” as Rhys puts it in the doc), while celebrating the language itself. One early archive clip shows him, voice still unbroken, discussing the punk fanzine he had recently set up.“I spoke Welsh with my friends and most of the subjects at school were taught in Welsh,” Rhys recalls. He picked up his first English (“Well, Anglo-American”) word, “cookie”, from watching Sesame Street. “There’s no wonder that I make music in the Welsh language,” he continues. “It’s stranger, really, that I’ve put out so many albums in English …”Many of those albums came courtesy of Super Furry Animals. Formed in 1993, the band featured Rhys and Ffa Coffi Pawb drummer Dafydd Ieuan, along with Huw Bunford and Guto Pryce of Welsh-language punk band U Thant and – as unbelievable as it sounds – actor Rhys Ifans on lead vocals (he soon departed when his acting career took off). Later fronted by Rhys, the band were signed to Creation in 1996, where – legend has it – label boss Alan McGee asked if they could sing in English, not realising from Rhys’s strong Welsh accent that he already was.The group soon built a reputation for musical experimentation and wild onstage presentation, including yeti costumes and inflatable bears, and for a period arriving at festivals in their own customised tank. They have been dormant since 2016 – their last single, Bing Bong, was released to celebrate the Welsh national football team’s qualification for the 2016 Euros – but havejust announced2026 tour dates.Rhys’s career away from the Furries has been no less idiosyncratic. There has beenNeon Neon, his electropop duo with Boom Bip, guest appearances for Mogwai and Gorillaz, and a dizzyingly varied array of solo records, including an effort inspired by a mountain on the border of China and North Korea (Seeking New Gods)and a concept album about 18th-century Welsh explorer John Evans (American Interior).What’s it like writing in Welsh, I wonder? Do you quickly run out of things to rhyme with Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogoch? Or is it like Eminem, who has done a rap abouthow thingsdorhyme with orange? “It’s a playful language,” he says, after laughing at my rubbish analogy. “I think there’s slightly fewer pop cliches in Welsh – it’s still being invented as a pop language in comparison to English.”View image in fullscreenHighly strung … Gruff Rhys.Photograph: Francesca Jones/The GuardianWe chat briefly about the decline of the spoken language: 50 years ago, Welsh was spoken by 80% of people in some communities; today it’s only 30%, though there has been a resurgence in recent years. And, Rhys tells me, there’s simultaneously been more activism for the Welsh language, in that it’s become far more visible, thanks in large part to the 1993 Welsh Language Act that ensured that Welsh was put on an equal footing with English in Wales. Today “even the self-service checkout speaks Welsh”, he smiles.We’re chatting over cups of tea at St Catherine’s Church Community Hall, Pontcanna, where local odd-job man Clive has been roped into letting us in for the morning. (“You found where the tea was?” he interrupts, helpfully clearing away our dirty mugs.) Rhys’s current tour, you see, includes a run at various village, church, town and civic halls. “I was asked to find somewhere that looked like a rural Welsh venue,” he adds, of today’s photoshoot. “I’ve been to a child’s birthday party and a wedding here, so I thought: it’s gotta be St Catherine’s.”Rhys’s tour is rational as well as romantic. “It’s just practical, really, putting out a Welsh-language album, then touring it in areas where they speak the language,” he continues. “There’s some beautiful venues. There’s a set of industrial circuits built up in the UK for pop music. Sometimes it’s great to leave those pop markets and play where you really want to. I don’t want to over-romanticise it. I’ll just be playing in villages and towns, to maybe not enough people …”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Does he know his chaffinches from his song thrushes? “No. I was terrible. I didn’t have a clue.”With Clive keen to shut up shop (“Are you aware you’re in the midst of a celebrity?” I ask), Rhys offers to give me a lift back to the train station in his father-in-law’s Jeep – his own faithful van of 20 years has unfortunately just blown up. On the way back to the car, Rhys is keen to show me around a local Welsh bookshop, where – for the first time – I hear him speak Welsh to the nice lady behind the counter. I’d like to buy a card for my mum’s Welsh friend, Glenda, who didn’t speak English until she was 16. I opt for one that says “Ti ym fy ffefryni yn bendant”. I hope it’s appropriate.Back in the car, chat turns to other Welsh celebs. “I love Charlotte Church. We’ve done a few gigs with her. I think she did sing at one of my concerts. I really admire people who can articulate political ideas,” he says, referencing her vocal opposition to austerity and Israel’s war on Gaza. “I’m always there if she needs me …”Rhys talks about one of his most unlikely Welsh-language projects: 2117/Hedd Wyn, the opera for which he wrote the libretto, about a group of post-apocalyptic Welsh schoolchildren learning about the life and work of the famous Welsh poet, who died at the battle of Passchendaele in the first world war. Hedd Wyn’s is a story that “has been told many times before, so I wanted to tell it differently. It was for a film that was abandoned, but we’d already recorded the opera with the 90-piece orchestra. It came out on CD but it was never performed. There’s talks of performing it, so I’ve got that on the back burner.” Would he like to release music in any other language? Rhys isn’t sure. He’s already done English, Welsh and – briefly on his 2019 album, Pang! – Zulu.Gruff Rhys: ‘We sold the Super Furry Animals tank to Don Henley from the Eagles’Read moreRhys drops me at Cardiff station.

It’s a movie that could have been made at any time in the past 50 years, with high-concept provocations and talking points that feel like something from the age of Kubrick’s Clockwork Orange or Ôshima’s Max Mon Amour, or even, indeed, Skolimowski’s The Shout.In present day England, Tommy (played by Anson Boon) is a teenage kid completely obnoxious and out of control: clubbing and bingeing booze and coke, evidently paid for with the monetisation income from hugely successful social media streams which show him racing stolen cars with his similarly odious mates. But Tommy’s online profile has caught the disapproving eye of Chris (Graham), a middle-aged road-safety campaigner and family values enthusiast, who wears a wig and has high-up contacts in the police and Home Office.When Tommy is staggering stupefied around the streets after another massive night, Chris kidnaps him and chains him up in the basement of his handsome country house, perhaps paid for with his wife’s money; this is Kathryn, a deeply depressed silent wraith of a woman played by Riseborough. With the help of a baton and Taser for punishment, and various treats and privileges for good behaviour – such as a longer chain so Tommy can reach the actual lavatory, rather than using the bucket – Chris is on a mission to train Tommy to be a good son to them, and an exemplary older brother to their 10-year-old boy Jonathan (Kit Rakusen), who at all times maintains a fixed smile and saucer-eyed expression of suppressed fear. In fact, the film’s most realistic moment of sociopathic cruelty is Jonathan maintaining that obedient smile, even as his eyes are brimming with tears, while Chris irritably tries to teach him algebra. But Tommy might yet befriend the couple’s exploited Macedonian cleaner (Monika Frajczyk).In the film’s Kubrickian moments, Chris makes Tommy watch his shameful TikTok videos, but in a spirit of sentimental leniency allows him to sit down (with the manacle around his neck of course) to watch Ken Loach’s Kes, clearly believing he will be duly instructed by this story of how a kestrel being trained exalts and civilises both animal and delinquent boy. And Tommy duly starts to acclimatise to the new normal and Kathryn comes out of her shell. The movie’s ironies and cruelties clatter across the screen, but Komasa also allows the audience to consider who it is Chris really wants to train. There is something very theatrical about Good Boy – I can imagine this on the London West End stage. Perhaps it would be much less with a lesser cast: Graham and Riseborough execute the bland nastiness expertly.Good Boy screened at theLondon film festival.Explore more on these topicsFilmLondon film festival 2025Drama filmsLondon film festivalAndrea RiseboroughStephen GrahamFestivalsreviewsShareReuse this content"

Maybe the movie documentary form is something that naturally comes alive when showcasing particularly vivid still images. Here is another outstanding example, from writer-director Yemi Bamiro, about the remarkable career of Kwame Brathwaite, a photographer, musician and African American activist who was a unique politico-aesthete. With his brother Elombe, he virtually invented the phrase “Black Is Beautiful” in the 1960s by photographing the Grandassa Models in Harlem: young African American women who became the sensational template for beauty, doing away with the usual cosmetic products and the usual white standard of femininity.Black Is Beautiful became a radical rallying cry, an inspired three-word prose poem and manifesto for change. Simply to assert that black people were beautiful was a liberating force in art, politics and culture, and Brathwaite became a part of Black power’s pan-Africanist movement by photographing Muhammad Ali before his Rumble in the Jungle fight in Zaire in 1974. He was the exclusive photographer for the Jackson 5’s African tour, and became the house photographer for the Apollo theatre, building an amazing archive of black musicians, and with Elombe was the driving force behind bringing Nelson Mandela to speak in Harlem.His son Kwame Jr is interviewed and he recounts the family’s mission to get his father’s legacy and achievement properly recognised after he was hurtfully overlooked in Washington DC’s National Museum of African American History and Culture, opened by Barack Obama in 2016. And the film also recounts the inexpressibly painful origin of Brathwaite’s interest in photography: the horrendous images ofEmmett Till, the young African American lynching victim whose grieving mother defiantly asked for an open coffin so the brutal truth of racist violence could not be covered up.In this image of horror, Brathwaite found a kind of anti-epiphany which led him to images of beauty and of aspiration and community. And his images were eloquent of celebratory strength and often not overtly political: he curated a new iconography of empowerment around which political movements could gather. It is an exhilarating record.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe Long WaveFree weekly newsletterNesrine Malik and Jason Okundaye deliver your weekly dose of Black life and culture from around the worldEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Its finale is superb – and leaves you begging for moreEllen E JonesThu 9 Oct 2025 10.25 EDTLast modified on Thu 9 Oct 2025 10.27 EDTShareBack in 2018, when the first, web series of Adjani Salmon’s sitcom was released, its very existence was a boon to a British film/TV industry notably lacking diversity at all levels, and still in thrall to all-white period dramas. Here was a show about working-class Black Britons that both eschewed the usual drug-dealing stereotypesandwas created by a real-life Black person. Salmon co-wrote and starred as Kwabena Robinson, an aspiring film-maker struggling to get a career foothold, while also making his rent and cultivating a romance with doe-eyed love interest, Vanessa (Babirye Bukilwa).The fact that Dreaming Whilst Black was actually good, while not strictly necessary, definitely helped. The first full series won critical plaudits for its confident combination of creative industries satire, sensitive dramedy and surrealist touches. Now, the show is back for a second series, in which some of those easy, TV critic assumptions – about what progress looks like; about the intrinsic value of “diversity” and “representation” – are themselves questioned. It’s not a rude awaking from Kwabena’s dream exactly, but the arpeggio alarm on his iPhone 11 is definitely starting to sound.Kwabena’s long-distance relationship with Vanessa has fizzled and while he now has an agent (Jessica Hynes), he’s still struggling to find gainful, meaningful employment in his chosen field. This stance – overly fussy or honourably principled; take your pick – might go some way to explaining why, as Uncle Claude (Roger Griffiths) puts it: “Kwabena is the only Black man in England that never got any work out of Black Lives Matter.” (The elders are as merciless with their careers advice and their cussing out as ever.)So things have moved on, yet Dreaming Whilst Black remains rich with funny, true observations, about the hypocrisies and degradations of working in TV, and Black British life in general. Pertinent questions raised this series include: “Who the fuck wines to Giggs?” and “What has Jamaican national dish ackee and saltfish – served on rye, no less – got to do with celebrating Barbados?” Throughout, the showconsistently hits a tone that’s thoughtful-yet-funny and freewheeling-yet-focused.View image in fullscreen‘Rich with funny, true observations’ … Dreaming Whilst Black.Photograph: BBC/Big Deal Films/Gary MoyesOne bum note, at least on first viewing, is the white characters. While last series’ magnificent micro-aggressors included bravura turns from Peter Serafinowicz and Isy Suttie, they’ve now mostly been replaced by broader caricatures. There’s Amy’s new culturally appropriating colleague and the Essex-accented influencer who is the female lead in Sin and Subterfuge, the Bridgerton-esque period drama Kwabena is eventually hired to direct. She’s egregiously under-qualified, especially opposite a legendary Black actor like Rudolph Williams (Kobna Holdbrook-Smith). Yet the whims of “colourblind casting” demand it.Some of these performances take on different shades of nuance as the series progresses. (Is it OK that we’re laughing at the first assistant director, mainly because of his comedy Greek accent? Hold that thought …) But even if they hadn’t, the sheer novelty value of finding fault in the underwriting ofwhitesupporting characters would not be lost on this TV critic. Still, it’s no coincidence that one standout episode, Black Love, features none of these characters, instead paralleling the date nights of three Black couples at three different life stages.It’s always from Kwabena’s interactions with other Black characters that the most clarifying insights emerge. When, early on in the series, he screws over another aspiring director, rest assured the moment will return to haunt him. (There’s also an extra meta-textual bite in the fact that this character is played by Kayode Ewumi, veteran of more than one unjustly overlooked Black sitcom – whatever happened toEnterprice?That show was funny!) And when Rudolph classily confronts Kwabena about his people-pleasing directorial style, it reveals how the price of entry into a privileged elite – be it “whiteness” or a well-paid job in British media – is often our complicity in the exclusion of others.Meanwhile, it’s in the fantasy sequences that Dreaming Whilst Black seems to be having the most fun. If only Sin and Subterfuge had culture-melding costumes and dialogue like the period drama of Kwabena’s imaginings. (Sample line: “One doth think he is … a pussyclart!”) These are our regular reminders that Adjani is a much better writer than Kwabena, and thathisshow is directed with far more care and attention to detail.If you hadn’t clocked that already, witness how the finale masterfully ties up some storylines – in ways both neatly ironic and bitterly plausible – while leaving others open to tantalise us and, presumably, the commissioners. Please, good BBC sirs, deliver unto us series three with haste! And don’t spare the horses!Dreaming Whilst Black aired on BBC Three and is on iPlayer nowExplore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewTV comedyreviewsShareReuse this content"

Faces of victims, witnesses and possible perpetrators loom up to the cameras, sometimes in the harsh glare of headlights or flashlights as the officers approach, their faces and voices eloquent of wariness or panic or indignation or suspiciously contrived innocence. And we often incidentally glimpse the faces of the officers themselves, one standing by blankly while the other asks the questions with what sometimes seems like extraordinary diffidence – though perhaps this is because they know they are being recorded.We have already had the Netflix true-crime documentary American Murder: Gabby Petito, aboutthe slaying of an Instagram influencer by her boyfriend, whose main point of interest was body cam footage and in which, as in this film, the police seemed extraordinarily lax with the perpetrator. There is alsoBill Morrison’s Oscar-nominated short Incident, composed entirely of body cam film. Now comes Geeta Gandbhir’s documentary aboutthe grim case of Ajike Owens in Ocala, Florida, a woman of colour whose four young kids allegedly harassed and tormented her white neighbour, Susan Lorincz. In 2023, after an escalating series of neighbour-dispute incidents in which the police were repeatedly called, Lorincz shot Owens dead through her closed front door, when Owens went to Lorincz’s house to confront her about throwing objects at her children.The arresting officers found evidence that Lorincz had done online research into Florida’s “stand your ground” laws, which allow householders and others to shoot if there is a significant presumption of danger. The movie builds its story with the body cam footage generated during the repeated police visits to the scene before the killing, and then at the horrific and chaotic crime scene itself – prefaced by 911 audio material of Lorincz calling the police in a melodramatically shaky voice. There is also police cell footage of Lorincz which has a chilly, queasy fascination.The film does not really suggest anything too complicated about Lorincz, or any extenuating circumstance. She is clearly unstable, although the children are heard calling her “the Karen”, an ugly jibe. The film is presented as an example of how “stand your ground” laws generate senseless and tragic bloodshed. But the fact of gun ownership and the second amendment (that historic American constitutional privilege that thelate Charlie Kirk notoriously said made gun deaths a price worth paying) is not much highlighted.It is possible to watch the police interrogation scenes here and feel astonished at how little interest the officers took in this point. When did she buy her gun? Where (if anywhere) did she train in its use? Had she ever had occasion to fire it before? Where did she store it in the house? Was it just on the couch, loaded and ready? The police aren’t shown asking any of these surely relevant questions (though they may have done in footage that didn’t make the edit). Or is gun ownership so normal it would be like asking about microwaves or toasters?‘The world needs to know what happened to my baby’: inside devastating new police-body-cam film The Perfect NeighborRead moreFor what seemed to her neighbours a very long time, Lorincz was not even arrested and charged, only detained and even offered a hotel stay away from home for the night (another point of comparison, incidentally, with the Gabby Petito case). And when she was finally formally arrested in the holding cell, there is an extraordinary sequence in which Lorincz simply refuses to stand, refuses to put her wrists out for the cuffs, not aggressively, but with the politely self-pitying air of someone whose mental health means that she just can’t do it. Had the kid-gloves treatment up until that point encouraged her to think that this might actually work?It didn’t; and the jury’s verdict is saved for the closing credits.

Perhaps in a different concert it would have been perfectly possible to listen to his colossal orchestral workBecome Oceanand find it merely beautiful. Here, as the culmination of a brilliantly thought-through sequence played by the BBC Symphony Orchestra and conducted by Dalia Stasevska, its unsettling aspects struck home powerfully, too.All three works here were the kind that require the language of physics to describe them. This was music of ineluctable forces moving against each other, whether heavy or delicate: shifting tectonic plates and drifting clouds of gas.Anna Thorvaldsdottir’s ARCHORA, premieredat the BBC Proms in 2022, took us immediately into this listening world, the music first scattering high-frequency sounds against an elemental low note, then creating elusively shifting textures around a single, veering pitch. It’s a hugely effective work, simultaneously teeming and glacial.And, like so much written in the last 60 years, it owes at least a nod toLigeti’s Atmosphères– which required an even larger orchestra on stage. Here were sounds that seemed to come from the air or the ground rather than from any musical instrument. The extremes of pitch and loudness that had the players seated near the piccolo and percussion sticking their fingers in their ears for protection had the audience’s knuckles turning white, too.Out of the final silence of Atmosphères, Become Ocean emerged without a pause. It’s a 45-minute musical palindrome in which three cross-currents – strings, wind, brass – ebb and flow, creating troughs and huge peaks out of the interference. On one level it feels stable, even peaceful – and yet there’s an unyielding quality to this rise and fall that is profoundly disquieting. Benign and menacing sounds pass by each other, seemingly unrelated yet part of the same body: xylophones and harps – four of them, two upfront and two at the back – bubble above threatening bass drum. Stasevska shaped those long surges with absolute security and a clear view of the horizon; for the rest of us, the experience was immersive, the waves all-encompassing.On BBC Sounds until 7 NovemberExplore more on these topicsClassical musicBBC Symphony OrchestrareviewsShareReuse this content"

It’s as disorienting as it is immersiveAlexis PetridisThu 9 Oct 2025 07.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 9 Oct 2025 15.07 EDTShareSickElixir is not an album much interested in gently easing the listener into its darkly claustrophobic world. The first thing you hear is roughly approximate to the distressing sound of someone alternately gasping for breath and attempting to clear their passages of phlegm. It’s joined by a distorted bass drum overlaid with a metal-on-metal clank in lieu of a snare. There’s a weird noise somewhere between radio interference and the sound of fabric tearing, some incomprehensible, sonically warped and doom-laden guttural chanting, and harsh electronic tones that churn and screech. All this is in the opening minute of the first track: notice is served that Jamie Roberts’ latest album is probably not for everyone.View image in fullscreenThe artwork for SickElixir.This will hardly come as a shock to anyone with prior knowledge of his oeuvre. From the moment he started releasing music as Blawan – beginning in 2010 withFram, a twitchy, unsettling take on UK bass released by revered label Hessle Audio – Roberts has cut an impressively unbiddable figure. His style was marked by an industrial darkness that even seeped into his rework of Brandy’s lush R&B track I Wanna Be Down – something he has suggested may have to do with his spectacularly grim-sounding teenage job in a maggot farm, when his working days were soundtracked by the clanging of an industrial mincer. His biggest track to date is 2012’s Why They Hide Their Bodies Under My Garage, a relentless techno cut featuring a dive-bombing bassline and a warped sample of the Fugees. It crossed over into more mainstream DJs’ sets, albeit occasionally remixed into more palatable shapes.Roberts’ response was to stop releasing music as Blawan for the next three years. His 2018 debut album, Wet Will Always Dry, steadfastly declined to do the things that dance producers usually do when their canvas is expanded from the limitations of a 12in single (display the breadth of their musical range; shift styles and tempos; maybe throw in a couple of high-profile guest vocalists; attempt to create something that works as a home listening experience) and instead dished up eight unremitting slabs of dense, tough, club-focused techno. Recent years have seen Roberts work in a variety of styles – including the modular synth-driven beats of the album he recorded with Pariah as Karenn, and the industrial/doom metal made as one half of duo Persher – none of which much suggested a man desperate to break through to a wider audience.Blawan: Rabbit Hole – videoNor has the music he has released since signing to XL, a much larger record company than Roberts has traditionally worked with. SickElixir is certainly a more varied album than Wet Will Always Dry, rhythmically and musically. It’s surprisingly free of four-four beats, instead deploying rhythms that feel rooted in hip-hop, electro or, on Style Teef, footwork, and occasionally they have the glitchy, irregular quality of an old Aphex Twin or μ-Ziq tune. But the album is also heavier going emotionally. Wet Will Always Dry was aimed at the dancefloor: as dark-hued as it was, it allowed a certain sense of cathartic release. While SickElixir – which was recorded in the wake of a struggle with addiction and the overdose deaths of several friends – is served up in bite-size three-minute chunks, they’re crammed with sound, wilfully oppressive, spattered with sudden, jolting disruptions.‘Yes, there was a riot, but it was great’: Cabaret Voltaire on violent gigs, nuclear noise – and returning to mark 50 yearsRead moreThe vocals are frequently guttural growls or hoarse, panicked whispers. They’re usually manipulated to the point at which you can’t make out what they’re saying, but you get the feeling it’s probably not good news. You might call Rabbit Hole psychedelic – its gushes of electronic noise and looped vocals are certainly disorientating – but if it evokes anything about the drug experience it’s the moment of sudden, queasy propulsion when the chemicals start working a little too dramatically. On Don’t Worry We Happy and the title track, it feels as if Roberts is warping the cheerfully daft sounds of old happy hardcore rave until they sound mocking and nightmarish.It’s an album on which the atmosphere is so intense and all-pervading that even the most innocuous sounds take on an ominous air. The fluttering synth arpeggio on Creature Brigade feels eerie even before the entire track collapses into disturbing ambience. “Be quiet! Be quiet!” hisses a voice during Weirdos United: it feels threatening in context, but it’s apparently a recording of nothing more troubling than Roberts reacting to his pet dog’s snoring. When SickElixir ends, it feels like coming up for air, which gives you an idea of how immersive and overwhelming an experience it is. A headlong dive into a troubled mind working overtime, it isn’t a journey you might want to undertake on a nightly basis. That said, it’s a journey worth taking.This week Alexis listened toSay She She – Under the SunDependably fantastic Brooklyn alt-disco trio stir slow-jam Philly soul into their cocktail of influences, with heady results.Explore more on these topicsMusicAlexis Petridis's album of the weekElectronic musicExperimental musicreviewsShareReuse this content"

Probably not. Even so, this new audio version of Pride & Prejudice, made to mark the 250th anniversary of Austen’s birth, is a proper treat. Instead of a straightforward narration, Audible has thrown its considerable resources at an all-star dramatisation, adapted with skill and sensitivity by Lulu Raczka.Marianne Jean-Baptiste plays the voluble Mrs Bennet, who is keen to get her five daughters married off, if only the longsuffering Mr Bennet (Bill Nighy) would see the urgency of the situation. New on the scene are eligible singletons Mr Bingley (Toheeb Jimoh) and his monosyllabic friend Mr Darcy (Harris Dickinson). Darcy’s air of disdain irks the outspoken Elizabeth Bennet (Marisa Abela) and leads to some heated misunderstandings concerning the rakish Mr Wickham (Will Poulter) and Darcy’s imposing aunt, Lady Catherine (Glenn Close).The narrative here is pacier than the novel, but Austen’s sharp plotting and comic precision remain. Headphones are a must to enjoy the immersive soundscaping, which captures the rustle of a newspaper, the clatter of shoes on stairs and the whispered asides of the Bennet sisters at social gatherings as they cast an eye over the assembled bachelors. A minor gripe: the music, by Morgan Kibby, is lovely, but occasionally it threatens to swamp the dialogue. Nonetheless, this is an engaging adaptation that manages to make this well-known story feel remarkably fresh.Further listeningThe History GossipKatie Kennedy, WF Howes, 4hr 25minAn irreverent gallop through pivotal moments in history, tackling such vital questions as: was Anne of Cleves a minger?

Burey’s debut book – a combination of memoir, research, cultural commentary and interviews – seeks to unmask how companies co-opt identity, shifting the burden of institutional change on to individual workers who are already vulnerable.The impetus for the book lies partially in Burey’s own career trajectory: various roles across corporate retail, startups and in international development, filtered through her experience as a Black disabled woman. The dual posture that Burey experiences – a push and pull between asserting oneself and seeking protection – is the engine of Authentic.Itlands at a moment of collective fatigue with institutional platitudes across the US and beyond, as backlash to diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programs mount, and many organizations are scaling back the very structures that once promised change and reform. Burey enters that terrain to argue that retreating from authenticity rhetoric – that is, the corporate language that trivializes identity as a collection of aesthetics, quirks and hobbies, keeping workers preoccupied with managing how they are perceived rather than how they are treated – is not a solution; we must instead reframe it on our own terms.Through vivid anecdotes and interviews, Burey shows how marginalized workers –people of color, LGBTQ+ people, women, people with disabilities – learn early on to calibrate which self will “pass”. A vulnerability becomes a liability and people overcompensate by working to appear palatable. The act of “bringing your full self” becomes a projection screen on which all manner of expectations are cast: emotional labor, disclosure and constant performance of gratitude. In Burey’s words, we are asked to expose ourselves – but without the protections or the trust to survive what emerges.View image in fullscreen‘In Burey’s words, we are asked to expose ourselves – but without the protections or the trust to survive what emerges.’Photograph: Macmillan PublishingShe illustrates this dynamic through the story of Jason, a deaf employee who took it upon himself to educate his colleagues about deaf culture and communication norms. His willingness to share his experience – an act of openness the workplace often praises as “authenticity” – briefly made daily interactions easier. But as Burey shows, that progress was precarious. When staff turnover erased the informal knowledge Jason had built, the culture of access dissolved with it. “All of that knowledge left with them,” he notes wearily. What remained was the exhaustion of having to start over, of being made responsible for an institution’s learning curve. In Burey’s view, this is what it means to be asked to expose oneself without protection: to risk vulnerability in a system that applauds your transparency but refuses to codify it into policy. Authenticity becomes a trap when institutions depend on individual self-disclosure rather than structural accountability.Burey’s writing is at once lucid and lyrical. She marries intellectual rigor with a tone of kinship: an invitation for readers to lean in, to question, to dissent. For Burey, dissent at work is not loud rebellion but principled refusal – the act of resisting conformity in environments that demand gratitude for mere inclusion. To dissent, in her framing, is to question the stories institutions tell about fairness and belonging, and to decline participation in rituals that sustain inequity. It might look like naming bias in a meeting, opting out of unpaid “diversity” labor, or setting boundaries around how much of oneself is made available to the organization. Dissent, she suggests, is an assertion of self-respect in spaces that often reward compliance. It is a practice of integrity rather than defiance, a way of insisting that one’s humanity is not conditional on institutional approval.She also refuses brittle binaries. Authentic does not simply toss out “authenticity” wholesale: instead, she calls for its reclamation. For Burey, authenticity is not the unfiltered performance of personality that corporate culture often celebrates, but a more deliberate alignment between one’s values and one’s actions – an integrity that resists distortion by institutional demands. Rather than treating authenticity as a mandate to overshare or conform to sanitized ideals of openness, Burey urges readers to preserve the parts of it rooted in truth-telling, self-awareness and ethical clarity. In her view, the goal is not to abandon authenticity but to relocate it – to move it out of the boardroom’s performative rituals and into relationships and workplaces where trust, equity and accountability make genuine self-expression possible. Authenticity understood as a private, personal virtue is insufficient, she argues. Instead, authenticity must be collective, relational and structural. She advances the notion that we might reclaim agency – not by “performing identity better”, but by refusing complicity in the structures that exploit it.Authentic argues that marginalized employees are routinely required to demonstrate exceptional competence while contending with tokenization. They are expected to shoulder a disproportionate “cultural tax”, stepping in to provide mutual support where institutions fall short, and to lead diversity initiatives without genuine decision-making authority or sufficient resources. When these initiatives are dismantled or defunded, silence is often imposed on these employees. In practice, their contributions are dismissed, access to senior leadership remains obstructed, and their basic accommodation needs or visible markers of difference become recurring points of contestation.Burey grounds her claims in a diverse palette of voices, referencing thinkers such as bell hooks, Audre Lorde and Toni Morrison, and weaving cultural critique and scholarly insight.For example, Burey invokes Morrison to expose how institutions sustain inequity through endless dialogue rather than change. Quoting Morrison’s observation that racism functions as a “useful distraction” – forcing the marginalized to continually justify their existence – Burey situates the corporate workplace within that same dynamic.Equally diverse are the sources she consults, which she states in her author’s note are people of color who she intentionally chose not to identify by race, although it is “a common journalistic practice to name the race for people of color, teaching readers to understand ‘white’ as the default.” The decision to omit racial descriptors to interviewee names, as well as focusing on the experiences of those who are often punished for showing up authentic, is Burey’s small attempt to reclaim these voices from the margins.One of Burey’s victories is the clarity with which she reveals the inner workings of corporate illusion. She identifies the “authenticity playbook” that organizations deploy: expressive gestures (celebrating Juneteenth and honoring Martin Luther King Jr) layered over structural inaction (weak pay equity, racist performance reviews, stunted pathways for marginalized staff).The stakes she conveys are not abstract. Marginalized workers are increasingly paying with their health and their dignity in the workplace. Burey writes that disability both reveals and destabilizes the fiction of fixed identity – anyone can become disabled, suddenly or slowly, and yet workplaces remain built on the presumption of permanence and sameness. Even showing up – requesting accommodations, asserting boundaries or moving through space differently – becomes a form of resistance. Burey underscores that ableism, like all systems of exclusion, extracts not only from those it marginalizes but also from the collective humanity of the workplace itself. To reclaim authenticity is not merely to “feel safe”, but to demand environments in which difference is structurally legible – and unequal burdens are dissolved, not outsourced.Jodi-Ann Burey’s Authentic is not a comfort book. It is, rather, a reckoning: a mirror held to institutions that profit from the rhetoric of identity, and a hand extended to those who want to do work differently. It is at once personal and systemic, critical and hopeful. Though it may frustrate those seeking polished corporate manuals, it rewards readers willing to engage with discomfort, to interrogate the terms of belonging, and to imagine that a different culture of labor is possible.If you care about how identity, power and work intersect, if you wonder whether the workplace you inhabit wants your full self or just the parts it deems safe, this book demands your attention. The myth of authentic self at work may be deep, but Burey shows us how to begin excavating a more just ground beneath it.Explore more on these topicsBooksRaceLGBTQ+ rightsGenderfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Likewise,Seamus Heaneyintroduced Northern Irish vernacular into the English lyric, peppering his lines with words likeglarry, the Ulster word for muddy;kesh, from Irishceis, a wickerwork causeway; anddailigone, “daylight gone” or dusk, from Ulster-Scots. It is this that gives his writing a mulchy richness and cultural resonance that remain unique in contemporary poetry. One of the key poems in North (1975) is a version of Baudelaire’s The Digging Skeleton, to which Heaney brings an Irish flavour – the skeletons dig the earth “like navvies”. It’s especially rich as digging for Heaney is also a metaphor for writing, while the archaeological metaphor resonates with the darkly symbolic bog poems.Bringing all Heaney’s poems together in one volume, this collection lets us see for the first time all the archaeological layers that make up his oeuvre, from the talismanic Death of a Naturalist (1966) to the visionary long poem Station Island (1984), on to the parables of The Haw Lantern (1987) and the intimacies of The Human Chain (2010), the last volume published during the poet’s lifetime. A key poem in that collection, Chanson d’Aventure, describes his journey to hospital in an ambulance following a stroke: “Strapped on, wheeled out, forklifted, locked / In position for the drive”. The book also makes available at last Heaney’s prose poems, Stations (1975), released in a small press edition by Ulsterman Publications, which Heaney effectively kept under wraps as he felt the publication of Geoffrey Hill’s Mercian Hymns – “a work of complete authority” – had stolen his thunder in this form.The editors have taken the admirable decision to leave the published volumes intact, so that their careful ordering, something Heaney learned from Yeats, remains in place. Between each volume they insert all the contemporaneous poems that Heaney published in magazines and in pamphlets, as well as a selection of previously unpublished manuscript poems. There are a surprising number of these uncollected poems, and what surprises too is the richness of these previously undisclosed seams. In the earliest poems we see the influence of Ted Hughes and Gerard Manley Hopkins as Heaney gropes his way towards his distinctive personal style. There are important occasional poems such as An Open Letter, protesting about his inclusion in the 1982 Penguin Book of Contemporary BritishPoetry, and a smattering of villanelles that simmer deliciously without reaching the intensity of the collected verses. Elsewhere we see Heaney trying out different metaphors for the act of writing, such as casting a line, before he settles on the metaphor of digging in Death of a Naturalist. And there is the occasional radiant gem, such as Aran: “The rock breaks out like bone from a skinned elbow / And the island coughs itself into high cliffs / That drop straight down to goose-flesh waves on the winter sea.”What impresses is the consistency and the variety, coupled with the continuing ability to surprise us, for while Heaney always hugs the shore of tradition, he is not afraid to experiment, developing and deepening his craft. In an interview with Dennis O’Driscoll, discussing the attention he pays to the sounds of words in Wintering Out (1972), Heaney was dismissive when asked about the sound poets Kurt Schwitters and Bob Cobbing, pronouncing: “I have nothing at all to declare in that area.” Yet when I corresponded with Heaney in 2006 about experiments in French poetry, including the formal innovations of the Oulipo, he responded with enthusiasm. The French tradition of syllabic poetry, where syllable takes precedence over stress patterns, informs the slithering six-syllable lines of Beyond Sargasso, one of many poems about eels, in Door into the Dark (1969). Heaney’s love of a pun is pushed to the limit with chilling effect in Two Lorries, his only sestina, which reinvents the form by metamorphosing the end word “load” into “lode”, “lead”, “payload”, and finally “explode”. In Seeing Things (1991) Heaney creates a form of his own invention in the clarifying 12-liners of the sequence Squarings, a form he was to return to again and again, where he attains a new simplicity and transparency, almost stripped of rhetoric, as the skin is stripped from an eel: “Roof it again. Batten down. Dig in. / Drink out of tin. Know the scullery cold, / A latch, a door-bar, forged tongs and a grate.”Some of Heaney’s boldest work is to be found in his translations, and while these, including his prizewinningBeowulf, have mainly been published in a separate volume, we find the freer translations collected here, many of which come close to Alice Oswald’s idea of “trans-shifting”, as in his reworking of Dante in Station Island. Two poems in Human Chain riff on Virgil’s Aeneid VI, where Virgil visits the underworld. The Riverbank Field moves Virgil across time and place, replacing the Lethe with local river the Moyola:Ask me to translate what Loeb gives as“In a retired vale…a sequestered grove”And I’ll confound the Lethe in MoyolaBy coming through Back Park down from Grove HillAcross Long Rigs on to the riverbank –Which way, by happy chance, will take me pastThe domos placidas, “those peaceful homes”Of Upper Broagh. Moths then on evening waterIt would have to be, not bees in sunlight …In Route 110, we see Heaney bag a secondhand Virgil in Belfast’s Smithfield Market, before taking the bus, Cookstown via Toome and Magherafelt, and as we follow him, as in Joyce’s Ulysses, Virgil’s underworld and the shades of the Troubles are superimposed: “And what in the end was there left to bury / Of Mr Lavery, blown up in his own pub / As he bore the primed device and bears it still // Mid-morning towards the sun-admitting door / Of Ashley House?”This book is a landmark, and while some readers, including this one, may at first balk at 500 pages of notes, these have been compiled with loving expertise, leaving no stone unturned. Above all, the notes let us glimpse Heaney’s processes – “all those anglings, aimings, feints and squints”, as he puts it in Seeing Things, with reference to the game of marbles – how he tries out ideas in draft, sometimes abandoning them, and then returns to the same material later, before arriving at the final poem. The resulting volume lets us see Heaney’s work, whose ripples we are still learning to navigate, for the colossal achievement it is, and it reminds us that Heaney is not only a keeper but an enricher of the word-hoard.Philip Terry’s latest collection is Dante’s Purgatorio (Carcanet).

As Mike Kenny’s new play demonstrates, the experience was certainly sharp and shocking, but its impact on those detained was far from short.Bad Lads is created from a story by Jimmy Coffey and the testimonies of the Medomsley men held atthe youth detention centre, channelling the brutal ordeals of countless young men into a single fictitious character in the 1980s. After taking a joyride on a milk float, 17-year-old Jackie is sentenced to three months at Medomsley, where he is soon subject to horrifying cruelty at the hands of the staff, enduring a relentless pattern of violence, humiliation and sexual abuse.In Jenny Sealey’s production for Graeae, Jackie’s story is told by three actors: the character’s younger (Robin Paley Yorke) and older (Danny Raynor) selves, alongside a third Jackie (Craig Painting) who interprets in British Sign Language. As well as creatively integrating access, this choice strikingly suggests the splintering of the self in the aftermath of abuse and offers echoes of many other experiences like Jackie’s. It also allows the character to reflect forwards and backwards across time, embodying present fear and retrospective shame.View image in fullscreenStriking … Danny Raynor and Robin Paley Yorke.Photograph: Von Fox PromotionsIn this way we see the lasting repercussions of what these lads went through, as older Jackie looks back after more than three decades. Kenny and Sealey are careful with the representations of violence, doing just enough through language and movement to evoke these horrors without reproducing them. Simple, overlapping repetition captures the unremitting routine of abuse, while Painting’s expressive signing – a pulsing hand at the heart on the word “terror”, for example – adds a rich visual texture to the spoken descriptions. The effect is harrowing.This is unapologetically campaigning theatre, demanding justice and accountability. The show’s theatrical power may be slightly dented by the shift to editorialising, as the performers decry the authorities’ inadequate response, but the closing call to action is hard to ignore.AtLive theatre, Newcastle, until 11 October.

It’s a utopian – or dystopian – daydream of what sound can be. Could the speakers broadcast enough sonic power, enough soul and love, to blast away reality? They are silent, of course; the mystery, the dread, lies in the expectancy.Not any longer. House of Music, Peter Doig’s new exhibition, or club, or festival, turns this painting hanging in the Serpentine’s vestibule-like introductory space into a manifesto, and turns up the volume.Doig’s eerie paintings are set to a soundtrack of music selected from his personal collection of vinyl and played through immense speakers, salvaged from old cinemas by his collaborator Laurence Passera. These archaeological objects are sculptures in themselves, with gaping mouths of wood and metal that once boomed behind the screens of British picture houses and auditoriums in the golden age of cinema-going. One Western Electric/Bell Labs speaker system was made in the late 1920s and early 1930s, at the very advent of films with synchronised sound. Your body and head will be filled with Aretha Franklin, Kraftwerk,Black Truth Rhythm Band, Neil Young and the painter’s other favourites – if it works, that is.View image in fullscreenLion in the Road, 2015.Photograph: © Peter Doig. All Rights ReservedWhen I visited early, the speakers were silent; Passera climbing about in a chaos of wires and circuits, finalising the setup, as if preparing for some legendary music festival – the night before Woodstock, the day before Altamont. The eve of creation or destruction. Doig remained unflappable.At least I could concentrate on the paintings in peace. It may get rowdy when it opens. There will be dancing and sweat. Tables and chairs of hewn wood and recliners are scattered through the gallery’s variously lit rooms, adding to the invitation to enjoy this as a club. Yet it’s all a natural extension of the vibes you get from Doig’s art. The moment you enter you are cocooned in his misty musical dreams. An old musician plucks a guitar. Where are we? No place and every place, a fantastical realm of art. For all the affinity with pop culture, there’s something of the 1890s about Doig’s art. He channels the stilled landscapes of the French muralistPuvis de Chavannesand the Tahitian forests of Gauguin. There are naked women in the woods, or on rollerskates. They seem to me more spiritual than carnal. In one painting, a masked woman is apparently tied to a tree like Saint Sebastian as dark blue nudes move around her in a melting red and green forest. It’s the crazed dream you might have after worrying all day about the politics of “primitivism” in modern art.What is he saying? Who cares? Figurative details dissolve before your eyes in heady washes and drunken cascades of painterly texture, flowing over canvas, or linen, or sometimes vellum. At the start, a wall of flags greets you; but soft edges, blurred boundaries and hazy strokes turn these symbols into ghostly echoes. Above them are two tiny, tropical islands in a still blue sea, their dark silhouettes pulsing, shimmering, flickering.View image in fullscreenMaracas, 2002–08.Photograph: Peter DoigEvery solid object sinks into the ocean of colours. The painting that draws me back most is Music of the Future, a more than three-metre wide vision of a lakeside party venue at night. People and lights, clubhouses and umbrellas are scattered along the shore, its deeply shadowed water reflecting the night above. The creation of atmosphere through ultra-fine yet never prissy gradations of colour is utterly captivating: the night is not black but an infinitely various mix of green and purple, in paint that still seems wet even though this work was made in the early years of the 21st century.One work genuinely is practically wet – Doig was adding touches on Monday before art handlers arrived to tear it from his studio, he tells me. A lion stands in solitary fury in a yellow courtyard next to a jailhouse. Blood soaks its shaggy mane but it remains unbowed. Beyond columns with statues on top, across a brown wasteland under a red sky as hollow and disturbing as a Dalí desert, stand the ruins of a bombed city.Doig’s art seems to take you to an ethereal dream space, off the map and out of the history books, but the news from nowhere turns out to be full of urgency. This painting is one of three history-scale canvases starring the Lion of Judah that hang in the centre of the show, with the oldest speakers. In the first he painted, a spectral man stumbles past a yellow and green prison house while the lion stands in regal defiance. It inspired a poem by Nobel prizewinner Derek Walcott. Last year, Doig painted Lions (Ghost) – two lions half-playing, half-slumbering under a mossy arch before a pink, seaside scene (Collioure, where Matisse invented Fauvism).Just as I start to think it’s all got a clear moral message, Doig explains that it was inspired by a trip to Valletta, Malta to see Caravaggio’s Beheading of John the Baptist. Now I see that it reproduces the architecture of this unforgettable painting, and that there’s a tiny sketch of the executioner getting out his knife to cut the last bit of skin of John’s neck.It’s a cover version. Doig’s sonic enterprise teaches that the language of painting is not remote or difficult, but as enjoyable as music. Artists remix other artists, and in his case, can paint images that get into your head as enigmatically and irremovably as a song. I don’t think I’ll ever forget that lakeside nocturne or fathom it.

A fourthEnglish National Opera revival of Calixto Bieito’s now classic 1970s-set productionof one of the most bankable operas in the repertory. A cast of young British singers on the brink of stardom. A score that the chorus and orchestra could surely perform in their sleep, in the hands of a conductor who madean impressive UK debutat the Coliseum last year.This Carmen got off to a good start, too. In the pitClelia Cafieroplunged into Bizet’s overture at an exhilarating gallop, driving the orchestra as if she had hot-wired it. The details remained intact as the Toreador’s theme flashed past, the sound polished, brass gleaming proudly. After such near-reckless momentum, the heavy landing of the overture’s closing section – the strings scrubbing furiously as the opera’s dark side surfaced – was brutally effective orchestral drama.But there are no dead certs in live performance and that initial intensity of musical focus dwindled rapidly. A few beautifully shaped wind solos couldn’t make up for swathes of unblended strings, or passages in which the orchestra parted ways with the singers on stage. Even the ENO chorus sounded out of sorts, most effective as its members strained at a rope barrier across the front of the stage to watch the bullfight in Act Four, their combined vocal wattage and dramatic presence as a mass of individuals prioritised over subtlety of tone.View image in fullscreenUnusually small-voiced … Cory McGee (Escamillo) and Niamh O’Sullivan,Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianIn the title role, BBC New Generation artistNiamh O’Sullivanprovided industrial quantities of sass, her creamy, covered mezzo compelling as she set about seducing all and sundry. Yet she was audibly held back by the English translation, its text awkwardly bolted on to Bizet’s vocal lines. The ensembles with her smuggler gang – fast, natty music – tripped over English words and finicky melodic writing alike, despite appealing turns fromHarriet EyleyandSiân Griffithsas Carmen’s female sidekicks andPatrick Alexander Keefe’s powerful Dancaïre.Ava Doddwas an unusually tough, go-getting Micaela (her soprano generous if hard-edged),Cory McGeean unusually small-voiced Escamillo, most comfortable in his ultra-tender last encounter with Carmen.John Findon’s Don José was pitifully brutish, his huge tenor glossy at its best but strained elsewhere, periodically required to project from the back of the Coliseum’s vast stage.In Bieito’s now extraordinarily noisy staging, however, much of this musical detail is overwhelmed. No car door goes unslammed, no surface unkicked as men shout and women scream. Passions always run high in Carmen’s Spain, but this revival is all volume, no chemistry. If Don José – desperate in the opera’s final scene – asks Carmen whether she still loves him and the audience laughs when she says no, something has gone badly wrong.At theColiseum, London, until 5 NovemberExplore more on these topicsOperaEnglish National Opera (ENO)Georges BizetClassical musicreviewsShareReuse this content"

Gliding into the auditorium with the house lights up, he appears as Tom Wingfield, the narrator of Tennessee Williams’s sad, autobiographical play. He meets us on our own ground and points out the artifice: behind the curtain a memory play of uncertain authority. In a striking opening, the actor is cool and reflective.In Andrew Panton’s production, he is also defeated. Acted out on Emily James’s barest suggestion of a set – a spiral staircase, a breezy window frame, a hint of gloomy wallpaper lit in moody blues by Simon Wilkinson – it is a depressive reading of the play that the director conjures up. It is also restrained and stately.All the fight has been knocked out of Tom, an aspiring writer scratching a living in a warehouse by day, escaping into drink and movies by night. Yes he is frustrated, but his anger is tempered.Likewise, his mother, Amanda, is played by Sara Stewart not as a neurotic southern belle with unreasonable expectations of her children but as a disappointed woman calmly wishing the best for them. Only when she makes a grand entrance in a daffodil-yellow frock, throwing off clouds of ancient dust, does she hint at the cloying monster Tom would have her be. Mostly, she is just let down.View image in fullscreenLevel-headed … Amy Conachan as Laura, with Christopher Jordan-Marshall as Tom.Photograph: Tommy Ga-Ken WanIt is an approach that gains in quiet domestic realism what it loses in unhinged vitriol. As a result, the muted production comes into its own in the tremendous extended scene between sister Laura and her gentleman caller, Jim O’Connor.Amy Conachan plays Laura as level-headed rather than shy: she is under no illusions about her disability. That makes her look of delight all the more moving when Declan Spaine’s Jim signs an old theatre programme for her – and her look of dejection all the more crushing when her ideal man says he wishes she were his sister.AtDundee Repuntil 18 October.

Is Live Nation holding it back?Artists including Coldplay and Katy Perry have got behind a plan to fund small venues from big gigs – but owners say that without Live Nation on board, it could failDan McCarthyThu 9 Oct 2025 03.00 EDTShareGrassroots venues are the bedrock of the country’s music industry, giving artists a place to hone their craft, and punters a place to see them perform up-close – possibly before a bigger, starrier career. But since the start of 2023, more than150 of these venueshave permanently closed their doors – about 16% of the entire UK sector.In this moment of crisis, a solution is on the table: a proposed £1 levy on tickets for all arena and stadium shows with more than 5,000 capacity could raise up to £25m annually for the grassroots venues facing closure. A poll ofabout 8,000 music fansfound that 93% supported the initiative by the charity Music Venue Trust, and a spokesperson from the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) says it “fully supports” the rollout.Over the last year, major artists such as Coldplay, Ed Sheeran, Pulp, Diana Ross, Katy Perry and Radiohead have all committed to it, alongside venues such as the Royal Albert Hall and ticketing platform Tixel. Sam Fender’s 2024 arena tour raised more than £100,000 via the levy, which has recently been distributed to 38 independent venues. “The idea that money from shows in big venues supports the smaller venues, where it all starts for musicians like me, is just common sense,” Fender has said.But a huge funding gap remains. For concerts in 2025, more than 22m of 24.2m eligible tickets are sold without the £1 contribution, according to industry data shared withthe Guardian. And while the early picture for 2026 shows positive momentum, with uptake rising to 28%, this still translates to millions in missing potential support. “The industry is very good at adding fees where the company adding the fee is the beneficiary, and not quite so efficient when the money is for the wider ecosystem,” says Mark Davyd, chief executive of Music Venue Trust.View image in fullscreen‘The idea that money from shows in big venues supports the smaller venues is just common sense’ … Sam Fender.Photograph: Emma McIntyre/Getty Images for CoachellaSteve Dix of Hackney venue Paper Dress Vintage backs the levy as an important step in stabilising grassroots venues across the country, and is blunt about what he thinks is its main obstacle. “Some of the big players such as AEG Presents, SJM and Kilimanjaro Live have already stepped up and shown real leadership,” he says, referring to three of the big promoters that arrange arena and stadium gigs. “But the truth is that until the biggest [promoter] in the world, Live Nation, does the same, progress will be held back. Their participation is the missing piece that would turn this from a promising initiative into an industry standard.”According to data presented to the government’s Business and Trade Committee by the Association of Independent Festivals (AIF), Live Nation controls 66% of the UK’s major event ticket market in 2025, either directly or through its subsidiary companies such as Ticketmaster. Back in May, former minister for creative industries, Sir Chris Bryant,called on Live Nationto “step up” regarding levy adoption, and “help in relation to Ticketmaster and … any of the acts they are representing”. Bryant also called on more artists to sign up to the levy, and suggested that the government would act “if this weren’t to be proceeding”, enshrining the £1 levy in law.But Davyd claims a statutory government levy would be a “blunt instrument”, taking years to legislate, with the risk of funds being misdirected. In contrast, he argues the voluntary model “can be delivered very fast, and can be very effectively distributed.” A spokesperson for Salford experimental venue The White Hotel agrees: “As soon as the government gets involved in anything you know they’re just going to make a pig’s ear of it.” (DCMS did not comment on this criticism.)The money is already making a difference on the ground. Fender’s donation, for example, has been distributed via theLiveline Fund– a Music Venue Trust and Save Our Scene initiative – allowing venues such as Paper Dress Vintage to replace a broken mixing desk, Glasgow’s Sub Club to repair their iconic “bodysonic” dancefloor, and providing The White Hotel with “vital” financial support. This fund is a precursor to theLive Trust, a charity established by the wider industry in January 2025 to be the official administrator for the £1 levy, set to begin distributing funds in February 2026.View image in fullscreenDiana Ross, one of the artists who has contributed to the fund for grassroots venues.Photograph: Jim Dyson/Getty ImagesWhen asked whether it would indeed “step up” and add the £1 levy to all of the major concerts it promotes, Live Nation did not directly respond, but affirmed that “supporting new talent is vital to the future of music” and that it was “proud to champion emerging artists and grassroots venues … We support the aims of the grassroots ticket levy, and it’s encouraging to see artists we promote already opting in for their shows.”The £1 levy has its critics. Some argue that the cost should not be passed on to fans, who already face escalating ticket prices. “There has been something of a mixed response,” says Mike Grieve, Sub Club’s managing director, noting a feeling that “major concert promoters are already asking their customers to dig deep to pay for tickets”.However, he says the additional funding is a “massive help” for smaller operators, particularly as razor-thin margins are hampering their ability to book lesser-known or experimental acts. “It has become unsustainable for promoters to take any creative risk,” he adds.Davyd suggests that when a promoter links with a ticketing company to sell tickets, the ticketing company should be asking whether the absence of the £1 levy was a deliberate choice or an accidental omission. But without Live Nation taking the lead, “it’s difficult to see how a statutory levy is avoided”, Davyd claims. “If the market leader in an industry refuses to do what is now government policy, we should expect the government to take different action.”Explore more on these topicsMusicMusic industryPop and rockfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Pountney, having never seen Judge’s work, but liking the way he talked about it, invited him to direct Gounod’s Faust for the company in 1985. Ten years later, for the same company, he directed Lesley Garrett in La Belle Vivette, Michael Frayn’s rewrite of Offenbach’s La Belle Hélène, best described, perhaps, as a collectors’ item.Plácido Domingo took a shine to Judge when he directed him in the 1857 version of Verdi’s Simon Boccanegra at Covent Garden in 1997 and, over the next 25 years – in concert with the costume designer Deirdre Clancy and the scenic designerJohn Gunter, alumni of the 1970s Royal Court – he directed mainstream opera in New York and Los Angeles, St Petersburg, Amsterdam and Madrid.View image in fullscreenJudge’s breakthrough happened after a chance encounter at a dinner partyJudge was shamelessly “devoted to glamour”, he said, but worked ferociously hard, not least with the actors and singers he loved deeply, and was happy to be accused of not liking them because he insisted on being “tough”. Although he mellowed in later years, not realising how ferocious he was known to be in rehearsals, he took a perverse pride in being dubbed “the poison dwarf”. Judge was indeed small and cuddly in stature, and would recall that his early years as an actor were spent playing “funny people in sitcoms and furry animals”.Aged six, he had gone backstage at a local Peter Pan and fell in love with the technical workings, the sound and the lighting. His doting parents – he was an adopted, only child – gave him a Pollock’s toy theatre and converted his bedroom into a theatre, complete with red plush seats (from a defunct proper theatre), curtains and a spotlight. In adulthood, he was the enemy of what became known as directors’ theatre. Conceptual theatre of any kind was, to him, anathema. He loved Victorian theatre magic, trap doors, tricks and high spirits.This practical disposition was triumphantly indulged in a brilliant, surreal-into-pop production of Shakespeare’s Comedy of Errors for the RSC in 1995, when the farcical mix-up involving two pairs of twins, the Antipholuses and their respective servants, the Dromios, were played by just two fine actors (Desmond Barrit and Graham Turner). The difficulty of presenting the final scene with all the characters on the stage at once was blithely overcome by using “doubles” and absorbed in the sheer buoyancy of the show. It was the best RSC revival of the play since the long-running improvisationalClifford Williamsproduction of 1962 which, said Kenneth Tynan, defined the birth of a great new company underPeter Hall.View image in fullscreenJoseph Fiennes in Troilus and Cressida, 1996.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianJudge was born in Southport, Lancashire, and was adopted in infancy by Marjorie and Jack Judge, who ran a confectioners’ shop – Jack also worked as a swimming instructor. Ian was educated at King George V grammar school, leaving aged 14 to work in a rates office, take part in amateur theatre and design window displays for a local department store. Five years later, in 1969, he won a place at the Guildhall School of Music & Drama, London, where he trained as an actor. Graduating in 1971, he worked around the fringe and regions until offered an assistant director’s post byTerry Handsat the RSC in 1975. He stayed for five years. He subsequently learned about directing in whatever work came his way, including drama school shows, before he met Pountney.His success at ENO triggered a return to the RSC in 1987, where he directed Imelda Staunton and Jim Carter in an extravagant art deco Wizard of Oz, closely based on the 1939 MGM movie.One of Judge’s drama school productions, and the most significant, was the UK premiere in 1983 of George Furth and Stephen Sondheim’s Merrily We Roll Along – a Broadway flop in 1981, now recognised as an ingenious, poignant masterpiece of interlocking friendship and careers viewed in retrospect – at the Guildhall. Judge’s production was pitch perfect when it transferred to the Bloomsbury theatre, where it positively gleamed with imaginative zestiness, even more impressive and moving for being performed by students at the start of their own careers.He went on to direct hugely enjoyable revivals of the Gershwins’ Oh! Kay, with a light-headed book by Guy Bolton and PG Wodehouse, at Chichester in 1984; as well as Sondheim’s A Little Night Music (book by Hugh Wheeler) starringLila KedrovaandDorothy Tutinat the Piccadilly theatre and Show Boat by Jerome Kern and Oscar Hammerstein for Opera North, both terrific, in 1990.View image in fullscreenEmma Fielding (Viola) and Clive Wood (Count Orsino) in the RSC production of Twelfth Night at the Barbican, 1995.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianOther acclaimed productions forOpera Northin the 1980s included Verdi’s Macbeth and Attila (John Tomlinson in the latter), Puccini’s Tosca, and Mussorgsky’s Boris Godunov – not exactly light-headed musical theatre, followed by Verdi’s Falstaff and Bellini’s Norma for Scottish Opera in the early 90s.Judge acquired an unjustly condescending reputation for cosy comedy productions of Shakespeare at the RSC, perhaps due to his delightful, audience friendly 1994 versions of Love’s Labour’s Lost and Twelfth Night, the latter complete with a Gunter warm glow stage facsimile of Stratford-upon-Avon itself. Anyone who didn’t find these shows knock-out treats (as I did) could relax into harshness with a superb 1995 well-judged revival of Troilus and Cressida – designed by Gunter and Clancy – with Joseph Fiennes and a new star, Victoria Hamilton, in the leads, an army of bare-buttocked soldiers and a lip-smacking relish for this truly great play’s exposé of a world of wars and lechery, lies and deceit.View image in fullscreenMassenet’s Don Quixote at the London Coliseum for ENO, 1994.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianHis last London theatre production was a well-reviewed Gilbert and Sullivan,The Mikado, at the Savoy in 2000. “It’s a slick evening, with an emphasis on colour and wit: a fizzy tonic with a dash of bitters, and D’Oyly Carte back in its rightful place,” Robert Thicknesse wrote in the Times. Most of his subsequent work until 2009 was in opera, and mostly abroad.Judge suffered from ill health in recent years, and was cared for by a longstanding and loyal friend.Ian Judge, theatre and opera director, born 21 July 1946; died 15 September 2025Explore more on these topicsTheatreOperaRoyal Shakespeare CompanyOpera NorthMusicalsWilliam ShakespeareGilbert and SullivanobituariesShareReuse this content"

His body now bears the damage of that era. But he still wants more. He discusses love, passion, pride and performing for Donald TrumpPaula CocozzaThu 9 Oct 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 9 Oct 2025 05.47 EDTShareMichael Flatley’s feet used to move so fast, they tapped 35 times a second and required a £25m insurance policy on his legs. He hasn’t danced for nearly 10 years – not even in his own quiet way any more, he says – but the “feet of flames” that bewitched 60 million over more than four decades must now be in one hell of a state.We are sitting at a table in the emptied breakfast room of the InterContinental hotel in Dublin when Flatley whips his right foot out on to the seat beside me: size eight, small and sockless in unflashy black sneakers. If my feet had put me on the Sunday Times Rich List, I say, I’d dress them in silk socks and stroke them each night to thank them. “Well, listen,” he says. “I don’t really give any of that any thought. To be honest, I don’t think much about me.”Self-effacement is not what Michael Flatley is known for; at least, it’s not what the swagger of his stage persona suggests. Truth is, he says, “I don’t even look at myself. I don’t give that 10 seconds of my time … I get up to the mirror, brush my teeth, say ‘Oh dear’ – and gone.”It was in 1994 that Flatley leapt into the public eye in Riverdance, a seven-minute extravaganza during the interval of the Eurovision song contest, in Dublin. He kicked and clicked his feet to throbbing drums, satin shirt billowing over his bronze chest, arms flung wide. Even his bouffant hair seemed to rewrite all the rules of Irish dancing. Each show he created afterwards – from Lord of theDanceand Feet of Flames to Celtic Tiger – delivered more taps for your bucks. And at 67, Flatley still seems to hear the drumbeat, always thinking, “What’s next?” he says, looking around the breakfast room. “What’s next?”He says he’s let his “gloves down a bit”, but he looks dapper in a navy jacket, silken collar upstanding, and “a bit of warpaint” that his wife, Niamh, has put on him. (She was in the chorus line of that first Riverdance, and was subsequently his leading lady.) We meet the day after Flatley launches the 30th anniversary tour of Lord of the Dance. The news is full of the Irish presidential election campaign, in which he’d hoped to run as an independent candidate.The unnamed “heavyweights” who approached him feltIrelandneeded a new energy. “I was trying to envisage what the presidency would look like with me leading the charge,” he says. His fingers drum the tablecloth. “Meeting world leaders, bringing business and art back to Ireland.”He decided against standing after a heart-to-heart with his 18-year-old son. Flatley was diagnosed with an “aggressive cancer” in 2023, and he’s still being treated, “monitoring really”, and couldn’t get the prerequisite clean bill of health. In any case, he says, “You need to get permission as the president just to leave the country. You need to get permission to meet world leaders … That’s restrictive for me.”He probably has world leaders on speed dial. “I’ve got a few of them,” he says. “I’ve met Tony Blair and Obama, and the Clintons gave me awards. Putin, Berlusconi, Mandela.” He doesn’t flinch at putting those last names together. His respect for authority transcends politics. He performed at Donald Trump’s inaugural ball.“Please don’t make a big deal of this,” he says. “I was born in America. I grew up a boxer, swinging sledgehammers on construction sites. If the president of your country asks you to perform, it takes a better man than me to say no,whoeverthat person is. ‘It’s my honour,sir. Yes,sir’,” he says.“America gave my parents their dream – a job,” he says. He’s tapping the table again. It seems to be a reflex when he’s talking about energy, work, dreams, as if he’s keeping time with a beat only he can hear.“It’s like I have a Ferrari Formula One car racing around in my mind and it won’t stop,” he says. “I can’t turn it off.” It comes from being “fanatically driven”. His mind is always on the go. Keeps him up at night. He’s only had five hours’ sleep. First thing in the morning, he sinks two double espressos, goes for a swim, then a power walk. Although he speaks slowly, he sounds deliberate, as if he’s overruling some insistent internal rhythm.View image in fullscreen‘They took away the show I created, and I was on my own, my back against the wall.’Photograph: Johnny Savage/The GuardianThe problem is, “There’s always another dream waiting to happen,” he says. Last year he launched Flatley whiskey. He paints, using his feet and hands (his one exhibition sold out for a seven-figure sum). At the anniversary launch, somebody told him, “‘Well, you’ve done it all!’ I said, ‘Nonsense! I’m only just getting warmed up.’”What more does he want to achieve?“I don’t know,” he says. “Everything.”But he can’t haveeverything.“Why not?” he says.Well, what does “everything” even mean?View image in fullscreen‘My wife takes first place’ … Flatley with Niamh.Photograph: Ben Montgomery/Getty Images“I don’t know. I don’t know what that means,” he says quickly. “Whatever it is, I’m in search of it … I want to do everything I can within my power while I’m still alive to leave a mark,” he says. “We’re so insignificant. We’re gone in the blink of an eye. How many of us will be remembered? Mandela, Ali,” he says.Flatley? “Thank you for saying that,” he says – he’s scrupulously polite – “but it’s not necessarily true.”Back when Flatley lived in London’s Little Venice, he walked past a graveyard every morning, after his double espressos, without much thought. “One day, I took a shortcut through it. And I said, ‘My God, you never took the time. Look at all these people. They’ve given their whole lives already.’”“Having said that,” he says, “I’m going to give it hell to do the best that I can while I’m here … God bless me, I’m in the joy business. I’m in the joy business.” He throws his arms out wide. “I can look back on that deathbed and say, ‘You fuckin’ went for it.’ I’m sorry for my language, Paula,” he says. “Forgive me. I absolutely went for it. That’s just the truth.”Although Flatley considers himself “100% Irish”, he grew up in Chicago. His parents emigrated to the US in 1947 to find work. His mother looked after the five children and helped his father build their construction business.Flatley, who danced 300 shows in 1997 alone, credits his parents for his work ethic. The sledgehammer and cold winters crop up whenever he talks about his background. There was always more to do. On non-school days, his father would bang on the door. “‘Let’s get in the truck,Let’s move, let’s move, LET’S MOVE!’”Even after he made it, his mother wanted more: “Mikey, give up that old dancing lark now and go off and make a few movies.”View image in fullscreenMichael Flatley at Digges Lane dance studio, Dublin, during rehearsals for Riverdance.Photograph: Marc O’Sullivan/ShutterstockYoung Flatley boxed. He only started dancing at 11, practising alone in the garage to catch up with his peers. Sometimes, he danced for 16 hours a day, just him and a broken mirror, hammering his feet on the concrete floor. He dreamed of becoming world champion. The extended family included a discus and hammer champion, a dancing champion and a champion boxer.“Breeding beats feeding,” Flatley’s father used to say.The trophies rolled in. “Seven all-American titles, five all-Canadian titles … but I couldn’t get a look-in in Ireland,” Flatley says. The form was strict. “It was very …” He stops. “I don’t want to use a word that might sound offensive.”Prudish? I’m thinking of the open shirt and David Hasselhoff hair. “I can’t say those things!” he says, sounding utterly affronted. “Restricted. Restrained.”To win the world championship at 17, he had to un-Flatley himself. He wore a kilt, kept his “arms tight, no flamboyant gesticulations …” But, he says sadly, “I felt like only half of me was present on stage.”Over the next 18 years, he developed the full Flatley. Irish folk band the Chieftains invited him on tour with them. “And the more I incorporated my body and facial expression and energy and emotion, the more the audience reacted.” One night, he couldn’t find his costume. “Like a lot of bachelors, there’s shirts and other things under the bed. Where’s that tuxedo?” he says, looking under the tablecloth. He went on stage bare-chested. The audience loved that too.All the while, he worked with his dad. He’d return from performing “on a one-way standby Allegheny airline ticket and straight into the truck … swinging that bloody fecking sledgehammer at 6am in the freezing cold Chicago winters.”No matter, he says, because “I got my chance to be the star of the show ... And that was enough to keep the fire burning.”View image in fullscreenMichael Flatley and Jean Butler in the  Riverdance interval act at Eurovision in 1994.Flatley was 35 when he got the call to perform Riverdance – an age when many dancers consider retirement. He must have thought he’d finally made it, but eight months after the full show opened in 1995, he was sacked. He wanted creative control. “You wouldn’t say to a great painter, ‘Paint that painting, but you know what? Don’t use any red,’” he says. The music was composed by Bill Whelan, and the stage show produced by Moya Doherty and John McColgan, but Riverdance has always been synonymous with Flatley.“They took away the show I created, and I was on my own, my back against the wall with the tears running,” he says. He’s “terribly sensitive”. He can pick out the one seated person in a standing ovation. (“What did I do wrong? Why didn’t I get through to the one?”) And after Riverdance, just like in the garage with the cracked mirror, “it was me with me again.”Within less than a year, he’d opened Lord of the Dance. “It was abuzz. Like a drug.” There he was, between the audience and his dancers, like having the Roman legion behind him, he says, or the sound of Concorde. “Dadada dada dadada… You could feel the dancers’ energy. ‘I’m here, look at me.’ And every inch of energy they put out, they’d get back tenfold from the audience. You’re exchanging energy.”Essentially, he made Irish dancing sexy.“I don’t know if that’s true, but thank you for saying it,” he says.Certainly his autobiography abounds with stories of burning the candle at both ends, partying in hotel rooms and .... “No, no,” he interrupts. “I have a wife and son now and it wouldn’t be fair on them. And it wouldn’t be fair on me.”View image in fullscreenFlatley in Lord of the Dance at the London Coliseum, 1996.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianHe and Niamh have been married for 19 years, in which time, he says, “I cannot remember us having bad words … Of all the things I’ve got out of my dance career, my wife takes first place.”What he can say is that powerful men have a strong sex drive. “And that doesn’t mean a dirty thing. They’re driven, and I think the really great ones transmute that into their vision of success … or into my dance shows.”The intensity and speed of his performance has taken a huge toll on Flatley’s body. He used to eat three steaks a day and had 7% body fat. Now he knows all his painful vertebrae by name. “My C1, my C3, my T3, my L5, my sacroiliacs …” He has torn muscles, damaged bones, ruptured tendons, shoulders that need replacing, and “a fractured rib that sometimes when I’m talking still pains me”.In his prime, Lloyds of London, who insured his legs, told him, “Flatley, it’s like you’re fighting a 15-round fight every night.”They installed iced water beside the stage. “After the encore, I’d put my head into the ice to bring down the temperature in my brain,” he says. In his dressing room, he had “The Beast”: a barrel of iced water. “I would get in and sit there as long as I could, to bring the swelling down in my muscles.”Maybe this is why he loves swimming in the sea, or the Blackwater river in County Cork. “As soon as I put my head under, everything seems right again. It balances me. It’s very placatory.” The sound of the Ferrari in his head must be lost underwater.View image in fullscreenRehearsing for Lord of the Dance.Photograph: Ben Curtis/PAPlaying the flute is also “placating” (even in the InterContinental). And he loves reading.Castlehyde, his Irish estate – which he and Niamh can’t live in because it’s currently the subject of a lengthy legal dispute over repairs – has a library. “When you close the jib door, it looks like another shelf … And I’d sit in the corner and say” – he leans forward, rubbing his hands – “‘Where’ll we go today, lads? Who do we want to meet?” It was “so silent”, he says.“When things were manic in my life, that was my wonderful escape from me.From me.”Dostoevsky, Tolstoy, Joyce…“Forgive me now, if I get this wrong,” he says. “And er …And when he kissed me under the Moorish wall,” and he’s off, reciting a full paragraph from the end of Ulysses, Joyce’s stream-of-consciousness classic. “And yes I said yes I will Yes.“My God, he was a genius.” And he sits back, suddenly quiet. You can almost hear the quiet ticking and clicking of the engine at rest.Maybe Flatley wasn’t so much lord of the dance, as dance was the lord of him.“I needed to be on stage,” he says. “Before each show, I’d go into myself, and make a deal with myself. Flying across the front in my opening solo, anything can go wrong. You have to be lightning fast in your mind to deal with that. But I like being out there on the limb. Go past that, and you’re in chaos. And my deal with myself every night was: it won’t be a success until you reach chaos. Until you gotoo far.”It is a lot to ask of anyone. “I never explained that to anybody,” he says. “But that’s what kept the razor sharp. It was me with me.”Explore more on these topicsMichael FlatleyIrelandDancefeaturesShareReuse this content"

You decideFind out how to get a disagreement settled or become a jurorInterviews byGeorgina LawtonThu 9 Oct 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 9 Oct 2025 10.46 EDTShareThe prosecution: AnitaThe basket is huge, ugly andit stinks. Dirty clothes cango straight into the washing machineMy partner, Jayden, and I have just moved in together. He is a big fan of this wicker basket that he’s shipped from his old flat, but I want it gone.It’s not small or discreet, it’s massive and ugly, and takes up a whole corner of our bedroom. It’s this big, clunky thing that sits there full of smelly clothes. I honestly don’t see the point of it. Why shove dirty laundry in a basket for a week when you can put everything straight into the washing machine? At least if it’s in the washer, it’s where it belongs and ready to go.The basket just delays the inevitable. It’s like having an unnecessary middleman. And it doesn’t match the flat, and dominates the room like a dead piece of furniture. I don’t want to spend money and time making the place look nice just to have this smelly thing lurking in the corner.Clothes sitting in a basket for a week – socks, gym gear, sweaty T-shirt – makes the whole room stinkIt’s also unhygienic. Wicker is impossible to clean. If it gets damp, it smells even worse. Jayden says a laundry basket is “practical”. But I think it’s more practical to wash clothes straight away. I get that this isn’t always possible, and if I can’t get clothes straight into the wash, I’ll shove them to the bottom of the wardrobe.I know that’s not great, but it is very rare. If I had my way, dirty clothes would be washed the same day. They would go straight in the machine, job done. No festering. When Jayden sees my dirty clothes at the bottom of the wardrobe, he adds them to the laundry basket. That drives me mad, because I can’t find anything in the basket, it’s so big. He likes to do a big mixed laundry load every 10 days or so, whereas I prefer to wash more regularly. If we got rid of the basket, this would make it easier, as there wouldn’t be anywhere for clothes to pile up.The other thing is smell. Clothes sitting in a basket for a week – socks, gym gear, sweaty T-shirts – make the whole room stink. Jayden goes to the gym at least three times a week. At least in the washer, the smells are contained. But the basket smells. So I don’t want his cumbersome old basket in our new flat. New flat, new start.The defence: JaydenPutting dirty laundry in the wardrobe or straight into the machine makes everything mustyAnita says laundry baskets are pointless, but her argument doesn’t stand up. She talks about putting dirty clothes “straight into the wash” but she doesn’t do that often. Half the time her clothes lie balled up in the wardrobe for days.Thatis unhygienic, and also makes our clean clothes smell. She says she doesn’t want bad smells in the flat, but leaving clothes hidden in the wardrobe makes it worse.At least once a month I’ll find some old pants or socks at the bottom of our wardrobe. It’s annoying. I will put them in the laundry basket and then she’ll get annoyed at me, saying she can’t find her stuff. But at least a basket neatly contains clothes all in one place.Anita says it’s best to put everything in the washing machine, but it’s an appliance. If you’re throwing in damp clothes, or leaving stuff in there for days, that’s way worse than putting laundry in a basket. The washer will start to smell and the clothes will go musty, which is hard to get rid of.If smell is the issue,that’s just a matter of doing laundry more regularly, which I can do if it appeases AnitaThe basket keeps things together until there’s enough for a full load. If the smell is the issue, that’s not caused by the basket itself – it’s just a matter of doing laundry more regularly, which I can do if it appeases Anita.A laundry basket is practical and it saves time, energy and money. No one does laundry every single day, so where are the clothes supposed to go in the meantime? The laundry basket serves an important function.As for it being ugly? That’s subjective. I like my basket. It’s from my single days in my old flat. We’ve been through thick and thin. I’ve had it for years and it is sturdy, natural and has lasted well. Why should I throw away something that still works?This is also a matter of control. Our new flat is jointly ours: I don’t think I should have to remove an item that I like just because Anita doesn’t want it. Plus I think it looks fine. A flat is not a showroom, it’s meant to function and the basket functions well. So no, I don’t want to throw it out.The jury of Guardian readersThere’s no need to bicker over wicker – there is nothing unhygienic about a laundry basket. Just because clothes have been worn for a day or two doesn’t make them in any way harmful or even smelly.Marcel, 47skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

That’s bad for the environment and your energy bills. Wait till you have a full load. Having said that, no one wants sweaty gym clothes in the bedroom, so why not settle on non-smelly clothes in the washing basket and the machine runs every few days after gym visits.Fran, 25Jayden is innocent. Dirty laundry shouldn’t be mingling with clean clothes in a wardrobe – that’s what laundry baskets are for. The two of them just need to compromise and find a smaller basket that Anita likes.Jessie, 48I’d never thought of this before, but Anita’s idea is genius: throw dirty clothes straight into the washing machine to eliminate smells, save on space and get rid of an ugly piece of furniture all in one go. The only drawback I can think of is: how do you separate your coloureds and whites if all your dirty laundry lives in the washing machine?Gladstone, 61​Anita’s arguments just don’t hold water. They need a basket to put dirty clothes in before they have enough to do a full wash. Hiding dirty knickers in the wardrobe is weird, and putting the machine on for just one or two things is totally ungreen.Vicky, 42Now you be the judgeIn our online poll, tell us whose argument doesn’t washThe poll closes on Wednesday 15 October at 9am BSTLast week’s resultsWe asked whetherGene was wrong to want special salt and pepper shakers17%of you said yes –Gene is guilty83%of you said no –Gene is not guiltyJoin Guardian journalists atYou be the judge - live!As part of a specialGuardian Live eventon Wednesday 26 November, Georgina Lawton will be hosting an IRL version of this column.

Emma’scustomer feedbackhas too often boiled down to “nice mattress, shame about the customer service”. We couldn’t, in all conscience, recommend a product whose buyers complained of disappearing deliveries and absent aftercare. However, Emma’s Hybrid Premium has been a glaring omission from the Filter, and I was intrigued to find out why this mattress seemed so popular.To avoid any preferential treatment, I bought the Hybrid Premium rather than requesting a review sample. The mattress proved too soft for me and my family, so I decided to return it under Emma’s free 200-night trial. Here’s the good, the bad and the DPD (courier) of what happened next.View at EmmaHow I testedView image in fullscreenTaking it to the edge: the reviewer’s husband tests the Hybrid Premium’s support.Photograph: Jane Hoskyn/The GuardianMy undercover Emma adventure began when I ordered a double-size Hybrid Premium online at the beginning of September. I used my husband Alan’s email address, bank card and name. We have different surnames, so I’m confident I received the same treatment as any other Emma customer, both when buying the mattress and when trying to return it.As soon as the mattress was delivered, I removed it from its packaging and left it for a few days to expand to full size. Alan and I then took photos of it and ran our usualmattress testing experiments, using weights and wobbly cups of water to measure factors such as sinkage, motion isolation and edge support. Our family testing panel came over to score it out of 10 on firmness, breathability and comfort.Then came the sleeping. Alan and I shared the mattress for a week in mid-September, when night temperatures ranged from a comfortable 13C to a brisk-feeling 7C. Underneath was a slatted Ikea bed base; on top was a mattress protector, fitted sheet and medium 10.5-tog duvet. The Hybrid Premium does not claim to be a cooling mattress, but the changeable September nights gave us a chance to see how it fared on warm and chilly nights.What you need to know, from price to firmnessView image in fullscreen‘Emma doesn’t say how many springs are in the Hybrid Premium, so I counted them. The double has 672.’Photograph: Jane Hoskyn/The GuardianView at EmmaEmma’s mattress may have Premium in its name, but it’s cheaper than most of the hybrid mattresses I’ve reviewed. At £528 for a double (£587 for a king-size), the Emma costs about 20% less than theOtty Original Hybridand less than half the price of theSimba Hybrid Pro. It comes in seven sizes, ranging from UK single (£359) to UK super king (£679).The Hybrid Premium – formerly known as the NextGen Premium – is one of four mattresses made by Emma. The cheapest and most simple in terms of construction is the Hybrid Original, which starts at £249; the Hybrid Premium is next up the scale. Above it are the Hybrid Thermosync, which has more foam layers and starts at £519, and the Hybrid Airgrid, a softer mattress with even more foam and a starting price of £669.As with all hybrid mattresses, the Hybrid Premium combines springs (mainly for support) with multiple layers of foam (mainly for cushioning). It doesn’t contain as many springs or layers as more expensive hybrids, though. Emma doesn’t say how many springs are in the Hybrid Premium, so I counted them. The double has 672 pocket springs, each 18cm tall, which I found easy to count because they’re visible through the non-slip fabric base layer.Three layers of foam are stuck together to form a cushion between the springs and the removable fabric sleeping surface. The two lower foam layers each measure 1cm thick, and the one on top is 1.25cm. This top layer just about meets the description “memory foam”. It’s much less elastic than the foam in theTempur Pro Plus SmartCoolandPanda Hybrid Bamboo, and didn’t retain the shape of my hand when I pressed it, but it’s spongy enough to offset the bounce of the springs and help you sleep in peace if you share your bed.View image in fullscreenThe cover is easy to unzip and machine-wash.Photograph: Jane Hoskyn/The GuardianYou can unzip and machine-wash the Hybrid Premium’s entire cover. The non-slip bottom layer washes at 40C, while the soft top layer will endure 60C. The covers unzip quickly and smoothly, and I found them easy to wash and quick to dry.I also found the Hybrid Premium much easier to handle than most of the hybrid and foam mattresses I’ve reviewed. At 25cm deep, it perfectly fits standard fitted sheets, and at 29.5kg for a double, it’s one of the lighter mattresses I’ve tested. Good thing, too, because you should rotate the mattress from head to toe once a month for the first six months, then once every three months to avoid indentations where you sleep.The Hybrid Premium is described by Emma as medium-firm, but so are many mattresses, including those I’ve found to be firm (such as theOrigin Hybrid Pro) and soft (such as theEve Wunderflip Hybrid). When I asked my family to help rate its firmness, the consensus was that it falls at the softer end of medium-firm. I ran tests with weights to make sure, and the sleeping surface sank a maximum of 37mm under 7.5kg – not quite as soft as the Eve (which sank 40mm), but much softer than the Otty (25mm).The German company Emma Sleep has twophysical storesin the UK, in London and Manchester, so you can try a Hybrid Premium before buying, if either of those is close to you. Yet it can take weeks or even months to know whether a mattress is right for you, so I welcome Emma’s decision to extend its free trial from 100 nights to 200, in line with Simba and Origin.SpecificationsType:hybridFirmness:advertised as medium-firm, panel rated as 6/10Depth:25cmCover:unzip to wash at 60C (upper section); 40C (lower section)Turn or rotate:rotate monthly for six months, then every three monthsTrial period:200 nightsWarranty:10 yearsOld mattress recycling:not offeredSustainability credentials:Emma’sSecond Lifeprogramme refurbishes returned mattresses for resale; the company aims to “uphold human, environmental and labour rights” and achieve net zero by 2030DeliveryView image in fullscreenRoll with it: the Hybrid Premium was delivered by courier rather than an in-house team.Photograph: Jane Hoskyn/The GuardianEmma’s reputation for customer service could be better. OnTrustpilot, the UK’s most widely used customer feedback platform, Emma receives a higher proportion of one-star reviews and a lower proportion of five-star reviews than comparable companies whose products I’ve reviewed, including Dunelm, Simba, Otty, Dreams and Woolroom. Only Ikea fares worse (much worse, it’s fair to say).We asked Emma’s CEO and founder, Dennis Schmoltzi, what the company has done to address the mixed feedback. “[Some older reviews] don’t represent the experience we work hard to deliver in the UK today,” he said. “Over the past 12 months, we have redesigned our supply chain, improved inventory management, invested in customer support and overhauled our delivery process.”Even so, my expectations were limited when I placed my order for a double Emma Hybrid Premium. I wasn’t keen on the upselling attempts (I definitely didn’t add that pillow to my cart by myself), and I would have welcomed an offer to take away my old mattress. However, for speed, tracking and efficiency, I have no complaints about Emma’s delivery.I placed the order on a Friday, received tracking texts on a Monday with a two-hour delivery window, and had the mattress delivered by my familiar local DPD guy on Wednesday morning (Emma also delivers via UPS and Rhenus). This was my first DPD mattress delivery, contrasting with the in-house teams who delivered theIkea Valevågand theTempur, and the furniture specialists who delivered others. There was no offer to carry it upstairs for me, but you can pay an extra £35 for delivery to the room of your choice.Fortunately, the Hybrid Premium is quite light, so Alan and I had no trouble hefting it ourselves. I also found it much easier to unpack than most bed-in-a-box hybrids, not least because it comes wrapped in far less plastic than, say, the Simba or the Origin.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe FilterFree weekly newsletterGet the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

Delivery was quick, unboxing was easy, and it felt wonderfully comfortable to lie on. My husband and our helpful local family members agreed: Emma was a hit.Its foam and springs strike a lovely balance between softness and support, which feels consistent wherever you lie on the mattress. I asked Alan to take a photo of me lying down on my side, so I could see how well my spine aligned. Good spinal alignment is important for avoiding back pain from a mattress, and judging by our quick check, the Hybrid Premium was a good match for me. My hip felt cradled, and my upper back felt supported.The Hybrid Premium has good motion isolation, with the slim foam layers absorbing our movements whenever we turned over. Oddly, though, we both thought the mattress felt bouncy when we sat on it. This may be because the springs take up significantly more space than the foam.This composition makes for a lightweight mattress that’s airy and breathable, as well as being easy to manoeuvre. The fabric cover doesn’t have cooling properties like theTempur SmartCool’s cover, and the foam isn’t infused with cooling materials like Panda’smattress topper; in fact, it feels warm and snuggly to touch. Yet the airiness of the mattress itself helped it achieve excellent results in our heat-retention tests, so it’s a great choice if you tend to overheat at night.What we don’t loveView image in fullscreen‘While my shoulders and knees felt well supported, my hips did not.’Photograph: Jane Hoskyn/The GuardianI enjoyed my first encounter with the Hybrid Premium enough to genuinely look forward to sleeping on it. However, once I’d spent a few hours on it, I found myself craving a return to the much firmer Otty Original Hybrid – the only mattress I’ve bought after testing. I wanted to give the Emma a few weeks to get used to, but my lower back protested so much that I couldn’t quite make it to a full week.This surprised me. Not only had I found it comfy on first try, but I’m small and I sleep on my side – two factors that should make me a better fit for the softer end of medium firm. In practice, while my shoulders and knees felt well supported, my hips did not, and the muscles in my lower back took the strain. Alan had a similar experience.As with many modern mattresses, the Hybrid Premium claims to have a “zoned” system that provides more support for your back versus more cushioning for pressure points, such as hips and shoulders, but none of my family noticed this. There was no visible evidence of zoned areas, and neither Alan (5ft 10in) nor I (5ft on my tiptoes) felt additional support under any particular points of our bodies. We re-ran our sinkage tests at different spots on the sleeping surface to correspond roughly with pressure points and back support, and found no discernible pattern. In fact, we were impressed by the consistency of the mattress’s tension – it just wasn’t firm enough for our preferences.View image in fullscreenThe mattress was tested on a wooden slatted bed base.Photograph: Jane Hoskyn/The GuardianYou may not feel the same as us. Firmness preference varies widely, and it’s a big part of choosing a mattress. Our slatted Ikea bed base will have had a slight impact on our impressions of the mattress’s firmness; a solid bed base – such as a divan – would add a slightly more supportive foundation. But even on the firmest foundation, foam always softens in its first few months, and this mattress will feel softer than medium-firm after you’ve slept on it for a while.On a less subjective note, my Hybrid Premium never seemed to expand fully. The fabric along the sides remained a little creased, and a fold down the middle never disappeared. These are minor quibbles that didn’t affect my comfort or sleep.I usually donate my test mattresses to Southampton hardship charityScratch, but I wanted to test the mattress’s free trial, considering Emma’s customer service history. Initiating my return was quick and easy online. Emma tried to dissuade me by offering a complimentarymattress topper, but a quick “thanks but no thanks” sufficed, and they accepted my return in principle.The mattress was collected a week later by furniture specialists Rhenus, who brought a mattress-sized plastic bag, and Emma issued my refund just two days after that. Emma’s terms and conditions – similar to those of any mattress company – state that the returning mattress should be undamaged (“We may reduce your refund of the price [excluding delivery costs] to reflect any reduction in value of the product”), so it’s wise to use a mattress protector and sheets throughout the free trial period.SustainabilityView image in fullscreenEmma has plans to be net zero by 2030.Photograph: Jane Hoskyn/The GuardianThe Emma website doesn’t have much to say on green matters. There’s no sustainability section, no mention of certifications, such as CertiPur or Planet Mark, and no offer to recycle your old mattress. I am, though, reassured by a deeper dig into the company’s activities, and by the packaging and composition of this mattress.As mentioned, the Emma came wrapped in less plastic than its bulkier rivals. Its relatively light weight and low foam content suggest a smaller carbon footprint, too. Memory foam (high-viscosity polyurethane foam) is chemical-intensive to manufacture and isn’t biodegradable, so the Emma earns green points by not containing very much of it. Springs and fabric are also much easier to recycle.Behind the scenes, Emma uses the Waro platform to monitor its carbon footprint and suggest improvements. Emma has statedvia Warothat it aims to be net zero by 2030, and itsCorporate Social Responsibilitystatement pledges to “uphold human, environmental and labour rights”.Emma Hybrid Premium: should I buy it?The Hybrid Premium isn’t really a “premium” mattress in either price or composition. It’s a worthwhile buy if you’re after a medium-tension mattress that’s easy to manoeuvre and doesn’t overheat when you sleep, but don’t expect too much in the way of support or durability, especially if you have a larger build. My undercover experience of Emma’s delivery and customer service was good, but I’m now waiting to see whether its free trial, typical of bed-in-a-box companies, is quite as hassle-free as it sounds.View at EmmaFor more:The best mattress toppers, testedHow to choose a mattressI tested the most-hyped sleep aids – here’s what workedJane Hoskyn is a features journalist and WFH pioneer with three decades of experience in rearranging bookshelves and “testing” coffee machines while deadlines loom.

Established in 1959 by Aldo Albanesi, and now run by his sons Adriano and Alessandro, Albanesi is wondrous also for its size. Behind an 11-window shopfront lies almost 500 sq m of shop floor, and a small maze of laboratories in which almost everything that can be made is made: bread, pizza, pies, cakes, biscuits, fresh egg pasta, sauces, baked pasta and other dishes that are ready to eat. The snake of glass-fronted counters also hold cheese, other dairy products, cured meats, and vegetables and olives preserved in various ways, while the shelves are packed with everyday provisions of good and practical quality. This is a shop with something for everyone.It also sellsacini dipepe, a tiny pasta shaped like peppercorns and made of durum wheat, andpastina, another small pasta used mostly in soups or for stuffing into vegetables. Acini di pepe was the reason we first visited the shop six years ago, on the recommendation of a colleague, and at a time when I was writinga book about pastaand therefore trying to get my hands on as many shapes as possible. On that first visit I boughtstelline(stars),alfabeto,puntine(dots) andrisoni, of course, which is pretty much the same shape as orzo, only not called orzo in Italy, because that word means “barley”.I am repeating myself, I know, when I say that bags of pastina are the most satisfying bags of pasta to take from the shelf and move around in your hand, because they slide in much the same way as a beanbag does when it meets a bum. I also like measuring out small pasta shapes, raining them into the scale or, if you are sure enough, straight into a pan of boiling water. To make this week’s recipe, you need 300g of any small pasta shape (peppercorns, stars, letters, points, orzo) to fill eight red pepper boats. You also need to par-cook the pasta for half the recommended cooking time, then drain very well and spread out, if possible: you don’t want it to continue cooking, because it has to spend another 40 minutes in the oven.The peppers can be eaten straight away, but they’ll sit happily for hours, days even; just keep them in the fridge if the wait is longer than a few hours, and remember to take them out in advance. They are wondrous eaten at room temperature (or quickly reheated), especially after a long day.Red peppers stuffed with orzo, tuna, capers and herbsServes44 mediumredor/and yellow peppers, all even in size300g orzo, or other very small pasta shapeExtra-virgin olive oilButter1 red onion, peeled and diced1garlic clove, peeled and minced1 handful fresh parsley, minced1 medium-sized tomato, or several cherry tomatoes, finely chopped100g tuna packed in olive oil, drained1 heaped tbspsmall capers2 anchovy fillets, mincedCut the peppers in half lengthways through the stalks, scrape out the seeds and trim away any white pith inside. Boil the orzo in salted water for a half the recommended cooking time (if it suggests, say, 10 minutes, cook it for only five), then drain well.Working in a frying pan, warm a few tablespoons of olive oil and a bit of butter, then fry the onion and garlic until soft. Add the par-cooked orzo, parsley, tomato, tuna, capers and anchovies, then taste and season with salt as needed (it probably won’t need much) and generously with black pepper.Fill the pepper boats almost to the brim with the orzo mixture and arrange them snugly in a suitable baking tray. Spoon three tablespoons of water and three tablespoons of oil into the bottom of the trat, cover loosely but completely with foil, and bake at 180C (160C fan)/350F/gas 4 for 40 minutes, removing the foil for the last 10 minutes. Before serving, finish by zigzagging each pepper with a bit of olive oil, or spooning over some melted butter and anchovies, or thinning some basil pesto with extra-virgin olive oil, spooning that over the peppers and topping each half-pepper with a basil leaf.This article was amended on 9 October 2025 to include the oven temperature.Explore more on these topicsItalian food and drinkA kitchen in RomeFoodVegetablesPastaMain courseStarterFishrecipesShareReuse this content"

If any of those collections of words mean anything to you (keep your double entendres to yourself, please), you may have fuzzy yet painful memories of bag-in-box wine. The cheapness and the format – not to mention the sheer volume you can buy it for – makes bag-in-box ripe for drinking games.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.These fond (?) memories might result in an assumption that all bag-in-box wine is of a lesser quality, something designed for inexpensive and quick intoxication, rather than tasteful enjoyment. But interest in bag-in-box is on the rise, with the UK market expected torise to more than £300m by 2030 – almost double what it was in 2021.Why the spike in interest? My best guess is that people are drinking less and, once opened, your average bag-in-box will stay fresh for about six whole weeks. Many of us are (or have recently become) the type of drinker who savours a single glass of wine every so often after work, but never drink enough in the week to finish an entire bottle, so the rest is often given as a little treat to the sink.The sorts of wines you’re likely to find in bags are what you’d expect: bright, fresh, relatively simple stuff that’s designed to be drunk within weeks, not years. And although a boxed wine will last longer once it’s open than wine in a bottle, the plastic used in production ispermeable, meaning the wine will gradually spoil due to contact with oxygen, even if it remains unopened.It’s smart buying decisions that determine what wines make it into my bags. My pal Freddy Bulmer is a buyer atthe Wine Society, a place with a bag-in-box offering that impresses me with each and every new addition, so I asked him why they’re putting so much stock in the category. “One thing that we really care about in the wine industry is the sustainability angle. Bag-in-box can be a solution to a lot of those industry concerns. For example, shipping over a huge, 24,000-litre flexitank full of wine that can then be put into bags in the UK is far more sustainable than sending thousands of individual glass bottles around the world.”Large retailers such as the Wine Society and our major supermarkets have embraced the format to meet the needs of the modern drinker, but there are some brands that have been founded on selling solely bag-in-box, which if nothing else is an expression of confidence in the future of the category. One such business isBobo Wines, which sells beautifully designed, handwritten boxes (I’m a sucker for a good bit of packaging design) that look as if they’ve been plucked straight out of the cellar by Bobo’s buyer, the sommelier, writer and educator Amber Gardner.

Does it explain why Republicans are drinking less?J Oliver ConroyThu 9 Oct 2025 07.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 9 Oct 2025 07.02 EDTShareButterworth’s, an eclectically decorated restaurant in Washington DC, is an unofficial lounge of the Maga elite. A nameplate on one table declares it the official “nook” of Raheem Kassam, the former adviser to the rightwing British politician Nigel Farage and a co-owner of the restaurant.Steve Bannonis also frequently sighted holding court over Carolina gold rice – though the signature dish is bone-marrow escargot, which some young Maga politicos swear is good for your collagen.When he opened the farm-to-table brasserie in 2024, Bart Hutchins, Butterworth’s chef and one of its partners, was determined to resist what he sees as “the new puritanism” of wellness and sobriety culture. Hutchins finds non-alcoholic “mocktails” annoying on principle. “I did this edict, where I was like, ‘I’m not stocking that stuff,’” he said. “If you want to drink a glass of juice, just ask for a glass of juice; I’m not gonna pretend it’s a cocktail.”Hutchins has never felt teetotalism’s temptation, he told me, and his memory of drinks marketed as alcohol alternatives, like the near-beer O’Doul’s, was that they were “terrible”. But lately, as more Republican staffers, pundits and politicians patronize Butterworth’s antler-bedecked environs, a fifth column of non-drinkers has quietly undermined his anti-mocktail edict.It’s not just at Butterworth’s where rightwingers are drinking less. A Gallup poll in August found that the share of Americans of any political stripe who say they consumealcohol is at its lowestin nearly 90 years – though by only one percentage point. More strikingly,Republicansare the group, of the many demographic cohorts measured, that has turned most aggressively to sobriety.Gallup, which has asked Americans about their alcohol use since the 1930s, found in 2023 that 65% of Republicans said they drink alcohol – about the same as Democrats and independents. Just two years later, in 2025, that number has plunged a staggering 19 points to 46%.Democratsand independents also report drinking less, but each only by single digits. (All the results are self-reported; Gallup took participants at their word.)The decline is surprising and “statistically significant”, Lydia Saad, the director of US social research at Gallup, told me – though she has “no real hypothesis” for the sudden rise of Republican teetotalism.View image in fullscreenA bartender makes drinks at Butterworth’s in Washington DC in January.Photograph: The Washington Post/Getty ImagesLaurence Whyatt, an analyst at Barclays who covers the beverage industry, “can’t explain it” either. He suspects the broader US decline in drinking may have to do with pandemic-era inflation and belt-tightening and may not last. “But there’s no obvious reason why Republicans would be drinking less,” he said. “Of course, I’m aware that some prominent Republicans don’t drink. Could that be the reason?”Yet theories abound. Perhaps this is another manifestation of the cult of personality aroundDonald Trump, a Diet Coke enthusiast. Maybe the rising tide of Christian nationalism has revived an old-fashioned Protestant temperance. Or perhaps red-blooded rightwingers, eager to“Make America healthy again”, are eschewing beer, barbecues and bourbon to become the sort of smoothie-drinking health nuts they might once have mocked.Prominent rightwing or right-adjacent abstainers include Trump himself, whose older brother died of alcoholism-related heart attack;Robert F KennedyJr (who has spoken about his own substance problems); Tucker Carlson (a recovering alcoholic); and the activist Charlie Kirk (for health reasons).JD Vancedrinks, but his predecessor Mike Pence, a devout born-again Christian, did not. Joe Rogan, the podcaster and gym-bro whisperer who endorsed Trump in 2024, quit drinking this year for health reasons.“None of my core team [of colleagues] under 30 drinks,” Bannon, who hosts the podcast War Room, said in a text message.The world is reshaping in front of our eyes … It’s hard to imagine spending three hours getting loaded middayTucker CarlsonThe War Room’s 24-year-old White House correspondent, Natalie Winters, does not drink for health reasons – nor wear perfume, consume seed oils or drink fluoridated tap water. Earlier this year a friend of hers told the Times of London that elective sobriety had become common and accepted in rightwing political circles. “Here you don’t second-guess,” the friend said. “In London if someone isn’t drinking, you think they have an alcohol problem. Here it’s either that, or they’re Mormon, or because they’re focused on health.”Carlson, speaking to me by phone as he returned from grouse hunting with his dogs, said he had noticed that young conservatives, particularly men, were far more health-conscious than they once were. When he came up as a journalist, he said, the milieu was awash in booze and cigarette smoke. “I’m just from a different world. When I was 25, the health question was ‘filter or non-filter?’” he said. “And I always went with non-filter.”Carlson quit drinking in 2002, after a spiral whose nadir saw him having two double screwdrivers for breakfast. He said he was surprised – but happy – to see people today, even those who are not problem drinkers, quitting or moderating their consumption. The Athletic Brewing Company’s alcohol-free beers are popular, he has noticed, and not just among “sad rehab cases like me. I think it’s normal young people.”Carlson – who has recently offered a range of unorthodox health advice including usingnicotine to improve focusandtesticle tanningto improve testosterone levels – says political professionals and journalists today also inhabit a 24/7 news cycle in which “there’s just, substantively, a lot more going on; the world is reshaping in front of our eyes,” he said. “I think there’s an incentive to pay attention in a way that there wasn’t before. It’s just kind of hard to imagine spending three hours away from your phone – or three hours, like, getting loaded midday.”View image in fullscreenTucker Carlson arrives for a memorial service for Charlie Kirk in Glendale, Arizona, on 21 September.Photograph: Carlos Barría/ReutersHutchins, Butterworth’s chef, noticed when diners, including those he considered “reasonable people, and not insufferable”, kept asking for non-alcoholic options. The restaurant was gradually “brought over to the dark side”, he said, ruefully. He tested a few zero-proof drinks that he deemed respectable enough to serve beside marrow without shame.Many patrons still drink enthusiastically, and by 10pm most nights the atmosphere is “pretty bacchanalian”, he said. But Butterworth’s now offers a pre-packaged alcohol-free Negroni, verjus (a wine alternative made from unripe grapes) and non-alcoholic Guinness (“super popular”, Hutchins said).Changing health attitudes are probably a factor in the broader decline in US alcohol consumption. Recent research has cast doubt on the idea that even moderate drinking is an acceptable health risk. In January, the US surgeon general suggested that alcohol bottles should carry warnings that drinking can contribute to cancer.Malcolm Purinton, a beer historian at Northeastern University, noted that many young people learned adult socialization during Covid lockdowns, meaning their relationship with alcohol may differ from that of their parents or older siblings. People turning 21, the legal drinking age, do not necessarily see drinking as cool.“There’s always some form of rebellion between generations,” he said. Thanks to the cruel march of time, for instance, craft beer – which millennials once embraced as a sophisticated alternative to their fathers’ Miller Lites – is now itself a “dad drink”.Yet none of this explains the dramatic shift among Republicans. Nor does it explain another odd anomaly: the same Gallup poll found that Republicans, despite reporting drinking less than other groups, were less likely than Democrats or independents to say they viewed moderate drinking as dangerous.Some observers suggest the shift may have more to do with who now identifies as Republican. “Republicans made a big push in toss-up states such as Arizona and Pennsylvania in 2024 to register more Republicans, especially among far-right Christians, Mormons and Amish,” Mark Will-Weber, the author of a book on US presidents’ drinking habits, told the Financial Times in August. “These religious groups abstain from alcohol.”Saad is not sure. Republican respondents report drinking less regardless of other factors such as religiosity, she noted. “We’re not seeing anything that would tell us, you know, ‘It’s religious Republicans,’ ‘It’s pro-Trump Republicans,’ ‘It’s Republicans paying attention to the news.’ It’s really across the board.”It’s also difficult to determine the ideological correlation with sobriety. Although rightwing parties have gained ground in many other countries in recent years, Whyatt said, those places have not typically seen the same “aggressive decline in consumption”. The phenomenon seems specific to conservative Americans.The top-performing people I’ve ever been around are very against alcohol, against substancesCharlie KirkThe best guess may be that Republicans have turned against alcohol for the same economic and health reasons that Americans in general have – but amplified by “Make America healthy again” politics (with its hostility to vaccines and chemicals, and its faint granola paranoia) and a self-help podcast culture popular on the right that extols wellness, discipline, and treating your body like a temple.Months before his death, Charlie Kirk spoke on his podcast about the reasons he had quit drinking. He said he had done so “four or five” years earlier to improve his sleep and general health. Sobriety was “becoming trendier”, he argued, listing Trump, Carlson, Elon Musk and the Christian pundit Dennis Prager among prominent conservatives who don’t drink – or, in Musk’s case, don’t often.“The top-performing people I’ve ever been around,” Kirk said, “are very against alcohol, against substances. They’ll tell you they perform better, think clearer, have better memory, better recall, more energy, more pace. And I [also] find that some of the people who drink the most, they’re hiding something, they’re masking something.”Raging bulls: why Maga is pushing cow products on to AmericaRead moreMost experts acknowledged that it is too soon to tell whether this new sobriety will stick. “You can tie yourself in knots trying to solve those puzzles,” said Saad, the Gallup pollster. “We’re going to just have to wait and see if this holds up next year … maybe by then we’ll see other groups catch up.”Hutchins said Butterworth’s will continue to cater to drinkers and non-drinkers, just as it caters to diners of all political persuasions. But one group of patrons, he added, seems particularly unsettled by the sight of conservatives – or anyone – succumbing to the vice of sobriety.“We have a lot of British clientele, for some reason,” he said. “As soon as some new [British] journalist or diplomat type moves to DC, they come here. And they all say: ‘Nobody drinks here. Nobody even has martinis at lunch. What is happening in this country?’”Explore more on these topicsUS politicsAlcoholWashington DCFoodfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Like many parents across the nation, she was horrified to learn about the 27 Augustshootingat a Catholic school in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Two children were killed and 17 other people were injured.Gabriela is one of 10 parents who joined a WhatsApp group to regularly chat with Guardian journalists about how it feels to raise kids now. Less than two weeks after the mass shooting in Minneapolis,Charlie Kirkwas shot at Utah Valley University. On the same day, another school shooting occurred in Evergreen, Colorado.The Guardian asked the parents about their experiences amid so much school and political violence.How do you talk to kids about violence in the news? We asked expertsRead moreHow are you all feeling in the wake of these shootings and violent events?All of the parents in the group expressed near-constant fear over the possibility of a school shooting or violence in schools.Gabriela said her son just had his first school lockdown drill as a kindergartener: “It does break my heart that these drills are now more common than the fire and earthquake drills of our day.”Other parents like David Rodriguez, a barber who lives in Pharr, Texas, echoed the sentiment, saying that for him it used to be tornado drills, not active-shooter drills. He said the Minneapolis shooting hit particularly close to home, as the Uvalde school shooting happened about a four-hour drive from where he lives with his wife and five-year-old son, Russell.Assassination in Utah, school shooting in Colorado: one day in US gun violenceRead moreRussell just started kindergarten in August, but he also already has had an active-shooter drill at his elementary school. David said the experience terrified his son: “The alarms had gone off unexpectedly and they had to hide and be quiet all within a minute.”After the drill, David and his wife did the best they could to explain what had happened and why. Then the five-year-old asked whether his dad would be able to come save him and his friends if there was a shooter at the school.“It struck a chord so hard in my body I started to cry,” David said. “I let him know I will always be by your side to protect you until my last breath.” David also told his son the police would come “faster than he ever could” but Russell continued to ask him if he would be there to protect his class.According toPew Research Center, a quarter of teachers say that their school had at least one gun-related lockdown in 2023. Two parents from our Guardian group shared that since the school year began around late August, their kid’s school had already had a real threat that triggered a temporary lockdown.Isabel Hernandez, another parent from the WhatsApp group, had no idea there had been a threat at the San Bernardino high school that her daughter Alina attends until 6pm the day it happened. The school’s security team received a tip about a weapon on campus and were able to recover it “without incident”. Alina had been off campus for a water polo game, but Hernandez was still frustrated by the lack of communication.View image in fullscreenIsabel Hernandez had no idea there had been a threat at the high school her daughter Alina attends until 6pm the day it happened.Photograph: Courtesy of Isabel HernandezAlba Ávila’s 17-year-old daughter Bella also experienced a lockdown last year when a student brought a gun on to her high school campus: “She texted me and told me she loved us and saying goodbye. It was heartbreaking.”This year, her daughter’s school has banned cellphones, so she and her husband have no way of getting in touch with her if there were to be an emergency: “All I have to do is pray she will come home.”Have your kids seen news about the shootings on social media?The shooting of Charlie Kirk at the University of Utah on 10 September also reverberated within the Guardian parents group. When asking the parents again about their reactions to the news, there were fewer, more distraught answers.Isabel Hernandez, whose eldest child Alina had recently had the lockdown at her school, has two other daughters Natalia, 12, and Valentina, 3. Both Alina and Natalia had seen the video of the shooting on TikTok, and Alina also showed her mother clips circulating of Charlie Kirk’s speeches and debates, which Isabel described as “not so nice”.“I explained to her I really didn’t know who he was [before the shooting]. No one should ever be killed because they don’t have the same beliefs or values as another person,” she said.“It’s hard for us parents explaining these things to our children. I just wish these shootings didn’t have to happen so often.”How do you cope with your fears for your kids’ safety?Some of the parents found that taking any action, including volunteering in their children’s schools, helped ease some of their anxieties. Along with other support roles, Alba checks in school visitors at the front desk of her son’s elementary school. She scans their IDs, which immediately go through the Raptor system, a software that quickly searches for those people in sex-offender and other databases. Earlier this year, she stopped a person from entering the school after they had been flagged by the database.View image in fullscreenAlong with other support roles, Alba checks in school visitors at the front desk of her son’s elementary school.Photograph: Courtesy of Alba AvilaDavid also volunteers at his son’s school, which is equipped with the Raptor system, as well as bulletproof doors and armed guards. He acknowledged the importance of the precautions but said it takes away from the normal childhood experience. Due to school policy, they weren’t allowed to walk Russell to his classroom for the first time.Jennifer Wilson, a courtesy clerk at Albertsons grocery in Bakersfield, California, said that she’s trained her son Joaquin to always run from violence or fights at school: “When it comes to school shootings … I pray for my kid’s safety. That’s all I can do. He has to go to school.”This article was amended on 9 October 2025. An earlier version said that Charlie Kirk was killed at the University of Utah. It should have said the Utah Valley University."

They may not make you happier thoughZoe WilliamsThu 9 Oct 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 9 Oct 2025 12.42 EDTShare‘Are you sure you want that one?” asks the assistant in the flagship Waterstones store in Piccadilly, London. I’d picked up a classic self-help book, Thinking, Fast and Slow, by Daniel Kahneman, amid a tranche of the much more fashionable titles such as The Let Them Theory; Fawning; The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck; The Courage to Be Disliked. “Is that not the one everyone’s reading?” I ask. She hands me the cloth-bound Don’t Believe Everything You Think. “Thisis the one everyone’s reading.”Self-help book sales in the UK grew every year between 2015 and 2023,according to Nielsen. And that’s just the overt titles, not counting “stealth-help” (memoir, nature writing, bibliotherapy – poems and what’s considered likely to cheer you up). But the books shifting the most units in recent years are a very specific tranche of self-help: the idea that you help yourself by only looking out for number one. Some are about stopping trying to please other people; others say stop thinking about them altogether. What could I learn from reading them?Fawning: Why the Need to Please Makes Us Lose Ourselves and How to Find Our Way Back, by the US psychologist Dr Ingrid Clayton, is the latest book in the selfish self-help subgenre. You’ve probably heard of “fight, flight or freeze” – the body’s primal responses to threat. Flight is a great response if, for example, you meet a tiger. It’s not so helpful in a work meeting. “Fawning” is a new addition to the trauma response lexicon and, Clayton writes, is distinct from the well-worn terms “people-pleasing” and “co-dependency” (though she says they are “branches on the overall fawning tree”). Often, fawning behaviour is politically reinforced by the patriarchy and “white body supremacy” (an attitude that elevates whiteness as the standard by which to judge everyone). So fawning is not your fault, but it is your problem, because it entails stifling your thoughts and feelings, sidelining your needs and imperatives, to mollify another person in the moment.Clayton’s book is good: expert, vulnerable, disarming, thoughtful. Nevertheless, itlands squarely on the self-help question of our time: “What would you do if you were putting yourself first in your own life?”View image in fullscreenJust a few of the self-help books that are jumping off the shelves.Photograph: David Levene/The GuardianMel Robbins has sold 6m copies of her book The Let Them Theory, and has 11m followers on Instagram. Her philosophy is that not only should you put yourself first (which she calls “let me”), you have to also let others putthemselvesfirst (“let them”). For example: “Let my family be late to absolutely everything we go to,” she writes. “Let the neighbour’s dog bark all day.” There’s an intellectual honesty to this, in so far as it asks readers to consider not just what would happen if they lived more selfishly, but if everybody did. But at the same time, Robbins’s tone is “wise up” – everyone else is already letting their dog bark all day. If you can’t embrace the “let them, let me” credo, you’ll be stuck in a world where you’re worrying about the negative opinions of others, and – newsflash – they’re not worrying about yours. This will consume your time, energy and emotional headroom, to the extent that, ultimately, you won’t be in charge of your own trajectory. That’s what she says to packed theatres on her global tours – London this year; New Zealand, Australia and the US (again) next. She has been a lawyer, a broadcaster, a podcaster; she’s been riding high and shot down like a broad from a Frank Sinatra song. But, essentially, she’s someone to whom people listen – whether her words are in a book, on Instagram or spoken live.I do not want to sound like a second-wave feminist, but the male authors in this terrain are basically the same, but stupider. Mark Manson’s The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck: A Counterintuitive Approach to Living a Good Life frames the problem slightly differently: seeking the approval of others is just one of a number of fallacies – along with seeking happiness, “victimhood chic”, the “responsibility/fault fallacy” – getting in between you and your goal, which is to not give a fuck. Manson started blogging dating advice in 2008, before graduating to everything advice.The Let Them theory is not only should you put yourself first, you have to also let others put themselves firstIchiro Kishimi and Fumitake Koga’s The Courage to Be Disliked – which has sold 10m copies, and “can change your life” (according to it) – is written as a dialogue between a prominent Japanese philosopher and psychologist (Kishimi) and a youth (Koga is 52; hell, let’s call him a youth). It is based on the precept that Freud was wrong, and his contemporary Alfred Adler (we’ll come back to Adler) was right – the past doesn’t matter; only your goals matter. Freud was an aetiologist (looking for causes); Adler was a teleologist (explaining behaviour in terms of the purpose it serves, rather than its root). From here, all problems become interpersonal problems (which is absolutely true unless your problem, for example, is that your local food bank just flooded and you have nothing to feed your baby; but I guess the baby is still a person, so fine). And therefore it follows that being disliked by other people “is proof that you are exercising your freedom and living in freedom”.Joseph Nguyen’s 2022 book Don’t Believe Everything You Think: Why Your Thinking Is the Beginning and End of Suffering is a global bestseller. He makes a similar case, based on wisdom from Zen monks – who themselves are a patchwork of parables, rather than actual monks – that all negative emotions are generated not by circumstances or past events, but by the way we think about them. His prescription is even simpler: stop thinking. I’m not joking. By chapter 7, we’re into “Practical steps for how to stop thinking” (they are – pause, take a beat; ask yourself whether your thinking is taking you in a good direction; understand that you have a choice to stop thinking; say a mantra, maybe “thinking is the root cause of suffering”, or “stop thinking, idiot”; finally, experience the feeling, without putting any thoughts on it. Yes, these steps – pause, ask, understand, say and experience – spell PAUSE; well spotted).These radical self-reliance books are on a spectrum, from the smart and well-researched to the less smart. All are threaded together by their confidence, but what self-help book has ever not had that? One thing is certain – it’s falling on parched earth, hitting a help-thirsty world in its most receptive spot. People are waiting for permission to live their best, Ayn Randian life, one in which your only moral purpose is your own happiness, and anyone who can convincingly give that permission – well, I wouldn’t want to speculate ontheirfulfilment, but they’re definitely minted (opinion is divided on wealth and its place in the firmament of meaning).Laurie Santos, a psychology professor at Yale University, speaking to me by email, betrays some impatience with the idea that self-reliance will bring wellbeing. “Study after study shows the opposite. We often think we’ll be happiest when we focus on ourselves, but one of the most reliable ways to boost our own happiness is by focusing on others. I always tell my students that self-care is a misnomer. Becoming other-oriented boosts our mood and gives us a sense of purpose.” Santos points to research fromHarvard Business School, which shows: “Spending money on others makes us happier than spending that same amount of money on ourselves. What’s fascinating is that this effecthas been replicated across culturesand income levels, suggesting that the happiness benefits of giving are universal and deeply rooted in human nature.”The language of boundaries – and the attendant motives for and consequences of laying them out, which are not giving a fuck and being disliked – tends not to speak of money. Clayton has thoughts on the way fawners annihilate themselves by giving away all their money (she describes one client who was found to be distributing 82% of her disposable income on others). Generally, though, the parables of the successful boundary are described through emotional dynamics – a careless family, an undermining boss, a self-involved partner. The lessons of the successful “let them”/“fuck them” relationship are to deprioritise the unsatisfying. It’s not that generosity is considered in these equations and found to be less important, rather that the circuitry is never activated.View image in fullscreenThe courage to be disliked? … Zoe Williams tells it like it is.Composite: Guardian Design;  David Levene“There’s also lots of work showing that our social connection is super important for happiness,” Santos writes. She points toa 2002 studypublished by the Association for Psychological Science journal that found that social connection was a necessary condition for being truly happy with life. “I worry that some of these individualist, self-reliant strategies miss that,” she says. Robbins, with her immense engagement on social media, has been challenged on this, and writes in her book: “Some people have shared that they feel lonely after using the Let Them Theory. If you’re feeling this way, it’s a sign that you’re applying the theory incorrectly.” It’s not a pass to ghost people who are getting on your nerves, it’s an invitation to take responsibility for what you want and pursue it. If you end up lonely, it’s because you’re not taking enough responsibility (surely you didn’t want to be lonely?).What self-reliance theory, even the best of it, doesn’t address is just how much social connection starts with something you don’t especially want to do. For example, on a very regular basis, you’ll probably have to leave the house in inclement weather. It’s been interesting to watch the evolution of comfort narratives, especially on social media – first discernible in the “hygge” fetish of 2016 (when it was shortlisted for Oxford Dictionary’s word of the year), an endless croon to the Scandi lifestyle of log fires, cosy socks, dimmed lights and not seeing anyone. Since then, it’s been problematised by reality –loneliness levels are rising. If history is made by people who show up, so is community.Taoic and Indic religions form a lot of the scaffolding of self-reliance, whether it’s the shaman who shows up for one of Clayton’s ex-fawner clients (to be real, this ends in a lovely story about some baby bears), the young Zen monks of Nguyen’s anti-thinking strategy, or a guest appearance from the actual Buddha, who, according to Manson, from a theological and philosophical perspective, didn’t give a fuck. This isn’t new. “Historically,” the eco-philosopher Rupert Read says, “religion and spirituality have been used again and again to promote resignation and fatalism. When you detach these religions and spiritualities from their cultural milieu, it’s quite easy to transform them into something that’s against their intent. There is a deep way in which a more communal and collective orientation towards life is prevalent in eastern cultures. Without that, practises of meditation and mindfulness come to seem like tools for individual self-development – sometimes for self-help, sometimes in a business context.”It boils down to this – the measure of mental health in a person is the degree of their interest in othersManu Bazzano is a psychotherapist who trained as an Adlerian and is also a Zen priest. “The funny thing is, in Zen practice, a good inner experience comes when we start doing something for other people – allow in concern for other people’s suffering and distress, and there is a lightening of my obsessive concern for myself.”So what is the end point of having the “courage to be disliked”? Congratulations, you now care so little about other people (their opinions, their feelings, their perspectives) that you no longer care about the past. Kishimi and Koga quote Adler in their book: “Trauma does not exist … no experience is in itself a cause of our success or failure.” “The self is determined, not by our experiences themselves but by themeaning we give them.” (These are Kishimi and Koga’s italics). This is indivisible from Nguyen’s ideas, and it’s true, Adler definitely did say that. Again, though, some context has been lost: Adler may have been relentlessly goal-oriented, but he was also “almost like a lefty, socialist counterpoint to Freud”, Bazzano says. The technical word for a sense of community, connectedness or belonging as psychoanalytic quantities –gemeinschaftsgefühl– was invented by Adler, who would be rolling in his grave if he knew he was here cast as the grandfather of Being Disliked. In fact, Kishimi and Koga’s book does discuss finding meaning in being of use to others, but in such a way that has entirely removed the perspective of others, which is a bit like helping an old lady across a road without checking that’s what she wanted. She hates that.Read too much of it – which I definitely have – and it comes to sound a bit Trumpy“It boils down to this,” Bazzano says. “The measure of mental health in a person is the degree of their interest in others. That could be their neighbours, or it could be social and political.”Ah, politics; with the exception of Clayton, who delves very deeply into the structural forces informing much of our collective fawn behaviour, the rest of these authors enjoin you, whatever the politics you’re living under, to suck it up. They often start with an anecdote about their own a-materiality – welcome to their past life, they’re in $800,000 of debt (Robbins) or they’ve just sold all their stuff and moved to South America (Manson). It sounds bad, right? Yet “we are often actually happier with less”, Manson writes. Anticonsumerism is a familiar trope on the left, as it is closely allied to anticapitalism, but in the context of self-reliance manuals, its vibe is more “stop bleating, there is no such thing as a victim”. Read too much of it (which I definitely have), and it comes to sound a bitTrumpy(“maybe the children will have two dolls, instead of 30”). It’s obvious, in a way – if you’re looking out for number one, the last thing you want to do is get politically organised, and if you’re not going to organise, you need to accept what’s in front of you.“Overall,” Santos says, “we have a bias toward whatNicholas Epley calls ‘undersociality’ – we are miscalibrated about how good all forms of connecting with others will make us feel.” Before you go all in on self-reliance, have you tried giving a fuck and being liked?Explore more on these topicsHealth & wellbeingHealth, mind and body booksHealthMental healthfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It was 2007, he was 24, and he had been arrested for firearms offences and conspiracy to commit robbery. He knew he was facing a long stretch inside, having previously served three years for possession of a firearm. He also knew his only chance of running was through the hospital wing, so had spent the day lying to guards, pretending that he had sustained a concussion during his arrest. When the holding cell doors opened, he figured that’s where he was going. Instead, he was cuffed and led away to a high-security unit (HSU).When McAvoy laid eyes on the unit, the magnitude of his situation hit home. “I thought: ‘I’m not going to see daylight for a long, long time.’”‘I wanted to be a billionaire’ … John McAvoy thought criminal life was like Hollywood.The Belmarsh HSU is a prison within a prison. Getting there requires a short drive on a bus through the main prison, beyond a dedicated gate and perimeter wall. There’s an airlock where door locks were operated remotely to prevent hostage taking.The spur on the HSU is small, with around eight cells, low ceilings and fluorescent lights. “We used to call it the submarine,” recalls McAvoy. “There’s no real natural sunlight. One of the wings hasn’t got any windows at all. It’s very, very claustrophobic.” There was an exercise yard, but the sky was blocked out by security wire. McAvoy’s fellow inmates included the radical preacher Abu Hamza and the failed 21/7 bombers.“This is the end of the world,” one of the prison governors told him. And it really could have been. But for McAvoy it was a beginning: the first unlikely step toward becoming the prolific endurance athlete he is today. By the time of his release in 2012, after spending nearly a decade of his life inside, he had broken three world records and seven British records in rowing – all from the confines of the prison gym.View image in fullscreen‘This is the end of the world’ … Belmarsh prison in Thamesmead, south-east London.Photograph: Aardvark/AlamyMcAvoy was born in London in the early 80s, and he and his sister were raised by his mother and five aunts. He never knew his biological father, who died a month before he was born. McAvoy’s mother worked as a florist. They didn’t have much money, “but she did everything she could to make sure her two children had everything they ever needed”. McAvoy was an energetic boy, sometimes naughty. His childhood home backed on to Crystal Palace Park in south-east London, where he’d make camps with his friends and poach fish from the lake.When McAvoy was eight, his mother brought home her new partner, Billy Tobin. Aside from the odd uncle or cousin, Tobin was the first permanent male presence McAvoy had had at home. Tobin was an armed robber. Not that McAvoy knew that at the time; he just found him intoxicating. He remembers Tobin’s charisma, his shiny black shoes, dark trousers and shirt. “Even though I was young, I could tell the stuff he had on was very expensive.” When Tobin went to say goodbye that day, he patted McAvoy on the head, called him a good boy and gave him a £20 note (the first time McAvoy had held paper money). Tobin became McAvoy’s stepfather soon afterwards. “It was just a really powerful experience.” McAvoy was a driven teenager, full of ambition. “I grew up in the era of Margaret Thatcher. It was all about the ‘me’. I wanted to own British Telecom. I wanted to be a billionaire.”At 14, he was tasked with watching duffle bags stuffed with £250,000 in cash … he was paid £1,000 for the jobAs he got older, McAvoy became aware of more criminal notoriety in his family tree. His uncle Micky McAvoy was part of the gang arrested for theBrink’s-Mat heist– one of the biggest robberies in British history, in which £26m in gold bullion, diamonds and cash was stolen from a warehouse at Heathrow Airport. McAvoy was 12 when he saw Fool’s Gold, the 1992 TV film based on the robbery, in which Sean Bean played his uncle. “It was one of the big moments of my childhood,” he says, “Sean Bean sitting on £26m worth of gold bars and it all being glamorised.” It wouldn’t be long before he became involved in his stepfather’s criminal world – at 14, Tobin tasked him with watching duffle bags stuffed with £250,000 in cash on their kitchen table before someone came to collect it. He was paid £1,000 for the job.View image in fullscreenJohn McAvoy’s uncle Micky McAvoy, who was played by Sean Bean in Fool’s Gold, the TV movie based on the Brink’s-Mat heist.Photograph: Trinity Mirror/Mirrorpix/AlamyWhen McAvoy was 16, he left school and bought a gun. Tobin was furious – he didn’t want McAvoy to do anything reckless. He confiscated the weapon and took his stepson under his wing. “I didn’t really have friends my own age,” he says. “From 15, I was with men who were in their 30s, 40s and 50s.” They were all wealthy criminals. “I spent as much time as I could around these people because I wanted to learn from them and I wanted to understand how that world operated.”Tobin put McAvoy to work, tracking cash-delivery vans, scouting targets and passing information up the chain of command. McAvoy was a shy teenager who struggled to communicate, but Tobin taught him to be assertive. He also taught him to never trust women, never talk in houses because they might be bugged, and to only trust people in your circle. He told him to never show weakness – and to detest authority. Anyone in the system – the government, judges, the police – was viewed as the enemy. “There was always this tone of anti-authority and how corrupt the system was. Obviously, I didn’t realise I was absorbing all this stuff.” There was a strict code of conduct among them too: “You don’t hurt women, you don’t hurt children, don’t hurt old people.”McAvoy knew that prison was a very real occupational hazard in his line of work. “I think it’s always in your subconscious but you think you’re going to be that one to live that Hollywood life, right? You’re going to be the one to sail off into the sunset.” He was being followed by police – he had found tracking devices on his car – and “was always very surveillance aware. You would sometimes spot the same person a couple of times.”McAvoy’s first arrest came at 18, after police thwarted a robbery with an estimated value of £250,000. He led the police in a motorway car chase, dumped the car (along with his gun) in south-east London, stripped down to his shorts (he’d been told to always wear shorts so you don’t look out of place when running) and continued on foot. After vaulting garden fences, he thought he’d escaped. He found a phone box and called a friend, but was then swarmed by armed police and arrested. McAvoy was sentenced to five years for possession of a firearm. He served three, one in solitary confinement.His second arrest came in 2005, two years after his release. Then 22, McAvoy was on his way to rob a security van carrying cash when he clocked an unmarked police car driving toward him. It was an ambush. The police had been investigating McAvoy and his associates for months.As armed officers spilled out of three police cars, McAvoy sped off, through the streets of south London.“I just remember this internal dialogue in my head, thinking: ‘I’m not going back to prison.’ And, honestly, I was fully prepared to die in that moment to get away from them.” After mounting a pavement and hitting a lamp-post, McAvoy ditched the car and bolted on foot, determined to outrun the helicopter above. He hit a dead end. The police caught up. They locked their guns on him. “I genuinely thought at that moment, ‘I’m gone’,” he says.McAvoy pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit robbery and one count of possession of firearms with intent to commit robbery. Three days later, he was transferred to Belmarsh.McAvoy was given a discretionary life sentence. His uncle Micky, who did 16 years for the Brink’s-Mat robbery, gave him some advice: stay connected to the real world. “I always kept myself in the present,” he says. He’d listen to the radio and watch the news. “I never got involved in prison politics. I used to think: ‘This is not my life. I just want to get out of this place as quick as I can and get my life back.’”He had one visit from his mum. It took a few weeks for the governor to clear it. She drove to the prison, then took the bus to the HSU, before sitting in a booth behind armoured glass. A prison officer sat behind McAvoy with a pen and paper. They weren’t allowed to speak in code, couldn’t cover their mouths, and there were cameras pointing at both of their faces. Abu Hamza was in the booth next to him having a legal visit. McAvoy was with his mum for 90 minutes. He clocked that it was a deeply traumatic experience for her. “I made a decision that day – I went back to my cell and she didn’t see me again until the day that I got out, nearly eight years later.”View image in fullscreen‘Being in prison shaped me as an athlete’ … McAvoy running in the French Alps in 2023.Photograph: James MitchellAt first, he couldn’t understand why he was on the same unit as terrorists. He expressed as much to a visitor from the Ministry of Justice, but was told they didn’t want to give him any opportunity to run. “You get seen as a piece of shit,” says McAvoy. “There was never any talk about rehabilitation or moving forward in life in a positive direction. It’s just like, that’s who you are, and that’s what you are, and that’s how you’re gonna stay for the rest of your life.”McAvoy was, he says, goal-obsessed. He read diligently, and kept fit by doing what he called “cell circuits” – thousands of sit-ups, step-ups and push-ups. He was comfortable in solitude and never struggled with boredom. “I never had mental health [issues] in there,” he says. “I never allowed my mind to drift too far in the future.”After two years in Belmarsh, he was transferred to Full Sutton, a maximum security prison in Yorkshire, before later being moved to Lowdham Grange, a category B prison in Nottinghamshire. At first, McAvoy’s goal was simple: play the game until he was moved into a low enough security prison, then abscond. “I thought the minute they give me an opportunity in a semi-open prison, I’m gone. And I’ll go to Europe, I’ll be living the lifestyle of a criminal. That was my mindset.”Three years into his sentence, however, all that changed. A close friend, Aaron, died in a car crash in the Netherlands. He’d been attempting to escape after robbing an ATM along with a couple of associates. McAvoy saw CCTV of the incident on a news report the following night.“That was the lowest I think I’ve ever been in my whole life,” he says. “It just made me have this massive reality check about my life and where I was and what I was doing.” It was a grim catalyst for change. “I felt lost. I didn’t know what I wanted to do and where I wanted to go. I was trapped in this physical environment and I needed to escape it. I needed to get away from the prisoners. I wanted my life to be something else than this.”McAvoy went to the prison gym. He noticed another prisoner on a rowing machine, who’d had more than the usual allotted time in the gym. He enquired and the prisoner told him he was rowing 1m metres for a children’s charity. McAvoy asked the gym officer if he could do the same. That is how he started rowing.Rowing was like meditation. It was very rhythmical“I didn’t know what I was doing. I didn’t know anything about technique. But when I was on that machine, it was like I created this portal that took me out of prison. Everyone left me alone. No one spoke to me. I was in my own thoughts and then it was like meditation. It was very rhythmical.” He suspects now that he’ddiscovered the runner’s high. “It was like the machine became an extension of my body.”McAvoy did the first 1mmetres in a month. He asked if he could do another sponsored row, and then another. Someone suggested he do the equivalent of rowing the Atlantic Ocean – 5,000km. “I thought it’d be quite a nice thing to do and to say I’d achieved.” One evening, as he was coming toward the end of his latest charity effort, he decided to pound through a really hard 10,000 metres. A prison officer, Darren Davis, took an interest in his impressive performance. “A couple of days later he came back and gave me all the records that were set on an indoor row machine.”In just over a year, McAvoy broke three indoor rowing world records and seven British records. He smashed the fastest marathon by seven minutes, took the record for the longest continuous row (45 hours) and rowed the farthest distance in 24 hours (263,396m).View image in fullscreen‘He changed my life in prison’ … McAvoy, right, with Darren Davis after he’d broken the record for rowing the farthest distance in 24 hours in 2011.Photograph: Courtesy of John McAvoyMcAvoy hated Davis at first. He wasn’t interested in reform and saw the guard as an extension of the system. But Davis’s unwavering interest in McAvoy’s performances won him over. “He saw that I had that talent and he put that belief in me that I could achieve something else in my life.” Davis was present for all of McAvoy’s record-breaking efforts inside. He’d pull up a chair and sit with him. If McAvoy was doing a 24-hour row, Davis would take the day off, come in and stay with him the whole time, coaching him.“He changed my life in prison,” says McAvoy. “He wanted to help me for no other reason other than wanting to help me. There’s nothing in it other than the purity of a human that wanted to do something for someone else without anything in it for themselves.”Today, Davis is one of McAvoy’s best friends. “I knew when my friend died I would never commit a crime again, and I don’t know where that road would have taken me,” says McAvoy. “But I wouldn’t have the life I’ve got today unless Darren believed in me, then gave me the opportunities to use the gift that he saw I had.”McAvoy started studying for a personal trainer qualification in prison. When he was moved to Sudbury, a category D prison, he got a job as a trainer at aFitnessFirst gym. He’d catch a 7am bus from the prison, six days a week. In between training clients, he studied endurance athletes. Nine months later, in 2012, he was granted parole and released from prison. Just under eight years had passed since his second conviction. The first thing he did when he left prison was visit the grave of his friend Aaron.McAvoy had one goal: to become a professional athlete. At 30, he knew time wasn’t on his side, so he began training for a triathlon: he joined a rowing club, taught himself to swim via YouTube, bought his first bike and learned to ride. He’s since established himself as a formidable endurance athlete, running numerous ultramarathons, triathlons and Ironman events.“Being in prison and being in solitude and isolation for years, it definitely shaped me as an athlete,” he says. “I’ve been in a segregation cell … Everything else now to me is a privilege. It’s a luxury.”The race that stands out most to him is his Ironman debut in 2013, in Bolton town centre. He used to watch the contest in prison, and after his release had just six weeks to train for it. “I remember feeling this massive sense of achievement,” he says. “I’d probably say that’s one of my best performances in regards of the amount of time I trained to do it. And Darren was at the finishing line.”At first, McAvoy didn’t tell anyone he met through training about his past life. But as rumours began to swirl around his rowing club – where had this redoubtable machine been this whole time? – people began to Google him. He decided to share his story in a blog. He initially worried about the criticism. That people would say he’d done a lot of bad things and didn’t deserve to have what he’d now got; that he shouldn’t be put on a pedestal. But he is very careful not to glamorise his past life. In 2016, his memoir was published – and he’s had many offers to turn his life story into a film. But he has always turned them down.View image in fullscreen‘I was free again’ … McAvoy in the Alps.Photograph: James MitchellApart from sport, McAvoy campaigns for prison reform. Though he feels that there are some prisoners permanently tied to a life of organised crime, “the vast majority aren’t that and I genuinely do think you can help them,” he says. As a teenager, he romanticised criminal life.“It’s a very toxic, horrible world. Once you get in it, it’s very difficult to remove yourself from it … That’s why I can relate to a lot of these kids that end up in prison for gang stuff because I understand how they can get sucked into that world. It’s very difficult for them to see anything outside that until they get to a point of growing up and maturing.”Through his prison reform work, he’s advised the Ministry of Justice and Theresa May’s policy team at No 10. “I think prevention is better than cure,” he says. “And if you put more investment in people before they end up in prison, you’ve got a better chance to keep them out of prison.” He recalls one occasion, during a parkrun inside prison grounds, when he talked to the chair of Brentford FC, who was there on a visit. “I said to him, I could halve the criminal justice bill for young offenders. And he asked, ‘how would you do it?’. And I said, I’d send all these kids to the best private school in the UK.”The first time he was allowed to leave the country he headed to Lake Annecy, in Haute-Savoie, south-eastern France, to do a training camp with a group of triathletes. It was the first time he’d been to the mountains. “It was the most amazing feeling ever,” he says. “I was free again. That was probably one of the happiest days of my life.”I’d been in such a dark situation and I’ve managed to get myself out of it because I had the will, drive and determination – and also the supportNow, McAvoy has one motivation. “It’s quite simple, actually – it’s helping other people. I know it sounds a bit cheesy, but I’m in a very privileged position now where I’ve come from nothing,” he says. “I’d been in such a dark situation and I’ve managed to get myself out of it because I had the will, drive, determination and the mindset, but then also I had the support and help and that unlocked all of these things.”View image in fullscreenRunning up that hill … McAvoy, left, and Davis at the Ultra-Trail du Mont-Blanc in the French Alps in 2024.Photograph: William HoweIf McAvoy wanted, he could make a decent living as a professional public speaker. Instead, most of his energy is spent working with young people on hisAlpine Run Project– a six-month fitness programme culminating in the famousUltra-Trail du Mont-Blanc run through the French Alps. He set up the project in 2023, with the help of various partners including Nike (which started sponsoring him in 2017 after one of its executives read about his story, and has done so ever since). It was an idea he’d had more than seven years ago: taking underprivileged kids from inner cities out on trail runs and exposing them to opportunities and Olympic athletes. He wanted them to experience a place that profoundly changed him. In the first year, 14 kids took part. This year, more than 500 have been involved. He cycles through the stories of the children he’s come into contact with through the project, and he’s fizzing with excitement as he talks about the impact the programme has had on them, and him.View image in fullscreenHaving an impact … McAvoy at the Alpine Run Project launch event.Photograph: Alpine Run ProjectYou get the sense that he’s trying to be the mentor he lacked when his stepfather came into his life at an impressionable age. “I’ve got no doubt whatsoever, if I had anyone else come into my life – Richard Branson, an Olympic athlete, whoever – when I was that age, my life would have gone down a very different road.”McAvoy’s uncle Micky died in 2023. The last time McAvoy saw his stepfather was in the reception area in Belmarsh in 2002. While being transferred, McAvoy heard his voice and called out his name. They shouted to each other and convinced the police to let them see each other. They opened his stepfather’s cell. “I remember seeing him that day in that reception area in Belmarsh. And he was handcuffed to a prison officer who was half his age,” he says. “It was very weird. Going back to when I was a kid and when I first saw him, then all the years I spent with him and all the things I was doing with him, to then see him in that situation in prison, and the way he just looked really weak. He had lost all his power. And that was the last time I saw him.” Tobin has been in prison ever since.Does McAvoy hold any resentment or blame toward his stepfather? “No,” he says emphatically. “I know it sounds weird … but I was loved. I genuinely was. I wasn’t abused. No one ever made me do anything I didn’t want to do. Did they encourage me? I don’t think they overtly did at the beginning, but I don’t think they realised what they were doing. I think it was quite careless,” he says. “I always made a conscious decision about what I wanted to do and no one ever made me do anything.”As for whether he has any regrets about his past, he says: “I always regret what I did because my behaviour affected other people, but I don’t regret the 10 years I spent in prison because I feel as if I learned so much about myself. And yeah, I would go through that journey again if I had to.”For more information go toAlpine Run ProjectorInstagramExplore more on these topicsSocietyHow we surviveRowing (Sport)Prisons and probationTriathlonRowing (Life and style)UK criminal justiceFitnessfeaturesShareReuse this content"

On Friday, the US defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, said four “narco-terrorists” werekilled in international waters“just off the coast of Venezuela” as they transported “substantial amounts of [US-bound] narcotics”.However, the names of those killed on the supposed “narco-boats” have not been released and Trump officials have failed to provide any proof that the victims were involved in smuggling drugs to the US.The White House pushed back against Petro’s claims,demandinghe publicly retract “his baseless and reprehensible statement” about the boat attack. But two US officials, who were not authorised to discuss the matter publicly,told the New York Timesthat Colombians were on at least one of the boats recently destroyed by the US.Petro urged the White House to release the names of those killed by US strikes “so I can see if my information is unfounded”.Washington claims its strikes – which are part of a major military buildup in the Caribbean Sea – are part of a large-scale crackdown on Venezuelan narco groups it accuses of flooding the US with cocaine.Venezuela on edge over Trump regime change whispers: ‘If it does happen we are ready’Read moreHowever, the decision to deploy warships and thousands of marines off Venezuela’s Caribbean coast has left many observers many wondering if the operation is actually a pretext to depose Venezuela’s authoritarian president, Nicolás Maduro.“The deployment is vastly disproportionate to any real counter-narcotics mission. So this really looks, walks and talks like a regime change preparation,” Juan González, the White House’s former top Latin America official,told CNNthis week.González, who served under Joe Biden, said that by some estimates “roughly 10% of naval assets” had been sent to the region.On Wednesday, Maduro, who Trump failed to topple during his first term, warned that his troops were preparing for a possible attempt at regime change. “If the gringos attack, we will respond.”Venezuela’s defense minister, Vladimir Padrino López, said he was braced for a variety of scenarios including drone attacks, an air campaign or acts of sabotage or targeted assassinations carried out by US special forces.Writing on Wednesday, Petro claimed “the war” playing out in the Caribbean Sea was not about drug smuggling but oil, a commodity of which Venezuela boasts the world’s largest reserves. “The world must stop this,” Petro added. “This aggression is aimed at the whole of Latin America and the Caribbean.”On Thursday, Grenada’s ministry of foreign affairs confirmed it ha​d received a request from the US for the “temporary installation of radar equipment and associated technical personnel”. The confirmation followed days of speculation by local media that the US was going to ask the country to host military assets to help with their operations in the southern Caribbean.While some Caribbean nations, such as Trinidad and Tobago, have welcomed the US’s military presence in the region, others have described it as a threat to peace and security.The Venezuela-backed Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our America trade bloc, of which Grenada is a member, had condemned the US deployment of warships as a “flagrant violation” of international law. In its statement, Grenada said it was carefully reviewing the request and would only make a decision after “technical and legal assessments”.Explore more on these topicsColombiaAmericasVenezuelaUS militarynewsShareReuse this content"

Fernández de Kirchner, Argentina’s vice-president at the time, was unharmed.The botched assassination attempt provoked street protests from Fernández de Kirchner’s diehard supporters as well as scepticism and conspiracy theories from her fervent critics.1:07Man points gun at Argentinian vice-president Cristina Fernández de Kirchner – videoAmong Latin America’s best-known politicians with three decades at the forefront of Argentinian politics and two terms as president from 2007 to 2015, Fernández de Kirchner is a deeply polarising figure whose brand of leftwing populism brought Argentina infamy for its runaway inflation and enormous fiscal deficits.Convicted of corruption for allegedly steering public roadworks contracts to a friend’s company, Fernández de Kirchner, 72,was sentenced earlier this yearto six years in prison.

The war powers resolution would have required the president to seek authorization from Congress before further military strikes on the cartels.TheTrump administrationhas asserted that drug traffickers are armed combatants threatening the United States, creating justification to use military force. But that assertion has been met with some unease on Capitol Hill.SomeRepublicansare asking the White House for more clarification on its legal justification and specifics on how the strikes are conducted, while Democrats insist they are violations of US and international law. It is a clash that could redefine how the world’s most powerful military uses lethal force and set the tone for future global conflict.The White House had indicated Trump would veto the legislation, and even though the Senate vote failed, it gave lawmakers an opportunity to go on the record with their objections to Trump’s declaration that the US is in “armed conflict” with drug cartels.“It sends a message when a significant number of legislators say: ‘Hey, this is a bad idea,’” said SenatorTim Kaine, a Virginia Democrat who pushed the resolution alongside Adam Schiff, a Democrat of California.Wednesday’s vote was brought under the War Powers Resolution of 1973, which was intended to reassert congressional power over the declaration of war.“Congress must not allow the executive branch to become judge, jury and executioner,” Paul, a Kentucky Republican who has long pushed for greater congressional oversight of war powers, said during a floor speech.Paul was the only Republican to publicly speak in favor of the resolution before the vote, but a number of Republican senators have questioned the strikes on vessels and said they are not receiving enough information from the administration.Kevin Cramer, a North Dakota Republican, acknowledged “there may be some concern” in the Republican conference about the strikes. However, Republican leaders stridently argued against the resolution on the Senate floor Wednesday, calling it a political ploy fromDemocrats.“People were attacking our country by bringing in poisonous substances to deposit into our country that would have killed Americans,” said Senator Jim Risch, the chair of the Senate foreign relations committee. “Fortunately most of those drugs are now at the bottom of the ocean.”Risch thanked Trump for his actions and added that he hoped the military strikes would continue.Members of the Senate armed services committee received a classified briefing last week on the strikes, and Cramer said he was “comfortable with at least the plausibility of their legal argument”. But, he added, no one representing intelligence agencies or the military command structure for Central and South America was present for the briefing.“I’d be more comfortable defending the administration if they shared the information,” he said.Kaine also said the briefing did not include any information on why the military chose to destroy the vessels rather than interdict them or get into the specifics of how the military was so confident the vessels were carrying drugs.“Maybe they were engaged in human trafficking, or maybe it was the wrong ship,” Schiff said. “We just have little or no information about who was onboard these ships or what intelligence was used or what the rationale was and how certain we could be that everyone on that ship deserved to die.”US struck another alleged drug boat off Venezuela coast, Trump saysRead moreThe Democrats also said the administration had told them it was adding cartels to a list of organizations deemed “narco-terrorists” that are targets for military strikes, but it had not shown the lawmakers a complete list.“The slow erosion of congressional oversight is not an abstract debate about process,” Jack Reed, the top Democrat on the Senate armed services committee, said in a floor speech. “It is a real and present threat to our democracy.”The secretary of state,Marco Rubio, visited the Republican conference for lunch on Wednesday to emphasize to senators that they should vote against the legislation. He told the senators that the administration was treating cartels like governmental entities because they had seized control of large portions of some Caribbean nations, according to Senator John Hoeven of North Dakota.Rubio told reporters at the Capitol: “These drug-trafficking organizations are a direct threat to the safety and security of the United States to unleash violence and criminality on our streets, fueled by the drugs and the drug profits that they make. … And the president, as the commander in chief, has an obligation to keep our country safe.”Still, Democrats said the recent buildup of US maritime forces in the Caribbean was a sign of shifting US priorities and tactics that could have grave repercussions. They worried that further military strikes could set off a conflict withVenezuelaand argued that Congress should be actively deliberating whenever American troops are sent to war.Schiff said, “This is the kind of thing that leads a country, unexpectedly and unintentionally, into war.”Explore more on these topicsUS SenateDonald TrumpVenezuelaDrugsUS militaryTrump administrationUS CongressnewsShareReuse this content"

It is a significant bet on Hong Kong and China, and comes amid ongoing criticism over Heng Seng’s exposure toChina’s real estate downturn.HSBC, which makes the majority of its profits in Hong Kong andChina, has reportedly been pushing Hang Seng to get rid of bad debts linked to the property market.Its chief executive, Georges Elhedery, who took over last year, said the deal represented a “significant investment into Hong Kong’s economy, underscoring our confidence in this market and commitment to its future as a leading global financial centre, and as a super-connector between international markets and mainland China”.The news comes a year after Elhedery announced a company-wide shake-up that involved massive cost cuts, exiting certain markets, and dividing the bank’s operations into eastern and western markets. The move brieflysparked rumours of a HSBC break-up, which were later quashed.HSBC said that it would not be launching any further share buybacks over the next three quarters in light of the £10bn deal, in order to build up its capital levels – referring to the financial cushion that ensures banks can absorb shocks and protect customers from potential losses. That detail appears to have disappointed shareholders, with HSBC’s London-listed shares falling 5% on Thursday.AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould said: “Like a toddler who has been told they can’t have another biscuit, HSBC shareholders are stamping their feet on news they won’t be getting any share buybacks for the next few quarters.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It added that the amount of Caesium-137 it had detected would not pose an acute hazard to consumers.The FDA said: “The primary health effect of concern following longer term, repeated low dose exposure (eg through consumption of contaminated food or water over time) is an elevated risk of cancer, resulting from damage to DNA within living cells of the body.”Radiation scans revealed at least 22 plants in the industrial zone were contaminated. The Indonesian taskforce did not name the 21 other production facilities, but said they would immediately undergo decontamination procedures conducted by Indonesia’s nuclear agency.The environment minister, Hanif Faisol, said people living in highly contaminated areas would be relocated until the site was decontaminated, adding that the safety of the residents was the “top priority”.Health authorities also conducted checks on local workers and residents living near the industrial estate, identifying nine people who tested positive for exposure to Caesium-137. They were referred to a hospital before being cleared to return home.The contaminated sites will immediately undergo decontamination procedures by Indonesia’s nuclear agency. Authorities have also designated the site of a scrap metal factory, PT Peter Metal Technology, as an isolation facility for contaminated goods.Indonesia, which operates no nuclear power plants or weapons programme, believes that Caesium-137 may have entered the country from overseas.A spokesperson for the taskforce, Bara Hasibuan, told reporters on Wednesday that scrap metal imports were the likely source of contamination and confirmed the government would immediately impose restrictions on scrap metal imports. He said vehicles were also being inspected for potential contamination as they moved through the area.Caesium 137 is a hazardous radioactive isotope that usually enters the environment as a result of nuclear testing or accidents, such as Fukushima or Chornobyl. Small amounts are present in soil, food and air.The level detected in the frozen shrimp was far lower than FDA intervention levels, but the authoritysaidlong-term exposure to even low doses of caesium was linked to an elevated risk of cancer.The recalled shrimp was sold atWalmartstores across at least a dozen US states, including Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Missouri, Mississippi, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Texas and West Virginia.Explore more on these topicsFood safetyIndonesiaFood & drink industryAsia PacificWalmartFoodRetail industrynewsShareReuse this content"

These impacts already undermine access to clean water, food, and safe housing.According to the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), at least 50,000 Pacific Islanders each year face the risk of displacement from climate impacts such as sea level rise and extreme weather. More than half of the Pacific Islands’ population live within 500 metres of the coast, the WMO said, where sea levels are rising faster than the global average and driving pressures for climate-induced migration.A climate crisis, a ballot, and a chance at a new life in AustraliaRead moreThere are some schemes for Pacific migration – namely to New Zealand and Australia – that provide pathways and could be used by those affected by the climate crisis. But experts say current pathways are inadequate and exclude some groups.“Pacific people are already on the move not as victims, but as skilled workers seeking stability and opportunity,” Tupai Fotu Jackson, a Pacific climate and labour mobility expert from New Zealand, said.“We need a humanitarian visa pathway that recognises climate displacement not as a crisis of desperation, but as a reality that demands planning, dignity, and partnership.”Dr Satyendra Prasad, the former Fiji ambassador to the UN and senior fellow in climate and sustainability at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said New Zealand should create a “pathway to full residency for Pacific Islanders” working under labour migration schemes.Prasad said he hoped the report would “ignite energy and action within New Zealand to create a visa category for Pacific Islanders facing displacement as a consequence of climate change”.Any migration pathway should complement, not replace, urgent climate action and support for in-place adaptation, the report said.About 320,000 people in the Pacific were displaced by disasters between 2008 and 2017, according to the International Organisation for Migration. Nasa projects sea levels could rise by up to 15cmover the next 30 years.“Experiencing and seeing what is happening in the islands, if there was some sort of ‘refugee visas’ for us, I would definitely go for that visa,” said Tealofi, a 47-year-old Tuvaluan man quoted in the report.“You experience and see the bad impacts we see from climate change, especially in those days when you see the impacts of king tides and all the damages it provokes, why would I not want to apply for international protection?” he said.New Zealand’s immigration minister, Erica Stanford, would not comment on whether New Zealand would consider establishing a humanitarian visa because she had not yet seen Amnesty’s report.Nearly 9% of New Zealand’s population identify with a Pacific background, the report said. Most are Samoan, followed by Tongan and Cook Islands Māori.In 2017, the then New Zealand prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, proposed a humanitarian visa for 100 Pacific Islanders annually displaced by climate breakdown. The plan never eventuated, leaving advocates frustrated by the lack of progress.New Zealand’s Pacific Access Category, which uses a lottery system and strict health requirements, excludes older people, those with disabilities, and others most vulnerable to climate impacts. Between 2010 and 2024, at least 26 applications were declined due to health-related requirements, forcing families to leave behind members with disabilities.Tuvalu’srecent agreement with Australia, the Falepili Union treaty, offers a rare example of a legally binding framework addressing statehood and mobility in the face of rising seas. Tuvalu’s prime minister, Feleti Teo,told the Guardian in June“Australia is now the first country to legally recognise the continuity of our statehood despite climate change and sea level rise”.He said while these principles have gained traction through Pacific and UN declarations, “the ultimate objective is to develop a treaty under international law that enshrines these principles.”Explore more on these topicsPacific islandsTuvaluKiribatiAsia PacificClimate crisisNew ZealandnewsShareReuse this content"

The defence minister, Richard Marles, was a key architect of the factional deal.The former Bill Shorten staffer Steve Michelson, who lives in the area, is expected to contest the seat for the right.But some party sources have pointed to thenational secretary, Paul Erickson, as a potential candidate, noting that if he chose to run, no serious opposition would be expected. Erickson is a member of the left.“If he wants it, it’s his,” one said.Another party figure said Erickson was the most powerful person in the AustralianLabor partyafter the prime minister, Anthony Albanese – who is also in the left faction – having engineered two election victories, but expressed doubt he would be interested in running for Isaacs.Asked about his future immediately after the election, Erickson said he would decide whether to seek another term as the party’s national secretary before the end of 2025.View image in fullscreenALP national secretary Paul Erickson is seen by some as a potential candidate for the seat of Isaacs.Photograph: Lukas Coch/AAPDreyfus, who turned 69 this month, has not given any indication of his plans, keeping silent about his treatment in the post-election reshuffle and his future in parliament.A Victorian Labor source aligned with the MP said it was “absolutely wishful thinking – from both factions – that Mark is actually going anywhere”.The carving up of federal electorates as part of cross-factional deals is not without precedent in the Labor party.

Thank you to the security services,” the defence minister, Theo Francken, said on social media.According to reports, police searched a residence just a few hundred metres from De Wever’s home in the city.“During a search of one suspect’s home, an improvised device – potentially explosive but not yet operational – was found, along with a bag containing metal pellets,” Fransen said.At the home of a second suspect, police discovered a 3D printer “believed to have been intended for manufacturing components useful in carrying out an attack”, she added.The suspects were born in 2001, 2002 and 2007.Two of them were being questioned by federal police and were due to appear before an investigating judge on Friday.The third suspect was released.Explore more on these topicsBelgiumEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

But scientists have revealed a more savage side, after witnessing a greater noctule bat – Europe’s largest bat species – hunting, killing and devouring a robin mid-flight.The grisly recording reveals the bat as a formidable predator, climbing to 1.2km (4,000ft) before embarking on a breakneck-speed dive in pursuit of its prey. On capture, the bat delivered a lethal bite and subsequent chewing sounds, recorded between echolocation calls, indicated that the bat consumed the bird continuously during flight for 23 minutes without losing altitude.“It’s fascinating that bats are not only able to catch them, but also to kill and eat them while flying,” said Dr Laura Stidsholt, a co-author of the research based at Aarhus University. “A bird like that weighs about half as much as the bat itself – it would be like me catching and eating a 35-kilo animal while jogging.”Billions of birds seasonally migrate at night and over long distances at high altitude and their flight paths are known to intersect with bat hunting grounds. Dr Carlos Ibáñez, of the Doñana Biological Station, Seville, first made the case that birds were an important food resource during the pre-hibernation – autumn – and gestation – spring – periods after observing feathers in bat faeces 25 years ago. Other scientists were sceptical, however, and in the intervening years Ibáñez and colleagues have deployed surveillance cameras, military radar and ultrasound recorders attached to hot air balloons in a quest for smoking gun evidence.In the latest study, greater noctule bats were taken from nesting boxes in southernSpainand fitted with tiny “backpacks” containing instruments to record acceleration, altitude and audio, including echolocation calls. The data revealed two instances of bats mounting attacks on migratory birds, one of which was successful.This bat was observed to climb to an altitude of 1.2km, before encountering its prey. “The bat is flying in stealth mode,” said Stidsholt. “It’s night-time, the bird can’t see it coming, it can’t hear the echolocation sounds. The bat has an advantage.”On close approach – perhaps alerted by the bat’s wingbeats or its shadow – the bird suddenly entered a downward spiral. The bat was observed to follow in a cat-and-mouse chase covering more than 1km, during which the microphone recorded 21 distress calls from the robin. As the pair approached ground level, a final shriek was heard from the robin, followed by 23 minutes of chewing sounds from the bat as it continued to fly at low altitude.“From a human perspective, I didn’t feel good about it,” said Stidsholt. “But, on the other hand, the bat is a very rare species and it isn’t doing very well in southern Europe due to droughts and wild fires so we want this species to have a good meal.”Previously, Ibáñez had collected, and stored in a freezer, severed songbird wings found under bats’ hunting grounds. X-ray imaging and DNA analysis of 11 wings suggested that the bats bite off and discard the wings – probably to reduce weight and drag. The researchers believe that the bats then stretch the membrane between their hind legs forward like a pouch, allowing them to eat the rest of the bird mid-flight.Elena Tena, of Doñana Biological Station and a lead author of the study, said: “While it evokes empathy for the prey, it is part of nature.”The findings are published in the journalScience.Explore more on these topicsAnimal behaviourBiologySpainEuropeWildlifeMammalsBirdsnewsShareReuse this content"

Several of his works, including his novels Satantango and The Melancholy of Resistance, have been adapted into feature films.“I am deeply glad that I have received the Nobel prize – above all because this award proves that literature exists in itself, beyond various non-literary expectations, and that it is still being read,” said Krasznahorkai. “And for those who read it, it offers a certain hope that beauty, nobility, and the sublime still exist for their own sake. It may offer hope even to those in whom life itself only barely flickers.”The novelist Colm Tóibín described Krasznahorkai as “a unique literary visionary who has opened up a huge amount of rich space in the contemporary novel showing what can be done”.“Krasznahorkai richly deserves the prize,” said the novelist Hari Kunzru. “He has a reputation as an austere figure of European high culture, and indeed some of his work is uncompromisingly bleak and difficult, but he’s also a curious, playful and very funny writer. When I read him, I feel fortified, both as a human being and as someone who’s trying to make art. He shows me what’s possible.”Born in Gyula, Hungary, in 1954, Krasznahorkai first made his mark with his 1985 debut novelSatantango, a mesmerising portrayal of a collapsing rural community. The novel would go on towin the Man Booker International prizein English three decades later, in 2015. It was also famously adapted intoa seven-hour filmby directorBéla Tarr, with whom Krasznahorkai has had a long creative partnership.Often described as postmodern, Krasznahorkai is known for his long, winding sentences (the 12 chapters of Satantango each consist of a single paragraph) and the kind of relentless intensity that has led critics to compare him to Gogol, Melville and Kafka.“Krasznahorkai is a great epic writer in the central European tradition that extends through Kafka to Thomas Bernhard, and is characterised by absurdism and grotesque excess,” said Anders Olsson, chair of the Nobel committee.He described Krasznahorkai’s prose as having “developed towards … flowing syntax with long, winding sentences devoid of full stops that has become his signature.”Susan Sontag has described the author as “the contemporary Hungarian master of apocalypse”, while WG Sebald praised the universality of his vision. Only a few of Krasznahorkai’s works have been translated into English. The literary critic James Wood once wrote that his books “get passed around like rare currency”.Krasznahorkai’s career has been shaped by travel as much as by language. He first left communistHungaryin 1987, spending a year in West Berlin for a fellowship, and later drew inspiration from east Asia – particularly Mongolia and China – for works such as The Prisoner of Urga, and Destruction and Sorrow Beneath the Heavens.While working on War and War, he travelled widely across Europe and lived for a time in Allen Ginsberg’s New York apartment, describing the legendary Beat poet’s support as crucial to completing the novel.Asked how he would describe his work in aninterview with the Guardianin 2015, Krasznahorkai said: “Letters; then from letters, words; then from these words, some short sentences; then more sentences that are longer, and in the main very long sentences, for the duration of 35 years. Beauty in language. Fun in hell.”On people discovering his work for the first time, he added: “If there are readers who haven’t read my books, I couldn’t recommend anything to read to them; instead, I’d advise them to go out, sit down somewhere, perhaps by the side of a brook, with nothing to do, nothing to think about, just remaining in silence like stones. They will eventually meet someone who has already read my books.”Before the announcement, Ladbrokes had listed Can Xue, the avant garde Chinese writer, and Krasznahorkai asjoint favourites for this year’s prize.The Nobel prize in literature has been awarded on 117 previous occasions since 1901. Recent laureates include Annie Ernaux, Bob Dylan, Abdulrazak Gurnah, Louise Glück, Peter Handke and Olga Tokarczuk. Last year’s recipient was Han Kang, the South Korean author best known for The Vegetarian.Krasznahorkai will formally receive the medal and diploma in a ceremony in Stockholm in December.“Krasznahorkai reminds us life is difficult, agency almost always out of reach, and the colours of many times and places sombre,” said the poet and writer Fiona Sampson in response to his win. His work, she says, is “an essential read for these times, not least in a Europe once again feeling the squeeze between Russia and the US”.To explore all books by László Krasznahorkai, visitguardianbookshop.com.

The court heard Dogan, a married father, made contact with Gisèle Pelicot’s then husband, Dominique Pelicot, in an online chatroom called “without her knowledge”, where Pelicot was looking for men to come to his home to rape his wife after he had drugged her into a comatose state.Gisèle Pelicot’s lawyer, Antoine Camus, had told the court: “We hope the jury will say loud and clear that in this country, human rights are also women’s rights – that consent is personal, not delegated. Consent is obtained directly and not by proxy from a husband.”Dominique Pelicot, one of the worst sex offenders in modern French history, wassentenced to 20 years in prisonlast year for drugging his then wife and inviting dozens of men to rape her in her home in the Provence village of Mazan over a period of almost a decade of their marriage.Fifty other men were foundguiltyin a high-profile trial last year, and Dogan was the only man to appeal against his conviction. He was initially sentenced to nine years in prison, a sentence raised on Thursday to 10 years. The lead state prosecutor, Dominique Sie, had argued he should serve 12 years, because he “absolutely refuses to take any responsibility”.Dogan had first sent Dominique Pelicot sexually explicit photos and then driven an hour from his village in Provence to rape Gisèle Pelicot, after telling his wife he was going out, the court heard.View image in fullscreenGisèle Pelicot and her son, Florian Pelicot, leaves court after the verdict.Photograph: Christophe Simon/AFP/Getty ImagesPelicot, who was brought from solitary confinement in prison to brieflygive evidenceat the appeal trial, told the court that Dogan had known his wife had been was “sedated” and he said to men by phone: “I’m looking for someone to abuse my wife after I’ve put her to sleep without her knowledge.”The courtroom became a focus point for a broader debate on rape culture in society as Dogan continued to say he was innocent and had not committed rape, arguing that because Gisèle Pelicot’s husband had invited him into the bedroom, his actions had been acceptable.The jury in the Nîmes appeals court was shown video evidence of Gisèle Pelicot’s limp body, unconscious and snoring in a comatose state, while a smiling Dogan committed rape repeatedly over a timeframe of what police said was three and a half hours. The presiding judge said she had been at risk of death by suffocation. The state prosecution said there was no doubt that she had been unconscious and had not consented.Dogan told the court the videos were simply “sex scenes” and denied it was rape. He said what he did was “a sexual act”, not rape. He told the court: “I never raped.” He said Gisèle Pelicot’s husband had invited him to the house, and therefore it was OK. He said he was manipulated by Dominique Pelicot. “I wanted to stop,” Dogan told the court. “I continued because he reassured me.”Asked if he wanted to make a final statement to the court, Dogan said: “I never wanted to harm that lady.”Gisèle Pelicot, who was applauded upon leaving court each day by crowds gathered to support her, told Dogan in court: “You haven’t understood. When are you going to recognise you raped me? It’s a crime to rape an unconscious woman. When did I ever give you consent? Never.”Gisèle Pelicot, 72, became an international feminist hero after she waived her right to anonymity in the trial last year when she said: “Shame must change sides.”Sie, turning to Gisèle Pelicot in court, said Dogan’s refusal to take responsibility showed that: “Shame has not yet changed sides. Society is maybe in the process of that, perhaps driven by the collective awareness brought by the exposure of your case.”Sie said Dogan’s claims of innocence showed how rape culture was still widespread in society as part of “archaic” forms of “male domination”. He said: “Now we must change rape culture to a culture of consent.”Sie told Dogan: “As long as you refuse to admit it, it’s not just a woman, it’s an entire sordid social system that you are endorsing.”Dogan was born in Turkey and at the age of five came toFrance, where his father worked as a concierge. The court heard that his father was violent and that Dogan began smoking cannabis at the age of 10. When Dogan was 17 he was stopped by police for dealing drugs and his father kicked him out of home. He served time in prison for drug dealing in his early 20s and had worked as a builder but had experienced periods of homelessness.He was married and had a son with Down’s syndrome, for whom he was the principal carer as his wife worked in a school canteen. The court heard his wife did not know he had regular sexual encounters outside their marriage. His defence said this was his way of coping with his stressful life. Dogan had told a court psychologist that once a year he sought paid sex on his birthday. His lawyers told the court he had arthritis triggered by the stress of the first trial.Explore more on these topicsGisèle PelicotGisèle Pelicot rape trialFranceRape and sexual assaultEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

When the president is this volatile and authoritarian, of course we have to be prepared for anything,” Bergstø told the Guardian.“The Nobel Committee is an independent body and the Norwegian government has no involvement in determining the prizes. But I’m not sure Trump knows that. We have to be prepared for anything from him.”Trump has long been outspoken about his belief that he should be awarded the peace prize, an honourpreviously bestowed on one of his presidential predecessors, Barack Obama, in 2009 for his “extraordinary efforts to strengthen international diplomacy and cooperation between peoples”.In July, Trump reportedly called Jens Stoltenberg, Norway’s finance minister and the former Nato secretary general, to ask about the Nobel prize. At the UN last month, Trump falsely claimed that he had halted seven “unendable wars”, telling world leaders: “Everyone says I should get the Nobel peace prize.”6:07Fact-checking Donald Trump’s false and misleading claims during his UN address – videoArild Hermstad, the leader of the Green party of Norway, said the Nobel committee’s independence is what gives the prize its credibility.“Peace prizes are earned through sustained commitment, not through social media tantrums and not from intimidation,” he said. “It’s good that Trump supported the recent ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas. Any step toward ending the suffering in Gaza is welcome. But one late contribution does not erase years of enabling violence and division.”Kristian Berg Harpviken, the director of the Norwegian Nobel Institute, said the decision was finalised at the most recent meeting of the Nobel committee on Monday.Harpviken said decisions were apolitical, although the appointing of committee members by the Norwegian parliament in accordance with the will of Alfred Nobel, who bequeathed the money to fund the prizes that bear his name, may complicate that impression.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst ThingFree daily newsletterOur US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But Alfred Nobel made it somewhat difficult for us by writing in his will that it must be appointed by the parliament. That, unfortunately, is non-negotiable,” he said.The newspaper columnist and analyst Harald Stanghelle speculated that retribution from Trump – if it were to come – could take the form of tariffs, demands for higher Nato contributions or even declaring Norway an enemy.“He [Trump] is so unpredictable. I don’t want to use the word ‘fear’ but there is a feeling that it could be a challenging situation,” he said. “It’s very very difficult to explain to Donald Trump or to many other countries in the world that it is a totally independent committee because they do not respect this kind of independence.”He said if Trump were to win, it would be the “biggest surprise in the history of the Nobel peace prize”.Nina Græger, the director of the Peace Research Institute Osl, believes the most likely candidates to win this year’s peace prize include Sudan’s Emergency Response Rooms, the Committee to Protect Journalists and the Women’s International League for Peace and Freedom.“While he [Trump] clearly deserves credit for his efforts to end the war in Gaza, it is still too early to tell whether the peace proposal will be implemented and lead to lasting peace,” Græger said.“Trump’s retreat from international institutions, and his wish to take over Greenland from The Kingdom of Denmark, a Nato ally, as well as infringements on basic democratic rights within his own country, do not align well with Nobel’s will.”Explore more on these topicsNobel peace prizeNorwayDonald TrumpEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Many expressed the fear that the new deal would collapse, bringing more suffering to the devastated territory. Though crowds gathered in some places to dance and sing, in many places witnesses reported muted reaction amid loud overflights by warplanes and drones.InIsrael, on a day of fast-moving and sometimes chaotic developments, hospitals readied to receive hostages to be released by Hamas, the ruling coalition government signed off on the new ceasefire deal and thousands took to the streets of Tel Aviv to express joy and relief.Late on Thursday evening, a statement from the government said it had “just approved the framework for the release of all the hostages – both the living and the deceased”.Donald Trump’s announcement of his“peace proposal”last week triggered a frantic round of indirect negotiations between Hamas and Israel in the Egyptian Red Sea resort of Sharm-el Sheikh.The US president said on Thursday he would try to go to Egypt for the signing of the new deal. In Israel, officials suggested that the US president was expected to visit there on Sunday.Trump added that 48 hostages held byHamas, of whom less than half are thought to be still alive, would be released on “Monday or Tuesday” and said that the deal had “ended the war in Gaza”.2:46Netanyahu thanks Trump, Kushner and Witkoff after Israel approves hostage release deal – videoIt was announced on Thursday night that the US wouldsend about 200 troops to Israelto help support and monitor Gaza ceasefire deal.World leaders scrambled to welcome the breakthrough, even if most of Trump’s broader “peace proposal” has yet to be negotiated or even explicitly acknowledged by Hamas and Israel. The US president told reporters in the Oval Office that nobody would be forced to leave Gaza under the terms of the deal. “No, it’s just the opposite,” he said. “This is a great plan.”There was some confusion during Thursday on the timing of the first phase of the deal – reflecting the general uncertainty about many of its main principles.The office of Israel’s prime minister,Benjamin Netanyahu, said the ceasefire would take effect once the agreement was ratified by his government. But an Israeli government spokesperson said the ceasefire would go into force within 24 hours of the cabinet meeting. Those hostages believed to still be alive inGazawould then be freed within 72 hours, they said.Israel’s forces would withdraw to an agreed line in the Gaza Strip that would leave them in control of 53% of the territory, a spokesperson for the Israeli government said.In exchange, Israel will free about 2,000 Palestinian prisoners, but the spokesperson said Marwan Barghouti, a senior figure in Mahmoud Abbas’s Fatah movement who is hugely popular in the West Bank and Gaza and has frequently been talked of as a future leader, would not be among them. Hamas sources said the list of released prisoners was still being discussed late on Thursday.Hamas called on Trump and guarantor states to ensure Israel fully implemented the ceasefire.The exiled Gaza chief Khalil Al-Hayya said on Thursday the group has received guarantees from the United States, Arab mediators and Turkey that the war on Gaza has permanently ended, according to Reuters.UN agencies said they were ready to rush aid into Gaza, where afamine was declared by experts in August.António Guterres, the UN secretary-general, said “to turn this ceasefire into real progress, we need more than the silencing of the guns”.Guterres called for safe access for humanitarian workers, the removal of bureaucratic obstacles to swift delivery of aid, the rebuilding of Gaza’s shattered infrastructure and funding to meet the immense needs.View image in fullscreenA man and a woman embrace in Tel Aviv.Photograph: Maya Levin/AFP/Getty ImagesIn Israel, thousands of people filled a square in Tel Aviv that has become a focus of the campaign to bring home the hostages. Many sang and danced as they waved Israeli and American flags.“It feels like we can finally see a bit of light at the end of the tunnel we have all been walking through,” said Einav Kahila, a 25-year-old student who travelled from Jerusalem. “There’s a lot of anxiety, also, because we’re always feeling unsure or insecure about the situation. But the people that came here today chose to be on the side of optimism.”Einav Zaugauker rejoiced at the prospect of freedom for her son Matan, one of the last hostages.“I can’t breathe, I can’t breathe, I can’t explain what I’m feeling … it’s crazy,” she said.In Gaza, Ola Al-Nazli, 47, said she had learned of the ceasefire from her neighbours in al-Muwasi, a crowded and squalid coastal strip where hundreds of thousands of Palestinians displaced by successive Israeli offensives have sought shelter.“I did not know how to feel, whether to be happy or sad. We have experienced this many times before, and each time we were disappointed again, so this time fear and caution are stronger than ever,” said al Nazli, who was forced to leave her home in Gaza City by the recent Israeli offensive there.“Everyone lives in tents that do not protect from the cold or from the bombing. Those who had money or work lost everything. That is why our happiness is incomplete, mixed with pain … I only hope that we can live in safety, not hear the sound of bombs again, not be forced to move from one place to another, and that the crossings [into Gaza from Israel] will open soon.”Successful completion of the deal would mark the biggest foreign policy achievement so far for Trump, who took office in January promising to quickly end the wars in Gaza and Ukraine, only to be confronted with obstacles and complexities he had apparently not foreseen.Senior envoys from the US, Qatar and Turkey had joined the talks in the Egyptian Red Sea resort of Sharm-el-Sheikh this week, apparently adding momentum to discussions launched on Monday. Trump sent his son-in-law Jared Kushner and the special envoy Steve Witkoff. Both were reported to have arrived in Israel on Thursday night.Map of Gaza Strip highlighting Israeli troop withdrawalsNegotiators have closed gaps between Hamas and Israel over the details of the first phase of the 20-pointplan announced by Trump, but it is unclear whether the parties had even discussed thornier questions, such as how Hamas will be disarmed, as Israel has demanded, and the eventual governance of Gaza.Senior Hamas official Osama Hamdan on Thursday told Qatar-based broadcaster Al Araby the Palestinian militant group rejects Trump’s proposal for an interim “Board of Peace” to oversee Gaza’s administration, headed by the US president himself.Though huge challenges remain, the agreement nonetheless brings the two sides closer than any previous effort to halt a war that evolved into a regional conflict, drawing in countries such as Iran, Yemen and Lebanon, and reshaping the Middle East.In recent days, Israel reduced the intensity of its military campaign. Gaza medical authorities reported eight people were killed in Israeli strikes on Wednesday. Even if aid surges in, through the UN and the Red Crescent as specified under Trump’s plan, hundreds of thousands will stillnot have enough foodor shelter.About 1,200, mostly civilians, were killed in the Hamas attacks of October 2023 and 251 taken hostage. Israel’s retaliatory offensive has killed more than 67,000, mostly civilians, and reduced much of Gaza to rubble.Agence France-Presse, the Associated Press and Reuters contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warPalestineHamasIsraelMiddle East and north AfricaDonald TrumpBenjamin NetanyahunewsShareReuse this content"

The news of theimminent ceasefirehad spread rapidly across the devastated territory during the night, with a few gunshots fired into the sky in celebration, but as morning came the mood was of tense anticipation.“Everyone is still afraid,” said a 26-year-old woman in al-Mawasi, the squalid, overcrowded coastal strip where much of the population has sought shelter in makeshift tents and plastic shacks.Nearby, Abbas Hassouna, 64, said he and his family were “waiting for an official announcement and real guarantees for opening the crossings, bringing in food, and stopping the killing, destruction and displacement”.“When we see these things happen, only then will we truly believe them. But for now, fear remains. They could backtrack at any moment or break the agreement as before and we will remain in the same endless cycle with nothing changing except more suffering,” said Hassouna, who is from northernGazabut has been displaced several times.Ola al-Nazli, 47, said she had learned of the ceasefire from her neighbours in al-Mawasi. “I did not know how to feel, whether to be happy or sad. We have experienced this many times before, and each time we were disappointed again, so this time fear and caution are stronger than ever,” said Nazli, who was forced to leave her home in Gaza City bythe recent Israeli offensive there.“Everyone lives in tents that do not protect from the cold or from the bombing. Those who had money or work lost everything. That is why our happiness is mixed with pain and fear. I only hope that we can live in safety, not hear the sound of bombs again, not be forced to move from one place to another, and that the crossings will open soon,” said Nazli.Aid agencies said they were preparing to “flood” Gaza with food and other essential supplies.The 20-point plan proposed by Donald Trumpprovides for a surge of humanitarian assistance. The World Health Organization chief, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said his agency was prepared to “scale up its work to meet the dire health needs of patients across Gaza, and to support rehabilitation of the destroyed health system”.View image in fullscreenUnrwa said it had enough food stockpiled to provide for Gaza’s population for three months.Photograph: Ramadan Abed/ReutersThe UN agency for Palestinian refugees, Unrwa, welcomed the deal as a “huge relief”, and said it had enough food stockpiled outside Gaza to provide for the devastated territory’s 2.3m population for the coming three months. Though more aid has reached Gaza in recent weeks, quantities are still grossly insufficient, humanitarian workers said.Jihad al-Hilu heard the news of the ceasefire on a radio while sitting in his tent in al-Mawasi. “At that moment, I felt a mix of joy and relief, as if some hope had returned to my heart after a long wait. We were longing for this moment, for the blood to stop and for the massacres that have broken so many homes to end,” Hilu, 33, told the Guardian.“At the same time, there is a great fear that lives within us. We worry that this truce might be temporary and that the war could return as it did before.”There are also widespread concerns about what peace may bring to Gaza, where more than 90% of homes have been damaged or destroyed, almost all infrastructure destroyed and where much of the population goes hungry every day. More than 67,000 Palestinians, mostly civilians, have been killed by the Israeli offensive launched in the aftermath of the Hamas raid in October 2023, which killed 1,200, also mostly civilians, and saw 251 taken hostage by militants.“What worries me more than anything is the lack of security. Hunger can be endured, but the absence of safety is the real disaster. I fear that Gaza could turn into a place of chaos ruled by gangs and militias instead of law and order,” Hilu said.Witnesses said Israeli forces fired tank shells to prevent Palestinians returning to northern parts of Gaza on Thursday morning but reported no sounds of fighting or airstrikes.Nadra Hamadeh, whose sister, brother-in-law, two nieces and son in law were killed in the war, said she hoped to return from al-Mawasi to northern Gaza as soon as possible to check on her home, which she believes to be damaged but not destroyed.“My heart is heavy for those who lost their families and children and homes … As for us, we look forward to returning to our home that we had to leave behind. It feels still as if our souls were taken from our bodies when we left,” Hamadeh, 57, said.“Our hope is that the war ends, Gaza will be rebuilt with its people and residents, and families will be reunited … I only ask that the people return to their homes as they were before this two-year war and that Gaza recovers and is returned to its people.”Explore more on these topicsGazaPalestineIsrael-Gaza warMiddle East and north AfricaIsraelnewsShareReuse this content"

In more than half of the cases reviewed, unsupervised overnight contact was ordered.“No child should be forced to spend time with an abusive parent or caregiver if the circumstances aren’t safe for them to do so,” Jacobs said. “But time and time again we see how the pro-contact culture and antiquated views on domestic abuse are contributing to decisions that put children in harm’s way.“It’s clear that domestic abuse can no longer be considered a side issue within the family justice system, but instead its everyday business that demands a rigorous response.”Academics from Loughborough University examined 298 files from three courts and observed nearly 100 court hearings. As well as discovering evidence of abuse in case files, the team also heard claims of abuse in 73% of observed hearings, the report said.Survivors repeatedly described how they were dissuaded from raising allegations of domestic abuse due to the suggestion that it would have “no impact” on whether the abusive parent would be granted contact. Others said they felt that pressure had been put on them to accept potentially unsafe child arrangement orders out of fear that, if they contested, an even worse outcome would be granted.Jacobs said survivors were being forced to navigate the complex system without representation. She urged the Ministry of Justice to commit to a rollout of the multi-service Pathfinder courts to resolve problems between parents sooner, and place more emphasis on hearing children’s voices.“The government must also provide the necessary investment to extend the pilot study, conducted by my office, to allow for rigorous oversight on the changes being made and ensure accountability from within the family court,” she added. “Tinkering around the edges will no longer suffice.”The report highlights how outdated views on domestic abuse among some legal professionals saw physical violence taken more seriously, while coercive and controlling behaviour – which often underpins physical abuse and is an offence in itself – was frequently dismissed.Areport by Women’s Aidthis summer detailed how 19 children had been killed over nine years by adults who had been allowed contact with them despite a history of violence.In March, MPs discussed the presumption of parental involvement, and heard from Claire Throssell, whose two sons, Jack and Paul, weremurdered by their abusive fatherin during court-ordered unsupervised contact.On Tuesday Catherine Roper, the chief constable of Wiltshire police, apologised after a staff member’s failure to properly undertake applications under Clare’s law – which allows people to find out whether a partner has a history of violence or domestic abuse – left women at risk of violence, including one who was the victim of attempted murder.Explore more on these topicsDomestic violenceViolence against women and girlsChildrennewsShareReuse this content"

The arrest came within 24 hours of the man being released from custody, where he had been held since the attack at Heaton Park synagogue on Yom Kippur last Thursday.In a statement, Counter Terrorism Policing North West said it did not believe there was any continuing threat to the public after last week’s incident, which led to the deaths of two worshippers.Jihad Al-Shamie, a Syrian-born UK citizen, was shot dead by police after ramming his car into congregants before attacking others with a knife while wearing a fake suicide belt.Shamie, 35, called 999 and pledged allegiance to the extremist group Islamic State while attempting to storm the synagogue, shouting: “This is what you’re going to get for killing our children.”Melvin Cravitz, a 66-year-old father of three, was killed along with Adrian Daulby, 53, who is believed to have been inadvertently shot by police as he ran to block the synagogue doors to stop Shamie getting inside.Three men and a woman were initially arrested by counter-terror police last week on suspicion of the commission, preparation and instigation of acts of terrorism. All four were released on Wednesday night.However, police said one of those men was then rearrested at 12.34pm on Thursday at Manchester airport on suspicion of failing to disclose information to officers.The man was held under section 38B of the Terrorism Act 2000, which makes it an offence to withhold information that could prevent a terrorist act or that could lead to a prosecution under terror laws. He had since been released on conditional bail, police said.Explore more on these topicsUK newsnewsShareReuse this content"

They add to hisrolesas a senior adviser to Goldman Sachs International, the investment bank, and speechmaker to investment firms including Bain Capital and Makena Capital in the US, which have netted him over £150,000 a talk.Sunak was prime minister from October 2022 to July 2024, and he joins the $3.9tn technology company Microsoft afterapplaudingit when he was in office as “one of the founding fathers of modern technology”.He follows Nick Clegg, the former Liberal Democrat deputy prime minister, in becoming a paid adviser to one of the Silicon Valley giants. Clegg was president of global affairs for Meta, which operates Instagram and Facebook. Sunak’s senior political adviser, Liam Booth-Smith, also took a role with Anthropic, itemergedin June.The former Conservative leaderunveileda £2.5bn deal with Microsoft’s chief executive, Brad Smith, at the Bletchley Park AI summit in November 2023, in which Microsoft announced what Sunak called a “historic” investment in new datacentres. He also held one-to-one meetings with Bill Gates, the co-founder of Microsoft, which committed another £22bn in UK investment last month and with figures from OpenAI, the startup behind ChatGPT, in which Microsoft is a major investor.Microsoft also has several large contracts with government departments, including the newest memorandum of understanding “representing a yearly spend of £1.4bn to deliver digital transformation, adoption of AI and cloud services”,saidAcoba, which approved the appointment on condition of guardrails to prevent conflicts of interest.In 2023, while Sunak was in 10 Downing Street, the government’s competition watchdog angeredMicrosoftwhen it blocked its attempts to buy the Call of Duty maker Activision. The deal went through after it was restructured.The Westminster authorities cited concerns that “there are risks associated with your access to information that may grant Microsoft an unfair advantage”. Sunak said that he will provide “high-level strategic perspectives on macro-economic and geopolitical trends” and will not advise on UK policy matters.He will divert his salary from both jobs into the Richmond Project, a charity which sets out to boost social mobility through numeracy that he founded with his wife, Akshata Murty, earlier this year.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Anthropic’s chief executive, Dario Amodei, earlier this yearpredictedthat AI could eliminate half of all entry-level white-collar jobs within five years.Acobasaidthat while AI was a significant priority when Sunak was PM, including enacting legislation affecting companies in the AI sector, “there is no suggestion any decisions or actions were taken in office in expectation of this role, and the Cabinet Office confirmed it is not aware of any decisions you made that were specific to Anthropic, as opposed to sector wide.”It said, “there is a reasonable concern that your appointment could be seen to offer unfair access and influence within the UK government”, which was heightened “at a time of intense debate and lobbying around the world” on the right approach to regulating the increasingly powerful technology. But Sunak told the committee the role will be internallyoriented and will not involve any lobbying.A spokesperson for Anthropic said it was pleased to welcome Sunak.“He was among the first global leaders to recognize AI’s transformative potential, establishing the world’s first AI Safety Institute and convening the inaugural AI Safety Summit at Bletchley Park,” they said. “His experience will provide valuable strategic perspective as we work to ensure AI benefits humanity. This internally-focused, part-time advisory role fully complies with the conditions of Acoba, and Mr Sunak is donating his entire compensation to the Richmond Project charity.”Sunak said he was “excited to help these two companies, as they address the big strategic questions about how to make tech work for our economies, our security and our society”.“We stand on the edge of a technological revolution whose impacts will be as profound as those of the industrial revolution: and felt more quickly,” he said. “In my role as a senior adviser, I want to help these companies ensure that this shift delivers the improvements in all of our lives that it can.”Microsoft was approached for comment.Explore more on these topicsRishi SunakMicrosoftComputingArtificial intelligence (AI)newsShareReuse this content"

Solitaire Townsend, the co-founder of the Futerra consultancy, said it would lift what is likely to be a difficult summit, at which the world must agree fresh targets on reducing greenhouse gas emissions.“Is Prince William attending Cop a stunt? Yes. But that doesn’t mean it’s a bad idea,” she said. “Cop has long been as much about so-called ‘optics’ as it is negotiations. Prince William’s announcement will likely encourage other leaders to commit, and will have the global media sitting up to attention.“I suspect HRH knows very well that by showing up, he’ll drag millions of eyes to the event. In an era when climate impacts are growing, but media coverage dropping, anything that draws attention should be celebrated.”King Charles has attended previous Cops, but will not be going to this one.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

That led to the profiling verdict and expensive court-ordered overhauls of the agency’s traffic patrol operations and, later, its internal affairs unit.The county says $323m has been spent so far on legal expenditures, a staff that monitors the sheriff’s department’s progress and the agency’s compliance costs. The county has said the total is expected to reach $352m by July 2026.The federal judge presiding over the case expressed concerns about transparency in spending by the sheriff’s office and ordered a review, leading to the blistering report from budget analysts. The report was prepared by budget analysts picked by the case’s monitor.The report concluded 72% of the $226m in spending by the sheriff’s office from February 2014 to late September 2024 was either wrongly attributed or “improperly prorated” to a compliance fund.Budget analysts who reviewed hundreds of employee records over roughly that time period found an average of 70% of all positions funded by compliance money were “inappropriately assigned or only partially related to compliance.”Those expenditures were unrelated to or unnecessary for compliance, lacked appropriate justification or resulted from purposeful misrepresentation by the sheriff’s office, county leaders or both, the budget analysts wrote.Sheriff Jerry Sheridan’s office released a statement saying its attorneys are reviewing the report to identify areas of common concern and any findings it may dispute. Sheridan, who took office this year, is the fourth sheriff to grapple with the case.Raul Piña, a longtime member of a community advisory board created to help improve trust in the sheriff’s office, said the report opens up a broader conversation about the integrity of the sheriff’s office.“You will have to double-check now whenever the agency talks about statistics,” Piña said.Beginning earlier this year, county officials ramped up their criticism of the spending. They said the agency shouldn’t still be under the court’s supervision a dozen years after the verdict and shouldn’t still be paying such hefty bills, including about $30m to those who monitor the agency on behalf of the judge since around 2014.The report criticized Maricopa county and its governing board for a lack of oversight over the spending.Thomas Galvin, chairman of the county’s governing board and a leading critic of the continued court supervision, said the board’s legal counsel is reviewing the report. “The board has confidence in MCSO’s budgeting team and will respond accordingly,” Galvin said.Since the profiling verdict, the sheriff’s office has been criticized for disparate treatment of Hispanic and Black drivers in a series of studies of its traffic stops. The latest study, however, shows significant improvements. The agency’s also dogged by a backlog of internal affairs cases. While the agency has made progress on some fronts and garnered favorable compliance grades in certain areas, it hasn’t yet been deemed fully compliant with the court-ordered overhauls.Explore more on these topicsArizonaUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

The order took effect on Thursday and will remain in place for two weeks.According to reporters present in the courtroom, Perry said she had “seen no credible evidence that there is a danger of a rebellion in the state of Illinois”. On Thursday evening, around the time of Perry’s ruling, about half a dozen guard soldiers were milling around inside the gate at the Ice center in Broadview. A group of about 10 protesters were outside.Illinois governor JB Pritzker said in a statement: “Donald Trump is not a king – and his administration is not above the law.”Quoting the judge, he said: “Today, the court confirmed what we all know: there is no credible evidence of a rebellion in the state of Illinois. And no place for the national guard in the streets of American cities likeChicago.”Chicago mayor Brandon Johnson, who attended the court hearing,calledthe decision a “win for the people of Chicago and the rule of law”. He vowed that the city would “continue to use all of the tools at our disposal to end the Trump administration’s war on Chicago”.Lawyers for the state of Illinois had called the sending of national guard soldiers to the city – which was opposed by Chicago and state political leaders – a constitutional crisis.The government “plowed ahead anyway”, attorney Christopher Wells said. “Now, troops are here.” Chicago and Illinois, run by Democratic elected leaders, say Trump has exceeded his authority and ignored their pleas to keep the national guard off the streets.Eric Hamilton, a justice department lawyer, said the Chicago area was rife with “tragic lawlessness”.“Chicago is seeing a brazen new form of hostility from rioters targeting federal law enforcement,” Hamilton said. “They’re not protesters. There is enough that there is a danger of a rebellion here, which there is.”In handing down her order, Perry assailed the Department of Homeland Security for providing a version of events on the ground that was “simply unreliable”.Lawyers for Illinois and local officials have said the government is exaggerating and misrepresenting the situation in Chicago, which Trump has referred to as a “war zone”.Abigail Jackson, a spokesperson for the White House, said the president had “exercised his lawful authority to protect federal officers and assets” and “will not turn a blind eye to the lawlessness plaguing American cities”. She added that the president and his administration “expect to be vindicated by the court” upon appeal.National guard members from Texas and Illinois arrived this week at a US army reserve center in Elwood, south-west of Chicago. All 500 national guard members are under the US northern command and have been activated for 60 days.Earlier this week, Trump said Johnson and Pritzker should be jailed for failing to protect federal agents during immigration enforcement crackdowns.Two dozen other states with a Democratic attorney general or governor have signed an appeals court filing in support of the legal challenge by California – and also one in the Portland, Oregon, where a similar troop deployment is also being challenged.The nearly 150-year-old Posse Comitatus Act limits the military’s role in enforcing domestic laws. However, Trump has said he would be willing to invoke the Insurrection Act, which allows a president to dispatch active duty military in states that are unable to put down an insurrection or are defying federal law.In a separate ruling on Thursday, the US district judge Sara Ellis issued a preliminary injunction restricting agents’ use of force, including pepper balls, rubber bullets and physical force such as pulling, shoving ortackling against protestersand journalists who don’t pose a serious threat to law enforcement.Ellis’s order covers all of northern Illinois and also requires federal agents to wear “visible identification” such as badges, the subject of heated debate as viral footage has surfaced of masked, plainclothes officers carrying out immigration enforcements in several US cities.Trump previously sent troops to Los Angeles and Washington DC. In Memphis, Tennessee, Paul Young, the city’s mayor, said national guard members would begin patrolling on Friday. Bill Lee, Tennessee’s Republican governor, supports using the troops.The Associated Press contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsChicagoTrump administrationUS politicsDonald TrumpIllinoisnewsShareReuse this content"

We’re pleased with the court’s dismissal and look forward to continuing our work successfully promoting Drake’s music and investing in his career.”A spokesperson forDrakesaid in a statement: “We intend to appeal today’s ruling, and we look forward to the court of appeals reviewing it.”Drake, who is signed to Republic Records, and Lamar, signed to Interscope Records, both operate under the Universal Music Group umbrella but through separate labels. The legal fight began earlier this year when Drake accused UMG of damaging his reputation by distributing and promoting Not Like Us.He claimed the company made secret payments and offered discounted licensing deals to boost the song’s reach, allegedly to harm his brand and reduce his leverage in ongoing contract talks.In March,UMG filedto have the motion dismissed. The label claimed that Drake “lost a rap battle that he provoked and in which he willingly participated”.“Instead of accepting the loss like the unbothered rap artist he often claims to be, he has sued his own record label in a misguided attempt to salve his wounds,” UMG said in its statement. “Plaintiff’s complaint is utterly without merit and should be dismissed with prejudice.”Kendrick Lamar is widely acknowledged to have won last year’s culture-consuming rap beef with Drake, with Not Like Us going on to win five Grammy awards, including record of the year and song of the year.Explore more on these topicsDrakeUniversal MusicKendrick LamarRapHip-hopnewsShareReuse this content"

And there are worrying signs the test may come,” she told an audience at the Milken Institute in Washington.Meanwhile, concerns are increasingly being aired that a stock market bubble has been created byhigh valuations of AI companies, with the Bank of England stating on Wednesday that there is agrowing risk of a “sudden correction” in global markets.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

On Monday, the Pentagon sent out a revised version.How Maga cheerleaders have infiltrated the White House press corpsRead moreOn Wednesday, the Pentagon Press Association, which said it has been “cautious” in communicating about the policy as it worked behind the scenes, said the changes made – including an acknowledgment that signees may not “agree” with the policies – are not sufficient.In particular, the revised policy still prohibits journalists from the “solicitation” of information from Pentagon employees, “such as public advertisements or calls for tips encouraging [Department of War] employees to share non-public [Department of War] information”. Journalists fear that policy could infringe on their ability to seek information about the agency from employees.Donald Trump recently signed an executive order to change the name of the defense department to the Department of War. This would require approval from Congress to become official.“We acknowledge and appreciate that the Pentagon is no longer requiring reporters to express agreement with the new policy as a condition for obtaining press credentials,” the Pentagon Press Association said in a statement. “But the Pentagon is still asking us to affirm in writing our ‘understanding’ of policies that appear designed to stifle a free press and potentially expose us to prosecution for simply doing our jobs.”The Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press (RCFP), which has worked behind the scenes to relax the policies, said the changes do not go far enough.“The fact is we still have concerns with the updated language of the policy and expect that it will pose a significant impediment as journalists weigh with their employers whether or not to sign this revised version,” Gabe Rottman, the RCFP vice-president of policy said.PEN America, an organization that advocates for free expression, also said Thursday that the Pentagon should “revisit” its policies. “National security is strengthened, not threatened, when journalists can investigate and report without fear,” Tim Richardson, PEN America journalism and disinformation program director said.With the exception of CNN, which does not plan to sign the policy, most news organizations have been tight-lipped when asked whether they plan to sign by next week’s deadline or risk losing access to the Pentagon compound.The New York Times said in a statement that it “appreciates the Pentagon’s engagement, but problems remain with the policy and we and other news organizations believe further changes are needed”.A spokesperson for the Atlantic also said it “[continues] to oppose the Pentagon’s proposed press policy”.Pentagon representatives have been steadfast in rebuffing the protests of media organizations.“Access to the Pentagon is a privilege, not a right and the Department is not only legally permitted, but morally obligated to impose reasonable regulations on the exercise of that privilege,” chief spokesperson Sean Parnellsaid in a post on X, denying that journalists will be forced to “clear stories” with the agency before publication.Kingsley Wilson, the Pentagon press secretary,said in her own postthat “reporters would rather clutch their pearls on social media than stop trying to get warfighters and [Department of War] civilians to commit a crime by violating Department-wide policy.”In its statement on Wednesday, the Pentagon Press Association called on the agency to reconsider the policies in the remaining days before journalists are asked to sign them.“Limiting the media’s ability to report on theUS militaryfails to honor the American families who have entrusted their sons and daughters to serve in it, or the taxpayers responsible for giving the department hundreds of billions of dollars a year,” the group said. “The American people deserve to know how their military is being run. They deserve more information from this administration, not less.”Explore more on these topicsUS militaryTrump administrationUS politicsPress regulationPress freedomNewspapers & magazinesNewspapersnewsShareReuse this content"

There is an urgent need for long-term thinking and workforce investment, alongside investment in AI tools, to ensure sustainable and productive employment.”In addition, two-fifths (39%) of leaders said entry-level roles had already been reduced or cut as a result of efficiencies made by using AI tools to conduct research or carry out administrative and briefing tasks.While more than half of respondents said they felt lucky to have started their career before the use of AI became widespread, just over half (53%) also said they believed that the benefits of AI implementation in companies would outweigh the disruption to the workforce.AI is being rapidly adopted by UK businesses, according to the business leaders surveyed, and three-quarters (76%) said they expect new tools to deliver tangible benefits to their organisations within the next 12 months.Businesses said they were mainly investing in AI to improve productivity and efficiency, as well as cutting costs and filling skills gaps.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

That includes the Environmental Protection Agency, the interior and energy departments and others.The analysis comes as Trump wagesbroad attackson climate and energy policiesand on renewable energy. The president’s so-called one big beautiful act, for instance, opened swaths of federal land to drilling and mining and sped the phaseout of renewable energy incentives. The administration has also launched an unprecedentedassault on climate science, including with anenergy department reporton climate change that experts derided as full of misinformation. The report was created to justify the planned overturning of a key legal finding that forms the basis of virtually all US climate regulations.“It is often specific actors coming from specific moneyed interests that are carrying out this disastrous deregulatory agenda,” said Toni Aguilar Rosenthal, report author and senior researcher at the Revolving Door Project.The authors identified 111 employees deemed “fossil fuel insiders and renewable energy opponents”. That includes 43 people who were directly employed by coal, oil or gas companies. Among them are well-known senior officials such as energy secretary Chris Wright, the former CEO of the fracking company Liberty Energy.The list also includes lesser-known administration members. The energy department’s efficiency and renewable energy office – which recentlytold workersto avoid using terms such as “climate change” and “emissions” – for instance, is led by a former fracking executive. And in the White House, one senior policy adviser has heldhigh-ranking positions at big oil firms including Shell.Another 12 Trump officials, the authors found, have ties to fossil fuel-funded rightwing thinktanks. Among them: former employees and fellows of the Texas Public Policy Foundation, a conservative group that hasfought renewable energyand made what it calls “the moral case for fossil fuels”, as well as the anti-environmentalist group Americans for Prosperity (AFP), which isbacked by the fossil fuel mogulsthe Koch brothers.Corinne Clark, crisis communications director at Koch-funded umbrella group Stand Together, called the Guardian’s characterization of AFP as anti-environment “inaccurate and misleading” because it “supports policies that often lead to significant advancements in low-emission technologies” and backs permitting reform for all kinds of energy. The organization haslongfought climatepolicyandlitigation;expertssay it has long sowedclimate doubt.Twenty-nine other Trump officials are former corporate executives from polluting sectors whose business interests are tied up with fossil fuels, such as chemicals, automaking and mining, the report says. Other officials have ties to utility companies that sell fossil fuels or elected officials who have pushed pro-coal, -oil and -gas policies.Reached for comment, White House spokesperson Anna Kelly said: “It’s totally pathetic and transparent that The Guardian is regurgitating a press release from a self-described anti-Trump group and calling them a ‘consumer advocacy nonprofit’ in order to attack White House staff.”Trump hascastigated criticsof his administration andwarned of a crackdownagainst progressive non-profit organizations.Energy department spokesperson Ben Dietderich said: “Unlike the Biden administration, which routinely prioritized the interests of the radical climate lobby at the expense of the American people, President Trump’s administration has consistently put the American people first.”He added that most US energy comes from fossil fuel. “Of course, President Trump is going to recruit professionals who actually understand how the energy industry works,” he said. “Perhaps the Biden administration would have been more successful in lowering energy prices if they hadn’t filled their administration’s energy-related positions with climate alarmists.”An interior department spokesperson, Aubrie Spadie, said: “While it’s clear that this progressive group pushing an entire climate cult program, among other radical policies, would like to see American taxpayer dollars wasted on the Green New Scam, Americans can rest assured that the Trump administration will continue enforcing an energy strategy that solely benefits our country’s success.”The Guardian has contacted the American Petroleum Institute, the top US fossil fuel lobby firm, for comment.The researchers found that 32 employees at the Department of the Interior alone have ties to polluting energy, making it the most compromised federal agency. That includes interior secretary Doug Burgum, the former governor of North Dakota who has long accepted oil funding and been aconduitbetween fossil fuel industry donors and the US president’s campaign. Burgumhimself owns landthat he leases to oil company Continental Resources, the report notes. That firm is run by major Trump donor and ally Harold Hamm, whose business interests Burgum has oftensupported.Fossil fuel donors poured$96minto Trump’s 2025 presidential campaign and affiliated action committees, and contributed $11.8m to Trump’s second inauguration. Since entering office, his administration has not only enshrined pro-fossil fuel policies and rules, but also craftedtax breaksandtariff carveoutsbenefitting the industry.In addition to oil-tied nominees and appointees, the authors identified several Trump administration higher-ups who were appointed or nominated to powerful positions with little or no subject matter expertise.“These people may not be tied to fossil fuels so directly, but their inexperience is dangerous,” said Alan Zibel, a co-author and the research director at Public Citizen, speaking broadly about the administration’s links to fossil fuels interests. “It’s reasonable to think they will be pushovers, or easy marks, for the oil industry’s agenda.”Trump administration spending $625m to revive dying coal industryRead moreTrump’s nominee to lead the Environmental Protection Agency’s office of general counsel, Sean Donahue, for instance, has scant legal experience, having worked in the first Trump administration EPA for three years, then briefly for aregional law firmin Buffalo, New York, and then for a solar energy company.“He has never tried a case to verdict, never taken a deposition, never signed a pleading and never argued a motion,” said thesenator Sheldon Whitehouse in May.Asked forcommentabout Donahue by the publication Inside Climate News in April, Molly Vaseliou, an EPA spokesperson, defended his nomination. ​​“President Trump made a fantastic choice in selecting Sean to lead [the] EPA’s office of general counsel,” she said. “His years of public service to the American people at the federal and state government level is a boon to the agency.”In another example, one White Houseaide working on energy policy, Jarrod Agen, came to the role after working for Mike Pence, the former vice-president, and defense company Lockheed Martin. Agen does not appear to have direct energy industry or policy experience, the report says.In her statement, Kelly of the White House said: “Secretary Wright, Secretary Burgum, and Jarrod Agen are all exceptionally qualified to deliver on the American people’s mandate to ‘drill, baby, drill’ and unleash our nation’s energy potential – which is what President Trump was overwhelmingly elected to implement, even if the Guardian doesn’t like it.”Trump oversaw a massive slew of anti-environmental actions during his first term. During his second term, equipped with rightwing plans like the Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025, he has overseen a far broader and harsher crackdown on climate rules and renewable energy.The current Trump administration has also been completely unabashed about doing the bidding of the oil sector, said Zibel.“There’s no shame,” he said. “They are proud and willing to go out there and tout the fact that they are doing favors for the oil and gas industry, mining industry, the coal industry.”Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationDemocracy and justiceOil and gas companiesFossil fuelsClimate crisisUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Behind them are the bulldozers that shunt them into the waves and beyond, in neat rows, are black wooden fishermen’s huts and fish stalls, where on a good day teenage daughters, wives and retired skippers sell some of the day’s catch.This is the Stade, a Saxon word for “landing place” from where wooden boats have set off since before William the Conqueror arrived in 1066.But a decline in Britain’s fishing industry has hit many coastal communities hard. Hastings, home to one of the UK’s oldest fleets and the largest beach-launched fleet in Europe, is one of the worst hit. The fleet,which had 53 registered boats in 2015, has 18 today,a drop of 66%. Of them, most lie idle, the fishers say.View image in fullscreenPeter White outside his shed. He has been fishing for 52 years“Fishing has nosedived here,” says Peter White, 67, who has fished since he left school at 15. “A lot of people have left. From here all the way up the eastern channel as far as Whitstable. Harbours are empty, boats are gone. Fishing is on the floor. These boats haven’t been at sea for a month.”No one is at sea today, due to westerly winds, which worsen the further out you go, he says, and even on a good day, there’s fewer than eight active.These small “under 10” metre boats are the backbone of the UK industry; they represent79% of the fleetandreportedly providehalf of catch-related jobs. But in England between 2008 and 2022, they declined in numbers by 22%, nearly double the 13% fall in larger boats, according to research by Newcastle University and the University of Plymouthpublished this year.Over the same period, vessels under 10 metres also spent 43% fewer days at sea.The fishers in Hastings who spoke to the Guardian blamed multiple factors for the decline, including marine heatwaves affecting fish populations, unsustainable quotas that dictate what and how much they can fish and larger trawlers further out in the North Sea “hammering” fish stocks.View image in fullscreenTraditional small fishing boats pulled up above the high-tide line on the Stade in Hastings in 2021In White’s family, fishing goes back a century. But neither of his two daughters fish, and with most on the Stade in their sixties, he fears he is one of Hasting’s last fishers.“It’s going to die out,” says White. “Fish shops are disappearing right left and centre.”He is semi-retired, but still fishes with his nephew, Darren, 49, on his boat, the RX56, the Sussex Girl. He loves being at sea more than he ever did. “I have a pension and no mortgage to pay, so there is no pressure,” he says. “Most fishermen don’t do it for the money, they do it for the life.”The Hastings Fishermen’s Protection Society, set up in 1831 to preserve the fishing community’s right to work from the beach, has helped train 10 young people over the past decade. All except one have left for better-paying jobs elsewhere.Shane Ball, 32, whose father is a fisher, left reluctantly in November for a job as a maintenance man. “All I ever wanted to do was fish,” he says. “I skippered for 12 years.“But it came time to get a mortgage. When you go out to sea, you have to pay the fuel and the crew. Sometimes, you are literally burning the diesel for nothing.”View image in fullscreenShane Ball out at sea on a 12-hour fishing trip with his father, Robert ‘Podgy’ Ball, on their boat, the Bethan Louise, in 2017The cost of fuel has rocketed, as have other costs afterhealth and safety rulesimposed on the small boats by the Maritime and Coastguard Agency in 2023.In May, the struggling sector was dealt a further blow after a “Brexit reset” deal between the European Union and the UK. Fishers condemned the deal as a “betrayal” because it granted large EU vessels 12 years of access to UK territorial waters, right up to where the small boats fish at six miles from the coast, a year before the existing deal was due to expire. Alongside the deal, the government announced a£360m fundto modernise the fleet, boost exports and support communities.Mark Ball, 62, who fishes with his son Jamie, 30, the youngest of the Hastings crew, says earning have plummeted in the past decade. “The only way we can maintain the boat now is if we take it out of savings.”View image in fullscreenMark Ball and his son Jamie gather their catch on the deck of their boatMike Cohen, the CEO of the National Federation of Fishermen’s Organisations, says theBrexitreset deal “was a big blow” that surrendered the best prospect fishing communities had to grow.“You’ve got our little boats fishing alongside 30m-plus Spanish, French, Portuguese boats and Dutch and Danish in some places too, that can stay at sea in all weathers, fish around the clock and stay at sea for a week or fortnight in weather that our boats can’t get out from port. They can’t compete.“We gave away access to waters and we got absolutely nothing back.”Cohen has called for a national strategy for fishing and marine food production, and to deploy the £360m fishing and coastal growth fund where needed.View image in fullscreenJoe Lee’s boat, the Maria Louise, beinglaunched from the Stade in 2021. Fishers say small boats cannot compete with larger EU trawlers that can stay out far longer and in worse weatherLast week, scientists from the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea, adviseda 77% reduction in fishing of North East Atlantic mackerel to prevent population collapse. Conservationists point to a lack of a unified management plan between countries to prevent overfishing. Catch limits between EU countries and the UK in the region have consistently exceeded limits recommended by scientists.Rob Pearson, chief fisheries and conservation officer for the Sussex Inshore Fisheries and Conservation Authority, argues that good inshore management is one of the reasons England has one of the largest smallscale fleets inEurope, but it is undermined by what is happening farther offshore. The changes in health and safety rules have also had a “massive impact” on recruitment, he says.‘Slavish’ catch limits ignored scientific advice, say conservationists in case against DefraRead more“The pathway to becoming an inshore fisherman was already a struggle. It’s harder to take a crew because of the safety requirements.”Back in Hastings, Lucy Phillips, 55, and skipper Paul Stanley, 59, are sorting nets on the deck of the RX11, Christine, on the Stade. Phillips, who worked as a translator before taking up fishing four years ago, says: “It makes me sad it’s declining.“We don’t want to become a toy town, where people leave the boats and it looks like a museum,” she says.View image in fullscreenPaul Stanley, the skipper, and his partner, Lucy Phillips, with their boat, ChristineIn the old days, the Stade was “like a big family”, says Kevin Bollen, 64. “Everyone knew everyone else. As kids we used to go and pull the boats off the beach. They would give us a few fish and we went round the houses selling them. When you got to my age, you would be the ‘boy ashore’, help bring the boat in and get a quarter of a share.“This used to be one of the richest fishing grounds in the UK. Now, you’d be really pushing yourself to take £15,000 a year.”Bollen sold his boat after a cancer diagnosis more than a decade ago. “Another 10 years, I don’t think there will be boats out.”Asked what will happen to the Stade when the last fisher leaves, Bollen replies: “It’ll be turned into a car park, won’t it?”View image in fullscreenKevin Bollen, right, with the skipper and boat owner,Darren Coglan, in the latter’s shedExplore more on these topicsSeascape: the state of our oceansFishing industryFish (Food)FoodFish (Environment)Marine lifeBrexitfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Rummo is the sixth-generation grandson of the founder of Pasta Rummo, who opened a wheat mill in Benevento in southern Italy in 1846, using the family’s three horses to lug grain from the surrounding Campania region and Puglia to produce fresh pasta.“Demand for premium pasta in the US has been growing,” says Rummo. Appreciated by consumers for a traditional processing method that guarantees it will cook toal denteperfection, sales ofPastaRummo have been thriving.“Our brand has grown especially fast over the last six years, something that took us by surprise, but which were are very proud of,” he said, but he fears the US president’s tariffs could put paid to that.Italian food producers had thought the worst was behind them when Trump agreed in August to reduce tariffs on imports of EU goods to a flat rate of 15%, and had been hoping hisfriendly relations with the Italian prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, would protect them from any further turbulence.View image in fullscreenAntonio Rummo.Photograph: Ilaria Corticelli/Rummo SpANot so. The world of pasta, a staple of Italy’s culinary heritage, has been thrown into disarray after Washington threatened to whack another 92% on some of the country’s oldest pasta manufacturers in what the Italian media has declared “Trump’s war against pasta”.Rummo says Pasta Rummo sells for about $4 (£3) a packet, but the price could double if the additional tariffs are applied.The extra duties, poised to take effect in January, are the result of an investigation by the US Department of Commerce into dumping practices, whereby foreign firms export goods at prices lower than in the domestic market to gain advantage over local competitors.The investigation, pushed by US rivals, specifically targeted the manufacturers La Molisana and Garofalo, given their volume of US sales, but by dint of association has left 11 other top Italian pasta brands, including the family-run Barilla and Pasta Rummo, in the line of fire.Italy’s pasta exports were worth more than €4bn (£3.5bn) in 2024, with the US among the top three destinations.The punitive outcome is proving difficult to digest for the Italian pasta makers, which are all preparing to take legal action. Giuseppe Ferro, the chief executive of La Molisana, which has been making pasta since 1912,told the Italian pressthe dumping accusations were unfounded and that he hoped Trump’s government would change its mind because otherwise “it would be impossible for us to work”.The tariffs are thought to be intended to encourage Italian producers to set up factories in the US, a strategy that appears to haveled to investmentsin other industries such as pharmaceuticals.La Molisana denied rumours that it would relent, while Emidio Mansi, the marketing director for Garofalo, said the company had no intention of opening factories in the US. “We have been in Gragnano [a town near Naples] since 1789 and are not moving,” he toldGambero Rosso.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But in the space of just a few years it has mutated into the nastiest, most revealing feud in hockey: one that’s exposed theNHL’s double standards, cronyism and cultural divide.The NHL preached inclusion. So why has it got into bed with Donald Trump?Read morePreseason hockey is meaningless by design, a handful of perfunctory tune-ups that even hardcore fans barely notice in the run-up to opening night, when the games finally start to count. Yet in the past week the Panthers and Lightning turned a pair of exhibition contests into three-hour fever dreams of violence: 114 penalties totaling nearly 500 minutes in the box, 16 game misconducts and one ejected playerwho somehow picked up an assiston an eighth goal that shouldn’t have counted. It was all-out bedlam before the season even began, but the uneven fallout has raised uncomfortable questions around the sport.It all kicked off last Thursday when Florida’s AJ Greersucker-punched Tampa’s Brandon Hagelin the head – a callback to last spring’s playoff meeting between the teams, whenHagel’s borderline hiton Panthers captain Aleksander Barkov sparked Florida defensemanAaron Ekblad’s retaliatory headshotthat left Hagel concussed. Greer’s cheap shot, punished with only a $2,000 fine, broke hockey’s unspoken code: you never go after a player with a known concussion history, especially one you’ve already injured.So on Saturday, Tampa iced a lineup of AHL enforcers and spent the night exacting frontier justice. The league’sresponse? Heavy fines and suspensions for the Lightning, none for Florida.The ugly scenes revived an old suspicion: that the NHL’s disciplinary system protects its favorites. The Panthers’ connections only make the optics worse. The league’s director of hockey operations, Colin Campbell, is a longtime power broker whose son is a minority owner and assistant general manager of – you guessed it – the Panthers. The head of player safety, George Parros, is a former Panther himself. A decade ago Campbell’s leaked emailsshowed him berating refereesfor not giving Florida preferential treatment. Nothing changed.Across theNHL, this latest bloodbath looked like business as usual: a vivid reminder that hockey’s old-boy network pulls the strings on a two-tiered system of justice.The bad blood has been brewing for years. For most of their existence the Panthers were an afterthought, overshadowed by the more successful Lightning, who won the first of their three Stanley Cups in 2004. Then they traded for Matthew Tkachuk – a brilliant, agitating forward – and hired a coach who encouraged the chaos. Overnight, the franchise became an almost comically ratty heel team: relentlessly annoying, gleefully abrasive and somehow good enough to win anyway. They ran goalies, took liberties after whistles, and seemed to delight in their role as the villains of modern hockey.Tampa, by contrast, had built their dynasty on cool precision: a team that mixed speed, skill and structure to win back-to-back Cups in 2020 and 2021. To Lightning fans, Florida’s rise represented something else: the triumph of cynicism, of hockey as provocation rather than craft.View image in fullscreenBrandon Hagel of the Tampa Bay Lightning, in blue, collides with Aleksander Barkov of the Florida Panthers during Game 1 of their Eastern Conference first-round playoff series in April.Photograph: Mike Carlson/Getty ImagesThe long-simmering tensions finally exploded in April’s postseason meeting. When Hagel flattened Barkov with what looked like a clean shoulder check – a hockey play at playoff speed gone wrong – the officials ruled it illegal because Barkov hadn’t touched the puck. Hagel was slapped with a one-game suspension. The next night Ekblad, who’d already served a lengthy ban earlier in the season for performance-enhancing drugs, hunted him down and delivered a full-force shot to the head, concussing him – a retaliatory hit that earned just two games. Florida went on to win the series and their second straight Cup, while Tampa were left muttering about double standards.So when Greer targeted Hagel again – during a meaningless September preseason game, no less – the Lightning saw red. Coach Jon Cooper rested his stars and called up six players from the minors – two known enforcers among them – to ice a full lineup without exposing his smaller, skilled forwards. Within minutes, 32-year-old bruiser Scott Sabourinleveled Ekblad with a single punchthat dropped him to his knees. From there the night descended into absurdity: brawls after nearly every whistle, fights in the penalty box, more than 300 combined penalty minutes and so many ejections that both teams ended with nine skaters. At one point, Florida’s Niko Mikkola even picked up an assist despite having been sent off minutes earlier. It’s not every night an ejected player somehow helps to extend an 8-0 lead before anyone notices.The next day, the discipline meted out by the NHL’s department of player safety came down squarely on Tampa. Six players fined, two suspended, the organization docked $100,000 and Cooper fined another $25,000. Florida’s Greer kept his token $2,000 fine. The perception was plain as day: the Panthers could do no wrong. And that sense of impunity is what has turned a once-anodyne cross-state rivalry into something much darker: a microcosm of how the NHL still protects its insiders and punishes its critics.That defiance fits neatly with the Panthers’ broader identity. Under owner Vincent Viola – a billionaire financier andone-time Donald Trump nomineefor secretary of the army – the franchise has cultivated an overtly Maga aesthetic. After their first Cup win, team executives proudly visited Trump at the White House, presenting him with a custom “45–47” jersey. Viola’s longtime business partner and minority owner Douglas Cifu, the Panthers’ vice-chairman and alternate governor, also runs Virtu Financial, the high-frequency trading firm he co-founded with Viola. In May, Cifu was suspended indefinitely by the NHL afteran inflammatory social-media exchangewith a Canadian fan where he invoked the Israel-Palestine conflict and Trump’s 51st state taunts, a move that did little to distance the team from its hard-right image.View image in fullscreenUnder billionaire owner Vincent Viola, center, the Florida Panthers have cultivated an unmistakably Maga aesthetic.Photograph: Kevin Dietsch/Getty ImagesAcross the state, the Lightning’s ownership has taken the opposite tack: removing a Robert E Lee statue from downtown Tampa, supporting diversity initiatives and hosting some of the league’s most inclusive heritage nights.In miniature, the Battle of Florida now mirrors the United States itself: grievance and aggression on one side, progressive branding on the other, both locked in a fight over what the sport, and the country, should be.The irony is that all this has unfolded during what’s meant to be the NHL’s modern age of enlightenment. League executives boast about player safety and mental-health awareness, and evolving beyond the blood-and-guts spectacle of decades past. Yet its disciplinary machinery still operates with the opaque impunity of an old boys’ club. When New York Rangers owner James Dolansemi-publicly condemnedthe league’s refusal to suspend Washington’s Tom Wilson in 2021, the NHL didn’t revisit the call; itfined the team $250,000for daring to question it. Commissioner Gary Bettman scolded the Rangers for “demeaning” a league executive and declared such criticism “unacceptable”. The message was clear enough: silence is rewarded, dissent is punished and the culture that enables violence is the one most fiercely protected.This time, though, the silence has cracked. Around the league, executives and players are said to be quietly rooting for Tampa – not because they condone vigilante justice, but because they recognize the futility of appealing to a system stacked against them. The Panthers may have won the Stanley Cup for two years running, but they’ve also become the embodiment of a league that rewards swagger and punishes accountability.That the NHL’s biggest controversy of the year erupted before a single regular-season game had been played says it all. The sport that keeps promising to modernize still can’t stop celebrating its own anarchy: a league where power, not principle, decides who gets away with what – and who gets left bleeding on the ice.Explore more on these topicsNHLFlorida PanthersTampa Bay LightningUS sportsIce hockeyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Police say the incident happened after a dispute over a parking space.Sanchez, 38, could face up to six years in jail if he is found guilty of the battery charge.Tole has also filed a lawsuitagainst Sanchez, with his lawyers saying their client suffered “severe permanent disfigurement, loss of function” and emotional distress.“We are literally talking about people fighting over a parking space and-or a dispute about where people are parking, and it resulted in someone receiving just incredibly significant injures,” Marion county prosecutor Ryan Mears said on Monday.Sanchez has pleaded not guilty to the charges against him, which also include battery with injury, public intoxication and unlawful entry of a vehicle.Fox Sports have yet to address Sanchez’s long-term future with the broadcaster. The Jets picked Sanchez with the fifth overall selection in the 2009NFLdraft after he enjoyed a successful college career in his native California. He led the Jets to two AFC Championship games before spells with several teams, including the Eagles and Dallas Cowboys. He announced his retirement from the NFL in 2019 and soon after began working with ESPN’s college football coverage before transitioning to Fox.Explore more on these topicsNFLIndianapolisUS sportsFoxUS television industrynewsShareReuse this content"

It was possible to remember the words of the Wales manager asEnglandsurged into a 3-0 lead inside 20 minutes. It felt like a technical knockout, this friendly over with indecent haste.Thomas Tuchel had stood by the players who had ignited his England tenure in September with the5-0 World Cup qualifying winagainst Serbia in Belgrade, the buildup dominated by his omissions of Jude Bellingham, in particular, and Phil Foden. The manager simply wanted his team to build on the momentum they had generated, the excitement they created.‘The stadium was silent’: Tuchel critical of England support during Wales winRead moreIt was not as if Wembley was electrified, the Super Tommy Tuchel energy coursing everywhere.Waleswere so poor in the first half that it did not feel like a fair fight. But there was still plenty for Tuchel to like ahead of the trip to play Latvia in Riga on Tuesday when his team could seal automatic qualification to the World Cup.It was not a night when Bellingham or Foden were missed. Morgan Rogers made sure of that, excelling in the No 10 role. He opened the scoring with his first England goal and set up the second for Ollie Watkins, who played in place of the injured Harry Kane. Bukayo Saka was good, too, adding one of his specials for the third and that was basically that.Wales, at least, roused themselves and they went close to a goal in the final stages which would have delighted their vociferous fans, who stayed until the bitter end – unlike their England counterparts. They sloped off long before full time. They had seen enough.It was easy to fear for Wales in the early running – from the moment that Anthony Gordon was allowed so much space inside the area to work Karl Darlow. Bellamy had pledged to play on the front foot and he went with a strong lineup ahead of Monday’s crucial qualifying tie against Belgium in Cardiff.But his players were meek, some of their efforts in the duels powder puff, embarrassing. England toyed with them, repeatedly getting in behind and they tore into a three-goal advantage. The manner of the concessions were galling for Bellamy, his plans laid to waste.View image in fullscreenMorgan Rogers opens the scoring for England from close range in the third minute.Photograph: Marc Atkins/Getty ImagesThe most interesting selection for Tuchel was probably John Stones, who he was able to play for the first time. Tuchel shunted Ezri Konsa to right-back in order to accommodate Stones alongside Marc Guéhi. Both centre-halves were involved in the breakthrough, the former getting his head to a Declan Rice corner and Guéhi doing well to stretch and keep the ball in on the byline. Wales assumed he would not reach it and stopped. Guéhi pinged it back for Rogers, whose first-time shot was marked by nonchalance.The second goal was even worse from a Wales point of view. England had men over at the far post when Saka crossed from the inside left and it was Rogers rather than Rice who sent over a short-range lob. Guéhi could not score but Watkins had the time to control at the far post, allow the ball to drop and then touch home from one yard.When the third went in, there was one obvious question after David Brooks had shown Saka inside and watched him bend a trademark left-footed curler into the far top corner; a lovely finish. Had he never seen Saka play before?A penny for Bellamy’s thoughts at the interval. Actually, they were not difficult to imagine. Gordon subjected Neco Williams to a torrid first 45 minutes, all speed and slippery skills but the Wales right-back was hardly alone in going awol. Rogers had fun in between the lines; Welsh resistance was conspicuous only by its absence.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Saka was denied by a Joe Rodon block after running up the inside right channel at 2-0 while Watkins was guilty of a grisly miss in the 40th minute, slicing off target from Elliot Anderson’s blast across the face of goal.Marcus Rashford has good memories of playing Wales. Hescored two in the 3-0 winover them at the Qatar World Cup and Tuchel got him on for Watkins at the start of the second half. He asked Rashford to work off the left and switched Gordon into a central attacking role, with Rogers in support.Tuchel did not want England’s levels to drop. He had a mini melt-down when Gordon, having won possession and streaked clear up the inside right, could not execute the cross to Rashford, who was free in front of goal. Saka then cut Wales open for Rogers to hit the crossbar, although Rice was offside in the buildup.What was this on 56 minutes? A Wales shot and a good one, too, Brooks’ volley forcing Jordan Pickford to save with his feet. England did drop off in the closing stages and Wales restored a measure of pride by pushing for a consolation goal, which they almost got.One substitute, Chris Mepham, extended Pickford with a header while another, Mark Harris, nodded over from close range, although he looked to have fouled Stones.Explore more on these topicsFriendliesEnglandWalesmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

But which player will break that cycle?Oliver ConnollyThu 9 Oct 2025 04.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 9 Oct 2025 11.39 EDTShareThere has been a trend in recentNFLseasons. Around Week 8, the MVP race starts to follow a predictable script: Patrick Mahomes, Josh Allen and Lamar Jackson (if the Ravens are rolling) will almost certainly feature.Between 2015 and 2019, the NFL had four first-time MVP winners – Cam Newton, Matt Ryan, Mahomes and Jackson. But in the last five years, only Allen has been a first-time winner (Aaron Rodgers, Mahomes and Jackson were the other victors).Allen is favorite to go back-to-back this season, which would make it five times in the last six years the league has crowned a previous winner. But voters experience fatigue; everyone wants a fresh star. And this year’s list of first-time candidates feels unusually deep and unusually fun. Maybe these guys won’t winthisyear, but let’s look at the players who could break up the Mahomes-Allen-Jackson triumvirate in the next few seasons.A few notes: the ratings below are for the players’ chances of winning the award in the next few years, not specifically this season. We’ve also left out perennial contenders like Joe Burrow, Matthew Stafford and Dak Prescott in favor of some longer shots.Sam Darnold, Seattle SeahawksIt’s no longer a joke: Darnold is one of the best quarterbacks in the NFL. In Minnesota, it was easy to scoff at his ascent. You could point to the schematic environment and his excellent supporting cast. That’s not the case in Seattle.The Seahawks’ run game has yet to gel. The offensive line is improved, but still lags behind the league’s best. Jaxon Smith-Njigba has been one of the five best receivers in the league this year, but has been elevated by the decision-making and accuracy of Darnold.Jets, Ravens … Eagles? Which team is most miserable after five weeks of the NFL season?Read moreSeattle have retooled their offense around Darnold, who is still only 28 (younger than Burrow, who was drafted two years later). They hunt chunk plays, banking on Darnold’s arm to push the ball down the field. In that role, he looks more like Stafford than the Darnold we saw during his Jets years. Early in his career, Darnold struggled when pressured, staring down the rush and gagging away costly turnovers. He’s stripped much of that fat from his game.Where once he saw ghosts, now he is creating plays when his protection breaks down or the structure of the offense is off.Sam Darnold has come a long way since those days he was seeing ghostsThis is flow Statepic.twitter.com/I1kvzeyj8n— NFL Draft Files (@NFL_DF)October 5, 2025Bounce through whatever quarterback metric you like, and Darnold is at the top, or near the top, of the list. He leads the league in the RBSDM composite, which pieces together the value of every offensive play and measures how much a quarterback can be deemed responsible for that value. Whoever tops that number by the end of the year typically winds up in the final three in MVP voting.Through five weeks, Darnold has proved last season in Minnesota was no fluke. This is who he is now, and that’s been an upgrade for Seattle over Geno Smith. If he can lead the Seahawks to a division title, the redemption narrative will carry him into the conversation with Allen and Mahomes.MVP likelihood:7/10. This year could be his best chance to win it.Baker Mayfield, Tampa Bay BuccaneersSpeaking of redemption arcs. There was a time when the Panthers employed Baker MayfieldandDarnold. Oof. Mayfield has gone fromscout team pass-rusherin Carolina to franchise quarterback in Tampa Bay.The MVP is, to an extent, a narrative award, and few have a cooler story than Mayfield. Burrow, Stafford and Prescott are better quarterbacks. But there is something about his story that should garner extra credit among voters. Multiple franchises gave up on him before he arrived in Tampa. He’s had three different offensive coordinators in the last three seasons, but has continued to pilot the Bucs offense at the highest level.Mayfield hasn’t been as clean this year as he was in 2024. Down to down, he’s been a little scattershot. But he’s working in a tricky environment: Tampa’s run game has stalled, and the offensive line has been weakened by injuries. Yet despite those problems, Mayfield is playing the best all-around ball of his career. He’s already led the Bucs to four game-winning drives this season and he leads the league in Big Time Throw Rate, according to Pro Football Focus. He is doing more with less, including waltzing into Seattle with a beat-up line anddropping 38 pointson one of the best defenses in football (though one that had plenty of injury issues to deal with of its own).View image in fullscreenBaker Mayfield has turned his career around with Tampa Bay.Photograph: Kevin Sabitus/Getty ImagesIn a time before advanced analytics, Mayfield would be leading this year’s race. He has put his team on his back more than any other quarterback in crunch time. Voters still value that stuff, but not quite to the same degree they did in the 1990s and early 2000s.MVP likelihood:4/10. His gambler style will lead him to throw a few games away.Jayden Daniels, Washington CommandersDaniels returned from injury against the Chargers on Sunday and reminded everyone why, last season, he wasthe most impressive rookieto enter the league in a generation. Daniels shredded the Chargers in the second half on the road, lifting the Commanders to a comfortable win in LA.It hasn’t been the smoothest start to his second season. The Commanders’ team-building approach around Daniels has been peculiar. They’ve tried to fast-track success, recognizing they’ve hit on something special with a quarterback on a cheap rookie contract. But they’re left with the oldest roster in the league by some distance. And it shows, particularly on defense.Over the medium term, Washington’s roster construction could ding Daniels. But he remains a one-man supernova at the game’s most valuable position. He is the closest quarterback in the league to Jackson: a precision passer who is also electric with the ball in his hands as a runner. If he can push the Commanders past the Eagles at the top of the NFC East in the next couple of years, he will be a lock for the award.MVP likelihood: 8/10. The surest player from his vaunted rookie class to win in the next three years.Justin Herbert, Los Angeles ChargersIt was all going so well for Herbert and the Chargers. Two weeks into the season, it felt like this was hisyear. Finally, the pieces around him were slotted into place. And the Chargers had shifted to a Herbert-centric offense, turning from a run-focused group into a passing one. It was as if Jim Harbaugh set out with the goal of winning Herbert the MVP award just as much as he was looking to dethrone the Chiefs in the AFC West.That’s changed. The Chargers have lost too many pieces along their offensive line. They dropped a winnable game against the Giants and were hammered along both sides of the line of scrimmage by the Commanders. The degree of difficulty for Herbert at this point, this season, is too high. Even to keep the chains moving, he has to strap on his superhero cape. That’s fun in small samples – and valuable for the MVP award when it comes under a national spotlight – but unsustainable over the slog of a regular season.Herbert has MVP talent. When the Chargers are healthy, he is the favorite for the award among the players on this list. He fits the billing: the rule of new, the playmaking, the winning. He passes the eye test and holds a monopoly over some of the fanciest metrics. But it won’t be this year.MVP likelihood:9/10. Eventually, the Chargers will stay healthy, and Herbert will break through.Travis Hunter, Jacksonville JaguarsThe MVP is a quarterback award – the last non-QB to win it was Adrian Peterson in the 2012 season. Still, playing on both sides of the ball is a big help for anyone trying to upset the quarterback cartel.It’s been an inauspicious start for Hunter as a two-way phenom. The Jags have bounced back and forth between primarily using him on offense and defense. Last week, they settled on a 40-snap rotation on either side of the ball. And that feels like the right figure for a rookie trying to get up to the speed of the pro game while learning a complex offense and the league’s most disguise-laden defense.TRAVIS HUNTER OMG 😱WHAT A CATCH FOR THE ROOKIE 🔥pic.twitter.com/nDrJOPSGit— ESPN (@espn)October 7, 2025Hunter has been fine as a rookie, but he hasn’t been an instant gamechanger. There have been flashes of the talent that made him the Heisman winner, but he has yet to take over a game while playing both ways. At some point, the Jags may settle on using him on one side while only bringing him on the field for select packages the other way. But that’s not the plan at the moment.That may make Hunter’s development curve steeper, but it also ups his MVP potential. Who else could realistically have double-digit touchdowns as a receiver while also grabbing five or more takeaways? If Hunter realizeshis Ohtani-like potentialon both sides of the ball, voters will look past the quarterbacks.MVP likelihood.5/10. The only “defensive” player who has a sniff.View image in fullscreenDrake Maye has bought stability to the Patriots after a period of post-Brady drift.Photograph: Charles Krupa/APDrake Maye, New England PatriotsMaye burst into the national spotlight with his performance on the road in Buffalo on Sunday. But he has been steadily putting together an MVP campaign all season.The Patriots are fourth in the league in passing efficiency this year. A lot of that has to do with the return of Josh McDaniels. The offensive coordinator has schemed up wide-open receivers all over the place. But it also speaks to Maye’s development. He’s cut down his brain-farts-per-game from four to two. He’s mastering the easy things. And when the offense falls apart and he’s asked to create on his own, he looks like a mini Josh Allen.The advanced data paints him as thefourth-most valuable quarterbackin the league this season. And it’s hard to disagree. His accuracy has improved. He doesn’t throw interceptions. He can rip it to all parts of the field and he is a legitimate dual-threat. Oh, and he’s doing it with a so-so offensive line, a crop of running backs who continually fumble, and a blah batch of receivers outside Stefon Diggs.This year may be a season too early. But the Patriotsshouldmake the playoffs, given their start and upcoming schedule. As they continue to add talent, Maye’s chances will grow.MVP likelihood: 6/10.He’s working on the Allen timeline.Jaron-Keawe Sagapolutele, CalWildcard time. If Allen, Mahomes and Jackson continue to share the MVP award among themselves, the next first-time winner may not even be in the league yet.Every year when the draft rolls around, prognosticators will tell fanbases not to worry about that year’s crop of shaky quarterback talent.Just wait until next year!Some organizations always seem to be waiting for the next mass influx of talented QBs.Last year was no different, but the 2026 draft class has so far disappointed. Arch Manning, Garrett Nussmeier and LaNorris Sellers, shoo-ins to be high draft picks before the season, have struggled. There is no sure-fire No 1 pick, but rather a crop of eight talented yet flawed prospects that teams are considering at the top of the draft.Excuse me what nowI have no idea how Jaron Keawe Sagapolutele fitted this throw in for Trond Grizzellsheeshpic.twitter.com/6Ur5UEUIKx— Thomas Dunn (@Thomasdunn24)October 5, 2025So let’s punt even further down the road. The most exciting quarterback in college this year is Sagapolutele, a true freshman at Cal. The Hawaiian transferred out of Oregon after losing a quarterback battle to Dante Moore – a potential future No 1 overall pick – and already looks the part of a future franchise quarterback. A lefty, Sagapolutele is the kind of intelligent, decisive, pocket passer that pro teams covet. He also happens to have a rocket for an arm and is an explosive runner.Sagapolutele will not be eligible to enter the draft until 2028. That means he won’t enter real MVP conversations for at least five years, if he continues on his current trajectory. But if he were eligible this year, he would be the favorite to be taken No 1 overall.MVP likelihood:2/10. He’s two years away from being two years away and a lot can happen between college and the pros.Explore more on these topicsNFLSeattle SeahawksTampa Bay BuccaneersWashington CommandersLos Angeles ChargersJacksonville JaguarsNew England PatriotsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Minutes later he was woken up by a doping control officer at his front door: “I’m dying in my bed and somehow I hear the guy come. Barely. I’m dead and he’s coming,” says Monfils, laughing.One of the requirements of being an elite player is providing your location for an hour each day as part of the anti-doping whereabouts system, which allows the anti-doping authorities to conduct unannounced out-of-competition doping tests. For years the Frenchman, like most other players, has assigned 6am as his usual hour, a time he is certain to be at home or in his hotel room.‘You want a player to die?’ Heat is on tennis after players wilt in extreme conditionsRead moreOn this occasion an exhausted Monfils opted for an unorthodox solution: “I say: ‘Bro, there’s no chance I [can] pee. I know you have to be with me. Come to my room.’“I put down a chair. He was there and I said: ‘Sorry, I’m going to sleep. I don’t know when I’m going to wake up, but you can have a vision on me. It’s not that I don’t want to pee. I’ll be honest – I’ve been out. I peed like five minutes ago. I can’t.’”It turned out to be a far longer nap than Monfils had anticipated: “I woke up at 3pm, the guy was scrolling his phone. [I say] ‘Hey, bro.’ I pee. So he was waiting for me for 10 hours. He could steal everything in my house.”Along with training, fitness, matches and the relentless challenge of travelling to tournaments around the world, being a professional means navigating the World Anti-Doping Agency’s strict regulations, to which all athletes in Olympic sports must adhere. No matter how long it takes, every player must provide a urine or blood sample when called upon.Once a player is selected for a test, the doping control officer must stay with the athlete and watch them at all times. That often means hosting a complete stranger in their home. Tallon Griekspoor, the Dutch No 1, recalls a time when a doping control officer spent three hours on his sofa: “We were rewatching an Ajax match for 90 minutes.”Athletes can also be approached outside their chosen time, a source of irritation for some. If a doping control officer calls and they are in the vicinity of the location they provided the player is obliged to immediately return to the location. Last year, the talented Czech 19-year-old Jakub Mensik had to leave his high school graduation to go back home for a test. It took him three hours to produce a sample.Taylor Fritz was once intercepted by a doping control officer in his Shanghai hotel lobby as he arrived from a long flight: “The guy was in my room and I was taking naps for 10 minutes at a time because I was so jetlagged and so tired. I kept on waking myself up every 10 minutes to see if I could pee because I couldn’t.”View image in fullscreenTaylor Fritz had to make an official wait when he was too tired and jetlagged to provide a sample.Photograph: Alex Plavevski/EPAThe doping control officer is also required to watch athletes closely as they deposit their sample. The Frenchman Arthur Fils stresses the unusual nature of such encounters: “One stranger who is looking at you when you are peeing is pretty tough,” he says, laughing. “So every time it’s a weird situation.”For Jack Draper, this has led to some particularly awkward experiences: “It’s a difficult moment, right? Sometimes you push so hard that you’re farting and you’re right next to them.”Despite the unusual nature of these interactions, Andrey Rublev notes that players get used to them. Often seeing the same faces helps: “Sometimes if the guy is maybe a rookie or I have never seen him before, he will be a bit like a principal: ‘Now, put your pants down to your knees.’ I say, ‘Man, what’s the difference if it’s to the knees or not?’ He says, ‘No, these are the rules. Everybody has to follow.’“Sometimes I face those guys, but it was maybe one or two times in my life. The rest, they are respectful, they are OK. They are there, they are watching, but they’re not trying to make you crazy.”Draper often reminds himself that these encounters are less than ideal for all involved: “It’s a tough job for them. I always keep that in mind. Some people get annoyed because it is a very intimate situation. But I feel for that person. It’s their job.”In the final weeks of the 2016 season, Madison Keys was chasing a spot in the WTA Finals. Hours after her semi-final loss in Beijing, Keys had already secured a last-minute wildcard into the Linz Open: “We ran to the hotel, packed and got on a plane two hours later and I forgot to update my whereabouts [to say] that I wasn’t going to be in Beijing – I was going to be on a plane. They came the next morning. I remember landing in Linz and immediately sobbing, like: ‘Oh no, I have a strike.’ It’s so stressful.”Many players cite managing their whereabouts information as one of their biggest causes of stress, particularly in a sport that requires so much travelling and last-minute itinerary changes. However, it is a significant part of their job. Like many others, the British No 2, Cameron Norrie, works with his agent to manage his whereabouts: “We have a group chat and we screenshot [the app] every night, or he sends it, and we know exactly where it is going to be every night.”Jessica Pegula, however, refuses to let anyone else handle her whereabouts: “I do it by myself. I just would never want someone else doing that because if they messed up, I’d be livid.”View image in fullscreenJessica Pegula prefers to take sole responsibility for her whereabouts.Photograph: VCG/Getty ImagesIncurring one strike is far from unusual. During a recent period off the tour due to injury, Bianca Andreescu extended her trip in Thailand by one day, but forgot to change her whereabouts information. The next day she received a call from an official at her front door in Monaco.Pegula says: “I know there’s a lot of girls that maybe messed up a couple dates and [were] on their second or third strike and they’re like, ‘That was the worst year of my life. I didn’t sleep. I was just laying in bed.’ You’re making sure the doorbell works. Every single phone is on. It can be very stressful.”As with most other sports, numerous tennis players have been banned for whereabouts failures after missing three tests within 12 months. Recent examples include Mikael Ymer and Jenson Brooksby receiving 18-month suspensions in 2023. Brooksby’s ban was lifted early in 2024.Keys thinks missing tests is far easier than most people believe. “It’s stressful, it’s hard,” she says. “I understand why it needs to be done, but it’s funny how it seems like a really simple thing, but to actually account for an hour, 365 days a year, every single year, you make mistakes.”Fritz concurs: “It’s important that we have fair sport and people are able to get tested at random times. But the one thing I will say is people shouldn’t underestimate how just … shit happens.”Explore more on these topicsTennisDrugs in sportfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Instead, United’s largest minority owner reached for the easy punchbag of the media to opt out of facing the hard truth of the team under Amorim.Discussing the 40-year-old’s position, Ratcliffe said: “You can’t run a club likeManchester Unitedon kneejerk reactions to some journalist who goes off on one every week.”Fair enough, except Ratcliffe would struggle to name any football scribe who leads United’s training sessions, selects the XI and sticks to a rigid 3-4-3 that has drawn a desultory 20 wins and 21 losses from 50 games, as Amorim has.Or who turned up for the opening fixture of the season against a serious title contender (Arsenal) in a pickle over who should be his No 1 goalkeeper despite signalling discontent last April with the incumbent (André Onana). Result: Altay Bayindir, in for the Cameroonian, was culpable forthe Gunners’ winner at Old Trafford.And, also, failed to recruit an elite No 6, leaving Casemiro’s ageing legs and Manuel Ugarte’s untrusted ones to service the United engine room until the winter window, at least.View image in fullscreenManuel Ugarte has not convinced in central midfield for Manchester United.Photograph: Vince Mignott/MB Media/Getty ImagesAmorim is being scrutinised by the media, pundits, United fans and other enthusiasts because of his track record at United. What will influence Ratcliffe is the financial bottom line – the lingua franca of the Ineos billionaire and the six Glazer siblings who collectively are United’s majority owners.So far, so bad.Defeat in May’s Europa League finalby Tottenham meant no Champions League football this season and the loss of about £100m from competing in the blue-riband tournament. The all-time Premier League low finish of 15th yielded £136.2m from the cash-soaked competition, but that was a near £50m – or the best part of a Matheus Cunha – less than Liverpool’s £174.9m cash prize for taking the title.If this trend of failure to claim a trophy and plunging league form continues the plug will surely be pulled on Amorim by Ratcliffe, the head of football policy, far sooner than three years.After a summer net spend of about £170m (signing Cunha, Benjamin Sesko, Senne Lammens and Diego Léon) United were supposed to hit the ground running. Instead, three losses (to Arsenal, Manchester City and Brentford), three wins (against Burnley, Chelsea and Sunderland) and a draw at Fulham can be characterised as a faltering start, at best, and the 12-11 Carabao Cup penalty shootoutloss to fourth-tier Grimsbywas a farrago, the poorest/most unprofessional United display witnessed by these eyes in 13 years as the club correspondent.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The answer, politely, is: how can there be until two consecutive league matches, at least, are won under him for the first time? Afterbeating Sunderland 2-0before the international break, United go to Anfield. Do not bet the farm on him finally breaking that barrier against the champions.Consider Amorim’s run in the league. In 34 top-flight outings, 37 points have been accrued. Amorim has won 10 matches.In the same interview with The Business podcast, Ratcliffe said: “Football is not overnight. You look at [Mikel] Arteta at Arsenal. He had a miserable time over the first couple of years.”The Spaniard did, but he had the FA Cup triumph of 2020 (his opening season) as ballast and he did not finish 15th then. Instead, the Gunners placed eighth and have since been eighth, fifth, second, second and second.Ratcliffe is said to find piloting United “stressful”, an insight into how, while everyone expects him to have answers to every question, he is human too. Maybe the job’s stresses explain why he offered three years as a mark of when Amorim can be judged.No one knows where Amorim will take the United train. But another annus horribilis – or even a poor next few weeks – and the head coach can surely not survive.Explore more on these topicsManchester UnitedRuben AmorimJim RatcliffecommentShareReuse this content"

Toronto’s only pennants came in 1992 and ‘93, when the club won consecutive World Series crowns.Ryan McMahon homered for the wild-card Yankees, unable to stave off elimination for a fourth time this postseason as they failed to repeat as AL champions.Despite a terrific playoff performance from Aaron Judge following his previous October troubles, the 33-year-old star slugger remains without a World Series ring. New York are still chasing their 28th title and first since 2009.Lukes made it 4-1 with a two-run single after an error by Yankees second baseman Jazz Chisholm Jr cost rookie starter Cam Schlittler a chance to get through the seventh with an inning-ending double play.Myles Straw, who came in off the bench for outfield defense, added an RBI single in the eighth after Alejandro Kirk’s leadoff double.With the score tied 1-all, Ernie Clement singled leading off the Toronto fifth and went to third when No 9 batter Andrés Giménez bounced a single through the middle. Clement, who had nine hits in the series, scored on Springer’s sacrifice fly.Toronto opener Louis Varland, who gave up game-changing homers Tuesday to Judge and Chisholm in relief, became the first pitcher in major league history to lose a postseason game and start the next day.Varland worked one and one-third scoreless innings with two strikeouts, and a parade of seven relievers followed. None of them got more than five outs – but all were effective.On the other side, Schlittler joined Dakota Hudson (2019 for St Louis) as the only rookies in big league history to make their first two postseason starts in potential elimination games.Schlittler was coming off one of the most dominant pitching performances in playoff annals, when he struck out 12 and walked none over eight innings to beat rival Boston 4-0 in the winner-take-all Game 3 of their wildcard series last Thursday at Yankee Stadium.This time, the 24-year-old right-hander fell behind 1-0 after six pitches. Springer hit a leadoff double and scored when Guerrero lined an 0-2 cutter just inside the right-field line for an RBI single.With two on, left fielder Cody Bellinger sprinted 113 feet for a sliding catch at the line that saved at least one run – maybe two.Batting ninth, McMahon tied it when he fought back from 0-2 to a full count leading off the third and reached across the plate to hook an 83mph sweeper from left-hander Mason Fluharty over the short porch in right field for his first postseason homer.The 6ft 6in Schlittler struck out only two, but he didn’t walk a batter in six and one-third efficient innings. He was charged with four runs – two earned – and eight hits.Explore more on these topicsMLBToronto Blue JaysNew York YankeesBaseballUS sportsShareReuse this content"

Fifa has set up a working group to examine the issue, and the global governing body has given itself a headache by awarding the 2034World Cupto Saudi Arabia. That tournament will almost certainly be staged in winter, as Qatar 2022 was. Infantino suggested the sport should get used to untying itself from the European summer.Club World Cup has left an injury trail that is damaging football. But will anyone listen? | Jacob SteinbergRead more“We are already into the nitty-gritty, we are discussing all the time,” he said. “It’s not just about one World Cup, it’s a general reflection. Even to play in some European countries in July it is very, very hot. The best month to play football, which is June, is not used very much in Europe.“Maybe there are ways we can optimise the calendar, but we are discussing it and we will see when we come to some conclusions. We just have to keep an open mind.”Infantino was speaking on the sidelines of the European Football Clubs – formerly European Club Association – general assembly in Rome. He had expressed similar sentiments to the event’s 900 delegates, saying: “We should look into the globalisation of the international match calendar.” He cited October and March as “the months you can play everywhere”.Such a drastic reconfiguration would cause ructions, although Fifa’s ability to implement its wishes may be compromised if a formal complaint against its imposition of the calendar, filed to the European Commission last year by European Leagues, Fifpro and La Liga, leads to proceedings being opened.View image in fullscreenEuropean Football Clubs President Nasser Al-Khelaifi (right) with Gianni Infantino at the EFC General Assembly.Photograph: Fabrizio Corradetti/APFifa is also looking at ways to expand the Club World Cup.A 48-team structure is possible for its next edition, in 2029,with the potential for a qualifying playoff event that whittles the final number down to 32. Infantino alluded to ambitious plans in his Rome speech, saying Fifa would “work to see how we can make this event bigger, even better, even more impactful”.Spain and Morocco are favourites to host the 2029 event, which will take place in the summer, although other contenders have been weighed up. A swift return to the US could be entertained and it is understood China, which had been due to host the tournament in 2021 until Covid-19 hit, remains interested.Fifa is considering holding theClub World Cupevery two years after 2029. Qatar is the strong frontrunner to host any 2031 edition, a move that would be made more straightforward if Infantino’s favoured rejig is achieved given a winter scheduling would be inevitable.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

On Monday,Uefa said it had given La Liga and Serie A permissionto play a match in the US and Australia respectively, emphasising this was granted on an exceptional basis. Fifa’s final say is a formality, but Infantino appeared to suggest the prospect did not sit easily.“We have a structure whereby we have games at national level, continental level and global level,” he said. “This is the structure that made football the No 1 sport in the world. If we want to break this structure, we take a big risk. If we want to regulate it, then we have to look into it. We have to speak to all the stakeholders.“I think we need a reflection that is more global on what we want to do. Do we want everyone to play everywhere and do whatever he wants? Fine, Fifa is pretty strong in this respect. Or do we want to have a regulated system that takes into account the interests of everyone at national level, continental level and club level, but also the legitimacy of everyone to organise events and regulate the sport in their own country?”Among other developments at the EFC general assembly was confirmation of Barcelona’s return to the fold, which had been trailed by the club president, Joan Laporta’s, presence at the official dinner on Wednesday. Barcelona withdrew from the organisation after the abortive Super League project in 2021, which they had driven alongside Real Madrid and Juventus.The EFC president, Nasser al-Khelaifi, joked that their rekindled relationship had been formalised during a “romantic walk”. Their readmission appears to pour further cold water on any revival of the Super League scheme.Explore more on these topicsFifaWorld CupClub World CupGianni InfantinoFootball politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

It has been a unique journey for the site where Fort Lauderdale’s Lockhart Stadium once stood.“Even after all these years it’s so funny to me that Lionel Messi, one of the most famous faces in the history of mankind, is not only playing for our club but playing in this stadium that was abandoned,” said Nico Abad, a member of The Siege supporters’ group and a native of Broward County, where Chase Stadium stands on the former site of Lockhart. “It’s where kids would go to do doughnuts and to smoke and drink.”The former home of the defunct Fort Lauderdale Strikers and erstwhile MLS side Miami Fusion was demolished by the newly established Inter Miami in 2019 and rejuvenated almost as a last resort, after years offailed stadium projectsin Miami itself threatened the club’s ability to even exist. Founding owner David Beckham’s consolation prize north of Vice City would ultimately become a once-in-a-generation experience for the area’s soccer fans, drawing the eyes of the world.Philadelphia Union clinch MLS Supporters Shield: ‘This has been building since Matchday 1’Read moreThat era is almost over. On Saturday, Chase Stadium will host its final MLS regular season game whenInter Miamiplay Atlanta. After the playoffs, it’ll have served its purpose. The time has come for Inter Miami to play in Miami proper.Next season, the club moves into the purpose-built home inMiamiFreedom Park, a 25,000-capacity arena forming the centrepiece of a “soccer village” with shopping, restaurants, office space, and a lush park next to the city’s international airport. It’ll be quite a contrast from the stopgap in Broward County, amid a blue-collar heart of auto repair shops beside an airfield.While in a sense this is a reward for Miami-based supporters who may well have spent far longer in traffic to Chase Stadium than watching football there, there’s genuine affection among fans for their intimate temporary home.There are legitimate reasons why Chase Stadium works. The fans are close to the pitch. There are high school-like, open air bleachers behind the goal, where the most vocal and ardent fans gather and are fully exposed to south Florida’s unpredictable summer weather. It’s like coming to watch a lower division club, until you turn to the field to see Messi, Sergio Busquets, Rodrigo De Paul, Jordi Alba and Luis Suárez. Beckham too.“[It] has grown on me in its mediocrity,” said Abad. “After 150 games there, you do end up having a crush on it. I won’t miss the sauna porta potties. I’m looking forward to air-conditioned bathrooms.”Many fans recounted those spellbinding early Messi games as their finest football memories. There was the near disbelief of the Argentinian’s July 2023 unveiling in tropical rains dubbed “Hurricane Messi” and then thestoppage-time free-kick to win the gameon his debut in the Leagues Cup against Cruz Azul – a tournament he would lead them to win.The stadium has also brought down the curtain on legendary careers. Gonzalo Higuaín retired a Heron. Busquets and Jordi Albawill retireat the end of this campaign. Suarez is 38 and his contract expires this season.“The experience is special because it feels like a small club right now,” said Miami-based season-ticket holder Paul Zamek. “When Suárez or Busquets score, they run to their families. We’re so close you can see the emotion. I’ll miss that intimacy.”Zamek’s fellow season-ticket holder Mason Harris added: “This is where I got to bond with my kids and watch them show interest in the sport. They didn’t before, so this stadium will always have that for me.”View image in fullscreenLionel Messi has been able to celebrate goals and big moments with his family in fieldside suites at Chase Stadium.Photograph: Megan Briggs/Getty ImagesLockhart Stadium was originally built in 1959 for high school track and field meets, but professional greats graced it too. Gerd Müller, George Best and Gordon Banks turned out for the Strikers in the late 1970s. Pelé scored there for the New York Cosmos in 1977, and was reacquainted with Banks afterthat famous savein the 1970 World Cup.Now, after an up-and-down season under Javier Mascherano, today’s great hero, Messi, has the chance to give the Chase Stadium era the perfect send-off. If Inter Miami reachMLSCup and face a lower-ranked team, the game would be played in Fort Lauderdale.It’s why the team aren’t leaning too much into Saturday. They are hosting their annual fan appreciation night and saying, ‘we’ll see you in the playoffs.’ A win against Atlanta could seal homefield advantage for a final run in Broward County.Fort Lauderdale may not be a bustling hub like Miami itself, but it’s accessible to all three of south Florida’s counties – Broward, Palm Beach to the north and Miami-Dade to the south.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Broward and Palm Beach fans formed the bedrock during the leaner pre-Messi years. Naturally, Inter Miami want to retain them.The road traffic is the road traffic, but the club says the 2.5 miles of new roadways serving Miami Freedom Park will be among the most extensive for a new US stadium in decades. The club says the 5,000 new parking spaces will be the most at an MLS stadium.For Lionel Messi and Inter Miami MLS Cup, not league success, rules allRead moreCommunal transport may be slightly easier than it is now. Across the street at the airport is the Tri-Rail station, serving all south Florida, and the localised Metro-Rail and Miami Mover options.Tri-Rail offers affordable trains through Broward and into Palm Beach via 17 stops, but timetable adjustments would be needed to fully support games. The club may yet renew an agreement with the high-speed train company Brightline to bus supporters in from the downtown Miami hub. However, the current lack of clarity is leaving some fans feeling left out of the conversation.“The club have given us the cold shoulder about everything regarding Miami Freedom Park,” says Abad, who lives between Chase Stadium and Miami Freedom Park. “They’ve asked for zero input. The liaisons between the club and the supporters’ groups have not interacted with us at all in that capacity.”“My friends who support New York City FC have been included in every aspect of the new stadium build, including where the supporter groups are going to be seated. Their club looks for opinions and advice. Meanwhile, these guys can’t even tell us if they’re going to have a transport agreement with Brightline or the Tri-Rail.”Inter Miami aren’t waving goodbye to Broward County entirely. The stadium will continue to host major events. The training ground, club HQ, and youth academy will remain within the complex. Beckham has pledged to create a women’s team under the club’s banner, which could bring a new and lasting footballing legacy to the stadium.And while the memories of this era are fond, most fans we spoke to are enthused by the move. “Get me into a proper bowl already. I think everyone’s going to love it,” said Abad.Attendance has sagged a little now everyone who wanted to see Messi has done so. Reported figures remain high, but the naked eye tells a different story. There are plenty of empty seats. Primary market tickets are still available in almost every section for Saturday’s game.“Fort Lauderdale is a great city, but there’s a different energy in Miami,” Zamek adds. “This is a Miami team, it belongs in Miami.”Explore more on these topicsInter MiamiMLSLionel MessiUS sportsMiamiFloridafeaturesShareReuse this content"

There must also be laughter to accompany reflection.No sane observer could claim Steve Clarke’s team deserved to prevail here. Lewis Ferguson and Lyndon Dykes sealed the win. Dick Turpin sprang to mind. Someone, somewhere appears to be smiling on Scotland’s bid to play in a World Cup for the first time since 1998. The Scots, who had just 31% possession, are now in an excellent position in Group C. A playoff spot could be secured on Sunday evening, when Belarus visit Glasgow.Greece, who next travel to Denmark, need snookers.England v Wales: international football friendly – liveRead more“Football is a 90-minute game and you have to make sure you come out of it with a positive result,” said Clarke. “Maybe 3-1 flatters us but we did enough to win the game. It is a big win for us. Results are the only thing that qualify you for a tournament.”Assessment of this Scotland team is not particularly easy. This game actually summed that up. Euphoria swept the country as Clarke led his men to the last European Championship. Epic disappointment was not only the theme in Germany but again as the Scots returned for Nations League action. Scotland rallied impressively in that group before comprehensive defeat by Greece in a playoff. Four points out of a possible six when Scotland began their World Cup campaign represented fine return and enhanced the mood around the national side once again.Greece’s performance in swaggering to a 3-0 win in Glasgowin March meant Scotland should have been forewarned and forearmed.Greece handed Scotland a boost by leaving Konstantinos Karetsas on the bench, with the outstanding attacker recovering from illness. The visitors should, though, have been ahead inside eight minutes. Tasos Bakasetas played a delightful ball across the face of goal, with Vangelis Pavlidis inexplicably failing to tap home.Greece tormented their hosts in wide areas during the opening exchanges. Although that brought no tangible reward, the atmosphere was noticeably flat for that first half hour. Scotland offered no threat whatsoever, a scenario due largely to the intensity of the Greek press. “We had to dig in,” said Clarke.View image in fullscreenRyan Christie jumps for joy after equalising for Scotland barely two minutes after Greece had taken a deserved second-half lead.Photograph: Ian MacNicol/Getty ImagesThe manager resisted what must have been a strong temptation to implement change during the break. Ben Gannon-Doak, brought into the team to supply ammunition from the left side, had been peripheral. Scotland’s first-half XG was 0.06. In fairness to the manager, his bench was not rich in game-altering talent.Within 90 seconds of the restart, Pavlidis had another opportunity; this time he headed over from eight yards. Hampden moaned and groaned. The frustration turned to audible anger as Giorgos Masouras shanked Greece’s next chance over the crossbar. Scotland, a team seeking to create history, still had not had a meaningful attempt at goal.Scotland’s first change was an enforced one. Aaron Hickey, who has endured a horrible time with injury, pulled up. The Brentford full-back could last no longer than the 58th minute. As Anthony Ralston replaced Hickey, Clarke also took the opportunity to introduce Billy Gilmour for Gannon-Doak. The switch was not met positively in the stands, with Gannon-Doak not amused either. Gilmour’s arrival with a view to earning at least a modicum of midfield control was perfectly sensible.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Neat interplay between Christos Tzolis and Bakasetas preceded a Pavlidis shot that was blocked by John Souttar. Kostas Tsimikas pounced on the rebound to find the back of Angus Gunn’s net. Now, Scotland were under serious pressure.Their response was barely in keeping with anything that came before. Greece failed to deal with a corner, with Grant Hanley’s header back into the penalty area only half cleared by Ntinos Mavropanos. This time it was Ryan Christie who collected a loose ball to restore parity. Scotland survived a lengthy check by the video assistant referee for offside.Che Adams latched on to Gilmour free-kick but fluffed his lines. With 15 minutes to play, this was an end-to-end contest. Ferguson fired high into the net after Greece made a mess of dealing with an inswinging Andy Robertson free-kick. This was Ferguson’s first international goal. Equally significant was Gunn producing an outstanding save to deny Karetsas. Dykes added gloss after an all-time howler from Kostas Tzolakis in the Greece goal. Scottish celebration contrasted with understandably bemused Greek faces. What a weird old night.Explore more on these topicsWorld Cup 2026 qualifiersScotlandGreecematch reportsShareReuse this content"

Why wouldn’t that affect them?Max RushdenWe know so little about players’ personal feelings. It means everyone’s analysis of the game is fundamentally superficialThu 9 Oct 2025 09.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 9 Oct 2025 15.08 EDTShareAcouple of weeks ago, Liverpool were on course to win the Premier League for the second season running and probably the Champions League too. After ManchesterCity briefly won the title on the opening daywhen Tijjani Reijnders tore Wolves apart, the Reds’ run of winning without being that good made it feel inevitable. Winning when not at your best is, after all, a sign (™) of a title-winning side, Clive.But thenLiverpoolcontinued playing not particularly well and started losing. At the same time the perennially second-placed high-performance cowards Arsenal have an excellent defence and at least two very good players in every position. Arise Sir Mikel.Diogo Jota gave Liverpool fans goals and a glorious song. He will never be forgotten | Sachin NakraniRead moreIt is almost as if things can change during a season. It really would be better all round to wait until it is finished and review everything then. But that would be a very long podcast. Gary Neville and Jamie Carragher might get through a couple of pairs of thick white-soled pundit shoes by the time they had broken everything down on the one episode of MondayTuesdayWednesday Night Football at the end of May.Do three defeats in succession constitute a crisis? As with any football debate it depends entirely on your definition of the key word in the sentence. Is Paul Scholes world class? What do you mean by world class? Are Aston Villa a big club? What does big mean? Are Manchester United back? OK, well, we know the answer to that one.But for a club of Liverpool’s size, given how good they were last season, mini-crisis seems about right. On TalkSport last week beforethe Chelsea game, I asked their former striker Neil Mellor how many defeats in a row before he starts panicking. He replied six. For the record, we are halfway towards a Neil Mellor panic.How that manifests itself we will have to see. But if you see a genial blond 42-year-old man running around Alderley Edge Waitrose (just an educated guess) screaming at a Charlie Bigham lasagne, you’ll know Liverpool have lost to Manchester United, Eintracht Frankfurt and Brentford.There are clear problems. Trying to incorporate Florian Wirtz, who you can tell is such a delightful player, has imbalanced the midfield. Those who watch a lot of the Bundesliga (ie Archie Rhind-Tutt and Lars Sivertsen) will tell you that Wirtz is a touch player, who makes those around him better. He links the play effortlessly, as opposed to “grabbing the game by the scruff of the neck”.This is clearly more difficult if you’re not used to the players around you. Milos Kerkez and Jeremie Frimpong are different footballers to Andy Robertson and Trent Alexander-Arnold.There are also a number of players who shone last season who are not performing as well: Mo Salah, Ibrahima Konaté, Alexis Mac Allister, Conor Bradley. In fact, almost all of them. There is one glaring thing all these people have endured in the very recent past –the death of Diogo Jota.View image in fullscreenMohamed Salah has not performed at the same standard as last season for Liverpool.Photograph: David Klein/Action Images/ReutersIt is just over three months since they lost their friend. While the news cycle moves on so fast and our pie chart of compassion that we reserve for beyond our own bubble focused on that for a few days before going back to Gaza, Ukraine, ICE, the Manchester terror attack, etc, etc, all the while these guys are going to work and their mate isn’t there.It is impossible to know how each Liverpool player and staff member is feeling on any given day and there is a great deal of projection. Perhaps Salah didn’t track back against Chelsea because he couldn’t be bothered or he was tired. But possibly his form is just a few per cent down because he misses his pal.It was interesting to hear Enzo Maresca talking before the Chelsea-Liverpool game about the loss of his teammate Antonio Puerta at Sevilla, who had a cardiac arrest on the pitch in a game against Getafe in August 2007 and died in hospital three days later at the age of 22.“The way they are doing this season is fantastic,” Chelsea’s head coach said. “Especially after Jota’s tragedy. I live exactly the same when I was a player 20 years ago.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

So you have to be very strong. And this is the reason why for me they are doing not good, even better than good. Because they are trying to deal with a problem that is not easy.”On The Anfield Wrap, Craig Hannan summed it up very well: “They’re still going to be reminded when they hear the song on 20 minutes, when they walk into the dressing room and there’s no one under his hanger. Even during games there’s going to moments when they play a ball and think: ‘Ah well Diogo …’ If Salah’s cried six games ago in front of the Kop it means that just everything isn’t all right now.”View image in fullscreenLiverpool fans hold up a banner in tribute to Diogo Jota.Photograph: Robbie Jay Barratt/AMA/Getty ImagesI have come to believe over the course of covering football for a couple of decades that there is a fundamental superficiality to everyone’s analysis of the game. We do not know how any individual is feeling at any given time and what effect that is having on their performance. Jota’s death is one of the starkest examples. We know something terrible happened and we understand what grief is. Beyond that is the intangible level to which this is affecting different people at the club. There is a high chance some of the players themselves don’t really know its effect at any given time.How the media cover this and how fans dissect performances are clearly not hugely important. At a practical level, if you bring up Jota’s death, it is hard to do it in 10 seconds and then move on to Dominik Szoboszlai’s difficulties at right-back. Beyond this tragedy and beyond Liverpool, it would sound bizarre to caveat every criticism of every player with an admission that we know so little about them, be it their relationship with their parents, if they are going through IVF, if their marriage is breaking down or whatever.The Guardian Football Weekly regular Nedum Onuoha was on Radio 5 Live the other day talking about how his mother’s death halfway through his career affected his love of the game. “I didn’t enjoy football as much. Some of the highs and the lows that come with it didn’t really feel the same any more.” And that’s half a career; with Jota and Liverpool right now, it is three months.So whatever they achieve, if it’s something or if it’s nothing, even if we don’t mention it every time we discuss their games, even if it isn’t the reason they go on to do whatever they go on to do, we should not forget that a few weeks ago they lost not just a brilliant footballer, but more importantly, they lost a friend.Explore more on these topicsLiverpoolDiogo JotacommentShareReuse this content"

But the priority is on-field success; there is an awareness at boardroom level that it is the principal driver for everything.Clubs target groundbreaking £4.3bn TV rights deal for European football competitionsRead moreThe 17th-placed Premier League finish last season was a disaster and the target for Frank is to return the team to the top five, mainly for sporting reasons, but also to drive revenue streams and keep the club’s value high.Frank was permitted to spend about £125m on players this summer – most notablyMohammed KudusandXavi Simons– with the club also committed to paying combined fees of about £50m to make the deals for Kevin Danso andMathys Telpermanent.Frank has started well – Spurs are third – and will be backed in January if the right signings are available at the right prices. The usual disclaimer about the mid-season window being a difficult time to add to the squad applies.The equity injection has come from the Lewis family fortune and put it into Spurs via their investment vehicle, Enic. A source close to the family said: “This is initial additional funding. As the club’s management decides what’s needed to deliver success, more money will be available. The Lewis family is committed to backing the club to be successful.”The Lewis family and the rest of the Spurs executive tier maintain the club is not for sale. Spurs have been stalked by takeover talk for a long time and it has intensified since the former chairDaniel Levy was oustedin early September. The club have rejectedexpressions of interestfrom three groups. One was Amanda Staveley’s PCP International Finance; another a consortium of investors led by Dr Roger Kennedy and Wing-Fai Ng through Firehawk Holdings Limited; andthe thirdcame from a United States-based consortium led by the tech entrepreneur Brooklyn Earick.Spurs said the £100m would “further strengthen the club’s financial position and equip the leadership team with additional resources to continue the focus on driving long-term sporting success.

That’s whatI missed, the adrenaline and addiction to competing. I spent years trying to find that feeling again.“I ran a couple of marathons and I did all sorts of things trying to hunt that feeling down, but I had to get it into my mind that I’m never going to have that feeling again in the same way. I had to teach myself to say: ‘Listen, you’re not going to get that back, so stop trying to find it.’ Once I got there, then I could move myself forward.”More cameras, top pundits but Disney’s Champions League adventure is a work in progress | Tom GarryRead moreChapman won a WSL title with Chelsea and two FA Cups before she ended a 22-year career that began with her debut for Millwall Lionesses in 1996 at the age of 14. She was a critical component in Arsenal’s 2006-07 quadruple-winning team, having joined from Charlton in 2006, and won 13 major trophies with the Gunners during two spells before signing for Chelsea.She is lacing up her boots again, for the second time in six and a half months, to take part inChelsea’s legends match against Liverpoolat Stamford Bridge on Saturday, having become the first woman to play for the Blues in the reverse fixture at Anfield. All proceeds from the game will go to the Chelsea FC Foundation and Chelsea Players’ Trust – two wings of the club Chapman is keen to support having found her step away from playing tough.View image in fullscreenKatie Chapman is thrown into the air by her Chelsea teammates after her final game in 2018.Photograph: Nigel French/PALaura Cordingley, the CEO of the Chelsea Foundation, helps drive the work to support current and former players. “We have a huge duty of care towards those that have come before, not least because it’s really important to the club, but also from a foundation perspective, because our players and past players are so inspirational to the next generation of young people coming through,” she says. “Players can help us support the right narratives with young people too, with those who may or may not make it as professional football players.”The support is wide-ranging and for any player who has stepped through the doors in Cobham, be it for 10 years or one day. “It doesn’t matter when they may need support or what it looks like, we will be there for them,” Cordingley says.“What we really want to make sure is that we’re not overlapping. We work closely with the player care team in the academy and we make sure we’re greater than the sum of our parts. One of the first things we do is go to the PFA [Professional Footballers’ Association] and ask what support they have available. Then we look at how we can be additive to that. It’s about how we bring all the right people together to create the right package of support.”The WSL title race bursts into life – Women’s Football WeeklyRead moreChapman, who does many things including working as a pre- and postnatal personal trainer and co-hosting a grassroots football podcast, became a women’s ambassador for Chelsea after retiring, which was a lifeline, but she struggled. “It’s really tough,” she says. “I had a mortgage to pay and I had kids to look after and I did need to jump from one job to another. I didn’t have the time to breathe. I was lucky that Chelsea took me on as an ambassador that helped me with that gap between things.“I had a lot of anxiety for many years. When you’re an athlete you don’t show weakness – struggling is a weakness – and it’s hard sometimes for you to put yourself out there and ask for help and ask what help’s available. It took me quite a long time to come to terms with that and think: ‘I do need help, I do need support and it’s not a weakness.’“I had counselling through the Professional Footballers’ Association when I hadcome to terms with the fact that I was really struggling. Back then there was support available, but did we really know it was there and have access to it? Not really. Did we understand what was available? Not really. I think that’s got better over the years.”Losing the structure and routine of professional football is “a big part of it”, she says. “You know what you’re doing on a daily basis, what you’re doing with your body, what training looks like, what meetings look like. Everything’s managed for you. There’s also an identity piece as well. You come out and you’re like: ‘Who am I?’”View image in fullscreenKatie Chapman stretches to make a challenge against France at the 2015 World Cup.Photograph: Steve Bardens/Fifa/Getty ImagesChapman had another part of her life to fall back on. As a mother of three she slotted into being mum instead of professional player. “I dived into that and I’m grateful for that because I could have ended up in a different space,” the former Chelsea captain says. “Regardless of whether we think we’re ready for the next stage or not, the impact is massive. When I talk to a lot of people, not just in football, but around any sport, it’s the same.”The risk is that athletes stepping back from their sports, searching for new purpose and obsession, can find it in dark places. “It can become really dangerous,” says Chapman. “I came out of football and I was like: ‘Oh my God, I understand why people go off the rails and they go in all kinds of different directions and potentially find an addiction somewhere else.’ It is because you’re searching for that adrenaline piece, that feeling you got from competing, and we can all go different ways with that.”That is why she cares about the work being done to support players and is taking part in the legends match. That, and she would struggle to pass up an opportunity to play. “I love it. It makes me feel alive again and puts a smile on my face. It also gives me a rewarding feeling. Finding work that I love and that gives me a rewarding feeling is what matters most.”View image in fullscreenKatie Chapman says “When you’re an athlete you don’t show weakness – struggling is a weakness.”Photograph: Graeme Robertson/The GuardianOld habits die hard. “It’s funny, my mindset is that if I’m going to do these things, I have to be good,” says Chapman. “I train myself to be in the right condition. My mindset hasn’t changed in that sense. TI’m going out there representing women, women’s football.“If I want to keep pushing women’s football forward, I need to be in the right place and the right mindset to go into that game and give the best I possibly can.”Get in touchIf you have any questions or comments about any of our newsletters please emailmoving.goalposts@theguardian.com.This is an extract from our free weekly email, Moving the Goalposts.

With the streaming platform embarking on a five-year deal, the tournament is in intriguing territory with a paywall, and audiences will be hoping for someDisney+magic to justify their subscriptions.Football-wise, whether it was Barcelona’s masterpiece,Twente holding Chelseaor Melchie Dumornay’s second goalarrowing past the Arsenal defence, the entertainment level was thankfully more Mulan than Mulan II, but could the same be said about the coverage?Baltimore penalty spares Chelsea blushes after Twente threaten WCL shockRead moreIn terms of broadcasting the on-pitch action, there was a noticeable uplift with a minimum of six cameras covering every match, double the minimum under the previous rights deal with Dazn. It is some way off the dozens of angles often available for men’s Champions League ties but a step in the right direction. It meant that when Cecilia Salvai headed Juventus level against Benfica in the first half of Disney’s first game replays showed four angles, accompanied by the words of a polished Jacqui Oatley and Anita Asante.That commentary duo were among several good examples of what Disney appears to have nailed. It has chosen on-air talent with knowledge and professionalism that give the coverage credibility, with experienced broadcasters such as Lucy Ward, Lianne Sanderson and Vicki Sparks on a long list of strong names. Seeing Jeanette Kwakye, the lead presenter of BBC Sport’s world athletics championship last month and another top operator, presenting live from Leigh Sports Village added to the feeling Disney has recruited well.That said, it looks rather jarring when these presenting teams are standing pitchside with a fairly meagre-looking table rather than in a shiny, newly designed studio that some might have hoped for in this new dawn. For the Arsenal v OL Lyonnes game at Boreham Wood, for example, Alex Scott and Fara Williams – another top-tier presentation team – had people repeatedly walking behind them during their analysis.View image in fullscreenCecilia Salvai, of Juventus, after scoring against Benfica, a goal that Disney+ was able to show from four different angles.Photograph: Diego Puletto/Juventus FC/Getty ImagesSome may feel it adds to the sense of “being there”, but to others it will have looked somewhat tacky. It feels as if the casting crew secured Tom Hanks and Ellen DeGeneres as voiceover artists, but the animation does not quite match that calibre yet, although it is understood Disney will have a studio show for December’s programme in match week six, when all 18 teams will play simultaneously.The scale of Disney’s task on match nights is vast and the ambition is to be applauded. Every game has a pitchside presenting team, with 20 minutes of buildup and half an hour of post-match reaction. It is not hard to understand why that would have been an appealing message of equality for Uefa; the same resources given to every league phase fixture, whether it is St Pölten or Barcelona.Viewers around Europe may have been a tad disappointed that the pitchside presentation was only in English, but there will be multi-language pitch presentations for the knockout stages. An impressive array of languages is already served. For example, from a device in the UK, Barcelona’s 7-1 win over Bayern Munich can be rewatched – in full – in English, Spanish, German, Danish and Polish and Lyonnes’ 2-1 win over Arsenal can be watched in Dutch, Norwegian and Swedish as well as English and French.

The short buildup for a huge game such as the defending champions hosting the eight-time winners felt a slight shame. It meant there were no recorded packages, no Gabriel Clarke-esque voiceovers, no dramatic montages. No deep, meaningful sit-down interviews filmed in a dark room with Chloe Kelly.CBS has set an impressive bar on the other side of the Atlantic. Its slick coverage had a world-class look and feel akin to its men’s Champions League coverage, in a great studio where it can get the best out of guests such as Kelley O’Hara and Jen Beattie.It would be harsh to accuse Disney of cutting corners. Sending presenting teams to every match will not be cheap, but with commentary teams off-tube it feels as if its priorities are the wrong way round. Also, the lack of a dedicated post-match interviewer meant that Scott was doing the interviews at Arsenal away from the presenting table, leaving Sparks to vamp for an unusually long time after the final whistle – she held the fort well.At other games there were momentary glitches or slightly awkward pauses. The pitchside duo covering Tuesday’s opener at Turin’s Allianz Stadium, Ben Haines and the former England striker Ellen White, were slick, insightful and knowledgable in their half-time analysis – but only once the feed joined them. At half-time viewers were initially treated to a view of the pitch sprinklers and replays of the goals without commentary, before Haines’s and White’s analysis. Those were teething problems the technical team will surely resolve before the second round of matches next Wednesday and Thursday.The biggest long-term gains may come through other means: social mediavideos of Millie Brightforgetting the stars of Grey’s Anatomy while trying to do keepy-uppies provide the kind of cultural crossover Uefa will hope attracts more fans and grow the sport. As far as that plot line goes, there is a long way left in this story.Explore more on these topicsWomen's Champions LeagueDisney+Women's footballanalysisShareReuse this content"

We couldn’t score the fourth and fifth ones. The stadium was silent. We didn’t get any energy back from the stands. We did everything to win.“What more can you give in 20 minutes? We didn’t let them escape. If you hear justWalesfans for half an hour, it’s sad because the team deserved more support today.“I stand by this statement. We cannot do more than being 3-0 in a derby. I would have wished for a bit more support in phases where it gets difficult.“In the second half to get behind us, there was a bit too much support for Wales. It could have helped us to regain energy, but it is what it is and that is it.”Away from risking a fight with supporters, Tuchel has also caused a stir by omitting Jude Bellingham and Phil Foden from his squad. But the decision was justified by Rogers impressing again in the No 10 position and scoring his first international goal. “He is what he is,” Tuchel said. “He is a No 10 and he is competing for his place.”Craig Bellamy hopes that Wales, who host Belgium in a crucial World Cup qualifier on Monday, learn from their awful first-half display.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Baxter, however, believes rugby should be primarily focused on improving its existing competitions.Senior rugby figures believe rebel R360 league all but dead after unions’ statementRead more“We don’t want the best players in the competition not playing for us or the teams playing against us,” said Baxter, who takes his unbeaten Chiefs side to Bristol on Saturday. “I want us to be attractive to players like Len Ikitau and [fellow Wallaby signing] Tom Hooper and for them to think they’re playing in a frontline competition.“For me we’ve got a very good competition here. Our responsibility is to improve the product we’ve got. Another competition doesn’t create more interest, creating a better game does. Throwing in other competitions might feel like a great fix [but] I don’t know that it is because the game still has to be attractive for people to come and watch.”Ikitau, 27, who has signed for Exeter for this season, has made clear he wants to represent the Wallabies at the 2027 Rugby World Cup but Baxter accepts a lucrative R360 deal might be attractive to some older players. “Is it an opportunity for a group of players post their international careers? Potentially. But I don’t know if that’s what’s going to make it an attractive competition.“I know we’re hearing all sorts of things about why it might be good for players because of fewer games and player welfare. It’s almost like they’re ignoring the huge travel issues. There won’t be any training bases, is it going to be a transient medical setup? All the details around that part of things are very loose.”View image in fullscreenAustralia centre Len Ikitau is one of the marquee signings for the new Prem season, the kind of player who could be lured by the new R360 league.Photograph: Colin Murty/AFP/Getty ImagesBaxter, meanwhile, believes the Prem has the potential to become an even better product following an unsettling period dominated by concerns around how best to minimise head injuries. “We had a big panic on, didn’t we, and tried to remove the physicality and gladiatorial element almost entirely from the game.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Obviously a lot of firepower in his game. He played a good game,” Djokovic said. “I was a little bit too passive. Just very challenging conditions these days for all the players. Just trying to stay alive on the court and glad to overcome this hurdle.”In the opening set, Bergs showed remarkable resilience by saving five set points to frustrate Djokovic, before the Serbian finally closed it out with an unreturned serve. The second set proved even more gruelling, with both players serving well but treating the crowd to breathtaking rallies that left Djokovic hunched over his racquet on several occasions.The highlight came during one extraordinary rally where the fourth seed gave Bergs five golden opportunities to seal the point with overhead shots and volleys at the net, only to somehow emerge victorious and bring the crowd to its feet. Djokovic eventually sealed victory on his third match point, advancing to face Vacherot in what promises to be an intriguing semi-final clash. “Amazing story for him. This tournament has taken out top players of the world … it’s really impressive what he’s doing,” Djokovic said on his next opponent.Vacherot pulled off a huge upset, stunning the 10th seed, Holger Rune, 2-6, 7-6 (4), 6-4 to become the second-lowest ranked player ever to reach an ATP Masters semi-final. The Monégasque qualifier’s remarkable run will see him crack the top 100 next week after spending half of last year sidelined with injury, but even playing in Shanghai was a question mark when he arrived.View image in fullscreenValentin Vacherot after defeating Holger Rune.Photograph: Andy Wong/AP“I didn’t even come as a qualifier, I came as an alternate. I wasn’t sure to even play the qualifier,” Vacherot said. “Coming back from six months out is always not easy. You cannot just come back and win tournaments right and left. You’ve just got to fight your way through a little bit.”Vacherot’s stunning journey in Shanghai, which now includes wins over four seeds, looked doomed early on as Rune raced through a physically demanding opening set while the underdog felt his “lungs were screaming”. But the tide turned dramatically in the second-set tiebreak when Vacherot produced a stunning backhand crosscourt winner to take a 5-4 lead.Rune crashed his next shot into the net and could only watch as Vacherot fired a forehand winner down the line on set point to level the match. Rune struggled physically in the decider, requiring the trainer twice to massage his leg. Vacherot then capitalised to complete a memorable victory in a contest lasting a minute shy of three hours.“It would mean a lot to play at least one of the guys of the ‘Big Three’ in my career,” Vacherot said on playing Djokovic. Vacherot’s cousin, Arthur Rinderknech, is also in the quarter-finals, with the Frenchman set to play Félix Auger-Aliassime on Friday.Aryna Sabalenka and Elena Rybakina, meanwhile, will renew their rivalry in the quarter-finals of the Wuhan Open.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSport in FocusFree weekly newsletterSign up to Sport in FocusEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Cybersecurity experts have warned of a risk that some providers of such checks, which can require government IDs, are becoming hacker targets with bad actors aware of the high volume of sensitive data.“Recently, we discovered an incident where an unauthorised party compromised one of Discord’s third-party customer service providers,” Discord said in a statement. “The unauthorised party then gained access to information from a limited number of users who had contacted Discord through our customer support and/or trust and safety teams … Of the accounts impacted globally, we have identified approximately 70,000 users that may have had government ID photos exposed, which our vendor used to review age-related appeals.”Discord required people who needed to prove their age to get back on to the platform to upload an image of their photo ID and Discord username.Nathan Webb, a principal consultant at the UK digital security company Acumen Cyber, said the breach was “very concerning”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

There is an urgent need for long-term thinking and workforce investment, alongside investment in AI tools, to ensure sustainable and productive employment.”In addition, two-fifths (39%) of leaders said entry-level roles had already been reduced or cut as a result of efficiencies made by using AI tools to conduct research or carry out administrative and briefing tasks.While more than half of respondents said they felt lucky to have started their career before the use of AI became widespread, just over half (53%) also said they believed that the benefits of AI implementation in companies would outweigh the disruption to the workforce.AI is being rapidly adopted by UK businesses, according to the business leaders surveyed, and three-quarters (76%) said they expect new tools to deliver tangible benefits to their organisations within the next 12 months.Businesses said they were mainly investing in AI to improve productivity and efficiency, as well as cutting costs and filling skills gaps.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Photograph: Win McNamee/Getty ImagesSaudi Arabia’s investment in Twitter increased its influence in Silicon Valley while being used at home to shut down critics of the regimeByJacob SilvermanThu 9 Oct 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 9 Oct 2025 05.38 EDTShareAli al-Ahmed didn’t think thatElon Muskwas responsible for the decline and fall of Twitter. Musk was another face representing an old regime. And its sins began well before Musk bumbled into Twitter HQ, in October 2022, carrying a porcelain sink. (In an attempt at humour, Musk posted a video of himself arriving at the Twitter offices carrying a sink with the caption “Entering Twitter HQ – let that sink in!”)Ahmed was a Saudi journalist and analyst living in the Washington DC area. He was a founder of the Institute for Gulf Affairs (formerly the Saudi Institute), a Saudi-focused thinktank with an emphasis on human rights reporting, and was the kind of expert – passionate, principled, always glad to hop on the phone – that journalists loved having in their digital Rolodex.For Ahmed, who over the years had many family members imprisoned by the Saudi royal family, the pursuit of human rights was a solemn task. But he also had a kind of garrulousness – breaking into asides about his children or the talking gadget he’d invented to remind them to wash their hands – that reminded one of the deeper human stakes. “Twitter is no different from Boeing or those military companies,” Ahmed told me. “They care about making money. Twitter and Facebook are not champions or models for human rights. These people are nothing but money-grubbers.” Twitter had banned Ahmed’s Arabic-language Twitter account, which had 36,000 followers (although he was allowed to keep his English-language account).I first spoke to Ahmed in 2021, when reporting on the Saudi government’s use of Twitter to unmask and arrest people posting critically about the regime. For Saudi authorities, Twitter was an asset in every sense. The billionaire Saudi businessman Prince Alwaleed bin Talal was Twitter’s largest outside shareholder, and the site had become a key tool in the government’s apparatus of surveillance and control.Ahmed believed his Twitter account had been compromised. He worried that spies had access to it, which would endanger dissident Saudis with whom he exchanged private messages. This wasn’t an idle concern. One of his contacts wasAbdulrahman al-Sadhan, an aid worker who, in 2018, was abducted by Saudi security forces for running a satirical Twitter account that parodied members of the government. Abdulrahman, who was then 37, was sentenced to 20 years in prison.Saudi Arabia is carrying out more repression than ever, said Abdulrahman’s sister Areej al-Sadhan, who lived in the US when we spoke in 2021. In the first three years after her brother was arrested, her family had received only two brief phone calls from him. Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman, had zero tolerance for dissent or mockery. Areej has not heard from her brother for years. In a 2023 court filing, she said that she wasn’t sure if her brother was alive.Despite his attempt to portray himself as a modernising reformer, Prince Mohammed could appear every bit as repressive as past Saudi rulers, turning the country into a surveillance state where arbitrary arrests and disappearances were routine. As the brutal murder of Washington Post journalistJamal Khashoggidemonstrated, the Saudi state pursued vigorous methods of transnational repression, allegedly sending hit squads after enemies abroad.Prince Mohammed used his country’s bottomless reserves of oil and capital to flood Silicon Valley, politics, sports leagues and other power centres with cash and influence. Venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz and Peter Thiel’s investment vehicle, Founders Fund, were among the most notable recipients of Saudi money, but they were just two among hundreds. In 2016,Uber received an astonishing $3.5bnfrom Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund (PIF).Blackstone’s infrastructure fund got $20bn. By autumn 2018,the Wall Street Journal reported, Saudi Arabia had become “the largest single funding source for US startups”.The Saudi-Silicon Valley relationship represented a convergence of shared interests. Saudi Arabia, like other Gulf dictatorships, wanted to wash its money, diversify its investments, deepen influence with its most powerful ally, extend soft power and counter its image as a repressive state responsible for a devastating war in Yemen. Silicon Valley offered all of that, along with access to cutting-edge technology and a business elite coming into its own.“They’re surveillance states. They’re police states,” said Nader Hashemi, a professor of Middle East and Islamic politics at Georgetown University. “They want to use the latest technology in order to continue to remain in power and surveil their populations. So they have another interest in trying to sort of be the beneficiaries of hi-tech developments, hoping that that will help them internally with their own political rule.”The Saudi government had vast assets held in the names of senior members of the royal family. Through his Kingdom Holding Company, Prince Alwaleed had interests in businesses like Lyft and Snapchat. And until Elon Musk came along, he was Twitter’s largest outside shareholder. As Saudi Arabia became the pre-eminent source of Silicon Valley capital, Alwaleed emerged as the country’s most recognisable mogul, taking the role of leading shareholder in Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp. By 2015, the prince owned an estimated 5.2% of Twitter. In November 2017,Alwaleed was arrestedand confined to the Ritz-Carlton Hotel in Riyadh as part of a sweeping “anti-corruption” purge that forced numerous wealthy Saudis and members of the royal family to sign over their assets to Prince Mohammed. That may well have included Alwaleed’s Twitter shares.“Since late 2017 or January of 2018, Prince Mohammed has exercised control over more Twitter stock than is owned by Twitter’s founder,” according to a civil complaint filed against Twitter and the consulting firm McKinsey by Omar Abdulaziz, a film director and Saudi exile. Abdulaziz said that the consultancy helped finger him as a prominent online dissident, leading to his Twitter account being hacked. (In 2020, Canadian authorities warned Abdulaziz that he was a target of a Saudi kill team.) According to Abdulaziz’s original complaint, “Because of the tremendous wealth of key figures in [the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia], major corporations have enabled, collaborated with, and turned a blind eye to [its] efforts to suppress, torture, falsely imprison, terrorise and murder dissenters both within Saudi Arabia and around the world.” Twitter had given the Saudi government a reach well beyond its borders.At the outset, Twitter had seemed like “a great equaliser”, said Ahmed. With no independent media in Saudi Arabia and most political expression forbidden, Twitter and other social media seemed initially a place for people to speak more frankly, especially when they could be pseudonymous. “That did not last,” he told me.By the second Obama administration, Saudi Twitter had become a place for the kingdom’s rulers to propagandise, track dissident thought and identify victims for Prince Mohammed’s personal team of enforcers. Many Saudis knew better than to post on Twitter under their real names. But the Saudi government was able to unmask pseudonymous accounts and trace their owners, who were then arrested. For a long time, dissident Saudis wondered how exactly government security forces had unmasked their friends and family members, and whether there were any countermeasures they could take. They assumed the Saudi government had access to the finest western security contractors and advanced spyware software. They didn’t yet know that Prince Mohammed and his henchmen had something better: a spy ring inside Twitter itself.In June 2014, a Saudi official named Bader Al Asaker took a tour of Twitter’s San Francisco headquarters. Asaker was the secretary-general of Prince Mohammed’s personal charity, the Misk Foundation, and head of the crown prince’s private office. One of the people who arranged the tour was a Twitter employee namedAhmad Abouammo. According to US prosecutors,Asaker was grooming Abouammo, who worked on media partnerships in the Middle East, to spy for him. In the months to come, Abouammo would receive more than $100,000 in cash and gifts as he gathered information – including email addresses, phone numbers and private messages – relating to Saudi dissidents, journalists and other accounts of note.View image in fullscreen‘Let that sink in’ … Elon Musk takes over Twitter on 26 October 26 2022.Photograph: Twitter account of Elon Musk/AFP/Getty ImagesAbouammo got a new job at Amazon the following year, but the Saudi regime found a worthy replacement in Ali Alzabarah, a Twitter engineer whose position and technical skills gave him access to more user data than Abouammo. Soon enough, Alzabarah became an even more productive spy for Asaker and the Saudi regime, tracking dissidents across borders and providing IP addresses that could reveal people’s locations.In December 2015, an FBI agent visited the Twitter headquarters in San Francisco to tell them that they had a Saudi espionage problem. The FBI asked that Twitter refrain from taking immediate action but, reportedly suspicious about the intentions of government security agencies, which are known to pressure tech companies for private user information, Twitter decided to suspend Alzabarah.According to a federal indictment against Alzabarah, the engineer turned spy frantically called Asaker, who, along with the Saudi consul general of Los Angeles, helped spirit Alzabarah away to Saudi Arabia. After finding refuge there, Alzabarah was named CEO of the Misk Foundation. Almost a decade later, Alzabarah was still on X – where his account was locked for privacy – and on the FBI’s most-wanted list. Abouammo was arrested inNovember 2019 and indicted. A jury found him guilty on six criminal charges related to his spying. In December 2022, a judge sentenced him to three and a half years in federal prison.Twitter – and nowX, as it was rebranded after Musk’s takeover – has never accounted publicly for the Saudi spy ring, nor has it discussed how it plans to keep foreign agents off its payroll.If Saudi’s ruling class had doubts about Musk’s takeover of Twitter, they were short-lived. After initially criticising the brash Musk, Prince Alwaleed, now free from five-star confinement, supported his takeover effort, announcing he would roll his $1.89bn worth of shares (presumably controlled by Prince Mohammed) into the new venture. Asaker continued to use the site to propagandise to his more than 2.3 million followers.Despite Musk swooping into Twitter HQ with a promise to liberate users from the shackles of Silicon Valley technocrats, the user experience got worse.Meanwhile, Musk seemed openly transactional in his dealings with foreign governments. Whatever universal principles he claimed to hold appeared secondary, in practice, to his business concerns and his personal whims. This free-speech absolutist said nothing about Saudi Arabia’s abuse of his platform. Perhaps he was simply unaware.The company that once called itself “the free speech wing of the free speech party”, was now chasing viability via personal data collection and surveillance advertising. It did not protect its users from data breaches and it made devil’s bargains with foreign governments. As Ali al-Ahmed said, it was a typical US corporation. Except that this one had charged itself with a higher purpose and, in bumbling into foreign markets under autocratic governments where its product basically invited local people to break the law, it set up its users for trouble.View image in fullscreenJamal Khashoggi during a press conference in the Bahraini capital Manama in December 2014.Photograph: Mohammed Al-Shaikh/AFP/Getty ImagesFor Ahmed, the conviction of one Saudi spy, Abouammo, without any larger reckoning over the kingdom’s role at Twitter and in Silicon Valley, was a failure. As possibly the only known victim of the spy ring living in the US, Ahmed had offered to testify at Abouammo’s sentencing. After a video chat with representatives of the Department of Justice, he never heard back. “It was very clear that they were just trying to close this matter,” said Ahmed. “Imagine if this guy was doing it for the Iranians. Oh my God. He would get 20 [years].”He emphasised that, in a lawsuit regarding the murder of Jamal Khashoggi, the Biden administration had recognised Prince Mohammed as having sovereign immunity. The US government also intervened in a lawsuit against Prince Mohammed filed by Saad Aljabri, a former spy chief who had defected to the US. “I really think it was a betrayal of justice here,” said Ahmed. “It’s part of this foreign influence and the corruption that’s also now in the court system.”Twitter’s relationship with the Saudi government revealed how the company really operated. It wasn’t just a place for silly memes or catty media discourse or an attention-obsessed billionaire to cultivate his flock. It was an informational battleground, a crucial node in the broader media ecosystem, and formed part of the connective tissue between Silicon Valley and Gulf dictatorships. It revealed the company’s politics as riddled with the same kind of false populism and political opportunism embraced by Musk, Trump and Maga radicals. Twitter’s willingness to overlook horrific behaviour by a major investor wasn’t unique. It’s the default for most large corporations, the equivalent of a western oil giant paying bribes to operate in a foreign country. But the tech industry had long tried to paint itself as a bearer of progress, where technological innovation was synonymous with human flourishing. Twitter’s Saudi scandal showed that this wasn’t true at all.It’s possible that there were other spies working at Twitter, just as there were likely foreign agents working throughout Silicon Valley. Economic espionage is an old story. But using tech companies’ surveillance-based business model to repress dissent at home and practice transnational repression abroad was a grimly novel phenomenon. It was common for tech companies operating in foreign markets – often with minimal local staff – to face political pressures. In many cases, the result was that formerly idealistic tech firms would make compromises over censorship if it meant having access to tens of millions of users in Turkey, Egypt, Pakistan, India or China. The cybersecurity specialist known by the mononym Mudge, who consulted for Twitter, testified before Congress that India and China had agents working inside Twitter who had broad access to user data.A month after Mudge testified, Elon Musk completed his harried acquisition of Twitter. The $44bn purchase price required him to take on a lot of debt and to solicit support from friends and allies from Hawaii to San Francisco to Riyadh. By buying Twitter, Musk inherited the Saudi spy scandal and the still-unresolved litigation associated with it. He inherited a major shareholder who had committed espionage against their own asset. Yet there was still a lot we didn’t know about Twitter, Saudi Arabia and Musk.I wanted to know more about who helped Musk take Twitter private and who now owned a piece of X. Who was this powerful, volatile billionaire potentially beholden to?It wasn’t something that Musk wanted to talk about. The company had done away with its PR department. In the public imagination, Musk was X – he owned it, he was its most popular user, he set its policies, he intervened personally when one of his favourite accounts encountered issues. He owed nothing to the media. He was enjoying its death throes.When Musk acquired Twitter, he fired thousands of people and, with his blithe disregard for the tenets of employment law, provoked numerous lawsuits. By early 2024, these lawsuits – by ex-employees who said they didn’t receive severance, were coerced into quitting, or were encouraged to break the law in order to implement Musk’s edicts – were winding their way through the courts. In some suits, the plaintiffs wanted X to submit a list of its shareholders to answer questions about accountability. Who were Musk’s partners? Who might be materially affected by a lawsuit against X? Did the judge own shares in Tesla or another Musk company?This was a legitimate concern. In 2023, a liberal media watchdog group, Media Matters, produced a report that accused the site of allowing antisemitic posts next to advertising, and Musk sued them for allegedly manipulating data in an attempt to “destroy” the platform. The suit was filed in a north Texas district where one of the judges turned out to be a Tesla shareholder. US district judgeReed O’Connor owned as muchas $50,000 in Tesla stock when he took on Musk’s lawsuit against Media Matters. Judge O’Connor made a series of rulings in favour of Musk, and the case’s accumulating legal fees led to Media Matters laying off staff. In November 2024, X added a provision to its terms of service stating that all legal disputes would be settled in Judge O’Connor’s Northern District of Texas. (O’Connor ruled that his Tesla stock “is not relevant to the case”, buthe recused himself from X’s caseagainst the World Federation of Advertisers.)View image in fullscreenElon Musk leaves after a bilateral meeting in Riyadh on 13 May 2025 in his role as senior adviser to President Trump.Photograph: Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty ImagesThese kinds of shareholder document requests are common, and a corporate defendant may request to submit the information under seal, making it unavailable to the public (and potentially even the plaintiffs). In one of the cases I followed, Anoke v Twitter, one of the many civil lawsuits resulting from Musk’s chaotic takeover of the company and his mass firings of employees, X submitted a list of shareholders under seal.Wanting to file a motion to have the list unsealed, I reached out to Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press (RCFP), a first amendment organisation that offered pro bono services to journalists. Born out of the Nixon administration’s attempted censorship of the Pentagon Papers, RCFP had a distinguished history of first amendment litigation. They agreed to represent me.Together we found a few cases where it might be possible to unseal X’s shareholders list. The cases varied in their particulars, and some seemed more promising than others. But the public-interest claim was straightforward. The RCFP attorneys deployed precedent-laden arguments about X as a public square, media ownership and foreign influence and national security concerns. They contacted the many high-powered lawyers X was employing to fight these cases to formally let them know we would be filing motions to unseal. And by early July, they had completed the necessary filings. In July 2024, we officially filed a motion in the Northern District of California asking a federal judge to unseal a disclosure list of X’s shareholders in Anoke v Twitter.And then I waited.It had cost about $46.5bn for Elon Musk to acquire Twitter. The money was cobbled together from $20bn in Musk’s assets, $13bn in loans from big banks (which soon found that they couldn’t move them off their books), $6bn in loans to Musk himself, and more than $7bn in commitments from investors who would be shareholders of the new private enterprise.In a financial statement submitted to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in May 2022, Musk listed a number of his planned Twitter co-investors and their equity stakes, so we had some idea of who was helping him buy the company. Saudi Prince Alwaleed, Twitter’s largest outside shareholder, had initially been publicly critical of Musk’s offer and then – the reasons for the shift are unclear – announced that he supported Musk and would happily roll his shares into the new entity. Other reporting helped fill in some of the sources of money.But gaps remained. And once Twitter went private in October 2022 and Musk set about cutting back the divisions of the company that offended him, there was no official list of its shareholders, or the legal names of the trusts, funds, LLCs and other corporate entities holding their shares. Musk called himself a “free-speech absolutist”, but his business dealings tended to be filtered through the usual veil of corporate secrecy, legal threats, nondisclosure agreements, encrypted chats and fleets of powerful attorneys that protect very powerful people. He denounced “lawfare” – the aggressive use of lawsuits to punish one’s enemies –while widely practising it. He banned journalists from X when they displeased him and he ordered the reinstatement of the accounts of Nazis, white supremacists and a QAnon-adjacent influencer named Dom Lucre who’d once posted a screenshot from a video of a child being sexually abused. (He claimed he was drawing attention to the issue of child abuse.)On 20 August 2024, Judge Susan Illston of the Northern District of California ruled in favour of our motion in Anoke v Twitter.Hours after the ruling, the filing containing the list of X’s shareholders appeared on the online court docket, visible to anyone logged into the public court system. I’m still not exactly sure what happened, but apparently it’s a matter of a clerk clicking to change permissions on a limited-access filing, so it’s possible that someone at the court prematurely made the list available. The error, if it was one, was soon noticed by reporters at the Washington Post,who wrote an articleabout the list’s contents.Soon, the list was everywhere, published in hundreds of media outlets, becoming grist for debate, memes, misinformation, and – I hoped – researchers, regulators, and journalists looking into a powerful tech company openly in the tank for the Republican candidate for president.The list, which set out the legal names of about 95 entities owning a piece of X (but not the size of their holdings), began to fill in the picture of whom Musk depended on for cash and the networks he moved in. It was a window into a political and economic formation with increasing purchase on our world.It all started, of course, with Elon Musk. He was the majority owner of X through a trust he controlled. He was followed by Jack Dorsey, the former Twitter CEO and major shareholder who helped deliver the company to Musk. Then there was a host of other tech and finance figures, including many venture capitalists, friends of Musk who were consistent investors in his various enterprises. Some of these firms had close relationships with authoritarian governments, like Saudi Arabia and Qatar, who were direct investors in X. Andreessen Horowitz received hundreds of millions of dollars from Saudi Arabia to invest on their behalf in US tech startups and was in talks with the kingdom about creating a $40bn AI investment fund.Venture capital firms served as Laundromats for a class of kleptocrats, princelings and other global elites, who could funnel their fortunes into one of the US’s most celebrated industries. Silicon Valley venture capitalists and their foreign investors often shared a general disregard for democratic governance. In the Saudi crown prince, they saw a counterpart who demonstrated the same benevolent authoritarian style that they enacted in their business lives – but on an even grander scale, with unchallenged power. Venture capitalists published chatty manifestos about their technological aspirations; Prince Mohammed offered his own consultant-approved economic development plan known as Vision 2030. The two sides had much in common.‘The Godfather, Saudi-style’: inside the palace coup that brought MBS to powerRead more“Saudi has a founder,” Ben Horowitz of Andreessen Horowitz said at a 2023 tech conference featuring Saudi government representatives. (In tech mythology, a “founder” has elite status.)“You don’t call him a founder. You call him his royal highness.”Saudi Arabia’s ailing king and ambitious crown prince were hardly “founders” of a state that, in its current form, had been inaugurated in 1932. But the rhetoric was not just flattery. It resonated in tech circles where an increasing number of people believed that the US would be better off under a dictatorial CEO figure, not an elected president. If Trump were re-elected, Musk had the potential to become that kind of figure.When Musk acquired Twitter, there were rumblings that the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) might investigate the deal. “I call on CFIUS to immediately conduct a review of the recent changes in Twitter’s ownership and governance,” Senator Chris Murphy wrote to Treasury secretary Janet Yellen. “It is essential to our national security that public officials and citizens alike can continue to rely on this platform to be a neutral platform, free of foreign influence.” In his letter, Murphy specifically cited concerns about the Saudi government using its investment “to silence government critics and human rights activists, or to further state-sponsored disinformation campaigns”. According to the Washington Post, the investigation never happened.X did not respond to a request for comment. A Twitter spokesperson said in 2021 that it acted swiftly in 2015 when it learned there were malicious actors accessing Twitter user data. The company also said it was committed to “protecting the public conversation” from abuse by state actors.This is an edited extract from Gilded Rage: Elon Musk and the Radicalization of Silicon Valley published in audiobook and hardback by Bloomsbury Continuum.

Tesla did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.The NHTSA said it has identified 18 complaints and one media report alleging that Tesla vehicles, operating at an intersection with FSD, engaged “failed to remain stopped for the duration of a red traffic signal, failed to stop fully, or failed to accurately detect and display the correct traffic signal state in the vehicle interface”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst ThingFree daily newsletterOur US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Are we riding the wave or will the wave destroy us?Tarik O'ReganThu 9 Oct 2025 02.00 EDTShareThe hacker mansion is part startup commune, part luxury crash-pad, part sales floor for the future. They are dotted around Silicon Valley, inhabited by tech founders and futurists. The most opulent I’ve seen is in Hillsborough, one of the Bay Area’s wealthiest enclaves, just south of San Francisco. Inside, marble floors gleam beneath taped-up portraits of tech royalty; in the gardens, gravel is raked into careful Zen spirals and pools shimmer beyond the hedges.It was a sunny June afternoon, and I had come with my producer, Fay Lomas, to record interviews for aBBC Radio 3 documentaryabout the collision of generative AI and classical music in San Francisco and Silicon Valley.All professional creatives, Fay and I were told cheerfully, would soon exist only as hobbyists. This was not provocation. Not irony. Just fact. It’s the one moment in the documentary when we hear Fay’s voice. She suddenly cuts in, unsettled: “So AI’s going to get rid of my job?” It’s brief. Instinctive. But it changes the air in the room.When we began making the documentary, I was as curious as anyone. “The cat’s out of the bag,” I joked. It felt like the sensible thing to say. The technology was here. Better to work with it than ignore it.View image in fullscreenComposer Tarik O’Regan and BBC producer Fay Lomas in Silicon Valley.Photograph: Joel CabritaWe moved so quickly from talking about how AI could help the creative industries to hearing, quite casually, how easily it could replace every role within themWhen I spoke to Fay recently, she remembered the moment clearly. “We moved so quickly,” she said, “from talking about how AI could help the creative industries to hearing, quite casually, how easily it could replace every role within them. The tone was friendly, encouraging, as if I should be excited.”That exchange feels like the hinge of the story: a small, human moment of bafflement, when the conversation stopped being theoretical and became real.They wanted to make us redundant.That was June. It’s now October, and with a summer dominated byOasis back on tourin the UK and US, I’ve been thinking of another kind of mansion: the band’s concert at Knebworth House in 1996. A quarter of a million people over two nights, waving lighters instead of phones. One of the last great communal singalongs before everything changed. Before Napster and the MP3. Before mobile phones. Before the quiet rearranging of culture by invisible algorithms.View image in fullscreenComposer Ed Newton-Rex plays a keyboard piano while wearing a virtual reality headset at home in Palo Alto, California.Photograph: Marissa Leshnov/The GuardianWhat came next was subtle but seismic: a shift from ownership to access. Playlists replaced albums, not curated by artists but by software, made to melt into whatever else we were doing. Something to work to, shop to, scroll to. We thought we were watching the future of music. Perhaps we were.That is why I paused when, long after finishing the documentary, I read aboutRBO/Shift. It’s an exciting new initiative from the Royal Ballet and Opera exploring how the arts might “interact” with AI. It comes from an institution I care deeply about, run by people I respect and admire: one that has long supported me and many others. It’s presented as a bold, forward-looking conversation between technology and creativity: the beginning of what could be a fascinating partnership. Yet what stands out in the announcement is not what’s there, but what appears to be missing.There’s no mention of ethics, of training data, of consent, of the environmental cost, or of jobs. There’s no sense that this technology now threatens to make the artists and the craft the RBO has helped sustain, and that whole ecosystem of labour, largely redundant.View image in fullscreenA driverless taxi on the streets of  San Francisco.Photograph: Anadolu Agency/Getty ImagesThe tone, much like the one we heard in that Hillsborough mansion, is unfailingly upbeat. “AI is here to stay,” Royal Opera artistic director Oliver Mearssaid last monthin an interview with the New York Times. “We can either put our heads in the sand or ride the wave.”Except that nobody I meet in San Francisco – where this technology is being dreamed up, built and sold – isriding a wave. Riding a wave means surrendering to its pull. The people here have no interest in that. They’re trying to control the tides, to shift the moon if necessary.I don’t want to ignore AI. But that phrase I used earlier, “the cat’s out of the bag”, now feels like its own kind of moral laziness, as if ethics expire the moment something new arrives. After a summer inside the machine, it’s unsettling to watch major institutions treat AI like atomic energy for the arts: dazzling, lucrative, already leaking harm, and still somehow without a warning label.It’s unsettling to watch major institutions treat AI like atomic energy for the artsThings move so fast in this part of the world that our documentary already feels like a historical artefact, a postcard from the last moment before the future stopped asking for permission. That afternoon in the hacker mansion, with raked gravel, sunlight and calm, feels frozen now: the still point before acceleration.When I listen back, I can hear the air shifting. The pause after Fay’s question, my uneasy laughter. It’s the sound of nervousness, of something human still holding its ground.If Oasis at Knebworth was the last great pre-internet singalong, maybe this tiny moment we captured marks the uneasy breath before the machines start to hum their own tune.Tarik O’Regan is a London-born composer, based in San Francisco.

In Malaysia,ILMUchat, built by a local construction conglomerate, boasts that it “knows which Georgetown you’re referring to” – that is, the capital of Penang and not the private university in the US. Meanwhile, Switzerland’s Apertus,unveiled in September, understands when to use the Swiss German “ss” and not the German-language character “ß”.Around the world, language models like these are part of an AI arms race worth hundreds of billions ofdollarsmostly driven by a few powerful companies in the US and China. As giants such as OpenAI, Meta andAlibabaplough vast sums into developing increasingly powerful models, middle powers and developing countries are watching the landscape carefully, and sometimes placing their own, expensive bets.Those bets are all part of a trend loosely called “sovereign AI”, in which governments around the world, fromthe UKto India to Canada, are developing their own AI technologies and attempting to define their place in the emerging ecosystem.But with hundreds of billions of dollars in play globally, can smaller investments secure meaningful gains?“While US-based companies and the US government and China are able to essentially blitzkrieg their way into AI dominance, it’s harder for smaller powers, middle powers,” says Trisha Ray, a resident fellow at the Atlantic Council, a US strategy thinktank.“Unless you’re a rich government or a big company, it’s quite a burden to build an LLM from scratch.”Defence concernsBut many countries are unwilling to rely on foreign AI to supply their needs.The second-largest market for OpenAI users globally, India has registered over a hundred million downloads of ChatGPT in the past few years. But, says Abhishek Upperwal, founder of Indian developerSoket AI, there are numerous examples of US-built AI systems falling short. An AI agent deployed to teach students in a remote village in the state of Telangana speaks English in a strong, nearly-incomprehensible US accent, while an Indian legal startup recently tried to adapt Meta’s LLaMa AI model for its clients, only to find the model delivered a useless hash of hybridised US-Indian legal advice, says Upperwal.Then there’s the national security issue. For India’s defence ministry, the Chinese model DeepSeek, says Upperwal, is off the table: “It could have some random training dataset that might say that, oh, Ladakh is not part of India … Utilising that particular model in a defence setup is a big no-no.“I have spoken to people who are in defence,” says Upperwal. “They want to use AI, but, forget about DeepSeek, they don’t even want to rely on [US] OpenAI-type systems because data might go outside the country, and that is absolutely not OK with them.”Soket AI is one of a handful of companies attempting to build a national LLM for India with the support of India’s government-funded IndiaAI Mission, which has committed roughly$1.25bn to AI development. Upperwal envisions a model significantly smaller than leading models from US and Chinese tech companies, one roughly the size of some releases fromFrench AI company Mistral.AI researchers have long argued that significant resource investment – including in chips and computing power – is necessary to push the frontier of the technology and achieve AGI – artificial general intelligence – the elusive endpoint of the AI arms race. Upperwal says India will have to make up for the funding gap with talent.“Being in India, we don’t have the luxury of pouring billions of dollars into it,” he says. “How do we compete versus say the $100 or $300 or $500bn US dollars that the US is pumping in? I think that is where the core expertise and the brain game comes in.”In Singapore, AI Singapore is the government initiative that backs SEA-LION, the family of language models trained in south-east Asia’s regional languages, which are often poorly represented in US and Chinese LLMs, including Malay, Thai, Lao, Bahasa Indonesia, Khmer and others.I wish the people who are building these [sovereign] AI models were aware of just how far and just how fast the frontier is movingTzu Kit ChanLeslie Teo, senior director ofAI Singapore, says these models are designed to complement larger models, as opposed to replacing them. Systems such as ChatGPT and Gemini, he says, often struggle with regional languages and culture – speaking in stilted, overly-formal Khmer, for example, or recommending pork-based recipes to Malaysian users. Building regional-language LLMs allows local governments to code in cultural nuance – and at least be “smart consumers” of a powerful technology developed elsewhere.“I’m very careful with the word sovereign. I think what we’re trying to say is we want to be better represented and we want to understand the capabilities” of AI systems, he says.Multinational cooperationFor countries trying to find their place in an intensifying global market, there’s another possibility: team up. Researchers affiliated with theBennett School for Public Policyat Cambridge recently proposed a public AI company distributed among a consortium of middle-income countries.They call the initiativeAirbus for AI, in reference to Europe’s successful play to build a rival to Boeing in the 1960s. Their proposal would see the creation of a public AI company that would combine the resources of different countries’ AI initiatives – it names the UK, Spain, Canada, Germany, Japan, Singapore, South Korea, Spain, France, Switzerland and Sweden – to create a competitive rival to the US and Chinese giants.Joshua Tan, the lead author of a paper setting out the initiative, says the idea has attracted the attention of AI ministers of at least three countries so far, along with several sovereign AI companies. While it is now focused on “middle powers”, developing countries – Mongolia and Rwanda among them – have also expressed interest, he says.“Nowadays, I think it’s just a fact there’s less trust in the promises of this current US administration. People are asking like, can I still depend on any of this tech? What if they decide to turn it off?” he says.Tan’s proposal is optimistic about the potential for multinational cooperation. But others say that even a coordinated, multi country strategy risks wasting valuable taxpayer money on an initiative that will ultimately fall short.“I wish the people who are building these [sovereign] AI models were aware of just how far and just how fast the frontier is moving,” says Tzu Kit Chan, an AI strategist who advises the government of Malaysia.“What’s the cost? The cost to governments having a bad strategy of building this roadmap for their own sovereign AI models is that they waste a ton of money.”A better strategy, says Chan, would be for governments like Malaysia to spend the same money on developing stronger regulations around AI safety – as opposed to competing with international products that have already won the market.“Walk the streets of Malaysia, go to Kuala Lumpur, find a finance-bro-looking-person, ask them what model they’re using,” he says.“Eight out of 10, I bet they’re not using the sovereign AI models. They’re saying, ChatGPT or Gemini.”Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)featuresShareReuse this content"

It not only draws hundreds of thousands of players to pack out vast convention halls each year, but it also hosts professionals, offering them a chance to get their games into the hands of fans, and gives industry hopefuls a shot at passing their résumés to developers. For those based outside the US, it is the biggest event of the year by far. It is the International Game Developers Association (IGDA) Foundation’s first year here, and executive director Alyssa Walles is excited.The IGDA Foundation provides professional development for underrepresented and marginalised people hoping to enter the video game industry, a crucial service considering the many barriers prospective producers, developers and writers face. Though Walles is fairly new to the IGDA Foundation, having joined three years ago, she is a video game industry veteran. She knows how crucial it is to help those who aren’t born into privileged situations, who can’t afford to travel across the globe to conventions, or have not had traditional schooling in computer design or coding.View image in fullscreenGamescom hosts video game fans and industry professionals.Photograph: Imago/Alamy“I was part of the launch team of PlayStation in Europe, and I was the only woman in the room most of the time,” Walles says. “So I am so happy to see that change.” But she knows there is more work to be done.The IGDA Foundation started by funding trips for a select group to the annual Game Developers Conference in San Francisco, an expensive endeavour that often excludes hundreds of developers from marginalised communities or more remote regions of the world. When the Covid pandemic redefined video game events, the IGDA Foundation had to get creative – that’s when former executive director Nika Nour came up with the Virtual Exchange, a six-week online programme that pairs grantees with a veteran game industry coach. Out of hundreds of annual applications, the IGDA Foundation selects grantees from three main pillars: games career professionals looking for more senior roles, professionals trying to transition into the games industry and recent graduates.View image in fullscreenAlyssa Walles of the IGDA Foundation.Photograph: Courtesy IGDA FoundationWalles says: “My favourite example of someone in our cohort who has work experience but is trying to break into the games industry is this young man from Nigeria. He’s a home builder, he’s project managing every day, building houses – and he codes. He wants to take that project management experience and become a producer in video games.”For Walles and many other industry veterans who become mentors with the IGDA Foundation, it is about using their experience to ensure the industry has a strong and diverse future. “I’m 65, I’m not afraid about saying that … I’m on the back end of my career, and I’m here to give back,” she says.But the IGDA Foundation, like so many other programmes dedicated to making the video game industry and tech spaces more equitable, has faced frustrating challenges in the last few years. After meteoric growth during the pandemic, the industry has seen record redundancies. Companies are telling Walles they don’t have money for the foundation, which she finds hard to believe (“I know you have $5,000”), and though the IGDA Foundation isn’t government-funded, the Trump administration and Elon Musk’s “department of government efficiency” (Doge) have attacked diversity, equity and inclusivity institutions, which forces them to rethink how they market their programme and how to approach potential donors.“There have been several nonprofits that have had to close in our space. So far, we are not close to that. I worry about it every day,” Walles admits. “I think, how do I get to the people who have made a lot of money in video games and want to support that next generation?”View image in fullscreen2025’s Virtual Exchange in action.Photograph: Courtesy IGDA FoundationBut the IGDA Foundation, with Walles at the helm, is not afraid to get creative. Last year, she saw a story in a newsletter about how a solo developer made significant money from a single piece of downloadable content (DLC) sold in a Steam bundle. “I reached out to the IDGA Foundation’s alumni network and said, ‘I want to do a Steam event with DLC,’ and someone stepped forward to manage it. We created Download for Charity, an event we had in May – we had 24 games participate and raised $24,000,” Walles says. She has also organised game jams with unlikely collaborators and a recent porting initiative to help developers get their games on to Android phones.This dogged pursuit of funding is a testament to Walles’ dedication to the programme and to the marginalised people it serves. Walles’ hope for the future of the IGDA Foundation is simple: “We just want enough money to sustain us so we can provide these programmes for the people who need them around the world.”Explore more on these topicsGamesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

No one can do more to determine the outcome than the US president. This was, for him, a modest statement, acknowledging that Israel and Hamas had agreed to the first phase of his plan – it being their decision, not his, to break a multi-point agreement into a multi-stage discussion. Two parties so far apart agreed on one thing: both would ratherdefer the really difficult issues.In Israel and Gaza,there was joy– however tentative – at the announcement. An end to the annihilation, the release of all hostages and the resumption of large-scale aid have all been desperately needed. There is every reason to fear that thiswill not lead to a lasting peace, and every reason to strive to ensure that it does. In finally reining in Benjamin Netanyahu, and in offering Qatar a security guarantee that persuaded it (with Egypt and Turkey) to lean more heavily upon Hamas, Mr Trump has created an opportunity which must be seized.To recognise that his intercession has brought this ceasefire is also to acknowledge that Mr Trump, and Mr Biden before him, could have ended this conflict long ago. More than three dozen of the hostages taken byHamas-led militantson 7 October 2023are believed to have been killed in captivity. More than 67,000 Palestinians have been killed by the Israeli military in Gaza. The tens of thousands of children who have been orphaned or aresuffering acute malnutritionoffer some indication of how profound and lasting the damage will be.TheHamasatrocities of 7 October, and the genocide in Gaza, have pushed both Israelis and Palestinians towards seeing the underlying conflict as, more than ever, an existential struggle. Hostilities could easily resume – though for now, at least, both Hamas and the Israeli government seem to believe that a deal will be better for them than continuing the conflict.Hamas has no desire to disarm. The bulk of Mr Trump’s plan says that Israel will not occupy or annex Gaza, but offers Palestinians in essence a colonial administration under Mr Trump and Sir Tony Blair, with only the wispiest suggestion that they might prove themselves deserving of statehood in the future. Mr Netanyahu has already rejected that.Israel’s prisoner release will not include the highly popularMarwan Barghouti, jailed for ordering murders in the second intifada and seen by many as the figure most capable of bringing Palestinian factions together. Mr Trump may not remain invested in this crisis for long once he has taken his victory lap. Strikingly, the breakthrough came shortly before theNobel peace prizeis to be announced, on Friday (though the committee held its last meeting on Monday).Emmanuel Macron, whose diplomatic initiatives helped pave the way for this moment, stressed on Thursday that it should lead to a political outcome based on the two-state solution. The growing international pressure upon Israel, itself a reflection of public opinion’s impact upon the governments of its allies, and the increased involvement of the region, were critical. The temptation for Israel’s allies now may be to ease off, acting as if this short-term fix were a solution. They must instead invest intensified effort to produce the strong and durable peace of which Mr Trump spoke – which will only be feasible if it is founded on justice.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

It’s over!” For a moment, I thought I was dreaming. I wondered: what is happening? Has another loved one been targeted? What is over? Then he told me thatDonald Trumphad said it. “I am very proud to announce that Israel and Hamas have both signed off on the first Phase of our Peace Plan,” the president wrote on his social media. For the first day in a long time, people in Gaza woke up to news that could be called happy. The ceasefire went into effect at noon. The sound of Israeli warplanes still echoed in the sky, but, for once, they didn’t feel frightening.The first phase of the agreement only includes the exchange of prisoners. That means 20 Israeli hostages in Gaza thought to be alive and up to1,950 Palestiniansfrom Gaza. Israel has arrested hundreds of us over the past two years without reason. Among them are a relative of mine, detained after Israel’s bombing of theTel al-Sultan displacement campearlier this year, and Dr Hossam Abu Safieh, taken from his workplace while performing humanitarian duties in Kamal Adwan hospital.But fears remain: is the genocide really over?I went out into the streets to see friends and neighbours and exchange political observations. People seem to be trying to make the most of this first phase, as there is no guarantee that it will last. Families await the fresh arrival of gas, flour and sugar, not just to consume but to stockpile, fearing a new siege or sudden price hikes if the truce collapses. My friend Ahmed shook his head: “After the prisoners are handed over,Israelwill find a thousand ways to torture us.” Meanwhile, my friend Khader laughed jokingly: “I don’t care about anything; I just want to eat chicken and get gas into the house.”For most Palestinians inGaza, the ceasefire means no more than these small details: hot meals, cooking gas, and a break from the smoke of firewood that causes headaches and eye irritation. These simple hopes reflect a longing for normal life; for education, food and a peaceful night’s sleep.Others felt nothing. They said it was too early to judge the truce, and that their lives had been destroyed to the point where little could be saved. People are haunted by the faces of loved ones buried under rubble and the thought of spending winter in threadbare tents. Most people here now live in tents and wonder if Israel will repeat what it did during the previous truce by refusing to bring in rubble-removal equipment or temporary housing units. The Israeli army still controls about 55% of Gaza, preventing people in border areas from returning to their homes – or what remains of them.Although people are happy that the bloodshed has stopped, the catastrophe is not over; they remain displaced, refugees in their own homeland. Entire cities like Rafah and Beit Hanoun are still under direct occupation and they may have to wait for the second or third phase of the agreement for the army to withdraw.1:38'Historic moments': Palestinians and Israelis celebrate Gaza ceasefire deal announcement – videoWhile those in Gaza cling to these fragile hopes, politics on the other side of the border threatens to erase them. Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, will continue to face intense pressure from his far-right coalition partners, who view any truce as a betrayal. Figures likeBezalel Smotrich and Itamar Ben-Gvirhave warned in the past they would topple his government if he agrees to what they call “surrender”. Netanyahu’s political survival depends on these extremists and his power depends on the continuation of the conflict, given the legal troubles that could send him to prison once out of office.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Washington and Arab and Islamic capitals are pressing to maintain the truce, and European countries have startedhinting at economic sanctionsin recent months; but inside Israel, the far right demands what it calls “total victory” – a phrase that, for Palestinians in Gaza, means the expulsion and ethnic cleansing of Gaza’s population.This deal may be a gateway to ending the genocide, or a corridor to continuing it in an even harsher form once the world’s attention moves elsewhere. Yet it remains a relief for people in Gaza: roughly 400 trucks entering daily could revitalise the health sector with supplies, and opening the Rafah crossing on the border with Egypt in both directions could allow hospital patients, stranded students and families separated by the conflict to travel.The war has taken so much from us, our homes, lives and loved ones, but it has not taken away our desire to live, to rebuild and to drink a morning cup of coffee without fear. As I write these lines, the sounds of celebrations rise and people are repeating the same words: “It’s over.” I wish I could believe it completely.Hassan Abo Qamar is a Palestinian writer, activist and storyteller based in GazaExplore more on these topicsGazaOpinionDonald TrumpBenjamin NetanyahuIsraelIsrael-Gaza warPalestineMiddle East and north AfricacommentShareReuse this content"

But Mike Johnson is defying the will of the votersThu 9 Oct 2025 10.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 9 Oct 2025 10.31 EDTShareThe people of Arizona’s seventh congressional district – a vast territory extending across the state’s south, along the Mexican border – have been denied representation in Congress for weeks. That’s because Mike Johnson, the Republican House speaker, hasrefused to swear inAdelita Grijalva, their representative-elect, who won a special election to fill the seat vacated by her father, the late Raúl Grijalva, in a landslide late last month. Grijalva, a Democrat, has been largely ignored by the speaker. Unlike sworn representatives, she has togo around the Capitol with an escort. There’s an office with her name on the door, but she hasn’t been allowed inside, and has worked insteadout of a conference roomon another floor.It is an unprecedented abuse of procedural power on the part of the speaker, one that has had the effect of silencing a political opponent and denying representation to the citizens of her district. In refusing to seat Grijalva, Johnson has defied the will of Arizona’s voters, and effectively nullified, at least for the time being, a legitimate congressional election. He has persisted in this even in defiance of his own promises, after saying on Friday he would seat her this week once the House returned to session – andthen telling lawmakersthey wouldn’t reconvene this week after all. Last week, Grijalva showed up to a three-and-a-half-minute pro forma session, hoping to be sworn in then. (Johnson has sworn inother representativesat pro forma sessions in the past.) But the Republican presiding over the session, Morgan Griffith,ignored the effort. On a weekend talkshow, Grijalva said she had heard “absolutely nothing” from the speaker about the timing of her swearing in.Grijalva thinks she knows why. There is no political calculation that could justify Mike Johnson’s refusal to seat a duly elected member of the House: Grijalva won her race, and both his oath to the constitution and his responsibilities to the body that he leads require Johnson to seat her. But in lieu of deference to these higher aims, Grijalva suspects that Johnson is pursuing a much more cynical one: in refusing to swear her in and allow her to take up the office to which she has been elected, Johnson, Grijalva thinks, is aiming to stop her becoming the final member of Congress whose signature is needed toforce a voteon the release of confidential files related to Jeffrey Epstein. Currently, the petition has 217 signatures; it needs only 218. Grijalva has pledged to support it. “Why the rules are different for me – the only thing that I can think of is the Epstein files,” Grijalva told theNew York Times.The Epstein scandal, and the ensuing fallout from new and resurfaced revelations about Donald Trump’s deep and longstanding friendship with the deceased child sex trafficker and financier, has long plagued the Trump administration. One of the few genuine threats to Trump’s grip over his coalition came a few months ago, when hisjustice department refused to releasefiles relating to the case, causing outrage among a group of rightwing podcasters, media personalities and conspiracy theorists who had long traded on speculation about the case and accusations that powerful Democrats were involved in a cover-up.The discharge petition, if passed, would not be likely to result in the actual release of the documents. The move has little support in the Republican-backed Senate; there is no chance that Donald Trump, who has opposed the release of the Epstein files, calling them a“waste” of “time and energy”, would sign a bill into law making them public. But what the move would accomplish is forcing a full chamber vote on the matter, requiring every member of the Republican caucus to go on the record either endorsing the release of the files – and thereby displeasing Trump – or opposing it – thereby displeasing their voters. The Timeshas reportedthat Johnson’s delay is giving the White House more time to pressure Republicans who have already signed on to the discharge petition to remove their signatures before the Grijalva is sworn in.And so it seems that Johnson is ignoring the constitution and subverting the will of the voters in order to buy time, in an effort to spare his party embarrassment over their president’s one-time close confidence with a pedophile.But the refusal to seat Grijalva has broader implications. In using his procedural control over the functioning of Congress to deny a seat to an elected Democrat, Johnson is setting a dangerous precedent and raising questions about future transfers of power. If a Democratic majority is elected in 2026, will the outgoing Republican speaker duly swear in its members? Or will he use his procedural powers to delay one, several or many of them from taking their oaths of office – either under the pretext of election fraud or personal ineligibility, or out of sheer, bald unwillingness to hand over power to members of a party that the president and his allies have repeatedly described as illegitimate?These are no longer fanciful questions; they are ones that must be asked. The Republicans whorefused to subvert the lawfor Trump’s benefit on January 6 are now largely gone; the ones who have replaced them appear much more willing to place party before country. Every day that Grijalva is not sworn in, the shadow they cast over 2026 darkens.Moira Donegan is a Guardian US columnistExplore more on these topicsHouse of RepresentativesOpinionMike JohnsonJeffrey EpsteinArizonaDemocratsUS politicsRepublicanscommentShareReuse this content"

They just don’t trust Democrats to deliver itThu 9 Oct 2025 07.30 EDTLast modified on Thu 9 Oct 2025 13.05 EDTShareIf anyone could have broken through as a progressive in red America, it was Sherrod Brown. For decades, the Ohio senator railed against corporations for shipping good-paying jobs overseas and pleaded withDemocratsto take the struggles of deindustrialized communities seriously. Yet in 2024, even Brown, a model economic populist, fell to a Republican challenger.Does that prove, as writers such as Jonathan Chaithave argued, that the idea of winning back the working class with progressive economic policies has been tried and has failed?We wanted to know why Democrats keep losing working-class support in the Rust belt, and what could turn things around. So, with colleagues at the Center for Working-Class Politics, the Labor Institute and Rutgers University,we surveyed 3,000 votersacross Pennsylvania, Michigan, Ohio and Wisconsin. The research suggests the story is more complicated – and that Democrats’ problems in the Rust belt are real, but solvable.We found a consistent pattern we call the “Democratic penalty”. In a randomized, controlled trial, respondents were shown hypothetical candidates with identical economic populist platforms. The only difference was that some were labeled Democrats, while others were labeled independents. Across the four states, the Democratic candidates fared eight points worse.In Ohio the gap was nearly 16 points; in Michigan, 13; inWisconsin, 11. The voters most alienated by the party label were the very groups Democrats most need to win back: Latinos, working-class Americans, and others in rural and small-town communities.This pattern helps explain why figures like Brown can run as tough economic populists and still struggle, while independents like Dan Osborne in Nebraska dramaticallyoverperformed expectationson nearly identical platforms. It’s the Democratic brand that’s unpopular, not the populism.It’s the Democratic brand that’s unpopular, not the populismWhat’s at the root of the mistrust? After the 2024 election, many commentators pointed to “wokeness” as the culprit. But our research tells a different story. When we asked voters to write a sentence about what first came to mind when they thought of Democrats, 70% offered negative views. Yet only a small minority mentioned “wokeness” or ideological extremism – 3% of Democrats, 11% of independents, 19% of Republicans. The dominant complaints weren’t about social liberalism but about competence, honesty and connection. Democrats were seen as out of touch, corrupt or simply ineffective: “falling behind on what’s important” and having not “represented their constituents in a long time”. While some of these critiques bled into broader claims that Democrats are focused on the wrong priorities, the responses suggest cultural issues are not voters’ dominant concern.This should be a wake-up call. Rust belt voters aren’t gullibly distracted by culture wars but, rather, are frustrated that Democrats haven’t delivered. What does resonate with them is a tougher, more credible economic message.Even if the Democratic label is a serious drag in red and purple states, our results show that full-throated economic populism that speaks directly to workers’ sense that the system is rigged can substantially boost candidates’ appeal, particularly in areas that have lost millions of high-quality jobs over the past 40 years. Standard “bread-and-butter” Democratic messaging performed over 11 points better when paired with strong anti-corporate rhetoric (condemning companies for cutting good jobs) than with a “populist-lite” frame that merely knocks a few price-gougers while acknowledging that most businesses play by the rules.When we forced respondents to choose tradeoffs among 25 economic policy proposals, the results were even clearer. Across partisan and class divides, voters consistently prioritized concrete measures framed in terms of fairness and accountability for elites: capping prescription drug prices, eliminating taxes on social security income, and raising taxes on the super-wealthy and large corporations. These policies polled far ahead of flashy ideas such as $1,000 monthly cash payments or trillion-dollar green industrial plans, and well ahead of traditional conservative staples such as corporate tax cuts and deregulation.Even on immigration, Rust belt voters proved more open than expected. Nearly two-thirds supported legalization for long-settled undocumented workers who had played by the rules. Despite years of rightwing fearmongering, a progressive position carried the day.So what’s the path forward? Not every candidate can reinvent themselves as an independent populist. In many districts, doing so would simply split the anti-Republican vote. But Democrats can blunt the “Democratic penalty” by speaking against their own party establishment and making a populist case that neither major party has delivered for working people. Candidates who take this approach appeal more effectively to the very voters Democrats have been losing.The electoral map itself makes the stakes plain. Without states such as Michigan, Wisconsin,Pennsylvaniaand Ohio, Democrats cannot hold national power. Sherrod Brown’s defeat underlined that even the most credible economic populists can only run so far ahead of the party’s damaged brand.If Democrats remain seen as out of touch with working-class concerns, more Browns will fall, and Republicans will keep gaining ground in once-reliable Democratic strongholds. But if Democrats take on corporate elites, level with voters about their own party’s failures, and fight for policies that put working families first, they might finally chart a path back to the working class – and to the future.Jared Abbott is the director of the Center for Working-Class Politics.

We’re worried about 2050, not 2026.Half of humanity lives in countries that held national elections last year. Expertswarnedthat those contests might be derailed by a flood of undetectable, deceptive AI-generated content. Yet what arrived was a wave of AI slop: ubiquitous, low-quality, and sometimes misleading, but rarely if ever decisive at the polls. Still, given the outcome of the US presidential election, few observers concerned about democracy felt relief. The immediate, prolonged challenges brought by the second Trump administration make it difficult to do much more than react to crises as they happen.But advances in artificial intelligence do pose risks to democracy. Those risks have less to do with highly persuasive deepfakes in a given election cycle – they exist on a longer time horizon, but are no less insidious.Unfortunately, policymakers’ attention has been captured by highly resourced groups with competing but equally undemocratic views of AI governance. Some warn that artificial intelligence is the only way to solve civilizational threats like the climate crisis, justifying any expenditure and advocating for an unregulated tech sector. Others insist that the United States must not stymie AI development so that it does not lose the 21st century to rivals in Beijing. These positions arebeneficialto the bottom lines of those who hold them, but that has not shaken their hold on the debate.Other stances misjudge the timeline on which artificial intelligence might make its mark on democracy. Warnings about immediate and “catastrophic risk”, for example, distract from less speculative harms with fantastic warnings of godlike machines. And while we are sympathetic to the AI reformers who are focused on already existing harms like bias and discrimination, other aspects of AI’s impact on democracy will take decades to play out.In arecent articlein the Journal of Democracy, we argue that there are three long-term trends associated with AI that could result in serious damage to democracy.First, AI could supplant communication between elected officials and constituents. Political strategists have already started experimenting with using AI tools to enhance aspects of polling, constituent services and campaign outreach. Onecongressional candidate in Pennsylvania, for instance, used anAI robocallerin an effort to gather votes for the 2024 election. Campaigns and office holders could take this a step further, using AI to analyze and even predict constituent opinions. Such uses could seriously damage the relationships between politicians and constituents – eroding the foundations of genuinedeliberative democracy. Numbers are poor substitutes for people, a lesson that US presidential campaigns relearn every four years when some computational model of the electorate inevitably fails to predict or deliver victory. Such methods may not capture or reproduce the parts of politics that come out of exchanges between individuals before they have formed firm opinions.Second, those who control AI technology will become more wealthy and powerful and will leverage these resources to dismantle democracy. Technology-related gains in the latter part of the 20th century significantly boosted economic disparity. AI is likely to lead to further inequality in the coming decades. Several of the wealthiest tech billionaires have used the technology’s potential to argue forreplacinghuman workers, and doing away with democratic, participatory forms of governance. Overblown pronouncements about AI’s alleged capability tostreamlineeven the most complex human processes are self-serving for oligarchs looking to dismiss inconvenient calls for justice, dignity and equality.Finally, AI is poised totransformour already disrupted information landscape in ways that contravene democratic communication. News outlets have already been challenged and damaged by social media platforms’ approach to business, engagement and information curation. Large language models (LLMs) will only continue to divert web traffic away from rigorous, ethical and fact-based media entities that actually do the work of investigative journalism. What will replace them? If the answer relies on LLMs, it will cede even greater power to an even smaller number of technology companies. One only has to pause and consider the already worrying susceptibility of the tech sector to political pressure to see how badly this might damage citizens’ access to information.To avoid these outcomes, we must reject the argument that any outcome related to artificial intelligence is inevitable or that AI is too economically and geopolitically important for cautious development. Like the railroad, the lightbulb and other revolutionary technologies before it, the deployment of artificial intelligence willultimately be decided by humansand the impact of its diffusion across the economy will take years to assess. The problem is not a lack of policy solutions; there are abundant proposals to tackle challenges like inequality and the decline of public interest journalism. The problem is a lack of political will, stoked by self-interested parties arguing for inaction.Samuel Woolley is the author ofManufacturing Consensus: Understanding Propaganda in the Era of Automation and Anonymityand co-author ofBots.

But please know that you’re wrong … you’re living in a fantasy land, and after you die nothing happens, stop being a fucking child.” The words of Jim Jefferies there, the riotous Australian-American comedian whose work delights in smashing taboos, offending and outraging, saying the unsayable. Sex, politics, religion, faeces: nothing is beyond the pale. And as such, there was a good deal of expectation over his headline set at the inaugural Riyadh comedy festival in Saudi Arabia, which came to an end on 9 October. What sacred cows would he slay? Who would feel the wrath of his cold, veiny truth?Alas, Jefferies appeared to have been disinvited from theRiyadh comedy festivalafter comments he made on a recent podcast about the murder of Jamal Khashoggi. Even though the gist of said comments was that he wasn’t too fussed about the killing either way. “Unfortunate, but not a fucking hill that I’m going to die on,” were his exact words. To no avail. Cancelled again, this time by one of the richest regimes on Earth. These days, you can’t even describe the extrajudicial murder of a journalist in an embassy as unfortunate. What kind of woke hellscape are we creating for our children?Happily, many more discreet comedians have managed to pass the government vetting process.Jimmy Carr,Louis CK, Jack Whitehall, Omid Djalili, Kevin Hart, Dave Chappelle, Pete Davidson: they tried to make them go to Riyadh, and they all said yes, yes, yes. The lineup, predictably, is overwhelmingly male. Some of the appearance fees have reportedly run to seven figures. And of course what the Saudis are getting for their money is not simply words but silence, not simply performancebut moderation. Welcome to comedy in the age of the autocrats: a procession of paid court jesters who know exactly who is writing their cheques.“The royals loved the show,” the US comic Bill Burr reflected on his experience. And frankly we can only applaud the bravery of a comedian prepared to unleash his edgiest material on an unprimed audience. The “gay gym” routine, for example, in which Burr so eloquently encapsulates the quandary of a straight man working out in a gym full of gay men, afraid to make eye contact in case one of them gets the wrong idea. Making fun of gay people? In Saudi Arabia of all places? What a brave, brave boy.We can assume, similarly, that Chappelle’s cache of material poking fun at trans people went down like a US-made F-15 Eagle over a Houthi-controlled area of Yemen duringthe Saudi-Iran proxy war. And yet, understandably, there were areas where even these brave messengers of truth feared to tread. A leaked contract issued to performers outlined topics that would be deemed unacceptable to the hosts. Jokes about Saudi Arabia itself were strictly off-limits: its royals, its legal system, its government. Any religious material was a no-go. Presumably, too, the country’s human rights record.Which feels slightly incongruous, given the fact that so many of the festival’s performers pride themselves as advocates of free speech. Carr, for example, has called himself “a free speech absolutist”, which is certainly a very noble way of describing what he does for a living. Chappelle has long railed against a cultural consensus that prevents him from telling the jokes he really wants to tell while – confusingly – also allowing him to tell those very same jokes to packed arena audiences every year.But of course it is not hard to divine the true motivations of the new Saudi court jesters. By and large, these performers are established, household-name comedians, already financially secure and simply leveraging their reputation in pursuit of another lucrative payday. A few of them have even been helpfully explicit in this regard. As Davidson explained: “I see the number, and I go: ‘I’ll go’.” The more interesting side of the equation is what the Saudis think they are getting out of it.Because the point that has been overlooked in much of the accompanying commentary is that Saudi Arabia boasts its own rich and active comedy scene, albeit one that rarely lives on the lit stage. Some of the better-known Saudi comics – Amy Roko, Hisham Fageeh, Bader Saleh – are stars of YouTube and TikTok. Naturally they operate within strict constraints, confine themselves to culturally appropriate material. Saudi humour also lives in late-night cafes, in WhatsApp groups and voice notes, on the less regulated corners of the internet and shielded by multiple layers of irony and deniability. Sometimes, this leads to mortal danger: in June a Saudi journalist called Turki al-Jasserwas executedfor allegedly running a satirical X account critical of the regime.The Russian literary theorist Mikhail Bakhtin deployed the term “carnivalisation” to describe the disarming characteristic of laughter: its ability to dissolve conventions, social norms and traditional hierarchies of power. Comedy derives from the revelation of challenging established truth, and in so doing exposing its vulnerability, its dissonance from reality. But what exposure is realistically possible at a festival organised by state decree, where tickets cost up to £200, where performers are given five-star treatment and given a list of proscribed topics?In a way, Riyadh’s investment in comedy can be seen as an ambitious but ultimately doomed attempt by the Saudi government to buy the kind of authentic grassroots culture it is unable to produce for itself. Doomed because ultimately the very materials that produce good comedy – irreverence, human ingenuity, artistic freedom, intellectual courage, a sense of common shared values – are anathema to the dictatorship. This is in essence the equivalent of the Abu Dhabi Louvre, the Qatar World Cup, thegold-plated Oval Office. You can buy comedians, but you can’t buy a sense of humour.Writing in the Guardian, Djalilidefended his participationon the basis that it was “about sharing laughter … a chance for cultural exchange as a force for social transformation”. But how much of this laughter truly escapes the walls of the theatre, beyond the brightly lit plazas of Boulevard City, into the degradation and exploitation beyond? What kind of social transformation is possible when only a privileged few are in on the joke?The American comedian Sinbad once famously observed that “comedians are funnier when they’re riding the bus”. And perhaps bothSaudi Arabiaand its hired entertainers are labouring under a kind of convenient delusion. The naivety of the Saudi government in imagining that comedy can whitewash its many crimes is matched only by the naivety of the comedians, some of whom genuinely believe their presence is a kind of cultural bridge, a force for positive change.Of course artcanchange minds – change worlds – but only if the will to do so truly exists. Or, as a world-renowned standup comedian almost put it: I stand up for your right to do standup comedy in a medieval autocracy. But please know that you’re wrong. You’re living in a fantasy land, and after you leave nothing happens. So, you know.

I say “our” sporting achievements because as a big fan of the Lions and an even bigger fan of the Broncos, their recent premiership successes are partially thanks to me.Sure, I might not play, I might not coach, I might not be involved whatsoever at all in any single way – but I still feel entitled to some credit. Since I was little, I have supported theBrisbane Broncos. For decades I have watched the games, pouring my precious and powerful energy into them. I have cheered their wins, been sad at their losses, and decried and abused countless referees with terrible decision-making skills and presumably personal vendettas against me.Some say Australia’s sporting axis has shifted. Does one city really reign supreme?Read moreThis is what sport support is all about. If you love a club and you’re invested in their success, each season is an emotional rollercoaster – complete with the risk of vomiting. Whether from stress, joy or too many beers, who’s to say? Some people, those non-sport watchers out there, might find these very real emotions hard to understand. Some of them might find it hard to empathise with what you are going through.And sometimes you might be in a relationship with one of them.I have been with my girlfriend for about five and a half years. About five and a half years of that has involved me watching some variety of sport most weekends, and only relatively recently has she finally learned which Brisbane team goes with which sport.She is not an obnoxious “ew, sportsball” person. She is lovely and compassionate. However, during certain times, such as the NRL finals season, she is slightly lacking in what I have termed “sports empathy”. This is different from normal empathy – she is very encouraging of my interests, wants me to be happy and even hopes my team will win. She is simply unable to fully grasp the huge emotions I feel when I watch sport. She does not speak the language.My girlfriend is supportive as a partner, but baffled as a human. She can’t fully understand my sporting woes and joys because she has never felt fully emotionally connected to a sports team. She has never felt the intense rush of a last-minute try or the devastation of a last-second penalty.Last Sunday she had nearly lost all ability to listen to me talk about that evening’s grand final by approximately 10:30am. Her eyes glazed over as she tried, again, to soothe my nerves. By 11am she was simply not responding. (She would like me to add here that I had been speaking at length on the subject for over a week – which I think only further proves her lack of sports empathy.)It’s very difficult to explain your sports feelings to someone if they don’t understand the base level appeal. It’s like explaining salt to someone who has never had food. Recently I tried asking her to imagine her favourite pen brands battling it out in an arena, but for some reason that didn’t do the trick.I was born into the Broncos’ last dynasty but this Sunday could be the sweetest victory of all | Lech BlaineRead moreFollowing sport was basically chosen for me – it was the soundtrack to my childhood. There was always cricket or football on the television and my dad would also listen to sport on the radio (as well as Roy and HG, of course). I have three brothers (two of whom became professional boxers) and we spent a lot of time as kids playing cricket and football, and a game called “brandy” that I’m not sure is legal any more as it basically involves just throwing a tennis ball as hard as you possibly can at another child. Sports emotion is the basis of a lot of connection and communication in our family and community.Luckily, I have people to turn to when my girlfriend has forsaken me and I need comrades in arms: my family and also my NRL group chat with a bunch of straight men. These men are way more dramatic than I am, so I also get to feel superior about my self-control.Both my girlfriend and I are thrilled that Queensland teams keep winning – I because I love them, she because she loves me. Unfortunately for her, and something she definitely won’t know until she reads this article, the Lions are still a chance to make the finals in the AFLW, and my belovedBrisbane Roarare about to begin a new A-Leagues season. My demands for her empathy will continue to grow. She’ll be by my side for the whole thing – she’ll just be reading a book and trying to ignore my impassioned screams.Rebecca Shaw is a writer based in SydneyExplore more on these topicsAustralia sportOpinionBrisbane BroncosBrisbane LionsBrisbane RoarRelationshipscommentShareReuse this content"

I could never do it, but ‘wellbeing days’ do sound niceThu 9 Oct 2025 08.55 EDTLast modified on Thu 9 Oct 2025 15.08 EDTShareIf you want to get rich, a friend of mine said recently, set up an exam centre. We were talking about her decision to home school – or unschool, or home educate, depending on your tribal affiliation – her two children, making her simultaneously part of a broader trend and also somewhat strange to herself. The cliche of home schooling still leans on the idea of a fringe choice made by fanatical parents who produce a poorly socialised child – if you said of a child: “They’re home schooled”, you’d trigger a knowing look that implied: “Say no more.”Well – maybe – all that is changing. Home schooling is still fringe, but the numbers are soaring. In 2024, UK councils received66,000 notificationsof children moving to education at home, more than double the number from 2020 andbringing up the totalto some 111,700 children in England. Given that there are roughly 9 million school-age children in England alone, this still represents a tiny proportion. But the leap – which is subject to large regional swings: the number of home-schooled kids has more than tripled in the north-east and hasrisen by 85%in the east of England – is significant, not least because it seems to encompass families that in a million years would not have imagined themselves taking this path.I spoke to two parents, one in London, one in Yorkshire, both of whom moved their kids to home schooling after or towards the end of primary school, both of whom are loving it, albeit sheepishly, and neither of whom believes it is prohibitively difficult. Both are atypical to some extent, since neither was acting for religious or health reasons, or in response to failures in the threadbarespecial educational needs and disabilities(Send) provision in state schools, traditionally the primary motivators for pulling kids out of mainstream school. To both I wanted to ask: how can you stand it? The staying across the curriculum, the never getting time off and – chiefly – the teaching of maths, which presumably entails you having to do some maths?Tyan Jones, in London, has a son turning 14 who would be inyear 9and a 10-year-old girl who would be finishing up primary school. Instead they are both at home, where Jones oversees their learning. Her eldest son left school after year 6 when he didn’t get into a single one of his requested high schools in a London borough where the choices aren’t great. Her daughter left year 3 a few years later after her son’s departure seemed to work out. She is a single parent who runs her own business and can be flexible around when she works. This is the main thing about home schooling, she says: it permits a form of “concentrated learning” that allows you to determine your own schedule – in the case of her family, doing 9am to 2.30pm “school” days Monday through Wednesday, then taking a four-day weekend during which Jones “works like crazy” at her actual job while the kids do clubs and extracurriculars and all the stuff that keeps them up with their friends.It’s the friends thing that parents of kids in school tend to round on as the starkest perceived downside to home learning. How does a kid learn to negotiate with difficult people, or weather conflict, when they’re in a class size of one? The parents I spoke to said removing their kids from school didn’t entail dropping their friendships, and that with the right out-of-school activities – Jones’s son goes to orchestra on a Saturday and she is, shrewdly, careful to organise meet-ups for him in which he is thrown in with kids he doesn’t particularly like – the same socialisation can occur as within school walls.I mean, to me it sounds like hell. But talking to Jones – who says that if her daughter feels like having a “reading day” or “a complete day of cello”, then she goes ahead and permits it – I can see the appeal. Not everyone does. So strong are the feelings triggered by people making choices for their kids that you might not make for your own that my friend in Yorkshire a) asks to remain anonymous and b) says she has actually lost friends by deciding to home school her kids. “It’s weird how hostile people are,” she says – and this is before you get to the hostility between factions within the home-schooling world, some of which reject the term “home schooling” because it centres the word “school”. (“We’re not into that crowd,” she says drily.)Inside the school refusal crisis: how a mother and her daughters survived a broken systemRead moreThey are atypical in other ways too: her 15-year-old daughter and 19-year-old son are so highly motivated that her son, earlier on in his teens, bought all the textbooks himself, got up before 5am each day to study, knocked 10 GCSEs out of the park a year early and has now returned to sixth form, where he is on course for top grades for all his A-levels (he took some time out before sixth form to be sure that going back to school was what he wanted to do). “He was a boy who loved ballet and the Brontës and hated football – he didn’t fit in at secondary school,” says my friend, who is an artist married to a teacher. Her daughter, meanwhile, was “quiet at school” but has flourished at home, and combines ploughing through the curriculum with a day of dance and youth theatre a week. “I’m upstairs painting,” says my friend while her kids effectively self-educate between textbooks, YouTube videos and the occasional maths tutor.I couldn’t do it. I think I know this about myself. During the pandemic, when I was up against a deadline to finish writing a book, my five-year-olds spent six weeks almost exclusively on TikTok and did none of the school worksheets. If you’re a corporate lawyer or someone who works shifts in retail, it’s not doable without outside help either. But if you can pull it off, says Jones, “it’s less stressful than school. My favourite day is Thursday, a ‘wellbeing day’, when we clean the house, the kids do all the cooking, and we chat and chill.” When my friend in Yorkshire first pulled her kids out of school, she was full of guilt and panic. “Oh my gosh, what am I doing?” But here’s what she discovered: that if your kids “don’t fit the mould”, there is another option, and it’s not as hard as you think.“There’s more time to be alive,” she says of the way they have figured things out – and that includes the one thing parents with kids in school dream of: taking holidays in term time at a fraction of the cost.Emma Brockes is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsHome schoolingOpinionSchoolsChildrenYoung peopleFamilycommentShareReuse this content"

Tragedy after tragedy, it can’t go onJeremy HuntUntil staff are unafraid to be open about genuine mistakes, however devastating, nothing will be learned – and nothing will changeThu 9 Oct 2025 06.01 EDTLast modified on Thu 9 Oct 2025 11.52 EDTShareLucian Leape, a pioneer in patient safety, once said the single greatest impediment to error prevention in the medical industry is that “we punish people for making mistakes.”He was right. In my experience as health secretary, the biggest barrier to safer care in theNHSwasn’t a lack of expertise or dedication. It wasn’t – by the end – a lack of money or even clinicians. It was a blame culture that stopped people being open about mistakes. That prevents professionals from learning from tragedies and condemns the system to repeating them.At the start of Baby Loss Awareness Week, we should remember that the number of tragedies remains heartbreaking. Including stillbirths, there are 4870 baby deathsevery year in the UK– around 13 every day. Some of these would have happened with the best of care, but many more could have been avoided. And every single one leaves behind devastated parents who must do what no human being should ever have to do – bury their own child.Eleven babies died needlessly in theMorecambe Bay scandal. Since I stood up in parliament to respond to the Kirkup investigation in 2015, the NHS has worked hard to learn the hard lessons involved – and progress has been made. Between 2013 and 2023, perinatal mortality in England and Walesfell by around 20%– the equivalent of more than two fewer a day.But since the pandemic, the picture is more mixed. Maternal deaths, although thankfully still rare, have risen and remain much more likely for Black and Asian mothers. Having completed her inquiry into Shrewsbury and Telford, Donna Ockenden is nowlooking into deathsat the Nottingham university hospitals NHS trust. Across England, two-thirds of maternity units are still rated by the CQC as “requires improvement” or “inadequate”. Many families are particularly worried about possible poor care in Leeds, so anew rapid national investigation, under the leadership of Valerie Amos, is looking into maternity safety across the NHS, including a deep dive into services at 10 trusts.If England and Wales matched the baby death rate in Japan, almost two fewer babies would die every day. Closer to home, if wematched Sweden, one fewer would die every day.Both have made great progress in tackling a blame culture that stops vital learning from happening. In Sweden there is no-fault compensation following medical error. Clinicians are wholly accountable, but because the system is not looking for a perpetrator, space is created for honest learning. It is not perfect, but it does avoid adversarial confrontation. Court cases that drag on for five years or more are almost unheard of.View image in fullscreenJoshua Titcombe with his sister Emily.Photograph: PAThe UK is rather different. According to the 2024 NHS staff survey, more than a third of staff don’t feel comfortable speaking up about safety concerns. Even if they want to be open and transparent, the system makes it difficult. Many worry they will be scapegoated by their organisation. Lawyers get involved. Families feel shut out. And the result is that the most important thing of all does not happen: understanding any failures so that system-wide improvements can be put in place to stop the same thing happening again.It doesn’t have to be this way. One of the babies who died at Morecambe Bay was Joshua Titcombe.Years later,his father, James, met one of the midwives involved. She had missed crucial opportunities to escalate concerns and had been suspended from practice. James knew there was no malice – she had been doing what seemed right to her at the time. But he still felt angry: her later statements conflicted with his family’s experience.But in that meeting, something extraordinary happened. The midwife spoke of how she still thought about Joshua, that she wished she had acted differently, and that she was deeply sorry.They ended up crying together. Supported afterwards, she returned to practice. James is certain she will not make the same mistakes again. Honesty and forgiveness don’t just heal – they lead to safer care.If we want to break the cycles of fear and blame that are so common at the moment, we need to reform a system that often means a bereaved family’s only friend is their lawyer. The primary focus of the law is – rightly – justice, but we should not rely on it to improve patient safety. We now spend much more settling litigation claims for baby harm and death every year than theentire cost of NHS maternity services.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

That would be far more consistent with NHS values – and by allowing learning to happen, save countless lives in the process. When Japan did something similar to Sweden for children born with severe cerebral palsy, the number of cases dropped by a quarterin just four years.This is not an argument to exonerate clinicians who deliberately harm patients or fail to learn from mistakes they make. Healthcare professionals don’t go to work to cause harm, but good intentions alone are not enough: competence, behaviour and integrity matter as they do in all professions. But a constructive, just culture should distinguish between professional negligence and the ordinary human mistakes any of us can make. Accountability is not the same as blame. Until we distinguish between the two, tragedies will carry on being repeated.Jeremy Hunt served as secretary of state for health, later secretary of state for health and social care, from 2012 to 2018Explore more on these topicsInfant and child mortalityOpinionNHSChildrenParents and parentingHealthMedicinecommentShareReuse this content"

In one of hisvideos, viewed more than half a million times, the pint-sized pooch stares defiantly at the camera and responds to an empty packet of treats by pressing the “I don’t give a damn” button. Followed by the “bitch” button. Bad dog, Mr Waffles.Then, last month, researchers reported that some dogscan mentally categorise their toys depending on their use.“Fetch toys” can be distinguished from “tug of war toys”, and retrieved appropriately.I’m a dog owner. I fully admit to being one of thethird of Britonswho would rather talk to their pets than to people. At first glance, the study seems to confirm what I already knew – that my dog understands everythingthat I say – but while interactions like this tell us something about how smart dogs are, they barely scrape the surface of their communicative abilities.In recent years, many parallels have been drawn between animal communication and human language. We have learned, for example, that some animals have names that they use for each other. Elephants useparticular vocalisations– harmonically rich, low-frequency sounds – to address key members of their group. “Hey, Dave, over here!”A dialogue with your pets? Do you really want a cat to say you look dog-rough today? | Coco KhanRead moreIn their early months of life, bottlenose dolphins invent their own unique “signature whistle”, which goes on to become the name that others use to call them. During this same time period, mother dolphins communicate with their youngsters using “motherese”. Just like human mums, they adjust the frequency and pitch of the sounds they make to a create a singsong tone thought to facilitate bonding.Meanwhile, songbirds havedifferent regional dialects, meaning the sparrows near me sing with the avian equivalent of a Birmingham accent – “All right, bab!”And sperm whales, which use “names” andaccents, have recently been shown to have their ownphonetic alphabet. The gentle giants communicate with patterns of clicks. By altering their rhythm, tempo, duration and number, simple units of sound can be combined to generate complexity. According to the scientists who discovered the phenomenon, this is similar to the way that humans combine sounds to form words.Whenever these stories break, they are met with surprise. “Aren’t animals clever?! Who’d have thought it?!” But none of this should be surprising. All of these animals live deeply complex, rich and social lives. Sperm whales, for example,live in tight-knit female-led groups, which sometimes come together to form larger groups known as “vocal clans”. They hunt together, babysit for each other and work together to see off predatory orcas. Of course they have complex communication. They need it for survival.The mistake, however, is to presume – a priori – that animal communication is anything like ours. All too often we try to crowbar animal communication into a human-centric framework, but it’s like trying to fit a square peg in a round hole. We’ll never solve the puzzle, because there will always be a fundamental mismatch.Just as a cuttlefish would miss the subtlety of human sarcasm, so too humans are unlikely ever to understand the full spectrum of cuttlefish communication. When they dynamically change the patterning and colour of their skin, it’s fascinating, but alien. Different animals communicate in different ways. Sure they use sound, but they also use colour, smell,electricity,vibrationsand the medium ofexpressive dance. There is an abundance of animal communication that we miss because we don’t have the sensory organs or humility to detect it.Human language – with names and words and syntax and grammar – is just one solution that one species has evolved to help it navigate the challenges that it faces. Non-human animals live different lives with different struggles. If we really want to grasp what animals are “saying”, we need to understand their communication on their terms, not ours.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Through careful observation, she uncovered a wealth of previously unrecognised complexity, including the discovery that chimps communicate using body language as well as sound.Contemporary ethologists have built on this. The work ofCat Hobaiter from the University of St Andrewsshows that chimps have a rich repertoire of gestures that they use for close-up communication. They don’t have “words”,but they do have flexible articulate signals that have meaning. So, when a chimp makes an audibly loud, long, slow scratch, it canmean “groom me”, but it can also mean “let’s travel”. And while they may not have specific gestures or calls for different types of food, such as figs or seeds, maybe they don’t need them. What humans and chimps consider useful information is different.So, instead of marvelling at the ability of pooches to press word buttons, take time instead to marvel at the way dogs communicate with dogs. When my mutt sees his best friend, for a short while his arthritic limbs become jaunty and joyful. There are play bows, tail wags and butt sniffs.

Only a third of those of us alive today were adults when she finally left Downing Street in November 1990. The proportion who remember the 11 years that Thatcher spent in Downing Street is even smaller.For at least the other two-thirds of Britons, Thatcher’s is a name from the past, and little more. The fact she would have been 100 next Monday only emphasises the large gulf that now separates her era from this one. Yet the centenary could be a helpful moment all the same. It could provide a contemporary chance to reflect on what she really means – and does not mean – for modern Britain.This seems hardest in some ways for those of us who can remember her. We tended to take sides. Supporters thought Thatcher could do nothing wrong. Opponents that she could do nothing right. Unsurprisingly, the truth is more nuanced, complex and interesting – as I can vouch from the twice I briefly interviewed her (once, bizarrely, in the Kyiv opera house).As a subject for study, Thatcher has been done few favours either by those who idolise her or those who excoriate her. Listening to both, it is useful to keep in mind that the lady who, in public, was not for turning was also the lady who thought long and hard in private about making spectacular changes of direction. The warrior queen who refused to compromise with the IRA hunger-strikers in the early 1980s, for instance, was also the Thatcher who authorised back-channel talks with the IRA and who permitted her cabinet to debate Irish unification.But the individual battles that Thatcher fought in the 1980s now overwhelmingly belong in the past. The world has moved on. At this distance, what matters is less Thatcher herself, remarkable though she was, and more her effect.Her effect is hard to miss but rarely fully acknowledged. Every one of us lives in a country more deeply marked by Thatcher than by any other politician of the postwar era. Even today, she is part of the reason why we can’t balance the national finances and why politicians are so frightened of tax changes. She is part of the reason we are still so destructively divided about Europe. Yet she is also part of the reason we take the climate crisis seriously, while even at the same time she is part of the reason our rivers and lakes are so polluted.The most important aspect of her legacy was always her determination to speak for business – small as well as large – against the state. She saw entrepreneurship and lower taxes as the foundation of a successful society, and in her years of power, she never deviated from that belief. She wanted to cut government spending and to reduce the role of government in all areas other than national security. It is easy to forget that when she came to power in 1979, her view was almost insurrectionary. When she left in 1990, it had become the collective wisdom. In many ways it still is.Geoffrey Howe’s resignation: the speech that began Thatcher’s downfallGuardianOther parts of her legacy also help vindicate the view of Hugo Young (who wrote about her better than anyone) that her career provides proof positive that individuals matter in history. Thatcher was no libertarian, but she left an individualist legacy. She thought the family knew better than the official in Whitehall – and in town and county hall too – what was good for them. She changed the housing system to boost home ownership in ways that still misshape the housing market and planning decisions today – as well as electoral politics.In the years afterThatcher’s fallin 1990 until her death in 2013, many of her admirers believed that she was, nevertheless, a guiding light for what should happen next. She had not just done big radical things, these acolytes believed. She had also set the agenda for those who came next.Thatcher’s funeralin St Paul’s Cathedral, which I attended, was an attempt to depict her as a second Churchill. She was never that. But it was also an attempt to pretend that the Thatcherite revolution was now the settled reality of modern Britain.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

What was true was that Thatcher and Thatcherism had offered one set of answers at one particular time – at the end of a crisis-ridden period – to endemic problems facing all modern nation states. Among the largest of such problems was reform of public sector efficiency and cost effectiveness, and the search for a more socially virtuous and economically creative balance between the private and public sectors.Yet Thatcher did not solve either of these problems. In some ways, she made them more difficult. New Labour soon had to grapple with them in new ways. When she died in 2013, David Cameron’s coalition government was already struggling with them again. The same problems have proved just as intractable and the answers remained just as elusive. Theresa May, Boris Johnson, Liz Truss, Rishi Sunak and, now, Keir Starmer have all struggled too.So the lesson of Thatcher at 100 is not that everything about her legacy should be rolled back until we rediscover the sunlit uplands of the pre-Thatcher years. That would end in tears. But nor is it that she somehow holds the key to solving Britain’s problems. Her form of leadership is unrepeatable.She can’t solve the Tory party’s problems either. Thatcher’s iconic status meantKemi Badenochhad to offer the obligatory invocation yesterday.

If he doesn’t wise up, that dissonance will sink himThu 9 Oct 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 9 Oct 2025 06.42 EDTShareThe ancient charge levelled against politicians is that they chase public opinion as tirelessly as terriers tailing a caravan. When voters shout, ministers jump to and blurt out a reply, no matter how bad. But there is one problem above any other that Britons say causes them personal distress. It is pushing many to desperate action. It’s the same issue that may well seal the next election. It’s no secret, but instead regularly flashes deepest red in polls. Yet it is neither discussed by our prime minister nor receives urgent ministerial attention. And no newspaper is bawling about it in 72-point type.Here is a case study in just how warped politics and the media are in 2025, and how MPs and journalists work against the interests of their voters and audiences. I refer to the cost of living.Mention it in Westminster, and your audience will think you are regurgitating recent history. The cost of living crisis? Wasn’t that Liz and Rishi’s bag? After Vladimir Putin invaded Ukraine, and skittled energy markets in the process. Huge public anger; a costly giveaway; many glittering careers sacrificed. Prime fodder, surely, for a cracking episode of The Rest is History.But for most other Britons, this isn’t the stuff of memories. They are still in a cost of living crisis. Whether at Ocado or Aldi, food prices keep rising. School uniforms are extortionate. University tuition fees for the new term – jacked up. And last week the cap on energy bills was hiked – just in time for winter.Almost four years after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine sent energy prices rocketing, the average British family is still under huge financial stress. True, the Bank of England is no longer panicking about inflation now that it has gone from double digits to hovering around “only” 4%. But that’s little comfort for most households, who can see there are fewer bags in their weekly shop – and that their pay (up by 20% since 2021) hasn’t kept up with either prices (up 28% since 2020) or fuel bills (which have typically risen by almost£500 in only four years).Whenever the polling company More in Common asks voters to list the main problems facing the UK, thecost of living comes top. What about immigration? It’s rising, and some other pollsters put it just ahead of cost of living. But when voters are asked the biggest issues in their day to day lives, cost of living or financial pressures come way out in front.So here is the UK’s No 1 political problem: rising bills. You may have heard it come up at the school gate or at a local bus stop. You may be among the 58% of British householdspreparing for a colder home this winter. In which case, you will have been almost ignored by leading politicians.“Westminster treats the cost of living as an issue from two years ago; they’ve moved on,” says Chris Annous at More in Common. “But for the rest of Britain it’s still their biggest issue.” At focus groups, he’s noticed that wherever the venue and whatever the subject, those attending can’t stop bringing up the cost of living. From men’s health to green spaces, they all come back to bills.In Liverpool last week,Keir Starmergave his big speech the day before energy regulators raised the cap. The cost of living got mentioned twice in the whole thing. Patriotism? Five times. And flags? Well, there was a whole section on those, along with a dreamy peroration on the England football team in 1996. “An England that belonged to our grandparents and our history,” cried the prime minister. But this imagined England never seems to have room for the people working all the hours and wondering why they have more month than money. Perhaps even raising the omission now counts as un-British.In this great displacement of political attention, at the centre is the media. I asked the Guardian’s research department to count up the number of stories in national newspapers about asylum seekers or small boats or refugees. They found 542 in just the past month. And how many on the cost of living or essentials or living standards? Just 45.About 33,000 people have crossed the Channel so far this year. We can talk another time about therights and wrongs of our asylum system, but just on the numbers that is a number almost insignificant besides themore than 1m households already in the redon their fuel bills and with no repayment plan.Dealing with the high prices of housing, food, utilities and transport would require real politics, rather than the fake politics of waving St George’s flags and locking up pensioners for mentioning Palestine Action. But ifLabourministers carry on pretending that they are helpless to tackle high prices in the face of the markets, they will pay an extortionate political price. A grab bag of means-tested benefits and breakfast clubs at school won’t do it, and extending childcare was actually Jeremy Hunt’s wheeze. It’s already those most financially fearful who are deserting Labour – and the numbers in financial distress are set to grow.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Most governments that serve a full term preside over a rise in living standards of just over 10%. The exception so far appears to be the reign of Boris Johnson/Liz Truss/Rishi Sunak, where living standards look to have stayed the same for the entire five years. That explains a lot of the political volatility, but what lies ahead looks likely to be a lot worse.Taking household incomes after taxes and inflation and housing costs and mapping them against official projections for the economy, they found that unless Labour acted very soon, it was likely to preside over an outright shrinkage in British living standards. This has never happened since records began. It would mean Britons had suffered a decade of no improvement to their living standards. Forget all the missions, forget the promises of change: the typical family would be worse off – and the poorest families would really suffer, losing more than £1,000 a year in disposable income.“If anything is going to finish this Labour government, it will be the cost of living,” says Alfie Stirling, director of insight and policy at JRF. “Too many people seeing too little improvement in their day-to-day lives and livelihood.”And in that vast gulf between what ministers are talking about and what’s gnawing away at voters at night, you have the conditions not just for the wipeout of a Labour government but for destabilising an entire democracy. As a motto for government, “let them eat flags” has the ring of other regimes that ended badly. Because when people see that the system offers them no improvement and their kids no hope, why wouldn’t they choose to smash up the entire thing?Aditya Chakrabortty is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsUK cost of living crisisOpinionHousehold billsKeir StarmerLabourConsumer affairsPovertyInequalitycommentShareReuse this content"

It’s time to use itJohnny RyanThe anti-coercion instrument, or ‘trade bazooka’, is designed to shield against foreign pressure. It should have big tech in its crosshairs to protect European sovereigntyThu 9 Oct 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 9 Oct 2025 11.02 EDTShareWill Brussels ever stand up to Donald Trump and US big tech? Its current lack of action is not just a legal or economic failure: it is a moral one. It throws into question the very foundation of Europe’s democratic identity. What is at stake is not merely the fate of Google or Meta, but the principle thatEuropehas the right to govern its own digital space according to its own laws. If the EU cannot enforce its own laws then it is a vassal to Washington and to Silicon Valley, with Trump as its overlord.First, let us recount how we got here. In late July the European Commission accepted a humiliating deal with Trump that locked in a permanent15% tariff on EU exportsto the US. Europe received nothing in return. The indignity was all the greater because the commission also agreed to give well over $1tn to the US by way of investments and purchases of energy and military materiel. The deal exposed the fragility of Europe’s dependence on the US. Less than a month later, Trump threatenedcrushing new tariffsif Europe enforced its laws against US tech firms on its own soil.For decades Brussels has claimed that its market of 450 million rich people gives it unanswerable sway in trade negotiations. But in the six weeks since Trump’s threat, Europe has done little. Not a single retaliatory measure. No invocation of the new anti-coercion instrument, the so-called “trade bazooka” that Brussels once promised would be its ultimate shield against foreign pressure. Instead, we have polite statements and afine on Googleof less than 1% of its annual revenue for longstanding anticompetitive behaviour,already proven in US courts, that allowed it to “abuse” its dominant position in Europe’s advertising market.The US, under Trump’s leadership, has made its intentions clear: it no longer seeks to strengthen European democracy. It seeks to undermine it.A recent essaypublished on the US Department of State’s Substack, written in the same paranoid, bombastic language as Viktor Orbán’s speeches, accused Europe of “an aggressive campaign against Western civilization itself”. It condemned supposed restrictions on authoritarian parties across the EU, from the AfD in Germany to PiS in Poland.What is to be done? Europe’s anti-coercion instrument works by calculating the degree of the coercion and imposing counter-actions. Provided most European governments agree, the European Commission could kick US goods and services out of Europe’s market, or apply tariffs to them. It can strip their intellectual property rights, block their investments and require reparations as a condition of readmittance to Europe’s market.The instrument is not merely economic retaliation; it is a declaration of political will. It was designed to signal that Europe would never tolerate foreign coercion. But now, when it is needed most, it lies unused. It is not a bazooka. It is a paperweight. In the months leading to the EU-US trade deal, many European governments talked tough in public, but failed to push for the instrument to be activated. Others, including Ireland and Italy, publicly pushed fora softer European line.A softer line is the last thing that Europe needs. It must enforce its laws, even when they are inconvenient. Along with the anti-coercion instrument, Europe should shut down social media “for you”-style algorithms, that recommend content the user has not asked for, on European soil until they are proven safe for democracy. Citizens – not the algorithms of foreign oligarchs beholden to foreign interests – should have the freedom to decide for themselves what they see and share online.Trump is putting Europe under pressure to water down its digital rulebook. But now more than ever, Europe should hold large US tech firms accountable for anti-competitive market rigging,snooping on Europeans, andpreying on our children. Brussels must hold Ireland accountable forfailing to enforceEurope’s digital rules on US firms. Enforcement is not enough, however. Europe must progressively replace all non-EU “big tech” platforms and cloud services over the next decade with homegrown alternatives.The real danger of this moment is that if Europe does not act now, it will never act again. The longer it waits, the deeper the erosion of its confidence in itself. The more it will believe resistance is futile. The more it will accept that its laws are not binding, its institutions not sovereign, its democracy not self-determined. When that happens, the path to authoritarianism becomes inevitable, through algorithmic manipulation on social media and the normalisation of lies. If Europe continues to cower, it will be drawn into that same abyss. Europe must act now, not only to push back against Trump, but to create space for itself to exist as a free and sovereign entity.And in doing so, it must plant a flag that the rest of the world can see. In Canada, South Korea and Japan, democracies are watching. They are wondering if the EU, the last bastion of liberal multilateralism, will resist foreign pressure or surrender to it. They are asking whether democratic institutions can survive when the most powerful democracy in the world turns its back on them. They also see the example of Lula in Brazil, whofaced down Trumpand demonstrated that the way to deal with a bully is to hit hard.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

There is also this … erm … entirely bizarre mystery thriller from Netflix, adapted from a novel by Ruth Ware, about an intrepid Guardian reporter called Laura Blacklock, played by Keira Knightley. Fresh off a lid-lifting scoop about Kurdish children, she is invited aboard a colossal private yacht with a party of notables and celebrities, as the guest of sinister plutocrat Richard Bullmer, played by Guy Pearce; he wishes to transport them all to a gala dinner in the Norwegian fjords for an announcement about the charitable foundation endowed by his wife Anne (Lisa Loven Kongsli).Once aboard and out on the open seas, Laura witnesses something deeply strange regarding the woman in cabin 10 – the cabin next to hers – but can’t get any of the guests or crew to believe her. Did she imagine it? Is the strain of her award-winning investigatory journalism causing her to have a breakdown? Among the hilariously Agatha-Christie-ish lineup on the passenger manifest is Laura’s ex-boyfriend Ben (David Ajala), Mr Bullmer’s personal physician Dr Mehta (Art Malik), bullish businessman Thomas Heatherley (David Morrissey) and his boozy wife Heidi (Hannah Waddingham), Instagram star Grace (Kaya Scodelario), smug socialite Adam (Daniel Ings) and druggie pop star Danny (Paul Kaye).It sounds fun on the face of it, and the sheer silliness of the situation almost keeps it afloat, but the cardboard quality of the drama gets soggy. Knightley repeatedly finds herself in a situation where she falls from a great height into water; it happens twice and each time she shows her remarkable resourcefulness and an ability to hold her breath. Audiences might need that last skill as well.The Woman in Cabin 10 is on Netflix from 10 October.Explore more on these topicsFilmThrillersKeira KnightleyFilm adaptationsThe GuardianGuy PearceDavid MorrisseyreviewsShareReuse this content"

The British prime minister has flown to Mumbai with the largest trade delegation ever and unlike previous slightly dodgy ones from the 1700s that went for spices and tea, he’s gone to Yash Raj Films – one of Bollywood’s biggest studios, with the hope of creating a new genre: BollyBrit.Singing, dancing, the stiff upper lip. Never before in cinema history have these combined. And for good reason.That’s why, when Starmer initially announced that three newBollywoodproductions would be shot in the UK, film-makers here in Mumbai shrugged, assuming it was just about location. Just another trio among the hundreds made every year in India.Given the general hassles of shooting in any Indian location (people staring, infrastructure nightmares, bribes et al), locations in the UK have doubled up forIndiamany a time, as some sort of brilliant reverse colonial joke.Blenheim Palace, Winston Churchill’s birthplace, became a girls’ college in north India (inKabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham). The same film featured Waddesdon Manor in Aylesbury as a rich Delhi man’s private home and Paddington has many a time become an Indian train station. The great irony that the Mumbai train station, originally English-built as Victoria terminus, was replaced by a London train station to look more like modern India, is enough to drive any postcolonial observer mad.Sadly, unlike Indian food, Bollywood stories, beyond the extravagant Punjabi wedding dancing sequences, haven’t permeated into mainstream UK stories, except among British Asians. So it is very possible that as I write this, a primary school in Margate is doubling up as aMumbaitax office in a noir-musical-comedy-action-thriller-mystery-horror-romcom, unknown to British cinephiles.However, this isn’t about location any more.Starmer is in Mumbai along with representatives of key British entertainment companies, including BFI, Pinewood Studios, and the British Film Commission, to discuss collaborations that could possibly go beyond locations and create a genre mashup. It shouldn’t be long before two very different cinematic styles come together – one reserved, witty, quiet, real, researched, and the other melodramatic, talky, implausible, geographically vague.It is what the world is waiting for. The days of waffling about with Slumdog Millionaire, Merchant Ivory, Best Exotic Marigold Hotel, where the cultures brush gently and respectfully, in a recognised genre, are over. BollyBrit’s purpose is not to satisfy but confound. Too many viewers ask: “How did they make this?” It is time to ask: “What is it?”What screenplays of mass entertainment Bollywood films do very well, is have you suspend disbelief to a point where you don’t believe this is a movie. That’s a sort of artistic nirvana one needs to aspire to. For example, a film that starts out as a spy thriller, might become a mythology lesson, digress into a superhero CGI spectacle, and end with a patriotic song, all the while advertised as a whodunnit.British films, in contrast, are about one thing. For example, Bill Nighy in a typical prestige drama set in war-ravaged post Edwardian London, mumbling Pinter-esque subtext to his unrequited love to Helen Mirren, is a kind of film where you know they’ve suppressed feelings for 50 years, and it’ll end in a Brief Encounter sort of way, with a sad unspoken parting. Why not suddenly have a whole chorus show up in the climax, of gen Z Indian Instagram influencers, plus Ed Sheeran, singing “She loves you, you idiot”. The principals could sing, “We didn’t know” and many costume changes, a romance and musical could ensue. Clarity helps. I can’t wait.Anuvab Palis a British-Indian comedian and screenwriter.

It’s a movie that could have been made at any time in the past 50 years, with high-concept provocations and talking points that feel like something from the age of Kubrick’s Clockwork Orange or Ôshima’s Max Mon Amour, or even, indeed, Skolimowski’s The Shout.In present day England, Tommy (played by Anson Boon) is a teenage kid completely obnoxious and out of control: clubbing and bingeing booze and coke, evidently paid for with the monetisation income from hugely successful social media streams which show him racing stolen cars with his similarly odious mates. But Tommy’s online profile has caught the disapproving eye of Chris (Graham), a middle-aged road-safety campaigner and family values enthusiast, who wears a wig and has high-up contacts in the police and Home Office.When Tommy is staggering stupefied around the streets after another massive night, Chris kidnaps him and chains him up in the basement of his handsome country house, perhaps paid for with his wife’s money; this is Kathryn, a deeply depressed silent wraith of a woman played by Riseborough. With the help of a baton and Taser for punishment, and various treats and privileges for good behaviour – such as a longer chain so Tommy can reach the actual lavatory, rather than using the bucket – Chris is on a mission to train Tommy to be a good son to them, and an exemplary older brother to their 10-year-old boy Jonathan (Kit Rakusen), who at all times maintains a fixed smile and saucer-eyed expression of suppressed fear. In fact, the film’s most realistic moment of sociopathic cruelty is Jonathan maintaining that obedient smile, even as his eyes are brimming with tears, while Chris irritably tries to teach him algebra. But Tommy might yet befriend the couple’s exploited Macedonian cleaner (Monika Frajczyk).In the film’s Kubrickian moments, Chris makes Tommy watch his shameful TikTok videos, but in a spirit of sentimental leniency allows him to sit down (with the manacle around his neck of course) to watch Ken Loach’s Kes, clearly believing he will be duly instructed by this story of how a kestrel being trained exalts and civilises both animal and delinquent boy. And Tommy duly starts to acclimatise to the new normal and Kathryn comes out of her shell. The movie’s ironies and cruelties clatter across the screen, but Komasa also allows the audience to consider who it is Chris really wants to train. There is something very theatrical about Good Boy – I can imagine this on the London West End stage. Perhaps it would be much less with a lesser cast: Graham and Riseborough execute the bland nastiness expertly.Good Boy screened at theLondon film festival.Explore more on these topicsFilmLondon film festival 2025Drama filmsLondon film festivalAndrea RiseboroughStephen GrahamFestivalsreviewsShareReuse this content"

I was definitely influenced by Airplane! but I think our humour was different. We didn’t change the wheel, but we put a rim on the tyre.

It not only draws hundreds of thousands of players to pack out vast convention halls each year, but it also hosts professionals, offering them a chance to get their games into the hands of fans, and gives industry hopefuls a shot at passing their résumés to developers. For those based outside the US, it is the biggest event of the year by far. It is the International Game Developers Association (IGDA) Foundation’s first year here, and executive director Alyssa Walles is excited.The IGDA Foundation provides professional development for underrepresented and marginalised people hoping to enter the video game industry, a crucial service considering the many barriers prospective producers, developers and writers face. Though Walles is fairly new to the IGDA Foundation, having joined three years ago, she is a video game industry veteran. She knows how crucial it is to help those who aren’t born into privileged situations, who can’t afford to travel across the globe to conventions, or have not had traditional schooling in computer design or coding.View image in fullscreenGamescom hosts video game fans and industry professionals.Photograph: Imago/Alamy“I was part of the launch team of PlayStation in Europe, and I was the only woman in the room most of the time,” Walles says. “So I am so happy to see that change.” But she knows there is more work to be done.The IGDA Foundation started by funding trips for a select group to the annual Game Developers Conference in San Francisco, an expensive endeavour that often excludes hundreds of developers from marginalised communities or more remote regions of the world. When the Covid pandemic redefined video game events, the IGDA Foundation had to get creative – that’s when former executive director Nika Nour came up with the Virtual Exchange, a six-week online programme that pairs grantees with a veteran game industry coach. Out of hundreds of annual applications, the IGDA Foundation selects grantees from three main pillars: games career professionals looking for more senior roles, professionals trying to transition into the games industry and recent graduates.View image in fullscreenAlyssa Walles of the IGDA Foundation.Photograph: Courtesy IGDA FoundationWalles says: “My favourite example of someone in our cohort who has work experience but is trying to break into the games industry is this young man from Nigeria. He’s a home builder, he’s project managing every day, building houses – and he codes. He wants to take that project management experience and become a producer in video games.”For Walles and many other industry veterans who become mentors with the IGDA Foundation, it is about using their experience to ensure the industry has a strong and diverse future. “I’m 65, I’m not afraid about saying that … I’m on the back end of my career, and I’m here to give back,” she says.But the IGDA Foundation, like so many other programmes dedicated to making the video game industry and tech spaces more equitable, has faced frustrating challenges in the last few years. After meteoric growth during the pandemic, the industry has seen record redundancies. Companies are telling Walles they don’t have money for the foundation, which she finds hard to believe (“I know you have $5,000”), and though the IGDA Foundation isn’t government-funded, the Trump administration and Elon Musk’s “department of government efficiency” (Doge) have attacked diversity, equity and inclusivity institutions, which forces them to rethink how they market their programme and how to approach potential donors.“There have been several nonprofits that have had to close in our space. So far, we are not close to that. I worry about it every day,” Walles admits. “I think, how do I get to the people who have made a lot of money in video games and want to support that next generation?”View image in fullscreen2025’s Virtual Exchange in action.Photograph: Courtesy IGDA FoundationBut the IGDA Foundation, with Walles at the helm, is not afraid to get creative. Last year, she saw a story in a newsletter about how a solo developer made significant money from a single piece of downloadable content (DLC) sold in a Steam bundle. “I reached out to the IDGA Foundation’s alumni network and said, ‘I want to do a Steam event with DLC,’ and someone stepped forward to manage it. We created Download for Charity, an event we had in May – we had 24 games participate and raised $24,000,” Walles says. She has also organised game jams with unlikely collaborators and a recent porting initiative to help developers get their games on to Android phones.This dogged pursuit of funding is a testament to Walles’ dedication to the programme and to the marginalised people it serves. Walles’ hope for the future of the IGDA Foundation is simple: “We just want enough money to sustain us so we can provide these programmes for the people who need them around the world.”Explore more on these topicsGamesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Burey’s debut book – a combination of memoir, research, cultural commentary and interviews – seeks to unmask how companies co-opt identity, shifting the burden of institutional change on to individual workers who are already vulnerable.The impetus for the book lies partially in Burey’s own career trajectory: various roles across corporate retail, startups and in international development, filtered through her experience as a Black disabled woman. The dual posture that Burey experiences – a push and pull between asserting oneself and seeking protection – is the engine of Authentic.Itlands at a moment of collective fatigue with institutional platitudes across the US and beyond, as backlash to diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programs mount, and many organizations are scaling back the very structures that once promised change and reform. Burey enters that terrain to argue that retreating from authenticity rhetoric – that is, the corporate language that trivializes identity as a collection of aesthetics, quirks and hobbies, keeping workers preoccupied with managing how they are perceived rather than how they are treated – is not a solution; we must instead reframe it on our own terms.Through vivid anecdotes and interviews, Burey shows how marginalized workers –people of color, LGBTQ+ people, women, people with disabilities – learn early on to calibrate which self will “pass”. A vulnerability becomes a liability and people overcompensate by working to appear palatable. The act of “bringing your full self” becomes a projection screen on which all manner of expectations are cast: emotional labor, disclosure and constant performance of gratitude. In Burey’s words, we are asked to expose ourselves – but without the protections or the trust to survive what emerges.View image in fullscreen‘In Burey’s words, we are asked to expose ourselves – but without the protections or the trust to survive what emerges.’Photograph: Macmillan PublishingShe illustrates this dynamic through the story of Jason, a deaf employee who took it upon himself to educate his colleagues about deaf culture and communication norms. His willingness to share his experience – an act of openness the workplace often praises as “authenticity” – briefly made daily interactions easier. But as Burey shows, that progress was precarious. When staff turnover erased the informal knowledge Jason had built, the culture of access dissolved with it. “All of that knowledge left with them,” he notes wearily. What remained was the exhaustion of having to start over, of being made responsible for an institution’s learning curve. In Burey’s view, this is what it means to be asked to expose oneself without protection: to risk vulnerability in a system that applauds your transparency but refuses to codify it into policy. Authenticity becomes a trap when institutions depend on individual self-disclosure rather than structural accountability.Burey’s writing is at once lucid and lyrical. She marries intellectual rigor with a tone of kinship: an invitation for readers to lean in, to question, to dissent. For Burey, dissent at work is not loud rebellion but principled refusal – the act of resisting conformity in environments that demand gratitude for mere inclusion. To dissent, in her framing, is to question the stories institutions tell about fairness and belonging, and to decline participation in rituals that sustain inequity. It might look like naming bias in a meeting, opting out of unpaid “diversity” labor, or setting boundaries around how much of oneself is made available to the organization. Dissent, she suggests, is an assertion of self-respect in spaces that often reward compliance. It is a practice of integrity rather than defiance, a way of insisting that one’s humanity is not conditional on institutional approval.She also refuses brittle binaries. Authentic does not simply toss out “authenticity” wholesale: instead, she calls for its reclamation. For Burey, authenticity is not the unfiltered performance of personality that corporate culture often celebrates, but a more deliberate alignment between one’s values and one’s actions – an integrity that resists distortion by institutional demands. Rather than treating authenticity as a mandate to overshare or conform to sanitized ideals of openness, Burey urges readers to preserve the parts of it rooted in truth-telling, self-awareness and ethical clarity. In her view, the goal is not to abandon authenticity but to relocate it – to move it out of the boardroom’s performative rituals and into relationships and workplaces where trust, equity and accountability make genuine self-expression possible. Authenticity understood as a private, personal virtue is insufficient, she argues. Instead, authenticity must be collective, relational and structural. She advances the notion that we might reclaim agency – not by “performing identity better”, but by refusing complicity in the structures that exploit it.Authentic argues that marginalized employees are routinely required to demonstrate exceptional competence while contending with tokenization. They are expected to shoulder a disproportionate “cultural tax”, stepping in to provide mutual support where institutions fall short, and to lead diversity initiatives without genuine decision-making authority or sufficient resources. When these initiatives are dismantled or defunded, silence is often imposed on these employees. In practice, their contributions are dismissed, access to senior leadership remains obstructed, and their basic accommodation needs or visible markers of difference become recurring points of contestation.Burey grounds her claims in a diverse palette of voices, referencing thinkers such as bell hooks, Audre Lorde and Toni Morrison, and weaving cultural critique and scholarly insight.For example, Burey invokes Morrison to expose how institutions sustain inequity through endless dialogue rather than change. Quoting Morrison’s observation that racism functions as a “useful distraction” – forcing the marginalized to continually justify their existence – Burey situates the corporate workplace within that same dynamic.Equally diverse are the sources she consults, which she states in her author’s note are people of color who she intentionally chose not to identify by race, although it is “a common journalistic practice to name the race for people of color, teaching readers to understand ‘white’ as the default.” The decision to omit racial descriptors to interviewee names, as well as focusing on the experiences of those who are often punished for showing up authentic, is Burey’s small attempt to reclaim these voices from the margins.One of Burey’s victories is the clarity with which she reveals the inner workings of corporate illusion. She identifies the “authenticity playbook” that organizations deploy: expressive gestures (celebrating Juneteenth and honoring Martin Luther King Jr) layered over structural inaction (weak pay equity, racist performance reviews, stunted pathways for marginalized staff).The stakes she conveys are not abstract. Marginalized workers are increasingly paying with their health and their dignity in the workplace. Burey writes that disability both reveals and destabilizes the fiction of fixed identity – anyone can become disabled, suddenly or slowly, and yet workplaces remain built on the presumption of permanence and sameness. Even showing up – requesting accommodations, asserting boundaries or moving through space differently – becomes a form of resistance. Burey underscores that ableism, like all systems of exclusion, extracts not only from those it marginalizes but also from the collective humanity of the workplace itself. To reclaim authenticity is not merely to “feel safe”, but to demand environments in which difference is structurally legible – and unequal burdens are dissolved, not outsourced.Jodi-Ann Burey’s Authentic is not a comfort book. It is, rather, a reckoning: a mirror held to institutions that profit from the rhetoric of identity, and a hand extended to those who want to do work differently. It is at once personal and systemic, critical and hopeful. Though it may frustrate those seeking polished corporate manuals, it rewards readers willing to engage with discomfort, to interrogate the terms of belonging, and to imagine that a different culture of labor is possible.If you care about how identity, power and work intersect, if you wonder whether the workplace you inhabit wants your full self or just the parts it deems safe, this book demands your attention. The myth of authentic self at work may be deep, but Burey shows us how to begin excavating a more just ground beneath it.Explore more on these topicsBooksRaceLGBTQ+ rightsGenderfeaturesShareReuse this content"

First, Chevalier’s Books in Los Angeles called off her event after what Matari described as pressure from local community members. The employee who had booked the event refused to cancel it, and the bookstore fired her. Two days later, another employee quit in solidarity.Then came New Jersey. Watchung Booksellers, a community bookstore in Montclair, was set to host her next reading but abruptly canceled, explaining in an emailed statement it was “to ensure the safety of our staff and customers”.Matari had recently published Everything Grows in Jiddo’s Garden, a picture book about a young Palestinian girl learning about her heritage through her grandfather’s gardening, rooted in his ownfather’s traditions fromPalestine. But local campaigns targeted bookstores that planned to host readings by Matari, focusing on her social media posts about Israel and Gaza.View image in fullscreenEverything Grows in Jiddo’s Garden.Illustration: Courtesy of Jenan MatariThree thousand miles away and a couple of months earlier, Safa Suleiman was flying to Seattle for her very first school visit for her publishing debut, Hilwa’s Gifts. Her phone rang mid-flight: the Arabic and Hindi language school had canceled her visit because of a2024 blogposton her website where she had shared details about her family members being killed in Israeli airstrikes in Gaza.“I never saw myself in children’s books growing up, and I was about to share my book with children who may never have seen themselves in children’s books either,” Suleiman said.These experiences are part of a wave of censorship that has swept across the United States since 7 October 2023, interviews with nine children’s authors reveal. Event cancellations, book bans and coordinated harassment campaigns have proliferated through schools, libraries, and bookstores, targeting authors who have either written about Palestinian life and culture, have supported Palestinian rights, or been caught in the backlash simply for their visibly Muslim identity.For some of the Palestinian American authors among them, the pattern makes them feel that their very existence is threatening, and sharing idyllic stories that define their childhood – however innocent – can trigger organized campaigns accusing them of seeding antisemitism and hatred.View image in fullscreenSafa Suleiman.Photograph: Courtesy of  Safa SuleimanAccording to2024 researchby the author and educator Nora Lester Murad, there have been 114 English-language children’s books explicitly centering Palestinian narratives for K-12 readers. There has been an uptick in recent years – 44% of Palestinian children’s books since 1998 were published between 2019 and 2023. Yet much of this increase comes from self-publishing, with 32% of recent titles self-published as traditional publishers remain reluctant gatekeepers.“It’s this effort to reject the people,” Matari said. “Now that we’ve broken through this industry and there’s more books coming out, it’s like … we can’t stop people from reading your story. So we can stop people from getting to know you, or connecting the authors with the stories that they write.”“Freedom of speech isn’t afforded to everybody in this country, especially if you’re Palestinian,” she added.The first full week of October is Banned Books Week in the US and is a time meant to highlight censored voices. Yet pro-Palestinian authors are finding themselves at the center of a new form of literary censorship, though the books being challenged don’t advocate political positions or promote hatred. They tell simple stories of gardens and olive trees, of children navigating identity and language, of family traditions preserved across generations.The books themselves aren’t always the focus of the protests – in some cases it’s the opinions of the authors, expressed on social media or elsewhere. “Nobody had a problem with the book. Palestinian voices are important. The problem was this particular author and the views she holds,” one rabbi involved in the protest against Matari’s event in New Jerseytold a local paper.But that kind of scrutiny strikes some authors are unfair. “You have to prove that you’re innocent of being an antisemite if you have any kind of pro-Palestinian commentary. Even just saying, ‘Here’s a link to donate to Palestinian kids’ – that becomes political,” said Jamila Thompkins-Bigelow, who had a school event originally scheduled for October 2023 get postponed and ultimately canceled months later.View image in fullscreenA page from Suleiman’s  Hilwa’s Gifts.Photograph: Text copyright © 2025 by Safa Suleiman. Illustrations copyright © 2025 by Anait Semirdzhyan.On 7 October, the California governor, Gavin Newsom,signed a pair of bills into lawdesigned to combat hate and antisemitism in schools. One new law establishes an office of civil rights and an antisemitism prevention coordinator, and requires districts to investigate and take corrective action when “discriminatory content is used in classrooms or professional development”.The concern swirling in the world of children’s authors is that the vague language could be used to label their books and their stories as discriminatory, giving state officials legal cover to further suppress Palestinian narratives from schools, and perhaps see these restrictions expand in other states and professional settings.Earlier this month, Hannah Moushabeck received a call about an upcoming speaking engagement at North Carolina State University in Raleigh, where she had been invited to discuss her book Homeland: My Father Dreams of Palestine and the censorship attempts against it. University administrators told her that her book violated North Carolina’scompelled speech and neutrality lawbecause it “doesn’t show two sides to the story”. Moushabeck could attend the event, administrators told her, but she was prohibited from reading from her book.View image in fullscreenHannah Moushabeck discussing her book.Photograph: Courtesy of Hannah MoushabeckBut it’s hardly the first experience with censorship this author had to endure. Moushabeck said she had had five visits cancelled since 2023 and the threats became physical at her nephew’s elementary school in Amherst, Massachusetts, last year. “I had to arrive at the school at six o’clock in the morning and go in through the back with a security escort,” Moushabeck said. A Jewish friend accompanied her for additional protection while school security and police remained on standby. “I remember having to do my school visit and keep a smile on my face and keep incredibly calm, because I really didn’t want my nephew to see that we were at risk.”At Germantown Friends, a Quaker school in Philadelphia, Thompkins-Bigelow was scheduled for an all-day visit in October 2023 to launch her book Sister Friend – a story about friendship between a Black girl and a Muslim classmate who wears a hijab. A couple of days before the event, administrators announced a postponement.View image in fullscreenInside Jamilah Thompkins-Bigelow’s book Sister Friend.Photograph: Supplied“They felt that in the time that we were in, it was a protective measure,” Thompkins-Bigelow recalled. What followed was months of rescheduling without firm dates, culminating in contract termination inFebruary 2024 after around 150 Jewish parentsdemanded the school remain “a safe space for Jewish students”.“I felt like the microscope was on me as soon as they recognized that, oh, this is a Muslim author and she said something about Palestine,” Thompkins-Bigelow, who wears a hijab, said.View image in fullscreenAutumn Allen.Photograph: Jannah GravesAutumn Allen faced similar targeting last year when two of her planned school visits were canceled, one in the Sharon city school district in Pennsylvania just days before the event.Allen, who writes young adult novels and picture books, was scheduled to discuss her work when parents began flooding the administration with complaints after seeing promotional materials. But the content of her writing wasn’t the issue. Instead, complaints sent to school administrators cited her social media posts about Palestinian rights.The Sharon district and another school in Brookline where she was an alumna buckled under pressure from what Allen described as “a handful of very loud” voices creating “this urgency and this feeling of horror” about her visit.“It’s never about the content of the talk. It’s always about who I am as a person,” Allen said. “And at the end of the day the parents were saying they were going to show up at protests and [the administrator] said they didn’t want to make a scene in front of the kids.”View image in fullscreenAya Khalil.Photograph: Dr Kasumi YamazakiThe Egyptian American author Aya Khalil said her book The Arabic Quiltwas removedfrom Pennsylvania’s Central York district not because anyone objected to its story but because “diverse” books were the target. “They didn’t even read the book. They’re just like, OK, we’re gonna remove these books from the shelf.”Afterwards, she started to notice how her own bookings dropped dramatically after being outspoken about the censorship surrounding Palestine and Palestinian authors, illustrators, creatives and educators.“A lot of them haven’t been getting invited to schools or they have been getting their author visits canceled,” Khalil said. “I used to get maybe 10 to 15 libraries per year.” Now she rarely fields requests.Ironically, the attempted suppression has sometimes backfired. Matari’s book sold out its first printing of 5,000 copies before it reached store shelves, and Khalil estimates 10,000 copies of her books were purchased in the York school district, largely due to community support mobilized in response to the cancellations and bans.View image in fullscreenThe Great Banned-Books Bake Sale.Photograph: Courtesy of Aya KhalilFor Khalil, the experience led her to write a new book, The Great Banned-Books Bake Sale, about a girl who organizes a bake sale to buy back banned books, eventually leading to a reversal of the ban.At least one author has been able to rebuff attempts to cancel her events. Maysa Odeh, whose debut book A Map for Falasteen, about a little girl named Falasteen learning about her roots, faced removal attempts in Watertown, Massachusetts, in an organized campaign by a group calledEnd Jew Hatred. Watertown officials were flooded with thousands of complaint emails following the call to action to cut it from the second-grade summer reading list, but the library stood their ground.View image in fullscreenMaysa Odeh.Photograph: Courtesy of Maysa Odeh“I can’t really get into the mind of the person who read my book and felt threatened by it,” Odeh said.At the National Council of Teachers of English (NCTE) conference last November, Odeh and other authors required security after being targeted by the pro-Israel media organization Committee for Accuracy in Middle East Reporting and Analysis (Camera), which has been long accused ofsmear and intimidation tactics. The group, which also runsan education institute, attends teaching conferences, and has continued todocument and monitorpro-Palestine voices.“I kind of went into it blind and when I realized they were there, I reached out to my publisher, and NCTE offered a security guard,” Odeh said about Camera’s presence at NCTE. “They’re like, we can’t get rid of them … a security guard was there at my panel on building empathy through picture books”.“Once I was on these conservative social media channels, the onslaught was unrelenting,” Moushabeck said. Camera had written “five separate articles” about her, “and when you Google me, some of the first articles that come up” are from them. “I noticed that when people were criticizing my book, they were pulling direct quotes from those articles.”View image in fullscreenMaysa Odeh’s A Map for Falasteen.Photograph: Maysa OdehAnd for new authors such as Jenan Matari, the cancellations are about more than book talks and school visits – they are about who gets to tell their own stories. The pressure campaigns, the threats, the social media monitoring and the overarching bans have only reinforced what she already knew: that some voices are still seen as too dangerous to be heard.“They couldn’t stop people from reading about Palestine,” she said. “So now they’re trying to stop people from meeting the authors who write about it.”This story was amended on 9 October 2025. An earlier version reported an event was cancelled because of Jenan Matari’s book when it was because of controversy about her social media posts.Explore more on these topicsBooksPalestineMiddle East and north AfricafeaturesShareReuse this content"

We’re pleased with the court’s dismissal and look forward to continuing our work successfully promoting Drake’s music and investing in his career.”A spokesperson forDrakesaid in a statement: “We intend to appeal today’s ruling, and we look forward to the court of appeals reviewing it.”Drake, who is signed to Republic Records, and Lamar, signed to Interscope Records, both operate under the Universal Music Group umbrella but through separate labels. The legal fight began earlier this year when Drake accused UMG of damaging his reputation by distributing and promoting Not Like Us.He claimed the company made secret payments and offered discounted licensing deals to boost the song’s reach, allegedly to harm his brand and reduce his leverage in ongoing contract talks.In March,UMG filedto have the motion dismissed. The label claimed that Drake “lost a rap battle that he provoked and in which he willingly participated”.“Instead of accepting the loss like the unbothered rap artist he often claims to be, he has sued his own record label in a misguided attempt to salve his wounds,” UMG said in its statement. “Plaintiff’s complaint is utterly without merit and should be dismissed with prejudice.”Kendrick Lamar is widely acknowledged to have won last year’s culture-consuming rap beef with Drake, with Not Like Us going on to win five Grammy awards, including record of the year and song of the year.Explore more on these topicsDrakeUniversal MusicKendrick LamarRapHip-hopnewsShareReuse this content"

The actor, best known for the 00s TV series The OC, will take on the role played by Barbara Stanwyck in the 1944 film noir adaptation.Barton described Double Indemnity as a “gripping tale of deceit, tension and suspense”. Her character, Phyllis, concocts a scheme with a salesman to murder her husband and make it look like an accident, in order to cash in on the eponymous clause in his life insurance policy.The adaptation is by Australian playwright Tom Holloway. It will be directed by Oscar Toeman for a UK and Ireland tour that opens at Devonshire Park theatre in Eastbourne on 5 February and visits Nottingham, Brighton, Cardiff and Dublin among other cities.

She appeared in an Irish stage production of Steel Magnolias at the Gaiety in Dublin and on tour in 2012. “I’m very proud of the Irish side of the family,”she told the Guardian earlier this year. “My mom was so proud to see me at the Gaiety, she literally cried … We went to Cork, Galway and Limerick.

Aniston, who has been the target of media and online gossip for decades, was withering in her criticism, saying: “I’m sure the guys who came up with [social media] thought it was a great idea and, yeah, congratulations on your billions, but it has taken down a huge portion of humanity.”She also suggested that the treatment she received from tabloid and magazine gossip writers in the 1990s and 2000s, focusing on her relationship with her former husband, Brad Pitt, and her fertility issues, has simply moved online. “So now any schmuck can stay anonymous and write whatever the hell they want to write.”Aniston also said she has regularly been the victim of deepfake images, a phenomenon that is reflected in a plotline in The Morning Show. “I catch things all the time,” she said. “Or friends send me things saying, ‘I don’t think this is you’, or ‘I don’t think you’re advertising this’, and I’ll send it to my lawyers so they can do a cease-and-desist. It’s just such a runaway train.”She also outlined why she decided to publicly discuss her difficulties with conceiving childrenwith an article in the Huffington Post in 2016. “[The media] didn’t know my story, or what I’d been going through over the past 20 years to try to pursue a family, because I don’t go out there and tell them my medical woes. That’s not anybody’s business. But there comes a point when you can’t not hear it – the narrative about how I won’t have a baby, won’t have a family, because I’m selfish, a workaholic. It does affect me – I’m just a human being. We’re all human beings. That’s why I thought, ‘What the hell?’”She added: “The older I get, the less I care about correcting a narrative, because it will happen eventually. The news cycle is so fast, it just goes away. Of course, there are times when I feel that sense of justice – when something has been said that isn’t true and I need to right the wrong.

Its finale is superb – and leaves you begging for moreEllen E JonesThu 9 Oct 2025 10.25 EDTLast modified on Thu 9 Oct 2025 10.27 EDTShareBack in 2018, when the first, web series of Adjani Salmon’s sitcom was released, its very existence was a boon to a British film/TV industry notably lacking diversity at all levels, and still in thrall to all-white period dramas. Here was a show about working-class Black Britons that both eschewed the usual drug-dealing stereotypesandwas created by a real-life Black person. Salmon co-wrote and starred as Kwabena Robinson, an aspiring film-maker struggling to get a career foothold, while also making his rent and cultivating a romance with doe-eyed love interest, Vanessa (Babirye Bukilwa).The fact that Dreaming Whilst Black was actually good, while not strictly necessary, definitely helped. The first full series won critical plaudits for its confident combination of creative industries satire, sensitive dramedy and surrealist touches. Now, the show is back for a second series, in which some of those easy, TV critic assumptions – about what progress looks like; about the intrinsic value of “diversity” and “representation” – are themselves questioned. It’s not a rude awaking from Kwabena’s dream exactly, but the arpeggio alarm on his iPhone 11 is definitely starting to sound.Kwabena’s long-distance relationship with Vanessa has fizzled and while he now has an agent (Jessica Hynes), he’s still struggling to find gainful, meaningful employment in his chosen field. This stance – overly fussy or honourably principled; take your pick – might go some way to explaining why, as Uncle Claude (Roger Griffiths) puts it: “Kwabena is the only Black man in England that never got any work out of Black Lives Matter.” (The elders are as merciless with their careers advice and their cussing out as ever.)So things have moved on, yet Dreaming Whilst Black remains rich with funny, true observations, about the hypocrisies and degradations of working in TV, and Black British life in general. Pertinent questions raised this series include: “Who the fuck wines to Giggs?” and “What has Jamaican national dish ackee and saltfish – served on rye, no less – got to do with celebrating Barbados?” Throughout, the showconsistently hits a tone that’s thoughtful-yet-funny and freewheeling-yet-focused.View image in fullscreen‘Rich with funny, true observations’ … Dreaming Whilst Black.Photograph: BBC/Big Deal Films/Gary MoyesOne bum note, at least on first viewing, is the white characters. While last series’ magnificent micro-aggressors included bravura turns from Peter Serafinowicz and Isy Suttie, they’ve now mostly been replaced by broader caricatures. There’s Amy’s new culturally appropriating colleague and the Essex-accented influencer who is the female lead in Sin and Subterfuge, the Bridgerton-esque period drama Kwabena is eventually hired to direct. She’s egregiously under-qualified, especially opposite a legendary Black actor like Rudolph Williams (Kobna Holdbrook-Smith). Yet the whims of “colourblind casting” demand it.Some of these performances take on different shades of nuance as the series progresses. (Is it OK that we’re laughing at the first assistant director, mainly because of his comedy Greek accent? Hold that thought …) But even if they hadn’t, the sheer novelty value of finding fault in the underwriting ofwhitesupporting characters would not be lost on this TV critic. Still, it’s no coincidence that one standout episode, Black Love, features none of these characters, instead paralleling the date nights of three Black couples at three different life stages.It’s always from Kwabena’s interactions with other Black characters that the most clarifying insights emerge. When, early on in the series, he screws over another aspiring director, rest assured the moment will return to haunt him. (There’s also an extra meta-textual bite in the fact that this character is played by Kayode Ewumi, veteran of more than one unjustly overlooked Black sitcom – whatever happened toEnterprice?That show was funny!) And when Rudolph classily confronts Kwabena about his people-pleasing directorial style, it reveals how the price of entry into a privileged elite – be it “whiteness” or a well-paid job in British media – is often our complicity in the exclusion of others.Meanwhile, it’s in the fantasy sequences that Dreaming Whilst Black seems to be having the most fun. If only Sin and Subterfuge had culture-melding costumes and dialogue like the period drama of Kwabena’s imaginings. (Sample line: “One doth think he is … a pussyclart!”) These are our regular reminders that Adjani is a much better writer than Kwabena, and thathisshow is directed with far more care and attention to detail.If you hadn’t clocked that already, witness how the finale masterfully ties up some storylines – in ways both neatly ironic and bitterly plausible – while leaving others open to tantalise us and, presumably, the commissioners. Please, good BBC sirs, deliver unto us series three with haste! And don’t spare the horses!Dreaming Whilst Black aired on BBC Three and is on iPlayer nowExplore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewTV comedyreviewsShareReuse this content"

Instead, we get three hours of platitudes. What a maddening waste of her personalityLucy ManganThu 9 Oct 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 9 Oct 2025 06.00 EDTShareAn intimate portrait of Victoria Beckham is what we were promised by the lavish publicity surrounding the release of the three-part documentary – entitled Victoria Beckham – about the female half of the enduring power couple, and an intimate portrait of the singer turned mogul is what was not delivered. It is about as intimate as a Pret sandwich, and if anyone thought for a moment it was going to be otherwise, well, let me introduce you toWith Love, Meghan, whose searing insights into life as a duchess in Montecito are going to blow your mind.Victoria Beckham the documentary is as immaculately groomed, polished and controlled asVictoria Beckhamthe person. It is a puff piece for her, for husband David, her beauty line and, above all, her fashion business. It charts her evolution from stagestruck child and teenager (“You got a callback for Starlight Express!” mum Jackie recalls proudly), to Spice Girl, to most famous of the England football team’s WAGs, to increasingly successful fashion designer and businesswoman. Against a background of preparations for her biggest show yet, in the grounds of a Parisian castle, a variety of big names in the industry – including Anna Wintour, Tom Ford and Donatella Versace – talk about what is needed on top of talent to make it in a competitive (not to say vicious) field, the snobbery she faced as a newcomer from the world of entertainment and the scepticism she has overcome.David testifies to her work ethic (“She likes to prove people wrong. Quietly”) with his customary charming twinkle and humour, and Victoria covers her “miserable cow” image (the product of the intense media focus on her looks and flaws, which later contributed to her eating disorder, explained here by Beckham as an attempt to control one of the few things she could at the time). When they are together they tease and mock each other with the ease of the long-married, but it is the unspoken, underlying joint reluctance to go out to a party that is probably the most resonant scene for those of a similar age and marital state. It is good to know that however glamorous the event, by 50 you secretly just want to stay home.View image in fullscreenThe waste becomes infuriating … Victoria Beckham.Photograph: Netflix/PAHer mentor, Roland Mouret, is there to recount how he helped her become a designer (“You need ego, then you need modesty”) and how her first show – a tiny collection, 10 dresses shown in a New York apartment – was a wild success. Once people were convinced it was in fact Beckham’s own work and not Mouret’s, the fashionistas gradually let her into the fold. Bar a tricky moment involving millions of pounds of debt (effectively to her husband, who had invested heavily from the beginning) created by – hmm – being absolutely stupid with money is probably the best way I can summarise it, she has gained respect with every new collection, including the Paris show we see being put together over the nearly three-hour runtime.Buried in this meticulously curated, extremely boring account of V Beckham’s rise and rise is a more interesting one about how we find our calling in life, how we come to know ourselves, what it means to have a creative urge and the joy that comes when you find the way to express yours. Beckham’s face lights up when she recalls learning her trade from Mouret, and when she is pinning outfits in the studio or putting together looks for the models. With her colleagues she moves differently, confidently; she relaxes in some ineffable but profound way, knowing she is in the right place, doing the right thing. The childhood urge to perform has found its true expression in designing beautiful clothes.It could also be remade as a meditation on why the media take against some people, and some women in particular. Watching Victoria Beckham, you begin to see that it was always her inconsistency that put them off – the sober industriousness inherited from her parents lying beneath the apparently frivolous exterior. She was supposed to be a show pony – instead, she is an artist. She was supposed to be style over substance, but she has managed both. It does not compute. Just smile for the photographs. And she does not. She’s not that way inclined.But these are thoughts and musings the programme has no interest in pursuing. It is a three-hour advert for brand Beckham with no higher purpose than to fulfil the £16-maybe-£20m deal they signed with Netflix, and a companion piece to the oneDavid did in 2023. And it works. But she is so drily funny, so clearly far more interesting and insightful than she allows herself to be here, that the waste becomes infuriating. I would love to see her talk properly rather than in platitudes. Put her and best mate Eva Longoria in a room with a camera and a few bottles of wine and watch them go.

Likewise,Seamus Heaneyintroduced Northern Irish vernacular into the English lyric, peppering his lines with words likeglarry, the Ulster word for muddy;kesh, from Irishceis, a wickerwork causeway; anddailigone, “daylight gone” or dusk, from Ulster-Scots. It is this that gives his writing a mulchy richness and cultural resonance that remain unique in contemporary poetry. One of the key poems in North (1975) is a version of Baudelaire’s The Digging Skeleton, to which Heaney brings an Irish flavour – the skeletons dig the earth “like navvies”. It’s especially rich as digging for Heaney is also a metaphor for writing, while the archaeological metaphor resonates with the darkly symbolic bog poems.Bringing all Heaney’s poems together in one volume, this collection lets us see for the first time all the archaeological layers that make up his oeuvre, from the talismanic Death of a Naturalist (1966) to the visionary long poem Station Island (1984), on to the parables of The Haw Lantern (1987) and the intimacies of The Human Chain (2010), the last volume published during the poet’s lifetime. A key poem in that collection, Chanson d’Aventure, describes his journey to hospital in an ambulance following a stroke: “Strapped on, wheeled out, forklifted, locked / In position for the drive”. The book also makes available at last Heaney’s prose poems, Stations (1975), released in a small press edition by Ulsterman Publications, which Heaney effectively kept under wraps as he felt the publication of Geoffrey Hill’s Mercian Hymns – “a work of complete authority” – had stolen his thunder in this form.The editors have taken the admirable decision to leave the published volumes intact, so that their careful ordering, something Heaney learned from Yeats, remains in place. Between each volume they insert all the contemporaneous poems that Heaney published in magazines and in pamphlets, as well as a selection of previously unpublished manuscript poems. There are a surprising number of these uncollected poems, and what surprises too is the richness of these previously undisclosed seams. In the earliest poems we see the influence of Ted Hughes and Gerard Manley Hopkins as Heaney gropes his way towards his distinctive personal style. There are important occasional poems such as An Open Letter, protesting about his inclusion in the 1982 Penguin Book of Contemporary BritishPoetry, and a smattering of villanelles that simmer deliciously without reaching the intensity of the collected verses. Elsewhere we see Heaney trying out different metaphors for the act of writing, such as casting a line, before he settles on the metaphor of digging in Death of a Naturalist. And there is the occasional radiant gem, such as Aran: “The rock breaks out like bone from a skinned elbow / And the island coughs itself into high cliffs / That drop straight down to goose-flesh waves on the winter sea.”What impresses is the consistency and the variety, coupled with the continuing ability to surprise us, for while Heaney always hugs the shore of tradition, he is not afraid to experiment, developing and deepening his craft. In an interview with Dennis O’Driscoll, discussing the attention he pays to the sounds of words in Wintering Out (1972), Heaney was dismissive when asked about the sound poets Kurt Schwitters and Bob Cobbing, pronouncing: “I have nothing at all to declare in that area.” Yet when I corresponded with Heaney in 2006 about experiments in French poetry, including the formal innovations of the Oulipo, he responded with enthusiasm. The French tradition of syllabic poetry, where syllable takes precedence over stress patterns, informs the slithering six-syllable lines of Beyond Sargasso, one of many poems about eels, in Door into the Dark (1969). Heaney’s love of a pun is pushed to the limit with chilling effect in Two Lorries, his only sestina, which reinvents the form by metamorphosing the end word “load” into “lode”, “lead”, “payload”, and finally “explode”. In Seeing Things (1991) Heaney creates a form of his own invention in the clarifying 12-liners of the sequence Squarings, a form he was to return to again and again, where he attains a new simplicity and transparency, almost stripped of rhetoric, as the skin is stripped from an eel: “Roof it again. Batten down. Dig in. / Drink out of tin. Know the scullery cold, / A latch, a door-bar, forged tongs and a grate.”Some of Heaney’s boldest work is to be found in his translations, and while these, including his prizewinningBeowulf, have mainly been published in a separate volume, we find the freer translations collected here, many of which come close to Alice Oswald’s idea of “trans-shifting”, as in his reworking of Dante in Station Island. Two poems in Human Chain riff on Virgil’s Aeneid VI, where Virgil visits the underworld. The Riverbank Field moves Virgil across time and place, replacing the Lethe with local river the Moyola:Ask me to translate what Loeb gives as“In a retired vale…a sequestered grove”And I’ll confound the Lethe in MoyolaBy coming through Back Park down from Grove HillAcross Long Rigs on to the riverbank –Which way, by happy chance, will take me pastThe domos placidas, “those peaceful homes”Of Upper Broagh. Moths then on evening waterIt would have to be, not bees in sunlight …In Route 110, we see Heaney bag a secondhand Virgil in Belfast’s Smithfield Market, before taking the bus, Cookstown via Toome and Magherafelt, and as we follow him, as in Joyce’s Ulysses, Virgil’s underworld and the shades of the Troubles are superimposed: “And what in the end was there left to bury / Of Mr Lavery, blown up in his own pub / As he bore the primed device and bears it still // Mid-morning towards the sun-admitting door / Of Ashley House?”This book is a landmark, and while some readers, including this one, may at first balk at 500 pages of notes, these have been compiled with loving expertise, leaving no stone unturned. Above all, the notes let us glimpse Heaney’s processes – “all those anglings, aimings, feints and squints”, as he puts it in Seeing Things, with reference to the game of marbles – how he tries out ideas in draft, sometimes abandoning them, and then returns to the same material later, before arriving at the final poem. The resulting volume lets us see Heaney’s work, whose ripples we are still learning to navigate, for the colossal achievement it is, and it reminds us that Heaney is not only a keeper but an enricher of the word-hoard.Philip Terry’s latest collection is Dante’s Purgatorio (Carcanet).

Maybe the movie documentary form is something that naturally comes alive when showcasing particularly vivid still images. Here is another outstanding example, from writer-director Yemi Bamiro, about the remarkable career of Kwame Brathwaite, a photographer, musician and African American activist who was a unique politico-aesthete. With his brother Elombe, he virtually invented the phrase “Black Is Beautiful” in the 1960s by photographing the Grandassa Models in Harlem: young African American women who became the sensational template for beauty, doing away with the usual cosmetic products and the usual white standard of femininity.Black Is Beautiful became a radical rallying cry, an inspired three-word prose poem and manifesto for change. Simply to assert that black people were beautiful was a liberating force in art, politics and culture, and Brathwaite became a part of Black power’s pan-Africanist movement by photographing Muhammad Ali before his Rumble in the Jungle fight in Zaire in 1974. He was the exclusive photographer for the Jackson 5’s African tour, and became the house photographer for the Apollo theatre, building an amazing archive of black musicians, and with Elombe was the driving force behind bringing Nelson Mandela to speak in Harlem.His son Kwame Jr is interviewed and he recounts the family’s mission to get his father’s legacy and achievement properly recognised after he was hurtfully overlooked in Washington DC’s National Museum of African American History and Culture, opened by Barack Obama in 2016. And the film also recounts the inexpressibly painful origin of Brathwaite’s interest in photography: the horrendous images ofEmmett Till, the young African American lynching victim whose grieving mother defiantly asked for an open coffin so the brutal truth of racist violence could not be covered up.In this image of horror, Brathwaite found a kind of anti-epiphany which led him to images of beauty and of aspiration and community. And his images were eloquent of celebratory strength and often not overtly political: he curated a new iconography of empowerment around which political movements could gather.

Faces of victims, witnesses and possible perpetrators loom up to the cameras, sometimes in the harsh glare of headlights or flashlights as the officers approach, their faces and voices eloquent of wariness or panic or indignation or suspiciously contrived innocence. And we often incidentally glimpse the faces of the officers themselves, one standing by blankly while the other asks the questions with what sometimes seems like extraordinary diffidence – though perhaps this is because they know they are being recorded.We have already had the Netflix true-crime documentary American Murder: Gabby Petito, aboutthe slaying of an Instagram influencer by her boyfriend, whose main point of interest was body cam footage and in which, as in this film, the police seemed extraordinarily lax with the perpetrator. There is alsoBill Morrison’s Oscar-nominated short Incident, composed entirely of body cam film. Now comes Geeta Gandbhir’s documentary aboutthe grim case of Ajike Owens in Ocala, Florida, a woman of colour whose four young kids allegedly harassed and tormented her white neighbour, Susan Lorincz. In 2023, after an escalating series of neighbour-dispute incidents in which the police were repeatedly called, Lorincz shot Owens dead through her closed front door, when Owens went to Lorincz’s house to confront her about throwing objects at her children.The arresting officers found evidence that Lorincz had done online research into Florida’s “stand your ground” laws, which allow householders and others to shoot if there is a significant presumption of danger. The movie builds its story with the body cam footage generated during the repeated police visits to the scene before the killing, and then at the horrific and chaotic crime scene itself – prefaced by 911 audio material of Lorincz calling the police in a melodramatically shaky voice. There is also police cell footage of Lorincz which has a chilly, queasy fascination.The film does not really suggest anything too complicated about Lorincz, or any extenuating circumstance. She is clearly unstable, although the children are heard calling her “the Karen”, an ugly jibe. The film is presented as an example of how “stand your ground” laws generate senseless and tragic bloodshed. But the fact of gun ownership and the second amendment (that historic American constitutional privilege that thelate Charlie Kirk notoriously said made gun deaths a price worth paying) is not much highlighted.It is possible to watch the police interrogation scenes here and feel astonished at how little interest the officers took in this point. When did she buy her gun? Where (if anywhere) did she train in its use? Had she ever had occasion to fire it before? Where did she store it in the house? Was it just on the couch, loaded and ready? The police aren’t shown asking any of these surely relevant questions (though they may have done in footage that didn’t make the edit). Or is gun ownership so normal it would be like asking about microwaves or toasters?‘The world needs to know what happened to my baby’: inside devastating new police-body-cam film The Perfect NeighborRead moreFor what seemed to her neighbours a very long time, Lorincz was not even arrested and charged, only detained and even offered a hotel stay away from home for the night (another point of comparison, incidentally, with the Gabby Petito case). And when she was finally formally arrested in the holding cell, there is an extraordinary sequence in which Lorincz simply refuses to stand, refuses to put her wrists out for the cuffs, not aggressively, but with the politely self-pitying air of someone whose mental health means that she just can’t do it. Had the kid-gloves treatment up until that point encouraged her to think that this might actually work?It didn’t; and the jury’s verdict is saved for the closing credits. A very sombre picture of American crime and punishment.The Perfect Neighbor is in cinemas from 10 October, and on Netflix from 17 October.Explore more on these topicsFilmDocumentary filmsUS crimeGun crimeFloridaUS policingreviewsShareReuse this content"

But not when that condition zaps and jabs and stabs at the genre itself, piercing the carapace of sentimentality while surreally commenting on the form and on the demure niceties of polite society, in which we all keep our thoughts to ourselves.Kirk Jones’s terrifically warm, generous film is about real-life activist John Davidson, who is from Galashiels in the Scottish Borders and has Tourette syndrome, with its tics, compulsive behaviour patterns and random obscene shouts. He was awarded an MBE in 2019 for his work educating the nation about the condition since he first exhibited its symptoms as a teenager in 1989, as captured in the BBC’s sensational documentaryJohn’s Not Mad. I Swear containsa great performance from Robert Aramayo, full of intelligence and charm, and it raises relevant questions about the overdiagnosis debate surrounding conditions such as ADHD and autism, as well as the larger tonal point of how, when and whether to laugh at John or with him.Scott Ellis Watson plays the young John at school, who is bullied and savagely given the strap as he becomes symptomatic in his teens. Aramayo is then the adult John, sweet-natured and stoic, who gets punched in clubs and is brutally hospitalised for yelping at a girl in the street. There are also lovely performances fromShirley Hendersonas his mum Heather, who can’t cope, Maxine Peake as the mental health nurse who takes him in, and Peter Mullan as community centre worker Tommy, who gives John a chance. John is at one stage tempted into carrying drugs under his jumper for some local villains, but his condition means he is hilariously bad at this; he shouts, “I’m carrying drugs!” in front of two policemen in the street.John insists that Tourette is “not a disability”: it is an interesting talking point, given that so many people with other conditions appear to claim precisely this status. But then what is it? When John appears in court, Tommy persuasively testifies on his behalf to the effect that, however it’s defined, John can’t be making it up, when it gets him assaulted, vilified, rendered all but unemployable and shoved into a police cell – and the judge appears to concede this common-sense point.Actor Robert Aramayo: ‘Like anybody who hasn’t had the education, I thought Tourette’s was all about swearing’Read moreJohn eventually meets other people with Tourette, leading to an amazing scene in the back of a car with a young woman in which they yelp at each other surreally before calming down; the film shows the experience to have been cathartic and therapeutic. In later scenes John convenes sessions for many people with the condition and their families and carers, but there is no question of ironising these scenes or even burdening them with meaning or social commentary – this is notMarat/Sadewe’re talking about. The film tactfully passes over the question of what the condition has meant for John’s romantic life.Do John’s tics represent access to some sort of inner truth? Do we laugh because he can say what we can’t? Sort of. Just before meeting the queen to get his MBE, he shouts: “Fuck the queen!” (We see real video footage of him getting the medal over the closing credits, although not this amazing event.) It’s not the truth, though; he is actually very proud of meeting the queen and getting his honour. Yet we can all feel oppressed and nervous and resentful in the moment; the impulse to shout back at unhappiness. This is an absorbing, compassionate film.I Swear is in UK cinemas from 10 October, and in Australian cinemas from 8 November.Explore more on these topicsFilmPeter Bradshaw's film of the weekDrama filmsShirley HendersonMaxine PeakePeter MullanScotlandNeurodiversityreviewsShareReuse this content"

There are 11 scenes, non-chronological, that travel 70 years around the life of Mary Page Marlowe, an accountant, wife to three husbands, mother to two children and daughter of an alcoholic, who becomes perilously dependent on drink herself. She too is portrayed by five actors (and a doll).Comparison between the plays might be unfair – they form cubist portraits of two very different women, living in separate continents and times, yet still one casts a shadow over the other. This play by the celebrated American playwright Tracy Letts has many searing scenes, and is highly watchable with always excellent dialogue, but it is not quite so polyphonic or as whole.View image in fullscreenCubist portrait … Andrea Riseborough and Paul Thornley in Mary Page Marlowe.Photograph: Manuel HarlanIts stardust is certainly greater, though. If London theatre has seen an influx of Hollywood royalty of late, it couldhardly get any more regalthan Susan Sarandon, who plays the protagonist at her oldest alongside Andrea Riseborough, who is a midlife Mary.Like Letts’ 2007 Pulitzer prize-winningAugust: Osage County, this dramarevolves around the world of the family with all its fractiousness, spiky humour and love-hate.It opens with Mary announcing her divorce to her children and flips backwards or forwards, not to draw a line of correspondence between scenes, or explain how Mary got from here to there, but merely, it seems, to show her in different ages and states. They are flashing memories, some quiet, others explosive.It is beautifully directed byMatthew Warchus, who elicits magnificent performances from the ensemble. Sarandon performs with ease, assurance and total ownership of her character; Riseborough, in scraped back ponytail, is astonishing as a woman whose life has hurtled off-course. Rosy McEwen, as an unfaithful wife who feels like an actor in her own life, is a scintillating, dangerous force on stage. The two youngest Marys – the 12-year-old trying to impress her heavy-drinking mother, played by Alisha Weir, and Eleanor Worthington-Cox’s hopeful high-school pupil – are also a pleasure to watch, as is the entire cast.View image in fullscreenDangerous force … Rosy McEwen, right, with Ronan Raftery in Mary Page Marlowe.Photograph: Manuel HarlanThe scenes are powerful in themselves, with a naturalism that captures the testiness of intimate relationships – from a sweet scene of a sleepover with friends who predict a future of bright hopes for Mary, to confessions of unhappiness to a therapist. One of the most moving features Sarandon as an elderly Mary, pressed up against death, on the verge of articulating something momentous, then withholding it.That, in a frustrating sense, is what Letts does with his play. Staged in the round, Rob Howell’s set is nicely gestural – a bottle of booze is never far out of reach. The round shows Mary from all sides, in theory, yet you do not see her clearly at all. She remains elusive, with caesura between scenes that are too wide to allow a bigger picture to form. Maybe that is the point. But it leaves you wanting to know – and crucially tofeel– more.Where The Years suggested that we, as individuals, contain multitudes, the point of the five actors here is more slippery. Important questions are asked through them: do we ever know ourselves? Are we Shakespearean actors merely assuming parts? And how does the assuming of a role intersect with the conditioning that women imbibe and that Mary wants to rebel against but ultimately submits to? The play raises these questions and then lets them fall away, unanswered. And is it showing Mary as a mere actor on life’s stage, or what lies beneath that mask? I’m not sure.At the Old Vic theatre, London, until 1 NovemberExplore more on these topicsTheatreOld Vic TheatreSusan SarandonAndrea RiseboroughMatthew WarchusreviewsShareReuse this content"

It’s as disorienting as it is immersiveAlexis PetridisThu 9 Oct 2025 07.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 9 Oct 2025 15.07 EDTShareSickElixir is not an album much interested in gently easing the listener into its darkly claustrophobic world. The first thing you hear is roughly approximate to the distressing sound of someone alternately gasping for breath and attempting to clear their passages of phlegm. It’s joined by a distorted bass drum overlaid with a metal-on-metal clank in lieu of a snare. There’s a weird noise somewhere between radio interference and the sound of fabric tearing, some incomprehensible, sonically warped and doom-laden guttural chanting, and harsh electronic tones that churn and screech. All this is in the opening minute of the first track: notice is served that Jamie Roberts’ latest album is probably not for everyone.View image in fullscreenThe artwork for SickElixir.This will hardly come as a shock to anyone with prior knowledge of his oeuvre. From the moment he started releasing music as Blawan – beginning in 2010 withFram, a twitchy, unsettling take on UK bass released by revered label Hessle Audio – Roberts has cut an impressively unbiddable figure. His style was marked by an industrial darkness that even seeped into his rework of Brandy’s lush R&B track I Wanna Be Down – something he has suggested may have to do with his spectacularly grim-sounding teenage job in a maggot farm, when his working days were soundtracked by the clanging of an industrial mincer. His biggest track to date is 2012’s Why They Hide Their Bodies Under My Garage, a relentless techno cut featuring a dive-bombing bassline and a warped sample of the Fugees. It crossed over into more mainstream DJs’ sets, albeit occasionally remixed into more palatable shapes.Roberts’ response was to stop releasing music as Blawan for the next three years. His 2018 debut album, Wet Will Always Dry, steadfastly declined to do the things that dance producers usually do when their canvas is expanded from the limitations of a 12in single (display the breadth of their musical range; shift styles and tempos; maybe throw in a couple of high-profile guest vocalists; attempt to create something that works as a home listening experience) and instead dished up eight unremitting slabs of dense, tough, club-focused techno. Recent years have seen Roberts work in a variety of styles – including the modular synth-driven beats of the album he recorded with Pariah as Karenn, and the industrial/doom metal made as one half of duo Persher – none of which much suggested a man desperate to break through to a wider audience.Blawan: Rabbit Hole – videoNor has the music he has released since signing to XL, a much larger record company than Roberts has traditionally worked with. SickElixir is certainly a more varied album than Wet Will Always Dry, rhythmically and musically. It’s surprisingly free of four-four beats, instead deploying rhythms that feel rooted in hip-hop, electro or, on Style Teef, footwork, and occasionally they have the glitchy, irregular quality of an old Aphex Twin or μ-Ziq tune. But the album is also heavier going emotionally. Wet Will Always Dry was aimed at the dancefloor: as dark-hued as it was, it allowed a certain sense of cathartic release. While SickElixir – which was recorded in the wake of a struggle with addiction and the overdose deaths of several friends – is served up in bite-size three-minute chunks, they’re crammed with sound, wilfully oppressive, spattered with sudden, jolting disruptions.‘Yes, there was a riot, but it was great’: Cabaret Voltaire on violent gigs, nuclear noise – and returning to mark 50 yearsRead moreThe vocals are frequently guttural growls or hoarse, panicked whispers. They’re usually manipulated to the point at which you can’t make out what they’re saying, but you get the feeling it’s probably not good news. You might call Rabbit Hole psychedelic – its gushes of electronic noise and looped vocals are certainly disorientating – but if it evokes anything about the drug experience it’s the moment of sudden, queasy propulsion when the chemicals start working a little too dramatically. On Don’t Worry We Happy and the title track, it feels as if Roberts is warping the cheerfully daft sounds of old happy hardcore rave until they sound mocking and nightmarish.It’s an album on which the atmosphere is so intense and all-pervading that even the most innocuous sounds take on an ominous air. The fluttering synth arpeggio on Creature Brigade feels eerie even before the entire track collapses into disturbing ambience. “Be quiet! Be quiet!” hisses a voice during Weirdos United: it feels threatening in context, but it’s apparently a recording of nothing more troubling than Roberts reacting to his pet dog’s snoring. When SickElixir ends, it feels like coming up for air, which gives you an idea of how immersive and overwhelming an experience it is. A headlong dive into a troubled mind working overtime, it isn’t a journey you might want to undertake on a nightly basis. That said, it’s a journey worth taking.This week Alexis listened toSay She She – Under the SunDependably fantastic Brooklyn alt-disco trio stir slow-jam Philly soul into their cocktail of influences, with heady results.Explore more on these topicsMusicAlexis Petridis's album of the weekElectronic musicExperimental musicreviewsShareReuse this content"

Perhaps in a different concert it would have been perfectly possible to listen to his colossal orchestral workBecome Oceanand find it merely beautiful. Here, as the culmination of a brilliantly thought-through sequence played by the BBC Symphony Orchestra and conducted by Dalia Stasevska, its unsettling aspects struck home powerfully, too.All three works here were the kind that require the language of physics to describe them. This was music of ineluctable forces moving against each other, whether heavy or delicate: shifting tectonic plates and drifting clouds of gas.Anna Thorvaldsdottir’s ARCHORA, premieredat the BBC Proms in 2022, took us immediately into this listening world, the music first scattering high-frequency sounds against an elemental low note, then creating elusively shifting textures around a single, veering pitch. It’s a hugely effective work, simultaneously teeming and glacial.And, like so much written in the last 60 years, it owes at least a nod toLigeti’s Atmosphères– which required an even larger orchestra on stage. Here were sounds that seemed to come from the air or the ground rather than from any musical instrument. The extremes of pitch and loudness that had the players seated near the piccolo and percussion sticking their fingers in their ears for protection had the audience’s knuckles turning white, too.Out of the final silence of Atmosphères, Become Ocean emerged without a pause. It’s a 45-minute musical palindrome in which three cross-currents – strings, wind, brass – ebb and flow, creating troughs and huge peaks out of the interference. On one level it feels stable, even peaceful – and yet there’s an unyielding quality to this rise and fall that is profoundly disquieting. Benign and menacing sounds pass by each other, seemingly unrelated yet part of the same body: xylophones and harps – four of them, two upfront and two at the back – bubble above threatening bass drum. Stasevska shaped those long surges with absolute security and a clear view of the horizon; for the rest of us, the experience was immersive, the waves all-encompassing.On BBC Sounds until 7 NovemberExplore more on these topicsClassical musicBBC Symphony OrchestrareviewsShareReuse this content"

The words, spray-painted in fiery-red ballooned letters, leap out of a colourful mural that wraps around one side of a localSons of Restbuilding, a place where retired war veterans once met and socialised. To the side looms an image of the late poet and writer, his face full of expression and thought. For a moment, it feels as if he’s there with you.A couple of years earlier, and he may well have been. “Seriously, you could come into Handsworth Park and he’d just be walking through, just leisurely. Benjamin, he’d sit with you, he had time for you,” says Marcia Dunkley, one of the founders of the organisationBlack Heritage Walks Network, which commissioned the mural.It’s a chalky blue-skied August day in Birmingham, and while many of the city’s residents have flocked to the centre for the annual Caribbean music and food festival, I’m on a walking tour in Handsworth, the neighbourhood where much of the creative legacy of Birmingham’s Caribbean population was first felt.The tour, launched in 2018 by the Black Heritage Walks Network, explores the history and legacy of the influx of Caribbean migrants who settled in Handsworth after the second world war.View image in fullscreenA railway bridge in Handsworth with a mural commemorating south Asian immigrants who fought for equal working conditions.Photograph: Andrew Fox/The GuardianThe walk largely takes place along Handsworth’s Soho Road, a bustling high street north-west of the city centre where elaborate saris and glistening wedding jewellery spill out of shops and on to pavements. Fifty years ago, the high street, now dominated by south Asian traders, wore a different face.“Black-owned, Black-owned, Black-owned,” says Dunkley, pointing at an array of mismatched buildings that were once the nightclubs, restaurants, law firms and banks that made up the Black economy in Birmingham, after thousands migrated to the neighbourhood from the Caribbean in the 1950s and 60s.The community elders stopped the neo-Nazis, the skinheads, coming up here. It was murderous. It was brutal’Marcia DunkleyOn any given day, they are buildings that might not warrant a second glance. Take Garvey House – a neglected and disused Victorian house, with a faded white painted front and boarded-up windows. Named after Jamaica’s national hero Marcus Garvey, the space once brimmed with life, offering temporary accommodation to waves of migrants arriving for the first time in the city. The only remnant of its past life is a faint sign above the door.Black Heritage Walking Network was born out of the ambition of three history buffs, frustrated by Birmingham’s lack of recognition as a city steeped in Black history and heritage. Since creating theMadibatour in Handsworth, named after Nelson Mandela’s famous visit to the area (Madiba was his Xhosa clan name) the company has developed a plethora of walks, exhibitions, and educational workshops that highlight the history and legacy of the African-Caribbean community in Birmingham.“People who want to know about Bob Marley and Malcolm X and so on, if you don’t tell them, then they’ll just go to London to find it … People are used to the culture in London and having access to all of that at their fingertips, which means they don’t want to come to Birmingham,” says Dawn Carr, who co-founded the network.View image in fullscreenA mural in Handsworth Park depicts African-Caribbean musicians from Handsworth including Steel Pulse and Musical Youth.Photograph: Andrew Fox/The GuardianAlong Soho Road, unkempt and derelict buildings are contrasted with an array of colourful murals, commissioned over the years, to highlight the neighbourhood’s diverse and evolving identity. On Soho Bridge, a hand-painted mural shows Strikers in Saris to commemorate a group of south Asian women who famously protestedpoor working conditionsat the Grunwick film processing factory in the late 1970s.Close to the mural of Benjamin Zephaniah in Handsworth Park, is a brightly painted tribute of 13 Birmingham-born reggae artists that Dunkley brings to life by playing Steel Pulse’s Handsworth Revolution and UB40’s Food for Thought out of a portable speaker.Where the rich cultural history of Handsworth escapes its outward appearance, Dunkley’s evocative storytelling brings it to life. Her passion for uncovering the lost history of Birmingham streets pours out in theatrical re-enactments and poised reflections on the ways we are taught the past.While narrating the rich cultural and economic life of old Handsworth, Dunkley is careful not to gloss over the more painful realities of the racism and brutality that marked many residents’ lives.Remembering that the Black and Irish communities ran 24-hour blues parties hosted in the interlinked cellars of houses along Soho Road known as shebeens, she’s quick to remind us that this was often the only nightlife available to residents, who risked returning “blue and beaten” if they ventured into the city centre.View image in fullscreenA south Asian bridal shop on Soho Road.Photograph: Andrew Fox/The GuardianIn the same vein, we are frequently reminded of the strength and resilience of the community. “What you had were elders of the community … who would literally stand vigilante along here,” says Marcia at the edge of a road leading to the city centre.“They stopped the youths from going down there. But they also stopped the neo-Nazis, the skinheads, coming up here, because that’s what was happening. Big clashes there. It was murderous. It was brutal.”You could come into Handsworth Park and Benjamin Zephaniah would just be walking through, just leisurelySome of the most painful accounts of the difficult reality for Handsworth residents are discussed outside the austere redbrick building with tall, narrow windows and stone lintels that was once the local police station. Then called Thornhill Road police station, Dunkley recalls a passage from Benjamin Zephaniah’s autobiography, where he describes a room with dreadlocks pinned to the wall, kept by police as trophies after alleged brutality.Walking tours can at times feel like lectures, only with heavier legs and a burgeoning craving to sit down. On this tour, Marcia keeps us alert by making us work. At every twist and turn in the narrative, she interrogates the group for answers, sparking debate and conversation.The tour ends at Handsworth leisure centre, the unexpected site of a visit from Nelson Mandela in October 1993. When news spread of his visit, residents of Handsworth flocked in droves to the sports hall– some even camping out the night before – to hear him speak. According to Dunkley, it was a visit city leaders fervently tried to block, fearing it might spark unrest in the part of Birmingham they referred to as the “ghetto”.“But where’s the statue? Where’s the narration board?” says Dunkley, voicing her frustration at the lack of any physical commemoration to mark the event, a theme she reflects on throughout the tour. “Where’s the celebration?”Black Heritage Walks Network offers guided tours all year round, weather permitting.

If any of those collections of words mean anything to you (keep your double entendres to yourself, please), you may have fuzzy yet painful memories of bag-in-box wine. The cheapness and the format – not to mention the sheer volume you can buy it for – makes bag-in-box ripe for drinking games.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.These fond (?) memories might result in an assumption that all bag-in-box wine is of a lesser quality, something designed for inexpensive and quick intoxication, rather than tasteful enjoyment. But interest in bag-in-box is on the rise, with the UK market expected torise to more than £300m by 2030 – almost double what it was in 2021.Why the spike in interest? My best guess is that people are drinking less and, once opened, your average bag-in-box will stay fresh for about six whole weeks. Many of us are (or have recently become) the type of drinker who savours a single glass of wine every so often after work, but never drink enough in the week to finish an entire bottle, so the rest is often given as a little treat to the sink.The sorts of wines you’re likely to find in bags are what you’d expect: bright, fresh, relatively simple stuff that’s designed to be drunk within weeks, not years. And although a boxed wine will last longer once it’s open than wine in a bottle, the plastic used in production ispermeable, meaning the wine will gradually spoil due to contact with oxygen, even if it remains unopened.It’s smart buying decisions that determine what wines make it into my bags. My pal Freddy Bulmer is a buyer atthe Wine Society, a place with a bag-in-box offering that impresses me with each and every new addition, so I asked him why they’re putting so much stock in the category. “One thing that we really care about in the wine industry is the sustainability angle. Bag-in-box can be a solution to a lot of those industry concerns. For example, shipping over a huge, 24,000-litre flexitank full of wine that can then be put into bags in the UK is far more sustainable than sending thousands of individual glass bottles around the world.”Large retailers such as the Wine Society and our major supermarkets have embraced the format to meet the needs of the modern drinker, but there are some brands that have been founded on selling solely bag-in-box, which if nothing else is an expression of confidence in the future of the category. One such business isBobo Wines, which sells beautifully designed, handwritten boxes (I’m a sucker for a good bit of packaging design) that look as if they’ve been plucked straight out of the cellar by Bobo’s buyer, the sommelier, writer and educator Amber Gardner.

Established in 1959 by Aldo Albanesi, and now run by his sons Adriano and Alessandro, Albanesi is wondrous also for its size. Behind an 11-window shopfront lies almost 500 sq m of shop floor, and a small maze of laboratories in which almost everything that can be made is made: bread, pizza, pies, cakes, biscuits, fresh egg pasta, sauces, baked pasta and other dishes that are ready to eat. The snake of glass-fronted counters also hold cheese, other dairy products, cured meats, and vegetables and olives preserved in various ways, while the shelves are packed with everyday provisions of good and practical quality. This is a shop with something for everyone.It also sellsacini dipepe, a tiny pasta shaped like peppercorns and made of durum wheat, andpastina, another small pasta used mostly in soups or for stuffing into vegetables. Acini di pepe was the reason we first visited the shop six years ago, on the recommendation of a colleague, and at a time when I was writinga book about pastaand therefore trying to get my hands on as many shapes as possible. On that first visit I boughtstelline(stars),alfabeto,puntine(dots) andrisoni, of course, which is pretty much the same shape as orzo, only not called orzo in Italy, because that word means “barley”.I am repeating myself, I know, when I say that bags of pastina are the most satisfying bags of pasta to take from the shelf and move around in your hand, because they slide in much the same way as a beanbag does when it meets a bum. I also like measuring out small pasta shapes, raining them into the scale or, if you are sure enough, straight into a pan of boiling water. To make this week’s recipe, you need 300g of any small pasta shape (peppercorns, stars, letters, points, orzo) to fill eight red pepper boats. You also need to par-cook the pasta for half the recommended cooking time, then drain very well and spread out, if possible: you don’t want it to continue cooking, because it has to spend another 40 minutes in the oven.The peppers can be eaten straight away, but they’ll sit happily for hours, days even; just keep them in the fridge if the wait is longer than a few hours, and remember to take them out in advance. They are wondrous eaten at room temperature (or quickly reheated), especially after a long day.Red peppers stuffed with orzo, tuna, capers and herbsServes44 mediumredor/and yellow peppers, all even in size300g orzo, or other very small pasta shapeExtra-virgin olive oilButter1 red onion, peeled and diced1garlic clove, peeled and minced1 handful fresh parsley, minced1 medium-sized tomato, or several cherry tomatoes, finely chopped100g tuna packed in olive oil, drained1 heaped tbspsmall capers2 anchovy fillets, mincedCut the peppers in half lengthways through the stalks, scrape out the seeds and trim away any white pith inside. Boil the orzo in salted water for a half the recommended cooking time (if it suggests, say, 10 minutes, cook it for only five), then drain well.Working in a frying pan, warm a few tablespoons of olive oil and a bit of butter, then fry the onion and garlic until soft. Add the par-cooked orzo, parsley, tomato, tuna, capers and anchovies, then taste and season with salt as needed (it probably won’t need much) and generously with black pepper.Fill the pepper boats almost to the brim with the orzo mixture and arrange them snugly in a suitable baking tray. Spoon three tablespoons of water and three tablespoons of oil into the bottom of the trat, cover loosely but completely with foil, and bake at 180C (160C fan)/350F/gas 4 for 40 minutes, removing the foil for the last 10 minutes. Before serving, finish by zigzagging each pepper with a bit of olive oil, or spooning over some melted butter and anchovies, or thinning some basil pesto with extra-virgin olive oil, spooning that over the peppers and topping each half-pepper with a basil leaf.This article was amended on 9 October 2025 to include the oven temperature.Explore more on these topicsItalian food and drinkA kitchen in RomeFoodVegetablesPastaMain courseStarterFishrecipesShareReuse this content"
