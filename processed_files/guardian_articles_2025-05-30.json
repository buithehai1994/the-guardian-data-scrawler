The Sex and the City spin off hits its strideThe series has given up trying to squeeze its characters into the modern age and is content to justbe.Fans of the original will sink into it as if it is made of marshmallows and airRebecca NicholsonFri 30 May 2025 17.00 EDTShareIt all fell into place for me around the shoe montage. Roughly halfway through the third season ofAnd Just Like That, there is an on-screen procession of footwear, strident and unapologetically far too long. Carrie has been accused by her downstairs neighbour of walking too loudly on the floor above his bed. A parade of sandals, boots and mules strut back and forth across a polished and expensive wooden floor. I watched this march of the stilettos and began to suspect that the storyline had been retrofitted to the idea of simply showing off the shoes. And I realised that, even if that is the case, I don’t mind at all, because And Just Like That has found its feet.It took a while for it to get there, but finally, the Sex and the City spin-off feels comfortable in its own skin. If the first two seasons were fondly received but sometimes excruciating exercises in attempting to squeeze its characters into the modern age, then this feels like a loosening of the belt. The leads are no longer trying to be anything other than themselves: absurdly rich New Yorkers in their 50s, troubled mostly by the burdens of making sure they spend enough time with their friends. Life’s primary emotional entanglements – love, work, family – are present, sure, but they hum away lightly, like ambient noise, any sharp corners dulled by vast riches.Having sold her single-girl apartment, Carrie is now living in a sparsely furnished, absolutely massive Gramercy Park townhouse. She is still with Aidan, though he remains in Virginia, taking care of his troubled teenage son. It is a long distance relationship, with the emphasis on distance. Charlotte is still a happily married mother of two teenagers, with a successful art-dealing business, though early in the season, her dog gets cancelled. Lisa is trying to get her documentary about pioneering Black women off the ground, but the stress of it means she is sleep-talking, so her husband, Herbert, has to move to the spare room. Seema, the not entirely convincing Samantha replacement, is trying to assert her worth in the workplace. Miranda is dating again, and looking for an apartment, and is a human rights lawyer, very much in that order of importance.You make a choice, with And Just Like That, of how to consume it. You can look at it and see its Nero-like qualities, stark and vivid. You could accuse its fluorescent fairytales of fiddling while Trump’s America burns. Much of Carrie’s ennui comes from whether or not she will buy a dining table that costs almost $7,000, so that she can begin to fill her still-empty mansion. The show scoffs at tourists in New York, rural life, the countryside, items of clothing that cost less than an average month’s rent.Yet I find myself sinking into And Just Like That as if it is made of marshmallows and air. It is funny, warm, and self-aware enough to just about get away with it. Miranda’s ex, Che, has departed from the women’s lives and in the six episodes released to critics, they aren’t mentioned at all. Che was And Just Like That trying too hard, and in their absence, there is a sense that it has stopped putting on a front. Now, it has a kind of gauzy acceptance that these women are fully ensconced in the rarefied world of Manhattan’s wealthy, middle-aged elite. The hardest they have to try is when endlessly discussing what emojis in text messages are really meant to say.It should be unbearable. But the show’s devotion to the fantasy of dedicated, lifelong, rock-solid friendship is what gives it a heart, and in turn, that gives its more egregious vulgarities a free pass. Most Sex and the City fans have been following the lives of Carrie, Charlotte and Miranda since 1998, and there is a specific comfort in seeing them (without Samantha, of course) operating as a unit, 27 years later. Every episode rolls on, as each minor drama softly bumps into another minor drama, with stakes so low that you have to crouch to see them. It is all so steady, so frictionless, as smooth as the foreheads of the Upper East Side.I have no idea if it is good or not. I truly, genuinely, don’t know. It remains filled with Samantha-esque quips and puns that, like the shoe montage, appear to have been worked backwards, as if the gags come first, and the plots are created to fit them. But if there was a reluctant fondness that came when watching the first two seasons, then that fondness now appears much more readily. Their concerns are so gentle, their worries so slight, that to watch it is to be lulled into a state of easy comfort. The stilettos march on, as they always did.And Just Like That season three aired on Sky Comedy and is available on NOW.Explore more on these topicsAnd Just Like ThatTV reviewTelevisionSarah Jessica ParkerreviewsShareReuse this content"

But he understands something Keir Starmer doesn’tJonathan FreedlandThe shadow justice secretary is eyeing Kemi Badenoch’s job – but he’s released a video that highlights a weakness in our technocratic PMFri 30 May 2025 12.42 EDTLast modified on Fri 30 May 2025 13.42 EDTShareThere is no shortage of reasons to dislike and dismiss Robert Jenrick. He is, after all, the former immigration minister who ordered that a centre for unaccompanied child asylum-seekers paint over itsmurals of cartoon characters, lest the child refugees got the wrong idea and thought they were being welcomed and had at last reached a place of safety.We certainly wouldn’t want to take lectures on law-breaking from Jenrick, given that the former housing secretaryacted unlawfullyin rushing through approval for a development by the Conservative donor Richard Desmond, thereby saving the onetime porn publisher more than £40m. Nor would he be our go-to guy on matters of ripping off the public, not after it was revealed in 2020 that heclaimed £100,000 in expensesfor athirdhome. To say nothing of his service in a Boris Johnson administration that happily funnelled at least£1bn of taxpayers’ moneyto assorted chancers lucky enough to have a friend in government, thereby securing for themselves a place in the VIP lane when it came to bidding for lucrative contracts making personal protective equipment or PPE.All of that makes it tempting to wave aside Jenrick’s latest stunt, avideo of himself challenging fare dodgersat a London Underground station, calling them “mate” and demanding that they go back and pay for their journey. The transparency of his motive only strengthens that impulse. He wants Kemi Badenoch’s job: we know that, because he tried to get it last time, when she defeated him.What’s more, his pitch is that he will be the Tory leader who outflanks Reform UK on the right, nullifying that party’s threat by offering voters the same brew of nationalist populism they can get from Nigel Farage. That’s why he speaks so often, and so unbendingly, on immigration and why he includes an unexpected item in the list of menaces with which he closes the fare-dodging video: “It’s the same with bike theft, phone theft, tool theft, shoplifting, drugs in town centres, weird Turkish barber shops. It’s all chipping away at society.”Weird Turkish barber shops. It leaps out, because it’s the only thing in that list that isn’t a crime. Ah, comes the response, but many of those places are suspected fronts for criminal activity, specifically money laundering. OK, but the same suspicion hovers over the “American candy” stores that are similarly proliferating on the high street; why didn’t Jenrick mention them? Could it be that “American” doesn’t quite have the same bite as “Turkish”? Jenrick is an extremely online politician, one who will be familiar with the“Yookay” meme, which suggests a Britain gone to the dogs: shabby, scuzzy, lawless and threatening – and that often likes toillustrate this descent into antisocial malaisewith pictures of young Black and brown men. The “Turkish” reference fits that narrative quite nicely.1:05Robert Jenrick confronts fare dodgers in London Tube stations – videoSo there are good reasons for anti-racists and progressives to dismiss Jenrick and this latest bit of agitprop, seeing it as a cynical play either for Badenoch’s job or, perhaps, Sadiq Khan’s, given that the explicit target of the video is the London mayor. And yet, it would be unwise to do that too hastily. There is a lesson here for liberals, the Labour government and all those who want to see nationalist populism defeated.Because Jenrick is on to something here. Toxic messenger though he might be, his message will land. Put simply, people despise, with vehemence, what would officially be classified as petty crime and antisocial behaviour. Listen to those who have agreed with Jenrick on this latest point, including mothers speaking of pushing toddlers in buggies, only to be shoved aside by fare-dodgers seizing on the chance to slip through an open gate.But it goes deeper than physical intimidation. The resentment resides in the sense of unfairness: you paid, so why shouldn’t they? You put out all your bins, so why should someone else get away with dumping rubbish on the street? The anger this generates is not solely about what they’ve not done, but about what youhavedone.Crimeor antisocial conduct of this kind makes you feel as if you’ve been a mug, a sucker, for obeying the rules.That sentiment corrodes the rule of law and is politically poisonous, as Jenrick should know. He is out of government partly because of it. The anger at Johnson originated in his breaking of lockdown rules, but the depth of that anger was because he had, in the process, made so many feel foolish for having kept them. It is that fury which Jenrick is tapping into. “But everyone else has to pay,” he says to one fare dodger, and it’s the heart of the matter.Some of the hostile responses Jenrick has generated have upbraided him for making so much about a few quid here or there, when much greater larcenies are being committed. It’s quite true that it would take many decades of committed barrier-jumping by today’s fare-dodgers to steal a sum close to the £15.3bn fortune taken from taxpayers’ pockets in Covid contracts deemed to “carry a high risk of corruption”. But that’s to skip past human psychology. We react to the crime we can see in front of us with more intensity than to one distant and abstract. Besides, there is at least a criminological argument, popularised as “broken windows theory”, to the view that if you deal swiftly with small crimes, you deter criminals from committing larger ones.The narrow lessonKeir Starmermight take from this is that he needs to act soon on fare evasion and the like. The broader, more pertinent one would be about politics itself. Sometimes politicians are at their most effective when they don’t pass a law or spend money, but simply give voice to voters’ anxieties. Donald Trump does it even now, acting as a commentator on patterns and trends in US society as if he were a pundit rather than the president. Farage does it all the time; Tony Blair used to do it, even from Downing Street.The current PM’s technocratic instinct is to say nothing about a problem unless he has a plan or policy to fix it. But sometimes it’s effective just to make an argument from the “bully pulpit” you have as head of government. That’s what leaders, as opposed to managers, do. It’s a way of signalling to voters who you are, what you believe and, most important, whose side you’re on.Starmer would be wise to do it more. It might mean a nod to the right, calling, say, for the return of a sense of shame to those guilty of selfish, antisocial behaviour, or a nod to the left, publicly naming and shaming, say,the water bosseswho have been similarly selfish and antisocial by taking gargantuan bonuses even as they beg for bailouts.Awkward, I admit, to have to take lessons in politics from the likes ofRobert Jenrick. But this one is useful. And, best of all, Starmer didn’t even have to pay for it.Jonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Its team talks teenage sex work, nostalgia for Tony Blair, and why TV drama is so posh it’s like Jane AustenFri 30 May 2025 08.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 30 May 2025 12.51 EDTShareWhen the BBC was casting its adaptation ofParis Lees’s autobiography,What It Feels Like for a Girl, it wasn’t the only one wrestling with how to find the right actor to play the lead in a biopic. “Cher did an interview,” smiles Lees, “and she said: ‘We just can’t find somebody that’s Cher.’ I was like: ‘Same, girl. I hear your struggles.’ So me and Cher have been going through it.” Sitting next to Lees is the actor they went with, Ellis Howard, whom you may remember as the sapling Ivan VI in HBO seriesCatherine the Great, but who you will never have seen being this luminous.“In the beginning, we were looking for a trans person,” Lees says. She and Howard are sharing a Zoom screen, and it’s not so much that they look similar as that they both look so cinematic, they seem to match – “But then I just knew, the moment I saw Ellis, that this cheeky, cheeky person could do it.”Lees is known in the public eye via a series of triumphant firsts: the first trans columnist for Vogue, the first trans woman to present on Radio 1, on Channel 4. But her early life was harsh, brutal at times. She was relentlessly bullied at school for being gay, and carried the weight of her father’s homophobia, expressed in both formless anger and embarrassment. She became a “rent boy” when she was 14, but was astonished when she read, in a review of her book inGraziathat she’d been abused. “Then I thought: ‘Hang on a minute. What else would you call that?’ It took me a while to realise that was abusive. When people are vulnerable, when they’re told they’re worthless, that they’re almost half a person, you seek validation in the wrong places. It makes me incredibly sad, but it was really important to show my perspective at that time, not my perspective now.”View image in fullscreenTrue to life … What It Feels Like for a Girl author Paris Lees.Photograph: Sophia Spring/The GuardianHoward’s performance is exquisite: subtle and daring, true to the fact that it would be years before the teenage sex work processed as a violation – and at the time Lees was thrilled about earning all those fivers. “When you force people into the shadows, don’t be surprised when they go fucking dark,” Howard says. “You’ve got to silence the part of your brain that goes: ‘I am an adult, I am a leftwing progressive.’ You’ve got to go to a place of wonderment and curiosity.”Paris Lees’s perspective in the book, which comes across as strongly on the screen, is joyful – this is an incredibly buoyant coming-of-age story, as Howard describes. “When we were cast, all of us felt like we had touched gold, here. Whether it’s our queerness, whether it’s our class, whether it’s the scars we’ve been given that make us feel so seen by it, everyone came to give it their all. How often do you get these unicorn projects, that feel so alive? It felt so rare.”Lees gives her adolescent self the pseudonym Byron, and their story opens in 2000, when things were bleak as hell for a gay teenager in a suburban, declining bit of Nottinghamshire. But this is very much not how they felt at the time: “I definitely had a sense that things are getting better,” says Lees. “We thought this was the end of history. I had this sense that people were living longer, wages were going up, flights were getting cheaper, they were cloning sheep. It felt like there was going to be more democracy, there was hope, there was a future. We were going to get there with gay rights. I didn’t dare to believe we’d get there with the other stuff.”It’s beautifully told in the drama, through friendships with divas and ketamine in nightclubs, that to be young in that era may have felt like a train wreck, but didn’t feel hopeless. Howard, who was born in 1997, chips in, “I’m nostalgic for a time I wasn’t born in. Listening to P talk about the possibility of Blair and Brown, talk about a time when the NHS functioned, when school ceilings weren’t caving in on people’s heads, maybe I’ve doctored that into my brain, but I feel like I can remember a time when progress was possible. Although if I’m honest, my political awareness really began with austerity.”If homophobic bullying was a thing of the past by the 2010s, “God, no one told my fucking school,” he says. “No one told Norris Green in Liverpool. I was definitely ostracised. I come from a family of ‘aaaah’ blokes [impossible to fully convey the meaning, or mad charm of that “aaaah” - sort of aggro and in-your-face]. I just had this unwavering sense of, I won’t be bullied. You’re not gonna get me. One of the reasons why I felt so seen by the book, is because this is a kid who was resilient to a mythic level. Your conditions can harden you. That was my experience of school, anyway.”View image in fullscreen‘I’m nostalgic for a time I wasn’t born in’ says Howard.Photograph: Enda Bowe/BBC/HeraThe double-edged nostalgia for that time – post-industrial drudgery leavened by the smell of escape – is particularly poignant to watch now. Nobody in 2000 (trust me on this, I was there) would have predicted that 25 years later, trans people would be openly vilified in the media and drag queens castigated as perverts. It feels as if we inched forward to Scandinavia on LGBTQI+ rights, only to hurtle back to Weimar. Lees says it’s more complicated than that. “It feels like there’s been a weird reversal. The public conversation in the media and politics has become very toxic. But think back: when did you ever see somebody working in Boots, that was trans, in the year 2000? When was your GP trans? When were trans people ever allowed to participate in life or society? Nobody had a job; you either had to be a prostitute or you had to not be out.”She breaks off – “I’m a little bit guarded about this, because it’s obviously relevant, but I don’t want everything I do to be framed within trans activism. I hate it when people call me a trans activist. I’m not involved in activism now. Obviously, I am trans. I can’t escape that. I feel like I could have died, somebody could have shot me, I could have been revived on the operating table, and the headline would still be about being trans.”Both Lees and Howard see What It Feels Like … as being an exploration of the marginalisation of poverty at least as much as it is about trans identity – if not more so. Again, it’s complicated: sometimes sex and gender identity cancels out class identity, in the sense that Lees thinks “being trans has possibly opened doors for me that wouldn’t have [otherwise] been opened, to a working-class person”. Other times, the world demands that you pick a lane. “Often times, as an actor, as a writer, I’m thinking, who am I today? Am I this scrappy working-class kid? Or am I the sensitive queer boy? And those things can’t reconcile. To be swallowed in this industry, one has to present oneself in a fixed way. Who gets to live authentically is so determined by your class.” She adds: “It’s a really big part of my identity, just coming from a scarcity mindset. When you grow up and you’ve got nothing, that has a huge effect on how I live my life, how I think about things, my sense of internal safety and security.”View image in fullscreenDivas licence … (from left) Laquarn Lewis, Hannah Jones, Ellis Howard, Alex Thomas-Smith and Adam Ali in What It Feels Like for a Girl.Photograph: Enda Bowe/BBC/Hera“Drama is so fucking posh,” Lees continues – not with indignation, almost amused, like she knows she speaks for pretty well everyone but the rest of the world are too polite to mention it. “I’m just so sick of it. We love all the actors with the posh accents, I get it, but let’s just make the space for some other people. It’s so boring, the Jane Austenness of it all, the comedy of manners; let’s have some real messy stories about real shit that happens. I love that we’ve got so many working-class actors on this show. The only place working-class people are represented is reality TV. I’ve had enough of the double-barrelled names. Working-class people are lyrical, we’re just not given a voice.”And if it’s a rare oversight by the class gatekeepers that this messy, exuberant story got on to TV, it also breaks out of a predictable aesthetic. “It’s so gorgeous to be in a working-class project that is extended beyond the kitchen sink, something that has so much colour and is so visually arresting,” says Howard. “It has a cinematic feel and scale that is normally only lent to middle-class stories [but is here] given to a working-class story set in the Midlands.”The whole thing has been a white-knuckle ride from the start, Lees says, “A bit like if they said: ‘We’re gonna take a picture of you naked. It’s going to be displayed in public. But don’t worry, we’re going to get good people in, you’ll have lots of creative control.’ Are you ever going to be happy with that picture? This is made out of my core memories.” It has led, however, to Lees’s relationship with Howard – part spirit-animal, part younger-self transformed – as well as some other beautiful performances. Both single out Laura Haddock as Byron’s mother, who Lees says managed to powerfully channel her mum, without necessarily looking very alike. And the ensemble of fallen divas – endearing, spiky performances from Laquarn Lewis and Hannah Jones, was “such a headfuck for me”, Lees says, as “there are the actual fallen divas, the real people. Then there are the characters that I created, based on them, in the book. Then there’s the TV interpretations, and the actors playing them, who formed their own breakaway group. A lot of what you see on screen, that is just them fucking around.”What It Feels Like for a Girl is on BBC iPlayer from 3 June.Explore more on these topicsDramaTelevisionLGBTQ+ rightsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Several, in fact.Someone alerted me that a memecoin called Dork Nerd Geek ($DNG) had been minted with a picture of my face, and it already had a market cap (the total value of all coins in circulation) of $29,000. Twenty minutes later it was $100,000. An hour later it was $800,000.I had no idea what was going on, but I did know that “Dork Nerd Geek” was the nicknameAndrew Tategave me because I’ve spent much of my journalistic careerinvestigating allegations of human traffickingmade against him.I noticed he was currently livestreaming to his followers. I opened up his live stream and, for the first time, bore witness to the insane volatility of the memecoin market.In the space of 10 minutes, dozens of new me-related memecoins were being minted, including “Disgraced News Gatherer”, “Matt Shea is a faggot,” and “Take My Wife Tate (CUCK),” the latter of which included a picture of my fiancee taken from Instagram. Tate was pumping some of these memecoins in value merely by talking about them, with market fluctuations happening in real time on the order of millions, based on his every word.Two seconds after he said the words “Fuck Matt Shea,” a coin called “FUCK MATT SHAE [sic]” soared in value. Twenty minutes later, he uttered the words “Fuck Matt Shea … ” again and it went even higher, only to drop back down to nothing when he finished his sentence with “… is not a generational asset”. He then said he would pump the coin after taking a piss. He walked offscreen to urinate. It rocketed.View image in fullscreenA memecoin inspired by the writer, Matt Shea, as it was listed on one exchange.Photograph: Matt SheaSoon, there were hundreds more Matt Shea memecoins with similar names, as his followers tried to trick people into thinking thattheirMatt Shea memecoin was the one Tate was pumping. His words became memecoins, those memecoins shot up in value, and then the value disappeared instantaneously.All in all, about $2m was spent by people on memecoins making fun of me in the span of a few hours, and hundreds of millions more on other coins he mentioned during the stream.By the end of his live stream, the value of all the coins he pumped was back to near zero. All the fans who had invested at his behest collectively would have lost hundreds of millions of dollars.His followers may have felt they were in on the joke, but in the end they mostly lost their money. Only a tiny number of wallets actually profited from the coin including onecryptothat made a profit of $240,000.‘Roadmap for corruption’: Trump dive into cryptocurrency raises ethics alarmRead moreA number of online crypto investigators includingCoffeezilla,bored2boar,StarPlatinumand others have found that Tate has manipulated memecoin markets using “pump and dump”-like schemes, leading to large profits for those within his inner circle. We put the allegations in these investigations to Tate’s team, who said they had no comment.What happened on Tate’s stream that day felt bizarre but I didn’t completely understand what I was witnessing. I thought I basically understood bitcoin, but how do memecoins differ, and why do they continue to be popular when so many people have lost money on them?Is every memecoin a scam?According to David Gerard, the author of Attack of the 50 Foot Blockchain: “Basically, literally, yes.”“All of this is like a big game of pretend with made-up financial instruments,” he said. “It’s printing your own made-up money. You print your own Monopoly money and then people buy it from you for real money.”The best thing you could possibly say about memecoins is that they initially felt like a funny, countercultural way to participate in internet culture. They satirised a financial system that increasingly looked like a silly game to those on the outside. They encapsulated a humorous generational nihilism.All crypto is bullshit, but memecoins are consciously bullshitAccording to Sander Lutz, the nation’s first crypto-focused White House correspondent: “You could consider a memecoin to be a stock in a cultural phenomenon – like Dogecoin and the Doge meme.”“Another way of defining a memecoin,” Lutz said, “is a cryptocurrency token that has an acknowledged inherent lack of value. The crypto world, outside of memecoins, is full of so many people who are trying to pitch you on tokens that are ‘actually really profound’ or ‘represent a stake’ in some kind of ‘useful network’, but are equally worthless. What makes memecoins different is that there’s none of that noise.”In other words, all crypto is bullshit, but memecoins are consciously bullshit.In their essence, memecoins distill the attention economy into a tradable asset, monetising the ebb and flow of viral internet hype. This has created a system in which the biggest attention-seekers on the planet – Logan Paul, Andrew Tate,Elon Musk,Donald Trump– can bleed their followers for profit. The more controversial they are, the more viral they are; and the more viral they are, the more their memecoins increase in value. Last year, some developers performed attention-seeking stunts on livestreams to pump their tokens, leading toanimal abuse and a faked suicide.Chase Herro, the co-founder of Trump’s main crypto venture, World Liberty Financial, said about crypto: “You can literally sell shit in a can, wrapped in piss, covered in human skin, for a billion dollars if the story’s right, because people will buy it.”Most memecoins end up making money for the person who makes them as a “rug pull” or a “pump and dump”. The term “rug pull” was actually invented by the crypto community, and it works like this:First, you mint a memecoin, and make sure that you and your mates own most of the liquidity pool (the total number of coins in circulation). The size of the liquidity pool – the amount of that memecoin that “exists” – is, like everything else in memecoins, a totally made-up number.Second, you generate hype around the coin by convincing people it will “moon” (shoot up in value). This usually involves getting a celebrity, influencer or the president of the US, to promote it. People then buy the coin, thinking it will be a good investment. Law of demand means that as people buy it, the “value” of the coin goes up, and since you and your mates own the lion’s share, you get richer.The only way you get money is by other people losing moneyDavid GerardThen, at a time known only to you, the creator of the coin, and other insiders, you “pull the rug”, selling off all your stock at the newly high price. You make money, and the value of the coins bought by the masses you manipulated shoots back down to zero. It’s basically a way to just trick people into giving you money, dressed up as an “investment”.A “pump and dump” is pretty much the same thing, but with the slight caveat that you’re doing it with a coin that already exists, rather than creating your own. You buy a cheap coin, “pump” its value by hyping it so others invest, then “dump” all your stock, selling it off at a huge profit and causing everyone else to lose their money.“It’s provably negative sum,” Gerard told me. “The only way you get money is by other people losing money.”The only people really getting rich off memecoins are influencers and their crypto enablers (people like Herro, or Hayden Davis, the guy who helped launch Argentinian president Javier Milei’s memecoin and was involved in Melania Trump’s memecoin).View image in fullscreenDogecoin, the best-known memecoin. The only people getting rich off such crypto are influencers and their enablers.Photograph: Dado Ruvić/ReutersDespite this, the idea that trading memecoins is a good way to get rich persists on the internet. Is it theoretically possible for someone like you or me to invest at just the right time and get rich off a coin?Just as with traditional gambling, there are a tiny number of success stories, such as people like the “Moo Deng whale”, who turned$800of Moo Deng coin (a memecoin referencing theviral pygmy hippoof the same name), into $10m.But only 0.4% ofPump.fun (the main memecoin trading platform)traders have made more than $10,000. About 0.002% have made more than $1m.Lutz told me: “There are a select number of people who’ve made quite a lot of money on these tokens, but they tend to be the same people. They tend to be people who are very well-connected, who are in specific group chats, and who have a lot of existing capital.”“You’ll always have more people losing than amounts of winners,” according to Gerard. “And the winners never shut up, so you think it’s a winning environment.”One of the main reasons people keep falling for these coins is that they think they’ve figured out the scam and invested early, before the rug pull or the dump. But this is never really the case.According to Gerard: “Crypto has been an ever-escalating series of get-rich-quick schemes, where a whole bunch of people think that they’re smarter operators than the previous operator, and generally they’re not.”Memecoin traders will often be invited to Discord and Telegram chats that are sold as “insider channels” where, according to Gerard, “they think they’ll hear about these scams before the rug is pulled – but actually they’re the suckers. Crypto is full of people who think they’re the scammer, not the sucker.”Young gullible menDespite all this, many people – especially young men – continue to invest in memecoins.Forty-two percent of men and 17% of women aged 18 to 29 have invested in, traded or used crypto, according to a 2024Pew Research Center study, compared to only 11% of men and 5% of women over 50.“It’s no accident that memecoins are such a phenomenon among young people who have grown immensely frustrated with a financial system that, I think it’s fair to say, has failed them,” Lutz explained, “and where supposedly sure investments aren’t likely to give them returns that would give them the quality of life their parents had. Memecoins are nakedly meaningless, but there are many financial products, both in crypto and in the world of traditional finance, that may profess to have meaning, but at their core may be nearly as meaningless to young people.”This, too, is why memecoins have become popular with far-right,manosphereinfluencers and their fans.There’s no existing infrastructure to aid people who lose all of their savings on memecoinsSander Lutz“It’s undeniable,” Lutz said, “that the trend in memecoin popularity among younger people – in particular young men – is part of the same trend where you’re seeing a loss of trust in institutions and a loss of confidence that traditional paths to success work out.”“These are the same tenets that have brought young men into the fold of the Maga-verse or to influencers likeAndrew Tate. There’s overlap between them because they both stem from the same frustrations affecting so many young people, in particular young men, who feel more anger, bitterness, disillusionment and nihilism than a generation ago.”Some people don’t even seem to care that they’re being scammed, according to Lutz. “It’s remarkable to see the culture in these ecosystems, because someone will rug-pull a project – what you would consider to be a scam in that they’re running you out of the money – but that’s kind of an accepted practice and people are like: ‘Hey, good for them, I got screwed over, on to the next one.’”“There are too many cases to count of people who’ve lost their entire savings gambling on new coins. If you’re a gambler at a casino, there’s Gamblers Anonymous and an existing infrastructure to deal with people who are addicted to gambling. At casinos you have ‘no play’ lists in compliance with existing laws. There’s no existing infrastructure to aid people who lose all of their savings on memecoins.”Some memecoins try to claim that they’re more than just high-stakes gambling, in order to ensnare more willing buyers. These coins are often accompanied by the false promise of some kind of utility, be it “roadmaps”, “airdrops” ( free tokens given out for marketing purposes), off-chain value mechanisms, games where you can “spend” the coins, and various incomprehensible frameworks using the coin to vote or create some sort of ecosystem. The utility almost never materialises. $Batman coin promised to integrate “entertainment, gaming, and real-world utility”. Paul’s $ZooToken supposedly allowed buyers to play a Pokemon-like gamethat never worked.The exception, the one memecoin to offer a tangible benefit in the real world, is the one sold by the president.President MemeOn 17 January, three days before his second inauguration, Trump launched his own memecoin, $Trump. At the time of writing, the coin’s market cap is over $2.5bn, spurred on by Trump offering a dinner and White House tour to the top owners of the coin, which took place last weekend.Unlike other memecoins, it offered something concrete: access to the president. This made its value soar.View image in fullscreenA protest at Trump National golf club in Sterling, Virginia.Photograph: Rod Lamkey/APRight now, only 20% of the token’s total “supply” is currently in circulation. The remaining 80% is supposedly held by Trump and his business partners.Trump and his business partners are supposedly only allowed to sell off their holdings in $Trump when they are “unlocked” in tranches over time, according to their own made-up rules. As Gerard puts it: “They own the fake money, but they can’t sell it until it’s unlocked in tranches. Note that the limits are artificial. I mean, they could just ‘print’ more.”But already, “58 wallets have made over $10m each from President Donald Trump’s meme coin, totaling $1.1bn in profits”, while “764,000 wallets of mostly small holders have lost money on $TRUMP”, according toCNBC.Gerard said: “A lot of his own fans bought the coin. They thought it would be a fabulous success because Trump is a ‘business genius’. He ripped off his own fans.“The coins’ creators and original sponsors get free $Trump coins and they can dump those on the market at will every time a tranche is released. And they do. And are people ever going to make money on those $Trump coins they bought? Probably not. The money goes to the Trump family, and that’s the direction it was created to make it go in. So yeah, it’s a memecoin dump. He’s just dumping the coins on the suckers and it’s a textbook case.”Trump and his business partners also profit in transaction fees every time $Trump is traded,so far earning $100m.Whether this is all legal or not is up for debate, but soon after launching his own memecoin, Trump replaced the head of the regulator responsible for memecoins, the SEC, with a pro-crypto appointee.It is absolutely the government’s job to stop mis-selling of investmentsDavid GerardLutz said: “In the last few months, the SEC has either dismissed or withdrawn all of its crypto-related lawsuits against every big crypto company in the United States and closed all of its investigations. I mean, the SEC is hosting roundtables almost every week with crypto companies, asking how it can be more helpful to the industry.”Trump has also enthusiastically supported a legal framework for stablecoins. Stablecoins are theoretically stabilised in value by being “pegged” to the value of another asset like the US dollar, but in reality have often become “de-pegged” and therefore unstable.Right now, the Stable Bill and the Genius Bill, which reference Trump calling himself a “stable genius” in 2018, are trying to make their way through Congress. They pave the way for the US government to use stablecoins to pay everything fromhousing grants to social security payments. And Trump himself just so happens to have a stablecoin of his own – through the World Liberty Financial company – which would shoot up in value if these bills pass, earning his family trust potential billions.The Trump family has a claim on 75% of net revenues from World Liberty’s token sales.“It is absolutely the government’s job to stop mis-selling of investments – that’s why ordinary retail mums and dads cannot buy into binary options,” Gerard said. “It’s absolutely open slather for crypto in the US now. This is really bad. A lot of people are going to get skinned. It’s going to be terrible.”The advice? Stay awayIs there any cause for hope? According to Gerard, while it may appear everyone is investing in memecoins, this is mainly exaggerated by the media. Sure, lots of young people have dabbled, but only the real crypto geeks are actually buying the things.From Dogecoin to $Trump: everything you need know about the wild world of meme coinsRead more“The good news is most people are not falling for it. And our evidence for this is the retail dollar trading volumes at Coinbase, the largest crypto dollar exchange. Coinbase happens to be a public company so that means they have to give accurate numbers to the SEC. So they disclosed their retail trading volumes. They’re down 17% in the first quarter of 2025 from where they were in December 2024. They’ve gone down with the Trump coin regime. That gives hope.”As far as my own memecoins go, even the Tate fans who invested appear to have become aware of the scam they fell for.Shortly after the stream went dead, I received an email from a Tate follower titled: “MATT SHAE WE NEED YOUR HELP.” He, along with other Tate fans, claimed they were victims of Tate rug-pulling them. They wanted me to help spread awareness of their community’s plight – by publicizing a new memecoin they had minted called $RRT (Real Rugger Tate).I didn’t write back.Explore more on these topicsCryptocurrenciesDonald TrumpTrump administrationUS politicsAndrew TatefeaturesShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.I’ve found it a delight to write this list of 50 summer wardrobe updates for men, as browsing for menswear is one of my favourite pastimes. I love keeping up to date with what’s trending and finding ways to recreate it on a budget. I’m always looking for under-the-radar independent brands and trawling the secondhand market for a bargain. And not just for myself – I regularly receive messages from friends and family asking for help choosing a birthday gift or deciding what to wear to a specific event, and (nearly) always happily oblige.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.It’s what I do professionally, too. As a stylist and menswear writer with years of experience in helping guys dress their best, I spend a great deal of time looking at clothes online. I know which high-street retailer sells the best jeans; I know where to find good tailoring; what’s worth buying vintage; where to go for high-quality T-shirts; and the brands to shop for the best trainers.So naturally when this commission dropped in my inbox, I gladly accepted. You’ll notice I’ve included quite a bit of butter yellow. It’s thecolour of the season(rememberTimothée Chalamet’s Givenchy suitat this year’s Academy Awards?) There’s a breezy linen shirt you could wear with black trousers and some retro sports shorts that would pair well with a simple T. I’ve also covered this year’s swimwear of choice, as well as some summer season accoutrements – such as sunglasses and jewellery – and everything in between.My top tip? When you’re scrolling through the list, go for pieces that don’t feel like a departure from your personal style. Sure, it’s always good to push yourself to try new things, but you want to feel like the new things you buy merge with your current wardrobe – that way, they’re much less likely to end up at the charity shop in a matter of months.I’ve also listed some inexpensive hacks to help keep your clothes looking their best and lasting longer, as well as a handful of grooming tips that can make a big difference with minimal effort required.The best part? Everything costs £100 or less. You, and your summer wardrobe, can thank me later.1Buy a vintage silk tieFrom spring/summer 2025 fashion shows to TikTok, neckties have made a comeback. Wear with a full suit for a wedding, or a shirt and jeans for a preppy smart-casual look. If you search secondhand, you can get designer options made with luxurious silks for a fraction of the price.View image in fullscreenGiorgio Armani tie£35 at RokitChristian Dior tie£40 at RokitYves Saint Laurent tie£45 at Rokit2Invest in a checked shirtEven though checks are in the spotlight this season – everyone from Burberry to Fendi offered their own take – it’s a timeless pattern that you can wear over and over. The easiest way to opt in is with a shirt.

Bad Bunny (above).Barry Keoghan. The slight crop and squarer shape will give your outfit stronger proportions than a regular fit, making it feel more elevated and considered. You could opt for a shirt, a sweatshirt, a jacket or a knit – but if you’re trying it for the first time, maybe a T-shirt is the easiest way to go.View image in fullscreenBoxy heavyweight terry sweatshirt£39 at Weekday£39 at H&MView image in fullscreenS/S Catalogue T-shirt£50 at Carhartt WIP£40 at John Lewis4New balls, pleaseTennis is becoming more menswear-adjacent every year. From the top players signing deals with big brands – see Jack Draper and Burberry, Jannik Sinner and Gucci, and Carlos Alcarazand Louis Vuitton – to high-street labels offering collections inspired by the sport, it’s turning into a firm fashion favourite.It’s also the perfect blend of two of this year’s biggest trends, preppy and sporty. You want to look as though you’ve played tennis in the morning, then thrown on some casual wear to go for lunch. Avoid anyactualsportswear and instead go for sporty-inspired classics, such as a V-neck sweater over a polo or shorts with a collegiate sweater.For inspiration, take a look atMango’s Tennis Club range: it’s full of well-priced and wearable tennis-inspired pieces.View image in fullscreenPolo shirt£49.99 at Mango5Retro sports shortsAnd tennis isn’t the only sport making its way into this season’s collections. From tracksuits to football jerseys paired with tailoring, sport references are everywhere. One easy way to add sporty energy is with retro shorts. My favourites are from vintage stores, but it does take some digging. If you want a quick fix, Urban Outfitters has a good few options to choose from. Pair them with a louche shirt for a Call Me By Your Name-coded look.View image in fullscreenUmbrofootball shorts£36 at Urban Outfitters£36 at Umbro6Opt for a crew neck cardiThe crew neck cardi has been a womenswear staple for a while, and it’s now made its way to the men’s knitwear section, worn by everyone from Paul Mescal to Troye Sivan. The silhouette is a touch classier than your standard low-V button-up, and since most of us wear a round neck most often (myself included), a crew neck feels much more wearable. Those that look most luxurious have a loose hem, superior softness and a slightly cropped fit for an easy, relaxed finish.View image in fullscreenKnitted crew neck cardigan£36 at Asos7Spread some butter yellow loveView image in fullscreenTimothée Chalamet in butter yellow at the 2025 Oscars in Hollywood.Photograph: JC Olivera/WWD/Getty ImagesButter yellow is the shade of the season, and you’ll find it everywhere from Zara to Asos to Massimo Dutti. It works well with most classic shades, such as black, blue denim and dark brown, so it’s easier to wear than you might think, and will brighten up your colour palette this summer.View image in fullscreenStriped textured shirt£45.99 at Zara8Printed T-shirtsEver sinceLoewe recreated JFK Jr’s “I Told Ya” T-shirtfor Luca Guadagnino’s movie Challengers, printed designs have been rising in popularity. Couverture & The Garbstore always has a good selection from independent brands,and Uniqlo regularly collaborates with the estates of big artists such as Henri Matisse, Pablo Picasso and Jean-Michel Basquiat to produce painterly T-shirts that hit way above their accessible price point.View image in fullscreenTDR Rat T-shirt£50 at Couverture & The GarbstoreView image in fullscreenHenri Matisse UTgraphic T-shirt£19.90 at Uniqlo9Not a patch on appliqueApplique has always been a great way to personalise your clothes, and it’s trending this season (seen at Kenzo and KidSuper), so it’s a great opportunity to get crafty. Vintage patches are the best way to go – anything too new can look a little tacky – and it’s always best to have a vision before you start. If you need some inspo, take a look atBode’s Scouts-inspired jacketsas a starting point.View image in fullscreenMiscellaneous vintage patches£23.30 for 10 at Etsy10Freshen up your sock drawerView image in fullscreenAlexander Skarsgård kicks off shorts-and-calf-length-socks season on Lorraine in May.Photograph: Ken McKay/ITV/ShutterstockIt’s official: Alexander Skarsgård’s recent appearance on Lorraine has launched the start of shorts-and-calf-length-socks season. His socks were by young London designer SSDaley, who’s also a favourite of Harry Styles, but you can get a pretty good match at Moss, the star of smart casual menswear on the high street, and responsibly minded brand Asket. Always go for plain colours and novelty is to be avoided, no matter how funny the joke.View image in fullscreenMerinosocks£40 for three pairs at AsketView image in fullscreenOff-white fine ribbed socks£8.95 a pair at Moss11Boxer shorts as actual shortsView image in fullscreenPaul Mescal appears to wear underwear as outerwear.Photograph: Daniele Venturelli/Getty Images for GucciAs anyone who keeps a close eye on Paul Mescal will know,shorts are gettingevenshorter – he actually wore what looked like oversized cotton boxer shorts to attend Gucci’s spring/summer 2025 show. Ever since, brands including American Vintage andAxel Arigatohave jumped on the underwear-as-outerwear look.Rather than buying the designer versions, though, you could buy a multipack from a high-street store known for good basics (such as the John Lewis ones here, orGap,UniqloorMarks & Spencer), and you’ll essentially get three pairs for the price of one.I’d suggest sizing up for a roomier fit – and don’t forget to wear your underwear beneath to avoid any embarrassing mishaps.View image in fullscreenSeersucker stripe boxers£28 for three at John Lewis12The perfect white T-shirtEveryone should own a well-fitting crisp white T-shirt, particularly when the warmer months hit. While it’s impossible for the same style to work for everyone, there are a few brands known for having the best to offer – namely Merz b Schwanen, the creator of Jeremy Allen White’s T-shirt in The Bear; Sunspel, the heritage label known for luxury basics; andUniqlofor great affordable alternatives.View image in fullscreen2M15 vintage machine jerseyT-shirt€64.80 (about £55) at Merz b SchwanenView image in fullscreenRiviera midweight T-shirt£90 at SunspelView image in fullscreenCrew neckT-shirt£14.90 at Uniqlo13Layer up with a knitDon’t forget warm layers, particularly for cooler summer evenings.A super-soft cashmere or merino wool knit can be thrown over your shoulders, the arms tied in a loose knot.

Boss’s signature trunks launched earlier this year in a campaign fronted by David Beckham. If they’re good enough for Becks, they’re good enough for us. Or if you’d rather keep it low-key with a similar unbranded option, H&M’s your best bet.View image in fullscreenStretch-cotton trunks with logo waistbands£45 for three at Hugo BossView image in fullscreenCotton short trunks£19.99 for five at H&M15Choose an elevated Henley shirtWhether you’ve seen them on influencers or the racks at high-street stores, you might have noticed that Henley shirts are blowing up this summer. If you’re not yet familiar, it’s a crew neck top that originated in Henley-on-Thames as a training staple for rowers during the Royal Regatta. It’s characterised by an elevated three-button placket, and more often than not, it comes ribbed. Cos’s navy design would look great with anything from denim to bermuda shorts.View image in fullscreenRibbed Henley T-shirt£35 at Cos£35 at H&M16Jeans are best done classicJeans shapes fluctuate from season to season, from the indie sleaze skinny leg that reigned supreme during the late noughties, to the boot-cut that took off as part of last year’s western revival and the relaxed wide leg that’s big right now.

It’s breathable, it deals with excess moisture, and it’s antibacterial, meaning it controls body odour. It will even look good without being ironed or steamed (as long as it’s nottoocrumpled).It’s usually best to size up for an expensive-looking finish, and always go for a pure linen.

The silhouette – a slightly cropped, zipped jacket with a cuffed hem and button-up neck strap at the collar –originated from the Mancunian brand Baracuta. It was designed to be lightweight outerwear for golfers that doesn’t limit movement but still protects from inclement weather.It may have made its way off the golf course and into the wardrobes of everyone from James Dean to the Gallagher brothers, but it’s still useful for exactly the same reasons – a light top layer that can deal with the unpredictable British forecast. With Britpop-core on the rise, there’s no better time to invest.View image in fullscreenBacker Harringtonjacket£100 at Levi’sFrom £70.32 at Amazon20Louche, tailored trousersView image in fullscreenA$AP Rocky on the red carpet at this year’s Cannes film festival.Photograph: Kristy Sparow/Getty ImagesFlowy tailored trousers were the hot topic at 2025’s Cannes film festival – see Austin Butler, A$AP Rocky, Paul Mescal et al.

They’re comfortable, breathable and flowy, and the pleats and soft fabric make them look and feel expensive.The brand also offers alterations online or in store.View image in fullscreenPleated wide trousers£39.90 at Uniqlo21Stylish sleepwear setThis year, luxury sleepwear has taken to the skies. If you fly first-class long haul with some of the top airlines, you’ll be treated to a pair of designer PJs – Jacquemus for Air France, Giorgio Armani for Etihad and Tekla for Lufthansa. While us mere mortals can but dream, you could invest in your own stylish pyjama set that’s acceptable to change into after you take off. David Gandy Wellwear’s ultra-soft cotton modal, enriched with an aloe vera treatment that nourishes the skin, will keep you comfy for the long haul – whether you’re flying or not.View image in fullscreenHenley short set£100 at David Gandy Wellwear22Double-breasted suitWedding season is now in full force, so you may be hoping to update your suit rack. This year’s all about double-breasted – and seeing as it’s a cut that’s been around since the early 1900s, we’re sure you’ll be able to wear it for years to come.If you have a few events coming up where you’ll need tailoring, don’t worry about buying multiple suits: just switch up the accoutrements – shirt, tie, socks and so on. Once this year’s nuptials are over, you can wear the jacket or trousers as separates, too.View image in fullscreenDouble-breasted suit£90 at Asos23The plain poloFashion’s obsession with the Gallagher brothers and all things Britpop has returned for 2025 – most likely thanks toOasis’s reunion tour happening later this year. Whatever the reason, it seems polo shirts, a key part of the Britpop uniform, are back in a big way. I’d recommend sticking to the brands best known for their signature polo shirts, such as Lacoste, Fred Perry, Tommy Hilfiger and Ralph Lauren, and go for the classics.View image in fullscreenL1212 polo shirt£61.75 at Debenhams£78 at Frasers24Lesser-known retro trainersIf you’re experiencing Adidas Samba fatigue, it could be time to update your sneaker collection with a pair that’s not so overfamiliar. Enter: Gola’s signature silhouette, the Harrier. It ticks all of the same boxes – comfy, retro-inspired and versatile – and for a great price. But let’s keep it as our little secret.View image in fullscreenHarriertrainers£68 at John Lewis£85 at Debenhams25Gladiator-inspired sandalsGladiator sandals are, quite literally, ancient history. Though they date back quite some time, they’re most recently associated with the boho It Girls of the noughties, such as Sienna Miller and Kate Moss. This time, it’s men slipping into the strappy soles instead.Don’t worry – we’re not suggesting you go for those with knee-high ties like the socialites of the early aughts. The menswear take is tougher and sleeker. Most are a slip-on construction with thicker leather straps and a proper base – if you’d rather go for an ankle strap, try to keep it minimal and understated. Schuh has just the pair.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe FilterFree weekly newsletterGet the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

There’s even an ongoingTikTok trendabout how much hotter men look while wearing caps (especially backwards, apparently). Just make sure you avoid the Maga slogan at all costs.The best baseball cap in 2025, in my opinion, is one with understated embroidery or applique detailing, an unstructured front section – which usually comes with six panels – and a curved peak. Scrt has a unique offering that’s inspired by cult classic pop culture from La Haine to the Streets.View image in fullscreenOriginal Pirate Material dad cap£45 at Scrt29Wear a sterling silver chainA silver chain is the perfect finishing touch to an unbuttoned collar – and silver offsets a light summer tan nicely (don’t forget your SPF, though). In this era of financial uncertainty, the unfussy, cheaper alternative to gold is rising in popularity. You can get solid sterling silver for a great price, so try to avoid anything made using brass as it will tarnish and leave green traces on your skin. My favourite?

There are three main factors to look out for: a substantial fabric, a structured bottom, and a handle that easily goes over your shoulder.

One who doesn’t? Patrick Schwarzenegger. At this year’s Met Gala, he proved his expertise in the belt department by making an oxblood design the centrepiece of his Balmain look. We’re not suggesting a bold red leather strap would work for everyone, but it proves just how much a good belt can do.For more wearability, stick to those made from premium leather with decent buckles – nothing too slight or delicate – and you’ll be on the right track. I’d suggest starting with black, which goes with everything. If you’re set on brown, though, keep light toffee tones at arm’s length and instead go for deep, rich hues like chocolate and mocha.View image in fullscreenLeatherbelt£85 at Mr Porter33Try a braceletView image in fullscreenNo, really. Since your wrists tend to be more on show while it’s warm, it’s the best time of year to wear bracelets. An oft-overlooked accessory for men, it’s an added touch that says you’ve made an effort.

Elastic bands are a useful wardrobe tool during summer – especially if you like wearing shirts. They allow you to roll up your sleeves and secure them in place throughout the day.

What would that look like?Ben ChildIf the franchise were to embrace a darker side, could we expect geysers of blood as in the samurai films that inspired George Lucas? Or does Reynolds just want a sweary, snarky Star Wars like Deadpool?Fri 30 May 2025 07.06 EDTLast modified on Fri 30 May 2025 07.22 EDTShareTake all the essential ingredients of Star Wars – samurais in space, adventure among the wookiees, aliens with backward syntax, evil cyborgs with a penchant for murder by telekinesis – then imagine George Lucas hadn’t given us all of that through a PG prism. This, it appears, is whatRyan Reynolds didwhen pitching to Disney. “I said, ‘Why don’t we do an R-rated Star Wars property?’” Reynolds told The Box Office podcast. “‘It doesn’t have to be overt, A+ characters. There’s a wide range of characters you could use.’ And I don’t mean R-rated to be vulgar. R-rated as a Trojan horse for emotion. I always wonder why studios don’t want to just gamble on something like that.”Let’s imagine the scene: a gaggle of studio execs are nervously cowering before the Hollywood A-lister’s megawatt smirk as he reveals his idea for a take on George Lucas’s space opera that doesn’t hold back. This isStar WarsTarantino-style. Perhaps Mando’s got a drug problem, or Chewie really does rip people’s arms off – and beat them to death with the wet ends. Somewhere over in Coruscant a Jedi slices a corrupt senator into symmetrical chunks without ever unsheathing his saber. Or maybe Reynolds just thinks the galaxy far, far away could use a little more Deadpool & Wolverine-style sweary irreverence.He’s wrong. Push Star Wars too far into the realm of self-aware snark, or nudge it to start laughing at itself before the audience does, and you undercut the very thing that keeps fans tethered to its dusty, big-hearted mythos. We already have umpteen animated takedowns –Robot Chicken’s fever-dream dismemberments, Family Guy’s fart-laced remakes – and they’re fine, in their way. But if Star Wars ever starts mimicking the shows that exist solely to mock it, then the circle will be complete.View image in fullscreenThe TV series Andor already gives us Star Wars without the fairytale sheen.Photograph: TCD/AlamyHaving said that, it’s impossible to dismiss completely the idea of a darker, more adult take, because all the essential ingredients are already in place. There are very few kids’ movies in which a father cuts off his own child’s limbs, or a giant slug-monster chains a bikini-clad hostage to its throne. There are not many movies fit for a Saturday matinee that feature swamp goblins gaslighting traumatised orphans. From despair-fuelled redemption arcs to slow-burn patricide, Star Wars already has everything it needs to drop the family-friendly facade and lean fully into its dark side.The original Star Wars is back – but what if George Lucas is right about it not being much good?Read moreAndor, and to a lesser extentRogue One, have already shown that it’s possible to dispense with the fairytale veneer. Perhaps what Reynolds is saying is that if superhero movies can prosper by dismantling their own mythology in a blaze of sweary sarcasm, why shouldn’t space-opera flicks find similar salvation in a galaxy whereblood spurts with wild abandonlike the Kurosawan epics that Lucas borrowed so much from in the first place.Perhaps it’s a terrible idea and would ruin everything that feels sacred about Star Wars. But just for a moment imagine it: a galaxy not full of hope but hangovers. Where Force ghosts don’t offer guidance, they just hover awkwardly, muttering regrets. Where Chewbacca’s fur is matted with something unspeakable and the lightsabers don’t hum, they scream.Explore more on these topicsStar WarsWeek in geekRyan ReynoldsAndorAction and adventure filmsScience fiction and fantasy filmsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Instead, it will reiterate a commitment made by Starmer in February to increase thedefence budgetto 2.5% of GDP by 2027 and to 3% in the next parliament.But it is likely to be used to help justify a significant expansion in medium-term defence spending that is expected to be agreed at the Nato summit later in June that could amount to more than £50bn in real terms.Members of the western alliance are discussing a proposal to increase core defence spending to 3.5% of GDP by 2032, with a further 1.5% for cyber and infrastructure initiatives, in response to pressure from Donald Trump.This week Mark Rutte, Nato’s secretary general, said he expected the June summit in The Hague would see allies agree on “a high defence spend target” of 5% in total, including a figure “considerably north of 3%” on pure defence spending.The review is also expected to refer to the question of the size of the British army, amid reports that theMinistry of Defenceand Treasury have been battling over whether to include a commitment to increase numbers from the target of 73,000.Figures out this week show that the size of the army has dropped below the target to the lowest level since the Napoleonic era and earlier, with the number of full-time trained soldiers at 70,860 on 1 April, down 2.3% over the preceding year.A military source said the defence secretary, John Healey, a persistent critic of falling army size in opposition, had won a commitment to increase the army by a few thousand, but the Ministry of Defence said it did not recognise the speculation.A commitment to increase army numbers by 5,000, if the recruitment can be achieved, would cost about £2.5bn a year in extra pay, accommodation, kit and other resources. But if successful, it would help the military be able to meet what are likely to be growing overseas commitments in the years ahead.Britain and France have agreed to lead a multinational “reassurance force” of up to 30,000 to help keep the peace in Ukraine and keep its air and seaports open if Russia signs up to a durable ceasefire, though so far Vladimir Putin has been unwilling to do so, despite pleas from Trump to stop the war.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Iran has emerged as a supplier of drones to Russia while China provides components for weapons – and North Korea has sent troops to fight against Ukraine.Starmer is expected to unveil the outline review at an event on Monday before Healey lays the full document before parliament.Explore more on these topicsDefence policyMinistry of DefenceMilitarynewsShareReuse this content"

The bodies of two others were buried beneath the rubble.A few miles away, 11-year-old Yaqeen Hammad, known asGaza’s youngest social media influencer, was killed after a series of heavy Israeli airstrikes hit the house where she lived with her family. She was watering flowers in a tiny patch of greenery eked out of a displacement camp when she died. Her cousin, 16-year-old Eyad, was gravely wounded.Even by the terrible standards of theGazaconflict, the deaths had the power to shock. But they were also a reflection of a daily reality in the territory: the killing and maiming of its youngest citizens and the destruction of a generation.View image in fullscreenAdam al-Najjar lying in a hospital bed at Nasser hospital.Photograph: Hani Alshaer/Anadolu/Getty ImagesView image in fullscreenA family photograph of Adam al-Najjar (left), with two of his siblings, Sedra and Eve, who were killed.Photograph: ReutersAccording to local health officials, whose estimates have generally been found to be accurate by the global humanitarian community, more than 16,500 children have been killed in the 19 months since the war began – a figure almost 24 times higher than the number ofchildren killed in Ukraine, where the population is 20 times bigger, since Russia’s invasion. The World Health Organization tally for child deaths stands at 15,613.Graph showing number of people killed by age and genderColleagues of Najjar say that in the days since she lost her children she has spent her waking hours weeping outside a room in Nasser hospital. Inside lies her only surviving child, 11-year-old Adam, who is clinging to life with the help of a ventilator, his breathing shallow and more than 60% of his body covered in burns.Najjar’s husband, Hamdi, a 40-year-old physician, also survived the strike but suffered severe injuries, including brain damage and fractures caused by shrapnel.View image in fullscreenHamdi al-Najjar in the intensive care unit in Nasser hospital.Photograph: Hatem Khaled/ReutersView image in fullscreenAlaa al-Najjar (left) being comforted at Nasser hospital on 25 May.Photograph: Hatem Khaled/ReutersReached by the Guardian, theIsraelDefense Forces (IDF) said “the Khan Younis area is a dangerous war zone” and that “the claim regarding harm to uninvolved civilians is under review”.Speaking to the Italian newspaper La Repubblica, Adam’s uncle, Ali al-Najjar, 50, issued a desperate plea: “Adam must be taken away, to a real hospital, outside Gaza. I beg the Italian government – do something. Take him. Save him, Italians.”On Thursday, Italy’s foreign minister, Antonio Tajani,said the country was ready to receive Adamfor medical care and was working to arrange his evacuation.Along a corridor in the same hospital where Adam is being treated lies Eyad. His father – and Yaqeen’s uncle – is Hussein Hassan, a 46-year-old Red Crescent paramedic. Hassan said he was working in the hospital’s emergency department when he received a call saying his son had been injured and his niece killed by a missile.Hassan said the family had received no warning that a strike was imminent and that he was haunted by the question of why a missile would be fired that hit children watering and planting flowers. “How could this be? The children are still so young to be considered targets,” he said. “Was there a targeted vehicle nearby? Or someone being pursued who passed by the street? I don’t know.”When news of Yaqeen’s death spread online on Monday, there was an outpouring of grief and tributes from activists, followers and journalists. “Yaqeen was cheerful, full of energy,” Hassan said. “Due to my workload I hadn’t seen her in a month before she died – and that’s what hurt the most, that my last sight of her was when she was wrapped in a white shroud.“I said my goodbye to her in the morgue at al-Aqsa Martyrs hospital in Deir-al Balah, and then carried her cold body into the ambulance to be transported for burial. Her family is devastated – she was their pampered youngest, the baby of the family.”0:24Palestinian influencer Yaqeen Hammad gives tips on cooking with no gas – videoEyad remains in intensive care in Nasser hospital. He lost his left eye in the strike and has a fractured shoulder. When he was admitted to hospital, shrapnel was embedded in various parts of his body.“Seeing him in that condition broke my heart – my son, now lying in the hospital before my eyes,” Hassan said. “Yaqeen’s story is like that of so many children in Gaza who have been killed in the war, for no reason. They are not just numbers – each child has a story, a life, and families who are heartbroken by their loss.”The IDF says it is reviewing the circumstances of the strike.Three days later, in Gaza City, another family suffered another unimaginable loss. Six-year-old Ward Khalil’s mother and two of her siblings were among dozens of Palestinians killed in Israeli strikes on Fahmi al-Jarjawi school. Harrowing footage showed Ward leaving the scene of the strike, her body silhouetted against flames that had engulfed the school.0:25Young girl escapes flames after Gaza school strike – videoThe next day Ward gave an interview to Al Jazeera in which she recounted the horrors she had experienced. “When I woke up, I found a huge fire, and I saw my mom was dead,” she said. “I walked in the fire so I could escape … I was in the fire, and the ceiling fell on me.

Of these, 14,100 cases are expected to be severe.According to the UN humanitarian aid organisation for children, Unicef, more than 9,000 children have been treated for malnutrition in Gaza this year. “These children – lives that should never be reduced to numbers – are now part of a long, harrowing list of unimaginable horrors,”Unicef said in a statementthis week.“The children of Gaza need protection,” it said. “They need food, water and medicine. They need a ceasefire. But more than anything, they need immediate, collective action to stop this once and for all.”"

But about 10,000 women under 50 are diagnosed with breast cancer in the UK each year, including 2,400 in their thirties. Breast cancer is the leading cause of death in women aged 35 to 50.Now doctors leading a major study named in memory of the singerSarah Hardingsay all women should undergo a comprehensive risk assessment when they turn 30.Harding, who was part of the pop groupGirls Aloud, died from the disease aged 39 in 2021 and one of herfinal wisheswas to find new ways of spotting breast cancer early, when it is more treatable.The BreastCancerRisk Assessment in Young Women (Bcan-Ray) project, run by the Christie hospital in Manchester where Harding was treated, is the first of its kind in the world to identify which younger women are at increased risk of the disease.Early results from the study show that about one in five women aged between 30 and 39 years old have been identified at increased risk. They are being given information on steps they can take to reduce their odds of developing the disease.They will also be offered yearly check-ups until they reach the age when they are eligible for NHS breast cancer screening at the age of 50.In a statement, Girls Aloud – Cheryl Tweedy, Nadine Coyle, Nicola Roberts and Kimberley Walsh – said Harding would be “thrilled” by the early results from the Bcan-Ray study.“To hear that women who had no idea they could be at risk of breast cancer are being identified and able to take preventative measures is astounding.“This study in Sarah’s name has the potential to be lifesaving and we are hopeful the results will be rolled out across the UK allowing doctors to predict and prevent breast cancer for many women. Sarah was an amazing woman and we couldn’t be more proud of the legacy she has left.”The study, funded by the Christie Charity’s Sarah Harding Breast Cancer Appeal, began in May 2023 and has recruited 719 women from the Greater Manchester and Cheshire area aged 30 to 39.Women who take part are asked to complete a questionnaire, have a risk assessment mammogram and provide a saliva sample for genetic testing.Information from the mammogram and the genetic test are then combined with other factors such as when a woman’s periods started, alcohol consumption and use of the contraceptive pill, to provide a personalised breast cancer risk score.To date, researchers have calculated a risk score for 548, with 104 found to be at “increased risk”.Those at increased risk have consultations to discuss the implication of their increase in risk, including strategies to reduce risk through exercise, diet and medication advice. Early breast screening is offered when the risk hits a certain level, which is at different ages for each woman.The trial is being expanded to other hospitals across the UK as senior NHS officials develop a national cancer plan, which will aim to improve diagnosis and treatment.Extra cancer scans for women with dense breasts could save 700 lives a year – UK studyRead moreThe study is being led by Dr Sacha Howell, who was Harding’s consultant when she was being treated at the Christie. On Saturday, he will chair a panel on prevention, risk reduction and genetics at the world’s largest cancer conference, theAmerican Society of Clinical Oncology’s annual meeting, in Chicago.Speaking before the discussion, Howell said all women should undergo “comprehensive risk assessment” from the age of 30. This would mean DNA tests and health questionnaires as a minimum, with annual mammograms for some.“Breast cancer is the most common cause of death in women aged 35 to 50 in this country and about two-thirds of women who develop breast cancer don’t have a family history of it.”He added: “What we want to do is to try and identify women at increased risk so that we can start screening early and reduce the chances of these women dying.”The definition of “higher risk” means a 3% chance of developing breast cancer in the next 10 years. This is the average risk for a woman aged 50 and over, which is why mammograms are offered routinely then.The Christie project is one of the world’s first research programmes to identify breast cancer risks in younger women without a family history of the disease – mirroring Harding’s own experience. Howell said the singer had spoken to him many times about “wanting to leave a legacy for future women”.Final results are expected o be published next year and fed into the UK national screening committee, after which trials may be rolled out more widely to determine whether all women in their thirties should be offered risk screening.“I would like all women over 30 to have a breast cancer risk assessment,” Howell said. “That doesn’t have to be a mammogram, probably the most powerful part of this is the DNA analysis.”Prof Peter Johnson, the NHS national clinical director for cancer, said: “We are working closely with government on a national cancer plan to ensure the NHS continues to deliver progress in diagnosing more cancers earlier and saving lives, and this research provides valuable information about the potential for more personalised approaches to screening.“If women are worried about any symptoms, whatever their age, or if they notice a change in their bodies or something that’s unusual for them, then I would encourage them to contact their GP.”Explore more on these topicsCancer researchCancerHealthMedical researchnewsShareReuse this content"

The youngest alleged victims are aged 11 and 17.Two charges, wounding and attempted grievous bodily harm, relate to one of the young people. None of the six can be named due to reporting restrictions.Wearing a black suit and grey tie, Doyle spoke only to confirm his name, address and date of birth during the short magistrates court hearing. He looked emotional as he was brought into the packed courtroom, glancing briefly at the dozens of reporters before fixing his gaze to the floor.Astbury said it was alleged that Doyle “used his vehicle as a weapon to injure”. Richard Derby, defending, said there was no indication of his pleas to the charges at this stage.After a 12-minute hearing, Doyle was remanded in custody and told by the district judge, Paul Healey, that he would appear at Liverpool crown court later the same day.Astbury argued Doyle should be refused bail as there was a “real risk to his safety” if he were allowed to leave court. The prosecutor said the defendant “appeared to be a man of some means”, meaning there was a “substantial risk of failing to attend court”.Healey, the district judge, described the case as “truly exceptional” as he imposed reporting restrictions preventing the identification of the six victims. He said the defendant was alleged to have caused “very extensive injuries” and there was a “very real prospect of further charges”.Later on Friday, in a brief hearing at Liverpool crown court before Judge Menary KC, Astbury said: “This is very much an ongoing investigation and there are many witnesses still be interviewed and a great deal of CCTV still to be analysed and, of course, medical evidence to be secured.”Doyle nodded as he was told by Menary that he would be remanded in custody “given the nature of the public interest in this case and the legitimate concerns that others have about your welfare if in the community”. He was told he would next appear at Liverpool crown court on 14 August before a provisional trial date on 24 November.Doyle’s LinkedIn profile says he was a Royal Marine commando between 1990 and 1994 before working in IT and cybersecurity. The university graduate is said to have worked previously for an NHS trust and a large UK wealth management firm.View image in fullscreenA vehicle believed to contain Paul Doyle drives into court on Friday.Photograph: Phil Noble/ReutersThe Crown Prosecution Service said on Thursday it would keep the charges under review “as the investigation progresses”.The assistant chief constable Jenny Sims, of Merseyside police, said the force was “determined to gather as much evidence as possible” and that detectives were analysing volumes of CCTV footage, dashcam material and police body-worn video.Sims said: “I fully understand how this incident has left us all shocked and saddened, and I know many will continue to have concerns and questions. Our detectives are working tirelessly, with diligence and professionalism, to seek the answers to all those questions. When we are able to, we will provide further information.”She added: “We know Monday’s shocking scenes reverberated around the city of Liverpool, and the entire country, on what should have been a day of celebration for hundreds of thousands of Liverpool FC supporters. Our thoughts remain with all those affected.”Explore more on these topicsUK newsnewsShareReuse this content"

Should it go, replacing it will be impossible,” he said.The centre has been locked ina funding disputewith its local authority, North Northamptonshire, in recent years. The council’s previous Tory leadership made no bones aboutits disdainfor Pen Green, cutting its funding from £1m to £300,000 in 2022 despite widespread public opposition.The survival of Pen Green, which is in Corby, an economically deprived post-industrial corner of a mainly affluent county, is being seen as an early test for the council’s Reform leadership, whichtook powerafter May’s local elections.North Northamptonshire’s leader, Martin Griffiths, who was a Tory council leader in neighbouring Wellingborough before switching to Reform, has previously visited the centre and is understood to have been impressed by its services.In a statement, the council paid tribute to Pen Green and said it would “endeavour” to help it: “In relation to the previous Sure Start scheme, it was extremely respected and successful, and crucially it was funded centrally. When this was withdrawn, the initiative ceased.“We would welcome long-term centrally funded initiatives to invest in our children, young people and communities … [our] finances are challenging, and our statutory responsibilities have priority. If theLabourgovernment can provide the finances to run initiatives such as Sure Start then they would be viewed favourably by this council.”Maintained nurseries are funded by Department for Education grants but councils have discretion over how the money is shared. Pen Green argues its problems arose when the previous regime chose to redirect extra funding traditionally earmarked for the centre to other nurseries in the county.The education secretary, Bridget Phillipson, visited Pen Green three years ago. She is also believed to be an admirer of the centre, which was created in the early 1980s in a disused primary school and provides integrated nursery, health, family support and social care services for about 1,000 children under five each year.The centre, which is hugely popular locally, has trained thousands of early years professionals, operates a thriving research centre, and attracts hundreds of visitors a year from all over the world seeking to learn from its approach.Lee Barron, the Labour MP for Corby and East Northamptonshire, said: “Pen Green really is the jewel in the crown as far as children’s centres are concerned. It epitomises Labour values and it is something I will fight to protect.”While No 10 and Phillipson recognise Sure Start’s popularity, especially with Labour voters, she has in the pastdownplayedthe prospects of a return to the programme’s generously funded glory days, saying change “will not come simply from winding back the clock”.A key Labour mission is to ensure all children, especially those from deprived backgrounds, are“school ready”by the time they reach primary age in areas such as language development, social skills and even teeth brushing – ambitions that children’s centres such as Pen Green argue are at the core of the services they provide.Recent research has found thelong-term impacts of Sure Startwere positive and cost-effective, producing better health, education and social care outcomes for families who enrolled in the programme during the 2000s.At its peak in 2009-10 there were 3,600 Sure Start centres in England, before austerity cuts reduced government funding by two-thirds, with local authoritiesscaling back or closing most of the centresby 2018.Explore more on these topicsEarly years educationChildrenNorthamptonshireCuts and closuresReform UKLabourSocial exclusionnewsShareReuse this content"

She was 87.Publicist Harlan Boll says Swit died on Friday at her home inNew YorkCity, likely from natural causes.Swit andAlan Aldawere the longest-serving cast members on M*A*S*H, the series based on Robert Altman’s 1970 film, which was itself based on a novel by Richard Hooker, the pseudonym of H Richard Hornberger.The CBS show aired for 11 years from 1972 to 1983, revolving around life at the 4077th Mobile Army Surgical hospital, which gave the show its name. The two-and-a-half-hour finale on 28 February 1983, lured over 100 million viewers, the most-watched episode of any scripted series ever.View image in fullscreenAlan Alda, Wayne Rogers and Loretta Swit.Photograph: CBS Photo Archive/Getty ImagesRolling Stone magazine put M*A*S*H at No 25 of the best TV shows of all time, while Time Out put it at No 34. It won the Impact Award at the 2009 TV Land annual awards. It won a Peabody Award in 1975 “for the depth of its humor and the manner in which comedy is used to lift the spirit and, as well, to offer a profound statement on the nature of war”.In Altman’s 1970 film, Houlihan was a one-dimensional character – a sex-crazed bimbo who earned the nickname “Hot Lips”. Her intimate moments were broadcast to the entire camp after somebody planted a microphone under her bed.Sally Kellermanplayed Houlihan in the movie version and Swit took it over for TV, eventually deepening and creating her into a much fuller character. The sexual appetite was played down and she wasn’t even called Hot Lips in the later years.M*A*S*H at 50: ‘Everything about it is relevant, today, tomorrow and yesterday’Read moreThe growing awareness of feminism in the 70s spurred Houlihan’s transformation from caricature to real person, but a lot of the change was due to Swit’s influence on the scriptwriters.“Around the second or third year I decided to try to play her as a real person, in an intelligent fashion, even if it meant hurting the jokes,” Swit told Suzy Kalter, the author of The Complete Book of M*A*S*H.“To oversimplify it, I took each traumatic change that happened in her life and kept it. I didn’t go into the next episode as if it were a different character in a different play. She was a character in constant flux; she never stopped developing.”Swit’s other roles included films such as Race with the Devil and SOB and shows including The Love Boat.

All of the music I’ve ever made … now belongs … to me.”She originallylost the rights in 2019when her first record label, Big Machine, sold them to music executive Scooter Braun. Swift described the sale to Braun as her “worst case scenario”, and said she had not been given the opportunity to buy her work outright, but to “earn” one album back for each new album she recorded for the label. Her subsequent albums, from 2019’s Lover onwards, were released on Republic, with Swift retaining the rights to the master recordings.Braun at one time managed Kanye West, who repeatedly targeted Swift after he infamouslyinvaded her acceptance speechat the 2009 VMA awards. In November 2020, Braun sold the master recordings to the private equity firm Shamrock Capital in November for a reported $300m.In a letter to fans posted today, Swift said that she bought her masters – as well as her videos, concert films, album art and photography and unreleased songs – back from Shamrock. The Guardian understands that previous rumours that it cost Swift between $600m and $1bn are inaccurately high.As was customary for record deals at the time, Swift’s arrangement with Big Machine meant that they owned her master recordings, hence she did not own them at the point of sale. In her letter, she wrote: “All I’ve ever wanted was the opportunity to work hard enough to be able to one day purchase my music outright with no strings attached, no partnership, with full autonomy.“I will be forever grateful to everyone at Shamrock Capital for being the first people to ever offer this to me. The way they’ve handled every interaction we’ve had has been honest, fair and respectful. This was a business deal to them, but I really felt like they saw it for what it was to me: my memories and my sweat and my handwriting and my decades of dreams. I am endlessly thankful. My first tattoo might just be a huge shamrock in the middle of my forehead.”Swift credited the support of her fans with enabling her to buy back her music. “I can’t thank you enough for helping to reunite me with this art that I have dedicated my life to, but have never owned until now.”In order to regain control over her catalogue after the original sale to Braun – and to devalue his investment – Swift embarked on a project to rerecord all six albums, branding each one “(Taylor’s Version)” and adding “From the Vault” tracks from the original songwriting sessions that hadn’t made it on to the original albums.Between 2021 and 2023, Swift rerecorded her albumsFearless(originally released in 2008),Red(2012),Speak Now(2010) and1989(2014).As the principal songwriter, she has the right to rerecord the material and to block any use of the original recordings. Several rerecorded songs made their debuts in film and TV syncs: last week, the new version of Look What You Made Me Do – from the as-yet unreleased rerecording of 2017’s Reputation – appeared in the new series of The Handmaid’s Tale.Reputation and Swift’s self-titled debut album, from 2006, are the only albums not to be rerecorded. Fans have been speculating as to their possible release dates for years, leaping on the colours of her outfits and what they perceive to be clues in her limited social media posts to deduce when they would appear.Now that Swift has reacquired her master recordings, there is less reason to proceed with the rerecordings.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSleeve NotesFree weekly newsletterGet music news, bold reviews and unexpected extras.

What about Rep TV?” she wrote, calling the record by its fan nickname. “Full transparency: I haven’t even rerecorded a quarter of it. The Reputation album was so specific to that time in my life, and I kept hitting a stopping point when I tried to remake it.”Reputation – which Swift recently called a “goth-punk moment of female rage at being gaslit by an entire social structure” – was born of a time when her public image had tanked in the wake of a feud with Kanye West and accusations of overexposure.“All that defiance, that longing to be understood while feeling purposely misunderstood, that desperate hope, that shame-born snarl and mischief. To be perfectly honest, it’s the one album in those first six that I thought couldn’t be improved upon by redoing it. Not the music, or photos, or videos. So I kept putting it off.”Swift told fans that they might yet hear the unreleased Reputation From the Vault tracks, “if you’re into the idea”. She confirmed that she had rerecorded her debut. “I really love how it sounds now. Those two albums can still have their moments to re-emerge when the time is right, if that would be something you guys would be excited about. But if it happens, it won’t be from a place of sadness and longing for what I wish I could have. It will just be a celebration now.”One suspects she will release the records, or what exists of them: the essential redundancy of the project is unlikely to thwart its potentially vast commercial impact. The four previously released rerecordings broke commercial and chart records for Swift: in the UK alone, 1989 (Taylor’s Version) clocked higher first-week combined streams and sales – 184,000 – than the original total of 90,000 a decade earlier.Taylor-made deals: how artists are following Swift’s rights exampleRead moreThe rerecordings were interspersed with a run of new, original recordings. Swift has released four albums since 2020: her lockdown sister records Folklore and Evermore (2020), as well as Midnights (2022) andThe Tortured Poets Department(2024).Swift’s monumentally successful catalogue was showcased on her Eras tour, which travelled the world between 2023 and 2024, became the first ever billion dollar-grossing tour, and eventually grossed more than $2bn in total. The show was divided into album-specific segments, andupdated when it hit Europein 2024 to include a new Tortured Poets section.Swift concluded her letter by referencing the industry-wide conversations about artist rights that her saga had kickstarted. These days, it is far more common, particularly for young female artists, to own their masters than it was for the teenage Swift in 2006.“Every time a new artist tells me they negotiated to own their master recordings in their record contract because of this fight, I’m reminded of how important it was for all of this to happen. Thank you for being curious about something that used to be thought of as too industry-centric for broad discussion. You’ll never know how much it means to me that you cared. Every single bit of it counted and ended us up here.”Explore more on these topicsTaylor SwiftPop and rockMusic industrynewsShareReuse this content"

But now the flagship BBC documentary series is itself in the glare of scrutiny.Gerry Adams’victory in a libel caseon Friday dealt a heavy blow toSpotlightand the BBC and raises questions over the programme and the impact of the case on journalism in the UK and Ireland.The broadcaster faces having to pay €100,000 (£84,000) in damages and potentially several million euros in legal costs, as well as challenges over the future of investigative journalism and current affairs in NorthernIreland.Since launching in 1973, Spotlight has won countless scoops and awards. But that hard-won reputation and credibility took a hit when a jury at Dublin’s high court found that a 2016 documentary, and an accompanying online article, libelled theformer Sinn Féin leaderby carrying a false claim that he had sanctioned the murder of an MI5 informant in 2006. The jury found that the BBC had not acted in good faith or in a fair and reasonable way.“It’s a blow for theBBCbut it’s important that Spotlight does continue,” said Jim Fitzpatrick, a former Spotlight reporter. “They’re a talented team that doubtless will have more investigations to come. The journalists and producers will be keen to get on with the next one. You take these hits.”Others were less sanguine and worried that the impact could spread to less well-funded media organisations.“Spotlight is somewhere between well regarded and revered,” said Noel Doran, a former editor of theIrish News. “It is the flagship documentary strand with heavyweight presenters and major stories. They’ve got the resources and can take months or a year or even more to get a story.”For Spotlight to lose such a high-profile,expensive casewas a bad day for journalism, Doran said. “There will be a chilling effect in newsrooms. People will be thinking very carefully about anything to do with Adams. There is a danger that a much more benign view of the Troubles becomes more commonplace.”The trial’s outcome cast a harsh light on Spotlight’s decision to carry the now discredited claim about Adams based on an anonymous source called Martin. The trial heard that the BBC obtained corroboration from five other sources but these were not mentioned in the programme.The verdict also puts into question the decision of Adam Smyth, the director of BBC Northern Ireland, to fight the case rather than settle. Doran said the BBC probably could have avoided an expensive legal showdown. “Almost every case can be settled with a bit of flexibility on all sides.”Doran said the documentary’s sourcing of the disputed claim had left it vulnerable. “Jennifer O’Leary came across as a sincere, committed reporter but the programme came across as dubious.”Some BBC staffers worry that chastened managers may soft-pedal investigations or trim budgets.The documentary was viewed by an estimated 16,000 people in the Republic of Ireland, which allowed Adams to fight the case under Irish libel law and with a jury.Adams denies having been a member of theIRAbut has not taken legal action against longstanding, widespread claims that he was a commander in Belfast and a member of the IRA army council. Spotlight raised the stakes by carrying the claim that he sanctioned a specific murder years after the 1998 Good Friday agreement.Explore more on these topicsGerry AdamsBBCNorthern IrelandIrelandMedia lawanalysisShareReuse this content"

They would sing and shuffle their feet to the beat of the drums in aring shout, aritualto honor the deceased that originated inAfricaand which is still practiced by the descendants of enslaved people in the south-east US today. For the bereaved who grieved the recent death of a loved one, their practice orbited around the setting sun.So begins a chapter about our closest star in Painting the Cosmos, a recent book by UC Santa Cruz astrophysicist Dr Nia Imara. The book blendsscienceand art in an ode to the diversity of the cosmos. While touching onastronomicaltidbits, such as the fact that scientists measure the rate of the sun’s spin by tracking thesunspotson its surface, Imara demonstrates the influence of astronomy on life and culture throughout history. She compares the sun’s rhythmic cycle to the repetition found in the Black artist Alma Thomas’s abstract paintings of space, and the patterns in the west African Bwa people’s multicolored wooden masks depicting the sun and nature. As a painter and one of the only Black female astronomy professors in the US, Imara focuses on the contributions of Black and brown artists and scientists throughout her book.For Imara, it’s important that young Black and brown people also see people in the sciences who look like them. That’s why she created the non-profit Onaketa in 2020 to offer free science, technology, engineering and mathematics (Stem) online tutoring for Black and brown youth throughout the nation, who are mentored by scientists of color.View image in fullscreenDr Nia Imara looking into a telescope at the Chabot Space and Science Center in Oakland, California.Photograph: Courtesy of Dr Nia Imara“Oftentimes when we’re taught science and math in school, the focus in our textbooks and in the classrooms is on the contributions of white folks, and it’s really important to show people that science is a human endeavor,” Imara said. “Astronomy is often considered the oldest science, and certainly people from all over the world have made really valuable contributions.”Diversity is necessary for harmony in the universe, Imara argues in her book. Our solar system consists of eight planets of varying sizes, temperatures and features. “If you change any one of these eight planets, or you didn’t have one of them for some reason, that would have serious implications for the development of life on Earth,” Imara said. Jupiter, the largest planet in our solar system, has a large gravitational influence that deflects meteors that would otherwise hit the Earth’s surface; and if Saturn were any smaller that it currently is, the Earth’s orbit around the sun would change and might no longer hold liquid water.“One of the things that science has taught me is that there are so many metaphors like this in nature,” Imara said. “And if we take them to heart and apply them to ourselves here, I think that would really go a long way in how we treat each other, and how our society works.”‘Where do we fit into the universe?’Imara became interested in astronomy at a young age as she pondered existential questions about human life: “What is the meaning of all this, and where do we fit into the universe?” As a sophomore in high school, she took a physics class that answered some of her fundamental questions.“My relationship to science now has evolved so that I don’t think any more that science can answer all of these big, deep questions, which are often very religious, very philosophical and even moral in nature,” Imara said. “But I appreciate science and nature even more for the metaphors that it has to offer and also because of its ability to connect to people.”View image in fullscreenA painting by Dr Nia Imara, and photograph of a celestial body.Photograph: Courtesy of Dr Nia Imara, NasaMore than two decades ago, Imara began practicing visual art as a way to exercise another side of her brain and heart. Art, she said, has helped address some of her queries about human connectedness that science failed to answer. In her book, she writes that art and science haven’t always been viewed as diametrically opposed. The Great Pyramid of Giza, in Egypt, which was built as a tomb for Pharaoh Khufu 4,500 years ago, merged science and art as the tallest building in the world until the 1800s. The monument displays precise geometry, and its shape nods to Benben, which was the first mound of land to be created according to ancient Egyptian religion.For Imara, the Great Pyramid is “emblematic of how this incredible society brought together so many fields that we often treat as disparate. And it still blows my mind to think about the precision with which this monument was designed, conceived and constructed with all of the alignments with the cardinal directions, and the really precise alignment of air shafts within the pyramid to certain constellations and stars that were important to the Egyptians.”In pursuit of highlighting the achievements of Black and brown scientists outside her work as an astronomer and visual artist, Imara turned to education to create opportunities for marginalized youth. So she launched her organization Onaketa to offer personalized Stem tutoring to Black and brown youth. Middle and high schoolers are partnered up with Black and brown scientists who tutor them online on a weekly basis for up to a year. Over the past five years, six tutors have mentored more than 100 students throughout the country.“Most of our students have never encountered a Black or brown scientist as a teacher or as a professor,” Imara said. “To have somebody who is also a mentor who can guide them and show them new possibilities for themselves is really important.”View image in fullscreenOnaketa’s annual Dream Big book fair in April 2024 at the Studio One art center in Oakland, California.Photograph: Courtesy of Dr. Nia ImaraImara sees the program as a way to “encourage Black and brown youth who have been actively discouraged and undermined from pursuing these fields. It’s a matter of putting that attention, resources and love towards people who have been actively underserved.”Chima McGruder, an Onaketa mentor since 2021 who has a background in astrophysics, said that along with tutoring students in math through the program, he also serves as a role model for students who can see themselves in him. He’s built up strong connections with some of the students whom he’s mentored for several semesters. “A lot of them don’t get support that they would otherwise in math, or just someone who they can look up to who is not their parents,” McGruder said. “I find those interactions very rewarding and it actually makes me feel like I’m making a difference.”McGruder said that it’s important to expose Black and brown students to Stem fields at an early age since they are largely underrepresented in that sector. While Latinos compose 17% of the workforce across all jobs, they only represent 8% of people in Stem occupations, according to a 2021Pew Research Center analysisof employment data. And Black workers make up 11% of the workforce and 9% of Stem workers. A diversity of perspective ensures that products and medicines are applicable to different populations, since some diseases have a correlation to race, McGruder said: “Who you are and what your background is plays into the things that you create and the standards that you make.”Toward the end of the chapter about the sun’s rhythm in her book, Imara reminds readers that everything they see is a reflection of the sun’s light. And just as the star’s own cycle waxes and wanes, so do the moments of our lives, Imara writes in the book: “A government bent on war and defense will see a potential enemy in everything, including phenomena caused by the innocent sun. An enslaved people see in the same sun a powerful symbol that connects them with home, with their ancestors. It offers a perpetual reminder that life occurs in cycles – rhythms – and thus, their peculiar situation is not permanent.”Explore more on these topicsHistory of scienceRaceAstronomyScience (Education)US educationHistorynewsShareReuse this content"

That compares with harvests of 8m in the late 1980s.Michael Bustamante, chair of Cuban and Cuban-American Studies at the University of Miami, described the situation as “dismal”. “You have to go back to the 19th century to find numbers this low,” he said.Cuba is in the grip ofan all-encompassing economic crisis, and for the past few years has been importing sugar to feed its people, but rum producers do not have the luxury of importing. “The regulations provide that all the liquids have to come from within the country,” an industry executive said, speaking anonymously.It is particularly worrying because the island’s rum industry has been a rare bright spot in its economy. Big international luxury brands are involved, competing in world markets with distinctive Cuban spirits.View image in fullscreenAn operator distributes sugar at a mill in Aguada de Pasajeros, Cienfuegos province, Cuba.Photograph: Adalberto Roque/AFP/GettyDiageo, LVMH and Pernod Ricard all have ventures with the government in Havana, often involving tortuous legal structures to placate OFAC, the US Office of Foreign Assets Control, which polices Washington’ssix-decade-plus trade embargoagainst the island.These companies – and a small British/Norwegian upstart called the Island Rum Company – have invested heavily in their respective brands: Ron Santiago, Eminente, Havana Club and Black Tears. Now there are concerns about their prospects. “It is threatened,” said the executive.Rum as we know it was invented in Cuba in 1862 when a shopkeeper in the coastal city of Santiago thought he could do better than the rot gut then produced in pot stills on the country’s plantations worked by enslaved people. His name was Facundo Bacardí.He began using column stills to distill molasses, a byproduct of sugar refining, selecting theaguardienteliquor on the edge of the pure alcohol, before ageing it in oak. His family, and the rum they produced, became the most famous in Cuba, until they were forced out in the Castro brothers’ 1959 revolution.The Castros wanted Cuba to be financially independent of other countries, a never-ending issue for the island, and sugar was at the heart of their plans. In 1970, they mobilised 500,000 volunteers to create a 10m-tonne harvest.The effort fell short, but at least until the late 1980s Cuba produced around 8m tonnes a year. There was always a lack of investment in the machinery, though, which the government blames on the US embargo.Now the 133 mills at the time of the revolution have been reduced to 14, and only six reportedly still operate. “The sugar production numbers have been steadily decreasing for the better part of 20 years, but particularly over the last five,” said Bustamante. “I think it’s just as clear a signal as you can get over the dire straits of the economy overall.”View image in fullscreenHavana Club’s San José distillery, in San José de las Lajas, Mayabeque province, Cuba.Photograph: Yamil Lage/AFP/GettyThe Enrique Varona sugar mill is in the settlement of Falla, around halfway along the island’s length. On a recent visit, the workers looked exhausted as they lathed a heavy bit of metal in the hope of keeping the great mill running.In contrast, Pernod Ricard’s distillery south of Havana is modern and slick. The French drinks company was the first of the big foreign operations to arrive, doing a deal with Corporación Cuba Ron, the state producer, in 1993. In return for an agreement not to allow other competitors in for 20 years, it took over the Havana Club brand, building sales from 300,000 cases to more than 4m.“They made a huge investment in a moment in which no one had the guts to invest in Cuba,” said Luca Cesarano, who until recently ran the rival brand of Ron Santiago.With the end of that agreement in 2013, others such as Diageo arrived. Unlike Pernod Ricard, they were not distilling themselves, but employing rum makers – known as maestros – to make specific spirits in Cuba’s state distilleries.View image in fullscreenA shop display in Havana.Photograph: Alexandre Meneghini/ReutersThey were also using historical collections of rum that the maestros had for years been storing in oak barrels across the country, even as the roofs of their bodegas grew full of holes.These high-end products have fed an international resurgence in rum. LVMH, the luxury powerhouse, arrived to make Eminente, creating the Hotel Eminente in Paris to promote it. The Island Rum Company has found a strong following in Cuba and abroad by associating itself with young Cuban musicians (its Black Tears brand takes its name from a Cuban song,Lagrimas Negras).But with the supply of molasses drying up, all this work is threatened. “I think the fourth quarter will be particularly tough,” said the executive. “There won’t be any alcohol.”Explore more on these topicsFood & drink industryCubaSugarCaribbeanAmericasCocktailsnewsShareReuse this content"

I stay on top of vacuuming and laundry; I wipe down counters and sinks. But when it comes to appliances and structural issues at home, I don’t know a thing. If you told me my AC was run by a family of small penguins who blow cold air through the vents, I probably wouldn’t believe you, but nor would I have a better explanation.Enter: Kyshawn Lane, the man behind thewildlypopularInstagram accountWeekly Home Check. Every week, Lane posts videos about how to care for your home and the things in it. In a calm, encouraging voice, he demonstrates how to weather-strip your doors or label your electrical circuit breaker box.Lane knows that most of this information is not intuitive. He bought his first home, a 100-year-old house, in 2021. Lane’s family had rented when he was growing up, so he wasn’t used to all the maintenance that comes with owning a house.“I didn’t have much training in how to care for a home,” he says. “I just knocked on the super’s door when something went wrong.”Lane decided to teach himself how to care for his new property. He read books on the topic and attended what he called “YouTube University” (ie watching a lot of home-maintenance videos) and realized these skills could save him from paying contractor fees.Lane and his partner drew up a 52-week checklist for home maintenance. They found it so helpful that they started sharing tips on Instagram. The first video, in June 2023, was about the importance of having a fire extinguisher in the house. Six months later, they had over a million followers.“The content resonated with so many people, whether you were a renter or a seasoned homeowner or a first-time homeowner,” he says. “If you treat your home well, it will repay you in so much love and care and comfort.”I wanted to treat my home well. I wanted love and comfort, and for my appliances to work properly – and to appear as calm and competent as Lane. Over the phone, he outlined four basic-home maintenance tasks I could start with.Flush your drainsThe drain in my bathroom sink hasn’t been working properly. Maybe it was the earring I lost in there, the hair I always seem to be shedding or the multiple birth control and SSRI pills I have accidentally dropped into its depths.My hours seem to slip away. How can I manage my time better?Read moreTo address this, I need two very basic ingredients. As I will come to find out, there’s almost nothing they can’t do. “Vinegar and baking soda in a home will change your life,” Lane says.According to Lane’svideo, I should pour ½ cup of baking soda down the drain, followed by about ¼ cup of vinegar, and cover the drain opening with a wet towel to trap the reaction. After 10-15 minutes, flush everything out with boiling water. Lane suggests repeating this every two to three months to clear out any grease and hair that accumulates.One afternoon, I set a small pot of water on the stove to boil, grab baking soda, vinegar, measuring cups and a towel and head to the bathroom.I pour the mixture down the drain and let it sit, and then I return with the boiling water. I remove the towel and pour the water into the sink, but to my horror, it just sits there. The baking soda and vinegar have not cleared the drain; they seem to have further clogged it. I wonder how I’m going to break it to my partner and to my beloved building maintenance team. I pace nervously. After several minutes, I hear loud gurgling and gulping sounds from the bathroom. I rush to the sink, which is now empty, the water sucked down into the pipes. I run more water, which rushes quickly and smoothly away.I brag to my partner about the unclogged drain, and leave out the part where I thought I had ruined our pipes.Film everything you ownLane’s next tip was to film a home-inventory video. This is important for both homeowners and renters, he explains: in the case of a major disaster, like flooding or a fire, having a record of your possessions can help when filing claims with both homeowner’s and renter’s insurance. (Insurers have different requirements for claims, so it’s important to talk to your insurance company before making your inventory.)skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWell ActuallyFree weekly newsletterPractical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good lifeEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

My cat follows me around, captivated, and climbs into every closet, cabinet and drawer, making it almost impossible to see their contents. My video is six minutes long, and the only thing I can prove I own is a camera-thirsty black cat.Rotate and clean your mattressIn his week eight video, Lane recommendsmattress maintenance: specifically, rotating it 180 degrees to prevent sagging, and vacuuming the mattress to remove the dust, dead skin and allergens that can accumulate on its surface. He suggests doing this twice a year.I strip the bed, rotate the mattress, vacuum it, and report my progress to my partner, who is at work. “Sick,” he texts back. I thump down onto the newly primped mattress. It feels the same, but I enjoy knowing I’m not stretched across a bunch of dead skin. Also, it forced me to wash my sheets.Deep-clean your dishwasher“People don’t know how much maintenance goes into appliances,” Lane tells me. “People don’t know dishwashers need to be cleaned!”“Wow,” I say, having never once considered cleaning my dishwasher.Cleanse, moisturize and protect: how to start a skincare routineRead moreLane breaks down the process in avideo: take out the dishes, remove the dishwasher racks, spray arm and filters. One tip is to film yourself doing this so you don’t forget the order in which these all sit. Clean them all in the sink. Then, spray the inside of the washer with vinegar, and wipe it down with a damp microfiber towel. “Pay attention to the edges and the soap dispensers, as this is where a lot of the gunk and build-up happens,” he says in the video. Then replace all the parts, and run a normal cycle. Lane suggests repeating this every one to three months.I hate this task the most. Taking out the racks, spray arm and filter is surprisingly easy. But I hate looking at the filter, and wish I could go back to not knowing it exists. The gunk on it looks like dryer lint, but wet. Gross. When I spray vinegar into the interior, it combines with the stale water to create a noxious bouquet that reminds me of a pubescent armpit. I wipe it down, replace the racks, and run a cycle.Afterwards, I make my partner admire my work. “I don’t think you have to wash the dishwasher,” he says.Will I repeat this in another month or three? Probably not. I like knowing that I can do it, though. And rotating my mattress and cleaning my drains is easy enough. Overall, I consider my home-maintenance experiment a success. I even have a lovely six-minute long video of my cat now.Explore more on these topicsWell actuallyHome improvementsRenting propertyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It was all sketch, absurdity, silliness. I didn’t get into standup until my university days because I just didn’t think it was a vocation, especially not in New Zealand.You served four years in the New Zealand army when you were a young man. Did it inform your career in comedy at all?I grew up watchingDad’s Armywith my mum, and that’s one of the reasons I joined up. I thought all the action would be fun. I brought my sense of humour with me so got told off a lot. Turns out, it wasn’t really Dad’s Army but itwasthe New Zealand army, so it wasn’t too far off. We had moments where we were literally rescuing sheep.

They wanted to have me on the inaugural flight as an entertainer. It was at 8am. People started looking at me like I was a threat. I did some weird stuff about clouds and some of the airline upholstery. One thing you’d never do as a standup is go and sit with your audience if it goes badly. But I had no other choice. One guy said to me, “Why’d you do that?” I said, “I got paid.” No one believed it.What has inspired your latest show, The Legend Returns?It’s about me fighting against artificial intelligence. Back in the day it was fun when robots were robots, but now it’s actually getting quite scary. The future doesn’t look good – especially in creativity. AI should just leave us alone because all it’s doing is plagiarising us, stealing our stuff, and people are then taking advantage of that.It’s a huge subject matter, but I do it in a very silly way, a very human way. I think there’s no robot that could do what I do, and that includes all the flaws. When I screw up, when I break the fourth wall, take the mickey out of myself or laugh at myself or what I’m doing, that’s very human.Do you have any pre-show rituals?I stretch because I do a lot of physical comedy. Drink water. I normally have one beer to make me remember the good old rock’n’roll days.What’s one of the strangest encounters with a fan you’ve had?I’ve had a lot of things made for me. Depending on my material, they’ll find something in the stories I tell. Back in the day, I said I was the freestyle dance champion of a small town called Ohakune in New Zealand. So someone knitted me a woollen jacket that had “dance champion” on the back. Also, someone made a small bust of me once. I remember withFlight of the Conchords, Jemaine Clement once received a plaster impression of his lips. I don’t know how they did it, but to present something to you that isofyou is insane. Luckily, no one’s given me a full clay model of my nose or anything like that.Did you have any idea when filming thatFlight of the Conchordswould have such lasting cultural impact?I don’t think we did. And that was good, because we really felt like we were making this thing for ourselves. Because we were young and it was our first time in the States making something with their money and their brilliance, we got caught up in it all. We just concentrated on how could we be so funny that we’re cracking each other up and have to redo the scene?As we had some control over the show, we could improvise and do seven or eight takes. And that was really the key, because I got funnier every take. I know that for a fact. I still say this to people when I do shows. I say give me a couple more because I’ll peak on the sixth take.View image in fullscreenPirate captain … Darby with Fred Armisen in Our Flag Means Death.Photograph: Album/AlamyWithOur Flag Means Death, you went from “that guy from Flight of the Conchords” to a Tumblr sex symbol overnight. What wasthat like?I’m a comedy guy, not a sex symbol. [Pirate character] Stede wore some very attractive attire but is still a very insecure, bizarre, weird little man who has to try and find himself. The character was perfect for me because I like dressing up, being the captain, and I do overcompensate with authority because I really have no idea what I’m doing. There were definitely some similarities there, but I was not expecting anything on a sexual note from fans. The audience are amazing. They really come to the table, but it was a little bit too much for me.You’ve long had a passion for cryptozoology. What draws you to creatures like Bigfoot and Mothman?It’s the mystery of the unknown. I think I’ve always thought of myself as someone that mysteriously shouldn’t be here. I was a mistake as a child, as I was born nine years after the rest of my siblings, so I think I’ve always had this belief in what else is out there.I think these things are real. Not all of them, but I love the idea that we don’t really know and we can search. The search for stuff that we don’t know yet – I think that’s one of our purposes here.Rhys Darby: The Legend Returns ison tourin the UK and Ireland until 29 June, and atPleasance Courtyard, Edinburgh, 1-10 AugustExplore more on these topicsStageComedy Q&AComedy (Stage)Comedy (Culture)Flight of the ConchordsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

For decades the LA-based investment fund had specialised in picking up what is known in the trade as distressed assets, a strategy it described as looking for “good companies with bad balance sheets”.So let’s say your company is screwed. You’re deep in debt, severely short of cash, perhaps even at risk of bankruptcy or default. In sweep Oaktree. They have a mosey around, shake down some creditors, restructure your cost base, perhaps offer you a high‑interest loan to stop the bleeding. Once they’ve got you battle-lean they find you a buyer, you sell up, and they take a fat cut. Four years ago, as they cast an eye over the Covid-emaciated carcass of Inter, this was exactly the strategy they had in mind.Qatar bid to complete football with PSG project’s crowd-pleasing third act | Barney RonayRead moreOaktree never intended to own Inter. Their objective was to sustain the ownership of Chinese conglomerate Suning for as long it took to help them sell up, and then cash in. But as the debts accumulated and successive restructurings failed, potential buyers took flight. When Suning defaulted on a debt repayment last May, Oaktreetook over the club pretty much by default. And over the course of 12 months you might say what began as a distressed debt has unexpectedly turned into an opportunistic credit.Saturday evening’s Champions League final is a jarring and stirring clash of styles in so many ways. The relentless attack of Paris Saint-Germain and the relentless defence of Inter. One team built on thefreehand wizardry of youthand one built on theweathered edifice of experience. Flying wingers against flying wing-backs, two strikers against none. But perhaps the biggest philosophical difference is between two radically different models of a football club itself: who it serves, what it can be, what constitutes success, and how to get there.At which point we feel duty-bound to point out just how thrilling and charismatic this young PSG team are, how humble and local, how refreshingly unlike their predecessors. But of course this is still a team assembled at eyewatering expense. Désiré Doué, that lovable homegrown winger: yeah, he cost £45m. Bradley Barcola, he was £40m. Then there was the £60m casually dropped onKhvicha Kvaratskhelia in the January window, an unimaginable expense for most Champions League sides, let alone PSG’s domestic rivals.View image in fullscreenDesiré Doué cost PSG £45m.Photograph: Franco Arland/Getty ImagesObviously this has always been the calculation in Paris: that immense wealth, plus royalty, multiplied by immaculate PR, equals effortless class. Move quickly, break things, make new things. In a way, the pivot-to-likable is simply another example of Parisian/Qatari soft power, the ability to reshape a narrative, another perfectly executed branding exercise by a state where women can still lose their right to financial support if they refuse to have sex with their husband “without a legitimate reason”.And of course PSG can afford all this, can bin off failing players, can wear the big losses, because their mission is far bigger than oneChampions League, one Deloitte money list, bigger even than football. In a way Qatari investment has been the ultimate 4D chess game: a complex apparatus of sportswashing and political favour and designer leisurewear, erected over more than a decade and whose success can only ever partly be measured by Marquinhos’s ability to head away corners.The American investor model, by contrast, measures value in much starker terms. Here the profligacy of PSG is met by the distressed austerity of Inter, an empire not so much being built as nibbled away. Prized assets like Achraf Hakimi and André Onana must be sold to make way for older, budget replacements. Of course there can be no long-term vision here with your ageing squad and council-owned stadium and depressed commercial value. Qatar Airways pay PSG £60m a year for shirt sponsorship; last year a similar offer to Inter was worth around a quarter of that.Howard Marks, the co-founder of Oaktree, often explains investing strategies using sporting analogies. “If we avoid the losers, the winners will take care of themselves,” goes one of his maxims. As a result of their improbable, hugely impressive run to the Champions League final, Inter have already swollen in value: over £1bn, according to some estimates. They are no longer a financial shambles. Whatever happens from here, Oaktree’s initial investment has paid off handsomely.View image in fullscreenSimone Inzaghi has worked with a limited budget at Inter.Photograph: James Gill/Danehouse/Getty ImagesSo, while fans scream for investment in the squad, a new stadium, a transfer war chest to keep Simone Inzaghi at the club, for the dispassionate investor the temptation to sit on this gently appreciating asset, to wait it out, must be immense. No Champions League, noscudetto, no problem: just a secure annual yield, pure viability, pure opportunistic credit.Inter probably go into this game as the favoured choice of most neutrals and purists. But on a sporting level, is either of these models really more romantic than the other? Not really. In the same way that Ousmane Dembélé and Warren Zaïre-Emery are not consciously playing for a state investment fund, Oaktree are not really doing it for the Curva Nord, for the ghosts of Herrera and Facchetti, for the hallowed reputation of Italian football.Until clubs are genuinely owned by their people, these are the sorts of compromises we will continue to endure. A vehicle for geopolitics against a vehicle for pure profit; vulture despotism against cold vulture capitalism. As it ever was in modern football: choose your fighter.Explore more on these topicsChampions LeagueInternazionaleParis Saint-GermaincommentShareReuse this content"

Go out there and put a graft in,’” said Beever-Jones. “I think her exact words were ‘Destroy them’, in her Dutch accent. For us, it was just executing the gameplan.”Alessia Russo has nailed down the No 9 shirt following the retirement of Ellen White after the Euros in 2022, but a fitting substitute and challenger to her has been missing. Beever-Jones staked her claim in front of 48,531 fans, her hat-trick in a five-goal first-half blitz coming in only her second England start.It was a heartening win for the Lionesses as they focus all eyes on this summer’s Euros in Switzerland. It also secured England second place in Nations League Group A3, two points behind Spain before they go head to head on Tuesday.Wiegman’s England ship, so used to sailing under clear skies, hit choppier water this week, the retirement announcement of Euro 2022 winner Mary Earps, just 39 days out from the team beginning their title defence, sending shockwaves through St George’s Park.View image in fullscreenChloe Kelly came on as a substitute in the second half and scored within four minutes, heading home Beth Mead’s pinpoint cross.Photograph: Shaun Botterill/Getty ImagesWiegman implied in April that Hannah Hampton had leapfrogged Earps in the pecking order, when she described the Chelsea goalkeeper as being “a little bit ahead”. It was hoped that Earps would act as the elder stateswoman of a group of young keepers and provide substantial backup to Hampton, with Anna Moorhouse and Khiara Keating currently uncapped.Earps’ exit is undoubtedly a blow, as was the absence of Millie Bright, unavailable through choice for being “mentally and physically at my limits”. However, nothing buries bad news as well as good news and such an emphatic win over Portugal, with a starting XI looking a little different from how it will shape up in Switzerland, certainly helps.It took just three minutes for Beever-Jones to put the home team ahead, pouncing on a loose ball after good pressure from Jess Park before putting it coolly beyond goalkeeper Inês Pereira. Two minutes later and England had their second. Jess Carter, fresh from a Concacaf Champions Cup win with Gotham FC, won the ball and it was worked to Mead. Her shot was blocked but the ball fell to Lucy Bronze, who headed into an empty net.In her first Wembley start, Beever-Jones’ second goal arrived with a header from a Bronze cross. Mead joined the party for England’s fourth, Park shrugging off Dolores Silva before releasing her to nutmeg Catarina Amado and fire in.Beever-Jones’s hat-trick was completed in the 33rd minute, making her the second England women’s player to score a Wembley treble after Mead. A long ball from Leah Williamson, one of five of Arsenal’s Champions League winners in the squad, alongside Mead, Lotte Wubben-Moy, Russo and Chloe Kelly, found the forward, who took a couple of touches before firing in low at the near post.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

She is really tight on the ball. The team did well coming into positions so the connections were really good. She played really relaxed.”It would be easy, and a little lazy, to describe Portugal, ranked 22nd in the world, as pushovers. They were poor defensively but this is a team who have been a small thorn in the side of Wiegman’s England. The Lionesses were held to a 1-1 draw in the reverse fixture in February and a 0-0 draw in a friendly on the eve of the World Cup in July 2023. In fact, England’s last victory against them came towards the end of Phil Neville’s tenure, a sloppy 1-0 win amid a sea of draws and defeats in October 2019.England calmed down a little in the second half, but three changes around the hour re-energised the players, who have clawed their way to the end of a long season only to be straight back in with their national team. Substitute Kelly added the team’s sixth, heading in Mead’s cross.There were no more goals but it was an emphatic and entertaining performance, the off-pitch drama comfortably excluded to leave England focused on preparing for the Euros.Explore more on these topicsWomen's Nations LeagueEngland women's football teamPortugal women’s football teamWomen's footballmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

He has enjoyed achievements that most dream of, winning a Masters 1000 title, reaching the semi-finals of Wimbledon and breaking into the world’s top 10, but it is not merely results that have set him apart.Instead of taking the traditional route to the professional circuit directly from junior competitions, Norrie decided to move at his own pace. He spent three successful years at Texas Christian University in Fort Worth where he developed his game, matured as a person and partied until he was ready to fully commit.French Open 2025: Swiatek, Rune and Sabalenka all advance on day six – liveRead moreNorrie ensured that when he finally made it to the professional ranks, he was disciplined and resilient enough to fulfil his potential. He settled down on the ATP Tour before enjoying a dramatic, unexpected rise towards the top of the game. Any player with ambitions on making it to the Tour after competing in college understands the significance of Norrie’s route to success.Since ending his time at TCU in 2017, Norrie has kept in close touch with the university and he regularly interacts with many former students and coaches, plenty of whom still work there. When he is in the United States, he sometimes uses the university facilities in Fort Worth for short training blocks.It was during one trip there in the late summer of 2019, as Norrie prepared for the US Open, that he trained with one of the many players who looked up to him – an 18-year-old Scottish freshman named Jacob Fearnley. On Saturday Norrie and Fearnley, who have trained together times since, will compete against each other on one of the biggest stages in their sport with a place in the fourth round of theFrench Openon the line.View image in fullscreenCameron Norrie is back in form after a difficult 18 months that saw him drop to No 91 in the world rankings.Photograph: David Winter/ShutterstockAlthough Norrie played no direct role in Fearnley’s college decisions, the Scot has clearly followed the path blazed by the elder Briton. He also opted to compete in college before turning professional and he also ended up at TCU. He arrived in Texas two years after Norrie left. “To see a guy going to the college that I went to, seeing how well he did coming out of college, it was more just inspiring, showed me that it was possible, that the coaches at TCU and the work that he put in at TCU could get him to the Tour,” said Fearnley.This third-round match is the first time in the open era that two British players, men or women, have faced each other after round one at Roland Garros. It will also represent a significant opportunity for both players. After his supreme opening victory against Daniil Medvedev, the 11th seed and former world No 1, this is a chance for Norrie, 29, to establish real momentum after a difficult 18 months in which he fell from the top 20 to as low as No 91 this month. For Fearnley, meanwhile, this is yet another chance for him to break new ground by reaching the fourth round of a grand slam for the first time. The 23-year-old’s rise over the past 11 months has been one of the most absorbing stories in the sport. He has flitted up the rankings at a startling pace since finishing his college career last year and he is now on the verge of breaking into the top 50 for the first time.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I think that’s probably an area that we’ve underperformed in for a while.” Perhaps nobody epitomised that more than Amy Jones, who in 12 years of international cricket – including 97 ODIs – had never scored a century.On Friday at Derby, with Edwards grinning away on the dressing room balcony, Jones punched through the off side for the boundary which finally broke that duck. They say the years are short, while the days are long: the five overs which Jones spent in the nervous 90s felt almost as long as the 12 years which preceded them.England beat West Indies by 108 runs: first women’s cricket one-day international – live reactionRead moreFirst, the umpires called for drinks; then Jones offered up two nervy return catches to Jahzara Claxton and Karishma Ramharack, which were both shelled; and finally her opening partner Tammy Beaumont got impatient and decided to beat Jones to the milestone, having played second fiddle for almost the whole of their record-breaking 222-run partnership. When the vital boundary from Jones finally came, the celebrations were partly just relief to have got a very big monkey off a very senior back.In the light of Thursday’s news that Heather Knight is out for the rest of the summer with the hamstring injury she sustained at Chelmsford, this was a good time for the rest of England’s batters to stand up and be counted: Jones’ and Beaumont’s centuries, combined with a second 50 in three matches from the captain, Nat Sciver-Brunt, provided the platform for England’s formidable total of 345 for six.In reply, a chaotic innings from Qiana Joseph set the tone: the left-hander scored 62 from 74 balls simply by swinging and hoping. But Alice Capsey eventually arrowed one into Joseph’s stumps and with Hayley Matthews already long-departed – a decent maiden ODI wicket for Em Arlott – the stage was set for England’s second debutant, Linsey Smith, to bamboozle West Indies’ middle order.View image in fullscreenAmy Jones with her player of the match award after England beat West Indies.Photograph: Nathan Stirk/ECB/Getty Images“I wasn’t getting too much bounce today, which worked nicely for me,” Smith said. “I just try and target the stumps as much as possible and wait for them to make mistakes.”The left-arm spinner – who made her 20-over debut in 2018 – said that she had never given up hope on the “dream” of playing ODI cricket, despite the seven-year wait. “Being out in the Ashes and only being in the T20 squad, just made me reflect and want to really put my hand up and put up a fight and try and change the story of what 50-over cricket’s like for England,” she said.Fittingly, it was Sophia Dunkley, who before play had presented Smith with her cap, who pouched two good catches in the deep – the second off the final ball of Smith’s 10-over allocation – to ensure her teammate (just) achieved her five-fer. From there it was slow death for West Indies, who clung on until the 49th over but were eventually all out for 237.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionIn her first two months as head coach, Edwards has kept a close eye on county cricket, which may explain England’s new-look opening partnership: Beaumont and Jones have already scored 237 runs together for The Blaze in seven One-Day Cup matches this season. While the pair started sedately at Derby, there was a dramatic acceleration in the 26th over: Beaumont came down the track to Matthews, fired the first six of the day over long-on and proceeded to add another 50 runs in just 22 balls.The highlight was a 25-run over against Jahzara Claxton, during which the diminutive Beaumont leapt into the air as if she had launched herself off a trampoline and somehow upper-cut a ball a metre above her head to the boundary.Spare a thought for Emma Lamb, who after a two-year absence from internationals was adjudged caught behind to Matthews after just three balls. She will be hoping for a chance at vindication when the two sides go again, at Leicester on Wednesday.Explore more on these topicsWomen's cricketEngland women's cricket teamWest Indies WomenCricketmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

United’s stance remains that Fernandes is not for sale and Amorim doubled down on that position after watching his team beat Hong Kong 3-1 in a post-season friendly on Friday. He views his countryman as vital to the club’s future. The 30-year-old was named United’s player of the season for a record-equalling fourth time. He is contracted to the clubuntil June 2027.Asked if the win over Hong Kong may prove to be Fernandes’ final appearance for United, Amorim said: “I don’t think so. I don’t know for sure, nobody knows, but I don’t think so. I think he’s seeing us taking some actions to change things and that’s all he asks.Football Daily | Fear and loathing in Kuala Lumpur: Manchester United’s tour is going wellRead more“I think he wants to stay. He is saying no to a lot of things, but that shows he wants to win. He’s really young, he’s really good, he needs to be in the best league in the world.”Amorim denied United would be forced to cash in on Fernandes in order to generate transfer funds. The club’s failure to qualify for the Champions League after a catastrophic campaign means finances will be tight this summer, with United needing to sell several players before they can buy. “We can find another way to earn money,” Amorim said. Alejandro Garnacho, who started alongside Fernandes in Hong Kong, could well be sold, while Marcus Rashford, Antony and Jadon Sancho – all of whom spent time away from Old Trafford on loan this season – are for sale.Afterlosing 1-0 to Asean All-Stars in their first post-season friendlyin Malaysia, United again fell behind in Hong Kong. But after Juninho’s 19th-minute opener for the hosts, young striker Chido Obi scored twice after replacing Rasmus Højlund for the second half.Obi’s first was a smart left-footed finish after he turned under pressure in the box following Manuel Ugarte’s tackle. The 17-year-old then glanced Mason Mount’s cross into the net to snatch the lead eight minutes from time. Fellow former Arsenal youngster Ayden Heaven completed the victory in added time when he met Amad Diallo’s ball with a powerful header. The goals were Obi and Heaven’s first senior strikes for United, albeit not in a competitive fixture.United are not in action again until 19 July when they take on Leeds in Stockholm, before a pre-season tour of the US where they will play West Ham, Bournemouth and Everton. Fernandes is expected to feature for Portugal in the Nations League semi-finals against Germany on 4 June. The final and third-place playoff are set for 8 June.Explore more on these topicsManchester UnitedRuben AmorimTransfer windownewsShareReuse this content"

That is hardly a revolutionary prediction in a sport that has long since rained down on us the 21st century’s manna of entertainment at all costs, but even by those standards this weekend’s last round of thePremiershippromises bounty.The science of prediction is at best hit and miss, but one blind alley all too many “experts” get lost down is consideration of tactics, gameplans and the like, when all that really matters is a team’s motivation. Purity of desire is a special ingredient in a side’s prospects for any individual match. This weekend we have five matches, and they all might be summarised as a team with something to play for versus a team with nothing.Lions match highlights on free-to-air TV this summer – with Welsh commentaryRead moreThat is an explosive mix at the best of times, but in this era of tries, tries and outrageous comebacks it is all the more so. Team A is chasing a place in the playoffs, so they burst into the match like men possessed. Either they rack up a massive score in no time at all and relax, whereupon Team B start to chance their arm, because why not; or Team A overextend themselves in pursuit of their goal, and Team B pick them off, because all of these teams can play the rugby of the gods. Either way, there will be tries.Bath are top of the table, and the only side mathematically guaranteed a place in the playoffs. They have scored 92 tries across 17 matches, a rate of 5.4 a match, comfortably the highest of any team in Premiership history, bar this season’s second highest try-scorers – see below.People talk about the Premiership’s entertainment quotient as if it were a new thing, when actually it has been so for several years. For context, 2009-10 was a nadir in rugby union’s quest for entertainment at all costs. It is difficult to say why this was the case. The dreaded experimental law variations had come in the summer before but had never taken off.A personal memory, nevertheless, of the season that followed is of teams terrified of having the ball, because of the leeway afforded to that most dread of concepts, “the jackler”. Check all the data about tries scored, metres gained, line breaks, all the usual indicators of a “good match”, and they are way down for that one season, across all competitions.Quick GuidePremiership: final-day fixturesShow(4th)Bristol v Harlequins(7th)(9th)Exeter v Sale(3rd)(5th)Gloucester v Northampton(8th)(2nd)Leicester v Newcastle(10th)(6th)Saracens v Bath(1st)All games kick off at 3.05pm (BST)Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Bath, as it happens, finished the regular season as top try-scorers in 2009-10 as well, with 49 tries across 22 matches – or a rate of 2.2 tries a match. So there has been quite some progress on that front. It happened more quickly than most commentators would have it, but there is no denying, too, that with each season the entertainment quotient has continued to climb – and this has already been the best yet.This weekend, Bath have nothing to play for. They have just won their second piece of silverware this season, the Challenge Cup, but they have done all they can to position themselves advantageously for the one they really want, the Premiership. All you could say is that they might want to finish off the one side who have dominated this competition in recent years,Saracens, once and for all.View image in fullscreenGeorge Ford (left) has been in fine form this season.Photograph: Steve Taylor/PPAUK/ShutterstockSaracens host Bath this weekend, and qualification is out of their hands. It feels weird just writing that. They will have to win anyway, with maximum points, and hope enough teams slip up ahead of them. All the while keeping at bay the most prolific team in Premiership history.

We are assuming maximum points there for the Tigers and the other home playoff berth confirmed. Elsewhere, Sale travel to Exeter, hoping to clinch the third playoff spot. Exeter are the only team with nothing to play for who are also at home, but Sale have a couple of Lions – and George Ford, who is the best player in the British Isles at the moment.Gloucester are playing for a place in the playoffs too, at home againstNorthampton, the current champions. They are the third highest try-scorers in this season of try-scoring, but they need someone above them to lose.We all know who that could be. The game of the weekend is down the M5 in Bristol. If two teams encapsulate this era of try-scoring, unpredictable wildness, it is Bristol andHarlequins. Bristol are the second highest try-scorers this season, with 87, a rate of 5.1 a match. They have also conceded more (76 – 4.4 a match) than anyone bar bottom-placed Newcastle.The greatest match this correspondent has ever covered wasBristol’s playoff semi-final against Quinsin 2021-22, the year Quins went on to win their second title. Bristol, who had finished top of the table, were 28-0 up after half an hour; Harlequins won 43-36 after extra time.Bristol have it all to play for at Ashton Gate on Saturday; Quins have nothing. Should be straightforward. But predictions with these two are for fools.

The letter stated that in the event of a challenge by the federation or by World Boxing to Khelif’s sex certification, Khelif would remain ineligible to compete until the dispute was resolved.Speaking to ITV News in March about the row over her involvement at the Olympics, Khelif said: “I see myself as a girl, just like any other girl. I was born a girl, raised as a girl and have lived my entire life as one.“I have competed in many tournaments, including the Tokyo Olympics and other major competitions, as well as four world championships. All of these took place before I started winning and earning titles. But once I began achieving success, the campaigns against me started.”All athletes over 18 wishing to compete in a World Boxing owned or sanctioned event will need to undergo a PCR (polymerase chain reaction) genetic test to determine their sex at birth and their eligibility to compete.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Prodhomme, from the Decathlon AG2R La Mondiale team, broke free on the fourth climb to take the lead and eventually the victory to become the first Frenchman to win a Giro stage this year.Giro d’Italia: Denz surges to stage win as Del Toro keeps hold of pink jerseyRead more“I’ve worked a lot for this Giro d’Italia,” Prodhomme said. “I didn’t want to compete for the GC, I wanted to try and win a stage. I’ve waited for long for this win to come. I won my first race three weeks ago [on the Tour of the Alps] but to win at the Giro d’Italia makes me very happy. It’s a beautiful day.”Prodhomme had attacked with more than seven kilometres left to the summit and he quickly put distance between himself and the stage 15 winner, Carlos Verona, and Antonio Tiberi, while the group with Del Toro was more than a minute behind. As the general classification battle raged behind him, the 28-year-old pushed ahead and on the home stretch, he emerged through a cloud of pink smoke, holding his helmet in disbelief as he crossed the line to win by nearly a minute.“Our breakaway didn’t have a big gap. I didn’t feel great when I followed the first attacks. My legs were stiff on the first climb. Kilometre after kilometre, I felt better on the bike,” Prodhomme said.“On Col de Joux, I realised that I needed to take risks – otherwise we were going nowhere … Before today I’ve had two top-five finishes because I don’t take a lot of risks.

At some level you have to salute Donald Trump’s ability to turn even the world’s richest man into an Apprentice candidate who leaves in week four after completely wiping out in the hotdog stand task.Musk arrived in government promising toslash spending by $2tn. He leaves it a mere $1.86tn short of that target, even by his own estimations. Meanwhile, the president’s new tax bill is set to add $2.3tn to the deficit. I imagine Musk thought his government finale would be a spectacular extravaganza – “you’re welcome, Washington!” – involving 2,000 chainsaw-wielding chorus girls. Instead, it’s a tweet. And yes – we DO all still call them tweets.Ironically, the thing that Musk has been most stunningly effective at slashing is his own reputation. Think about it. He arrived in Trump’s orbit as a somewhat mysterious man, widely regarded as a tech genius, and a titan of the age. He leaves it with vast numbers of people woken up to the fact he’s a weird andcreepy breeding fetishist, who desperately pretends to be good at video games, and wasn’t remotely as key to SpaceX or Tesla’s engineering prowess as they’d vaguely thought. Also, with a number of them apparently convinced he had a botched penile implant. Rightly or wrongly convinced – sure. I’m just asking questions.But look, it’s good news for Tesla investors, who have managed to end Musk’s practice of WFWH (working from White House), and are now demandinghe puts in a 40-hour weekto save the company whose stock he has spent the past few months tanking. As the world order dramatically seeks to rearrange itself in the new era of US unreliability, no one should ever be able to unsee the president of the United States’s decision to turn the White House lawn into acar sales lot for his sad friend. Did it work? It seems not. Musk spent a lot of this week airing his hurt feelings about his brrm-brrm cars. “People were burning Teslas,”he whinedto Jeff Bezos’s Washington Post. “Why would you do that? That’s really uncool.”Well, one thing we will no longer have to endure is this guy’s decrees on what is or isn’t cool. The timeworn thing about money and power is that they allow nerds to reinvent themselves as cool. You see it on Wall Street, where sea-beast financiers get manscaped by trophy wives who are no longer out of their league. You see it in Hollywood, where weird little guys become alpha movie producers. You see it inBezos’s transformationfrom puffy-chinos-wearing, dress-down-Friday dweeb to Bilderberg Vin Diesel impersonator. What you rarely see is the alchemy of that process in reverse, live and in real time. But we got that with Elon, and we have to take our laughs where we can. In some other businesses, Musk could have convinced himself it wasn’t happening, but politics is a place where pollsters literally ask real people what they think of public figures every single week. Elon’sapproval ratingsare underwater.No doubt we’re this close to him identifying the real problem: that we simply need new voters. Musk has long been convinced that people don’t know how to handle his genius in all fields. Four years ago, he hosted Saturday Night Live, and sometime afterwardsrevealed on a podcasthow the cast and writers had reacted to the uncontainably hilarious suggestions made by him and his team of bros. “We come in just, like, guns blazing with ideas,” he honked, explaining he’d pitched a … bit, is it? … where he was “going to take my cock out. So I’m going to reach down into my pants … and then I pull out a baby rooster. Like, ‘This is my tiny cock.’” Oh very good, sir. Absolute genius, sir. Presumably terrified that they would lose their jobs for ever to this superlative talent, the SNL team declined to “yes-and” this genius sketch into the final show running order, but Musk managed to get his own back – at least in his account of hosting an episode with aflattering 13% ratingon Rotten Tomatoes. “There’s a bunch of things that I said that were just not on the script. They have these cue cards for what you’re supposed to say, and I just didn’t say it. I just went off the rails.”Mm. Just like you have now. As for where Musk goes next, he’s obviouslybuilding a Texan compoundfor the mothers of his many babies. But, psychologically, Mars would seem to be the answer. After a humiliation this big, only colonising another planet feels like the appropriately sized salve. It doesn’t matter that Mars is an obvious shithole that looks like the least appealing disused quarry on Earth – a place so bleak and empty that if they found one single fossilised flower it would be celebrated like the holy grail, even though the impossible majesty of the Amazon rainforest is right here. But of course, the point of Mars is that it would be the place of Elon, Teslamandias, king of kings. And you know, I feel more confident than ever that we could all look upon his works and despair.Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsElon MuskOpinionTrump administrationUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

It wasn’t long before we all started to realise quite how big and quite how bad.After a day of joyous celebration that turned Liverpool into a sea of brilliant red, hundreds of fans were heading back into the city when they looked up to see an ambulance moving through a temporarily pedestrianised route on its way to help a stricken individual. The fans, anxious to assist, moved to the side, when aFord Galaxy suddenly emergedfrom behind it and in a few terrible moments, turned elation and harmony into chaos and pain.At a time when social media is such an unreliable and often malicious source of information, we had to try to verify exactly what had happened in Water Street and the truly grim clips that emerged made us all fear the absolute worst.I am still amazed and relieved that no lives were lost. The news that those who were hospitalised are said to be stable and recovering well is something everyone in this city and beyond will continue to treasure.And we are also grateful for the many stories of kindness, generosity and that well-known scouse solidarity that have offered rays of sunshine to combat the dark cloud that Monday evening’s events have left hanging over this unique and vibrant place. On Thursday, Paul Doyle, a 53-year-old man from Liverpool, was charged with multiple offences in connection with the attack and will make his first court appearance on Friday.Those qualities of solidarity so in evidence this week will continue to be needed. I’m talking about the dozens of Liverpool pubs that kept their doors open late into the night as people left stranded and separated from loved ones tried to figure out their plans amid the chaos. I’m talking about the cabbies and car owners who flooded social media with offers of free lifts.I’m talking about Kerrie and John Davies from Wallasey, who – along with staff from their travel company – ran continual free shuttle buses to help more than 400 people get home from Liverpool city centre. And I’mtalking about Ellis Matthews, whose dad was hit by the car as it ploughed along Water Street and who chased after it with many others, bravely putting their own lives at risk as they fought to stop the driver from injuring anyone else.There are many, many more examples that show how the people of this city and this region did what they always do: step up when people need them the most. A glance at social media on that frantic night showed the best of humanity – as offers of help poured in – but of course it showed the very worst as well. It wasn’t long before a grim parade of bad faith actors were springing gleefully on to the trauma of what those in Water Street had faced, desperate to stir up hatred, division and chaos in the name of whatever malevolent cause they currently subscribe to.Our region knows just how dangerous such actions can be. We sawwhat happened after Southport. We know the pivotal role that poisonous misinformation played in bringing that hell to our streets. Merseyside police officers were among the first to arrive at those unspeakable scenes in Southport last summer, and some of the same officers found themselves being attacked by bricks from an angry, misinformed mob the next night.It is clear that the force was desperate to avoid such turmoil after Monday’s incident in Water Street, and the decision toquickly release the factthat the only suspect was a white British man from Liverpool and that the incident was not being treated as terrorism was entirely understandable and – because of that painful context – the correct one.View image in fullscreenTrouble flares during a protest in Southport, after three children died and eight were injured at a dance school, July 2024.Photograph: Richard McCarthy/PABut it won’t be enough for some. There are many operating in the hellscape of social media today who will never be content with any explanation that doesn’t fit their narrative. There are still plenty who are continuing to plaster all kinds of bizarre and unfounded conspiracies across social media in an increasingly desperate bid for validation and engagement – without a second thought for those who are continuing to recover.As journalists all we can do to counter this rising torrent of online bile is to report the facts as and when we get them – and only when we know them to be true. We have to hope that the quiet majority will turn to trusted sources at times of uncertainty and trauma.One fact we absolutely know to be true is that Liverpool is a resilient city. This is a place with a spirit of mind, character and solidarity forged through the collective painful experiences of Hillsborough, of Thatcher, of austerity. It is a place that has picked itself up off the canvas time and time again – and has done so with extra resolve, with even more fortitude, with another big helping of togetherness.That powerful concoction will be badly needed as Liverpool comes to terms with a day of celebration that turned into a night of devastation. But if any city can come together and recover again, we know it is the beautiful one that lies on the banks of the River Mersey.The fee for this article will be donated to the fundraiser set up for the victims of Monday’s incident in LiverpoolLiam Thorp is political editor at the Liverpool EchoDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Reading more about her life, the parallels between us became clearFri 30 May 2025 09.38 EDTLast modified on Fri 30 May 2025 21.30 EDTShareIgrew up as the daughter of an imam in a conservative British-Pakistani community inBradford. Our early years were spent in a large Victorian terrace owned by the local mosque council. When my father was replaced, we downsized overnight to a much smaller house on the other side of town. The loss of a beloved home, close friends and community was a deeply disorienting experience.Decades later, directing the new BBC seriesJane Austen: Rise of a Genius, I found myself thinking back to that time. On the surface, my life and Jane Austen’s couldn’t be more different – an English novelist born in the 18th century and a working-class British-Pakistani woman. Austen’s novels had always resonated with me when I read them as a girl. But learning moreabout her life as part of my director’s prep, I realised just how many shared realities we had. I saw how similar Austen’s family dynamics were to my own a couple of centuries down the line. When Austen’s father stepped away from his post as a clergyman, it forced the family to leave their genteel rectory home for a series of ever more insecure living quarters. Though separated by culture, time and geography, like Austen I understood early the brutality of economics and just how vulnerable a family can become when its financial foundation is shaken.Devouring Austen’s work as a teenager, I appreciated not just the storytelling but the survival tactics – strategies women used to maintain their dignity in a world that offered them very little agency. Growing up as a young woman from a Muslim background, I sometimes lived in the shadows, within the quiet restrictions and expectations of duty. I wanted to scream my rage into the abyss as I gingerly walked a tightrope between obedience and self-determination.Reading those novels, it wasn’t the ballrooms and the bonnets that spoke to me, but the stakes. They captured the emotional cost of a world in which women had limited options and where marriage was more often an economic contract than a love story. This was something I had seen first-hand in many of thearranged marriages of the women around me.Though my father, like Austen’s, passionately advocated for women’s education, in our wider community education for girls was not widely encouraged. Teachers in my inner-city school were predominantly white, middle class and from posher postcodes. They assumed that as young Pakistani girls we would disappear into early marriages, and some didn’t bother to hide their low expectations. That condescension stung. It made me hungry to prove them wrong, and to challenge whenever I could.Austen taught me that the domestic sphere could be radical. Her characters weren’t obvious revolutionaries, but women who, through wit, tenacity and endurance, reshaped their own lives. My grandmother, widowed early, chose not to remarry, thereby ensuring her autonomy. It was a rare and courageous decision in her 1960s rural Kashmiri village. The memory of my grandmother’s bold and brilliant choice lies in the very fabric of my DNA. Austen’s cousin Eliza was also a woman who instinctively understood the power her widowhood afforded her to live by her own rules. It was an important lesson in how an intelligent woman with her wits about her could cleverly navigate and confound societal expectations. A lesson not lost on a youngJane Austen.Like Austen, I too have a large brood of siblings, and our home was noisy and full of stories. We couldn’t afford expensive outings, but my father’s bookcases groaned under the weight of his book collection: dusty encyclopedias, Islamic jurisprudence and Urdu translations of Rumi. I knew books were the portal to other worlds, other possibilities, and Iread everything.Storytelling became an early refuge. I made my siblings act in hastily put together skits, all filmed on a clunky VHS recorder my parents could hardly afford, but which, like Austen’s writing desk, was a crucial gift. Even then I was crafting scenes, directing chaos into meaning.Coming back to Austen’s work as a film-maker, I saw what I hadn’t as a teenager: the sharpness of her observations, her critiques of social climbing and conformity, the feminist undertones, the devastating awareness of how class, gender and power intertwine. As I dug deeper into Austen’s life, I began to understand more why her work had struck such a chord with me as a teenager. While she wrote about women with seemingly limited options, it was always with a great deal of wry wit and a sense of hopefulness. I found inspiration in Austen’s humour, and to this day my sisters and I still refer to our mum as Mrs Bennet in a nod to her impassioned pleas for us not to dismiss potential suitors.Most importantly, Austen left behind stories of female protagonists struggling with daily compromises to survive that still resonate with women today. The idea that it is possible to live truthfully. In Persuasion, Anne Elliot finds the strength to choose for herself after years of silence. That journey hit close to home. I didn’t follow the expected path. I delayed marriage. I pursued education and entered a competitive, creative field where people like me were rarely seen. Telling Austen’s story has felt deeply personal. It is a reclamation of the girl who once sat in her bedroom window reading Emma while the sound of Friday prayers echoed in the background. A tribute to her voice and my own hard-fought one.Austen’s power, quiet but enduring, transcends time and cultural identity. Marking her 250th birthday isn’t just about remembering a literary icon, but about recognising that across the centuries, some battles remain the same. And if that’s not something a girl from Bradford can relate to, I don’t know what is.Ali Naushahi is a TV director and writerDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Or, to be more accurate, talking at them. The dead tend not to say much in reply. I haven’t been seeing a medium. I find myself startingconversations with my mum. Mostly the ones we never had or never finished. Not just the ones that her Alzheimer’s prevented us from having but the ones that were too difficult for us to have when she was not anxious, disturbed or confused.I’m not religious and I don’t believe in life after death, but I would like to know that all was well between us. That we had said enough to one another to last an eternity, as her ashes lie next to my dad in a churchyard with breathtaking views of the South Downs. That she is now free of her illness and everything that troubled her.Mum’s deathhas, bizarrely, brought my dad back to life. He has been dead for more than 25 years but I now chat to him regularly. Regretting that he has missed the best of me and my children. Regretting that he could never tell me about his experiences serving in the navy during the second world war. I often asked him while he was alive but he could never speak about it.The death count continues to rise. Today I learned that another good friend had died in his sleep. Barry could be stubborn, self-destructive and infuriating but he was also one of the warmest, most generous, talented and funny men you could meet. On holidays with him, he would without fail wait until the halfway point before declaring we had now “broken the back of it”. That never failed to crack me up. My kind of guy. Now he really has broken the back of it and I miss him. I will add him to my list of the talking dead.I also regularly chat to Herbie. Less so about the great existential questions and more about how I navigate my life on a daily basis. What to do, when to do it. Just like I used to do when he was alive. I trusted him and he trusted me. And oddly, he’s the only one of the dead who ever talks back to me.In dogs I find salvation.TuesdayIt’s recess in parliament, so Westminster has been relatively quiet. Just a few low-key announcements from government ministers to keep the news cycle happy but nothing of any great importance. The only politician to attempt to break the silence has been Nigel Farage, who held a press conference today. He stillhasn’t got the hang of being an MP. He was away on holiday in France last week when parliament was still sitting, so he had nothing to say on thetrade deal with the EU. Or perhaps he planned it that way. Nige knows better than anyone that most people now reckon Brexit has been at best a disappointment, so he is keen not to draw any attention to it.Anyway, Farage is back and keen to suck up some airtime. Normally, Nige has nothing to say except telling everyone how well Reform is going while pinning the blame for everything that is wrong with the country onimmigrants and wokery. This time, he actually tried to make a speech that wasn’t about foreigners but about wider Reform policy. And it could just have been thebiggest miscalculation Farage has madein his political career. Here’s hoping.Nige thought he was trying to appeal to Labour voters by promising anend to the two-child benefit capand increasing the threshold for basic-rate income tax to £20,000. What he was really doing was making tax cuts and spending promises that totalled between £50bn and £80bn. And when he was asked by journalists how he was going to pay for this, Nige got predictably tetchy. He would tell us all in a year or so. Once he had worked it out on the back of his fag packet. But it would involve efficiency savings and reversing net “stupid” zero. As the half-witted Dicky Tice likes to call the climate crisis policy. This was suicidal economics on a scale that madeLiz Truss look almost sane. The emperor had just revealed himself. And he was wearing no clothes.View image in fullscreenDigested photo of the week – Keir Starmer: ‘Farage is only this big on the TV.’Photograph: James Speakman/PAWednesdayIt was probably the most Spursy finish to a season in the club’s history. First,victory over Manchester Unitedin Bilbao. Afirst European trophyin more than 40 years. A first trophy of any description in 17 years. For some fans, that alone is enough for all to be forgiven. Last-gasp redemption. A season to remember. The end justifies everything. A final to be remembered and treasured. Even if the match itself was instantly forgettable. Two mediocre teams chasing the ball while having forgotten what to do with it. Just that Spurs were slightly less poor than United on the night.The single goal that decided the final was worthy of the game. A scrappy affair. Uefa credited the goal to Brennan Johnson, even though he didn’t seem to get a lace to the ball. The decisive last touch appeared to come off the United defender Luke Shaw for an own goal. The only moment of quality was the remarkable goalline clearance by Spurs’ Micky van de Ven.Still, glory is glory, and some fans are still celebrating. Bank the win etc. For others, me included, the enjoyment is tinged with scepticism. The season ended much as it had played out: with yet another home defeat in the Premier League. More a capitulation than a loss. A4-1 defeat to a Brighton sidethat had come to play football. We had come to while away 90 minutes before resuming the Europa League celebrations, at the same time cementing a 17th-place finish. One above the relegation zone and four points adrift of 16th.The data showed that Spurs fans hadpaid more than fans of every other clubto watch their side lose last season. There again, it’s not the losing I mind. I quite enjoyed ourrelegation year in 1977. It’s been the sense that no one but me was that bothered by our league form. I want my support not to be taken for granted. I want changes. A new manager. Time to say thanks but no thanks toAnge Postecoglou. It turned out the only club he knew how to beat was Manchester United, which he did four times. If only he could have worked out how to beat Ipswich and Leicester. We need new players. Ones with the ability to solve problems mid-game that the manager can’t. Above all, I don’t want to have to wait another 17 years for another trophy. Imight not have that long.ThursdayYou should never overestimate the intelligence of the very rich. In Thailand there is a new fashion among the super-wealthy foracquiring lion cubs as pets. Unfortunately, it doesn’t seem to have occurred to this brain-dead elite that lion cubs grow into adult lions, and that adult lions can’t necessarily be trusted around the house. You can’t sit them down in front of the TV all day, because before long they have switched channels toDavid Attenborough documentariesand are watching their relations tearing wildebeest apart in the Maasai Mara. And that kind of thing gives them ideas, and before you know it they are making themselves sandwiches from the remains of humans. So there comes a moment when the pet owners have the stunning revelation that maybe it wasn’t a great idea to try to house-train a lion and they want to offload their miserable pets to a zoo. Or to someone even more half-witted than they are. Imagine the thought processes involved. Assuming there are any.We’ll draw the line at a pet hippo because that’s obviously not going to work – it won’t fit in the bath – but a lion will make the perfect addition to family life. It can spend the afternoons in the crabapple tree and help itself to the neighbour’s pet rabbit. What happened to thinking of what the animal needs rather than just your own narcissistic desires?We find ourselves petless for the first time in more than 40 years and the house feels empty. I miss Herbie terribly. He should be sitting next to me as I write. As it is, I only have his paw print for company. People ask if we are going to get another dog but it is just too soon to think about that. The queen may have had10 days of mourningbut Herbie deserves at least 10 months. Weirdly, I did have a dream in which a new dog featured. He was brown and white and had Herbie’s blessing. Maybe next year.View image in fullscreenDigested photo of the week 2 – David Lammy to his Norwegian counterpart, Espen Barth Eide: ‘I guess you don’t have a problem with small boat crossings.’Photograph: Stefan Rousseau/PAFridayTime to announce the halfwit of the week. Step forward Robert Jenrick, the shadow justice secretary and tireless campaigner to remove Kemi Badenoch as leader of the Tory party and replace her with himself. AKA Pratman. While all of his shadow cabinet colleagues were spending recess doing nothing except firing off the odd press statement to which no one paid any attention, Honest Bob put on his black and grey hooded one-piece to turn himself into aone-man vigilante on the London tube.Along with his very own Robin, who was there to film him, our caped crusader went to Stratford station to confront fare-dodgers and restore law and order to the capital’s streets. Despite haranguing a few people, he didn’t appear to make any citizen’s arrests. Transport for London appeared unimpressed, pointing out that Pratman had broken laws of his own by filming on the tube network. But Honest Bob was undeterred.In next week’s instalment, he hopes to tackle the city’s crime wave by apprehending shoplifters and anyone caught working in a Turkish barber shop. Perhaps he might like to investigate a cold case rather closer to home.In 2020, a young Conservative housing minister was caught rushing through planning permission to the former pornographer Richard Desmondin order to save him a large tax bill. Even though the local council and departmental officials had recommended the permission be refused. Dirty Des was so thrilled with the junior minister that he made a donation to the Tory party. However, the planning permission was eventually rescinded after it was deemed to be “unlawful because of apparent bias”. So who was this housing minister? None other than Pratman himself. Honest Bob. He wants to bang up offenders for dodging a £4.60 fare. But Tory donors are free to escape a £40m tax demand.Explore more on these topicsPoliticsDigested weekcommentShareReuse this content"

That time, the grown-ups said no. The reasons given were costs – estimates ran to$92m–hellish logistics, and the Washington DC mayor Muriel Bowser’s worries that tanks and other armored vehicles would tear up Washington’s streets.Someretired generalsobjected publicly to the totalitarian-adjacent optics, especially given the US president’s praise for such bad actors asSaddam HusseinandVladimir Putin. Several Republican lawmakers also expressed their distaste. “Confidence is silent, and insecurity is loud,” the Louisiana senator John Kennedy toldMSNBC. “America is the most powerful country in all of human history ... and we don’t need to show it off. We’re not North Korea. We’re not Russia, we’re not China,” he continued, “and I don’t wanna be.”This time, as Washington prepares for a huge military shindig on 14 June, Trump’s 79th – and, oh yes, the US army’s 250th – birthday, the generals are silent. TheRepublicanshave sworn allegiance to the king. And the media are focused on the price tag, the potholes and the impending pomp; on tensions between the blue city of Washington and the red capital; and on the decimation of veterans’ healthcare, housing, and pensions while the administration throws $25m to $45m at a circus of war.All are important parts of the story. Yet commentary is muted and the debate mischaracterized as normal political discourse. The horrific point is missed: the spectacle of a massive show of military might, before a president who behaves like a dictator and views the armed forces as his personal foot soldiers, evinces memories of the worst totalitarian regimes. History may mark 14 June 2025 as the ceremonial birth of a new American fascism.It’s been a big, beautiful week of bad news for Trump. But don’t expect it to stick | Zoe WilliamsRead moreMilitary Parade in Capital on Trump’s Birthday Could Cost $45 Million, Officials Say, reported theNew York Timesin mid-May.CBSalso led with the cost. TheWashingtoniandescribed in detail the street-damage-preventive measures the army is installing: metal plates under the parade route, rubber padding on the tank treads – though transportation experts warn that running, at last count, 28 Abrams tanks, 28 Bradley fighting vehicles, 28 Strykers, and four Paladins, each behemoth weighing as much as70 tonnes, could buckle the asphalt and smash power, water and telecom lines underneath.Even theNew Republic, the president’s daily disparager, put the cost up top, tallied the ordinance, and noted that the man who “signed an executive order creating a program to ‘beautify Washington DC’” was now “plotting to transform his expensive birthday party into a demolition derby that will cause serious damage to the roads that line the nation’s capital”.In late May, three weeks after theAssociated Pressfirst revealed the parade plan, the army promised it would pay to fix the streets. It did not commit to picking up the multimillion-dollar tab for policing and cleanup, however, which will come out of a city budget from which the House cut$1.1bnin March and didn’t get around to restoring.Still, the partial resolution of the infrastructure problems liberated the press to get on with the fun stuff: “what to expect” on the festive day: not just planes, tanks and 6,700 soldiers, but also fireworks, football players and fitness competitions.USA Todaylinked to the free tickets page and published the parade route, plus a map of the military goodies on display, including robots and night-vision goggles. It called the event an “unofficial birthday party”.ABC Newsran a feature on Doc Holliday, the dog who will join the parade in a mule-drawn cart.Tucked into some stories was a sentence or two indicating controversy, such as this fromReuters: “Critics have called a parade an authoritarian display of power that is wasteful, especially as Trump slashes costs throughout the federal government.”“The plans have drawn some criticism from Democrats,” saidCBS.The Hillwrote: “Democrats and critics have questioned both the cost of the parade and whether it politicizes the military, which has traditionally been nonpartisan. The fact that the parade falls on Trump’s birthday has only fueled criticism from Democrats who view it as a way for the president to celebrate himself.”Over at Fox, they were telling the critics to get over themselves. “The Democratic party, they’ve chosen to be an outrage machine at a time when there is outrage fatigue in this country,”scoffed Kayleigh McEnany, Trump’s former press secretary and current Fox News host. “People are fed up with the ‘authoritarianism coup’ language.”It’s true. Only one party is complaining. But what is striking about their complaints is the relative dearth of authoritarian coup language. “The egotist-in-chief wants taxpayers to foot the bill for a military parade on his birthday,” saidSteve Cohen, a US representative from Tennessee, in a statement. As if the president were moved by mere narcissism.ReportedForbeson 15 May: “There has been no formal pushback to the proposal.”Trump likes hulking lethal toys, but he hasn’t always been partial to the people who run them. There was thefighthe picked with a couple of Muslim Gold Star parents during his first campaign; thecommentson a 2018 European trip that fallen soldiers are “losers” and “suckers”; the undisguisedqueasinessabout seeing or being seen with wounded veterans; the Pentagon session where he called his top officers“a bunch of dopes and babies”.But he is warming to the role of commander in chief. In hiscommencement speechat West Point, between bloviations on Nato, drag shows, golf and trophy wives, he boasted about the unprecedented $1.1tn military budget. “You’ll become officers in the greatest and most powerful army the world has ever known,” he said. “And I know because I rebuilt that army, and I rebuilt the military ... like nobody has ever rebuilt it before.”Will Donald Trump defy the US supreme court? | Steven GreenhouseRead moreAlso breaking from script onMemorial Dayat Arlington Cemetery, he suggested that the parade, on top of nabbing the World Cup and the Olympics, was divinely ordained. “Look what I have, I have everything,” he cried. “Amazing the way things work out. God did that.”If he is to ease from commander of the armed forces to commander of everything, he will need more than God on his side. He’ll need to own the military. Forty-five million bucks is a good starting bid.Stalin’s 50th birthday celebration, in 1929, is considered the kickoff of his cult of personality. Hitler’s 50th birthday military parade, in April 1939, was organized by the propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels for maximum grandeur, including a motorcade of 50 white limousines. Five months later, Germany invaded Poland.Kim Jong-unchanged Loyalty Oath Day from 1 January to his birthday, 8 January. This February, the Republican US representative Claudia Tenney of New York introduced abillto designate Trump’s birthday as a national holiday. It hasn’t gone anywhere – yet.The pieces are lining up like a phalanx of soldiers. The website of America250, the non-profit fundraising and marketing arm of the Semiquincentennial Commission, is an advertisement for Trump. Its description of the “grand military parade” refers to him in the second sentence andproclaimsthat under his “leadership, the U.S. Army has been restored to strength and readiness”.At the parade, the crowd of200,000spectators will be dominated by Maga idol worshippers.

But the chaos is also, as it was for Boris Johnson, a means of defence.Since he makes zero pretence of professionalism, it’s somehow less expected of him, enabling him to slip past the standards applied to others. Rival parties often avoid attacking him, for fear of reminding voters he exists. Even now Reform UK hasopened a substantial poll leadover Labour, treating this ramshackle outfit as a potential party of government still feels faintly ridiculous. Prime Minister Farage? Are youserious? But he is. And it’s time the country was too.The Farage whoparked his tankson Labour’s lawn this week, promising to scrap the two-child limit on some benefits and restore pensioners’ winter fuel payment, was familiar in many ways yet somehow sharper round the edges. Imagine a picture, clicking into focus. His critique of a prime minister lacking “any great feeling, meaning or passion for the job” was laser-targeted on Labour supporters increasingly confused about what Keir Starmer actually stands for. No wonder Starmer wasstung into responding, denouncing his wildly unfunded promises of free money as “Liz Truss all over again”. But they won’t really mind that at Reform HQ: to be attacked that directly helps entrench the idea that their tiny motley crew, not the Tories, is the opposition now.Farage is by far the most experienced party leader in British politics, and not coincidentally the boldest. He doesn’t need focus groups to tell him what “his” people think – he knows exactly who they are, what they want, who they hate – and the long slow march to Brexit taught him that over time they can warm to ideas they’d once have rejected. So where Labour seems to live anxiously within the limits of what the public will currently accept, he’s one step ahead, thinking about how far they could be persuaded to go.When Starmer hesitated over scrapping a two-child cap that remains popular with the public, Farage didn’t. Since he’s not in government, the £3.5bn price tag isn’t his problem, and by embracing the idea he can take the credit with parents if it happens while leaving Labour to foot the bill. Meanwhile he’s gambling that Reform voters would trade a bigger welfare bill for the prospect of families being encouraged to have more children, thus reducing the need for immigration. You can loathe everything about that logic and still wonder why Labour can’t seem to find popular (though in a more benign sense) ways to sell contentious ideas. Might it ultimately take a dash of leftwing populism to beat the rightwing kind? (Apparently, in focus groups the one left politician who seemingly excites Reform voters is Bernie Sanders, raging against an economy he considers rigged against the working classes.)But for all its strengths, that Farage speech also exposed the weaknesses of a party on an impossibly steep learning curve. Reform’s predecessors were one-issue parties, designed to force bigger parties to act but not to run things themselves. There is a vast chasm between that and providing a full-spectrum opposition-into-government service via just five novice MPs and a back office operation with no real policy expertise.He’ll make mistakes, get things wrong. In Tuesday’s speech, the normally blokeish Farage pitched hard for conservative women’s votes, talking about ways of making life easier for new parents. But vague, old-fashioned musings about creches in the workplace are a giveaway that he isn’t talking to anyone who actually understands how modern childcare works, and Reform is similarly vague about a vast swathe of issues on which a credible opposition needs to know its onions.Look atits manifesto. No, really: look at it, because it was apparently written on the assumption nobody would. Their 2029 prospectus will surely be slicker, but for now this document drafted on the back of a metaphorical fag packet for the 2024 snap election is Reform’s only available vision for government.Obviously the maths is bonkers: a staggering £90bn of tax cuts, theInstitute for Fiscal Studies reckoned– abolishing inheritance tax, slashing business taxes, “simplifying” others – plus £50bn of extra spending, implausibly funded by binning net zero (though that’s mainly private sector investment, not taxpayers’ money), abolishing “waste” and various other cuts that don’t add up. Liz Truss again, but on steroids.The rest is a combination of wildly sweeping promises – completely eradicating NHS waiting lists for the first time in the NHS’s history, or simply returning all small boat arrivals to France with no obvious thought for how the French might respond – and weirdly specific micro-policies, including a public inquiry on vaccine harms presumably added to mollify anti-vaxxers, and a bizarre rule that any school lesson on British or European slavery be matched with one on non-European use of slavery.As the former Conservative special adviser Sam Freedmanpoints outon hisSubstack, it also implies a government worryingly averse to challenge. Reform would scrap the BBC licence fee, essentially killing public service broadcasting; politicise senior civil service appointments; and leave the European convention on human rights. Few checks and balances would survive a Prime Minister Farage, and the hard lesson from across the Atlantic is that constitutional experts should be thinking urgently now about how to pre-emptively shore them up.If Trump voters are any guide, many Farage voters are past caring about any of that. They already assume most politicians lie, so they don’t really expect his promises to stack up, and they’re strongly motivated to punish other parties they think have failed them. It’s progressive voters who are potentially most sensitive to messages about the risks of Prime Minister Farage, judging byYouGov’s findingthat given a choice between the Reform leader and either Starmer, Ed Davey or Kemi Badenoch, Anyone-but-Farage enters Downing Street every time. Beloved by his own supporters but uniting everyone else’s against him, for now Farage looks more Marine Le Pen than Donald Trump, a populist kept at bay by mass tactical voting for as long as progressives can bury their differences.But it’s an uncomfortable way to run a democracy: like a political equivalent of lockdown, it’s a means of temporarily quarantining populism rather than a cure, and if maintained for too long it ultimately risks an explosion. Things don’t get more serious than that.Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsNigel FarageOpinionReform UKcommentShareReuse this content"

What has caused this long and slow awakening? Is it Israel’s killing of more than 54,000 Palestinians since Hamas’s horrific attack on 7 October 2023? Thousands of babiesat risk of dyingfrom starvation and malnutrition? Civiliansburning alive? Israeli ministers’ plans to reoccupy and recolonise the Gaza Strip,expelling Palestinians? Or perhaps it’s the Israeli armyfiring shots at diplomats, including Europeans, in the West Bank – or theracist chanting, during a state-funded march in Jerusalem, of “death to the Arabs” and “may their villages burn”?It’s probably a combination of all the above, as well as the recognition that principled pressure on Israel will certainly not come from Washington. Whatever the triggers for it,Europemay be nearing an inflection point on the graph, turning the dark page of its complicity with Israel’s nearly 20-month war in Gaza.A minority of European countries has made a principled stand over the war. EU members Spain, Ireland and Slovenia, as well as Norway outside the bloc, recognised Palestine as a sovereign state last year, fully supported the proceedings and decisions of the international court of justice and the international criminal court, continued funding Unrwa, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, and voted in favour of all UN general assembly resolutions on Gaza.However, there is also a minority of countries that has continued to offer unabashed support for Benjamin Netanyahu’s government. The most unrepentant are the Czech Republic and Hungary, with Germany and Italy next in line. Hungary’s prime minister, Viktor Orbán, went as far asinvitingNetanyahu to Budapest, despite the international criminal court’s arrest warrant. Hungary thenleft the ICCaltogether.Most other European countries have sat silently in the middle. For the first six months of the war, this meant refusing to call for a ceasefire. Only in the spring of 2024, when even Joe Biden’s rabidly pro-Israel administrationchanged tack, did the EU join the chorus in favour of a truce.European governments and EU institutions have mildly pushed back against Donald Trump’s monstrousGaza “riviera” proposaland embraced theArab recovery and reconstruction plan. But they have continued to cooperate with Israel, going as far as holding an EU-Israel Association Council meeting in February that was chaired by the EU high representative, Kaja Kallas, and the Israeli foreign minister, Gideon Sa’ar. At most, they have lightly slapped Israel on the wrist for its disproportionate and indiscriminate violence in the strip.Now, though, the silent majority is shifting. The UK hassuspended negotiationson a bilateral free trade agreement with Israel. Pausing that negotiation inflicts no cost on Israel, since no agreement yet exists. But it’s symbolically important.France is louder and more active, not simply in its diplomatic pursuit of a two-state solution, but also in hinting at the possibility oftargeted sanctionson Israel. So far, these are baby steps, mostly abstract and/or tentative. But they indicate a change of pace and heart.Potentially most meaningful is the move within the EU tosuspend its preferential trade arrangementswith Israel under the EU-Israel association agreement. To be clear, suspending preferential trade would not constitute a sanction. Sanctions, implying import bans or restrictions, require unanimous agreement in the EU, and it’s hard to imagine all 27 EU governments ever agreeing to that. Suspension of the entire EU-Israel association agreement is also hard to imagine, since this would also require unanimity.But suspending preferential trade means withholding a benefit of theassociation agreement and this falls within the remit of EU trade policy, which only requires a qualified majority of EU states voting in favour.Trade between the EU and Israel would continue,just not on preferential terms as has been the case since the association agreement came into force in 2000.While considered unthinkable in the past, there is now a real possibility that this process could move forward. For the time being, Kallas has mandated a review of Israel’s compliance with its obligations under the association agreement. Interestingly, the review was formally requested not by a pro-Palestinian member state such as Spain or Ireland, or even by France, butby a traditionally pro-Israel one, the Netherlands, led by a rightwing government.Considering that human rights and respect for international law are legally “essential elements” of the EU-Israel agreement (article 2), it would be egregious if the review, which will report on Israel’s documented war crimes, were ignored and did not trigger a proposal by the European Commission for a suspension.The qualified majority necessary to suspend the trade section of the agreement would require15 out of 27 statesto support the move. Seventeen countries backed the review. But a qualified majority also requires the agreement of member states representing 65% of the EU population. If Germany and Italy opposed the move, that population threshold would not be met. Either one or the other wouldneed to budge.At the moment, Italy’s far-right government, led by Giorgia Meloni, has given no indication of a change of policy. Criticism of Israel is growing, but not to the point of triggering a policy shift.German governments have long regarded Israel’s security as aStaatsräsonfor Germany given its history. This means it is near impossible to criticise Israel’s war in Gaza. But opinions about that may finally be shifting. The chancellor, Friedrich Merz, declared this week that Israel’s actions in Gaza couldno longer be justified– and that he could no longer understand Israel’s goals in the strip.Actually, Israel’s goals have been made abundantly clear, by the words of the Israeli government and, even more so, by its deeds. This is a war that has much to do with reoccupation, recolonisation and mass expulsion, and very little to do with Israeli security and the release of hostages. Even the staunchest of Israel’s supporters, such as Merz, are becoming hard-pressed to deny this, and therefore less able to condone and support it.The suspension of the EU-Israel association agreement’s preferential trade provisions may not stop the war in Gaza overnight. But it would be the first concrete step by the international community to exact a price on Israel for its crimes. Ultimately, imposing such costs is the only way to bring about change.The EU is Israel’sbiggest trading partner, so the cost in question is not insignificant. Acting now will not bring back tens of thousands of lives in the Gaza Strip. These will remain for ever a stain on our collective conscience. But it would reduce the bleak prospect of a future with only more death and destruction in store.Nathalie Tocci is a Guardian Europe columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Or risk losing voters to a broken settlementEditorialSir Keir Starmer may want to reassure markets, but neglecting everyday hardship risks alienating an insecure electorate that looks elsewhereFri 30 May 2025 12.54 EDTLast modified on Fri 30 May 2025 13.36 EDTShareThe Conservative party may besliding into the abyss, as Sir Keir Starmer suggests, but Labour would be foolish to imagine that it is insulated from the same fate. Labour’s pollingplummetsince the 2024 general election is the worst for any government since 1983. In cutting current spending on benefits while promising future capital investment, Sir Keir risks alienating the very voters he needs to keep.Thefoundationsof Britain’s two-party system are eroding. The Liberal Democrats, Reform UK, the Greens and nationalist parties in Scotland and Wales are looking to gain. Some say the Toriesnow face an existential crisislike the one that saw the Liberals overtaken by Labour in the 1920s. That split happened on the left. The Conservatives should not be surprised to see it repeated on the right – with Reform poised to usurp them.Margaret Thatcherthoughtthe Labour party would never die. Her logic was that the trade unions wouldn’t let it. But that support is weaker and has been radically reshaped. White-collar trade unions – composed of teachers, academics, doctors – appear culturally middle class but are economically working class: facing insecure contracts and less workplace power. They are joined by a precariat of renters and gig workers, as well as groups, such as disabled people, who struggle to get by.TheJoseph Rowntree Foundationpoints to a critical electoral group: the economically insecure, especially those aged 35 to 59. Many own homes, work in professional sectors and vote irregularly. Their financial position is increasingly fragile. They are more likely to switch parties and to resent a politics that ignores their daily stress. Labour risks misreading them.Labour’s answer is restrictive fiscal rules, welfare cuts and promises of £100bn in capital investment. To many voters, this looks just looks like pain today. The chancellor should realise that celebrating rule changes to theTreasury’s green bookwon’t compensate for real-terms service cuts. At its core, Labour’s offer often sounds like an improved version of the status quo, not a challenge to it. But the post-1980s consensus – in home ownership, pensions, higher education, labour markets – is no longer delivering. What people increasingly experience is not the dream they were promised but its unravelling. Home ownership has stalled, with rising numbers of olderrenters.Regionswith the most graduate growth have seen the steepest falls in graduate-level work. “Flexibility” often means vulnerability.Meanwhile, the Conservatives’ traditional coalition has fractured. Since the 1980s, successive rightwing governments cultivated aself-employedbase – typically including small-business owners and tradespeople – which resisted redistribution and resented regulation. What unites them isn’t their wage level, but a politics of national sovereignty, community betrayal and individual success. Tapping into these anxieties explains Nigel Farage’s appeal.Labour cannotout-Reform Reform, just as Mr Farage cannotplausiblyout-Labour Labour. How parties frame class shapes whether class drives voting. Sir Keir must speak to voters rather than addressing bond vigilantes. Markets fear government disorder, notfiscal deficits. The refusal toscrapthe two-child benefit cap is not just a moral failure. It signals indifference to the daily pressures voters face.Sir Keir may draw sharper lines with Reform than with theConservatives. But if he offers no alternative to a failing settlement – no vision of work, welfare or home that speaks to how people live now – he may find the public looks elsewhere for one.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

But art critics have unanimously awarded itfive stars. From Saturday, visitors to theV&A East Storehousein the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park will be able to wander among the 250,000 objects in theVictoria and Albert Museum’s collection that are not on display in its west London home. The headline-grabbingorder-an-objectinitiative means you can book online to get your hands (gloves are provided) on a priceless artefact any day you like. And all for free.It is a triumph born out of necessity. After the V&A’s eviction from their Kensington storage home a decade ago, they decided that instead of hiding one of the world’s largest design collections in an expensive warehouse, they would turn it into an attraction in its own right. Storage is a big issue for institutions: only1%of the British Museum’s more than 8m artefacts are on public display. Showing off your overflowing attic makes the most of what you’ve already got, repurposing a closet that, for the V&A, includes aBalenciaga gown(the most requested item so far) andPJ Harvey’s hotpants.Open-access storage is not a new idea. In 2021, theDepot Boijmans Van Beuningen in Rotterdambecame the first purpose-built (and presumably the only Ikea-salad bowl-inspired) public art-storage destination. The V&A Storehouse takes a leap further. You are invited behind the scenes of the museum, where everything is jumbled together and conservators are at work – a giant version of the BBC’sThe Repair Shop. Like the children who run away to New York’s Metropolitan Museum for a week in EL Konigsburg’s classic 1967 novelFrom the Mixed-Up Files of Mrs Basil E Frankweiler, visitors are able to explore freely. “We wanted people to feel like they’re trespassing,”saidTim Reeve, the deputy director of the V&A. “That feeling of joy, seeing behind the curtain.”Part of the V&A’s mission was to inspire innovation, to be a bit radical. Ordering an object is a user-friendly way of engaging newcomers, not just a click-and-collect for art lovers. Like Sadler’s Wells, which also launched aStratford venueearlier this year, the V&A hopes to draw in a younger audience who may have felt excluded from its stately South Kensington home. A sisterV&A East Museumwill open close to the Storehouse next year.Putting everything on show cannot get over uncomfortable questions about the provenance of a museum’s acquisitions. But it does give transparency to how the museum works and what – down to every last pin – it has got.This week,Manchester Museumwon theEuropean museum of the year awardfor its own approach to opening up the curatorial process. As part of itsrevampin 2023, the museum handed its new South Asia gallery to a collective of 30 people from Manchester’s diaspora communities to design and fill as they chose. The top floor has been given over to acollege for neurodivergent students, with a London campus opening at theDesign Museumin September.The pandemic, as well as funding and sponsorship crises and anxieties over legacy, have put institutions under pressure. Both the V&A East Storehouse andManchesterMuseum show bold new ways forward. They mark a shift in how museums perceive their role. They remind us that these collections are our collections. Fill your basket.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Lawyers for the broadcaster defended the documentary and said the libel action was a cynical attempt to launder Adams’s reputation.The former West Belfast MP said a BBC Spotlight documentary and accompanying online article defamed him in 2016 by claiming he had sanctioned the murder ofDenis Donaldson, a former Sinn Féin official who was shot dead in County Donegal months after admitting he had for decades been a police and MI5 informant. The claim about Adams was made by an anonymous source known only as “Martin”.Adams’s lawyers accused the BBC of “reckless journalism” and of making an “unjustified” attack on a man credited with helping to bring about the peace process that drew a line under the Troubles in 1998.The BBC said it acted in good faith and that the claim was presented as an allegation and not as a fact and had been corroborated by five other sources, including the security services. Lawyers for the broadcaster argued that because Adams was widely considered to have been an IRA commander during the Troubles he had little reputation to lose and that any damages would be a “cruel joke”.Speaking outside the court, Adams said: “From my perspective, taking this case was about putting manners on the British Broadcasting Corporation. I know many, many journalists. I like to think that I get on well with the most of them, and I wish you well, and I would uphold your right to do your job.“But the British Broadcasting Corporation upholds the ethos of the British state inIreland, and in my view it’s out of sync in many, many fronts with the Good Friday agreement. It hasn’t caught on to where we are on this island as part of the process, the continuing process, of building peace and justice, and harmony, and, hopefully, in the time ahead, unity.”Paul Tweed, a solicitor for Adams, said his client was very pleased at the verdict, which he said showed the BBC should not have included the disputed claim in its broadcast. “Not only had the false allegation regarding our client been the focus of the Spotlight documentary, but it had been utilised to sensationalise and publicise their programme,” said Tweed.“Furthermore, the fact that the false allegation has been left online for almost nine years has, in my opinion, done much to undermine the high standards of accuracy that is expected of the BBC. This case could and should have been resolved some considerable time ago.”Adams, 76, took centre stage in the witness box for much of the trial, which covered his childhood and political awakening, the evolution of the Troubles, theIRA’s deadly campaign and the peace process. He repeatedly denied ever being a member of the IRA. “It wasn’t a path that I took,” he said.Other witnesses included Jennifer O’Leary, the BBC reporter who made the documentary, and media experts who gave contrasting views on the programme and accompanying article. Litigation lawyers estimate the total cost of the trial could exceed several million euros.Before sending out the jury to begin deliberations on Thursday, Justice Alexander Owens said there was no need to decide on the veracity of the allegation that Adams sanctioned Donaldson’s murder, or to make a judgment on the republican leader’s role in Irish history.The judge instructed the jury of five men and seven women to consider whether the words in the documentary and article meant Adams had sanctioned the murder, or were presented only as an allegation, as the BBC had argued. The jury determined that the meaning of the words was that Adams had sanctioned the murder. It also found that the BBC had not acted in good faith and not proved its “fair publication” defence.The judge had told the jury that if it found in favour of Adams and awarded damages, it should assess the damages on the basis of Adams’s current and recent reputation.Adams was a teachta dála – a member of the Dáil – for Louth when the programme aired. He stepped down as president ofSinn Féinin 2018 after leading the party for 35 years.Adam Smyth, the director of BBCNorthern Ireland, expressed disappointment at the outcome. Speaking outside court, he said: “We are disappointed by this verdict. We believe we supplied extensive evidence to the court of the careful editorial processes and journalistic diligence applied to this programme, and to the accompanying online article. Moreover, it was accepted by the court and conceded by Gerry Adams’s legal team that the Spotlight broadcast and publication were of the highest public interest.“We didn’t want to come to court but it was important that we defend our journalism and we stand by that decision. Our past is difficult terrain for any jury and we thank them for their diligence and careful consideration of the issues in this case.”Explore more on these topicsGerry AdamsBBCIrelandEuropeNorthern IrelandDefamation lawMedia lawnewsShareReuse this content"

Dr Douglas Adkins, the study’s co-principal investigator and a professor of oncology, said the results were significant and notable because it was the first time such a drug had generated this effect.Researchers around the world tested the drug in patients with newly diagnosed locally advanced head and neck cancers. Hundreds of thousands of patients are diagnosed with these cancers globally each year.Of 714 patients in the trial, 363 received pembrolizumab followed by standard of care, and 351 received only the current standard of care – surgery to remove their tumour followed by radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy.Standard of care has not changed for these patients in more than 20 years, and more than half are unlikely to survive for five years.The immunotherapy worked particularly well for those with high levels of the immune marker PD-L1, but it increased dramatically the likelihood of patients with all types of head and neck cancers remaining well, without the disease progressing or returning.Kevin Harrington, a professor of biological cancer therapies at the Institute ofCancerResearch, London, led a UK team involved in the trial, which was funded by the pharmaceutical company MSD.“For patients with newly diagnosed, locally advanced head and neck cancer, treatments haven’t changed in over two decades,” he said. “Immunotherapy has been amazingly beneficial for patients with cancer that has come back or spread around the body but, until now, it hasn’t been as successful for those presenting for the first time with disease which has spread to nearby areas.“This research shows that immunotherapy could change the world for these patients – it significantly decreases the chance of cancer spreading around the body, at which point it is incredibly difficult to treat.“The results of this trial show that pembrolizumab dramatically increases the duration of disease remission for years longer than the current standard treatments. It works particularly well for those with high levels of immune markers, but it’s really exciting to see that the treatment improves outcomes for all head and neck cancer patients, regardless of these levels.”Laura Marston, 45, from Derbyshire, joined the trial after she was diagnosed with stage 4 tongue cancer in 2019. “I am amazed I am still here six years later,” she said. “This treatment has given me the gift of life.”Prof Kristian Helin, the chief executive of the Institute of Cancer Research, said: “Immunotherapy continues to deliver … To learn that patients with immunotherapy added to their treatment plan had, on average, double the length of time free from evidence of disease compared to those without it – with some patients still yet to see their cancer return – is wonderful.”Explore more on these topicsCancerHealthImmunologyMedical researchBiochemistry and molecular biologyBiologyChemistrynewsShareReuse this content"

He cited no evidence for either claim.Legal experts, including Eric Columbus, a former litigator for the January 6 select committee,suggestedTrump does not have the power to fire Sajet, since the gallery is part of the Smithsonian, which is not run by the executive branch.In its collection of portraits of American presidents, the gallery had this text about Trump: “Impeached twice, on charges of abuse of power and incitement of insurrection after supporters attacked the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, he was acquitted by the Senate in both trials. After losing to Joe Biden in 2020, Trump mounted a historic comeback in the 2024 election. He is the only president aside from Grover Cleveland (1837-1908) to have won a nonconsecutive second term.”Sajet arrived in the US with her family in 1997, held positions at the Philadelphia Museum of Art, the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, and the Historical Society of Pennsylvania andwas appointed directorof the National Portrait Gallery in 2013,according to a Guardian profile of her.‘It reminds you of a fascist state’: Smithsonian Institution braces for Trump rewrite of US historyRead moreThe National Portrait Gallery is an art museum in Washington DC that opened in 1968 and is part of theSmithsonian Institution.

However two of the court’s three liberal-leaning justices,Ketanji Brown JacksonandSonia Sotomayor, publicly dissented.The court “botched” its assessment of whether the administration was entitled to freeze Talwani’s decision pending the litigation, Jackson wrote in an accompanying opinion.The outcome, Jacksonwrote, “undervalues the devastating consequences of allowing the government to precipitously upend the lives and livelihoods of nearly half a million noncitizens while their legal claims are pending”.Jackson also said that “it is apparent that the government seeks a stay to enable it to inflict maximum pre-decision damage.”She added that those living under parole protections in this case now face “two unbearable options”.One option is to “elect to leave the United States and thereby, confront ‘dangers in their native countries,’ experience destructive ‘family separation’ and possibly ‘forfeit any opportunity to obtain a remedy based on their … claims”, Jackson wrote.The other option is that they could remain in the US after parole termination and “risk imminent removal at the hands of government agents, along with its serious attendant consequences”.To Jackson, “either choice creates significant problems for respondents that far exceed any harm to the government … At a minimum, granting the stay would facilitate needless human suffering before the courts have reached a final judgement regarding the legal arguments at issue, while denying the government’s application would not have anything close to the kind of practical impact.”Immigration parole is a form of temporary permission under American law to be in the country for “urgent humanitarian reasons or significant public benefit”, allowing recipients to live and work in the US. Biden, a Democrat, used parole as part of his administration’s approach to handling migrants entering at theUS-Mexico border.Such a status does not offer immigrants a long-term path towards citizenship but it can typically be renewed multiple times. A report from the American Immigration Councilfoundthat halting the program would, apart from the humanitarian effect, be a blow to the US economy, as households in the US where the breadwinners have temporary protected status (TPS) collectively earned more than $10bn in total income in 2021 while paying nearly $1.3bn in federal taxes.Trump called for ending humanitarian parole programs in an executive order signed on 20 January,his first day backin office. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) subsequently moved to terminate them in March, cutting short the two-year parole grants. The administration said revoking the parole status would make it easier to place migrants in a fast-track deportation process called “expedited removal”.The case is one of many that the Trump administration has brought in an emergency fashion to the nation’s highest judicial body seeking to undo decisions by judges impeding the president’ssweeping policies, includingseveral targetingimmigrants.Trump administration sets quota to arrest 3,000 people a day in anti-immigration agendaRead moreThe supreme court on 19 May also let Trump end TPS that had been granted under Biden to about 350,000 additional Venezuelans living in the United States, while that legal dispute plays out.Jackson was the only justice topublicly dissentthen, while House Democrats condemned the supreme court’s decision.In a bid to reduce unauthorized border crossings, Biden starting in 2022 offering limited extra pathways to come to the US legally, allowingVenezuelanswho entered the US by air to request a two-year parole if they passed security checks and had a US financial sponsor. Biden expanded that eligibility process to Cubans, Haitians and Nicaraguans in 2023 as his administration grappled with high levels of illegal immigration from those countries.The plaintiffs in this case, a group of migrants granted parole and Americans who serve as their sponsors, sued administration officials claiming they violated federal law governing the actions of government agencies.Talwani in April found that the law governing such parole did not allow for the program’s blanket termination, instead requiring a case-by-case review. The Boston-based first US circuit court of appeals declined to put the judge’s decision on hold and the government appealed.The justice department told the supreme court that Talwani’s order had upended “critical immigration policies that are carefully calibrated to deter illegal entry”, effectively “undoing democratically approved policies that featured heavily in the November election” that returned Trump to the presidency.The plaintiffs told the supreme court they would face grave harm if their parole is cut short given that the administration has indefinitely suspended processing their pending applications for asylum and other immigration relief.They said they would be separated from their families and immediately subject to expedited deportation “to the same despotic and unstable countries from which they fled, where many will face serious risks of danger, persecution and even death”.Speaking at the White House on Friday afternoon,Donald Trumppraised the decision, saying “a couple of hours ago we had a great decision from the supreme court that’s very important”.Reuters contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsUS immigrationUS supreme courtTrump administrationDonald TrumpVenezuelaCubaNicaraguanewsShareReuse this content"

There is nothing left for the whales to prey upon so they have moved on in search of prey elsewhere.”The company, based in the coastal village of Unionhall, had thrived for most of its 25 years, but only a few minke whales and small groups of dolphins now appeared in its search area, he said. “Over the last couple of years our trips have become totally disappointing. In this light I am truly sad to say we are closing down for good.”The announcement prompted a public outcry and a promise from the government to do more to protect fish stocks and marine biodiversity.“We have to introduce measures to protect this forage species – not just for whales, but for all the other fish stocks and wildlife that depend on it – to prevent the collapse of an entire food web,” Christopher O’Sullivan, the minister responsible for nature and biodiversity,told the Irish Examiner. He said he hoped Ireland would emulate UK curbs on sprat fishing, which were having a positive effect.Demand for fishmeal from fish farms has dramatically increased the fishing of sprats, a small, sardine-like fish that plays a crucial role in the maritime food chain.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

It’s like a farmer taking all the grass out of his fields and expecting his cows to thrive.”However, Gannon said he had invested in a new boat and still offered enthralling excursions, albeit with less wildlife. “Just today we saw three minke whales,” he said on Friday after a tour. “Compared to the numbers we had before it’s chalk and cheese, but we still have a beautiful coastline. With the right policies, the south of Cork and the west coast ofIrelandcould be the European capital of marine tourism.”His wife and company co-owner, Trish Gannon, said bookings remained strong. “I tell people we can guarantee absolutely nothing in terms of sightings and they’re still happy to go out.”Patrick Murphy, the chief executive of the Irish South and West Fish Producer’s Organisation, said warming waters appeared to be pushing sprat further west and north – where sprat catches have risen sharply – and this accounted for the dwindlingwhalesightings off Cork.“We are asking for a proper scientific assessment for this species, so a proper management policy can be developed to ensure the continued sustainability of this important fishery,” he said.Explore more on these topicsIrelandWhalesCetaceansMarine lifeFishingWildlifeEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

In Manitoba alone, wildfires have burned about 200,000 hectares already this year – already about three times the recent full-year average for the province.Canada wildfires: thousands in Manitoba ordered to evacuate as state of emergency declaredRead moreMore than 17,000 people are in the process of being airlifted out of wildfire zones by the Canadian military, some of which now have no safe overland roads connecting them to the rest of the country. Wab Kinew, the Manitoba premier,declareda province-wide state of emergency on Wednesday, and Saskatchewan’s premier, Scott Moe,declared the sameon Thursday.“This is the largest evacuation Manitoba will have seen in most people’s living memory,” Kinew said at a press conference. “For the first time, it’s not a fire in one region, we have fires in every region. That is a sign of a changing climate that we are going to have to adapt to.”First Nations in Saskatchewanhave been particularly affectedby the fires this week, with some entire communities evacuated and occasionally trapped by road closures due to unsafe conditions.Drone footagecirculated by CBC showed towering flames and burned homes and cabins in northern Saskatchewan on Wednesday. Wildfires arealso burning in Alberta’s oil countryand have disrupted production and forced evacuations there this week.View image in fullscreenPeople wear protective masks as the Roosevelt Island Tram crosses the East River while haze and smoke from the Canadian wildfires shroud the Manhattan skyline in New York City, on 7 June 2023.Photograph: Shannon Stapleton/ReutersSatellite images captured over the past two weeks showed extreme fire behavior,including pyrocumulus clouds, that until recent years has been a rare occurrence in northern Canada – especially in the early days of the annual fire season. These clouds signify an especially hot and intense fire, and can help transport smoke high into the atmosphere where it can then travel long distances.In advance of the wave of wildfire smoke, the US National Weather Service has issued air quality alerts for parts of Minnesota between Lake Superior and the Canadian border.Weather forecasts show smoke continuing to billow across the border into the United States over the coming days, which could notably worsen air quality further downstream in cities such as Chicago, Detroit and Washington DC. Air quality in the worst-affected cities across the midwest and mid-Atlantic regions could reach the “red” category, signifying an air quality index exceeding 150 and unhealthy conditions for all groups.Graph showing area burned by wildfires in Canada by yearA prolonged period of unusually warm and dry conditions helped to intensify this week’s fires, continuing a trend worsened by climate change. The fire seasons of 2023 and 2024 were the worst two years in Canadian history. In June 2023, wildfire smoke transported southward from Canada turned skies orange over New York City, briefly making its airthe most unhealthy of any city in the world.Trump’s mass federal cuts disrupt LA wildfire recovery: ‘It’s coming tumbling down’Read moreThe most recent assessments by Natural Resources Canada show that fire conditions arecurrently maxing out the scaleacross much of the regions where wildfires are now burning out of control. Government forecastersalso predictthat the fire seasons in the provinces of Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta and British Columbia will all continue to be “well above average” for the remainder of the spring and summer.The health effects of wildfire smoke is an increasingly urgent area of medical research. Astudy published this weekfound for the first time that exposure to the fine soot particles of wildfire smoke can have adverse effects on the heart and lungs for months after the smoke clears. Otherrecent studieshave found that wildfire smoke worsens the risk of stroke, negatively impacts brain function, and can even interfere with fertility treatments.The worrying truth emerging from these studies is that there appears to be no safe level ofexposure to wildfire smoke, which can be up to 10 times more toxic than the soot and smog of typical urban air pollution.New datasuggest that thousands of people now die each year from wildfire smoke in the US, creating billions of dollars of additional costs to the economy.Expertsrecommendwearing a fitted N95 or similar mask if you are exposed to wildfire smoke outdoors, and using a portableair filtration systemif you are indoors.Explore more on these topicsUS newsWildfiresCanadaHealthClimate crisisAmericasExtreme weatheranalysisShareReuse this content"

She’d heard about the tents being dumped and left behind. Her mother, she says, is “an amazing seamstress”, so Mason thought she might be able to use some of the material to make clothes.“I originally went to clean up with the idea to make my own jacket. But that’s when I realised the problem was bigger than we thought.”As festivalgoers at Creamfields packed up and left, Mason was dumbfounded by the numbers of tents strewn in the fields. Growing up, borrowing kit had been the norm for camping and festivals because the gear was expensive; Mason had always felt a duty of care to the equipment she was bringing. “It was just a rule that unless your tent got set on fire, you packed it up dry and took it home.”But at Creamfields about 80% of the tents had been left behind, to be bulldozed and sent straight to landfill. “It is disheartening, when people are doing what they can. It’s a hard juxtaposition.”View image in fullscreenAn estimated 250,000 tents per year are left behind at festivals.Photograph: Lauren MasonMason made a TikTok about all the pristine goods left behind at the festival, before switching off her phone and heading off to visit her brother. The next time she switched her phone on, the video had gone viral, amassing millions of views. It was at this moment that Mason realised there was an opportunity to do something bigger.That summer Mason co-founded Retribe, along with her friend Benjamin Harman, with the aim of collecting tents from festivals and upcycling them into all sorts of new items: tote bags, bottle carriers, clothes, accessories. Every piece is unique and made with as little waste as possible. “Even if your tent’s broken, that material is great for loads of other things. That’s what we’re trying to show people,” Mason says.An estimated 250,000 tents a year are left behind at festivals, according to the Association of IndependentFestivals. “People see it as part of the price tag – as more of a throwaway. It’s really sad,” Mason says. “These tents are made out of nylon or polyester, which takes hundreds of years to decompose.

After the second world war, rising prosperity, globalisation and technological advancements led to our throwaway culture. Why not buy a jacket in three sizes and throw away the spares when it’s mass produced abroad for almost nothing and shipped directly to your door? Each year the UK generates about 1.7m tonnes of textile waste. The clothes that don’t go straight to landfill can end uppolluting beaches in Ghanaorpiled up in the Atacama desert.Retribe is part of a wider fight against such overconsumption and harmful waste. In the last few years there has been a global explosion in the secondhand clothes market through sites such as Vinted or Depop. It has grown 2.7 times faster than the overall clothing market, according to research from the resale platform ThredUp.And the culture of repair and upcycling has gone mainstream, with TV programmes such as The Repair Shop, and viral TikTok and Instagram coverage of upcycling furniture or clothes. Last year, the EU passed a landmarkright to repair lawthat means if something breaks, the manufacturer has to repair the product for a reasonable price and within a reasonable timeframe after the legal guarantee period.“People are learning at the minute,” says Mason. “Bigger companies, smaller companies, we’re all learning about how bad everything we’ve done in the last 50 years has been for our planet, and what we can do after a product gets to the end of its life.“Even if we’re just encouraging one person not to bin their tent, that’s 10 metres of fabric, minimum, going to landfill for hundreds of years. But if we can make a tote bag out of that for them to use for shopping, and now they don’t have to buy carrier bags any more, that’s amazing! We need to make these small changes to make a bigger difference in the end. Small and mighty, that’s what we are.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

I know a lot of companies are upcycling on a bigger scale who get grants from the EU, and that’s all finished now for us. I do feel like we’re behind in the UK.”Nevertheless, seeing her products out there keeps Lauren going.

El Granado in Spain, hit 39.1C, while Canet-en-Roussillon inFrancepeaked at 32.3C.Parts of Portugalhad been forecast to reach 40Con Thursday but it is unclear whether this temperature was reached. It would be the hottest temperature to be recorded so early in the year in the country.The hot weather is expected to continue into next week as high pressure settles across much ofEurope. Temperatures on Friday and at the weekend are likely to reach 37C in Madrid and exceed 40C in Seville. Paris is also expected to top 30C by Saturday.The high temperatures, amid the worst drought in decades, have raised concerns among farmers in parts of northern Europe as unusually dry weather this spring has delayed crops such as wheat and corn.Europe is not the only region experiencing an early taste of summer. After several days of persistent colder than normal weather, record heat has returned toCanada.On Wednesday, 35.9C was recorded in Ashcroft and Kamloops in British Columbia, with 35.2C in Lytton. Temperatures again climbed to the mid-30s in British Columbia on Thursday, with provisionally record-breaking warmth expected on Friday across the Northwest Territories, where the spring provincial record is under threat.Meanwhile, another active Atlantic hurricane season has been forecast. The period, which runs from June to November, is expected to be busier than normal, with between six and 10 hurricanes expected, up to five of which could be major category 3 or above storms, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Last year, 11 hurricanes developed during the season, five of which were classified as major.Sea surface temperatures are higher than normal across much of the tropical Atlantic – and are expected to remain so over the coming months. Additionally, a weak La Niña or El Niño southern oscillation neutral conditions are favoured by forecast models through the summer. These are likely to promote the development of tropical storms.However, the start of the season is expected to be quiet, with longer-range forecast models showing a low risk of storm development over the next 10 days. However, there are signs activity could increase from mid-June.Explore more on these topicsEnvironmentWeather trackerSpainPortugalEuropeCanadaFranceanalysisShareReuse this content"

We protected the economy in a time of crisis nearly 17 years ago, now we are focused on securing Britain’s future in a new era of global change.”The government has now exited all of the banks it helped bail out during the financial crisis, the Treasury said.RBS became a symbol of the UK banking sector’s implosion during the 2008 global financial crisis, with public ire focusing on itsaggressive expansion under the former chief executive Fred “The Shred” Goodwin. Goodwin was stripped of his knighthood in 2012, but is now estimated to be receiving a pensionworth nearly £600,000 per year.In 2007 RBS led a consortium to buy the Dutch bank ABN Amro for £49bn – a huge sum at the top of the market. It was then the largest deal in financial services history, and for a short period made RBS the world’s biggest bank. With £2.2tn in assets, it was more than double the size of the UK economy.Executives’ excessive spending, which extended to private jets and a lavish £350m campus outside Edinburgh, also stretched the bank’s finances just as the sector was facing a credit crunch.RBS was eventually forced to take a state bailout in October 2008, with the taxpayer eventually injecting £45bn into the lender, without which millions of customers’ savings would have been put at risk.It left the government with an 84% stake in the banking group, leading to years of government austerity that many blame for hollowing out public services across the country.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

NatWest alsofast-tracked the processthrough multibillion-pound share buybacks.That process is now completed, bringing NatWest back into full private ownership nearly two decades after taxpayers saved it from the brink.NatWest chief executive, Paul Thwaite, said: “This is a significant moment for NatWest Group, for all those who work here and for the UK more widely. As we turn the page on the financial crisis, we can look to the future with confidence, without forgetting the lessons of the past.”Explore more on these topicsNatWest GroupFinancial crisisBankingEconomicsFinancial sectorPrivatisationRoyal Bank of ScotlandnewsShareReuse this content"

As an official gift to Charles as head of state, the car will become part of the royal mews to be used on official occasions and not for private use, sources indicated. The Bahraini king also gave Charles a decorative clock.The feather crown was a present from Amazonian Indigenous leaders, and the traditional South Pacific coconut leaf hats were from the president of the Marshall Islands. There were plenty of trees, too, from tree saplings given by the Swedish royal family to a Tirolean pine tree from the Austrian president.Other coronation gifts included a table and a model ship from the emir of Kuwait; a decorative pot from the sultan of Brunei; and, from the then US president, Joe Biden, a leather folder containing printed letters betweenQueen Elizabeth IIand President Dwight D Eisenhower inviting the latter to the UK, with a photograph of the visit.View image in fullscreenKing Charles with King Hamad Bin Isa al-Khalifa of Bahrain at Windsor Castle in November last year.Photograph: Aaron Chown/PAThe late queen received a trio of brooches among other gifts for her platinum jubilee – a white gold, platinum and diamond brooch from the Goldsmiths’ Company, a diamond and platinum brooch from the Freemasons, and a platinum pearl and diamond brooch from the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic. The jewellery will become part of the royal collection and may be worn by other members of the royal family.Two lamp-posts outside the Houses of Parliament in the form of bronze sculptures of heraldic beasts were presented by both houses for the jubilee. China’s president, Xi Jinping, sent a large cloisonné ornament in the design of azun, a wine vessel used in ancient Chinese rituals, with motifs and patterns symbolising royalty and good fortune.The Australian air force in 2021 sent the queen a practical gift of six dog jackets of varying sizes. Joe and Jill Biden, on the occasion of having tea at Windsor Castle, contributed an engraved specially commissioned Tiffany sterling silver box and a floral brooch.Gifts received byQueen Camillainclude lapis lazuli gemstones from Hamid Karzai, the former president of Afghanistan, and a brooch from the crown prince of Kuwait.This is the first official gifts register to be published in the king’s reign and dates back to 2020. Normally the list is published on the royal family website annually, but the Covid pandemic, the death of Elizabeth and the coronation led to delays.Gifts cannot be sold or exchanged and eventually become part of the royal collection, which is held in trust for successors and the nation.Explore more on these topicsKing Charles coronationMonarchyKing Charles IIIQueen Elizabeth IIQueen's platinum jubileeQueen CamillanewsShareReuse this content"

Labour have embarrassed themselves again with this comparison.”On Friday, a spokesperson for the attorney general said he acknowledged that “his choice of words was clumsy and regrets having used this reference” but added that he “rejects the characterisation of his speech by the Conservatives”.“The attorney general gave a speech defending international law, which underpins our security, protects against threats from aggressive states like Russia and helps tackle organised immigration crime,” the spokesperson said.Farage, the leader of Reform UK, has longcampaigned for the UK to leave the ECHR. Badenoch said earlier this year that the UKmay have to quit the conventionand other international agreements if they stopped ministers from acting “in our national interest”.Hermer said in his speech to the Royal United Services Institute: “The claim that international law is fine as far as it goes, but can be put aside when conditions change, is a claim that was made in the early 1930s by ‘realist’ jurists in Germany, most notably Carl Schmitt, whose central thesis was in essence the claim that state power is all that counts, not law.“Because of the experience of what followed in 1933, far-sighted individuals rebuilt and transformed the institutions of international law, as well as internal constitutional law.” Adolf Hitler became chancellor of Germany in 1933.Schmitt was highly influential under the Nazis and wrote about sovereignty and the effective exercise of power without the constraint of legal norms.Hermer said the government’s approach was “a rejection of the siren song that can sadly now be heard in the Palace of Westminster, not to mention some sections of the media, that Britain abandon the constraints of international law in favour of raw power”.“Let me be crystal clear: I do not question for a moment the good faith, let alone patriotism, of the pseudo-realists, but their arguments if ever adopted would provide succour to [Vladimir] Putin,” he said.In his same speech, Hermer argued that “we must not stagnate in our approach to international rules” and “must be ready to reform where necessary”.Explore more on these topicsRichard HermerHuman rightsKemi BadenochNigel FarageReform UKConservativesnewsShareReuse this content"

His mother has not eaten any food since 29 September 2024, the date her son’s prison sentence was due to end. She had been surviving on herbal tea, black coffee, rehydration salts and 300-calorie liquid supplements.She resumed her full hunger strike on 20 May, saying: “Nothing has changed, nothing is happening.”UN investigators have declared Abd El-Fattah’s imprisonment in breach of international law. Earlier this year, Keir Starmer promised he would “do everything I can” to ensure his release.In a statement on Friday, Soueif’s family said she had received glucagon treatment, which induces the liver to break down stored fat to obtain glucose, but continued to refuse treatment that would provide her with calories.She was previously admitted to hospital in February, with doctors saying she was at “high risk of sudden death”.

Around 5,000 foreign students – 27% of the current student body – are currently studying there. He also called some Harvard students “crazed lunatics” who “spew fake anger and hate”.Last Sunday, after a judge blocked his administration’s attempt to stop Harvard’s right to enroll overseas students, he demanded “names and countries” of every foreign student at the university.“We want to know who those foreign students are, a reasonable request since we give Harvard BILLIONS OF DOLLARS, but Harvard isn’t exactly forthcoming,” Trumpposted.Lawyers representing Harvard referenced the posts in their presentation to a court in Boston on Thursday. The judge, Allison Burroughsextendeda temporary restraining order issued last week blocking the ban.“The Truth Social posts prove a deep hostility to Harvard, and Harvard believes they also suggest that hostility is based on Harvard’s exercise of its first amendment activity,” David Super, a law professor at Georgetown Universitytold the New York Times. “So these quotes help Harvard prove its particular claims.”In oneespecially vitriolic postlast month, Trump wrote: “Harvard has been hiring almost all woke, Radical Left, idiots and ‘birdbrains’ who are only capable of teaching FAILURE to students and so-called ‘future leaders’.”Harvard, in common with many other universities, has been accused of failing to combat antisemitism following outbreaks of campus protests over Israel’s war against Hamas in Gaza.The tug-of-war intensified after its president, Alan Garber, rejected administration demands for reforms that the university bosses say would mean surrendering vital academic freedoms.Trump has sincethreatenedon Truth Social to strip Harvard of its tax-exempt status, writing: “We are going to be taking away Harvard’s Tax Exempt Status. It’s what they deserve!”The attempt to block foreign student enrollment – an important source of university revenue – was first announced last Friday by Kristi Noem, the homeland security secretary, whoaccusedHarvard’s leaders of failing to “confront pervasive race discrimination and antisemitic harassment”. She also said the university’s leadership had “engaged in coordinated activity with the [Chinese communist party]”.Trump’s social media posts have been cited in other recent cases challenging his administration’s actions.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a watchdog group,analysed13,000 of his messages and found multiple threats of revenge, retaliation and retribution against his political opponents, including Joe Biden, if he returned to power. One reading ““IF YOU GO AFTER ME, I’M COMING AFTER YOU!” was invoked by prosecutors as evidence in court filings.Trump, in turn, claimed his posts were being used against him as he fought justice department investigations into his role in the January 6 insurrection and retention of classified documents.His recent prolific posting also reprises hisactions during a trial last year over a defamation actionbrought by the writer, E Jean Carroll, after she had successfully sued for damages for sexual abuse. At one point, Trump posted more than 35 times – sharing articles from conservative social media about Carroll, who was suing him for defaming her while he was president – over an eight hour period before he was due to testify, while also attacking the trial judge.Earlier in the proceeedings,he posted more than 40 timesin under an hour, challenging the veracity of her story. Carroll was subsequently awarded $83m in damages.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationDonald TrumpUS politicsSocial medianewsShareReuse this content"

This led to the development of mifepristone in 1982.Dragged before the courts and demonised by US anti-abortion groups who accused him of inventing a “death pill”, Baulieu refused to back down.“Adversity slides off him like water off a duck’s back,” Simone Harari Baulieu told AFP.“You, a Jew and a resistance fighter, you were overwhelmed with the most atrocious insults and even compared to Nazi scientists,” the French president, Emmanuel Macron, said as he presented Baulieu with France’s top honour, the Grand-Croix de la Legion d’Honneur, in 2023. “But you held on, for the love of freedom and science.”In the 1960s, literature fan Baulieu became friends with artists such as Andy Warhol.He said he was “fascinated by artists who claim to have access to the human soul, something that will forever remain beyond the reach of scientists.”Baulieu kept going into his Parisian office well into his mid-90s. “I would be bored if I did not work any more,” he said in 2023.His recent research has included trying to find a way to prevent the development of Alzheimer’s disease, as well as a treatment for severe depression, for which clinical trials are under way across the world.“There is no reason we cannot find treatments” for both illnesses, he said.Baulieu was also the first to describe how the hormone DHEA was secreted from adrenal glands in 1963.He was convinced of the hormone’s anti-ageing abilities but drugs using it only had limited effects, such as in skin-firming creams.In the US, Baulieu was also awarded the prestigious Lasker prize in 1989.After his first wife, Yolande Compagnon, died, Baulieu married Simone Harari in 2016.He leaves behind three children, eight grandchildren and nine great-grandchildren, according to the statement released by his family.Explore more on these topicsFranceAbortionEuropeHealthWomenWomen's healthnewsShareReuse this content"

The 19 had died atNew Orleans’ charity hospital between 1871 and 1872, and the research, which was commonplace at the time, sought to confirm and explore the now widelydebunkedtheory that Black people’s brains were smaller than those of other races.In the 1880s, Dr Henry D Schmidt, aNew Orleansphysician, sent the skulls to Dr Emil Ludwig Schmidt. They were taken from the bodies of 13 men, four women and two unidentified people.“They were stripped of their dignity,” Dillard University’s president, Monique Guillory, said at a news conference on Wednesday. “They were people with names. They were people with stories and histories. Some of them had families, mothers, fathers, daughters, sons, human beings.”Leipzig University is in the process ofrepatriating skulls, bringing them back to their original locations. To that end, in 2023, representatives from the university contacted the city of New Orleans to inform it of the 19 skulls. The city formed a cultural repatriation committee, led by historian Eva Baham, which includes representatives from Dillard University, the city of New Orleans, the University medical center and other community partners.View image in fullscreenBoxes containing six of the heads that were returned from Germany.Photograph: Jacob Cochran/Dillard UniversityOver the course of the last two years, the cultural repatriation committee attempted, unsuccessfully, to contact descendants of the victims. Still, they were able to find out the names of the deceased and their ages (ranging from 15 to 70), what they died from and how long they had been in New Orleans – in one instance, one of the people had been in New Orleans for only hour before dying. Only five of the identified people were from Louisiana; the others were from Virginia, North Carolina, Missouri, South Carolina, Tennessee, Georgia and Kentucky.Now, more than 150 years later, those skulls were returned to New Orleans and will be memorialized and laid to rest on Saturday – the location of the rest of their remains is unknown. A visitation will take place at Dillard University’s Lawless Memorial Chapel with a service. A memorial and jazz funeral are also scheduled for that day.The remains of 17 of the 19 people – Adam Grant, Isaak Bell, Hiram Smith, William Pierson, Henry Williams, John Brown, Hiram Malone, William Roberts, Alice Brown, Prescilla Hatchet, Marie Louise, Mahala (last name unknown), Samuel Prince, John Tolman, Henry Allen, Moses Willis and Henry Anderson – will be laid to rest with their names. Two of the 19 could not be identified. All of the remains will be stored at theHurricane KatrinaMemorial.“This is not simply about bones and artifacts. It is not only about injustices. This is about restoring and, in many ways for us here, celebrating our humanity,” Guillory said. “It is about confronting a dark chapter in medical and scientific history, and choosing instead a path of justice, honor and remembrance. And we will do so in the most sacred way we know how: in a true New Orleans fashion, with a jazz funeral that shows the world these people mattered. They belonged. They belonged here, and now they are home.”Explore more on these topicsNew OrleansRaceLouisianaGermanynewsShareReuse this content"

He said it was crucial that allied nations act together to maintain credibility against aggressors.“We are living in a time of crisis and need new ways of cooperating,” he said in the keynote speech. “Our key challenge is how to preserve peace and stability and prosperity in this current environment.“We have a challenge of revisionist countries that want to impose – under the name of spheres of influence – spheres of coercion. Countries that want to control areas from the fringes ofEuropeto the archipelagos in the South China Sea … that want to appropriate resources, whether fishing or mineral, and crowd out others for their benefit.”Macron warned against a “division between the two superpowers and an instruction to all the others that you have to choose a side”. He said: “If we do this we kill the global order … all the institutions created after the second world war to preserve peace.”Macron’s pointed speech saidFrancewas and would remain a friend and ally of the US, but it did not want to be dependent, or affected “by the decisions of a single person”.“We live in a time of the erosion of longtime alliances,” he said. “The sense that their promise might not be so ironclad is ushering in a new instability. We see it every day.”However, he said the Trump administration’s request for other nations to take on more of the burden was a “fair” one and “we need Europeans to do much more for themselves”.Sitting in the audience for Macron’s speech was the US defence secretary, Pete Hegseth, who in March accused Europeof being “pathetic”and “freeloading”, in a Signal chat with other Trump officials that was later published.Macron’s speech also warned that the failures of Europe and the US to end the Ukraine war, as well as double standards over Gaza that gave Israel a “free pass”, risked destroying the west’s remaining credibility.“What is at stake is the global order, and our credibility to protect the global order,” he said.Macron’s speech doubled down on comments earlier in the day calling for European countries to “harden their collective position” on Israel if there are not improvements to the humanitarian situation in Gaza, where the UN has said the entire population is at risk of famine.Israel accused Macronof a “crusade against the Jewish state” with his remarks. The defence minister, Israel Katz, said Israel vowed to build a “Jewish Israeli state” in the occupied West Bank, in a “clear message to Macron and his associates”.The Shangri-La dialogue draws senior officials from governments and militaries around the world for three days of speeches, expert panels and closed-door discussions. Hegseth is scheduled to speak on Saturday.Historically, the conference has hosted significant bilateral meetings, including one last year between Lloyd Austin, then the US defence secretary, and his Chinese counterpart, Dong Jun. However, this year Beijing sent just a single delegate, from the People’s Liberation Army National Defense University. It is the first time since 2019 thatChinahas not sent its defence minister.China-US relations have plummeted again since Trump took office this year, and many military-to-military channels have been suspended.China has ‘totally violated’ its trade agreement’ with the US, says TrumpRead moreSome analysts have suggested Dong’s absence is a missed opportunity for China, which could use the conference to further strengthen ties with nations that are perhaps more suspicious of the US. Others have noted that at previous conferences China has been criticised on panel after panel.Zhou Bo, a retired senior Chinese army colonel attending the conference, told the Guardian the absence was not unusual, as China had sent defence ministers only five times in the past.Zhou said he did not know why China had sent a smaller delegation, but he dismissed rumours that the minister was embroiled in corruption investigations, noting that Dong was traveling overseas.“Will the world change much because the Chinese defence minister will not come? Or are there not other occasions for China to talk about its own views? Yes, there are,” he said.Explore more on these topicsEmmanuel MacronFranceSingaporeChinaUS foreign policyTrump administrationEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Born in Kenya while it was still under British rule he was anti-colonialist, a communist, anti-dictatorial, and an almost militant proponent for African languages being used for African literature.His best works exist at the interface between the political and the personal. His first book of essays, Homecoming, is at once engaging and polemical. His early novels Weep Not, Child and A Grain of Wheat look at the impact of colonialism and the Mau Mau rebellion on individual lives. He was strangely at his best with the personal and the intimate, but his reputation grew more from his political stances – first against the British government, then against the dictatorship in Kenya in the 70s. He was jailed not for a thundering political text but for a play in Kikuyu called I Will Marry When I Want. In prison he wrote his memoir on toilet paper.When I first met him I expected to meet a socialist firebrand but instead encountered a genial, engaging man who had read some of my writing and asked about my influences. I was genuinely surprised by his warmth, his humour and his friendliness. He was at ease with white as well as black people. He loved a good drink, enjoyed conversation and had a genuine love for literary small talk.Ngũgĩ wa Thiong’o, giant of African literature, dies aged 87Read moreI first knew him after his release from prison during his time in London. At the African Centre he would have a coterie of political acolytes and well wishers who wanted to ease his time in exile. I had conversations with him about literature. He was interested in my reading. I remember one particular conversation. At the time I had only published my first two novels and I was in my early 20s.“What novels do you read?” he asked.“All of you.”“Who else?”“Tolstoy, Dostoevsky.”“Which Dostoevsky?”“Crime and Punishment.”“Did you read that before or after you wrote your second novel?”And I froze. The question made me aware of something that I had not considered before: the implied relationship between the greatness of the books you have read and the quality of the books you write after reading them. I suddenly felt ashamed that the novel I had written did not do that reading justice. Whatever answer I gave was a chastened one.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

They said Bertolt Brecht was like that too. In his gentle way Ngũgĩ compelled you to come up with cogent answers to the probing remarks he made about African literature and the question of language, a question of authenticity. In his company you could not be lazy.View image in fullscreenReady laughter … Ngũgĩ wa Thiong’o at his home in Orange, CA in 2022.Photograph: Michael Tyrone Delaney/The GuardianHe also took an interest in my pool game and would often place bets on me in pubs in Covent Garden. Between frames we would talk about books. He had an almost mystical awe for what Achebe achieved in Things Fall Apart. Looking back to a time when the only literature being taught at universities was Dickens and Conrad et al, he made me feel how thrilling it was to read for the first time this novel that had found a language to express the yearning of Africans for their own story.By that time he had become a slightly portly figure with interrogative eyes and ready laughter. He tended to wear African tops and western trousers. One got the feeling with him that he had done a lot of his political thinking early but was open to the discoveries that his work led him into.He began his writing life as James Ngugi, and metamorphosed into Ngũgĩ wa Thiong’o. He began writing in English and ended by writing in Kikuyu, often having to translate himself. His anti-capitalist stance didn’t stop him becoming one of the most feted African writers in America. And in all of this, the one constant was that he remained a likable man without pretensions, and always with a feeling for the common people.Towards the end of his life, he became a perennial favourite to win the Nobel prize, and like Borges, had to endure the rise and fall of expectation every October. Family tragedy also marred his later years. But perhaps my fondest memory is of sitting with him in a Cambridge college during a Callaloo conference. We began talking about music and literature and he surprised me by saying that he was learning to play the piano for the first time. He was then in his mid-70s. He talked about the wonder of going from being unable to play a note to being able, within a few months, to play some Mozart, Chopin and Bach. It was very affecting to hear this seasoned revolutionary take on a youthful glow as he talked about this new-won skill. There happened to be a piano in a corner of the hall, and we went over. To this day I can still see him with a light smile on his face as the Bach notes tinkled into the hall.Explore more on these topicsBooksNgugi wa Thiong'ofeaturesShareReuse this content"

From having their minds blown by techno to fireworks night with Aphex Twin, they recall the highs – and explain their eternal ‘psychic’ bondFri 30 May 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 30 May 2025 10.04 EDTShareInSaint Etienne, it is usually Bob Stanley who suggests the band’s tightly defined album concepts. What if you graft folk melodies to dance music? Make vaporwave about early New Labour? While finishing ambient pop album The Night, released in the dark of last winter, Stanley pitched an even starker one for its successor: the end of their band.“I didn’t think I was saying anything uncomfortable or shocking,” says Stanley, affable and understated, in a park near his Bradford home. “When you’ve known each other for so long you have a psychic thing anyway. It felt like we would all agree.”I meet Pete Wiggs and Sarah Cracknell in a London bar, separate from Stanley – no falling out, they assure me, simply living as they do across Yorkshire, East Sussex and Oxfordshire is a scheduling nightmare. Wiggs couches his thoughts about Stanley’s proposition carefully. “Once I got used to it, I thought it was a great idea. We’ve not split up acrimoniously, and have some control over it.”International, out in September, will be the final Saint Etienne album. Bringing together collaborators including Nick Heyward, Xenomania, Erol Alkan and the Chemical Brothers – who appear on the fizzing and life-affirming new singleGlad– the album is a strictly-bangers leaving party for one of the most singular bands in British indie. Few albums are likely to contain rave hedonists Confidence Man and severe cult broadcaster Jonathan Meades, who provides text for the album’s sleeve. “I wanted to finish our album journey on a high,” says Cracknell. “Do something really special and stop in our prime.”Stanley remembers a time in pop when most groups did finish, powering pop’s forward motion. He argues that it has slowed, pointing to the decade it took for the hyperpop music on the PC Music record label – which he adored – to reach the mainstream on Charli xcx’s Brat last year. That type of underground-to-overground travel “used to happen all the time, and it would take 18 months”, says Stanley. Pop is “clearly nowhere near as important as it used to be – we might as well be talking about jazz or modern classical, where there’s great music but it’s not really adding much [to culture]. But music wasn’t that important before the 1920s, either.” Like Saint Etienne themselves, “these things don’t last for ever”.What about the current crop of exciting female pop stars? Stanley praises “the look, the sound, the artwork” of the “properly great” Charli, Lana Del Rey and Sabrina Carpenter. But he maintains that “music’s just not as central to people’s identities” as it was. If that sounds like a controversial position, he has others. “I hate Glastonbury,” he says. “Can’t stand it. A single setting for all kinds of music feels entirely wrong to me.”Stanley has always been opinionated about music. “I loved Grease,” remembers Wiggs of his early teens growing up alongside Stanley in Croydon. “Even then, Bob was telling me it was nothing on the original 50s stuff.” Later, the pair set up fanzines Pop Avalanche and Caff, but the indie music they covered became “very dreary”, Stanley says. “When house and techno came along it was like, ‘Oh, this is it.’”View image in fullscreen‘She didn’t sing with an American accent, which then was unusual’ … Sarah Cracknell fronting Saint Etienne in 1993.Photograph: Andy Willsher/RedfernsNeither of them were musicians, but radical, sample-heavy singles by UK producers Bomb the Bass and S’Express convinced them they didn’t need to be. Though Wiggs later studied for a film music degree, Stanley wears his inability to play an instrument as “an asset” – if he could play Chopin, he argues, his instincts as a pop fan might have diminished. Composer and orchestrator David Whitaker, who worked on their 1994 album Tiger Bay, saw his potential and offered him piano lessons. “Lovely bloke,” remembers Stanley, “but I was like, I really actually think I don’t want to learn.” Besides, “nobody ever asks Pet Shop Boys if they can play the piano”.Learning songwriting on the job meant that their first single was a cover. Only Love Can Break Your Heart was a thrilling landgrab of Neil Young’s 1970 original, at once faster and slower with brisk house pianos and languid dub reggae. The pair’s plan was to have rotating singers, in that case indie singer Moira Lambert, and down the pub they casually signed to friend Jeff Barrett’s new Heavenly Recordings, who released the single in May 1990.Cracknell heard the single and loved it. Born to a showbiz Windsor family (her mother, Julie Samuel, was an Avengers star, her father, Derek Cracknell, Kubrick’s recurring first assistant director), teenage Cracknell was galvanised by indie band Felt’s shambling melancholy and spent the 1980s “getting close to a record deal” with various bands. But she had given up, and was enrolled in drama school when Stanley’s girlfriend suggested her for a featured vocal. “I liked that she didn’t sing with an American accent,” says Stanley of his first impressions, “which then was unusual.”But what attracted Cracknell to them? “They had the 1960s, dance music and melancholy,” she smiles. Stanley and Wiggs asked Cracknell to become the group’s sole, permanent singer, and the newly minted trio recorded debut Foxbase Alpha in the Mitcham council house of producer Ian Catt’s parents. Using samples from bygone British pop and TV – there were too many legal challenges to US samples at the time – the album was powered by a tension between pop’s past and present that would become a very Saint Etienne mix, packed with shout-outs to the city they had just moved to.View image in fullscreenSaint Etienne at Shepherd’s Bush Empire in 2012.Photograph: Jim Dyson/Redferns/Getty Images“I was always scared of London, growing up in Croydon,” says Stanley, who remembers marvelling over exotic neighbourhood names such as Shacklewell and Haggerston. “This was when all the districts were very different from each other.” The trio explored London through its Irish pubs and Portuguese cafes, “pie and mash shops, old London things”. That geography was all over their 1993 masterpiece So Tough, with trip-hop and wide-eyed symphonic pop bathed in bright echo – as if recalling a radio show from last night’s dream.They argue that they used success to do what pop fans, rather than what Stanley views as their more tribal indie peers, would prioritise, like releasing a Christmas single or wearing gold lamé suits on the telly. “We were all quite hedonistic,” Cracknell says of those years, “but maybe that’s why we stayed together? We used to go out to clubs a lot.” This led to remixes by Andrew Weatherall and Autechre. “We went to watch Bonfire Night fireworks in Highbury with Aphex Twin,” remembers Stanley, after visiting the elusive producer at his flat to commission a remix.I found it very difficult to get through singing the last song on the album without crying. The realisation really hit meSarah CracknellDespite inviting a nascent Oasis to support them – Stanley had met Noel Gallagher as a roadie, and they all loved the band’s Live Forever demo – they avoided being dubbed Britpop, which Stanley today terms “nationalistic” and “the absolute antithesis” of their project. The pounding Eurodance of 1995’s He’s On the Phone protested against that era’s guitars, and became their biggest hit. The producer who mixed the track, Brian Higgins, offered them a demo that they turned down: it became Believe by Cher. “We’d probably be living in solid gold houses now,” says Stanley.Reinventing for Y2K, they decamped to Berlin with glitchy electronic trio To Rococo Rot, who teased them about indulgences such as changing chords. They dialled down the bleeps and thuds of the city’s club scene, resulting in their subtle and slept-on album Sound of Water. Its second single, Heart Failed, bitterly surveyed New Labour Britain and its market-driven urban regeneration: “Sold the ground to a PLC / Moved the club out to Newbury / Sod the fans and their families.” That flattened culture was explored again in the 2005 documentary Saint Etienne made with film-maker Paul Kelly about east London’s desolate Lower Lea Valley before it disappeared to Olympic development.Throughout their career, Stanley is proud that Saint Etienne got “no bigger or smaller” in the size of venues they played, and cites Bob Dylan and Prince as role models for staying true to oneself. They all credit their decision to swear off long tours as key to longevity. “How the hell do people do this?” Stanley remembers thinking after even a relatively brisk jaunt.“That, and we’ve all got complementary personalities,” says Wiggs. “No horrific egos,” agrees Cracknell.More recently, 2021’s I’ve Been Trying to Tell You used the melancholic vaporwave genre to examine late-90s nostalgia (they were disappointed that no one worked out that its track names were all horses that won on the day of Labour’s 1997 landslide). By the time of The Night, Stanley was suffering sleepless nights raising a small child while Wiggs and Cracknell were fretting about older children leaving home. The drizzly, downbeat album contained spoken word from Cracknell mourning the “energy and belief” of their 20s and was provisionally titled Tired Dad. They were “talking to people of a similar vintage to us, and being honest about it”, says Wiggs.View image in fullscreenSaint Etienne today, from left: Pete Wiggs, Sarah Cracknell and Bob Stanley.Photograph: Awaiting credit infoRecording International was low on drama – “because we’re English”, says Stanley – until final song The Last Time, written as a farewell to each other and their loyal audience. “I found it very difficult to get through singing it without crying,” says Cracknell, whose confiding and soulful vocals have arguably been Saint Etienne’s greatest asset. “It was the last song we recorded for the album, and the realisation really hit me.”Outside the project that has consumed them for three decades, Wiggs is working on a film soundtrack, Stanley is writing more books (he has already written two doorstopping histories of pop music), and the two will continue their celebrated archival pop compilations for reissue label Ace Records. Cracknell winces that she has “not thought past the end of 2025”, which makes her anxious. Is there a risk their end might not be permanent? “I don’t think there is,” says Stanley, who is looking forward to meeting his bandmates and their families without talking shop. Wiggs and Cracknell’s kids are, they tell me proudly, “like cousins”.Cracknell, an only child, was “always collecting siblings” – until Saint Etienne. Asked what she is most proud of, it is not their 13 albums or Top of the Pops appearances, but their friendship. “That we have such a bond between the three of us,” she says, looking out now to the bar’s exit. “And that will never go.”International by Saint Etienne will be released by Heavenly Recordings in September.Explore more on these topicsSaint EtiennePop and rockDance musicfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Its stars, makers and Winn talk floods, fog and forgivenessFri 30 May 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 30 May 2025 07.29 EDTShare‘Ihave played a lot of powerful, well-dressed women in my career,” says Gillian Anderson. They flash before your eyes: Margaret Thatcher (The Crown), Eleanor Roosevelt (The First Lady), Emily Maitlis (thePrince Andrew/Newsnight drama Scoop) – as well as the formidable sex therapist in the Netflix hit Sex Education, a role that led to her being inundated with dildos from over-enthusiastic fans. “These are all women in control of themselves and their environment. Any time I have an opportunity to steer against that, particularly lately, it’s of interest to me.”There is steering in another direction, and then there is the screeching handbrake turn represented by her role inThe Salt Path, adapted from Raynor Winn’s 2018 memoir of homelessness and hope along the coastline of England’s south-west. Playing Winn, Anderson is shown making a single teabag stretch for several cuppas, withdrawing the final £1.38 from her bank account, and warming her blistered feet by a pub fire. A typical day begins with her peeing in the undergrowth. It’s a far cry from Agent Scully in The X-Files.View image in fullscreenGillian Anderson in season two of Sex Education.Photograph: NetflixWinn’s response to a double catastrophe in her life in 2013 was to embark on the lengthySouth West Coast Path walkwith her husband, Moth. The film’s opening scene shows the couple’s tent being flooded during a King Lear-level storm. A flashback then reveals how they ended up in this sorry, soggy state. A bad investment left them saddled with crippling debts and the couple lost the farm in Wales where they had brought up their now-adult children. While cowering in the hallway from bailiffs, Winn took inspiration from a cherished book glimpsed among their partly packed belongings: Five Hundred Mile Walkies, in whichMark Wallington recounts the trekhe and his dog took around the south-west.He must have miscalculated the journey, however. It is in fact 630 miles, including many steep ascents and descents. And as if penury and homelessness were not challenging enough, Moth had recently been diagnosed with a rare brain disease, corticobasal syndrome, and advised by doctors to rest. Stairs, he was told, would be particularly problematic.View image in fullscreenIsaacs and Anderson in The Salt Path.Photograph: Steve Tanner/Black BearTwelve years and those 630 miles later, Moth Winn is, miraculously, still alive. He is played in the film byJason Isaacs, who sits beside his screen wife today in a London hotel room. Their contrasting body language is instantly revealing. The 56-year-old Anderson, friendly but with a casually authoritative aura, is perched side-saddle in her chair, one leg crossed away from me, so that she seems almost to be looking back over her shoulder in my direction as she speaks. Isaacs, 61, leans forward, elbows on knees, keen to get stuck in. It is as if they are still playing their parts from The Salt Path: Raynor Winn, with her patina of reserve and caution, and Moth, eager to make sure everyone else is comfortable, a people-pleaser even when the people aren’t worth pleasing, as some of those they meet on their travels manifestly are not. A passerby berates them for wild camping, beating their tent with his stick. In a scene that hasn’t made it from page to screen, Winn is humiliated by a woman who spots her scrambling on the ground for dropped coins and assumes she is drunk.It’s about two people and a path. I couldn’t grasp how that could be a filmRaynor WinnDespite those flashes of conflict, Winn had doubts about how her story would work on screen. “It’s about two people and a path,” she tells me from the home she and Moth now share in Cornwall. “I couldn’t grasp how that could be a film.” ButMarianne Elliott, the acclaimed stage directorof War Horse, Angels in America, and Company, makes her screen directing debut here and tells me she always saw The Salt Path as inherently cinematic. “Ray and Moth hardly talk on their walk,” she says. “They are carrying their trauma on their back, but then they slowly calm down and start to look up and engage with the majestic landscapes. And they are changed by it. It felt like nature was playing with them, like a wild beast – sometimes giving them beauty and wonder, and sometimes battering them cruelly. They were reformed by the elements, if you like.”View image in fullscreenJason Isaacs, left, as Moth Winn with Raynor and Moth Winn and Gillian Anderson.Photograph: Capital Pictures/AlamyPlaywright and screenwriter Rebecca Lenkiewicz, who adapted The Salt Path for the screen, says she saw nature as the key to unlocking the film version. “Any reservations were about the walking,” she says. “You know: how do we make walking dynamic for that amount of time? It felt like we needed almost to take the weather and the landscape as a character. It needed to be a film with a lot of silence. It’s not some chatty, walky comedy.”Watching Isaacs trudging across English landscapes, however magnificent, feels incongruous after all those scenes of him suffering existential despair in luxurious five-star surroundings in the Thailand-setthird season of The White Lotus. I assume he will be heartily sick of talking about the series by now, but it is he who brings up the similarity between the characters he plays. “They’re both men who lose everything. And they react in very different ways, which is a measure of who they are.”His character in The White Lotus was prone to suicidal ideations. So, too, was the apparently upbeat Moth. “He laughs all the time, even when he’s describing the toll his disease has taken on him. But he felt suicidal on the walk. He and Ray were crippled with shame, and the future was this abyss for them. They hid that from one another. They constantly made each other laugh. Acting is a game of pretend, and that’s what they were both doing.”View image in fullscreenRaynor and Moth Winn at home in Polruan, Cornwall, with their dog Monty.Photograph: Jim Wileman/The GuardianWhat were Anderson’s first impressions of Raynor? “I was surprised at how guarded she was,” she says. “Of course, it must be strange: you’ve got two relatively famous actors who are going to play you showing up at your house. But it was interesting to encounter a certain steeliness. It was informative for me to see that.” “Youcan be quite steely,” Isaacs says. “You’ve got that in you.” “Oh, definitely,” she agrees. “I know that about myself.”Having been surprised when her memoir was optioned, Winn says she was even more taken aback by the casting. “I remember thinking, ‘How isthatgoing to work? How will someone so perfect and glamorous capture me in that raw state?’” Things got even more confusing when she told Moth the news. “He thought I meantPamelaAnderson.”During the first meeting between the four of them, the Winns explained to the actors the details of how they packed, knowing that they couldn’t take more than what could be carried on their backs. “Then they put the tent up for us right there in the living room,” Isaacs says. “I’m not sure if I’d …ever… camped … before,” says Anderson, stringing the words out as though anticipating derision. “You’d never pitched a tent?” asks Isaacs in mild disbelief. “Not as far as I can remember,” she says. “Imighthave pitched one for my kids in the back garden.”View image in fullscreenIsaacs in season three of The White Lotus.Photograph: HBOIsaacs says he is “all about climbing things, jumping off things, swimming through things. Canyons and stuff. I like extreme physical experiences. Even at my advanced age, I see something and I think, ‘That’d be fun to climb up. Or slide down.’ I’m still a 12-year-old boy trapped in a 100-year-old body.”As a child, he went wild camping with his family in Wales. “We’d get woken by farmers. Or livestock.” Once, they parked in heavy fog on a small hill and pitched their tent. “You couldn’t see your hand in front of you. We woke up to find we’d camped on a roundabout.” Anderson gasps and claps her hands: “That’s such a good story!”They wanted to avoid towns because they got treated badly thereJason IsaacsThe Salt Path began life as a diary that Winn kept on the walk, and which she later wrote up as a gift for Moth – and, more urgently, as a way of preserving the experience for him as his memory began to fade. That diary spawned a Big Issue article and then a book, nominated for theCosta prize in 2018. The judges called it “an absolutely brilliant story that needs to be told about the human capacity to endure and keep putting one foot in front of another”.The picture will doubtless reignite interest in the South West Coast Path, and attract more walkers after a recent downturn. To anyone tempted to wonder whether walking is having “a moment”, what with the film of The Salt Path followingDavid Nicholls’s novel You Are Here(about a friendship that blooms on a 200-mile coast-to-coast hike across the north of England), it is as well to remember that what the Winns did was born out desperation. They found beauty and a kind of salvation, and the walk even seemed to help Moth to defy his doctors’ prognosis, but it was often a ghastly, hardscrabble journey.“They were desperate and lonely and scared,” says Isaacs. “They wanted to avoid towns because they got treated badly there and they had no money to buy food. They were happier by themselves away from people. They experienced both sides of human nature: tremendous compassion and generosity but also abuse and neglect. They were frightened of the police and of anyone who would come along and dehumanise them just because they were homeless. Though the book itself was a love letter to Moth, there’s a marked lack of sentimentality when they speak about what happened. They got all kinds of different benefits from the walk but they still wanted a warm roof over their heads.”The Salt Path review – Gillian Anderson and Jason Isaacs hike from ruin to renewalRead moreOne thing that is impossible to capture on screen, he says, is their persistent hunger. “It colours everything. We do our best to tell the story but that’s a physical ache. They would stand at cafe windows watching people eat.” Anderson is nodding along. “Ray talks in the book about pretending to eat, and how the fantasy of eating, the act of moving the mouth, does half the job,” she says.Winn tells me that living below the breadline has altered her for ever. “It changes how you feel about material things,” she says. “Having let go of everything we had, possessions don’t concern me in the same way they did before. Anything that doesn’t enrich your life just gets in the way. The stuff we gather can easily start to control us.” Winn says her life is much as it ever was, though Moth now tires more easily, and requires extensive physiotherapy. “Except without the worry of paying the rent.”As the author of several bestselling books, does she allow herself the occasional luxury these days? “I do,” she sighs. “Sometimes it’s nice to have the whole pasty instead of just half.”The Salt Path is in UK and Irish cinemas from 30 May.Explore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsGillian AndersonJason IsaacsFilm adaptationsAutobiography and memoirWalkinginterviewsShareReuse this content"

When the launch of a deep-fake tool by Cory Michael Smith’s billionaire Venis plunges the world into financial and social meltdown, he and his alpha male peers – Jeff (Ramy Youssef), Randall (Steve Carell) and their host Souper (Jason Schwartzman) – insouciantly ponder exploiting this “moment of creative destruction” and taking over the world. As in Succession, Armstrong has a keen eye for the supercilious world of the super-rich, where people are expendable and petty grievances can be dressed up as utopianism.Sunday 1 June, 9pm, Sky AtlanticSee How They RunView image in fullscreenSam Rockwell and Saoirse Ronan in See How They Run.Photograph: Parisa Taghizadeh/DisneyPart affectionate throwback to classic Agatha Christie, part knowing sendup, Tom George’s engagingcomic whodunnitis set in the wake of a murder after the 100th West End performance of The Mousetrap in 1953.

The country singer’s last two albums spent 29 weeks at the top of the US chart. This week his latest, fourth offering, I’m the Problem, had the biggest opening week of the year so far in the US as well as going straight in at No 1 in the UK.This prodigious achievement may owe a little to a canny release strategy: streaming metrics mean that longer albums often chart higher, and I’m the Problem weighs in at a staggering 37 tracks. Equally, all 37 are in the US singles chart this week, setting a new record – Wallen is a commercial phenomenon, the biggest country star to cross over to mainstream success since Taylor Swift.Like Swift, Wallen’s tours have graduated from arenas to stadiums, which makes this rare intimate album-launch show a spectacularly hot ticket. The preshow queue, in which Stetsons and cowboy boots figure large, stretches way down Chalk Farm Road in north London: “I hear 300,000 people tried to get tickets for tonight,” marvels Wallen.Yet it is hard to see why there is quite that level of fuss. Not even Wallen’s fiercest defenders would claim he is remotely groundbreaking. A laid-back, mustachioed, regular guy possessed of an easy-going charm, he simply perches on a bar stool and plays smooth, well-crafted country and western powered by earworm melodies.His six-piece band are slick and his lyrical themes are repetitive. Wallen sings about drinking to forget women who leave him because he drinks. He bids these escapers from his serial doomed relationships a self-pitying, passive-aggressive adieu: “If I’m the problem, you might be the reason.” Then he drinks some more, and longs for their return.Ten-gallon hits! Why country is the biggest pop music craze of 2024Read moreThese laments have the ring of authenticity. Wallen’s appeal rests largely in him being a flawed everyman figure (with two recent court convictions for public intoxication). The maudlin Superman finds him sighing that his toddler son will one day learn of his dad’s transgressions: “That bottle’s my kryptonite, brings a man of steel down to his knees.” It’s hokum, but oddly moving.Love Somebody has a melody as exquisite as Fleetwood Mac at their most swooning as Wallen craves a romance “stronger than the whiskey”. The witty wordplay inherent in all the best country is present and correct: Whiskey Glasses begins, “Poor me… pour me another drink.” And then Wallen takes his leave and ambles off to notch up a million more streams.Explore more on these topicsMusicCountryPop and rocklive music reviewsShareReuse this content"

While writer Sam Davies was touring the classrooms, he unearthed GB, another talent finishing off the record that doubles as his master’s project.It’s the stage name of Danish musician Gustav Berntsen, and his coursework submission is Ressed / Falter, a double EP that follows last year’s debut album, Gusse Music. (He also co-produced four songs on classmate Molina’s 2024 album When You Wake Up.) He shares with the famous RMC alumni an uncanny, limpid tone and a deconstructionist approach to pop, but his open-hearted naivety feels different from their mysterious sound worlds. In his boyish vocal modulations and unabashed yearning for someone he can’t stop thinking about, “dressed as a black cat” at a Halloween party while he’s dressed as Jesus, he sounds unavoidably like Arthur Russell; as does his off-kilter guitar pop, the guitar often taking a percussive role in his appealingly emo world of echo.That’s just the first part of the record: after three delicately turned pop songs, Berntsen plunges into wordless ambience, with eight tracks that recall the Kentucky post-rock scene of the 90s – the Rachel’s-like blend of beautiful guitar melodies and unsettling field recordings; heavy, Slint-y murk – and processed, lonesome Scots pipes. It’s such a distinct record, it only adds to the mystery of what’s going on at this innovative institution – but long may it turn out acts like this.Laura SnapesThis week’s best new tracksView image in fullscreenMavi, right, with Earl Sweatshirt.Photograph: Alex Free​Mavi – Landgrab (ft Earl Sweatshirt)With a sample of a rapturous old soul track by the Metaphors, this is a brilliant study in disparate flows: Mavi steadily hopscotching on the beat, Earl mooching around it.BBTAlex G – AfterlifeHe’s written dozens of songs across nine albums of much-loved slacker indie, but the lead single from Alex G’s 10th might just be his best: a mandolin-powered anthem that flings its arms wide at life’s promise.BBTSilvana Estrada – Como un PájaroWhat starts with pristine simplicity – just the Mexican songwriter’s pollen-bright voice and acoustic guitar – elegantly expands, adding piano, strings and swooping depth to a rueful ballad wrought from insomnia and heartbreak.LSView image in fullscreenInsomnia and heartbreak … Silvana Estrada.Photograph: Alexa VisciusLorde – Man of the Year“Can’t believe I’ve become someone else / Someone more like myself,” Lorde sings of a post-breakup transformation, the explosive evolution mirrored in the song’s shift from borderline a cappella to unabashed, mutant distortion.LSTops – ChlorineCanada’s best soft rock band have announced their first album in five years, teed off with this sparkling yet morose single as singer Jane Penny struggles to slip the bonds of a toxic relationship.BBTLucrecia Dalt – DivinaThe Colombian musician conjures a waltz from piano that sounds like marbles rolling over glass, with snapping fingers and her smoky, savouring lyrical delivery giving Divina a gasping sensitivity.LS​Cleyra – There’s Nothing Happening Between UsShifting through sustained passages of ambient techno like subtly changing weather, this is the 17-minute centrepiece of the Bristolian producer’s distinctive, dreamlike new album Remember This Body?BBTSubscribe to the Guardian’s rolling Add to Playlist selections on Spotify.Add to playlist – SpotifySpotifyExplore more on these topicsMusicAdd to playlistPop and rockExperimental musicIndieRapDance musicElectronic musicfeaturesShareReuse this content"

About Ghosts features an expanded version of her Amaryllis ensemble, which made one of 2024’s standout jazz albums, Cloudward. The lineup retains Adam O’Farrill (trumpet), Jacob Garchik (trombone), Patricia Brennan (vibraphone), Nick Dunston (bass) and Tomas Fujiwara (drums), augmented by Blue Note Records’ fiery, gospelly alto-sax star Immanuel Wilkins and the rugged, Wayne Shorter-like tenorist Brian Settles.These two players give this release a crucially different feel, lending richer tonalities and expressive range to Halvorson’s signature brass fanfares, boppish-to-abstract improv, restlessly interweaving melodies and vigilant drumming. Opener Full of Neon begins the set with a textbook piece of Halvorson ensemble variety: elliptically march-like percussion, squirming improv intro, fluent solos and luxurious ensemble passages with woodpecker-like horn chatter. Carved From starts to canter and chime after a soft, unaccompanied arrival in rich horn chords, and features driving improv from Halvorson and Wilkins, mixing crisply defined guitar figures and skidding elisions with flat-out, whooping alto-sax firestorms.The excitement of Halvorson’s music is not cinematic or illustrative, but in the kaleidoscopic fascination of its internal symmetries and conflict. Melody parts play rhythm patterns, then the melodies bend while the rhythms push on. Her harmonies sometimes echo jazz big bands, at others contemporary classical. The initially tender title track becomes a captivating journey of improv and constantly morphing thematic shapes, while Eventidal is a graceful guitar and vibes ballad, and the fast Absinthian and Amaranthine suggest hyper-compressed bebop lines. Recently discussing the quirkily wonderful English singer and songwriter Robert Wyatt in Jazzwise magazine, Halvorson said she loved his ability to blend “the weird with the beautiful”. She wouldn’t dream of it, but she could have been saying much the same of herself.Also out this monthThis year sees the 50th anniversary ofKeith Jarrett’s legendary Köln Concert, andNew Vienna (ECM), a 2016 gig from the now 80-year-old’s final solo tour, is a familiar but bewitching hour of hurtling free squalls, chugging-hook rockers and tender romances.

Her flute glides animatedly around Louis Sclavis’s solemnly evocative bass clarinet, rises in clamorous harmonies with Émile Parisien’s soprano sax while she eloquently chants instrumentally and vocally asArchie Sheppplays gruffly bluesy tenor sax.

The past ever present, it underpins but also threatens to undermine the two protagonists. The story opens in present-day Belfast, with Alex, a man caught up in wedding plans. He loves his Ellie, but doesn’t love all the fuss over venues and seating arrangements. The pair are paying a visit to the Manor House, a grand hotel outside the city; Ellie has her heart set on the boathouse by the lake for their reception, and wants Alex to feel the same excitement. This first chapter finds him distracted, though. Impatient with deadlines and invitations, but also keen just to be married; more specifically, to let go of his old life and his old pals from his single days. We’re not told why, only that he is tired of “all the pretences and games” and that marriage represents his “best opportunity to loosen the connection”.Chapter two returns us to the same place but a century earlier. The Manor House is home to the Remingtons, and the lake and boathouse of Ellie’s future dreams are as yet under construction, under the supervision of George Allenby. A young architect, George is also a veteran of the first world war. The fighting is not long over and he, too, would rather put his past behind him. But the lake excavation and the daily sight of his workers in the mud and rain is proving an awful reminder of the trenches. There, he was an officer; here he is once again in charge of men. George is sorely aware of their toiling, and the precarity of their employment set against the wealth of the Remingtons. George’s employers are new money, and he finds himself embarrassed at their ambitions to pass as landed gentry. He knows the lake he is constructing is part of this: a charade doomed to failure.Conflict and shipbuilding are the twin forces that have shaped Belfast, and Park excels at making this tangibleReturning to Alex, we find he is also uncomfortable in his work. He’s employed by his father in property development. Regeneration in 21st-century Belfast provides riches for some, Alex included, but he sees those left behind, not least the tenants in the shopfronts his father lets out. Among them is a barber and a tattoo artist; Alex pays them visits as landlord, but strives to be more than that, to make human connections.So Ghost Wedding is about class and power as well as the past. This finds its best expression in George’s story, in the relationship that develops between him and Cora, one of the Manor House maids. What starts as an allyship against the housekeeper – and against the awful Remington Junior – soon becomes more than that, with Cora visiting George at the cottage in the grounds where he is billeted. She’s a gift to him – and to the book. Her sharpness is beguiling, as are her appetites, her humour, her determined independence. Park is one of those rare and precious male writers – like Roddy Doyle, like Colum McCann, who have both championed his work – who write women well. Park describes George falling for Cora extremely well too. Will this love prove impossible? It’s beautifully drawn and perfectly chosen for a novel that wants its characters – and readers – to see beyond boundaries.Above all, Park wants us to look beyond the now: beyond “the calendar on the kitchen wall that pretends to control the space of days wherein we live”. Alex and Ellie are to marry by the lake that George is excavating while he falls in love with Cora; these couples are separated by a century, and by nothing at all: prey to the same dilemmas, hemmed in by the same structures. The past isn’t past. When Alex visits his father’s building projects, lying empty and derelict, he finds a kind of peace there; but Park fills the rooms for his readers, bringing us the spirits and stories of Titanic dockyard workers, and seamen who crewed the supply boats in wartime. Conflict and shipbuilding are the twin forces that have shaped Belfast and the lives of its people, and Park excels at making this tangible.Alex himself is less finely drawn. We know there’s a darkness in his past; that something unspeakable took place, in a tent, at a festival. We learn there was a young woman – too drunk, too high, and left too vulnerable. But what part did Alex play there? And what of his old friends he wants to discard? They and his memories are rather too thinly dispersed through the book to provide drive. It’s a hinterland left underexplored, and one that feels less integrated with the novel as a whole.But in George and Cora, and in the Belfast ghosts, there is more than enough to move us – and to prompt thought. “Time shuffles itself lightly, like a pack of cards. Who can tell what sequence it will deal? Who can tell what will fall across our future days?”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

I must have been three or four years old. He read the paper cover to cover, and for an hour or so each night, I watched the world go by.My favourite book growing upWhen I was 11 I would go to the library downtown and request microfilm of old newspapers. I clicked the spools into place and read and read. I was horrified and baffled and amazed that there existed so many decades, so much time, in which I was … nowhere and not yet.The book that changed me as a teenagerMy parents were educated in missionary schools in Hong Kong and Malaysia; in Vancouver, they enrolled me in a Catholic school. The religious texts and sermons that we read, and the things I saw around me, made me turn away from religion when I was a teenager; but those texts instilled in me a lasting relationship with philosophy. I left religion, but not its questions.The writer who changed my mindOmar El Akkad. I used to think that, sometimes, people are made speechless by the horror of events, by fear, by grief. Perhaps the words they need don’t exist. ButOne Day, Everyone Will Have Been Against Thisreminds us that the words are there. We have the language to describe ethnic cleansing and genocide. Whenjournalists are murdered, when183 children are killed in a single day, when15 paramedics are executed, and we stay silent, words don’t fail us – we fail our vocation and each other.The book that made me want to be a writerPlurality!

It opens as a colourful story based on the author’s family: her grandmother’s morphine addiction, her aunt Zizi’s vanity (she “boasted that all she kept in her refrigerator were beauty products”), and her mother’s reluctance to talk about the past. But what were grandmother and Zizi doing in the pages of Nazi propaganda magazine Signal? The narrator learns her family were “Nazi sympathisers”, though the phrase hardly captures the zeal of her mother Lucie’s support. The details are shocking: to Lucie and her lover, “mice, rats and Jews were basically the same”, and she has no regrets after the war. “If all the French had been on the right side, Germany would have won.” Their blinkered support has lessons for today, too. “What does it matter if something is true or false,” asks one character, “if you believe it to be true?”View image in fullscreenLovers of Franz Kby Burhan Sönmez, translated by Sami Hêzil (Open Borders, £12.99)Nazi-supporting parents feature in this novel too, set in West Berlin in 1968, the year of revolutionary protests around the world. A young man of Turkish descent faces off against a police commissioner. Ferdy Kaplan is under investigation for killing a student – but his intended target was Max Brod, the executor of Franz Kafka’s estate who published Kafka’s work against his wishes. Police suspect Ferdy had an antisemitic motive against the Jewish Brod, “influenced by [his parents’] ideas”. There’s a Kafkaesque quality to the interrogation – “It is our job to assume the opposite of what you tell us,” the police say – but Kurdish author Sönmez is really interested in the question of who owns literature. Was Brod right to publish? Would Kafka be unknown if he hadn’t? The dialogue-led approach makes the book punchy and fast-moving, and brings some surprising twists before the end.View image in fullscreenBack in the Dayby Oliver Lovrenski, translated by Nichola Smalley (Hamish Hamilton, £14.99)Sixteen-year-old Ivor is a typical schoolboy in Norway: “every day sitting in the same classroom, getting smart, creating chaos” and torn between “the side of me that wanted to do good things, and the other side saying, chill man, no stress”. That other side tends to win, as he and his friends Marco, Jonas and Arjan get up to antics that may need further translation for middle-aged readers: “bunn a zoot”, “we blazed some lemon haze”, “we rocked up like we was about to harvest some bamboo”. But amid the intensity of young male friendship, there’s love, family loyalty and vulnerability. “Sometimes you hang the biggest towel you can find over the mirror [cos] you wanna smash the face of the brother staring back at you.” The energy and richness of this novel would be impressive, even if Lovrenski hadn’t been only 19 years old when he wrote it.View image in fullscreenWaist Deepby Linea Maja Ernst, translated by Sherilyn Hellberg (Jonathan Cape, £14.99)Five friends, one week, a summerhouse: sounds like a dream – which could become a nightmare. “It’ll be like our own clever talk show, fabulous and never-ending,” says one character. Danish debut novelist Ernst delineates her characters snappily, from Esben, an experimental poet who went commercial with a novel about his mother, to Gry, who “hasn’t eaten any carbohydrates in three weeks”. But what brings the friends together and drives them apart is sex. Central to this is “confused” Sylvia, who enjoys being dominated by her “dreamboat” girlfriend Charlie: “She has been a jug full of dark, heavy liquid, and now the jug is broken”, is her description of being brought to orgasm. But Sylvia also gets angry at the “vanilla hetero-banality” of the other happily settled couples. The novel is operatic in its emotional intensity and its surprise pairings, but ultimately a lament for lost youth. “Weren’t they true radicals just a second ago?” wonders Sylvia. Weren’t we all?Explore more on these topicsFictionTranslated fiction roundupFiction in translationreviewsShareReuse this content"

One of the most interesting things about it is that Richard and Clarissa Dalloway appear as minor characters at the beginning. In each of my rereadings (and for my students who read the novel for the first time), when the Dalloways leave, it feels as though the air pressure of the novel drops for a moment. A reader feels a longing and a wistfulness watching them disappear – a feeling that Woolf must have shared too. The Dalloways must have haunted her and waited for her to become a more mature writer.Two new books I have loved and enjoyed recently are Tash Aw’sThe Southand Madeleine Thien’sThe Book of Records. Tash and Madeleine and I were young writers around the same time when we first published. I have often pondered over the trajectory of a writer’s career, and with these books both Tash and Madeleine, in my view, have written their best work (to date), which requires years of writing, reading and thinking through things. I like that we have gone beyond the “voyage out” stage and come to a more mature stage of our careers.Things in Nature Merely Growby Yiyun Li is published by4th Estate(£16.99).

But having read each of the preceding King books in order, as part of a quest that will probably never end given the author’s prolific output, I was determined to persevere with it. By the 400-page mark I had accepted its brilliance, and at the end I was left thinking what a staggering achievement it is, with an ending so perfect in its simplicity. What became apparent as the book wore on was that this is a story about humanity, the draw of others, the wish to be loved, and, most of all, how easily things can fall apart.Robert Macfarlane, authorAs Trump 2.0 rolls back rights and regulations, the forms and possibilities of “resistance” are on the minds of many. Rebecca Solnit is one of the great analysts and practitioners of resistance. Her bookHope in the Darkwas reissued as a free download the week after Trump’s first election, and on 8 May her latest,No Straight Road Takes You There, landed in bookshops. It’s an essay collection “for uneven terrain”: read it to feel inspired, and to sense firm ground underfoot as you push forwards. Joycelyn Longdon’sNatural Connectionis a brilliant first book that marches arm in arm with Solnit’s work; a narrative nonfiction that gathers and braids hopeful stories of environmental action from across the world, including Ghana, where Longdon carries out her fieldwork as a conservationist and environmental justice researcher. Last, I’ve recently finished Rob Cowen’s magnificentThe North Road. It’s a polyphonic story of the A1, AKA the eponymous Great North Road from London to Edinburgh; a telling of lives, deaths and paths. There are bravura chapters that slip the present entirely and reinhabit the Harrying of the North, for instance, or an 18th-century boxing match that took place near the road’s route, with exceptional, almost supernatural vividness.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

It’s short and to the point, and I really loved the use of Scottish vernacular too. Previously I had only read McDermid’s crime novels but she is illuminating on women’s history.

It’s like Waiting for Godot with gummy bears instead of trampsFri 30 May 2025 08.02 EDTLast modified on Fri 30 May 2025 11.08 EDTShareAs long as I can remember, my wife has started each day with 30 minutes of a Candy Crush game. As long as she can remember, I have started each day by telling her it is pointless casual gamer cack. Now I write for the Guardian, I need to find a more eloquent way of putting that, so I thought I would have a go myself. I am begging you: do not do the same. Candy Crush Soda Saga nearly ruined me in a week.I like the game mechanics. As Oscar Wilde said, the man who doesn’t love sliding stuff to form chains of three or more matching shapes does not love life itself. This one is wrapped in a cute candy veneer, all fizzy bottles and gummy bears. And that makes the visuals so alluring. When you slide a Colour Bomb into a Candy Fish all the candies that colour get Candyfished and your eyes are treated to a bazillion of them fizzing around the screen destroying everything, while the firm yet gentle haptic feedback makes it a multisensory burst of pure, effervescent joy.“What’s that clicking noise?” my wife asks.“Don’t you play it with the haptic feedback on?”“Oh, I turned that off because I thought it was hurting my phone.”“In what way?”“I felt it was putting too much … pressure on it.” She says, like her phone is the USS Enterprise and she is Scotty diverting a dangerous amount of power away from the shields.We had many chats about Candy Crush while we both played the game in bed. I’m all for increased interspousal communication, but we used to do this kind of thing with broadsheet newspapers and now we’re matching jelly beans on phones. Luckily, you just need one hand to play, so the other is free to punch yourself repeatedly in the face as you realise how pointless your life has become.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toPushing ButtonsFree weekly newsletterKeza MacDonald's weekly look at the world of gamingEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

There is no story, no real achievements. It uses a board game path to fake big-time progression, but whether it’s me on level 150 or my wife on level 8,452 (gulp!) the pattern is the same: a few easy levels then a super hard one which, if you haven’t accumulated enough power-ups, is virtually impossible.That’s when the game drops its trousers and flashes its microtransactions. And by that stage you are so hooked by the mechanics and the colour you hand over your few quid for some extra virtual visual bobbins quicker and easier than those crazy kids getting drugs in The Wire. Oh yes! Candy Crush Soda Saga is the game Stringer Bell went to business school to invent. The cigarette was once hailed as the most efficient poison delivery system ever invented. Not now.This game “suggests” moves to you. These are frequently not the best ones. That is no accident. This is a game designed to make you fail. It’s a compulsion loop, sure, but one that encourages you to pay for the pleasure. It’s not gambling per se, because you know what you are buying, but, while gambling company ads nowscreamabout setting limits and walking away, this game screams at you to have one more go.I have been addicted to so many things in my life that I stopped counting. (I became addicted to counting my addictions as well.) But this ranks as one of the worst. It only takes three days until I am dangerously hooked. Last Sunday I played Candy Crush Pop Saga for three solid hours. I nearly missed theScottish Cup finalas a result. Unlike my wife, I was dipping into it during the rest of the day as well, thinking, “Oh it’s been 15 minutes, I may have ended up getting a power-up via the Bake a Cake sub game my Candy Crush team are helping me with.”The self-loathing of the addict envelopes me. I know this is not nurturing me in any way, but I cannot stop. At least cocaine was quick. In terms of time? In one week I wasted what could have been, in Zelda terms, one third of a Breath of the Wild, one half of a Twilight Princess or an entire Majora’s Mask. And at least they tell stories. If the deadline for this article hadn’t made me stop, I would have had to have buried my phone in a lime pit and set it on fire to escape from Candy Crush.The irony is that there’s no real difference between this and the arcade offerings that made me fall in love with gaming as child. Pacman, Frogger, Space Invaders et al were all designed to make you pump another coin in the slot when it winked CONTINUE Y/N at you. They were even more repetitive. So I guess by the definition detailed in this Candy Crush castigation, those games were also a waste of time.But why didn’t they feel like that?Because back then, all I had was time. It wasn’t the dwindling commodity it is in my 50s. Maybe if I played Galaxian now it would feel like playing Candy Crush: a descent into a gaming horror world so uncomfortable it’s like watching that Event Horizon movie on treadmill while wearing Lego pants. A game that offers nothing repeatedly. Waiting for Godot with gummy bears instead of tramps. Nothing happens, nobody comes, nobody goes – it’s awful.Explore more on these topicsGamesGame cultureMobile gamescommentShareReuse this content"

The winds have ripped up houses, shops, factories and art studios, whirled the pieces in a mighty twister and smashed them to earth in pulverised fragments. Now they scatter South London Gallery, towering over you in two random heaps, with other pieces gathered in clusters, floating on the walls, thrown all over the floor. Crunch, crunch – you can walk on broken bits of wood carpeting the ground, negotiating your way around bigger debris, as you inspect the ruins of America – and, sadly, of American art.Seven decades ago, Jackson Pollock put America at the forefront of abstract art with looping and spiralling vortices of energy that he created by pouring and flicking paint on to a horizontal canvas. Leonardo Drew grew up in a housing project in Bridgeport, Connecticut, in the 60s and is consciously influenced by Pollock, whose work he first saw in a book at his local library. Where Pollock threw paint, Drew scatters splintered wood, yet his sculpture can also be seen as painting, since before breaking up many of the boards and planks in this show, he painted them. The entire installation can be seen as a huge action painting in 3D. Drew even numbers his works like Pollock did: the alternative title of Ubiquity II is Number 436.But if action painting in the 50s was a freewheeling image of the improvisational American spirit, this is the debris of a shattered American dream. You get a sense, contemplating Drew’s crafted rubble, of surveying the aftermath of a cataclysmic weather event or walking the streets of a US town obliterated by the latest freak hurricane or tornado. This is painfully resonant given the Trump administration’s policy of active climate crisis denial, including the withdrawal of government funding for research. And, as the eerie silence of this world in smithereens, broken only by the wood cracking under your feet, reminds you, some of the most traumatic indicators of climate emergency, from storms to fires, have hit the US itself.View image in fullscreenConsciously influenced by Jackson Pollock … Ubiquity II.Photograph: Studio Stagg/Andy Stagg @studiostaggDrew doesn’t claim his art is political in any direct way: it is abstract. I’m reading Trump into it. But although I could go on like this, identifying artistic echoes and urgent themes, it’s forced. This artwork is disappointing. On paper, and in photographs, Drew’s work seemed spectacular, yet as soon as I walked into the gallery my heart sank. There’s a lumpen, flat, unthreatening feeling to this show. It’s as depressing as a destroyed town but without the danger or horror. In fact, it’s hard to feel anything at all about an assemblage that fails to suggest motion, energy or life.When you enter the long, tall white space, the first disappointment is the way wooden items are stuck around the walls. They don’t look like flying fragments propelled through space, but decorations on a bedroom wall. Some resemble cricket bats. One looks like a gun. Whatever they are meant to be, they are as radical as wrapping paper.The second blow to anyone seeking artistic fun is the sight of the two tottering heaps with a valley between them through which you can pass. “Tottering” is inaccurate, for they are clearly not about to fall. You can see the scaffolding on which the artist has built his Towers of Babel. Everything is safely, staidly stuck in place. I’m not saying it should fall, but where is the dramatic tension?The only hint of danger or dynamism is in the starbursts around the floor. One looks like a fist of rapidly expanding matter. It makes you think of the exploding enemy plane in Roy Lichtenstein’s painting Whaam! – which is itself an ironic homage to Pollock’s action art. Maybe the contrast is deliberate, for Drew says his art is a meditation on entropy. So the energetic, propulsive assemblages may be newborn stars or fragments of the big bang. But the sagging heaps of crap are the universe approaching its death, Earth under an avalanche of garbage, America at the end of its time.Maybe so. But it’s dreary to look at. It’s not just at the macro scale that the installation appears inert. Every small chunk you look at, in the heaps, on the walls, has an arbitrary wanness up close. Nothing seems to mean much, or matter much.Perhaps Drew is simply crushed by these times. But it seems to me this work, with its conscious echoes of Pollock that fail to recapture the excitement or surprise of America’s modern art glory days, is a symptom of a nation in cultural as well as political decline. Trump’s America is a shell of what it once was. Americans were creatively brilliant not so long ago, pumping out the best art, novels, music. But this exhausted art looks to me like the product of a decaying country.South London Gallery from 30 May to 7 DecemberExplore more on these topicsInstallationArtreviewsShareReuse this content"

In the case of these two plays, which distil the experience of being a modern-day Palestinian under fire, it would seem to be humour, albeit pitch black and acid sharp.Staged as part ofPalArt festivalandShubbak festival, they deploy absurdism, satire and radical joy, swerving between the horrors to capture immense human resilience in the face of unspeakable suffering.Ahmed Masoud’s futuristic playApplication 39 (for the 2048 Gaza Summer Olympics)imagines Gaza in the year 2040. An online prank by two siblings (Joe Haddad and Sara Masry) has resulted in Gaza winning the Olympic bid. A political crisis ensues in a land which is now entirely controlled by Israel – they can turn the food “on and off” we hear, which contains clear echoes of the currentblockage of aidby Israel, resulting in the starvation of civilians. This future world is only in the first phase of a ceasefire and rubble from the 2025 conflict is still lying untouched.Adapted by the Palestinian playwright from a short story he wrote in 2018, and directed by Cressida Brown, it blends satire with discussions on how to live under occupation, to resist or submit, and the possibility of peace. Alongside this are dramatic accounts of the horrors on the ground in Gaza which chime loudly with the present day; the siblings enact their memories of 2025 – lying under rubble as petrified children whose family is dead, homes razed, and the land turned into a godforsaken place.There is little need to suspend disbelief as they recount what they see and experience: hospitals and ambulances destroyed, mothers scrambling in panic down flattened streets with their children, hospital directors arrested and detained without charge. Given Israel’s ban on allowing journalists into Gaza, these seem like the closest thing to witness testimonies, all the more so because Masoud, whose own family members have been killed in Gaza by Israeli forces, has collected real-life accounts and threaded his play through with those words. There are deeply poetic and reflective moments but also a prevailing sense of a play performed in real time, its suffering contemporaneous, its story real and raw.The Freedom Theatre’sReturn to Palestinehas had a far longer gestation period – it was devised almost a decade ago, although this is its UK premiere. The company’s general manager,Mustafa Sheta, was until recently held without charge by Israeli authorities and the theatre in Jenin, in the West Bank, is no longer accessible to its artists. Still they have produced a finessed and exquisitely tragicomic piece of physical theatre, with magnificent clowning.Directed by Micaela Miranda and based on real stories collected from across Palestine, it follows Jad, a Palestinian-American, on his first visit to the homeland. He is naive, excited to see his family, and wants a tour of the territory. Together, the superb six-strong cast (Motaz Malhees, Amir Abu Alrob, Ameena Adileh, Sofia Asir, Alaa Shehadeh and Osama Alazzeh) twist or stretch to become hooting cars, beds, tables, chairs, and the Statue of Liberty. It is visually poetic in the shapes and shadows they create, and both deadly serious and gloriously silly in tone.View image in fullscreenConfined space … Return to Palestine.Photograph: Zoë Birkbeck PhotographyJust as in Masoud’s play, there is minimal staging, constrained this time to a narrow white rectangle on a black stage – a metaphor for the confined yet still contested land left for Palestinians in the region? Everyone is satirised, from Israeli officials at the airport who are horrified by Jad’s Muslim surname to Americans boasting freedom (while aiding occupation) and comically garrulous Arabs.Sudden moments of pain inject a drama that moves through trauma and into a joy that feels deeply radical, heartwarming and filled with love. As Jad travels across the West Bank, he witnesses the dead-eyed administrative implacability of the checkpoint guards, the stark contrast between cramped Palestinian camps and the world of the settlers, as well as violence and death. An oud player and percussionist are sensational, heightening the comedy and tension.Both shows give the current state of conflict its historical context: they speak of the Nakba, violent occupation, illegal settlements, daily injustices and casual daily killings of Palestinian civilians. This is more than just theatre. It is art, activism, political resistance and storytelling – painful, joyous, elemental and essential.AtTheatro Technis, London, until 1 JuneExplore more on these topicsTheatrePalestinian territoriesPolitical theatreGazaActivismreviewsShareReuse this content"

There are a few debatable aspects toJack Furness’s ingeniously busy production andTom Piper’s mirror-dominated stage designs, and on the opening night it took time for the show to fully hit its musical stride. Overall, though, this is an overwhelmingly convincing staging of a genuine music drama, and it will surely come to be seen as one of Garsington’s most notable milestones.The opera’s 18th-century setting, following Pushkin’s short story, is retained. But in every other respect this is an unmistakably dark 21st-century reading. Furness is good at inserting troubling new details into the opera’s apparently sunnier moments, literally so when black curtains zip across the late afternoon Garsington windows. The children playing soldiers on the banks of the Neva are here more sinister than cute, while the costume ball scene is riddled with transgressive suggestion. Suffice to say that the grand entrance of Catherine the Great after the ball scene’s pastorale will not end as traditionalists will expect either.View image in fullscreenBrooding … Aaron Cawley as Hermann in Queen of Spades at Garsington Opera.Photograph: Clive BardaA successful performance of The Queen of Spades never rests solely on the shoulders of the opera’s tortured antihero Hermann. Tchaikovsky’s opera contains too many other fine cameos and ensembles for that. But without an outstanding Hermann, the opera’s uniquely visceral impact might misfire. Fortunately, Garsington has a true Hermann in its ranks, in the shape of the Germany-based Irish tenor Aaron Cawley, who sings the role with prodigious intensity, almost too agonisingly, and with a brooding Heathcliffian presence which at times threatens to eclipse everything else on stage.Yet this is as it should be. Hermann’s obsessive gambling, social awkwardness and sexual frustration are the dramatic focus of the opera in ways that look forward to the 20th century, to Berg’s unhappy Wozzeck and to Britten’s troubled loner Peter Grimes, a role for which Cawley would be ideal. Under Douglas Boyd’s baton, Tchaikovsky’s compulsive and innovative score, full of expressive woodwind detail and driven forwards by the march of fate, does the rest.Among the other principals,Laura Wildeis a suitably haunted and haunting Lisa, movingly depicting her character’s journey from security to despair. Stephanie Wake-Edwards is bright and characterful as her friend Polina. Diana Montague, as vocally elegant as ever, plays the aged Countess without hamming the role. Robert Hayward uses his many arts to give more depth to Hermann’s friend Tomsky than usual, while Roderick Williams does an eloquently sympathetic turn as the disappointed Prince Yeletsky.Until 4 JulyExplore more on these topicsOperaClassical musicreviewsShareReuse this content"

Now she is channelling those setbacks into a new album that’s ‘devastating, but in a fun way’Fri 30 May 2025 09.00 EDTShareRecently Shura decided she wanted to fight. Already in what she calls her Muscle Mummy era – partly inspired by the Kristen Stewart-starring, queer bodybuilding thriller Love Lies Bleeding – this buff new mindset involved the singer, songwriter and producer learning jujitsu for the video for World’s Worst Girlfriend, the soft-pop highlight of this month’s excellently titled third album, I Got Too Sad for My Friends.Things didn’t go to plan, however. In her fourth class, coming out of a roll, she felt her knee go pop. One MRI scan later, having feared a more serious ligament tear, she was diagnosed with a knee problem known as Hoffa’s fat pad impingement. It meanswe’re meeting in a cafe/record shop hybrid a few metres from the west London flat she shares with her girlfriend. She reminds me that last time we spoke, around the release of her 2016 major label debut, Nothing’s Real, she couldn’t move her neck. Being a pop artist, it seems, is bad for your health. “I played football [for Manchester City from under 11 to under 16 level], I played loads of sports and I’ve never had a serious injury – until now,” she says.Things have been emotionally painful, too. I Got Too Sad for My Friends was born out of the upside down of the pandemic, then slowly created after a severe bout of writer’s block, before being delayed by illness. But its title also encapsulates an aspect of Shura’s personality. “There’s a little sense of humour to it but, at the same time, if you examine it, it may be slightly devastating,” the 36-year-old smiles. “Devastating in a fun way.”The seeds of I Got Too Sad for My Friends’s creation started with its predecessor, Forevher, an album exploring queer love over airy 70s grooves that Shura feels didn’t get the shot it deserved. After its release in August 2019, its accompanying tour was cut short by Covid. At that time, Shura – real name Aleksandra Denton – was living in New York and too scared to leave the US in case she wasn’t allowed back in. She started to “pre-grieve” her parents back in London, specifically her mum, who is the subject of the new album’s emotional centrepiece, Online. “Worrying is my hobby,” Shura says, chewing some Nicorette gum (she’s been trying to give up vaping, which she started when she was giving up cigarettes). “I joke that if there’s something to worry about I’ll worry about it.”She searched hard for joy. When her musician friends started organising virtual concerts she figured she’d join in. She wanted to make it work, too, even rearranging the plants in her apartment for “vibes … but there were no vibes”. In the end, she gave up: “I was basically performing to a fucking fig tree.” Later, she’d find a better use of the internet as a streamer on gaming platform Twitch, lost in “the horniest game I’ve ever played in my life”, Baldur’s Gate 3 (“You can pick your character’s genitalia,” she says. “There’s three different penis options.”)It wasn’t just live music that was making her sad; suddenly all music was off the table. Performance was her job and every song was a reminder of what she was losing. Having previously been dropped by Polydor after Nothing’s Real failed to meet its commercial expectations, she also started taking on the weight of an industry in turmoil. “Also I just couldn’t write,” she says. “I had nothing to say. I would be talking to my partner going: ‘Maybe that’s all I will ever offer to the world.’ I think if that had been it, it would have been really sad because it was like I had one and a half goes.”Someone gives me money to make a record, then they’re like: Oh, that was a bad ideaShortly after releasing a deluxe version of Forevher in early 2021, and moving back to London, she was dropped again, this time by the indie label Secretly Canadian. Shura says she hadn’t been surprised at being dropped by Polydor, who signed her at the peak of music-blog influence, after her tactile, SoundCloud-only 2014 debut single Touch went viral. Having taught herself production via YouTube tutorials while working as a video editor, she found the major label ecosystem alienating and intimidating, and she was clearly an odd fit. When she was being touted around various labels, she remembers one asking her what her “thing” was. “They said: ‘Clean Bandit play classical instruments, so is your thing like: Hi, I’m in a beanie.’” She looks agog, pulling at her – you guessed it – beanie. In the end, after signing to Polydor, she decided her thing was being “stressed out”.The second, most recent, label departure – this time from an indie – stung, however. “I talk to my musician friends now and I’m like: ‘Look, if you’re dropped, come to me,’” she laughs. “That’s my expectation: someone gives me some money to make a record and then they’re like: ‘Oh that was a bad idea.’” She pauses. “But it was actually quite painful. Like, ‘By the way, I know it’s a bit of a pandemic and you have no income but, you know, bye.’”Shura’s ability to find solace in tricky times extends to the album’s sonic palette. While lyrically the album is saturated with the pandemic’s sense of uncanny – the single Richardson is about Shura taking laps round her small apartment “to feel the air on my face”, while other songs touch on loneliness, panic and dislocation – musically it feels like a warm hug. Recorded live with a small band, it leans into 60s Americana, all honeyed harmonies, rich organ and the gentle pitter-patter of drums. “Writing-wise,” she says, “I met myself where I was listening-wise.”It was the tactile songs of US singer-songwriter Cassandra Jenkins that helped Shura fall back in love with music. “It was the perfect record for that time,” she says of Jenkins’s intimate An Overview on Phenomenal Nature album. “I could curl up into it and it just comforted me.” Jenkins adds backing vocals to Richardson, and even makes a cameo in our interview when one of her songs gently wafts out of the cafe’s speakers. The perpetually fidgety Shura suddenly sits bolt upright. “Fuck off! She’s here. Cassandra, that’s so nice of you to turn up. Hi.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

The artwork for I Got Too Sad for My Friends finds Shura sitting on a rock in the Bannau Brycheiniog (Brecon Beacons), sporting armour over her everyday clothes and looking for a battle that never comes.It was semi-inspired by Baz Luhrmann’s Romeo + Juliet and how “a lot of lesbians of a certain age” either fancy its star Leonardo DiCaprio or “want to be him, or want to be a woman that looks like him”. The armour has a much bigger significance, too. “[During the pandemic] I found that I was doing stuff that I thought was protecting me from pain or sadness, that absolutely made things worse; by retreating, by reaching out to my friends less and isolating myself further. So here I am in armour, ready to fight, but what is my armour protecting?”As she starts to grow more animated, those gym-toned arms reveal a delicate sword tattoo in honour of the new record. She gets one for each album, she explains, which confuses me after I spot a drawing of a jolly, round character. “Oh, that’s just a happy potato,” she laughs. When I suggest she’s just let slip the title of album four, she smiles, and allows herself to look to a future she thought was gone: “It’s that or Hoffa’s fat pad impingement.”I Got Too Sad for My Friends is out now.Explore more on these topicsMusicPop and rockinterviewsShareReuse this content"

The scale and feel of it were unlike anything else. Complete escapism. I used to skate around the living room singing the songs.Andrzej Goulding (video designer and animator):It’s such a part of popular culture – Starlight Express is even referenced on Family Guy. But I didn’t know a huge amount about the musical aside from the fact that it was on roller-skates and it was trains.Tim Hatley (set designer):I was studying at Central Saint Martins in the 80s and went to see Starlight because its designer, John Napier, was coming in to do a project with us. We’d been doing Shakespeare but this was almost like a fairground ride. I mean, they high-fived the audience – some of whom had seen the show 50 times.Gabriella Slade (costume designer):People who saw Starlight when they were kids are now bringing their own families. In our audience you can be up close with some of these characters and costumes. That’s quite rare.View image in fullscreenNancy Wood (Buffy), Stephanie Lawrence (Pearl), Jeff Shankley (Greaseball), Frances Ruffelle (Dinah) and Chrissy Wickham (Ashley) in the original 1984 production of Starlight Express at the Apollo Victoria theatre, London.Photograph: Donald Cooper/AlamyTim Hatley:For those who saw it the first time round, we wanted to give it a different spin. With a flexible space like this, the world is your oyster. Do it in the round? Have it like a tennis court? We had lots of thoughts and lots of models. Everybody’s waiting on me to come up with the concept. Lighting, video, even skating and choreography – they can’t get on with their work until they know where the slopes are and how steep they are and where the video wall is.Gabriella Slade:The original Starlight is probably one of the most iconic shows of all time. From a design point of view, it’s just heaven. On a revival it’s important, I think, to reference what has been before to a degree – we wanted to continue that spirit but also, 40 years on, shape it for a new generation.Tim Hatley:We didn’t want to just copy what John had done before. And we didn’t want to be stuck with real trains running through tunnels and over bridges.Gabriella Slade:The brief is really tricky! In our early conversations, we talked about the core components of a train and how to present those in a costume for performers who need to be able to move as easily as possible and to fall safely. There was a lot of aerodynamic chat!View image in fullscreenJeevan Braich as Rusty and Kayna Montecillo as Pearl in Starlight Express.Photograph: Pamela RaithAndrzej Goulding:As soon as we landed on the idea of train tracks through space, where we’re sat as an audience became the race planet. There are other planets out there, like Electra’s and Greaseball’s. There’s no direction of that in the script. It’s completely left up to the team. References can come from anywhere but there’s that amazing 80s advert for Milky Way with the red car and the blue car where they’re kind of floating through the air. It’s that kind of world.Tim Hatley:With video gaming, what kids are used to now is very different to playing with the old Hornby train sets.Andrzej Goulding:I had a train set as a kid, one of those little wooden ones. You pretend they’re anything. Starlight was like mixing Mario Kart with trains and setting it in space. The reason you can go over the top is it’s the point of view of a child. Having the kid, Control, on stage is a bit of a masterstroke – you can do even more because they’re directing what happens. We’d often ask: What would a kid do in this situation?Gabriella Slade:We’re in a child’s bedroom – Control’s outfit had to look like it had been made at home or bought, or a hybrid of the two. The jumpsuit vibe felt right – a bit cosmic.Howard Hudson:We had to keep the childlike essence of the piece – this is a child’s imagination – while using such ultra-modern technology. So there are moments that are incredibly simple, like a single star flying in.Tim Hatley:There were three separate designs: auditorium, front of house and the show. As a theatre designer, you’re not usually governing where the audience are going to sit – or worried about where they are going to be coming in and out. With this, it was a priority.Gabriella Slade:First off, you read the script, listen to the music and collate research images. From there, you form sketches or initial shapes and start to think about fabrics. Then you go into much more fully rendered concept sketches integrating the fabrics. That, of course, is costed and there’s a process of research and development. We had a skate school for a number of weeks so were able to access our company quite early on for fittings. Some of the shapes are not form-fitting, so we needed to make sure they would be all right going around corners in the auditorium.View image in fullscreen‘The skaters had to get used to having mega bright lights in their eyes’ … Starlight Express.Photograph: Pamela RaithTim Hatley:I’m very old fashioned. I work with model boxes. We had an enormous one for this because there were so many collaborators who weren’t necessarily in the world of theatre, but also because it was a space that didn’t really exist yet. So people needed to understand the auditorium.Howard Hudson:The skaters had to get used to having mega bright lights in their eyes as they try to navigate these routes around the space. There are more than 600 moving lights in the show, which has probably one of the biggest rigs for a musical. For the Starlight sequence in act two we have 250 of these star units that fly above the audience – each has got six LEDs on it. Then there’s however many kilometres of LED tape.Tim Hatley:We’ve got LED set into the floor and the skaters go over that. It’s not like using the old tungsten lights which got very hot, but it does warm up, which causes the plastic on top to expand. So there was a lot of development. I was able to give Howard places to put lights where you normally wouldn’t have them, like coming up through the floor. It became clear to me that it needed a rock concert feel. The songs were rearranged to have a more contemporary, poppy sound too.View image in fullscreenJade Marvin as Momma in Starlight Express.Photograph: Pamela RaithHoward Hudson:Early on, we built a pre-visualisation studio with huge screens and had a 3D version of the set on a computer. Andrzej was able to feed his content into that and we had the whole rig there. So we would watch actors rehearse a number then go into our studio and work out how to light it.Andrzej Goulding:Lighting and video are closely intertwined because there’s only so many photons you can throw on stage. Howard and I have worked together several times. The Starlight rehearsal room had a full set and the two of us sat there tracking the race, drawing a map of what goes where. The hardest thing in theatre, compared with film, is that an audience can look anywhere. Our job is to pull the attention of the observer. We used a live camera in the races to help follow the characters. And we used a leaderboard. It took us a long time just to sculpt the journey of those races.Tim Hatley:For the ramps, we talked to skaters who had been in the show before. How do we get that amount of speed up in that amount of space? Those were technical problems which were all new to me. We collaborated with a company that builds skate ramps and parks. It’s a timber surface – we’ve used some metallic paints in there too, to pick up the video. We’ve got moving scenery but where those joins are the surfaces have to be perfect and seamless. You can’t have any little gaps that might get worse during the run.Andrzej Goulding:Video design should only be there if it’s serving the story. If you’re just doing something for the sake of looking fun, it weirdly makes things slower. There’s also only so much spectacle you can do. A show is all about peaks and troughs, following the storytelling. If you’re peaking the entire time, it’s boring.View image in fullscreenAnother layer of spectacle … Tom Pigram as Electra in Starlight Express.Photograph: Pamela RaithHoward Hudson:Luke [Sheppard, the show’s director] has the most technical mind. I’m convinced he could be a lighting designer if he wanted to. We’ve collaborated for years and have developed a kind of shorthand – we started out at the Finborough and now work on these massive commercial musicals together. Set designers build models and costume designers do drawings whereas lighting is so visceral. You need to see the lights in the space, so we’re always the last people to come in. And we’re doing our job in front of 150 people in the theatre. So it’s a bit nervy.Gabriella Slade:It was important to make sure that each group of characters had a visual identity: carriages, trucks, steam engines, electric trains. They needed to feel cohesive when put together but have differentiations as well. Campbell Young and Helen Keane were our wigs and hair designers and Jackie Saundercock was our makeup designer. We had a brilliant collaborative relationship. The integration of the hair and makeup feels like one unit, which is always the aim. Each character has their own iconography, too. The designs need to be bold enough for you to identify who’s who and where they are in the races.Howard Hudson:For Electra’s song AC/DC we wanted laser units to give a quality of light you don’t get from normal fixtures. We went down to a laser company and spent a day experimenting with the looks we could get. It almost comes out of nowhere in the show and adds another layer of spectacle you don’t get out of a traditional lighting unit.View image in fullscreen‘A lovely extension of the image’ … Al Knott as Greaseball with the spark gun.Photograph: Pamela RaithGabriella Slade:The backpacks have handles, which are important for racing together. For me, the backpacks suggest a power bank or a battery – and they light up so actually have their own batteries! It’s all an extension of the actual costume. Greaseball’s spark gun creates another really lovely extension of the image. It’s got the same yellow and black scheme and that moment really fits the energy of her song.Howard Hudson:We couldn’t use traditional manual followspots because people are moving so quickly. So we use an automated system called Zactrack. Performers wear tags that send tracking data to the lighting desk, and we’re able to tell the lights which person to follow around the space.Andrzej Goulding:Video is slow. Every time we want to do something, it’s got to be rendered. We’ve got all these multiple layers. You’ve got to put in a lot of hours. I’ll sit up until three in the morning if I’m not happy with one little thing. I just want to make sure it’s right. The scale of it was enormous. I tend to work on my own but got the biggest team I’ve ever had on a show. If you surround yourself with the right people it’s fun to do. And super satisfying when everything’s working in synergy.View image in fullscreenBackstage at the Royal Albert Hall, London, for the Olivier awards where Starlight Express won best costume design.Photograph: David Levene/The GuardianHoward Hudson:Whenever I go in and see it again, I think: Crikey, how on earth did we achieve that?Tim Hatley:There’s not a bad seat in the house, and they’re all very different. I don’t think I’ve designed a show where that has been the case so much. Sitting in what we call the side tracks, looking down, you’re very close. If you’re at the back, you get the whole overview and a real sense of the video.Gabriella Slade:Some fans come in costume. It’s so lovely to have people recreate the designs. I’m never not amazed that they want to spend the time to do that.Andrzej Goulding:The craziest thing was going on to do a “normal” show afterwards – one without people on roller skates!

The outre star of millennial self-satire Search Party and sidekick to the brilliantKate Berlant, Early has spent his career perfectly situated where generational social commentary meets flamboyant silliness. At his best tonight, he richly delivers on the expectation. And even if his best doesn’t sustain from start to finish, in the first half, when the Tennessee man addresses himself to frightened, vacuous, deracinated American modernity, he’s riveting.What’s interesting about Early’s approach is that – unlike Berlant,Leo Reich, and others – he doesn’t hide behind a character, or a grotesque version of himself. What we get is seemingly the real Early, larking around, sending up his own prissiness a little, but sharing observations on culture and its discontents that are strikingly idiosyncratic and unmistakably his own. Maybe some of the topics are familiar (pretentious food presentation in restaurants, say), but Early’s way of digging beneath them into richer cultural subsoil is distinctive. There’s a great routine about circumlocutory waiter-speak, and what it says about our fear of directness. Another skit about visiting the toilet while in company is both a goofy piece of self-mockery and a weirdly eloquent delve into shame and carnality in the era of the curated self.I make it sound heavy; it isn’t. Early is always on to the next thing, which is often outrageous and uproarious, like his routine about overinvesting in sexual role-play. (“I went full Meryl on his ass!”) All of this is punctuated by covers of pop hits by the likes of Madonna, Britney and – in a lovely closing duet with his musical wingman Hess – Dolly Parton. The songs aren’t always as gripping as the comedy. There’s a fairly basic audience participation interlude, and a sketch in character as denim-clad southern mom Vicky with a V that’s diverting, but lower-wattage than what’s gone before. It all adds up to a great show, though: entertaining in lots of ways and electrifying in some.Explore more on these topicsComedyJohn EarlyreviewsShareReuse this content"

I’ve now used nearly 3mGary DuschlFri 30 May 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 30 May 2025 11.10 EDTShareI don’t know what to put it down to, but I’ve always been a collector, a completist, a statistician – and maybe a little competitive.As a schoolboy in Canada, I was fascinated by the Guinness Book of Records and Ripley’s Believe It Or Not!. I would memorise the records and amaze my friends by quoting them.Little did I know then that in 1994 I would break a world record and feature in the book I adored as a young boy, all thanks to my childhood hobby – making paper chains out of chewing-gum wrappers.I learned how to do it in 1965, aged 14, after seeing the older kids in the playground folding their gum wrappers into neat, long chains. I took to it pretty quickly, and entered a competition to see who could make the longest in the class. I won that, and then I made the longest one in the school.Suddenly, all the kids in my neighbourhood were saving their gum wrappers for me to add to my chain. They even captioned my 1967 yearbook photo: “Got any gum wrappers?”I never realised how unique my chain was until almost 25 years later. In 1992, my wife, Deborah, and I were visiting the Ripley’s museum in Ontario. We saw a giant gum-wrapper chain hanging from the ceiling as part of one of the exhibits. As we stared up at it, we were both thinking the same thing: my chain is much bigger.Deborah nudged me and said: “You’d better do something about that.”Experience: I own nearly 3,000 VHS tapes of TitanicRead moreI spoke to the manager, and he put me in touch with Ripley’s vice-president of acquisitions. He was impressed by my chain, but told me there was a Guinness World Record holder who had a longer one.My competitive nature kicked in. I went to the Wrigley’s purchasing department and asked them to supply me with Juicy Fruit wrappers – my favourite flavour. They gave me 5,000 to begin with, then 10,000 more. Before long, I blew past the 7,400ft (2.25km) record and reached 10,000ft.I became the Guinness World Record holder for the longest gum wrapper chain in the world – at 12,105ft – in March 1994, and I have officially broken my own record eight times since.So far, no one has come close to beating me. The second-longest chain I’m aware of belongs to a fellow in Germany whose chain is 17,000ft. I connect with other chain-makers via mywebsiteand I call them my “chain gang”. There are roughly 50 of us and we share photos of our chains and the lengths we’ve reached.According to the latest official measurement, my chain is 23.226 miles (37.4km) long. Getting the chain measured is quite an undertaking. Every five years, land surveyors come over, and two witnesses have to independently verify the length. It takes many hours. In March this year, they recorded that my chain was made of 2,963,789 wrappers.There have been plenty of exciting moments since I started 60 years ago. For example, when I reached the 10-mile mark, I was featured in a book calledWeird Virginiaand they dubbed me the “World’s Greatest Wrap Artist”.

It was such a thrilling day. I got my brother-in-law to help me load the chain into a van and drive it all the way to the city, where we set it up in a big auditorium in front of all the cameras.Recently, I learned I was a hit onTikTok– a video about me got 7.5m views. Some people wrote: “Get a life! What is wrong with you?” To that, I say: I have a life. I’m retired now but I had a successful career as an operations manager of four businesses, which took me all over the world, including to the Philippines, Puerto Rico and Germany. I am a busy and fulfilled person.One day, I’d love to be able to say my chain is as long as a marathon (26.2 miles) – I’m only three miles off. After that, it would be poetic to reach 28 miles, which is the length of Virginia beach in the US, where I’ve lived with my wife since 2002. It’s the largest pleasure beach in the world.The chain will keep growing as long as my hands keep working. To have something to show for your time on this earth is very gratifying.As told to Lara OlszowskaDo you have an experience to share?

I’m not normally one to jump on to viral trends, but I couldn’t resist trying this one. The dough is pretty easy, with no kneading or stand mixer required – just some stretching, folding and plenty of time to rest. You end up with something that tastes like a cinnamon bun/doughnut hybrid, that’s not too sweet and with a little more chew.Glazed cinnamon focacciaPrep5 minProve3 hr+Cook1 hr 15 minServes12-16For the dough450g breadflour7g instant yeast2 tbsp sugar1 tsp fine sea salt30ml olive oil, plus extra for greasingFor the cinnamon sugar3½ tsp cinnamon50g caster sugar50g unsalted butter,meltedFor the glaze3 tbsp icing sugar¼ tsp cinnamon2 tspwhole milkA pinch of saltPut the flour, yeast, sugar, and salt in the bowl of a stand mixer, and mix to combine. Make a well in the centre, pour in 360ml lukewarm water and the olive oil, and mix briefly to make a shaggy dough.Still in the bowl, and using a slightly wet hand, pull one corner of the dough from underneath, stretch and fold it to the centre, then turn the dough 90 degrees. Repeat the stretch, fold and turn three more times.Cover the bowl with clingfilm or a damp tea towel, and leave to rest for 30 minutes. Repeat the stretch and fold process, let it rest for another 30 minutes, then stretch and fold repeat again.In a small bowl, mix the cinnamon and sugar. Sprinkle half of this on top of the dough, then do one more set of stretch and folds. Sprinkle a little more cinnamon sugar on top, then cover the dough and prove for an hour to an hour and a half, until nearly doubled in size.Generously grease a 30cm x 22cm baking tin with olive oil, then tip in the dough. Using your fingertips, gently stretch out the dough to fill the pan (don’t worry if it springs back), then cover and put in a warm place and leave to rest for another 30 minutes.Heat the oven to 230C (210C fan)/450F/gas 8. Pour the melted butter on to the surface of the dough and sprinkle with the remaining cinnamon sugar. Use your fingertips to dimple the dough, then bake for 20-25 minutes, until well browned and puffy. Remove from the oven and cool for 10 minutes.Make the glaze by mixing the icing sugar, cinnamon, milk and salt. Drizzle this generously over the warm focaccia and serve.Explore more on these topicsBakingThe sweet spotFoodDessertCakeBreadItalian food and drinkSnacksrecipesShareReuse this content"

He has a breakfast of two boiled eggs, some protein, vegetables and fruit, and by 6am or 7am he’s out at the beach or local stadium near his home in Rayong province, training with his 73-year-old daughter Siripan.He will walk between 1km and 2km before doing a quick 100m run, once or twice. Then, he practises one of his other sports: javelin, discus or shot put.Sawang’s training regime has proven effective – just last week, he won four golds at the World Masters Games in Taiwan. He was, media reports remarked, in a league of his own at the event – as the oldest competitor at the games and the only person in his age group, he was almost certain to win the men’s 100-plus discus, javelin, shot put and 100m, which he completed in 38.55 seconds.What’s the secret to his longevity and success? “Regular exercise, healthy food, staying in a good mood, always being calm, breathing clean air and keeping up good hygiene,” he says. “If I’m sick, I go to see the doctor.”Sawang has always loved sports, watching it on TV or at local competitions. “I like to watch boxing, and my favourite is Pone Kingpetch,” he says, referring to Thailand’s first world boxing champion, who retired in the 1960s.It was not until Sawang turned 97 that he began competing. He was inspired by Siripan, an athlete with the Thai VeteranAthleticsAssociation, who would bring her father along to watch her compete at events. “He started to like the atmosphere because he could make new friends and see new people. He saw that even though the people involved were 60-, 70- or 75-year-old athletes, they were still able to participate,” says Siripan.View image in fullscreenSawang competed in the 100-plus age group at the World Masters Games in Taiwan, going on to win four gold medals.Photograph: I-Hwa Cheng/AFP/Getty ImagesAt first, Sawang’s family worried that the travel required for competitions may be too tiring. But 21 games and 78 medals later, it has all gone well, Siripan says.There are days when he feels a bit lethargic, says Sawang with a laugh, but the sight of his daughter heading out normally spurs him on. “If I notice that he looks a bit tired, we just do walking, no jogging, or any other form of practice,” says Siripan. Going outside, and being active, has benefits beyond physical fitness. “I can see that he looks refreshed when he sees other people. It’s only two of us in the house, and it’s better to keep going out,” she adds.Sawang likes to eat vegetables andnam prikpao– a spicy dipping sauce made with chillies, shallots, garlic, dried shrimp and fish sauce – as well asgaeng liang, a vegetable soup, andgaeng som, a spicy and sour fish curry with rice. He rarely eats pork, and mostly sticks to vegetables and fish.Siripan explains that they eat healthily and that the air quality is good near to the beach where they exercise. Her father also keeps up a positive attitude, he adds. “If he gets sick or needs to take medicine, he’s never stubborn about it.”She believes the main barrier preventing older people in Thailand from exercising is a lack of support. “They don’t want to do it alone, and especially for elderly people, they need help and assistance,” she says. Thailand is considered an ageing society, with 20% of the population more than 60 years old.“Elderly people especially can get quite lonely at home – their children or relatives are out at work, so they stay home all day alone,” she says. Exercise can “make them feel lively again”.She hopes her father’s success will inspire others. “When I look at the comments on social media, I see a lot of positive responses. People are saying ‘Grandpa is so great’ and that they wanted to be fit as Grandpa,” she says. “I am very happy, and I’m very proud of my dad – that he stays strong and he has the discipline to keep fit. I know that he doesn’t want to be a burden to our family,” says Siripan, who also won two gold medals and a silver in Taiwan.Both Sawang and Siripan plan to take a few days off after their success, but will get stuck into training again next week. They are already gearing up to qualify for the 23rd Asia Masters Athletics Championships, which will be held in India in November.“I want everyone to start exercising so they will be strong and not getting sick,” says Sawang.His advice to others who want to get fit? “If you go out to exercise with friends, you will get a chance to know them more – and it’s fun.”Explore more on these topicsThailandOlder peopleHealthAthleticsAsia PacificfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Sat by the fire, he addresses his students.“This is not a wellness retreat. It is about getting out of your comfort zone.”I am in the Camden bush, on Dharawal and Gundungurra Country, for a four-day wilderness survival course taught by the consultant forTV’s most gruelling show, Alone Australia.On the itinerary: knife work, knots, emergency shelters, fire lighting, water collection, plant identification, solar and celestial navigation, plus emergency signalling and rescue techniques. On my person: fresh hiking boots, gold hoops, perfectly low-rise cargo pants and a black tee.The last time I went camping was with school in year 9, in a tent set up about 50 steps from a cabin. Out of my comfort zone, indeed – this time I don’t have a tent, or a toilet.After a short hike, we arrive at sunset to a large green tarp billowing gently. It’s a military parachute, Dedman tells us. We gather at a semicircle of stools beneath the canopy.View image in fullscreenThe bush skills class taking place under the military parachute.Photograph: Rafqa ToumaDedman gets straight to it. The goal of “survival” is to be found, he says. This isdifferent to bushcraft, which has a direct relationship with nature and draws from the skills traditional cultures used to live in the wilderness.Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morningDedman’s philosophy about the land and people’s role on it is clear just a few hours in: “Our existence here is based on the caring capacity of the Earth.“But we live in a system of expanding expenditure … at total odds with nature. Something is very broken with our system.”We go around the circle of 15 students, introducing ourselves. Most of us are novices, mainly Sydney and Canberra-based men with office jobs looking to reconnect with the outdoors (participant Julian Carrick says he is here to “soothe the soul” and “see the stars”) plus two parents, their eager sons and myself.Some students have dabbled in survival and bushcraft for years – including Karla Pound, a National Geographic expedition leader and contestant on the current season of Alone.View image in fullscreenAlone Australia season 3 contestant Karla Pound joined the course: ‘It is really important to have these basic, fundamental skills under your belt.’Photograph: Rafqa ToumaWe’re not equipped for when things go wrong, she tells me. She says even during common occurrences such as power outages and floods, “people don’t know the first thing to do”.“It is really important to have these basic, fundamental skills under your belt.”The parachute tarp becomes our base for the next four days, with classes held early in the morning and late at night. These hours are by design, to simulate the exhaustion and distraction one might feel in a real survival situation. Meanwhile our days are structured around practical skills.First, knives (I’m limp-wristed and slow), then knots (I actually catch on). We use both to set up our first emergency shelters – pitched plastic sheets strung up between two trees and secured with pegs we carved ourselves, totally open to the surrounds. These structures are called hootchies.View image in fullscreenRafqa Touma with her ‘hootchie’ emergency shelter.Photograph: Rafqa ToumaI am slow to find a spot – too picky, terrified of sleeping near thick shrubbery. It’s a justified fear, I’d say, given we are in the habitat of funnel web spiders, king brown and red belly black snakes.By the time I choose a location, the sun is setting. I fumble in the dark, trying to hold all my ropes and pegs in place. It is only thanks to kind peers – a physio and a former-detective-turned-teacher – that I am able to set up in time for dinner.“The western world has a problem with food aversion,” Dedman says at meal time. So true. I’m hungry for the potato cooking under the bonfire coals we are sitting around.We waste so much, he says, we’re disconnected from our food’s sources. I nod when he mentions more sustainable protein alternatives to beef.Then he brings out a container of live meal worms. We are going to eat them, he says. I laugh. Classic Dedman!My head torch lights up the plump, yellow bodies writhing in the container and visceral anxiety floods my stomach. “Fussy people die.”After several failed attempts, I get the worms into my mouth.They wriggle around my fingers. They thrash against my lips. They burst between my teeth, and the group applauds. I actually enjoy the taste. This will forever be my greatest feat. I am overcome with relief!But Dedman has leftovers.View image in fullscreenPotatoes baking in the fire.Photograph: Rafqa ToumaI was too hesitant, he tells me. I can will myself to do anything, he says. Eat more.I manage to eat a second squirming helping and then Dedman lets me be.

The insects are jumping. My hands are shaking. A course instructor suggests I try breathing.“It’s twitching in the fire!” the 12-year-old observes. I realise if I’m actually caught out in the bush I’ll likely perish because I can’t catch, behead and eat a cricket. An instructor does it for me.Ever since being attacked by a swarm of seagulls on a beach, I’ve been a little jumpy around animals. I start overthinking my impending night’s sleep – what if I wake up to a snake in my sleeping bag?But on a midnight walk to learn celestial navigation before bed, my thoughts are interrupted when we turn off our torches and look up.The air is crisp, the surrounds are silent and the sky glimmers. Fear is replaced by cool, calm peace. I have a great night’s sleep.View image in fullscreenPreparing a hearty meal of kangaroo stew.Photograph: Rafqa ToumaThe next day we learn to make fire with our knife and a ferro rod, and purify creek water. While learning about local flora on a bush walk, Dedman throws impromptu challenges at us – five minutes to gather tinder and kindle and start a fire.All this skill-building has been working us up to the task of our third night – finding an ally or two, scoping out a safe spot and setting up an emergency base. I turn to my new friends Daniel and Damien and we set off, racing against our faux competition who have their sights set on the same campsite.We string up our reflective blankets at a tilt between two trees, light a fire, filter our creek water and prepare a hearty meal of kangaroo stew.View image in fullscreenEmergency shelter for the third night.Photograph: Rafqa ToumaWe eat and chat beneath the night sky and I start to feel a little sad. This place is so beautiful and tomorrow I have to go home.“I mean, just look around you,” Carrick, a peer on the course, said earlier in the day. “This place is heaven right here. You don’t need to look any further.”Wine and wilderness: a multi-day hike in South Australia’s Clare ValleyRead moreHow not to dieDedman’s lessons differ depending on the environment. Here are a few general takeaways for when you are lost or stranded.Mindset is important. Panic is dangerous and can affect those around you. You need to be able to plan, act and hold the will to live.Make sure you think throughyour survival priorities. The rule of threes is governed by what will harm you first: you can survive just three minutes without air, three days without water and three weeks without food.Follow the PLAN acronym: protection (first aid, clothing, shelter, fire), location (attracting, holding and directing attention), acquisition (of water, then food) and navigation (orientation, travel, direction).When going anywhere remote, ensure you can be found. Have a satellite communication device like an EPIRB (emergency position-indicating radiobeacon) on you. Also take stock of everything you have that can attract attention in the natural environment – shiny, bright and reflective materials. You can set these up between trees as a method of passive signalling, fly a bright flag at the end of a big stick, or make a ground-to-air sign with letters. “V” is the international emergency distress symbol. A ground to air sign has to be 6m x 3m to be seen by a passing aerial vehicle or satellite.Search efforts are conducted in patterns. Aircraft will do a box search at the height they can see an animal move. A ground search will follow a track, a river, or man-made things such as telecommunication towers and windmills. Contour searches of mountains are conducted by circling. If you know these patterns, you can set your signalling to capitalise on where you will most likely be seen.Find more in depth advice on theBushcraft Survival Australia blog.The detailsThe three-day fundamentals module 1 course costs $855 for an adult, or $427.50 for a child (aged 12 and up).

Yes, it can mean some adaptation, but when so many things are on your doorstep it’s not such a big challenge. So how about car-free life in a remote Italian mountain village, with barely any public transport?We have been living in rural Italy without a car for more than five years now. Even though we have always loved bicycles, the decision to sell our car wasn’t a particularly considered one.It all started with our fear over the climate crisis and environmental issues, which prompted us to drawa massive bicycle across the map of Europea few years ago in an attempt to persuade people to use their cars a bit less.We succeeded in at least one regard, because we persuaded ourselves we could live without a car completely.Previously, we owned a VW Golf that was quite nice and super-reliable. As with most people, we depended on it for all sorts of essential and non-essential trips: shopping, doctors’ appointments, trips to the garden centre or dump, walks in the mountains – pretty much everything.We had lived as a couple without a car before, but we were younger, we didn’t have a dog, and we lived in big cities. Now, we live in a small Italian village in the foothills of the Alps, where public transport is close to non-existent and what there is is highly unreliable.Most of our extended family were against the idea, and perhaps with some justification.Cyclingin rural Italy is not particularly easy, as there is very little cycling infrastructure and drivers do not give cyclists enough space on the road. We weren’t (and still aren’t) particularly dedicated cyclists.View image in fullscreenDaniel Rayneau-Kirkhope heads out for supplies with his dog.Photograph: Arianna CasiraghEven if it is fair to say that we sold the car without thinking through the consequences too much, there were early signs that this wasn’t the most stupid thing we had done.The sense of freedom and happiness in those first few trips was empowering. We felt we had managed to stop letting society dictate what we had to have and what we didn’t, at least regarding our transport choices.And over time, we have found that there is a car-free solution to almost every logistical problem, with just a little bit of planning – and a few bikes. For the grocery shopping, we use an electric cargo bike – hauling 50kg of food uphill without a motor would be enough to make extreme dieting seem attractive.To take the dog for a walk, we use a non-electric cargo bike. You get to the paths pretty fast, and then the dog can walk while you cycle. For trips to Milan, Turin or Novara, a combination of train, bus and folding bike works well.We’ve taken pretty much everything on our cargo bikes, from small olive trees and manure for our vegetable patch to kayaks and building supplies. Trips to the mountains are still tricky, though.Quite often it takes longer to go by bike, but time can be saved with a bit of organisation. Going to the gym by bike means you don’t need to warm up once you arrive. Commuting and exercising at the same time is certainly a time saver.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

People can say hello as you pass and we feel more like we are part of a community. There is also nothing like a good bike ride to help you clear your thoughts and feel better psychologically.Simple trips, even the most boring of errands, have become a bit more adventurous and fun.

Life got in the way. By the time I was able to get stuck in, my veg patch was busily filling up with plants that had found their own way there. Now, I’m firmly in the camp of those who believe a weed is simply a plant that’s not where we’d like it to be. Our growing spaces and the creatures that dwell in them benefit from the gardeners who are able to live with some uninvited plants.That said, my veg patch had become something of a wilderness and, while there are plenty of so-called weeds I am happy to host, some had to go if I was to grow the edible plants I love this year.First on the chopping block was creeping buttercup. Both pollinators and I adore their flowers, but with their capacity to spread by throwing out runners and tentacle-like roots, they had covered half a vegetable bed and the paths around it. Its botanical name,Ranunculus repens, describes its horizontal growth habit –repensbeing the Latin for creeping.Couch grass can regrow from any segment of rhizome left behind, so ousting them is a Sisyphean taskAnother plant with the same creeping moniker is the perennial couch grassElymus repens, which also spreads through the soil by developing a tangle of roots and underground stems from which wide blades of grass emerge. While not an issue in the wilder parts of my garden – and welcomed by moths and butterflies when in flower, and as food for some larvae – its rampant spread needs curtailing in my veg patch. Unearthing its cable-like roots and rhizomes, or underground stems, can be disruptive but, by approaching it slowly and steadily, they can be ousted without too much soil disturbance. It’s a Sisyphean task, though, as couch grass can regrow from any segment that’s left behind.Now is the perfect time to sow broccoli seeds and create your own purple patchRead moreNext up, dock. This is another species needed by a plethora of insects yet, as each plant develops a hefty tap root and can produce thousands of seeds that remain viable in soil for years, docks need to go! Excavation can be messy, so I’m careful to replace the soil when the job is done.Last, any ephemeral plants – those that can move through a full lifecycle several times a season, such as chickweed, bittercress and groundsel – can be easily removed by hand or hoe. They’re not of huge concern, but their ability to reproduce at pace is not something I want to encourage.Most of these so-called weeds grow near the wire fence around my patch. Beyond this is a field filled with these plants in flower and the insects that feast on them. So I have to contend with uninvited plants every year, but can be sure that considered weeding won’t unduly affect the ecosystem. If that were not so, I’d probably hand over more of my garden to these often beneficial, if over-zealous interlopers.Explore more on these topicsGardening adviceGardensHobbiesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It’s ‘Indigenous people, you’re important – but not right now’. That’s a strategy of settler colonialism too,” said David MacDonald, a political science professor at Guelph University in Ontario from Treaty 4 lands in Regina, Saskatchewan.Canada was formed to promote unity among British colonial territories and to stop American expansion – and it was created through genocidal violence against Indigenous people, said MacDonald.“We need to be careful not to fall back into those historical patterns, because it’s pretty easy for a lot of settler Canadians to think that’s the way it has been and should be, especially if we appeal to older historical figures,” he said.Indigenous leaders also highlighted the irony of such high-profile declarations of Canadian sovereignty when First Nations are themselves forced to make similar assertions to Canada’s own federal government.Canada’s federal governmentadmits that colonial effortsto forcefully assimilate Indigenous peoples, and the displacement of First Nations on to inhospitable reserves have all contributed to shorter life expectancy, poverty and illness.View image in fullscreenFirst Nations leaders look on before Britain’s King Charles III delivers a speech from the Throne to open the first session of the 45th parliament of Canada, in Ottawa on 27 May.Photograph: Victoria Jones/AFP/Getty ImagesIndigenous communities have repeatedly been forced to turn to the courts in order to force the federal government to meet its obligations under centuries-old treaties between First Nations and the Crown.In one case last year, Canada’s highest court ruled that the crown had made a “mockery” ofa 1850 agreementby failing to adequately compensate First Nations for the riches extracted from their ancestral territories.“We were sovereign. We still are sovereign. And you have to respect that we enter these treaties to make sure that we share land and resources – and therefore Canada, the colonial state, must share revenue as well,” said Chief David Monias, of Pimicikamak Okimawin in Manitoba, at a press conference following the King’s speech.Grand Chief Kyra Wilson of the Assembly of Manitoba Chiefs welcomed the King’s decision to mention Indigenous rights, meet and acknowledge that Canada’s parliament building sits on traditional Algonquin territory.But she added: “There was talk of truth and reconciliation. But … we’ve heard the term ‘reconciliation’ for years now,” she says. “And what we are expecting – and what we’ve been expecting for years – is tangible action.”National Chief Cindy Woodhouse Nepinak, who is head of the Assembly of First Nations, said that during her meeting with the king she stressed the need for “less colonialism”.“People don’t like this [US] colonialism that’s happening at the borders,” she said. “But first nations have been feeling that for a long time: colonialism trying to dictate our lives.”Over the past 20 years, Canada has engaged in a fitful reckoning with its colonial past, with a 2015 report from the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) concluding that the country had engaged in a “cultural genocide” in which tens of thousands of First Nations children were forcibly removed from their families and incarcerated in residential schools rife with abuse.A major shift in public discourse also came four years ago this week,when over 200 potential burial sites of childrenwere confirmed outside a former residential school in southern British Columbia.Trump’s comments on Canada prompt surge of patriotism – in a Canadian wayRead moreBut that historical reassessment has been drowned out bya surge of nationalism in response to Trump– often invoking the iconography of British colonialism, said Rowland Keshena Robinson, an assistant professor of political science at the University of Waterloo in Ontario, who is a member of the Menominee Nation of Wisconsin.On the day of Charles’ speech, the Ontario government announced that a statue of John A Macdonald, Canada’s first prime minister, would be put back on public display, five years after activiststhrew paint on itto highlight Macdonald’s effortsto eliminate Indigenous peopleincluding through starvation.“There absolutely has been a backsliding in reconciliation in the last five years,” Robinson said.MacDonald argued that Canadians face a unique opportunity to define themselves as different from the US not through loyalty to Britain but through by enacting true reconciliation with Indigenous people.“What’s the opposite of a dictatorial, authoritarian presidential system? It’s a decentralized system where Indigenous people have control over their own lands, waters and keep large corporations from digging everything up,” he said.“That would be the most anti-American thing a Canadian could do,” he said. “If the narrative could change Indigenous self-determination could be a central part of Canadian identity.”This article was amended on 30 May 2025. An earlier version misspelled the first name of Kyra Wilson. Also, a photo caption of First Nations leaders incorrectly referred to them as being Inuit leaders. A reference to the 2021 discovery of the remains of 215 children has also been changed to reflect that these were potential burial sites, not remains.Explore more on these topicsCanadaKing Charles IIIIndigenous peoplesAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

In 2023, the Pentagon’s operations and installations generated about 48 megatons of carbon dioxide equivalent (MtCO2e) – more planet-warming gases than emitted by entire countries including Finland, Guatemala and Syria that year.Nato’s 2023 military spending produced about 233m metric tonnes of CO2 – reportRead moreNow, once again, the US military carbon footprint is on the cusp of rising significantly as Trump upends the old geopolitical order in his second presidency. In the first 100 days of his second term, Trump threatened military action in Panama, Greenland, Mexico and Canada, dropped bombs on Yemen and increased military sales to Israel, which has intensified its military assault on Gaza, the West Bank, Yemen and Lebanon.Trump has also aligned the US with former adversaries including Russia, while hurling direct or thinly veiled threats at former allies including Ukraine and the entire Nato alliance.Relations with Chinahave sunk amid Trump’s chaotic trade war.“If Trump follows through with his threats, US military emissions will absolutely rise, and this will cause a ripple effect,” said Crawford, author of the book The Pentagon, Climate Change, and War: Charting the Rise and Fall of US Military Emissions.View image in fullscreenNeta Crawford is an expert in military doctrine and peace buildingPhotograph: Rose Crawford“We’re already seeing lots of escalatory rhetoric, with fewer off-ramps and less commitment to resolving conflicts. The allies or former allies of the US have increased their military spending, so their emissions will go up. As adversaries and potential adversaries of the United States increase their military activity, their emissions will go up. It’s very bad news for the climate.”Emissions from Israel’s war in Gaza have ‘immense’ effect on climate catastropheRead moreThe Pentagon is the largest single fossil fuel consumer in the US, already accounting for about 80% of all government emissions. In March, the defence secretary,Pete Hegseth, wrote on X: “The @DeptofDefense does not do climate change crap. We do training and warfighting.”Trump has promised $1tn in defence spending for 2026 – which if approved by Congress would represent a 13% rise on the 2025 Pentagon budget amidunprecedented cutsto almost every other federal agency, including those thatresearch and respond to the climate crisis. His military ambitions sit alongside orders to terminate climate research at the Pentagon and a broader assault on climate action across government, while also taking steps to boost fossil fuel extraction.“No one spends like the US on the military and they want to spend even more. If they neglect education, health and infrastructure and their economy weakens, they will get paranoid about rivals, let’s say China, and this fear will cause even more spending. It’s an escalatory downward spiral, which often doesn’t end well – especially for the country doing the escalating,” said Crawford.“Of course, it depends on what they do and how they do it, and the DoD may slow-roll some of this, because it is, frankly, provocative, stupid and unnecessary, but we’re going exactly the wrong way. Emissions go up in step with military spending, and this is exactly the wrong time to do this.”In 2024, worldwide military expenditure had its steepest rise since the end of the cold war, reaching $2.7tn as wars and rising tensions drove up spending, according to arecent reportby the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute.US military spending – and emissions – are both the highest in the world, by a long way. And it is thanks to the US that states are not required to account for military emissions to the UN. In the run-up to the Kyoto protocol, the 1997 international treaty that set binding targets for greenhouse gas reductions, the Pentagon lobbied the Bill Clinton White House to push for a blanket exemption for emissions generated by military fuel use.US pressure on its friends and foes worked, and Kyoto was celebrated as a win for American ambitions. “We took special pains … to fully protect the unique position of the United States as the world’s only superpower with global military responsibilities,” Stuart Eizenstat, undersecretary of the state department, told Congress. “The Kyoto protocol did not limit the US.”Crawford’s research began more than a decade ago after discovering there was no data to share with her undergraduate climate change students – despite the Pentagon having warned for decades about the threat of climate change to US national security.She found that military spending and emissions rise when the US is directly at war or preparing for war. During Ronald Reagan’s anti-communism buildup in the 1980s, spending surged and with it fuel use and emissions. After the end of the cold war, spending and emissions fell throughout the 1990s, apart from a spike during the first Gulf war. After the 9/11 attacks, emissions again surged as the US launched wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.Two bar charts. One shows Defense spending, the other shows emissions. They generally follow the same trend, peaking in the 1980s/early 90s, lowering around 2000, picking back up around 2010, before lowering again over the next decade.From 1979 to 2023, the Pentagon generated almost 4,000 MtCO2e – about the same as the entire 2023 emissions reported by India, a country of 1.4 billion people. Its installations and 700 bases account for about 40%, while 60% are operational emissions, resulting from fuel use in war, training and exercises with other countries, according to Crawford’s analysis.In addition, the military industry – US-based companies manufacturing weapons, planes and other equipment for warfare – generates more than double the greenhouse gases emitted by the Pentagon each year.Still, the known US military climate impact is probably a significant undercount. Crawford’s figures do not account for greenhouse gases generated by dropping bombs, destroying buildings and subsequent reconstruction. The additional CO2released into the atmosphere as a result of destroying carbon sinks such as forests, farmland and even whales killed during naval exercises are also not included, nor are those generated by burning oil fields or blowing up pipelines during conflicts.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

For instance, the emissions generated by the armed forces and death squads of Argentina, El Salvador and Chile during the US-backed dirty wars are not accounted for, nor those from China increasing its military exercises in response to US threats. Jet fuel shipped to Israel and Ukraine can be counted if transported on a military tanker, while commercial shipments of crude used for warfare are not.“These are important but, as yet, not well understood climate consequences of military spending and war,” Crawford said. “We’ve long underestimated the impact of mobilisation, war and reconstruction.”Yet the Pentagon has long warned that water scarcity, sea level rise and desertification in vulnerable regions could lead to political instability and forced migration, framing climate change as a “threat multiplier” to US interests. In 1991, former president George HW Bush formally acknowledged climate change as a national security threat.More recently, the direct threat posed by floods, wildfires and land degradation to US military capabilities has become clear. In 2018, during the firstTrump administration, flood water from Hurricane Michael destroyed an air force base in Florida, and then a few months later another storm significantly damaged the Strategic Command base in Nebraska, headquarters of the nation’s nuclear arsenal.Overall, the US military has reduced its fuel use and emissions since 1975, thanks to base closures, fewer and smaller exercises, switching from coal, and increasingly efficient vehicles and operations. But according to Crawford, this is driven by improving fighter efficiency – not the environment.“The Pentagon has framed migration from climate change as a threat in order to get more money, which shows a lack of compassion and a failure to think ahead. If they really believed their own rhetoric, they would of course work to reduce their contribution to climate change by reducing emissions. The irony is difficult to stomach,” she said.The military ripple effect is playing out. In response to Russia’s ground invasion of Ukraine – and more recently, Trump’s shift towards authoritarianism and anti-Ukraine, anti-Europe rhetoric – the UK, Germany and other Nato countries have increased military spending.Here lies a fundamental problem, Crawford argues. “We can’t let Ukraine fall, but that doesn’t mean you have to mobilise all of Europe’s militaries in this way and spend this much. Russia is not the threat that they were years ago, yet the current response is based around the same old aggressive military doctrine. It’s just nonsensical and bad news for the climate.“There’s a less expensive, less greenhouse gas-intensive way of standing up to the Russians, and that would be to support Ukraine, and directly,” said Crawford, an expert in military doctrine and peace building, and the current Montague Burton professor of international relations at the University of Oxford.Another global military trend that could have significant climate and environmental costs is the expansion of nuclear forces. The US and UK are considering modernising their submarine fleets, while China’s expanding nuclear force includes a growing arsenal of intercontinental ballistic missiles. The production of nuclear weapons is energy- and greenhouse gas-intensive.“Nuclear modernisation is supposed to be making us safer, more stable, but usually leads to adversaries also increasing conventional forces as well,” said Crawford. “It’s part of a broader militarisation, all of which leads to an upward spiral in emissions. The threat inflation always leads to emissions inflation.”The total military carbon footprint is estimated at about 5.5% of global emissions – excluding greenhouse gases from conflict and war fighting. This is more than the combined contribution of civilian aviation (2%) and shipping (3%). If the world’s militaries were a country, this figure would represent the fourth largest national carbon footprint in the world – higher than Russia.The global military buildup could be catastrophic for global heating, at a time when scientists agree that time is running out to avoid catastrophic temperature rises.And despite growing calls for greater military accountability in climate breakdown, Crawford fears the Trump administration will no longer publish the fuel data that she relies on to calculate Pentagon emissions. In addition to withdrawing from the Paris agreement, the Trump administration has failed to report the US’s annual emissions to the UN framework convention on climate change for the first time and has erased all mention of climate change from government websites.“Getting a handle on the scale, scope and impact of the world’s military emissions is extremely important, so that there is accountability and a path toward reduction … but the US is shutting things down,” said Crawford. “It’s becoming a black hole of information. It’s authoritarianism.”Explore more on these topicsClimate crisisGreenhouse gas emissionsCarbon footprintsDonald TrumpTrump administrationinterviewsShareReuse this content"

We must take back control of our party – before it’s too late, 28 May). Throughout his article, McDonnell argues for an alternative strategy to that being followed by the current prime minister, Keir Starmer.At no stage does he acknowledge that, when standing on this Corbyn/McDonnell policy platform,Labourlost two general elections. By losing these elections they condemned this country to seven years of Tory rule – seven years during which the Tories wreaked havoc. Yet I note that not once in his piece does McDonnell offer any kind of apology for these years of mayhem.Starmer is at least attempting to put this right. He changed the party’s policies in order to make it more electable, and he was (thankfully) successful. Now let him get on and finish the job. Passing “control” back to McDonnell and his sidekicks will merely send Labour back into the wilderness.Shaun SoperMidhurst, West SussexJohn McDonnellhas identified Labour’s malaise, which, he reminds us, affects not just its members in No 10 (hubris) but the entire movement (disillusionment). Almost a year ago seven MPs – including him – were suspended when they voted against maintaining the two-child cap on benefits, and after Labour’s recent U-turn we can only look forward, in hope, to their reinstatement. But, as he warns us, we face a looming crisis.He is right to characterise how Labour is governing as “timid”. Its tone-deaf acceptance of corporate gifting was dismissed as trivial sniping by the left. Try citing that as an excuse when attempting to retain support on the doorstep and being met with “they’re all the same” while those desperate for change look over your shoulder at Reform.The number of MPs who vote with the government, or abstain, when it attempts to cut disabled people’s benefits will be a measure of how deeply unwell the party has become.Dr Peter ManganBeckenham, KentJohn McDonnell’s criticism of the Labour government may well be music to the receptive ears of people frustrated by a lack of progress on many issues of concern to those in the labour movement and beyond in these still early days of Starmer’s government.I’m reminded of the early years of Tony Blair’s government, during which so many felt frustrated with progress. But look at how that changed and bore fruit, to the extent that by 2010 Labour was deemed an overspending, reckless, leftish government.In 2010, in the dog days of Gordon Brown’s tenure, I recall sharing a platform with John McDonnell, who castigated Brown as a rightwing monetarist who had failed the labour movement and the people. What we would all give to have those levels of social spending now.Trevor HopperLewes, East SussexLike John McDonnell, I am in my 70s, a lifelong Labour voter, and I have been a member of the party for more than 40 years. I would just note that every Labour government in my lifetime, including the great Attlee government, has been accused of betrayal and abandoning principles, mainly by people who claim to be on the left. I would also note that, despite the criticisms, it is Labour governments that have delivered almost every social advance and economic improvement in the lives of ordinary British voters over those more than seven decades.Alex GallagherLargs, North AyrshireBridget Phillipson says it is the moral mission “of this Labour government to ensure that fewer children grow up in poverty” (Report, 27 May).

Plus, a letter byChris MatthewsFri 30 May 2025 12.52 EDTLast modified on Fri 30 May 2025 21.30 EDTShareI was so moved by Bethan McKernan’s article on her time as the Guardian’s Jerusalem correspondent over the last four years (‘I worried I might start finding it normal. But I never did’ – what I learned as the Guardian’s Jerusalem correspondent, 29 May). Her experience of feeling a “maddening cognitive dissonance” in Tel Aviv/Jaffa from seeing people “out and about, doing pilates, walking their dogs, as if everything was fine – when just 50km down the road, on the same stretch of the Med, was an open-air prison” is exactly how I felt when I first visited Jerusalem in 2018 after spending time in the West Bank.I had decided to take my young family there to show them where my Palestinian father grew up under the British Mandate and see if we could find the home he’d lost in 1948. But I was also keen to ensure my children had a balanced view and understood the whole story, educating them about what the Jewish people had been through.I had come from Jordan via Bethlehem and Ramallah and been so touched by the generosity of the Palestinians I met who, despite living under very difficult conditions, were such wonderful hosts, inviting my family in to chat and share delicious home-cooked food. But arriving in lush Jerusalem from the barrenWest Bank, where Palestinians are treated like cattle, penned in by the wall and multiple checkpoints, was a striking contrast. After walking a few steps through the centre of Jerusalem with its gleaming shops, surrounded by people ostensibly living their best life, I broke down and cried at the injustice of it all.Growing up in London, people would sometimes tell me they were going on holiday toIsrael. “Have you been?” they would ask. “It’s wonderful.” They didn’t know my background, but I was left shocked that they only saw one side of it.What I loved about Bethan’s article is that over the last four years she has immersed herself in life there and deeply felt the positions of both Israelis and Palestinians. If we are going to make progress and reach a fair outcome, we have to put ourselves in each other’s shoes and deeply understand each other’s experiences.Alexandra LucasLondonJonathan Freedland describes Hamas’s actions on 7 October 2023 as “slaughter”, while Israel’s bombardment of Gaza ever since is just “killing” Palestinians (A biblical hatred is engulfing both sides in the Gaza conflict – and blinding them to reason, 23 May). The difference in outrage portrayed in these words reflects the lack of equivalence between the life of an Israeli and that of a Palestinian which has been at the heart of the conflict since the start.Chris MatthewsLondonHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

My son, who is now nine years old, had a blood clot in his small intestine which led to two major life-saving operations in 48 hours, and a complete change in his health, capabilities and lifestyle. My life has now been for ever split between “Before 16 April 2023” (the day my son nearly died) and “After”.Archie detailed the intense emotions of every step beautifully. One of the hardest things when you go through nearly losing a child, and having an altered child return to you, is the loneliness. He depicts this so well, as even if you are lucky enough to be surrounded by family and friends, it is hard to not feel as though you and your partner are the only two people in the world who are dealing with this fear, sadness, worry and desperate need to help your child.My family and I are now in a much better place – much better than we ever thought possible back in April 2023. There is a time when the loudest thoughts will fade – those grief-ridden thoughts about the future your child may have had, the desperate thoughts about making every moment count and being useful for your child’s development, the frightening thoughts about your child’s future, and the outright terrifying thoughts about their vulnerability after your own death.There is a time when they will fade into the background. They will always be there, but the loudest thought will be the love for your child and how they are capable of brightening up your day with the smallest gesture or smile. I offer Archie and his family my sincere best wishes.Faaiza MunirLondonExplore more on these topicsParents and parentingHealthChildrenNHSLonelinessMental healthFamilylettersShareReuse this content"

It has been an important medium for truthful reporting since the 1930s.I joined in 1967 as PA to its redoubtable editor Bob Gregson. Soon after, it became a 24-hour service, and in the years that followed it became a substantial international service.The reputation of its news and current affairs programmes and independent editorial stance was second to none, and it offered the world what was best in British culture. It was then funded by the Foreign Office.Over recent years, I have seen it shrinking in types of output, yet the importance and reputation of its news and current affairs remains as solid as ever. With the rise in misinformation and disinformation, particularly in these times of international conflict, it remains a beacon of truth.TheBBC World Service, and not just the English language service, cannot be allowed to shrink away to a token voice – or worse, nothing. Funding must be found from somewhere. Britain’s international reputation would be poorer without it.Diana HirstBroad Oak, East SussexYour editorial raises concerns over possible government funding cuts to theBBCWorld Service. By implication and in light of the government’s 1 April announcement to reduce VisitBritain funding by 41%, it is clear how priorities have changed over the use of soft power to influence positive perceptions of the UK – perceptions that will ultimately prove pivotal in securing much-needed economic growth and international investment.Andrew CampbellFormer chair, Wales Tourism AllianceHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Ibrahim Audu Hussein, a spokesperson for the state emergency management agency, said rescue efforts were still under way on Friday.“We have so far recovered 115 bodies and more are expected to be recovered because the flood came from far distance and washed people into the River Niger. Downstream, bodies are still being recovered,” Husseini told the AFP news agency. “So, the toll keeps rising.”More than 3,000 houses were submerged, he added.Mokwa, about 230 miles (370km) west of Nigeria’s capital, Abuja, is a commercial hub in Niger state, with many traders and heavy-duty vehicles often carrying goods to other regions.In Nigeria the rainy season usually runs from April to October. On Wednesday the Nigerian Meteorological Agency had issued aforecastof heavy storms for Abuja and 14 of the country’s 36 states including Niger.Niger, Nigeria’s largest state by landmass, is home to three major dams – Kainji, Jebba and Shiroro – which contribute significantly to the country’s electricity grid. A fourth dam is under construction.The state has beenprone to floodingin recent times. In April, water released from one of the dams destroyed more than 5,000 farms in 30 communities, including in Mokwa.Local news reportssuggested it was the sixth flood in the state this year.In 2022, floods in Nigeria killed more than 600 people, displaced about 1.4 million and destroyed 440,000 hectares of farmland.Experts havewarned of more extreme weather patternsdue to global heating.Explore more on these topicsNigeriaAfricanewsShareReuse this content"

His mother has not eaten any food since 29 September 2024, the date her son’s prison sentence was due to end. She had been surviving on herbal tea, black coffee, rehydration salts and 300-calorie liquid supplements.She resumed her full hunger strike on 20 May, saying: “Nothing has changed, nothing is happening.”UN investigators have declared Abd El-Fattah’s imprisonment in breach of international law. Earlier this year, Keir Starmer promised he would “do everything I can” to ensure his release.In a statement on Friday, Soueif’s family said she had received glucagon treatment, which induces the liver to break down stored fat to obtain glucose, but continued to refuse treatment that would provide her with calories.She was previously admitted to hospital in February, with doctors saying she was at “high risk of sudden death”.

However two of the court’s three liberal-leaning justices,Ketanji Brown JacksonandSonia Sotomayor, publicly dissented.The court “botched” its assessment of whether the administration was entitled to freeze Talwani’s decision pending the litigation, Jackson wrote in an accompanying opinion.The outcome, Jacksonwrote, “undervalues the devastating consequences of allowing the government to precipitously upend the lives and livelihoods of nearly half a million noncitizens while their legal claims are pending”.Jackson also said that “it is apparent that the government seeks a stay to enable it to inflict maximum pre-decision damage.”She added that those living under parole protections in this case now face “two unbearable options”.One option is to “elect to leave the United States and thereby, confront ‘dangers in their native countries,’ experience destructive ‘family separation’ and possibly ‘forfeit any opportunity to obtain a remedy based on their … claims”, Jackson wrote.The other option is that they could remain in the US after parole termination and “risk imminent removal at the hands of government agents, along with its serious attendant consequences”.To Jackson, “either choice creates significant problems for respondents that far exceed any harm to the government … At a minimum, granting the stay would facilitate needless human suffering before the courts have reached a final judgement regarding the legal arguments at issue, while denying the government’s application would not have anything close to the kind of practical impact.”Immigration parole is a form of temporary permission under American law to be in the country for “urgent humanitarian reasons or significant public benefit”, allowing recipients to live and work in the US. Biden, a Democrat, used parole as part of his administration’s approach to handling migrants entering at theUS-Mexico border.Such a status does not offer immigrants a long-term path towards citizenship but it can typically be renewed multiple times. A report from the American Immigration Councilfoundthat halting the program would, apart from the humanitarian effect, be a blow to the US economy, as households in the US where the breadwinners have temporary protected status (TPS) collectively earned more than $10bn in total income in 2021 while paying nearly $1.3bn in federal taxes.Trump called for ending humanitarian parole programs in an executive order signed on 20 January,his first day backin office. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) subsequently moved to terminate them in March, cutting short the two-year parole grants. The administration said revoking the parole status would make it easier to place migrants in a fast-track deportation process called “expedited removal”.The case is one of many that the Trump administration has brought in an emergency fashion to the nation’s highest judicial body seeking to undo decisions by judges impeding the president’ssweeping policies, includingseveral targetingimmigrants.Trump administration sets quota to arrest 3,000 people a day in anti-immigration agendaRead moreThe supreme court on 19 May also let Trump end TPS that had been granted under Biden to about 350,000 additional Venezuelans living in the United States, while that legal dispute plays out.Jackson was the only justice topublicly dissentthen, while House Democrats condemned the supreme court’s decision.In a bid to reduce unauthorized border crossings, Biden starting in 2022 offering limited extra pathways to come to the US legally, allowingVenezuelanswho entered the US by air to request a two-year parole if they passed security checks and had a US financial sponsor. Biden expanded that eligibility process to Cubans, Haitians and Nicaraguans in 2023 as his administration grappled with high levels of illegal immigration from those countries.The plaintiffs in this case, a group of migrants granted parole and Americans who serve as their sponsors, sued administration officials claiming they violated federal law governing the actions of government agencies.Talwani in April found that the law governing such parole did not allow for the program’s blanket termination, instead requiring a case-by-case review. The Boston-based first US circuit court of appeals declined to put the judge’s decision on hold and the government appealed.The justice department told the supreme court that Talwani’s order had upended “critical immigration policies that are carefully calibrated to deter illegal entry”, effectively “undoing democratically approved policies that featured heavily in the November election” that returned Trump to the presidency.The plaintiffs told the supreme court they would face grave harm if their parole is cut short given that the administration has indefinitely suspended processing their pending applications for asylum and other immigration relief.They said they would be separated from their families and immediately subject to expedited deportation “to the same despotic and unstable countries from which they fled, where many will face serious risks of danger, persecution and even death”.Speaking at the White House on Friday afternoon,Donald Trumppraised the decision, saying “a couple of hours ago we had a great decision from the supreme court that’s very important”.Reuters contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsUS immigrationUS supreme courtTrump administrationDonald TrumpVenezuelaCubaNicaraguanewsShareReuse this content"

Other organisations, including local trade unions, have stepped in to help make up the shortfall, but Modeste told the Guardian he was deeply worried about the celebration’s future.Pride Toronto loses corporate funding as Trump’s DEI purge has chilling effectRead more“Am I going to have to drastically cut what the festival looks like for 2026? This is not the place that I want to be in,” he said.Home Depot told the Guardian it continually reviews its non-profit giving and decided not to contribute this year. Google told the newspaper it would be supporting “Toronto Googlers” marching in the parade and “community moments” from Pride.The sudden exit of Google and Home Depot follows the departure in February ofthree other prominent sponsors. At the time, Modeste did not name them, but on Friday he revealed that they were Nissan, Adidas and Clorox.NissanCanadasaid it was unable to sponsor Pride in Toronto due to a “local decision” that it says was based on a reevaluation of marketing and media activities. Adidas and Clorox have been approached for comment.“These are American companies and they are showing their true colours,” said Modeste. “We thought they were with the community, but clearly, they’re not.”Corporate sponsorship not only goes towards paying staff, but hundreds of local artists and to keepPrideas a free event.Modeste said he grew up in a period before widespread Pride celebrations – and did not want that to be the experience of current younger generations. “I don’t want to be the one to have to make that decision, to take Pride away from the community,” he said.The White House’s condemnation of diversity and inclusion efforts has resulted in corporations shirking away from festivals that they once loudly supported, said Sui Sui, a professor at Toronto Metropolitan University whose research focuses on DEI initiatives.Sui said that the move also signals that commitments large sponsors made in the past were tenuous and motivated not because of genuine support, but because of the perceived profitability of aligning with such causes.Scared advertisers, flag bans and Trump: the US is in for a troubled Pride 2025Read moreThemonths-long purgeof US federal government workers by the Trump administration has resulted in the firings of tens of thousands of people, including those who worked in forwarding diversity and equity initiatives.Sui said that the chill aroundsponsors for pride eventshas also affectedNew York City and Philadelphia.

In Manitoba alone, wildfires have burned about 200,000 hectares already this year – already about three times the recent full-year average for the province.Canada wildfires: thousands in Manitoba ordered to evacuate as state of emergency declaredRead moreMore than 17,000 people are in the process of being airlifted out of wildfire zones by the Canadian military, some of which now have no safe overland roads connecting them to the rest of the country. Wab Kinew, the Manitoba premier,declareda province-wide state of emergency on Wednesday, and Saskatchewan’s premier, Scott Moe,declared the sameon Thursday.“This is the largest evacuation Manitoba will have seen in most people’s living memory,” Kinew said at a press conference. “For the first time, it’s not a fire in one region, we have fires in every region. That is a sign of a changing climate that we are going to have to adapt to.”First Nations in Saskatchewanhave been particularly affectedby the fires this week, with some entire communities evacuated and occasionally trapped by road closures due to unsafe conditions.Drone footagecirculated by CBC showed towering flames and burned homes and cabins in northern Saskatchewan on Wednesday. Wildfires arealso burning in Alberta’s oil countryand have disrupted production and forced evacuations there this week.View image in fullscreenPeople wear protective masks as the Roosevelt Island Tram crosses the East River while haze and smoke from the Canadian wildfires shroud the Manhattan skyline in New York City, on 7 June 2023.Photograph: Shannon Stapleton/ReutersSatellite images captured over the past two weeks showed extreme fire behavior,including pyrocumulus clouds, that until recent years has been a rare occurrence in northern Canada – especially in the early days of the annual fire season. These clouds signify an especially hot and intense fire, and can help transport smoke high into the atmosphere where it can then travel long distances.In advance of the wave of wildfire smoke, the US National Weather Service has issued air quality alerts for parts of Minnesota between Lake Superior and the Canadian border.Weather forecasts show smoke continuing to billow across the border into the United States over the coming days, which could notably worsen air quality further downstream in cities such as Chicago, Detroit and Washington DC. Air quality in the worst-affected cities across the midwest and mid-Atlantic regions could reach the “red” category, signifying an air quality index exceeding 150 and unhealthy conditions for all groups.Graph showing area burned by wildfires in Canada by yearA prolonged period of unusually warm and dry conditions helped to intensify this week’s fires, continuing a trend worsened by climate change. The fire seasons of 2023 and 2024 were the worst two years in Canadian history. In June 2023, wildfire smoke transported southward from Canada turned skies orange over New York City, briefly making its airthe most unhealthy of any city in the world.Trump’s mass federal cuts disrupt LA wildfire recovery: ‘It’s coming tumbling down’Read moreThe most recent assessments by Natural Resources Canada show that fire conditions arecurrently maxing out the scaleacross much of the regions where wildfires are now burning out of control. Government forecastersalso predictthat the fire seasons in the provinces of Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta and British Columbia will all continue to be “well above average” for the remainder of the spring and summer.The health effects of wildfire smoke is an increasingly urgent area of medical research. Astudy published this weekfound for the first time that exposure to the fine soot particles of wildfire smoke can have adverse effects on the heart and lungs for months after the smoke clears. Otherrecent studieshave found that wildfire smoke worsens the risk of stroke, negatively impacts brain function, and can even interfere with fertility treatments.The worrying truth emerging from these studies is that there appears to be no safe level ofexposure to wildfire smoke, which can be up to 10 times more toxic than the soot and smog of typical urban air pollution.New datasuggest that thousands of people now die each year from wildfire smoke in the US, creating billions of dollars of additional costs to the economy.Expertsrecommendwearing a fitted N95 or similar mask if you are exposed to wildfire smoke outdoors, and using a portableair filtration systemif you are indoors.Explore more on these topicsUS newsWildfiresCanadaHealthClimate crisisAmericasExtreme weatheranalysisShareReuse this content"

A flicker of agitation ran through the plaza.Aftermonths of cartel conflict, Sinaloa is on edge. Yet on 1 June, it and the rest of Mexico will start to elect every judge in the country, from local magistrates to supreme court justices, by popular vote.It is a world-first democratic experiment, but one that has prompted warnings of low turnout, a political power grab and infiltration by organised crime.The reform is the most radical move made by the governing Morena party and its allies since theywon a congressional supermajoritylast year allowing them to change the constitution at will.Few disagree that Mexico’s judicial system needs change. Justice is inaccessible to many, corruption is commonplace and impunity is rampant.‘An atmosphere of terror’: the bloody rise of Mexico’s top cartelRead moreMorena claims its reform will address these issues by making the judiciary more responsive to popular opinion.But critics say it will bulldoze the separation of powers, and that by throwing the doors open to less qualified candidates whose campaigns may be backed by opaque interests – including organised crime groups – it could aggravate the very problems it seeks to solve.Delia Quiroa, a well-known advocate forMexico’s disappeared, is no fan of the reform. But she admits it has given her a chance to become a federal judge she would not otherwise have had.It is just the latest unexpected turn in a life that was shattered the moment her brother, Roberto, was disappeared on 10 March 2014.Though born in Culiacán, Quiroa moved to the border state of Tamaulipas when she was a child. She had been studying to become an engineer, but as the years stretched on with no sign of her brother, she retrained as a lawyer to force the authorities into action.Threats from criminal groups eventually displaced her family to Mexico City. Then last year they moved back to Sinaloa, which for years had been relatively calm owing to the dominance of the eponymous cartel.View image in fullscreenA mural with faces of some of the thousands of disappeared people in the state of Sinaloa, on 16 May.Photograph: Jesús Verdugo“People used to say that the narcos in Sinaloaleft the public out of [their fights],” Quiroa said, with a rueful smile. “Then this conflict began.”In July 2024, Ismael “El Mayo” Zambada, who founded the Sinaloa cartel withJoaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán, wasdetained by US authoritiesalong with one of Guzmán’s sons after a small plane touched down in Texas.El Mayoaccused El Chapo’s sonof betraying and delivering him to US authorities. Now a faction led by El Mayo’s son is waging war against another led by the two sons of El Chapo who remain free in Mexico.As the conflict enters a ninth month, it has left well over2,000 dead or disappeared.Mother’s Day brings only grief for those seeking Mexico’s disappearedRead moreAnd it has made the judicial elections even more complicated.“The violence has hit the campaign,” said Quiroa. “You can’t always find people in the streets.”The city’s central market was Quiroa’s target for the day. Friends and family came along, handing out pamphlets with her logo: a spade and a gavel crossed over the scales of justice.“I try to explain that I have no political or economic interest in this,” said Quiroa. “That the only thing I want is a change in this country.”But as Quiroa bounced between market stalls, people’s responses did nothing to dispel fears of an uninformed vote come 1 June.Unlike in other elections, parties cannot support candidates, nor can candidates openly profess a partisan affiliation, even if theyclearly have one.View image in fullscreenDelia Quiroa hands out pamphlets and example ballot papers on 16 May, in Culiacán’s central market.Photograph: Jesús VerdugoRadio and TV spots are also banned, meaning largely unknown candidates are limited to handing out flyers and posting on social media.Then there is the sheer number of candidates. Voters will be faced with at least six ballot papers, some with dozens of names on them but little else. “It looks like an exam,” sighed Quiroa.Even an enthusiastic supporter of the reform – a butcher behind a pile of cow hooves, who celebrated the election as a chance for “the people to stop the robbery” – could not name a candidate.Others were sceptical, if not cynical. “I’m not going to vote for candidates I don’t know,” said one shoe shiner, who was reading a dog-eared biography of the 19th-century president Benito Juárez. “Just like I won’t eat a meal if I don’t know what’s in it. It’s common sense.”According to the president of the National Electoral Institute, voter turnout is expected to beless than 20%.Even though Morena is not allowed to back candidates, many assume the ruling party will use its unrivalled capacity to mobilise voters tohelp its preferred candidates– particularly for the supreme court, which has often acted as a check on Morena’s executive power, and a new disciplinary tribune, which will keep judges in line.Land of no return: the Mexican city torn apart by cartel kidnappingsRead more“Morena wants to hoard all the power,” said the shoe shiner. “They don’t want to leave a crumb for anyone else.”But other interests, including organised crime, may also seize the opportunity.Defensorxs, a civil society organisation, has identified various “highly risky” candidates, including a lawyer who was counsel to El Chapo and a former state prosecutor in Michoacán accused of alleged involvement in the murder of two journalists.“I don’t think people have managed to find out who the candidates are and what each kind of position actually does,” said Marlene León Fontes of Iniciativa Sinaloa, a civil society organisation. “People will vote on the basis of personal connections or political parties.“It’s a blind date with democracy,” she said.If Quiroa emerges a judge, she says she will be an “iron fist” against corrupt and negligent authorities – not least when it comes to searching for the more than 120,000 people registered as disappeared, and identifying the72,000 bodies in Mexico’s morgues.View image in fullscreenDelia Quiroa makes her pitch on 16 May to a butcher in Culiacán’s central market.Photograph: Jesús Verdugo“It was the feeling of being tortured by the authorities who should be protecting me that made me put myself forward as a candidate,” said Quiroa.Yet as far as Quiroa knows, she is the only candidate to have emerged from the many thousands searching for their relatives.“I’d have liked there to be more – and more victims of all kinds who are lawyers and human rights defenders,” said Quiroa. “But many people said they didn’t want to be part of the destruction of the judicial system.”Quiroa shares their anxiety.“This is an experiment,” she said. “And we don’t know how it’s going to go.”Explore more on these topicsMexicoAmericasJoaquín 'El Chapo' GuzmánDrugs tradenewsShareReuse this content"

That compares with harvests of 8m in the late 1980s.Michael Bustamante, chair of Cuban and Cuban-American Studies at the University of Miami, described the situation as “dismal”. “You have to go back to the 19th century to find numbers this low,” he said.Cuba is in the grip ofan all-encompassing economic crisis, and for the past few years has been importing sugar to feed its people, but rum producers do not have the luxury of importing. “The regulations provide that all the liquids have to come from within the country,” an industry executive said, speaking anonymously.It is particularly worrying because the island’s rum industry has been a rare bright spot in its economy. Big international luxury brands are involved, competing in world markets with distinctive Cuban spirits.View image in fullscreenAn operator distributes sugar at a mill in Aguada de Pasajeros, Cienfuegos province, Cuba.Photograph: Adalberto Roque/AFP/GettyDiageo, LVMH and Pernod Ricard all have ventures with the government in Havana, often involving tortuous legal structures to placate OFAC, the US Office of Foreign Assets Control, which polices Washington’ssix-decade-plus trade embargoagainst the island.These companies – and a small British/Norwegian upstart called the Island Rum Company – have invested heavily in their respective brands: Ron Santiago, Eminente, Havana Club and Black Tears. Now there are concerns about their prospects. “It is threatened,” said the executive.Rum as we know it was invented in Cuba in 1862 when a shopkeeper in the coastal city of Santiago thought he could do better than the rot gut then produced in pot stills on the country’s plantations worked by enslaved people. His name was Facundo Bacardí.He began using column stills to distill molasses, a byproduct of sugar refining, selecting theaguardienteliquor on the edge of the pure alcohol, before ageing it in oak. His family, and the rum they produced, became the most famous in Cuba, until they were forced out in the Castro brothers’ 1959 revolution.The Castros wanted Cuba to be financially independent of other countries, a never-ending issue for the island, and sugar was at the heart of their plans. In 1970, they mobilised 500,000 volunteers to create a 10m-tonne harvest.The effort fell short, but at least until the late 1980s Cuba produced around 8m tonnes a year. There was always a lack of investment in the machinery, though, which the government blames on the US embargo.Now the 133 mills at the time of the revolution have been reduced to 14, and only six reportedly still operate. “The sugar production numbers have been steadily decreasing for the better part of 20 years, but particularly over the last five,” said Bustamante. “I think it’s just as clear a signal as you can get over the dire straits of the economy overall.”View image in fullscreenHavana Club’s San José distillery, in San José de las Lajas, Mayabeque province, Cuba.Photograph: Yamil Lage/AFP/GettyThe Enrique Varona sugar mill is in the settlement of Falla, around halfway along the island’s length. On a recent visit, the workers looked exhausted as they lathed a heavy bit of metal in the hope of keeping the great mill running.In contrast, Pernod Ricard’s distillery south of Havana is modern and slick. The French drinks company was the first of the big foreign operations to arrive, doing a deal with Corporación Cuba Ron, the state producer, in 1993. In return for an agreement not to allow other competitors in for 20 years, it took over the Havana Club brand, building sales from 300,000 cases to more than 4m.“They made a huge investment in a moment in which no one had the guts to invest in Cuba,” said Luca Cesarano, who until recently ran the rival brand of Ron Santiago.With the end of that agreement in 2013, others such as Diageo arrived. Unlike Pernod Ricard, they were not distilling themselves, but employing rum makers – known as maestros – to make specific spirits in Cuba’s state distilleries.View image in fullscreenA shop display in Havana.Photograph: Alexandre Meneghini/ReutersThey were also using historical collections of rum that the maestros had for years been storing in oak barrels across the country, even as the roofs of their bodegas grew full of holes.These high-end products have fed an international resurgence in rum. LVMH, the luxury powerhouse, arrived to make Eminente, creating the Hotel Eminente in Paris to promote it. The Island Rum Company has found a strong following in Cuba and abroad by associating itself with young Cuban musicians (its Black Tears brand takes its name from a Cuban song,Lagrimas Negras).But with the supply of molasses drying up, all this work is threatened. “I think the fourth quarter will be particularly tough,” said the executive. “There won’t be any alcohol.”Explore more on these topicsFood & drink industryCubaSugarCaribbeanAmericasCocktailsnewsShareReuse this content"

He said it was crucial that allied nations act together to maintain credibility against aggressors.“We are living in a time of crisis and need new ways of cooperating,” he said in the keynote speech. “Our key challenge is how to preserve peace and stability and prosperity in this current environment.“We have a challenge of revisionist countries that want to impose – under the name of spheres of influence – spheres of coercion. Countries that want to control areas from the fringes ofEuropeto the archipelagos in the South China Sea … that want to appropriate resources, whether fishing or mineral, and crowd out others for their benefit.”Macron warned against a “division between the two superpowers and an instruction to all the others that you have to choose a side”. He said: “If we do this we kill the global order … all the institutions created after the second world war to preserve peace.”Macron’s pointed speech saidFrancewas and would remain a friend and ally of the US, but it did not want to be dependent, or affected “by the decisions of a single person”.“We live in a time of the erosion of longtime alliances,” he said. “The sense that their promise might not be so ironclad is ushering in a new instability. We see it every day.”However, he said the Trump administration’s request for other nations to take on more of the burden was a “fair” one and “we need Europeans to do much more for themselves”.Sitting in the audience for Macron’s speech was the US defence secretary, Pete Hegseth, who in March accused Europeof being “pathetic”and “freeloading”, in a Signal chat with other Trump officials that was later published.Macron’s speech also warned that the failures of Europe and the US to end the Ukraine war, as well as double standards over Gaza that gave Israel a “free pass”, risked destroying the west’s remaining credibility.“What is at stake is the global order, and our credibility to protect the global order,” he said.Macron’s speech doubled down on comments earlier in the day calling for European countries to “harden their collective position” on Israel if there are not improvements to the humanitarian situation in Gaza, where the UN has said the entire population is at risk of famine.Israel accused Macronof a “crusade against the Jewish state” with his remarks. The defence minister, Israel Katz, said Israel vowed to build a “Jewish Israeli state” in the occupied West Bank, in a “clear message to Macron and his associates”.The Shangri-La dialogue draws senior officials from governments and militaries around the world for three days of speeches, expert panels and closed-door discussions. Hegseth is scheduled to speak on Saturday.Historically, the conference has hosted significant bilateral meetings, including one last year between Lloyd Austin, then the US defence secretary, and his Chinese counterpart, Dong Jun. However, this year Beijing sent just a single delegate, from the People’s Liberation Army National Defense University. It is the first time since 2019 thatChinahas not sent its defence minister.China-US relations have plummeted again since Trump took office this year, and many military-to-military channels have been suspended.China has ‘totally violated’ its trade agreement’ with the US, says TrumpRead moreSome analysts have suggested Dong’s absence is a missed opportunity for China, which could use the conference to further strengthen ties with nations that are perhaps more suspicious of the US. Others have noted that at previous conferences China has been criticised on panel after panel.Zhou Bo, a retired senior Chinese army colonel attending the conference, told the Guardian the absence was not unusual, as China had sent defence ministers only five times in the past.Zhou said he did not know why China had sent a smaller delegation, but he dismissed rumours that the minister was embroiled in corruption investigations, noting that Dong was traveling overseas.“Will the world change much because the Chinese defence minister will not come? Or are there not other occasions for China to talk about its own views? Yes, there are,” he said.Explore more on these topicsEmmanuel MacronFranceSingaporeChinaUS foreign policyTrump administrationEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

That is the good news!!! The bad news is that China, perhaps not surprisingly to some, HAS TOTALLY VIOLATED ITS AGREEMENT WITH US.”Trump’s post follows comments from the treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, on Fox News that trade talks with China “are a bit stalled”, though he said that there will be more discussions with Chinese officials in the coming weeks. The White House has not offered any specific details on what has stalled trade talks.US stock markets turned negative after the news.

After raising rates to 20% in March, a full-out trade war began with Trump imposing 145% tariffs on China, and China placing 125% tariffs on American goods in response.A truce was announced on 12 May, with Trump decreasing tariffs to 30% and China reducing US tariffs down to 10%. The White Housecalledthe deal “historic” and said it “set a path for future discussions to open market access for American exports”.But Trump’s post on Friday points to the continued instability amid the president’s trade war, which has shaken markets around the world for weeks.Investors appeared somewhat relieved by news late on Wednesday that a panel of judges on the US international court of tradeblockeda bulk of Trump’s broad tariffs, including country-specific import duties such as ones placed on China.

However, its export-reliant economy, which is heavily dependent on sending goods to the US, faces the threat of a 46% tariff announced early this year by Donald Trump.How Trump tariffs could push Vietnam into the arms of ChinaRead moreNoting the need for Vietnam to transform its economic strategy, the Economist article stated: “If Mr Lam fails, Vietnam will muddle on as a low-value-added production centre that missed its moment”, adding that reforms could, on the other hand, “propel 100m Vietnamese into the developed world, creating another Asian growth engine”.View image in fullscreenThe Economist issue featuring Vietnam’s top leader, To Lam.Reports by both Reuters and Bloomberg quoted unnamed distributors who said they could not obtain copies of the magazine or that it had been banned.An unnamed executive at distributor Ngay Moi told Reuters they had been ordered to “tear off” the cover and article about Lam, adding: “Later, we were ordered not to sell it at all.”An employee at a second distributor, Global Book Corporation, also told Reuters Vietnam’s ministry in charge of public information had banned the edition.Democracy activist Chau Van Kham says he wasn’t afraid of dying in Vietnamese prisonRead moreVietnam’s ministry of foreign affairs and the Economist did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Earlier this month, Vietnamese authorities ordered telecom providers to block the messaging app Telegram, accusing it of failing to cooperate with efforts to crack down on crime. An internal document reported by Reuters said that many Telegram groups “with tens of thousands of participants were created by opposition and reactionary subjects spreading anti-government documents”.Vietnam has little tolerance for dissent and maintains a tight control on the media, with press freedom groupReporters sans Frontièresranking it as among the worst in the world for media freedoms - at 173 place out of an index of 180 countries. The group describes Vietnam as “one of the world’s biggest prisons for journalists”.Aleksandra Bielakowska, advocacy manager for RSF said the decision to ban distribution of the Economist reflected the continued repression of press freedom in the country.“It is clear that the Vietnamese authorities consider a free press a challenge to its one-party rule, and will do anything in its power to silence independent voices,” Bielakowska said, citing the case of journalistPham Doan Trang, who has been detained for nearly five years by the regime.“While Vietnamese authorities seek rapprochement with democracies to boost its economy, the international community as a whole must seize this opportunity to put human rights and freedom of the press on the frontline of its negotiations,” she added.Explore more on these topicsVietnamAsia PacificPress freedomnewsShareReuse this content"

Local media reported some of the four arriving at their homes early on Friday. Sham told reporters he would see them “in the afternoon”.“I want to reserve some time for my family,” he said in Cantonese, according to Hong Kong Free Press.Li reportedly thanked gathered reporters “for the hard work” before moving inside.The four are the second group of the Hong Kong 47 to be released. At the end of April, former pro-democracy lawmakers Claudia Mo, Kwok Ka-ki, Jeremy Tam and Gary Fan werereleased from three separate prisonsacross Hong Kong around dawn.The 47 pro-democracy campaigners were arrested and charged in early 2021 with conspiracy to commit subversion under a Beijing-imposed national law which carried sentences of up to life in prison.Forty-five of these were convicted after a marathon trial, with sentences of up to 10 years. Only two were acquitted.The democrats were found guilty of organising an unofficial “primary election” in 2020 to select candidates for a legislative election. Prosecutors accused the activists of plotting to paralyse the government by winning a majority of seats and blocking government bills to force a dissolution. . The election was postponed, and rescheduled after an electoral overhaul that ensured only pro-Beijing “patriots” could run.Human rights groups and some western governments including the US called the trial politically motivated and had demanded the democrats be freed.Hong Kong and Beijing, however, say all are equal under the national security laws and the democrats received a fair trial.Since large and sustained pro-democracy protests erupted in Hong Kong for most of 2019, China has cracked down on the democratic opposition as well as liberal civil society and media outlets undersweeping national security lawsthat have broadly criminalised dissenting behaviours, including benign acts of protest.Explore more on these topicsHong KongChinaAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

The story in the other capitals was no better.Party membership numbers are closely guarded by office bearers, but Guardian Australia has spoken to several party sources in bothNew South Walesand Victoria, who were willing to disclosure figures on the condition they were not named.Sussan Ley and David Littleproud need this frontbench lineup to heal Coalition wounds. It will be anything but easyRead moreIn Victoria, three sources said membership numbers were between 9,000 and 10,000, with the majority based in the federal electorates of Kooyong, held byteal independent Monique Ryan, and Goldstein, which willlikely be won by Liberal Tim Wilson.A former member of the Victorian Liberal executive said the division had about 15,000 members close to 20 years ago. The party has since shed members, according to the source, and the average age of those who remain has climbed to 68.“One of the biggest expenses we used to have [at our local branch] was on funeral wreaths,” they said. “We’d be down at the florist every week handing over $70.”Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailBoth state divisions are urging members to renew their annual memberships after a bruising federal election loss. One Victorian source said as of mid-May, about 30% of members had not renewed.In NSW, one Liberal source said party membership dipped below 10,000 after the state election loss in March 2023, before climbing to close to 12,000 by the end of the year. Another source said the current numbers were somewhere between 8,000 and 10,000.Earlier this month, NSW Liberal officials confirmed about 5,000 people had allowed their membership to lapse in recent years. Inan opinion piece in the Australian Financial Review,they blamed the decline on factional fighting in branches.“Our membership has declined by more than 1,000 in just a year, many branches refuse to support in any way their sitting MP not of their faction and we have lost successive state and federal elections,” three senior party elders wrote.Slightly more than 600 applicants have been refused membership, according to the party officials, due to concerns they may impact the power balance within branches.The NSW Liberal party’s annual disclosures to the state electoral commission also show a significant drop in revenue from members.In 2018-19, the party generated $1.38m from “paid individuals” who had either a membership, an affiliation or a party subscription. That figure dropped to $836,770 last financial year, according to disclosures.“We need to actively go out and seek people and build personal relationships with them in an organisation that isn’t transactional, but transformational,” said one NSW Liberal source. “It’s not about getting people to door knock or donate, it’s about working together to help change government policy.”Several Liberal sources in both states, including federal MPs, have complained about losing volunteers and donors to third-party groups, such as Advance Australia.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

When contacted for a response to these concerns earlier this month, Advance’s executive director, Matthew Sheahan,accused “bed-wetting anonymous Liberals”of “looking to blame everyone but themselves”.One former Liberal, who is now involved in political campaigns for third-party groups, said they used to direct members from seats such as Goldstein and Kooyong to other electorates in Victoria. But since the rise of teal independents, they were now required in their own seats.Inside the Liberals’ battle to save John Pesutto from bankruptcyRead moreThey said as a result, the party had become increasingly dependent on “non-cause actors”, who are not party members, to support them at other, marginal polling booths. They referred to reports that members ofthe Exclusive Brethren religious sectwere handed out how-to-vote cards before the 3 May poll, despite the church barring followers from voting.“Labor has the labour movement, the Greens the environment, Nationals the country,” the source said. “The Liberals aren’t a movement. Maybe, back in the day, they were an anti-communist movement but there are no communists in Labor any more.”One Victorian Liberal MP downplayed the drop in numbers and said a decline in volunteers was common across almost all community groups – not just political organisations. They said the cost of living had contributed to a “slight decline” in membership.Sussan Ley, onbeing elected as leader, pledged to rebuild the party in major cities and appeal to a broader subsection of Australian society.“If we stay focused, our political movement has the foundations to rebuild and once again guide Australians toward a better future,”Ley said earlier this month. “That starts with accepting the fact that Australians sent a clear message at the election. We must listen, change and develop a fresh approach.”With additional reporting by Anne DaviesExplore more on these topicsLiberal partyCoalitionVictoriaAustralian politicsNew South WalesAustralian election 2025newsShareReuse this content"

Instead, the party – now almost synonymous with political self-sabotage – has imploded once again.And it’s likely only going to get worse from here as the countdown officially begins for former leader John Pesutto topay the $2.3m in legal fees he owes Moira Deeming or face bankruptcyafter he was found in December to have defamed her.“The pain for John may be about to end, but the pain for others may be just about to begin,” one of Pesutto’s supporters warned.The week had started with a sense of optimism fromPesutto’s successor as opposition leader, Brad Battin, and his team.Aftermachete-wielding rival gangs sent a shopping centre into lockdownat the weekend, the Labor government on Mondayrushed to ban the sale of the kniveswithin 48 hours.It was a move the Liberals had advocated for since 2023, giving them a rare “we told you so” moment. They also had their budget reply on Tuesday, headlined by a policy designed to win back young voters: abolishing stamp duty for properties under $1m.But whatever momentum the Liberals were hoping to build vanished before the shadow treasurer stood up to deliver his speech.Earlier on Tuesday, a party room meeting was called to discuss what – if anything – was being done by Battin to avert a byelection in the seat of Hawthorn – which will occur if Pesutto is bankrupted and therefore disqualified from parliament.The issue of the byelection – which many Liberals believe the party would lose – was raised by the Sandringham MP, Brad Rowswell, who had attempted to discuss it during a shadow cabinet meeting on Monday but was told it was a matter for the broader party room.After facing criticism that such a discussion would distract from the party’s messaging, Rowswell deferred the discussion altogether.But the matter still made headlines and overshadowed the budget response. A Liberal MP loyal to Battin said it was an intentional move to “destabilise” the leader, while a detractor said it was a “valid question everyone has been asking”.It only got worse for Battin, when a letter from Deeming’s lawyers to Pesutto was leaked to the media on Wednesday.Victorian Liberals prepare last-minute bid to bail out John Pesutto with loan to help pay $2.3m defamation costsRead moreIt suggested that in the event of Pesutto’s bankruptcy, Deeming would seek to recover her legal costs from those who contributed to his defence fund. The list includes three former Liberal premiers, Ted Baillieu, Denis Napthine and Jeff Kennett, two sitting MPs, Georgie Crozier and David Southwick, and other party figures who have supported the Hawthorn MP.According to one Pesutto supporter, the letter had the effect of “galvanising support” for the beleaguered former leader, as it “showed it won’t end with him if he is bankrupted”.“It will engulf the entire party with months of hearings and political bloodletting ahead.”Deeming’s lawyers are set to initiate bankruptcy proceedings on Monday, after Pesutto failed to meet Friday’s deadline. Pesutto will then have a further three weeks to pay the $2.3m owed, of which sources say he has raised around a third.Deeming’s lawyers have also applied to the federal court for leave to issue sub­poenas to obtain communications between Pesutto and those who donated to his unsuccessful legal defence.“It will be a shit show for all involved and a nightmare for the party,” another Pesutto supporter said.Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailIt’s no wonder Battin faced relentless questioning on the matter. On Wednesday, he repeated the same line that he would keep his conversations confidential and urged his colleagues to stay “on message”.But Southwick broke ranks, urging people to “step up” to prevent a Hawthorn byelection.“The fact that [Pesutto’s] fighting for his job, fighting for his livelihood – it is horrific, regardless of what people think about the situation,” he told reporters.As one Liberal MP privately quipped: “They were the type of comments Brad should have made a fortnight ago”.They weren’t alone in their criticism. Several Liberal MPs have expressed frustration that Battin failed to show leadership during a week when the party desperately needed him to.Even some who backed him in the December leadership spill are now questioning their decision. The Herald Sun has already reportedmurmurs of a leadership challenge– less than six months into Battin’s tenure.In a sign of how desperate the situation has become, one rumour doing the rounds is that former MP Matt Bach could be asked to return from the UK to lead. Other names being bandied about are Matthew Guy, in what would be his third go as leader, or Jess Wilson, who lost her leadership bid in December.If all this wasn’t enough, the cherry on top of a shocker week were several stories scrutinising expense claims by Battin’s deputy, Sam Groth, including allegations that he used a taxpayer funded, chauffeur-driven car – assigned to Crozier – to take himself and his wife from a fundraising event at the Australian Open to their home in Rye and spending $3,269 on hotel stays after sporting events.Groth, who is also the opposition spokesperson for tourism, sport and events, on Friday said his conduct “was and is above board”.“It has all been officially disclosed. There is nothing to hide,” he said.For her part, Croziertold the ABCshe was “incredibly disappointed” over the issue, and that “Victorians deserve a lot better”.“I think that Sam needs to explain his actions – I can’t,” she said.Again, Battin was forced to front the press on Friday on the defensive.“It’s pretty obvious we’ve had some tensions in the party at the moment. And I’m continuing to work through that,” he said.If anything this week is proof, yet again, that the VictorianLiberal partyis too often its own worst enemy.With additional reporting by Henry BelotThis article was amended on 31 May 2025. Jess Wilson challenged for Victorian Liberal leadership, not deputy leadership as stated in an earlier version.Explore more on these topicsVictorian politicsLiberal partyVictoriaanalysisShareReuse this content"

But the direction was at odds with the Albanese government’s pledge to cut pollution to reach targets for 2030 and 2050.The data was released on Friday, two days after the environment minister, Murray Watt, announced he planned toapprove a 40-year life extension for one of Australia’s biggest fossil fuel developments– Woodside Energy’s North West Shelf liquified natural gas (LNG) processing facility in the Pilbara.No one committed to Paris goals can seriously argue Woodside’s LNG project should operate until 2070Read moreBased on the Burrup peninsula, in Murujuga country, the North West Shelf is Australia’s third biggest industrial polluter,responsible for about 1.4%of the country’s annual climate pollution.The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, has rejected concerns about the facility’s emissions continuing for decades after 2050, saying the national goal was “net zero, not zero”, implying ongoing fossil fuel use could be justified by using acontentious carbon offset scheme. His comments echoed languageused in 2021by the Coalition’s then emissions reduction minister, Angus Taylor, when defending climate policies under Scott Morrison.Rising electricity useThequarterly greenhouse gas inventorysaid the increase in national emissions last year may be short-lived, with preliminary data suggesting they fell in the first quarter this year.Sign up to get climate and environment editor Adam Morton’s Clear Air column as a free newsletterEmissions last year were estimated to be 446.4m tonnes of carbon dioxide, 0.2m tonnes higher than in 2023. The increase is largely due to pollution from electricity generation rising by 2.2%, reversing a 10-year trend. Australians used more electricity overall, and there was less hydro power available than usual during winter. Solar use was up, but the extra demand was otherwise met by more coal and gas.Initial data for the March quarter suggest the long-term trend of pollution from electricity falling should restart this year. This has been backed bya separate report by the Australian Energy Market Operator.At the end of last year emissions from power generation was 23.7% lower than in 2005. Experts expect it to continue to fall as a government underwriting programannounced in November 2023supports an influx of new large-scale solar, wind and batteries.But emissions from transport continue to surge as Australians fly more and burn more diesel in bigger cars and trucks. Pollution from the transport sector was up 1.9% last year. It has skyrocketed 20.8% since 2005.Vehicle efficiency standards introduced last year require auto companies to reduce the average pollution from new cars each year, but they are expected to only gradually affect total transport emissions.‘More to do’Government officials estimated national pollution was 27% below 2005 levels, largely due to a change in the amount of carbon dioxidethat is absorbed by the land and forests. The Albanese government has a legislated target of a 43% cut by 2030 and has promised a 2035 target later this year.The climate change and energy minister, Chris Bowen, said Labor was on track to reach the 2030 target but there was “more to do” to get there.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toClear Air AustraliaFree newsletterAdam Morton brings you incisive analysis about the politics and impact of the climate crisisEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The government’s target is that 82% of electricity will come from renewable energy by 2030. “You can’t have renewables unless you have firming capacity. Simple as that,” Albanese said. “You don’t change a transition through warm thoughts.”Asked about the WA development, Albanese said the Tomago aluminium smelter in New South Wales’ Hunter Valley relied on gas to firm renewable energy, and WA’s main electricity grid would become more reliant on gas as the state closed its remaining coal-fired power plants.The prime minister did not say how much gas from the facility was destined to be used in Australia.According to analysis of recent data, the overwhelming bulk of the gas produced on the North West Shelf and elsewhere in WA – 81% – was exported. Another 7% was used by the gas industry as part of the production process. About 8% was used for gas-fired electricity generation in WA. None was used at Tomago.The Woodside boss’s attacks on my generation are blatant scapegoating – and we see straight through them  | Hannah FergusonRead moreCritics have challenged the economic and climate basis for a decades-long extension of the processing facility’s life. Alex Hillman, from the Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility and a former Woodside Energy climate change adviser, said analysts from the International Energy Agency had projected the world was heading foran “LNG glut” later this decade.“There is no commercial justification to add further LNG supply, and there is certainly no climate justification,” he said. “Whilst there is major flooding in New South Wales and a major drought in South Australia, these are emissions that are going to cause Australians and investment portfolios further harm as the physical impacts of climate change increase.”Explore more on these topicsGasFossil fuelsEnergyLabor partyAnthony AlbanesenewsShareReuse this content"

This led to the development of mifepristone in 1982.Dragged before the courts and demonised by US anti-abortion groups who accused him of inventing a “death pill”, Baulieu refused to back down.“Adversity slides off him like water off a duck’s back,” Simone Harari Baulieu told AFP.“You, a Jew and a resistance fighter, you were overwhelmed with the most atrocious insults and even compared to Nazi scientists,” the French president, Emmanuel Macron, said as he presented Baulieu with France’s top honour, the Grand-Croix de la Legion d’Honneur, in 2023. “But you held on, for the love of freedom and science.”In the 1960s, literature fan Baulieu became friends with artists such as Andy Warhol.He said he was “fascinated by artists who claim to have access to the human soul, something that will forever remain beyond the reach of scientists.”Baulieu kept going into his Parisian office well into his mid-90s. “I would be bored if I did not work any more,” he said in 2023.His recent research has included trying to find a way to prevent the development of Alzheimer’s disease, as well as a treatment for severe depression, for which clinical trials are under way across the world.“There is no reason we cannot find treatments” for both illnesses, he said.Baulieu was also the first to describe how the hormone DHEA was secreted from adrenal glands in 1963.He was convinced of the hormone’s anti-ageing abilities but drugs using it only had limited effects, such as in skin-firming creams.In the US, Baulieu was also awarded the prestigious Lasker prize in 1989.After his first wife, Yolande Compagnon, died, Baulieu married Simone Harari in 2016.He leaves behind three children, eight grandchildren and nine great-grandchildren, according to the statement released by his family.Explore more on these topicsFranceAbortionEuropeHealthWomenWomen's healthnewsShareReuse this content"

There is nothing left for the whales to prey upon so they have moved on in search of prey elsewhere.”The company, based in the coastal village of Unionhall, had thrived for most of its 25 years, but only a few minke whales and small groups of dolphins now appeared in its search area, he said. “Over the last couple of years our trips have become totally disappointing. In this light I am truly sad to say we are closing down for good.”The announcement prompted a public outcry and a promise from the government to do more to protect fish stocks and marine biodiversity.“We have to introduce measures to protect this forage species – not just for whales, but for all the other fish stocks and wildlife that depend on it – to prevent the collapse of an entire food web,” Christopher O’Sullivan, the minister responsible for nature and biodiversity,told the Irish Examiner. He said he hoped Ireland would emulate UK curbs on sprat fishing, which were having a positive effect.Demand for fishmeal from fish farms has dramatically increased the fishing of sprats, a small, sardine-like fish that plays a crucial role in the maritime food chain.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

It’s like a farmer taking all the grass out of his fields and expecting his cows to thrive.”However, Gannon said he had invested in a new boat and still offered enthralling excursions, albeit with less wildlife. “Just today we saw three minke whales,” he said on Friday after a tour. “Compared to the numbers we had before it’s chalk and cheese, but we still have a beautiful coastline. With the right policies, the south of Cork and the west coast ofIrelandcould be the European capital of marine tourism.”His wife and company co-owner, Trish Gannon, said bookings remained strong. “I tell people we can guarantee absolutely nothing in terms of sightings and they’re still happy to go out.”Patrick Murphy, the chief executive of the Irish South and West Fish Producer’s Organisation, said warming waters appeared to be pushing sprat further west and north – where sprat catches have risen sharply – and this accounted for the dwindlingwhalesightings off Cork.“We are asking for a proper scientific assessment for this species, so a proper management policy can be developed to ensure the continued sustainability of this important fishery,” he said.Explore more on these topicsIrelandWhalesCetaceansMarine lifeFishingWildlifeEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

The group, which includes Porsche, revealed it has been in direct talks with Donald Trump’s administration as it faces damaging tariffs.Oliver Blume, who heads the group, said the talks were “constructive” and “fair”, in an interview that suggests the company, whose market capital is £44bn, is not willing to leave tariff negotiations to Brussels alone.Speaking to Süddeutsche Zeitung, Blume said he had been to Washington himself and had a direct line to the US commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick, but had agreed to keep details of the talks confidential.He hoped that plans for substantial investment would help shape Trump’s ultimate decision on the 25% tariffs the US imposed on auto imports in April.“Our primary contact is the US secretary of commerce, but ultimately, the issues also go through the US president’s desk,” he said. “So far, we’ve experienced absolutely fair, constructive discussions. Of course, many things are complex, and we’ve agreed not to share any content. I will stick to that.”An ‘earthquake’ at Volkswagen – and a crisis for Germany?Read moreHis interview comes ahead of the latest round of talks between the EU and the US, with Maroš Šefčovič, the EU commissioner for trade, expected to meet Lutnick on the sidelines of an OECD council meeting in Paris on Tuesday.There is a widespread expectation that whatever the outcome of the talks, a baseline tariff of about 10% will probably endure beyond the July expiry date of Trump’s 90-day pause.Blume said he was talking to Washington on behalf of Volkswagen, but always had “an eye on solutions that can be applied universally”.He said the Volkswagen Group “intends to continue investing in the US” and would build on its partnership with the American electric vehicle manufacturer Rivian with “further, massive investments”.In a reference to the tariff talks, he added: “All of this should play a role in decisions”.View image in fullscreenVolkswagen and Porsche CEOOliver Blume.Photograph: Liesa Johannssen/ReutersThe past year has already been one of the group’s most challenging, with sales of Chinese electric vehicles in the EU soaring, and Volkswagen not yet in the market with an entry-level rival.Trump’s tariffs on car imports will hit Porsche particularly hard as – unlike VW models and German counterparts BMW and Mercedes-Benz – Porsche cars sold in the US are almost exclusively manufactured inGermany.The failure of the German auto sector to anticipate the onslaught of competition from China is seen as a symptom of a wider malaise in the sector, with Volkwagen planning to cut 35,000 jobs by 2030.In March, the company revealed a30% year-on-year drop in net profitsowing to high production costs and decreased sales in China.Asked what was the biggest mistake made by German manufacturers, Blume said “we’ve rested on our laurels for too long” and “realised too late that the world is changing extremely rapidly and dynamically”.The German car industry needed to stop spending “endless time … debating”, and instead needed to “decide and act”, he said.Sales of Chinese electric vehicles in the EU have more than trebled between 2019 and 2023, according to industry figures, with 10% tariffs imposed by Brussels in 2024 slowing growth.However, the EU still believes China is not doing enough to create a level playing field and faces fresh concerns that Chinese goods, originally destined for the US, will be diverted to Europe in the long term.Blume defended the company’s electric vehicle strategy, saying it would be launching VW, Cupra and Skoda EVs for about €25,000, followed by a cheaper entry-evel car tagged the “ID.EVERY1”.He admitted that job cuts were “painful” but said “something has to happen” if the company “wants to survive long term”.Explore more on these topicsAutomotive industryTrump tariffsVolkswagen (VW)GermanyTariffsEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Stencilled across it are the words “I want to be what you saw in me”.A Banksy fansite claimed that the work was inLe Panier, a district north of Marseille’s port that is known for its graffiti, which includes several works by theFrench street artist Invader, who uses a pixelated style.ButBBC Verifyfound that it matched a Google Street View image ofRue Felix Fregier, a backstreet in the St-Lambert part of the city, just south of the port. This covered street, like many in Marseille, is lined with lighthouse-shaped bollards and includes vents of the kind visible in some of the images of the new Banksy.Close to the latest work, revealed on Thursday, is a tag that appears to read Yaze, which is the mark used by a Canadian graffiti artist who also goes by the name Marco the Polo and citesBanksyas an inspiration.Banksy’s works have fetched millions at auction, prompting speculation over the Bristol graffiti artist’s identity.Inspiration for the quote in the lighthouse artwork may have come from the songSoftlyby the Tennessee-based country band Lonestar, which features the lyric:“I want to be what you see in me.I want to love you the way that you love me.”A swathe of animal-themed Banksy works appeared in London last year, includinga rhino seemingly mounting a silver Nissan Micra, two elephant silhouettes with their trunks stretched towards each other, three monkeys that appeared to be swinging on a bridge, and agorilla on a shutter at London zoo.Since then, Banksy has posted a mural depicting theMadonna and child.Explore more on these topicsBanksyFranceStreet artArtEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Lawyers for the broadcaster defended the documentary and said the libel action was a cynical attempt to launder Adams’s reputation.The former West Belfast MP said a BBC Spotlight documentary and accompanying online article defamed him in 2016 by claiming he had sanctioned the murder ofDenis Donaldson, a former Sinn Féin official who was shot dead in County Donegal months after admitting he had for decades been a police and MI5 informant. The claim about Adams was made by an anonymous source known only as “Martin”.Adams’s lawyers accused the BBC of “reckless journalism” and of making an “unjustified” attack on a man credited with helping to bring about the peace process that drew a line under the Troubles in 1998.The BBC said it acted in good faith and that the claim was presented as an allegation and not as a fact and had been corroborated by five other sources, including the security services. Lawyers for the broadcaster argued that because Adams was widely considered to have been an IRA commander during the Troubles he had little reputation to lose and that any damages would be a “cruel joke”.Speaking outside the court, Adams said: “From my perspective, taking this case was about putting manners on the British Broadcasting Corporation. I know many, many journalists. I like to think that I get on well with the most of them, and I wish you well, and I would uphold your right to do your job.“But the British Broadcasting Corporation upholds the ethos of the British state inIreland, and in my view it’s out of sync in many, many fronts with the Good Friday agreement. It hasn’t caught on to where we are on this island as part of the process, the continuing process, of building peace and justice, and harmony, and, hopefully, in the time ahead, unity.”Paul Tweed, a solicitor for Adams, said his client was very pleased at the verdict, which he said showed the BBC should not have included the disputed claim in its broadcast. “Not only had the false allegation regarding our client been the focus of the Spotlight documentary, but it had been utilised to sensationalise and publicise their programme,” said Tweed.“Furthermore, the fact that the false allegation has been left online for almost nine years has, in my opinion, done much to undermine the high standards of accuracy that is expected of the BBC. This case could and should have been resolved some considerable time ago.”Adams, 76, took centre stage in the witness box for much of the trial, which covered his childhood and political awakening, the evolution of the Troubles, theIRA’s deadly campaign and the peace process. He repeatedly denied ever being a member of the IRA. “It wasn’t a path that I took,” he said.Other witnesses included Jennifer O’Leary, the BBC reporter who made the documentary, and media experts who gave contrasting views on the programme and accompanying article. Litigation lawyers estimate the total cost of the trial could exceed several million euros.Before sending out the jury to begin deliberations on Thursday, Justice Alexander Owens said there was no need to decide on the veracity of the allegation that Adams sanctioned Donaldson’s murder, or to make a judgment on the republican leader’s role in Irish history.The judge instructed the jury of five men and seven women to consider whether the words in the documentary and article meant Adams had sanctioned the murder, or were presented only as an allegation, as the BBC had argued. The jury determined that the meaning of the words was that Adams had sanctioned the murder. It also found that the BBC had not acted in good faith and not proved its “fair publication” defence.The judge had told the jury that if it found in favour of Adams and awarded damages, it should assess the damages on the basis of Adams’s current and recent reputation.Adams was a teachta dála – a member of the Dáil – for Louth when the programme aired. He stepped down as president ofSinn Féinin 2018 after leading the party for 35 years.Adam Smyth, the director of BBCNorthern Ireland, expressed disappointment at the outcome. Speaking outside court, he said: “We are disappointed by this verdict. We believe we supplied extensive evidence to the court of the careful editorial processes and journalistic diligence applied to this programme, and to the accompanying online article. Moreover, it was accepted by the court and conceded by Gerry Adams’s legal team that the Spotlight broadcast and publication were of the highest public interest.“We didn’t want to come to court but it was important that we defend our journalism and we stand by that decision. Our past is difficult terrain for any jury and we thank them for their diligence and careful consideration of the issues in this case.”Explore more on these topicsGerry AdamsBBCIrelandEuropeNorthern IrelandDefamation lawMedia lawnewsShareReuse this content"

One hundred per cent of the population at risk of famine,” he said on Friday.“Gaza is the hungriest place on Earth.”Laerke detailed the difficulties faced by the UN in delivering humanitarian aid to the Gaza Strip. Nine hundred trucks of humanitarian aid had been authorised byIsraelto enter the strip since the blockade was partially lifted, but so far only 600 had been off-loaded on the Gaza side of the border, and a smaller number of shipments had then been picked up for distribution within the territory because of security considerations, he said.Laerke said the mission to deliver aid was “in an operational straitjacket that makes it one of the most obstructed aid operations not only in the world today, but in recent history”.Once truckloads entered Gaza, they were often “swarmed by desperate people”, he said.Daniel Meron, Israel’s UN ambassador, rejected the claim, saying UN agencies “cherrypick the facts to paint an alternative version of reality and demonise Israel”.“In a desperate effort to remain relevant, they lambast the best efforts of Israel and its partners to facilitate delivery of humanitarian aid to the civilian population. UN feedsHamas, we make sure aid gets to those in need,” he wrote on X.In a reflection of the increasingly dire conditions inside the territory, a UN spokesperson said late on Friday that “armed individuals” hadraided a warehouse at a field hospital in Deir al-Balah, “looting large quantities of medical equipment, supplies, medicines, nutritional supplements that was intended for malnourished children”.View image in fullscreenPalestinians gather to receive food portions from a charity kitchen at a refugee camp in Khan Younis.Photograph: Anas Deeb/UPI/ShutterstockHamas said on Friday it was“thoroughly reviewing” Israel’s responseto a US proposal for a Gaza ceasefire deal, although one of the militant group’s officials said the plan did not meet any of the Palestinians’ “just and legitimate demands”.One afternoon in Gaza, two family tragedies: the childhoods cut short by Israeli airstrikesRead moreHamas has described the latest proposal as more biased in favour of Israel than previous versions. It said it was consulting other “Palestinian factions”, a term referring to other groups operating under Hamas’s rule in Gaza, such as Palestinian Islamic Jihad.Late on Thursday,Benjamin Netanyahutold the families of hostages held in Gaza that Israel had accepted the draft deal presented by Steve Witkoff, Donald Trump’s Middle East envoy.Deep differences between Hamas and Israel have stymied previous attempts to restore a ceasefire that broke down in March after only two months when Israel renewed its offensive.Israel has insisted that Hamas disarm completely and be dismantled as a military and governing force, and that all 58 hostages still held in Gaza be returned before it will agree to end the war.The Israeli government fears a lasting ceasefire and withdrawal would leave Hamas with significant influence in Gaza, even if it surrenders formal power. The Israelis are concerned that with time Hamas may be able to rebuild its military might and eventually launch more 7 October-style attacks.On the other hand, Hamas fears Israel could break the ceasefire again and resume the war, which the Israeli government would be permitted to do after 60 days under the deal.The militant group has rejected the demand to give up its weapons and says Israel must pull its troops out of Gaza and commit to ending the war.Netanyahu also faces political constraints: his far-right coalition partners have threatened to bring down his government if he ends the war too soon. That would leave the prime minister more vulnerable to prosecution on longstanding corruption charges and to investigations into the failures surrounding the Hamas attack in 2023.The far-right security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, said on Friday it was time to use “full force” in Gaza. “Mr Prime Minister, after Hamas rejected the deal proposal again – there are no more excuses,” Ben-Gvir said on his Telegram channel. “The confusion, the shuffling and the weakness must end. We have already missed too many opportunities. It is time to go in with full force, without blinking, to destroy, and kill Hamas to the last one.”The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, a private logistics group backed by the US and endorsed by Israel, expanded its food distribution to a third site on Thursday.Heavily criticised by the UN and other aid groups as inadequate and flawed, the group’s operation began this week in Gaza after Israel’s 11-week blockade on aid entering the territory.Laerke said that by having people collect aid rather than delivering it to them where they are, they become a target for looters once they leave the site. “It is so desperate and tragic and frustrating, and wildly unhumanitarian,” he said.The launch was marred bytumultuous scenes on Tuesdaywhen Israeli troops opened fire on a large crowd, killing at least one civilian and injuring dozens. The chaotic start to the operation has raised international pressure on Israel to get more food in and halt the fighting in Gaza. GHF says it has so far supplied about 1.8m meals, and plans to open more sites in the coming weeks.View image in fullscreenPeople stand in the street after an Israeli attack in Gaza City on Friday.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesNetanyahu has faced growing criticism from key international allies in recent days.The French president, Emmanuel Macron, said on Friday that abandoning war-torn Gaza to its fate and giving Israel a “free pass” would kill the west’s credibility with the rest of the world.“If we abandon Gaza, if we consider there is a free pass for Israel, even if we do condemn the terrorist attacks, we will kill our credibility,” Macron told a top defence forum in Singapore, adding: “And this is why we do reject double standard.”Israel responded by accusing the French president of undertaking a “crusade against the Jewish state”.“There is no humanitarian blockade. That is a blatant lie,” Israel’s foreign ministry said in a statement, defending its efforts to allow in aid. “But instead of applying pressure on the jihadist terrorists, Macron wants to reward them with a Palestinian state. No doubt its national day will be October 7.”Macron said recognition of a Palestinian state with conditions was “not only a moral duty, but a political necessity”.A “hardened stance” would mean dropping an assumption that human rights were being respected, and applying sanctions, he said.Israeli jets continued to pound Gaza on Friday, killing at least 14 people in Jabaliya refugee camp, according to medics who received the bodies at al-Shifa hospital in northern Gaza. The previous day, Israeli strikes killed 45 people, including 23 in the Bureij camp in central Gaza Strip, Palestinian medical workers said.Israel launched its campaign in Gaza in response to the devastating Hamas attack in southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which 1,200 people were killed and 251 hostages taken into Gaza, according to Israeli tallies. The campaign has killed more than 54,000 Palestinians, Gaza health officials say, and left the territory in ruins.Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warGazaPalestinian territoriesUnited NationsAidHungerHamasnewsShareReuse this content"

The pair have found a vastly rewarding way to straddle the line between public service and private profit.Photograph: Jim Watson/AFP/Getty ImagesDonald TrumpTrump and special envoy Witkoff stand to reap rewards from official businessCrypto venture with Abu Dhabi could enrich pair with millions – and Democrats say ethics conflict is ‘plain as day’Doyle McManusFri 30 May 2025 06.00 EDTSharePresident Trumpreceived plenty of attention this monthwhen he happily accepted a $400m Boeing 747 from the Persian Gulf emirate of Qatar.“Only a FOOL would not accept this gift on behalf of our country,” Trump posted on social media.But Trump and his golf buddy turned special negotiator Steve Witkoff landed a much bigger gift this month, likely to enrich them far more:a $2bn investmentin their new cryptocurrency venture from the emirate of Abu Dhabi.The investment by a firm controlled by Abu Dhabi’s sovereign wealth fund will go toWorld Liberty Financial, a cryptocurrency firm whose biggest beneficiaries are the Trump and Witkoff families.Thanks to Abu Dhabi’s purchase of their “stablecoin”, the Trumps and Witkoffs will collect hefty fees and could reap hundreds of millions of dollars in interest payments.The deal isn’t as headline-grabbing as Qatar’s plane, but it’s a lot more valuable. It was the biggest single purchase of World Liberty’s cryptocoins yet – an immense injection of revenue into Trump’s most lucrative personal money-making scheme.None of this is normal. Presidents don’t usually maintain private businesses that sell investment vehicles to foreign leaders who seek favor with the United States. Nor do they appoint their private business partners as diplomatic envoys to negotiate with the same leaders over war and peace.But Trump and Witkoff have found a vastly rewarding way to straddle the line between public service and private profit.Abu Dhabi is the wealthiest and most powerful member of theUnited Arab Emirates, an oil-rich federation of seven Persian Gulf emirates. After Abu Dhabi invested $2bn in the Trump-Witkoff stablecoin, Trump agreed to allow the UAE to buy more advanced AI semiconductors from American companies. “It’s a very big contract,” the president observed.In 2023, the Biden administration sharply restricted exports of advanced chips to the UAE because of fears that some of the technology could leak to China, which has deep economic ties with the emirates.‘I learned the business from him’Witkoff and Trump first met in the 1980s, when Witkoff was a lawyer working on one of Trump’s Manhattan real-estate deals. Witkoff says he adopted Trump as a role model; “I learned the business from him,” he told Tucker Carlson in March. Over time, the two dealmakers became golf buddies, friends and business partners. After Trump lost the White House in 2020, Witkoff became one of his staunchest defenders, and testified as a character witness at Trump’s 2024 New York trial on business fraud charges.It was Witkoff who first alerted Trump to the opportunity to take over a fledgling cryptocurrency firm that their respective sons had discovered, World Liberty Financial.The two families negotiated equity interests in the venture, which now showcases Trump on its website as its “chief cryptocurrency advocate”. Witkoff is listed as a “co-founder”. A heroic photograph of Trump dominates the website.A Trump family subsidiary owns 60% of World Liberty and is entitled to 75% of net income from its coin sales, according to the website. A Witkoff family firm is entitled to 12.5%. The firm says it sold more than $550m in cryptocurrency “tokens” in its first five months of operation, generating undisclosed amounts of fees and profits for the Trump and Witkoff families. Most of the sales occurred after Trump’s election.Before Trump’s inauguration, when he wasthe president-elect’s personal envoy for Gaza, Witkoff promoted World Liberty at a crypto investors’ conference in Dubai. The meeting’s organizers billed him as both a co-founder of World Liberty and the incoming president’s key man for the Middle East.During the same period, Witkoff met – in his diplomatic role – Saudi Arabia’s Mohammed bin Salman, the UAE’s Mohamed bin Zayed, and Qatar’s Tamim bin Hamad, all of whom command enormous sovereign wealth funds.After Trump’s inauguration, Witkoff helped broker Qatar’s offer to donate a spare 747 to the president, according to the New York Times.Witkoff came equipped with plenty of experience doing business in the Gulf. He knew the heads of several sovereign wealth funds from earlier real-estate deals.A UAE-controlled fund invested in his purchase of New York’s Park Lane hotel in 2013; in 2016, the Qatari fund took the troubled property off their hands.When Russia’s Vladimir Putin sent a special envoy to Washington to talk with Witkoff about Ukraine, his emissary wasn’t a diplomat; it was Kirill Dmitriev, the head of Russia’s sovereign wealth fund.Once Witkoff landed his government post as Trump’s all-purpose peace negotiator, he appears to have stepped back from active involvement in World Liberty.A Witkoff spokesman at the state department, Edgar Vasquez, said the envoy “does not discuss WLF [World Liberty Financial] or any other personal business while conducting his official duties”.His son Zach Witkoff has acted as the firm’s chief overseas salesman instead.The fact that Zach’s father is one of Trump’s closest confidants appears to have helped open doors. When Zach Witkoff visited Pakistan last month, he met the country’s powerful army chief and its prime minister, an unusual level of access for an obscure cryptocurrency firm. The prime minister’s officenoted in a news releaseon the meeting that Zach is “the son of Steve Witkoff”.A White House that is ‘open for business’No modern precedent exists for a US diplomatic envoy so deeply tangled in a president’s private business interests.“I can’t think of any parallel,” said Robert Dallek, a retired UCLA historian who has written biographies of Franklin D Roosevelt, John F Kennedy and Lyndon B Johnson.Presidents have sent special envoys abroad since the early days of the republic. George Washington sent Gouverneur Morris, a delegate to the constitutional convention, to London in 1789 to negotiate peace with Britain. Roosevelt sent investment banker Averell Harriman to Moscow in 1941 to talk with Stalin. But historians say they can’t think of any instance in which a special envoy was also the president’s partner in a private moneymaking venture.In more recent history, then secretary of state Hillary Clinton came under fire after foreign donors made big donations to the private Clinton Foundation, prompting allegations the family was mixing public and private interests.Trump and other Republicans denounced that arrangement as unethical.“It’s a criminal enterprise – Saudi Arabia giving $25m, Qatar,” Trump said in 2016. “These are people that kill women and treat women horribly. And yet you take their money.”“My goal is to keep foreign money out of American politics,” Trump said.This time it’s Democratic senators who are raising alarms.“The White House is open for business, and the Trump family is proudly advertising to the world where to send the check,” Chris Murphy of Connecticut told the Guardian.“The Trumps and the Witkoffs are in business together making money off their government positions,” he said. “It’s just plain as day.”Murphy charged that the administration’s announcement that it plans to relax restrictions on semiconductor exports to the UAE, a change the emirates have long sought, is a “quid pro quo” for Abu Dhabi’s investment in the Trump-Witkoff crypto venture.“You wouldn’t be investing in Trump stablecoin unless you want something from him,” Murphy said. “It’s all about getting access to Trump and ultimately getting favorable policy from the United States.”Murphy and other Democrats also charge that once the emirates have those chips, it will be difficult for the United States to prevent some of them from reaching China, which also has close ties to the emirates.“China will be right there waiting to get their hands on that technology,” he warned.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines USFree newsletterGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He has already collected substantial gains from his equity in World Liberty. And even after a divestment, if his sons profit thanks to his diplomatic post, that would appear to be a violation of the OGE regulations.Trump is exempt from all conflict of interest regulations, because Congress decided long ago that restricting a president’s authority because of his financial interests would be both impractical and a constitutional overstretch.View image in fullscreenTrump meets Mohammed bin Salman, the Saudi crown prince, in Riyadh earlier in May.Photograph: Brian Snyder/ReutersThe White House says Trump and Witkoff have done nothing wrong.“Despite dishonest claims from Democrats, there are no conflicts of interest,” deputy press secretary Anna Kelly said in a written statement.“Special Envoy Steve Witkoff is divesting from all of his assets, including WLF, and has no operational role in the company. These types of baseless accusations only serve to distract from all his incredible work in service to the country.”The same goes for Trump, she said.“The president’s assets are in a trust managed by his children” – a back-handed acknowledgement that Trump, unlike many of his recent predecessors, has neither divested nor placed his assets in a blind trust. “There are no conflicts of interest,” she repeated.But “no conflicts of interest” doesn’t square with the facts. World Liberty is openly using its association with the president to generate profit for the Trump and Witkoff families.Senator Murphy dismissed the White House’s defense as “absurd on its face”.“Everybody can see what’s going on,” he said.As for Witkoff’s day job – negotiating peace in Gaza, ending the war in Ukraine, and cutting a deal with Iran – it doesn’t appear to be going especially well.In Gaza, Witkoff helped to close Biden’s ceasefire deal in January by making the point that Trump wanted it, and by making sure Netanyahu got – briefly – on board. But he’s failed at several attempts to extend or renew the ceasefire. He won freedom for one Israeli-American hostage by going around Netanyahu, but not the 20 Israeli hostages who are still believed alive; he’s trying to negotiate another temporary ceasefire that would free about half of the captives. He and Trump appear to have misjudged how stubborn Netanyahu would be in his desire to continue the war.In Ukraine, Witkoff tried to win Putin’s confidence by pre-emptively endorsing some of Russia’s main demands, including its claim to five Ukrainian regions including Crimea. That hasn’t been enough; Putin still appears intent on pursuing his goal of controlling all of Ukraine. In a two-hour telephone call on 19 May, Trump tried to jawbone Putin into embracing a ceasefire, but the Russian leader merely agreed to hold more talks – during which he intends to continue the war.On Iran, Witkoff initially stumbled by publicly softening US policy, saying Iran could maintain a uranium enrichment program as long as it didn’t move toward weapons capability. After a storm of protest from US hardliners, he backed off and returned to the demand that Iran dismantle its entire enrichment program. Trump has given the US-Iranian negotiations a deadline of mid-June, but that’s unlikely to be enough to reach a result. Then secretary of state John Kerry needed 20 months to negotiate the 2015 agreement that Trump scrapped, and that was after years of preparatory work.‘He knows nothing’What’s gone wrong? The answer from many foreign policy professionals is that Witkoff, a real-estate developer with no previous diplomatic experience, is in over his head.“He knows nothing about Russia, he knows nothing about Ukraine, he knows nothing about Iran, he knows nothing about nuclear weapons,” said John Bolton, who served as national security adviser for 18 months during Trump’s first term. “What could go wrong?”Witkoff readily acknowledges that he was naive when he started.“Of course I didn’t understand the dimensions of it,” he said of the Gaza conflict. “Now I do.”Witkoff says he’s fully devoted to his peacemaking mission and considers it more important than anything he accomplished in his real estate career. “The work is so worthy,” he told the Atlantic.Trump has long derided US diplomats as lousy negotiators and extolled entrepreneurs as master dealmakers.This month, at a belated swearing-in ceremony for Witkoff, Trump awarded his friend the highest compliment in his business-world lexicon: “He’s a killer.”Witkoff told the Atlantic that he’s been boning up on traditional diplomacy by reading books and watching Netflix documentaries. “I watched a ton of stuff on Henry Kissinger,” he said.But Kissinger never tried to negotiate three complex deals at the same time. Kissinger’s negotiations to withdraw US troops from Vietnam lasted more than three years. His talks to reopen US relations with China took more than a year. His disengagement agreements between Israel and Egypt took about 20 months.Witkoff has been on the job for only four months – six if you count his time as Trump’s pre-inaugural Gaza envoy. And he’s working for a president whose foreign policy decisions often appear erratic.So landing the Nobel peace prize, as Kissinger did, is likely to be a tall order. But Trump and Witkoff will have at least one consolation: By the end of Trump’s term, their families will be a lot richer.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpUnited Arab EmiratesMiddle East and north AfricaUS foreign policynewsShareReuse this content"

This is more thanthe combined 2023 annualgreenhouse gases emitted by Costa Rica and Estonia, yet there is no obligation for states to report military emissions to the UN climate body.Israel’s relentless bombardment, blockade and refusal to comply with international court rulings has underscored the asymmetry of each side’s war machine, as well as almost unconditional military, energy and diplomatic support Israel enjoys from allies including the US and UK.Hamas bunker fuel and rockets account for about 3,000 tonnes of CO2e, the equivalent of just 0.2% of the total direct conflict emissions, while 50% were generated by the supply and use of weapons, tanks and other ordnance by the Israeli military (IDF), the study found.View image in fullscreenAn Israeli tank on the Israel-Gaza border on 27 May 2025.Photograph: Amir Cohen/ReutersBurning fossil fuels is causing climate chaos, with increasingly deadly and destructive extreme weather events forcing record numbers of people to migrate. The Gulf region is among the most vulnerable to extreme weather and slow-onset climate disasters including drought, desertification, extreme heat and erratic rainfall, as well as environmental degradation, food insecurity and water shortages.The research, published by the Social Science Research Network, is part of a growing movement to hold states and businesses accountable for the climate and environmental costs of war and occupation, including the long-term impact damage to land, food and water sources, as well as post-conflict clean-up and reconstruction.It is the third and most comprehensive analysis by a team of UK and US-based researchers into the climate cost of the first 15 months of conflict in which more than 53,000 Palestinians have been killed, in addition to widespread infrastructure damage and environmental catastrophe. It also provides the first, albeit partial, snapshot of the carbon cost of Israel’s other recent regional conflicts.Overall, researchers estimate that the long-term climate cost of Israel’s military destruction inGaza– and recent military exchanges with Yemen, Iran and Lebanon – is equivalent to charging 2.6bn smartphones or running 84 gas power plants for a year. This figure includes the estimated 557,359 tCO2e arising from the occupation-era construction of Hamas’s network of tunnels and Israel’s “iron wall” barrier.The killing and environmental destruction of Gaza resumed when Israel unilaterally violated the ceasefire after just two months, but the findings could eventually help calculate claims for reparations.“This updated research evidences the urgency to stop the escalating atrocities, and make sure that Israel and all states comply with international law, including the decisions from the ICC and the ICJ,” said Astrid Puentes, UN special rapporteur on the human right to a clean, healthy and sustainable environment. “Whether or not States agree on calling it a genocide, what we are facing is severely impacting all life in Gaza, and also threatening human rights in the region, and even globally, due to the aggravation of climate change.”The study, currently under peer review by the journal One Earth, found:Over 99% of the almost 1.89m tCO2e estimated to have been generated between the 7 October 2023 Hamas attack and the temporary ceasefire in January 2025 is attributed to Israel’s aerial bombardment and ground invasion of Gaza.Almost 30% of greenhouse gases generated in that period came from the US sending 50,000 tonnes of weapons and other military supplies to Israel, mostly on cargo planes and ships from stockpiles in Europe. Another 20% is attributed to Israeli aircraft reconnaissance and bombing missions, tanks and fuel from other military vehicles, as well as CO2 generated by manufacturing and exploding the bombs and artillery.Solar had generated as much as a quarter of Gaza’s electricity, representing one of the world’s highest shares, but most panels, and the territory’s only power plant, have been damaged or destroyed. Gaza’s limited access to electricity now mostly relies on diesel-guzzling generators that emitted just over 130,000 tons of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, or 7% of the total conflict emissions.More than 40% of the total emissions were generated by the estimated 70,000 aid trucks Israel allowed into the Gaza Strip – which the UN has condemned as grossly insufficient to meet the basic humanitarian needs of 2.2m displaced and starving Palestinians.Two bar charts showing greenhouse gas emissions from the first 15 months of conflict. The first shows that over 90% of emissions from the Israel-Gaza region conflict comes from reconstruction. The remaining share is from direct war related activities. The second chart breaks down those emissions, ranging from Gaza aid delivery (817k metric tons of CO2 equivalent) and cargo flights (556k), to much smaller totals from other regional conflicts like Israel-Iran (5k).But the most significant climate cost will come from rebuilding Gaza, which Israel has reduced to an estimated 60m tonnes of toxic rubble.The carbon cost of trucking out debris and then rebuilding 436,000 apartments, 700 schools, mosques, clinics, government offices and other buildings, as well as 5km of Gaza’s roads, will generate an estimated 29.4m tonnes eCO2. This is on a par with the entire 2023 emissions generated by Afghanistan.The reconstruction figure islower than previous estimates by the same research groupdue to a revision in the average size of apartment blocks.“This report is a staggering and sobering reminder of the ecological and environmental cost of Israel’s genocidal campaign on the planet and its besieged people,” saidZena Agha, policy analystfor Palestinian policy network Al-Shabaka.“But this is also the US, UK and EU’s war, all of which have provided seemingly limitless military resources to enable Israel to devastate the most densely populated place on the planet. This brings home the destabilising [regional] impact of the Israeli settler state and its inseparability from the western military-industrial complex.”The war on Gaza has also provoked bloody regional tensions. The study found:The Houthis in Yemen launched an estimated 400 rockets into Israel between October 2023 and January 2025, generating about 55 tCO2e. Israel’s aerial response generated almost 50 times more planet warming greenhouse gases. Aprevious studyfound that shipping emissions rose by an estimated 63% after the Houthis blocked the Red Sea corridor, forcing cargo ships to take longer routes.A conservative estimate of emissions from two large-scale exchanges of missiles between Israel and Iran topped 5,000 tCO2e, with more than 80% down to Israel.In Lebanon, more than 90% of the estimated 3,747 tCO2e generated by sporadic exchanges came from IDF bombs, with only 8% linked to Hezbollah rockets. The carbon cost of reconstructing 3,600 homes destroyed in southern Lebanon is almost as high as the annual emissions from the island of St Lucia.A bar chart showing how emissions related to the Israel-Gaza conflict are similar to Zimbabwe and Afghanistan.The study is based on evolving methodology known as a scope 3+ framework which seeks to capture direct and indirect wartime emissions currently missing from global climate and conflict audits. This can include soil degradation, fires, infrastructure damage, displacement of people, aid, rerouting cargo ships and civil aviation.Researchers relied on open-source information, media reports, and data from independent aid groups such as UN agencies. The true environmental costs are almost certainly higher given Israel’s media blockade, with data on razed farmland, desertification, remediation, and fires among other carbon-intense impacts hard to obtain.“This conflict in Gaza shows that the numbers are substantial, greater than the entire greenhouse gas emissions of many entire countries, and must be included for accurate climate change and mitigation targets,” said Frederick Otu-Larbi, co-author, senior teaching associate at Lancaster Environment Centre and lecturer at University of Energy and Natural Resources in Ghana.“Militaries need to reckon with the fact that their own national security and operational capacity is being compromised due to a changing climate of their own making,” said Ben Neimark, senior lecturer at Queen Mary University of London and study co-author.Previous research has found that military emissions rise with spending and buildup.Israel’s military budget surged in 2024 to $46.5bn – the largest increase in the world,according to theStockholm International Peace Research Institute. Based on one methodology, Israel’s baseline military emissions last year – excluding direct conflict and reconstruction climate costs – rose to 6.5m tCO2e. This is more than the entire carbon footprint of Eritrea, a country of 3.5 million people.Yet under current UN rules, reporting military emission data is voluntary and limited to fuel use, despite the fact the climate cost of the destruction of Gaza will be felt globally. The IDF, like most militaries worldwide, has never reported emission figures to the UN.Hadeel Ikhmais, head of the climate change office at the Palestinian Environmental Quality Authority, said: “Wars not only kill people but also release toxic chemicals, destroy infrastructure, pollute soil, air and water resources and accelerate climate and environmental disasters. War also destroys climate adaptation and hinders environmental management. Not counting carbon emissions is a black hole in accountability that allows governments to get away from their environmental crimes.”Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warClimate crisisGazaPalestinian territoriesIsraelMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

A set of loosely interconnected conflicts – led by Russia’s continued assault on Ukraine and its related shadow war in Europe, and Israel’s seemingly unending war on Hamas, which may lead to an attack on Iran – have not at all been restrained by a skittish White House with little interest in helping to promote peace in Europe.One of the three-strong review team is Fiona Hill, who was briefly and famously an adviser to Donald Trump in his first term. She is so worried about the disintegration of postwar norms that she believes the world is drifting towards a “scenario that you had in world war one” where, in the run-up to the war, “suddenly all these different interests and these different conflicts became, you know, basically intertwined with each other, [and] it becomes extraordinarily hard to disentangle”.Solving problems like these is likely to be beyond the ability of the 130-page document, jointly written by Hill, George Robertson, a former Nato secretary general, and Richard Barrons, a retired British army general. But its remit has been helped by the fact that difficult decisions about which equipment programmes to invest in and to cut have been deferred to a separate command paper in the autumn. Meanwhile, headline budgets to increase defence spending to 2.5% of GDP by 2027 have already been announced by the prime minister, in February.“What I’m expecting is that it’s basically going to be an essay,” said Lawrence Friedman, a military strategy expert and emeritus professor at King’s College London. Even so, the defence review has been rewritten several times since it was first completed in the spring, partly as a result of drafting battles across Whitehall. Another document – a national security strategy from Keir Starmer’s national security adviser, Jonathan Powell – is due out in June.In the past, defence reviews have done a poor job of prediction. Boris’s Johnson’s 2021 integrated review, published in the aftermath of Brexit, emphasised a British tilt to the far-off Indo-Pacific, supported by occasional flag-flying visits from the Royal Navy’s two new aircraft carriers that cost £6.2bn. But with Britain pouring more than £3bn a year of arms into Ukraine, the last review’s goal to have a “greater and more persistent presence” than any other European country in the Indo-Pacific looks irrelevant.This review’s principal task is likely to be descriptive, though it runs into two difficulties: people and money.Statistics out this weekshow again that more people are leaving the military than joining. Army numbers are at a 300-year low of 70,860, down 2.3% over the past year, despite the backdrop of the war in Ukraine. The numbers of RAF and naval personnel have fallen by similar proportions, meaning that, according to one naval source, the navy can crew only four of its six Type 45 destroyers.The news flow around service life is dominated by stories about rape, sexual harassment and sexism across the military. Internal reviews over the last two years acknowledged misogyny and misconduct in theRed Arrowsand thesubmarine service. In an inquest into the death of 19-year-oldGunner Jaysley Beckin February, the court found she killed herself after being assaulted and subsequently subjected to unwanted sexual attention. Itprompted an outpouring of reportson online forums and social media from mostly female soldiers describing similar negative experiences.A commitment will be made in the defence review to invest a further £1.5bn in military accommodation, including urgent renovation for the 1,000 worst homes, a longstanding source of complaint. But in recent years the British military has had relatively few positive stories to tell, not least because it has been relatively inactive on operations, with the fraught rescue from Kabul in August 2021 the most significant recent effort. It was followed by the smaller airlift of 2,450 Britons and other western nationals from Sudan in the spring of 2023 as a civil war broke out.Although Labour promised a modest increase in defence spending in February, amounting to £5.3bn a year in real terms when the increase from the current 2.33% of GDP to the promised 2.5% goes through, theMinistry of Defence(MoD) has an extraordinary capacity to soak up money. A former senior insider estimated that the MoD faced £5bn of cost pressures for next year, partly as a consequence of higher pay settlements announced by Labour, such as this year’s 4.5%. There remains £16.9bn of unfunded commitments in the MoD’s 10-year equipment plan.Spending on nuclear weapons is rising sharply: analysis by Steve Barwick, of Rethinking Security, concluded that the forecast cost of MoD’s Defence Nuclear Organisation’s 10-year equipment plan increased by 62% to £99.5bn in 2023. The most recent figure, for 2025, was more than £100bn, according to the MoD. At the same time, the challenge of maintaining the UK’s ageing fleet of Vanguard submarines, which carry the Trident nuclear armed missiles, means individual patrol boats are undertaking record missions underwater, the last of which was 204 days long – more than nine months.A more immediate problem for the British military is how to resource and sustain a commitment to participate in a European-led “reassurance force” for Ukraine, currently promised in the event of a durable ceasefire, if Russia can be persuaded to agree. A British contribution might amount to a brigade of a few thousand, as well as some command and control functions, though finding the troop numbers is likely to be a stretch, suggesting there will be more calls for extra spending.“To be credible, the defence review needs to be backed by a cast-iron commitment to take defence spending to 3% of GDP by a specific date and 3.5% by 2035,” argued Peter Ricketts, a former national security adviser. But while no extra money is expected immediately, the financial debate may be moved forward not by the review but by Nato and Trump by the end of the month.Alliance members are considering a proposal from Mark Rutte, Nato’s secretary general, to be tabled at its June summit in The Hague, to increase core defence spending to 3.5% by 2032, with a further 1.5% on cyber and transport and other military-related infrastructure. That would match Trump’s demand that Nato members spend 5% of GDP on defence. “I assume that in The Hague we will agree on a high defence spend target of in total 5%,” Rutte said this week.Explore more on these topicsDefence policyMinistry of DefenceMilitaryanalysisShareReuse this content"

Instead, it will reiterate a commitment made by Starmer in February to increase thedefence budgetto 2.5% of GDP by 2027 and to 3% in the next parliament.But it is likely to be used to help justify a significant expansion in medium-term defence spending that is expected to be agreed at the Nato summit later in June that could amount to more than £50bn in real terms.Members of the western alliance are discussing a proposal to increase core defence spending to 3.5% of GDP by 2032, with a further 1.5% for cyber and infrastructure initiatives, in response to pressure from Donald Trump.This week Mark Rutte, Nato’s secretary general, said he expected the June summit in The Hague would see allies agree on “a high defence spend target” of 5% in total, including a figure “considerably north of 3%” on pure defence spending.The review is also expected to refer to the question of the size of the British army, amid reports that theMinistry of Defenceand Treasury have been battling over whether to include a commitment to increase numbers from the target of 73,000.Figures out this week show that the size of the army has dropped below the target to the lowest level since the Napoleonic era and earlier, with the number of full-time trained soldiers at 70,860 on 1 April, down 2.3% over the preceding year.A military source said the defence secretary, John Healey, a persistent critic of falling army size in opposition, had won a commitment to increase the army by a few thousand, but the Ministry of Defence said it did not recognise the speculation.A commitment to increase army numbers by 5,000, if the recruitment can be achieved, would cost about £2.5bn a year in extra pay, accommodation, kit and other resources. But if successful, it would help the military be able to meet what are likely to be growing overseas commitments in the years ahead.Britain and France have agreed to lead a multinational “reassurance force” of up to 30,000 to help keep the peace in Ukraine and keep its air and seaports open if Russia signs up to a durable ceasefire, though so far Vladimir Putin has been unwilling to do so, despite pleas from Trump to stop the war.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Iran has emerged as a supplier of drones to Russia while China provides components for weapons – and North Korea has sent troops to fight against Ukraine.Starmer is expected to unveil the outline review at an event on Monday before Healey lays the full document before parliament.Explore more on these topicsDefence policyMinistry of DefenceMilitarynewsShareReuse this content"

Should it go, replacing it will be impossible,” he said.The centre has been locked ina funding disputewith its local authority, North Northamptonshire, in recent years. The council’s previous Tory leadership made no bones aboutits disdainfor Pen Green, cutting its funding from £1m to £300,000 in 2022 despite widespread public opposition.The survival of Pen Green, which is in Corby, an economically deprived post-industrial corner of a mainly affluent county, is being seen as an early test for the council’s Reform leadership, whichtook powerafter May’s local elections.North Northamptonshire’s leader, Martin Griffiths, who was a Tory council leader in neighbouring Wellingborough before switching to Reform, has previously visited the centre and is understood to have been impressed by its services.In a statement, the council paid tribute to Pen Green and said it would “endeavour” to help it: “In relation to the previous Sure Start scheme, it was extremely respected and successful, and crucially it was funded centrally. When this was withdrawn, the initiative ceased.“We would welcome long-term centrally funded initiatives to invest in our children, young people and communities … [our] finances are challenging, and our statutory responsibilities have priority. If theLabourgovernment can provide the finances to run initiatives such as Sure Start then they would be viewed favourably by this council.”Maintained nurseries are funded by Department for Education grants but councils have discretion over how the money is shared. Pen Green argues its problems arose when the previous regime chose to redirect extra funding traditionally earmarked for the centre to other nurseries in the county.The education secretary, Bridget Phillipson, visited Pen Green three years ago. She is also believed to be an admirer of the centre, which was created in the early 1980s in a disused primary school and provides integrated nursery, health, family support and social care services for about 1,000 children under five each year.The centre, which is hugely popular locally, has trained thousands of early years professionals, operates a thriving research centre, and attracts hundreds of visitors a year from all over the world seeking to learn from its approach.Lee Barron, the Labour MP for Corby and East Northamptonshire, said: “Pen Green really is the jewel in the crown as far as children’s centres are concerned. It epitomises Labour values and it is something I will fight to protect.”While No 10 and Phillipson recognise Sure Start’s popularity, especially with Labour voters, she has in the pastdownplayedthe prospects of a return to the programme’s generously funded glory days, saying change “will not come simply from winding back the clock”.A key Labour mission is to ensure all children, especially those from deprived backgrounds, are“school ready”by the time they reach primary age in areas such as language development, social skills and even teeth brushing – ambitions that children’s centres such as Pen Green argue are at the core of the services they provide.Recent research has found thelong-term impacts of Sure Startwere positive and cost-effective, producing better health, education and social care outcomes for families who enrolled in the programme during the 2000s.At its peak in 2009-10 there were 3,600 Sure Start centres in England, before austerity cuts reduced government funding by two-thirds, with local authoritiesscaling back or closing most of the centresby 2018.Explore more on these topicsEarly years educationChildrenNorthamptonshireCuts and closuresReform UKLabourSocial exclusionnewsShareReuse this content"

As an official gift to Charles as head of state, the car will become part of the royal mews to be used on official occasions and not for private use, sources indicated. The Bahraini king also gave Charles a decorative clock.The feather crown was a present from Amazonian Indigenous leaders, and the traditional South Pacific coconut leaf hats were from the president of the Marshall Islands. There were plenty of trees, too, from tree saplings given by the Swedish royal family to a Tirolean pine tree from the Austrian president.Other coronation gifts included a table and a model ship from the emir of Kuwait; a decorative pot from the sultan of Brunei; and, from the then US president, Joe Biden, a leather folder containing printed letters betweenQueen Elizabeth IIand President Dwight D Eisenhower inviting the latter to the UK, with a photograph of the visit.View image in fullscreenKing Charles with King Hamad Bin Isa al-Khalifa of Bahrain at Windsor Castle in November last year.Photograph: Aaron Chown/PAThe late queen received a trio of brooches among other gifts for her platinum jubilee – a white gold, platinum and diamond brooch from the Goldsmiths’ Company, a diamond and platinum brooch from the Freemasons, and a platinum pearl and diamond brooch from the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic. The jewellery will become part of the royal collection and may be worn by other members of the royal family.Two lamp-posts outside the Houses of Parliament in the form of bronze sculptures of heraldic beasts were presented by both houses for the jubilee. China’s president, Xi Jinping, sent a large cloisonné ornament in the design of azun, a wine vessel used in ancient Chinese rituals, with motifs and patterns symbolising royalty and good fortune.The Australian air force in 2021 sent the queen a practical gift of six dog jackets of varying sizes. Joe and Jill Biden, on the occasion of having tea at Windsor Castle, contributed an engraved specially commissioned Tiffany sterling silver box and a floral brooch.Gifts received byQueen Camillainclude lapis lazuli gemstones from Hamid Karzai, the former president of Afghanistan, and a brooch from the crown prince of Kuwait.This is the first official gifts register to be published in the king’s reign and dates back to 2020. Normally the list is published on the royal family website annually, but the Covid pandemic, the death of Elizabeth and the coronation led to delays.Gifts cannot be sold or exchanged and eventually become part of the royal collection, which is held in trust for successors and the nation.Explore more on these topicsKing Charles coronationMonarchyKing Charles IIIQueen Elizabeth IIQueen's platinum jubileeQueen CamillanewsShareReuse this content"

We protected the economy in a time of crisis nearly 17 years ago, now we are focused on securing Britain’s future in a new era of global change.”The government has now exited all of the banks it helped bail out during the financial crisis, the Treasury said.RBS became a symbol of the UK banking sector’s implosion during the 2008 global financial crisis, with public ire focusing on itsaggressive expansion under the former chief executive Fred “The Shred” Goodwin. Goodwin was stripped of his knighthood in 2012, but is now estimated to be receiving a pensionworth nearly £600,000 per year.In 2007 RBS led a consortium to buy the Dutch bank ABN Amro for £49bn – a huge sum at the top of the market. It was then the largest deal in financial services history, and for a short period made RBS the world’s biggest bank. With £2.2tn in assets, it was more than double the size of the UK economy.Executives’ excessive spending, which extended to private jets and a lavish £350m campus outside Edinburgh, also stretched the bank’s finances just as the sector was facing a credit crunch.RBS was eventually forced to take a state bailout in October 2008, with the taxpayer eventually injecting £45bn into the lender, without which millions of customers’ savings would have been put at risk.It left the government with an 84% stake in the banking group, leading to years of government austerity that many blame for hollowing out public services across the country.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

NatWest alsofast-tracked the processthrough multibillion-pound share buybacks.That process is now completed, bringing NatWest back into full private ownership nearly two decades after taxpayers saved it from the brink.NatWest chief executive, Paul Thwaite, said: “This is a significant moment for NatWest Group, for all those who work here and for the UK more widely.

He cited no evidence for either claim.Legal experts, including Eric Columbus, a former litigator for the January 6 select committee,suggestedTrump does not have the power to fire Sajet, since the gallery is part of the Smithsonian, which is not run by the executive branch.In its collection of portraits of American presidents, the gallery had this text about Trump: “Impeached twice, on charges of abuse of power and incitement of insurrection after supporters attacked the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, he was acquitted by the Senate in both trials. After losing to Joe Biden in 2020, Trump mounted a historic comeback in the 2024 election. He is the only president aside from Grover Cleveland (1837-1908) to have won a nonconsecutive second term.”Sajet arrived in the US with her family in 1997, held positions at the Philadelphia Museum of Art, the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, and the Historical Society of Pennsylvania andwas appointed directorof the National Portrait Gallery in 2013,according to a Guardian profile of her.‘It reminds you of a fascist state’: Smithsonian Institution braces for Trump rewrite of US historyRead moreThe National Portrait Gallery is an art museum in Washington DC that opened in 1968 and is part of theSmithsonian Institution.

The Doge influence will only grow stronger. I liken it to a sort of person of Buddhism – it’s like a way of life,” he said.Trump was effusive in his praise of the world’s richest man, saying Musk “delivered a colossal change in the old ways of doing business in Washington” and calling Doge “the most sweeping and consequential government reform program in generations”.The president presented Musk with a golden key to the White House to mark his service.“He willingly accepted the outrageous abuse and slander and lies and attacks, because he does love our country. I know that very much,” Trump said.Their joint appearance came hours afterthe New York Times publisheda story detailing Musk’s use of ketamine, ecstasy and psychedelic mushrooms while campaigning for Trump last year. In the Oval Office, Musk wore a black cap and suit jacket over a T-shirt, while also sporting a bruise around his right eye he said was caused by his young son punching him while they were “horsing around”.Conceived on the campaign trail not long after Musk endorsed Trump’s bid to return to the White House, Doge wasestablished by an executive orderthe president signed hours after being sworn in. Its staffers, many who are young and have ties to Musk but little to no government service, then fanned out across federal agencies, cancelling out budget items and directing the terminations of employees.An initial goal to cut $2tn in government spending became $1tn by the time Trump was sworn in – nonetheless a hefty sum that the president characterized as a necessary component of his promised “golden age” of lower taxes, leaner government and stricter immigration enforcement.Labor unions and Democrats protested against Doge’s mass firings and warned that its unorthodox efforts to coax federal workers out of their jobs and gather information about their work would undermine government operations. The initiative made its presence known via emails that became infamous, such as the “fork in the road” deferred resignation offerings, or a short-lived demand that staff across departmentssubmit a detailed listof their accomplishments.Doge had a hand in the firings of thousands of probationary workers and the dismantling of US Agency for International Development (USAID), both actions sparking court challenges. As the initiative picked up steam in February, Musk appeared at a prominent conservative conference wielding a chainsaw that he declared “is for bureaucracy!”Yet the aggressive pace of cost-cutting sparked blunders, such as when the administrationscrambled to hire backprobationary employees let go from the agency overseeing nuclear weapons. Vandals motivated by antipathy towards Musk begantargeting Tesla vehicles and dealerships, and reports emerged that his romp through the federal government has enraged Trump’s newly confirmed cabinet secretaries.Doge’s public-facing website detailing its cuts became known for errors, but currently says it has only saved $175bn – much less than Musk’s goal.“We do expect to achieve over time the trillion dollars of savings,” Musk said in the Oval Office. “Say, by the middle of next year, with the support of the president and Congress, could we achieve a trillion dollars of savings? I think so. We’re on track to do so.”Republicans in Congress are expected to attempt to codify Doge’s cuts when they consider appropriations bills as part of the next federal fiscal year’s budget. As for Musk, he said he would “continue to be visiting here and be a friend and adviser to the president”.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpElon MuskUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Colbert was charged with second-degree murder while White was arrested on robbery and fraud charges stemming from Manzano’s death.In a statement, Kenner police said that a car used by Colbert on the day of Manzano’s death had been rented under Anderson’s name. Police also said that additional evidence showed Anderson “provided logistical support, engaged in post-crime communication, and assisted in attempts to financially benefit from the victim’s stolen assets”, including Manzano’s credit card.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines USFree newsletterGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He was being held at the jail in Jefferson parish,Louisiana, which includes Kenner, alongside Colbert and White, according to lockup records.Manzano, a reporter based in Kansas City, Missouri, was found suffocated while lying face down on a pillow.

We look back on his tenureNick Robins-EarlyandRachel LeingangFri 30 May 2025 07.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 30 May 2025 07.01 EDTShareIn his 130 days as a special government employee, the world’s richest man slashed his way through federal agencies, laying off government employees and gaining access to data that will underpin a dismantling of the federal government.Elon Musk’s role in theTrump administrationis without modern precedent. Here’s a look at some key moments in the brief tenure Musk had as a federal employee.20 JanuaryInauguration and an infamous saluteMusk is at Trump’s side, as are a host of other tech billionaires, as he is inaugurated. He also issues anapparent fascist-style saluteon stage at an inauguration celebration, twice.20 JanuaryDoge is createdThe president issues anexecutive orderthat creates Musk’s “department of government efficiency” by renaming the United States Digital Service agency, which previously handled governmental tech issues. Trump’s order includes only a vague mandate to modernize government technology and increase efficiency, but within days it becomes clear Musk and his team have far more expansive aims.January and FebruaryDoge makes its way across governmentMusk and Doge pop up at the offices of numerous government agencies, starting with the General Services Administration, to question federal employees and start gathering data and access to government systems.28 JanuaryMass layoffs, ‘fork in the road’, and buyouts beginDoge’s early days make headlines for targeting masses of government workers with layoffs and pushing others to resign, with more than 2 million employeesreceiving an emailtitled “Fork in the road” that encourages staffers to take a buyout. The emails, which ask, “What did you accomplish this week?” become a signature of Musk and his new bureau, sent again and again whenever staff began to prey on a new herd of government employees.Early FebruaryUSAID is gutted and workers stand up to MuskAs Doge staffers storm into the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) in early February, they find themselves in aheated standoffwith security officials who try to bar them from accessing a secure room which holds sensitive and confidential data. The confrontation ends with USAID’s top security official being put on administrative leave, while Doge gains access to its systems. With no one to stop them, Doge staffers begin the process ofhollowing out the agencythat had once been the world’s largest single supplier of humanitarian aid. More than 5,600 USAID workers around the worldare firedin the ensuing weeks.“We spent the weekend feedingUSAIDinto the wood chipper,” Musk boasts days later on X, his social media platform.3 FebruaryMusk says he deletes key government software creatorMusk tells a rightwing influencer on X that the GSA’s 18F office, which helped build software projects such as the IRS’s free tax filing service, was “deleted” in response to an inaccurate post accusing the group of being radical leftists.13 FebruaryMusk says he needs to ‘delete’ government agencies“We do need to delete entire agencies,” Musktellsattenders at a World Governments Summit in Dubai. “If we don’t remove the roots of the weed, then it’s easy for the weed to grow back.”13 FebruaryProbationary workers are firedThe Trump administrationorders agencies to fire thousandsof probationary workers – a designation that applies to employees who have been at their jobs for less than a year, including those who may have been recently promoted. Other workers soon receive an email from Doge that demand theylist five thingsthey did last week or face termination, a chaotic request that also turns out to be an empty threat.Cabinet officialsprivatelydeem it nonsensical.15 FebruaryProtesters target TeslaA “Tesla takedown” protest movement and boycott starts taking off, targeting Musk’s car company with protests at dealerships. A protest on this date in New York City at a showroom has a solid turnout.23 FebruaryMusk gloats at conservative conferenceAt the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), Musk stands on stage in a black Maga hat, sunglasses and gold chain, gleefullywielding a chainsawthat was gifted to him by Javier Milei, the rightwing Argentinian president.“This chainsaw is for bureaucracy!” he says. “I am become meme.”1 March18F workers laid offIn the middle of the night, workers at 18F are notified that they will be laid off en masse.Early MarchCourts start to block some Doge actionsCourt cases filed earlier in Trump’s term begin producing rulings that curtail Doge’s layoffs and temporarily block its access to data. Judges rule that the Trump administrationneeds to reinstateprobationary workers they fired,limit some Doge accessto databases at agencies such as the Social Security Administration, andorder Musk’s teamto turn over internal records it had been seeking to keep private.Mid-MarchHealth department slashedThe Department of Health and Human Servicesannouncesit is cutting 10,000 jobs to align with Trump’s executive order on Doge. In a display of the chaos that Doge had inspired, the US health secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr, weeks later admits about 2,000 of those workerswere fired in errorand would need to be reinstated.Mid-MarchWhite House tries to salvage Tesla’s reputationThe Tesla protests are working – stocks are falling. In response,Trump appearson the White House driveway in front of several parked Teslas, telling reporters he is going to buy one of them and praising Musk as a “patriot”. Others in Trump’s orbit, including the Fox News host Sean Hannity, also post sales pitches for the automaker.20 MarchMusk attacks courts as they try to curb administrative actionsMusk’s reaction to court rulings against Trump is a constant stream ofattacks against the judicial systemon X, which includedemandsthat lawmakers “impeach the judges” and claims there is a “judicial coup” under way against Trump. Musk repeatedly amplifies far-right influencers saying the US should emulate El Salvador’s strongman president, Nayib Bukele, whoseparty oustedsupreme court judges in 2021 in a slide toward authoritarianism.30 MarchTesla and Musk protests builds steam around the worldA fully fledged international protest movement against Tesla and Musk is building. Thousands of peoplegather at showroomsfrom Sydney to San Francisco in a day of action, with organizers stating that “hurting Tesla is stopping Musk”. Vandalism against Tesla dealerships, charging stations and cars alsointensifies around the world, including multiplemolotov cocktail attacksandincidents of arson.Trump and Musk call the attacks domestic terrorism, while Pam Bondi, the attorney general,vows to crack downon anyone targeting Tesla.1 AprilWisconsin supreme court race delivers Musk rebukeMusk poured money into a Wisconsin supreme court race that would have tilted the swing state’s high court toward conservatives. He and his groups spent more than $20m on this race, including a giveaway of $1m checks on stage. Susan Crawford, the Democrat, wins the race handily, showing Musk’s money couldn’t buy everything.22 AprilPoor Tesla performance forces Musk to refocusA first-quarter earnings call reveals Tesla’s performancewas even worsethan expectations, with a 71% drop in profits and 9% drop in revenue year over year. Musk announces he will spendsignificantly less timeworking on Doge starting some time in May.30 AprilMusk’s hat performance at cabinet meetingIn a cabinet meeting, Musk puts on two literal hats – a “dark Maga” hat covered by a “Gulf of America” hat. After Trump compliments the double-caps, Musk jokes: “They say I wear a lot of hats”. This is potentially Musk’s final cabinet meeting.MayMusk starts to fade from political limelightMay finds a less vocal Musk than the aggressive tone he took the rest of the year, providing fuel for protests and lost revenue for Tesla.27 MayMusk starts to signal departure from TrumpAs Congress debates Trump’s “big, beautiful bill” that would slash government services, Musk says he’s “disappointed” by the bill because it doesn’t cut enough on domestic policy.“I think a bill can be big or it can be beautiful. But I don’t know if it can be both,” he tells CBS.30 MayMusk’s exit leaves government permanently changedMusk’s time as a special government employee comes to an end, capping off the 130 days he is allowed to serve in this role.Explore more on these topicsElon MuskDonald TrumpTrump administrationUS politicsexplainersShareReuse this content"

All of the music I’ve ever made … now belongs … to me.”She originallylost the rights in 2019when her first record label, Big Machine, sold them to music executive Scooter Braun. Swift described the sale to Braun as her “worst case scenario”, and said she had not been given the opportunity to buy her work outright, but to “earn” one album back for each new album she recorded for the label. Her subsequent albums, from 2019’s Lover onwards, were released on Republic, with Swift retaining the rights to the master recordings.Braun at one time managed Kanye West, who repeatedly targeted Swift after he infamouslyinvaded her acceptance speechat the 2009 VMA awards. In November 2020, Braun sold the master recordings to the private equity firm Shamrock Capital in November for a reported $300m.In a letter to fans posted today, Swift said that she bought her masters – as well as her videos, concert films, album art and photography and unreleased songs – back from Shamrock. The Guardian understands that previous rumours that it cost Swift between $600m and $1bn are inaccurately high.As was customary for record deals at the time, Swift’s arrangement with Big Machine meant that they owned her master recordings, hence she did not own them at the point of sale. In her letter, she wrote: “All I’ve ever wanted was the opportunity to work hard enough to be able to one day purchase my music outright with no strings attached, no partnership, with full autonomy.“I will be forever grateful to everyone at Shamrock Capital for being the first people to ever offer this to me. The way they’ve handled every interaction we’ve had has been honest, fair and respectful. This was a business deal to them, but I really felt like they saw it for what it was to me: my memories and my sweat and my handwriting and my decades of dreams. I am endlessly thankful. My first tattoo might just be a huge shamrock in the middle of my forehead.”Swift credited the support of her fans with enabling her to buy back her music. “I can’t thank you enough for helping to reunite me with this art that I have dedicated my life to, but have never owned until now.”In order to regain control over her catalogue after the original sale to Braun – and to devalue his investment – Swift embarked on a project to rerecord all six albums, branding each one “(Taylor’s Version)” and adding “From the Vault” tracks from the original songwriting sessions that hadn’t made it on to the original albums.Between 2021 and 2023, Swift rerecorded her albumsFearless(originally released in 2008),Red(2012),Speak Now(2010) and1989(2014).As the principal songwriter, she has the right to rerecord the material and to block any use of the original recordings. Several rerecorded songs made their debuts in film and TV syncs: last week, the new version of Look What You Made Me Do – from the as-yet unreleased rerecording of 2017’s Reputation – appeared in the new series of The Handmaid’s Tale.Reputation and Swift’s self-titled debut album, from 2006, are the only albums not to be rerecorded. Fans have been speculating as to their possible release dates for years, leaping on the colours of her outfits and what they perceive to be clues in her limited social media posts to deduce when they would appear.Now that Swift has reacquired her master recordings, there is less reason to proceed with the rerecordings.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSleeve NotesFree weekly newsletterGet music news, bold reviews and unexpected extras.

What about Rep TV?” she wrote, calling the record by its fan nickname. “Full transparency: I haven’t even rerecorded a quarter of it. The Reputation album was so specific to that time in my life, and I kept hitting a stopping point when I tried to remake it.”Reputation – which Swift recently called a “goth-punk moment of female rage at being gaslit by an entire social structure” – was born of a time when her public image had tanked in the wake of a feud with Kanye West and accusations of overexposure.“All that defiance, that longing to be understood while feeling purposely misunderstood, that desperate hope, that shame-born snarl and mischief. To be perfectly honest, it’s the one album in those first six that I thought couldn’t be improved upon by redoing it. Not the music, or photos, or videos. So I kept putting it off.”Swift told fans that they might yet hear the unreleased Reputation From the Vault tracks, “if you’re into the idea”. She confirmed that she had rerecorded her debut. “I really love how it sounds now. Those two albums can still have their moments to re-emerge when the time is right, if that would be something you guys would be excited about. But if it happens, it won’t be from a place of sadness and longing for what I wish I could have. It will just be a celebration now.”One suspects she will release the records, or what exists of them: the essential redundancy of the project is unlikely to thwart its potentially vast commercial impact. The four previously released rerecordings broke commercial and chart records for Swift: in the UK alone, 1989 (Taylor’s Version) clocked higher first-week combined streams and sales – 184,000 – than the original total of 90,000 a decade earlier.Taylor-made deals: how artists are following Swift’s rights exampleRead moreThe rerecordings were interspersed with a run of new, original recordings. Swift has released four albums since 2020: her lockdown sister records Folklore and Evermore (2020), as well as Midnights (2022) andThe Tortured Poets Department(2024).Swift’s monumentally successful catalogue was showcased on her Eras tour, which travelled the world between 2023 and 2024, became the first ever billion dollar-grossing tour, and eventually grossed more than $2bn in total. The show was divided into album-specific segments, andupdated when it hit Europein 2024 to include a new Tortured Poets section.Swift concluded her letter by referencing the industry-wide conversations about artist rights that her saga had kickstarted. These days, it is far more common, particularly for young female artists, to own their masters than it was for the teenage Swift in 2006.“Every time a new artist tells me they negotiated to own their master recordings in their record contract because of this fight, I’m reminded of how important it was for all of this to happen. Thank you for being curious about something that used to be thought of as too industry-centric for broad discussion. You’ll never know how much it means to me that you cared. Every single bit of it counted and ended us up here.”Explore more on these topicsTaylor SwiftPop and rockMusic industrynewsShareReuse this content"

Other organisations, including local trade unions, have stepped in to help make up the shortfall, but Modeste told the Guardian he was deeply worried about the celebration’s future.Pride Toronto loses corporate funding as Trump’s DEI purge has chilling effectRead more“Am I going to have to drastically cut what the festival looks like for 2026? This is not the place that I want to be in,” he said.Home Depot told the Guardian it continually reviews its non-profit giving and decided not to contribute this year. Google told the newspaper it would be supporting “Toronto Googlers” marching in the parade and “community moments” from Pride.The sudden exit of Google and Home Depot follows the departure in February ofthree other prominent sponsors. At the time, Modeste did not name them, but on Friday he revealed that they were Nissan, Adidas and Clorox.NissanCanadasaid it was unable to sponsor Pride in Toronto due to a “local decision” that it says was based on a reevaluation of marketing and media activities. Adidas and Clorox have been approached for comment.“These are American companies and they are showing their true colours,” said Modeste. “We thought they were with the community, but clearly, they’re not.”Corporate sponsorship not only goes towards paying staff, but hundreds of local artists and to keepPrideas a free event.Modeste said he grew up in a period before widespread Pride celebrations – and did not want that to be the experience of current younger generations. “I don’t want to be the one to have to make that decision, to take Pride away from the community,” he said.The White House’s condemnation of diversity and inclusion efforts has resulted in corporations shirking away from festivals that they once loudly supported, said Sui Sui, a professor at Toronto Metropolitan University whose research focuses on DEI initiatives.Sui said that the move also signals that commitments large sponsors made in the past were tenuous and motivated not because of genuine support, but because of the perceived profitability of aligning with such causes.Scared advertisers, flag bans and Trump: the US is in for a troubled Pride 2025Read moreThemonths-long purgeof US federal government workers by the Trump administration has resulted in the firings of tens of thousands of people, including those who worked in forwarding diversity and equity initiatives.Sui said that the chill aroundsponsors for pride eventshas also affectedNew York City and Philadelphia.

Several, in fact.Someone alerted me that a memecoin called Dork Nerd Geek ($DNG) had been minted with a picture of my face, and it already had a market cap (the total value of all coins in circulation) of $29,000. Twenty minutes later it was $100,000. An hour later it was $800,000.I had no idea what was going on, but I did know that “Dork Nerd Geek” was the nicknameAndrew Tategave me because I’ve spent much of my journalistic careerinvestigating allegations of human traffickingmade against him.I noticed he was currently livestreaming to his followers. I opened up his live stream and, for the first time, bore witness to the insane volatility of the memecoin market.In the space of 10 minutes, dozens of new me-related memecoins were being minted, including “Disgraced News Gatherer”, “Matt Shea is a faggot,” and “Take My Wife Tate (CUCK),” the latter of which included a picture of my fiancee taken from Instagram. Tate was pumping some of these memecoins in value merely by talking about them, with market fluctuations happening in real time on the order of millions, based on his every word.Two seconds after he said the words “Fuck Matt Shea,” a coin called “FUCK MATT SHAE [sic]” soared in value. Twenty minutes later, he uttered the words “Fuck Matt Shea … ” again and it went even higher, only to drop back down to nothing when he finished his sentence with “… is not a generational asset”. He then said he would pump the coin after taking a piss. He walked offscreen to urinate. It rocketed.View image in fullscreenA memecoin inspired by the writer, Matt Shea, as it was listed on one exchange.Photograph: Matt SheaSoon, there were hundreds more Matt Shea memecoins with similar names, as his followers tried to trick people into thinking thattheirMatt Shea memecoin was the one Tate was pumping. His words became memecoins, those memecoins shot up in value, and then the value disappeared instantaneously.All in all, about $2m was spent by people on memecoins making fun of me in the span of a few hours, and hundreds of millions more on other coins he mentioned during the stream.By the end of his live stream, the value of all the coins he pumped was back to near zero. All the fans who had invested at his behest collectively would have lost hundreds of millions of dollars.His followers may have felt they were in on the joke, but in the end they mostly lost their money. Only a tiny number of wallets actually profited from the coin including onecryptothat made a profit of $240,000.‘Roadmap for corruption’: Trump dive into cryptocurrency raises ethics alarmRead moreA number of online crypto investigators includingCoffeezilla,bored2boar,StarPlatinumand others have found that Tate has manipulated memecoin markets using “pump and dump”-like schemes, leading to large profits for those within his inner circle. We put the allegations in these investigations to Tate’s team, who said they had no comment.What happened on Tate’s stream that day felt bizarre but I didn’t completely understand what I was witnessing. I thought I basically understood bitcoin, but how do memecoins differ, and why do they continue to be popular when so many people have lost money on them?Is every memecoin a scam?According to David Gerard, the author of Attack of the 50 Foot Blockchain: “Basically, literally, yes.”“All of this is like a big game of pretend with made-up financial instruments,” he said. “It’s printing your own made-up money. You print your own Monopoly money and then people buy it from you for real money.”The best thing you could possibly say about memecoins is that they initially felt like a funny, countercultural way to participate in internet culture. They satirised a financial system that increasingly looked like a silly game to those on the outside. They encapsulated a humorous generational nihilism.All crypto is bullshit, but memecoins are consciously bullshitAccording to Sander Lutz, the nation’s first crypto-focused White House correspondent: “You could consider a memecoin to be a stock in a cultural phenomenon – like Dogecoin and the Doge meme.”“Another way of defining a memecoin,” Lutz said, “is a cryptocurrency token that has an acknowledged inherent lack of value. The crypto world, outside of memecoins, is full of so many people who are trying to pitch you on tokens that are ‘actually really profound’ or ‘represent a stake’ in some kind of ‘useful network’, but are equally worthless. What makes memecoins different is that there’s none of that noise.”In other words, all crypto is bullshit, but memecoins are consciously bullshit.In their essence, memecoins distill the attention economy into a tradable asset, monetising the ebb and flow of viral internet hype. This has created a system in which the biggest attention-seekers on the planet – Logan Paul, Andrew Tate,Elon Musk,Donald Trump– can bleed their followers for profit. The more controversial they are, the more viral they are; and the more viral they are, the more their memecoins increase in value. Last year, some developers performed attention-seeking stunts on livestreams to pump their tokens, leading toanimal abuse and a faked suicide.Chase Herro, the co-founder of Trump’s main crypto venture, World Liberty Financial, said about crypto: “You can literally sell shit in a can, wrapped in piss, covered in human skin, for a billion dollars if the story’s right, because people will buy it.”Most memecoins end up making money for the person who makes them as a “rug pull” or a “pump and dump”. The term “rug pull” was actually invented by the crypto community, and it works like this:First, you mint a memecoin, and make sure that you and your mates own most of the liquidity pool (the total number of coins in circulation). The size of the liquidity pool – the amount of that memecoin that “exists” – is, like everything else in memecoins, a totally made-up number.Second, you generate hype around the coin by convincing people it will “moon” (shoot up in value). This usually involves getting a celebrity, influencer or the president of the US, to promote it. People then buy the coin, thinking it will be a good investment. Law of demand means that as people buy it, the “value” of the coin goes up, and since you and your mates own the lion’s share, you get richer.The only way you get money is by other people losing moneyDavid GerardThen, at a time known only to you, the creator of the coin, and other insiders, you “pull the rug”, selling off all your stock at the newly high price. You make money, and the value of the coins bought by the masses you manipulated shoots back down to zero. It’s basically a way to just trick people into giving you money, dressed up as an “investment”.A “pump and dump” is pretty much the same thing, but with the slight caveat that you’re doing it with a coin that already exists, rather than creating your own. You buy a cheap coin, “pump” its value by hyping it so others invest, then “dump” all your stock, selling it off at a huge profit and causing everyone else to lose their money.“It’s provably negative sum,” Gerard told me. “The only way you get money is by other people losing money.”The only people really getting rich off memecoins are influencers and their crypto enablers (people like Herro, or Hayden Davis, the guy who helped launch Argentinian president Javier Milei’s memecoin and was involved in Melania Trump’s memecoin).View image in fullscreenDogecoin, the best-known memecoin. The only people getting rich off such crypto are influencers and their enablers.Photograph: Dado Ruvić/ReutersDespite this, the idea that trading memecoins is a good way to get rich persists on the internet. Is it theoretically possible for someone like you or me to invest at just the right time and get rich off a coin?Just as with traditional gambling, there are a tiny number of success stories, such as people like the “Moo Deng whale”, who turned$800of Moo Deng coin (a memecoin referencing theviral pygmy hippoof the same name), into $10m.But only 0.4% ofPump.fun (the main memecoin trading platform)traders have made more than $10,000. About 0.002% have made more than $1m.Lutz told me: “There are a select number of people who’ve made quite a lot of money on these tokens, but they tend to be the same people. They tend to be people who are very well-connected, who are in specific group chats, and who have a lot of existing capital.”“You’ll always have more people losing than amounts of winners,” according to Gerard. “And the winners never shut up, so you think it’s a winning environment.”One of the main reasons people keep falling for these coins is that they think they’ve figured out the scam and invested early, before the rug pull or the dump. But this is never really the case.According to Gerard: “Crypto has been an ever-escalating series of get-rich-quick schemes, where a whole bunch of people think that they’re smarter operators than the previous operator, and generally they’re not.”Memecoin traders will often be invited to Discord and Telegram chats that are sold as “insider channels” where, according to Gerard, “they think they’ll hear about these scams before the rug is pulled – but actually they’re the suckers. Crypto is full of people who think they’re the scammer, not the sucker.”Young gullible menDespite all this, many people – especially young men – continue to invest in memecoins.Forty-two percent of men and 17% of women aged 18 to 29 have invested in, traded or used crypto, according to a 2024Pew Research Center study, compared to only 11% of men and 5% of women over 50.“It’s no accident that memecoins are such a phenomenon among young people who have grown immensely frustrated with a financial system that, I think it’s fair to say, has failed them,” Lutz explained, “and where supposedly sure investments aren’t likely to give them returns that would give them the quality of life their parents had. Memecoins are nakedly meaningless, but there are many financial products, both in crypto and in the world of traditional finance, that may profess to have meaning, but at their core may be nearly as meaningless to young people.”This, too, is why memecoins have become popular with far-right,manosphereinfluencers and their fans.There’s no existing infrastructure to aid people who lose all of their savings on memecoinsSander Lutz“It’s undeniable,” Lutz said, “that the trend in memecoin popularity among younger people – in particular young men – is part of the same trend where you’re seeing a loss of trust in institutions and a loss of confidence that traditional paths to success work out.”“These are the same tenets that have brought young men into the fold of the Maga-verse or to influencers likeAndrew Tate. There’s overlap between them because they both stem from the same frustrations affecting so many young people, in particular young men, who feel more anger, bitterness, disillusionment and nihilism than a generation ago.”Some people don’t even seem to care that they’re being scammed, according to Lutz. “It’s remarkable to see the culture in these ecosystems, because someone will rug-pull a project – what you would consider to be a scam in that they’re running you out of the money – but that’s kind of an accepted practice and people are like: ‘Hey, good for them, I got screwed over, on to the next one.’”“There are too many cases to count of people who’ve lost their entire savings gambling on new coins. If you’re a gambler at a casino, there’s Gamblers Anonymous and an existing infrastructure to deal with people who are addicted to gambling. At casinos you have ‘no play’ lists in compliance with existing laws. There’s no existing infrastructure to aid people who lose all of their savings on memecoins.”Some memecoins try to claim that they’re more than just high-stakes gambling, in order to ensnare more willing buyers. These coins are often accompanied by the false promise of some kind of utility, be it “roadmaps”, “airdrops” ( free tokens given out for marketing purposes), off-chain value mechanisms, games where you can “spend” the coins, and various incomprehensible frameworks using the coin to vote or create some sort of ecosystem. The utility almost never materialises. $Batman coin promised to integrate “entertainment, gaming, and real-world utility”. Paul’s $ZooToken supposedly allowed buyers to play a Pokemon-like gamethat never worked.The exception, the one memecoin to offer a tangible benefit in the real world, is the one sold by the president.President MemeOn 17 January, three days before his second inauguration, Trump launched his own memecoin, $Trump. At the time of writing, the coin’s market cap is over $2.5bn, spurred on by Trump offering a dinner and White House tour to the top owners of the coin, which took place last weekend.Unlike other memecoins, it offered something concrete: access to the president. This made its value soar.View image in fullscreenA protest at Trump National golf club in Sterling, Virginia.Photograph: Rod Lamkey/APRight now, only 20% of the token’s total “supply” is currently in circulation. The remaining 80% is supposedly held by Trump and his business partners.Trump and his business partners are supposedly only allowed to sell off their holdings in $Trump when they are “unlocked” in tranches over time, according to their own made-up rules. As Gerard puts it: “They own the fake money, but they can’t sell it until it’s unlocked in tranches. Note that the limits are artificial. I mean, they could just ‘print’ more.”But already, “58 wallets have made over $10m each from President Donald Trump’s meme coin, totaling $1.1bn in profits”, while “764,000 wallets of mostly small holders have lost money on $TRUMP”, according toCNBC.Gerard said: “A lot of his own fans bought the coin. They thought it would be a fabulous success because Trump is a ‘business genius’. He ripped off his own fans.“The coins’ creators and original sponsors get free $Trump coins and they can dump those on the market at will every time a tranche is released. And they do. And are people ever going to make money on those $Trump coins they bought? Probably not. The money goes to the Trump family, and that’s the direction it was created to make it go in. So yeah, it’s a memecoin dump. He’s just dumping the coins on the suckers and it’s a textbook case.”Trump and his business partners also profit in transaction fees every time $Trump is traded,so far earning $100m.Whether this is all legal or not is up for debate, but soon after launching his own memecoin, Trump replaced the head of the regulator responsible for memecoins, the SEC, with a pro-crypto appointee.It is absolutely the government’s job to stop mis-selling of investmentsDavid GerardLutz said: “In the last few months, the SEC has either dismissed or withdrawn all of its crypto-related lawsuits against every big crypto company in the United States and closed all of its investigations. I mean, the SEC is hosting roundtables almost every week with crypto companies, asking how it can be more helpful to the industry.”Trump has also enthusiastically supported a legal framework for stablecoins. Stablecoins are theoretically stabilised in value by being “pegged” to the value of another asset like the US dollar, but in reality have often become “de-pegged” and therefore unstable.Right now, the Stable Bill and the Genius Bill, which reference Trump calling himself a “stable genius” in 2018, are trying to make their way through Congress. They pave the way for the US government to use stablecoins to pay everything fromhousing grants to social security payments. And Trump himself just so happens to have a stablecoin of his own – through the World Liberty Financial company – which would shoot up in value if these bills pass, earning his family trust potential billions.The Trump family has a claim on 75% of net revenues from World Liberty’s token sales.“It is absolutely the government’s job to stop mis-selling of investments – that’s why ordinary retail mums and dads cannot buy into binary options,” Gerard said. “It’s absolutely open slather for crypto in the US now. This is really bad. A lot of people are going to get skinned. It’s going to be terrible.”The advice? Stay awayIs there any cause for hope? According to Gerard, while it may appear everyone is investing in memecoins, this is mainly exaggerated by the media. Sure, lots of young people have dabbled, but only the real crypto geeks are actually buying the things.From Dogecoin to $Trump: everything you need know about the wild world of meme coinsRead more“The good news is most people are not falling for it. And our evidence for this is the retail dollar trading volumes at Coinbase, the largest crypto dollar exchange. Coinbase happens to be a public company so that means they have to give accurate numbers to the SEC. So they disclosed their retail trading volumes. They’re down 17% in the first quarter of 2025 from where they were in December 2024. They’ve gone down with the Trump coin regime. That gives hope.”As far as my own memecoins go, even the Tate fans who invested appear to have become aware of the scam they fell for.Shortly after the stream went dead, I received an email from a Tate follower titled: “MATT SHAE WE NEED YOUR HELP.” He, along with other Tate fans, claimed they were victims of Tate rug-pulling them. They wanted me to help spread awareness of their community’s plight – by publicizing a new memecoin they had minted called $RRT (Real Rugger Tate).I didn’t write back.Explore more on these topicsCryptocurrenciesDonald TrumpTrump administrationUS politicsAndrew TatefeaturesShareReuse this content"

For decades the LA-based investment fund had specialised in picking up what is known in the trade as distressed assets, a strategy it described as looking for “good companies with bad balance sheets”.So let’s say your company is screwed. You’re deep in debt, severely short of cash, perhaps even at risk of bankruptcy or default. In sweep Oaktree. They have a mosey around, shake down some creditors, restructure your cost base, perhaps offer you a high‑interest loan to stop the bleeding. Once they’ve got you battle-lean they find you a buyer, you sell up, and they take a fat cut. Four years ago, as they cast an eye over the Covid-emaciated carcass of Inter, this was exactly the strategy they had in mind.Qatar bid to complete football with PSG project’s crowd-pleasing third act | Barney RonayRead moreOaktree never intended to own Inter. Their objective was to sustain the ownership of Chinese conglomerate Suning for as long it took to help them sell up, and then cash in. But as the debts accumulated and successive restructurings failed, potential buyers took flight. When Suning defaulted on a debt repayment last May, Oaktreetook over the club pretty much by default. And over the course of 12 months you might say what began as a distressed debt has unexpectedly turned into an opportunistic credit.Saturday evening’s Champions League final is a jarring and stirring clash of styles in so many ways. The relentless attack of Paris Saint-Germain and the relentless defence of Inter. One team built on thefreehand wizardry of youthand one built on theweathered edifice of experience. Flying wingers against flying wing-backs, two strikers against none. But perhaps the biggest philosophical difference is between two radically different models of a football club itself: who it serves, what it can be, what constitutes success, and how to get there.At which point we feel duty-bound to point out just how thrilling and charismatic this young PSG team are, how humble and local, how refreshingly unlike their predecessors. But of course this is still a team assembled at eyewatering expense. Désiré Doué, that lovable homegrown winger: yeah, he cost £45m. Bradley Barcola, he was £40m. Then there was the £60m casually dropped onKhvicha Kvaratskhelia in the January window, an unimaginable expense for most Champions League sides, let alone PSG’s domestic rivals.View image in fullscreenDesiré Doué cost PSG £45m.Photograph: Franco Arland/Getty ImagesObviously this has always been the calculation in Paris: that immense wealth, plus royalty, multiplied by immaculate PR, equals effortless class. Move quickly, break things, make new things. In a way, the pivot-to-likable is simply another example of Parisian/Qatari soft power, the ability to reshape a narrative, another perfectly executed branding exercise by a state where women can still lose their right to financial support if they refuse to have sex with their husband “without a legitimate reason”.And of course PSG can afford all this, can bin off failing players, can wear the big losses, because their mission is far bigger than oneChampions League, one Deloitte money list, bigger even than football. In a way Qatari investment has been the ultimate 4D chess game: a complex apparatus of sportswashing and political favour and designer leisurewear, erected over more than a decade and whose success can only ever partly be measured by Marquinhos’s ability to head away corners.The American investor model, by contrast, measures value in much starker terms. Here the profligacy of PSG is met by the distressed austerity of Inter, an empire not so much being built as nibbled away. Prized assets like Achraf Hakimi and André Onana must be sold to make way for older, budget replacements. Of course there can be no long-term vision here with your ageing squad and council-owned stadium and depressed commercial value. Qatar Airways pay PSG £60m a year for shirt sponsorship; last year a similar offer to Inter was worth around a quarter of that.Howard Marks, the co-founder of Oaktree, often explains investing strategies using sporting analogies. “If we avoid the losers, the winners will take care of themselves,” goes one of his maxims. As a result of their improbable, hugely impressive run to the Champions League final, Inter have already swollen in value: over £1bn, according to some estimates. They are no longer a financial shambles. Whatever happens from here, Oaktree’s initial investment has paid off handsomely.View image in fullscreenSimone Inzaghi has worked with a limited budget at Inter.Photograph: James Gill/Danehouse/Getty ImagesSo, while fans scream for investment in the squad, a new stadium, a transfer war chest to keep Simone Inzaghi at the club, for the dispassionate investor the temptation to sit on this gently appreciating asset, to wait it out, must be immense. No Champions League, noscudetto, no problem: just a secure annual yield, pure viability, pure opportunistic credit.Inter probably go into this game as the favoured choice of most neutrals and purists. But on a sporting level, is either of these models really more romantic than the other? Not really. In the same way that Ousmane Dembélé and Warren Zaïre-Emery are not consciously playing for a state investment fund, Oaktree are not really doing it for the Curva Nord, for the ghosts of Herrera and Facchetti, for the hallowed reputation of Italian football.Until clubs are genuinely owned by their people, these are the sorts of compromises we will continue to endure. A vehicle for geopolitics against a vehicle for pure profit; vulture despotism against cold vulture capitalism. As it ever was in modern football: choose your fighter.Explore more on these topicsChampions LeagueInternazionaleParis Saint-GermaincommentShareReuse this content"

The12-page suit, obtained by the Guardian, lays out allegations of sexual battery, stalking, false imprisonment and physical assault spanning multiple states, including California, Louisiana, Texas and Oregon.The plaintiff claims she began dating Williamson in 2018, when he was a freshman at Duke University, and that the relationship soon turned violent. “Defendant engaged in a continuing pattern of abusive, controlling, and threatening behavior toward Plaintiff,” the complaint states. “The abuse was sexual, physical, emotional, and financial in nature.”According to the suit, the first alleged rape occurred on or about 23 September 2020, when Williamson allegedly had the plaintiff brought to his Beverly Hills home by one of his agents. When he arrived later that evening, she told him she was tired and wanted to go to sleep. “Defendant called Plaintiff ‘stuck up’ and a ‘bitch’ and told her that she could not go to sleep without having sex with him,” the complaint alleges. “Plaintiff told Defendant ‘no.’ Defendant pinned Plaintiff down on the bed with her hands behind her back and raped her.” The filing claims he later threw her phone across the room and choked her while yelling.A second alleged incident occurred two weeks later, on 10 October 2020, when the plaintiff expressed interest in seeing a friend in San Diego. The complaint alleges Williamson became enraged, threw objects in the home, then assaulted her before raping her again. “Defendant took Plaintiff’s cellphone and laptop and kept them for a period of time so that Plaintiff could not contact anyone to secure a ride elsewhere, report the assault, or seek medical care,” the suit says.The filing also outlines a broader pattern of alleged violence and coercive control that continued through 2023. It accuses Williamson of physically beating the plaintiff, entering her home without consent, threatening to distribute nude images of her and monitoring her movements. “Defendant threatened to have his paid security guard shoot Plaintiff in the head while the security guard was present and carrying a loaded firearm,” the complaint reads. “Defendant threatened to have his paid security guard kill Plaintiff’s parents, after informing Plaintiff that he knows their home address.”In one instance in 2022, the suit claims Williamson forced the plaintiff into a vehicle and slammed the car door on her head when she tried to escape, causing her to lose consciousness. On multiple occasions, she alleges, he strangled or suffocated her until she passed out. Many of these episodes, the complaint adds, occurred when Williamson was allegedly intoxicated or under the influence of cocaine.“These acts occurred without Plaintiff’s consent and against her will,” the lawsuit alleges, detailing 18 separate forms of violence and control. The plaintiff says she has suffered lasting trauma, including anxiety, depression, insomnia and physical injury, and has incurred costs for medical and psychological treatment. The complaint seeks general, special and punitive damages and demands a jury trial.Williamson, a two-timeNBAAll-Star and the No 1 overall pick in the 2019 NBA draft, has denied the allegations through his attorney, Michael Balascio. “We take these allegations with the utmost seriousness, and we unequivocally deny them,” Balascio said in a statement. “The allegations contained in the complaint are categorically false and reckless.”Balascio described the plaintiff as a former acquaintance and claimed the two shared a “consensual, casual relationship that began more than six years ago,” when Williamson was 18. “At no point during or immediately after that relationship did the plaintiff raise any concerns,” he said. “Only after the friendship ended did she begin demanding millions of dollars.”Williamson’s legal team claims he has filed a police report accusing the plaintiff of extortion and that an arrest warrant has been issued. He intends to file a counterclaim and “seek significant damages for this defamatory lawsuit”, Balascio said.The plaintiff is represented by the Lanier Law Firm, a nationally known trial firm based in Texas and California. Her attorney, Sam Taylor II, said the case is being handled carefully given its seriousness. “It’s not her desire or our desire to litigate this case in the press,” Taylor told the New York Post. “Our client looks forward to her day in court where she can go and explain to a jury what happened to her, the things she endured for this defendant, and getting justice.”A spokesperson for the Pelicans said the team is aware of the matter but is deferring all comment to Williamson’s legal representatives. No criminal charges have been filed and the suit currently proceeds solely as a civil matter.Williamson has played in just 214 games over five seasons with the Pelicans due to a rash of injuries, including missing the entire 2021–22 season. Still, he remains a high-profile face of the franchise and one of the league’s most visible young stars, with career averages of 24.7 points, 6.6 rebounds and 4.3 assists.Whether the case proceeds to trial or is resolved through other legal avenues, both parties appear ready to contest the facts in court. “Mr Williamson will not be intimidated into a settlement based on lies,” Balascio said. “He will defend his reputation vigorously.”Explore more on these topicsNew Orleans PelicansNBABasketballUS sportsRape and sexual assaultShareReuse this content"

It will surely be full to capacity given about 40,000Nerazzurriare expected to arrive in time for Saturday’s Champions League final, even if under half that number will officially make it into Allianz Arena for the match itself. This is not only an appointment with history for their opponents, Paris Saint-Germain; Inter have blended silk with street-fighting qualities to stand on the verge of theirfirst European title since 2010.Gianni Infantino is unlikely to be among the melee but theFifapresident’s sympathies are well documented. He will be quietly rooting for Inter from the VIP seats and perhaps it will be an opportune moment for some bridge building. There is a constituency of Inter fans in Uefa’s higher echelons, after all, and football’s biggest governing bodies could certainly do with discovering a few acres of common ground.Delegates walk out of Fifa congress after Infantino arrives late from Trump tripRead moreSurface temperatures have, at least, cooled since a number of European delegates at the Fifa congress walked out this month in protest at Infantino’s prioritising of meetings in the Middle East. A conciliatory public statement fromUefasaw to that, although nobody should assume all is forgiven behind the scenes. There is little love lost between their respective leaderships and the summer ahead is only likely to intensify the power struggle for the future of the elite game.It means that, from Uefa’s perspective, there is every incentive to pull off a bravura spectacle on Saturday night. The revamped Club World Cup, Infantino’sdeeply controversial pet project, begins in a fortnight and a statement of who runs the biggest show in town would be timely. Inter and PSG could face each other again in that competition’s final; they are on opposite sides of the draw and it is hardly an impossible scenario if enough can be wrung from their overstretched players. But a show for the ages in Munich would be a hard act to follow, and demonstrate that the traditional gongs, albeit in their heavily updated form, still hold the greatest weight.Greeting visitors to the coffee lounge at Hotel Bayerischer Hof, handed over to Uefa and their wide-ranging entourage for the weekend, are mannequins clothed in replica shirts bearing the names of Lautaro Martínez and Marquinhos. Perhaps that inadvertently speaks of an obvious inconvenience in this final’s grapple for eyeballs: the lack of a global superstar to reel in casual enthusiasts. That should not spoil the game itself, which will be finely poised between a free-flowing PSG and an Inter side that can deliver knockout blows at a stroke. It is hard to escape the thought, though, that the commercial brains in Nyon would have deemed Lamine Yamal’s presence more future-facing.View image in fullscreenAn Inter fan wears a hat with a cutout of Lautaro Martínez’s head in Munich.Photograph: Angelika Warmuth/ReutersHow much the presence of Linkin Park at the now obligatory pre-match show will enthral younger fans is a different question, albeit not an altogether separate matter. The influential European Club Association (ECA) chair Nasser al-Khelaifi, who also happens to run PSG, has never been shy to say he wants these occasions to rival a Super Bowl in tone and glamour. Given the ECA’s ever-growing power, it would not hurt Uefa to deliver one. Fifa will certainly try to do that when the Club World Cup concludes in New Jersey on 13 July.Khelaifi sits astride football’s sparring factions, with sources describing him as modern football’s kingmaker. The ECA leadership have fully backed Infantino’s tournament, to the extent that a handful of staff are working full time on preparations for the event. But their recent joint commercial venture with Uefa, UC3, promises to supercharge the Champions League’s presence and influence across the Atlantic. Which competition will ultimately produce the kind of jamboree Khelaifi envisages?Frattesi fires Inter into final as Barcelona fall short in seven-goal instant classicRead moreUefa is satisfied, at least, that this season’s reformatted Champions League has proved successful. Insiders have sung the praises of its 36-team “league phase” to the point of evangelism, even if its debut edition did not ultimately deliver the level of tension and jeopardy that had been threatened. This weekend is seen an opportune moment to discuss feedback given by participating clubs. Small tweaks may follow, but there will be no fundamental changes to the structure. One alteration that may come closer to fruition in Munich would see the clubs that finished higher in the league phase given the perceived advantage of a home second leg in the knockout stage in an attempt to incentivise performance in that sprawling first round.Next season asix-strong English contingentwill knock the Champions League’s remaining credibility as a truly representative European tournament, even if it offers an accurate snapshot of the Premier League’s overwhelming strength. Nineteen of the 36 league phase competitors will come from England, Germany, Spain or Italy; a Super League is effectively here by stealth, but few of the gathered stakeholders in Bavaria feel moved to obsess over a lack of diversity.Instead they will savour a radiant weekend in a city that certainly offers a sufficiently highbrow stage. In Königsplatz, PSG’s supporters will gather in their own specially designated area. The location, a stone’s throw from Odeonsplatz, may keep security personnel on their toes. Passing through the Bayerischer Hof lobby, Khelaifi laughed off any suggestion nerves may consume him on Saturday.The final looks too close to call. Maybe Infantino, along with a number of his peers from Uefa, will depart with the glow of a champion, but the powerbrokers’ grievances are unlikely to melt entirely in the Bavarian sun.Explore more on these topicsChampions LeagueUefaFifaFootball politicscommentShareReuse this content"

The letter stated that in the event of a challenge by the federation or by World Boxing to Khelif’s sex certification, Khelif would remain ineligible to compete until the dispute was resolved.Speaking to ITV News in March about the row over her involvement at the Olympics, Khelif said: “I see myself as a girl, just like any other girl. I was born a girl, raised as a girl and have lived my entire life as one.“I have competed in many tournaments, including the Tokyo Olympics and other major competitions, as well as four world championships. All of these took place before I started winning and earning titles. But once I began achieving success, the campaigns against me started.”All athletes over 18 wishing to compete in a World Boxing owned or sanctioned event will need to undergo a PCR (polymerase chain reaction) genetic test to determine their sex at birth and their eligibility to compete.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The moves came on the day Liverpool agreed to letTrent Alexander-Arnoldjoin Real Madrid early in a deal worth £10m.Men’s transfer window summer 2025: all deals from Europe’s top five leaguesRead moreLiverpool head coach, Arne Slot, considers Wirtz an ideal option to improve his Premier League champions and the club moved quickly to open talks with Leverkusen once the coveted 22-year-old rejected a move to Bayern Munich. Manchester City were also interested in the attacking midfielder but withdrew, seemingly as a result of the financial package involved.The offer for the Germany international is £109m (€130m) including add-ons and eclipses comfortably Liverpool’s transfer record of £85m for Darwin Núñez. Negotiations have progressed swiftly but it remains to be seen whether Leverkusen will sell at that price. The German club valued Wirtz, who can play anywhere across the front line, at £126m (€150m) when Bayern made their approach. Liverpool’s position is strengthened by the fact Wirtz, capped 29 times by Germany, wants to join them and is keen on a fresh challenge abroad after five years in the Bundesliga.Liverpool’s first signing of what is expected to be a busy summer is Frimpong. Liverpool triggered a €35m (£29.5m) release clause in the Netherlands international’s contract that will be paid in three annual instalments. Frimpong can operate at right-back but is not considered a like-for-like replacement for Alexander-Arnold by Liverpool, who also have Conor Bradley and others competing for that role.The 24-year-old’s ability to also play as a wing-back or as an orthodox winger added to the attraction for Liverpool and increases Slot’s tactical options for next season, when Mohamed Salah will be absent for a period due to the Africa Cup of Nations. That tournament is scheduled to take place in Morocco from 21 December to 18 January.View image in fullscreenJeremie Frimpong has completed his move to Liverpool, which will become official on Sunday.Photograph: Nikki Dyer/LFC/Getty Images“It went quite easy,” said Frimpong about his move to Liverpool. “For me, it was like, ‘Whatever you guys do, just get this done’.“Liverpool fans, I’m going to give my all, my energy, my work-rate and hopefully we can win together, we celebrate together, get everything together.”Frimpong, an international teammate of Virgil van Dijk, Ryan Gravenberch and Cody Gakpo, will officially become a Liverpool player when the transfer window opens on Sunday. On the same day Alexander-Arnold’s registration will transfer to Real, who reopened talks with Liverpool this week to sign the defender in time for the Club World Cup, which starts on 14 June.Alexander-Arnold’s Liverpool contract is due to expire on 30 June and the Spanish giants initially proposed an £850,000 deal to sign him early. That was rejected. However, a deal has now been reached whereby Real will pay Liverpool a one-off €10m fee to cancel the right-back’s contract early. They will also cover Alexander-Arnold’s wages for June. That means the total deal is worth £10m to Liverpool.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Go out there and put a graft in,’” said Beever-Jones. “I think her exact words were ‘Destroy them’, in her Dutch accent. For us, it was just executing the gameplan.”Alessia Russo has nailed down the No 9 shirt following the retirement of Ellen White after the Euros in 2022, but a fitting substitute and challenger to her has been missing. Beever-Jones staked her claim in front of 48,531 fans, her hat-trick in a five-goal first-half blitz coming in only her second England start.It was a heartening win for the Lionesses as they focus all eyes on this summer’s Euros in Switzerland. It also secured England second place in Nations League Group A3, two points behind Spain before they go head to head on Tuesday.Wiegman’s England ship, so used to sailing under clear skies, hit choppier water this week, the retirement announcement of Euro 2022 winner Mary Earps, just 39 days out from the team beginning their title defence, sending shockwaves through St George’s Park.View image in fullscreenChloe Kelly came on as a substitute in the second half and scored within four minutes, heading home Beth Mead’s pinpoint cross.Photograph: Shaun Botterill/Getty ImagesWiegman implied in April that Hannah Hampton had leapfrogged Earps in the pecking order, when she described the Chelsea goalkeeper as being “a little bit ahead”. It was hoped that Earps would act as the elder stateswoman of a group of young keepers and provide substantial backup to Hampton, with Anna Moorhouse and Khiara Keating currently uncapped.Earps’ exit is undoubtedly a blow, as was the absence of Millie Bright, unavailable through choice for being “mentally and physically at my limits”. However, nothing buries bad news as well as good news and such an emphatic win over Portugal, with a starting XI looking a little different from how it will shape up in Switzerland, certainly helps.It took just three minutes for Beever-Jones to put the home team ahead, pouncing on a loose ball after good pressure from Jess Park before putting it coolly beyond goalkeeper Inês Pereira. Two minutes later and England had their second. Jess Carter, fresh from a Concacaf Champions Cup win with Gotham FC, won the ball and it was worked to Mead. Her shot was blocked but the ball fell to Lucy Bronze, who headed into an empty net.In her first Wembley start, Beever-Jones’ second goal arrived with a header from a Bronze cross. Mead joined the party for England’s fourth, Park shrugging off Dolores Silva before releasing her to nutmeg Catarina Amado and fire in.Beever-Jones’s hat-trick was completed in the 33rd minute, making her the second England women’s player to score a Wembley treble after Mead. A long ball from Leah Williamson, one of five of Arsenal’s Champions League winners in the squad, alongside Mead, Lotte Wubben-Moy, Russo and Chloe Kelly, found the forward, who took a couple of touches before firing in low at the near post.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

She is really tight on the ball. The team did well coming into positions so the connections were really good. She played really relaxed.”It would be easy, and a little lazy, to describe Portugal, ranked 22nd in the world, as pushovers. They were poor defensively but this is a team who have been a small thorn in the side of Wiegman’s England. The Lionesses were held to a 1-1 draw in the reverse fixture in February and a 0-0 draw in a friendly on the eve of the World Cup in July 2023. In fact, England’s last victory against them came towards the end of Phil Neville’s tenure, a sloppy 1-0 win amid a sea of draws and defeats in October 2019.England calmed down a little in the second half, but three changes around the hour re-energised the players, who have clawed their way to the end of a long season only to be straight back in with their national team. Substitute Kelly added the team’s sixth, heading in Mead’s cross.There were no more goals but it was an emphatic and entertaining performance, the off-pitch drama comfortably excluded to leave England focused on preparing for the Euros.Explore more on these topicsWomen's Nations LeagueEngland women's football teamPortugal women’s football teamWomen's footballmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

United’s stance remains that Fernandes is not for sale and Amorim doubled down on that position after watching his team beat Hong Kong 3-1 in a post-season friendly on Friday. He views his countryman as vital to the club’s future. The 30-year-old was named United’s player of the season for a record-equalling fourth time. He is contracted to the clubuntil June 2027.Asked if the win over Hong Kong may prove to be Fernandes’ final appearance for United, Amorim said: “I don’t think so. I don’t know for sure, nobody knows, but I don’t think so. I think he’s seeing us taking some actions to change things and that’s all he asks.Football Daily | Fear and loathing in Kuala Lumpur: Manchester United’s tour is going wellRead more“I think he wants to stay. He is saying no to a lot of things, but that shows he wants to win. He’s really young, he’s really good, he needs to be in the best league in the world.”Amorim denied United would be forced to cash in on Fernandes in order to generate transfer funds. The club’s failure to qualify for the Champions League after a catastrophic campaign means finances will be tight this summer, with United needing to sell several players before they can buy. “We can find another way to earn money,” Amorim said. Alejandro Garnacho, who started alongside Fernandes in Hong Kong, could well be sold, while Marcus Rashford, Antony and Jadon Sancho – all of whom spent time away from Old Trafford on loan this season – are for sale.Afterlosing 1-0 to Asean All-Stars in their first post-season friendlyin Malaysia, United again fell behind in Hong Kong. But after Juninho’s 19th-minute opener for the hosts, young striker Chido Obi scored twice after replacing Rasmus Højlund for the second half.Obi’s first was a smart left-footed finish after he turned under pressure in the box following Manuel Ugarte’s tackle. The 17-year-old then glanced Mason Mount’s cross into the net to snatch the lead eight minutes from time. Fellow former Arsenal youngster Ayden Heaven completed the victory in added time when he met Amad Diallo’s ball with a powerful header. The goals were Obi and Heaven’s first senior strikes for United, albeit not in a competitive fixture.United are not in action again until 19 July when they take on Leeds in Stockholm, before a pre-season tour of the US where they will play West Ham, Bournemouth and Everton. Fernandes is expected to feature for Portugal in the Nations League semi-finals against Germany on 4 June. The final and third-place playoff are set for 8 June.Explore more on these topicsManchester UnitedRuben AmorimTransfer windownewsShareReuse this content"

Andrew ­Cavenagh becomes the new chair at Ibrox, with Paraag Marathe, the president of 49ers Enterprises and chair of Leeds, the vice-chair. The Scottish Football Association has approved the takeover, with the club keen to stress they are not part of a multi-club model.49ers Enterprises is the investment arm of the San Francisco 49ers NFL team. An extraordinary general meeting in late June will approve plans for a new share issue, through which the US-based group will invest £20m into Rangers. That is primarily earmarked for transfer dealings as they seek to wrest control of Scottish football back from their city rivals Celtic.Funds so far have been spent securing shares, including from previous chairs Dave King and John Bennett. Mark Taber, Andrew Clayton and Gene Schneur will join the Rangers board. Patrick Stewart, the chief executive, Fraser Thornton, John Halsted and George Taylor will remain as directors but Graeme Park, Julian Wolhardt and Alastair Johnston are stepping down.“The consortium will chart a new strategic vision for the club’s future prioritising on-pitch performance and long-term financial sustainability,” read a Rangers statement. As part of this process, the club are expected to move from an unlisted public limited company to a private one.Marathe said: “At 49ers Enterprises, we have built a track record of sporting and business success, but our driving motivation is our deep connection to the clubs and communities we serve. We are excited to join Andrew and our other consortium of investors in a new era for this iconic club, and wWe are determined to build something that supporters can be proud of for years to come.”Rangers remain in the market for a new manager after thesacking of Philippe Clementin February. ­Gretar Steinsson, who holds a key role within 49ers Enterprises, has been heavily involved in the recruitment process.Davide Ancelotti, son of Carlo, appears to be in pole position to succeed Clement but has been pushing for a swift decision from Rangers amid supposed interest from other clubs. Former Southampton manager Russell Martin, Francesco Farioli, who left Ajax this month, and Brian Priske, who was sacked by Feyenoord in February, are also known to have held talks with Steinsson.With Kevin Thelwell to formally start his job as sporting director of Rangers on Monday, a new manager is likely to be confirmed next week.Explore more on these topicsRangersScottish PremiershipnewsShareReuse this content"

The youngest alleged victims are aged 11 and 17.Two charges, wounding and attempted grievous bodily harm, relate to one of the young people. None of the six can be named due to reporting restrictions.Wearing a black suit and grey tie, Doyle spoke only to confirm his name, address and date of birth during the short magistrates court hearing. He looked emotional as he was brought into the packed courtroom, glancing briefly at the dozens of reporters before fixing his gaze to the floor.Astbury said it was alleged that Doyle “used his vehicle as a weapon to injure”. Richard Derby, defending, said there was no indication of his pleas to the charges at this stage.After a 12-minute hearing, Doyle was remanded in custody and told by the district judge, Paul Healey, that he would appear at Liverpool crown court later the same day.Astbury argued Doyle should be refused bail as there was a “real risk to his safety” if he were allowed to leave court. The prosecutor said the defendant “appeared to be a man of some means”, meaning there was a “substantial risk of failing to attend court”.Healey, the district judge, described the case as “truly exceptional” as he imposed reporting restrictions preventing the identification of the six victims. He said the defendant was alleged to have caused “very extensive injuries” and there was a “very real prospect of further charges”.Later on Friday, in a brief hearing at Liverpool crown court before Judge Menary KC, Astbury said: “This is very much an ongoing investigation and there are many witnesses still be interviewed and a great deal of CCTV still to be analysed and, of course, medical evidence to be secured.”Doyle nodded as he was told by Menary that he would be remanded in custody “given the nature of the public interest in this case and the legitimate concerns that others have about your welfare if in the community”. He was told he would next appear at Liverpool crown court on 14 August before a provisional trial date on 24 November.Doyle’s LinkedIn profile says he was a Royal Marine commando between 1990 and 1994 before working in IT and cybersecurity. The university graduate is said to have worked previously for an NHS trust and a large UK wealth management firm.View image in fullscreenA vehicle believed to contain Paul Doyle drives into court on Friday.Photograph: Phil Noble/ReutersThe Crown Prosecution Service said on Thursday it would keep the charges under review “as the investigation progresses”.The assistant chief constable Jenny Sims, of Merseyside police, said the force was “determined to gather as much evidence as possible” and that detectives were analysing volumes of CCTV footage, dashcam material and police body-worn video.Sims said: “I fully understand how this incident has left us all shocked and saddened, and I know many will continue to have concerns and questions. Our detectives are working tirelessly, with diligence and professionalism, to seek the answers to all those questions. When we are able to, we will provide further information.”She added: “We know Monday’s shocking scenes reverberated around the city of Liverpool, and the entire country, on what should have been a day of celebration for hundreds of thousands of Liverpool FC supporters.

The 18-year-old sustained a knee injury which could put in doubt her participation in this summer’s European Championship.The Welsh did regroup and a moment of controversy occurred midway through the half when Ceri Holland was denied by Maja Bay Østergaard and Fishlock sent an effort towards goal, but Stine Ballisager got back to clear.Replays later appeared to show the ball had crossed the line, but it remained goalless at the break after Amalie Vangsgaard squandered a fine opportunity for Denmark and Harder was twice thwarted in quick succession.It would not take Harder long after half-time to open the scoring, though, as the Danish forward slotted home in the 48th minute.

On Friday afternoon, however, Ostapenko experienced the rare sensation of not being in control as Elena Rybakina put on a devastating exhibition of her effortless, destructive ball-striking to reach the fourth round of theFrench Openwith a 6-2, 6-2 demolition of the former champion.The most notable consequence of Rybakina’s victory, of course, is that she will renew her rivalry with the four-time champion Iga Swiatek in what will be the most highly anticipated match in either singles draw. In the match preceding them on Court Suzanne Lenglen, Swiatek closed out her 24th consecutive victory at the French Open by defeating Jaqueline Cristian 6-2, 7-5.French Open: Rybakina sets up Swiatek clash, Alcaraz to come on day six – liveRead moreA week after winning her first title in over a year in Strasbourg, this victory marks another positive step forward for Rybakina. Much of her past 12 months have been extremely difficult, with the Kazakhstani falling from her career high ranking of No 3 to her current spot at No 11. Not long ago, Rybakina had positioned herself as the top contender to Swiatek and Aryna Sabalenka. In recent months, she has been her own biggest rival.Although Rybakina has been frequently sidelined with various illnesses over the past year, her issues have also been personal. In February, her previous long-time coach, Stefano Vukov, was suspended by the WTA tour for a year after the organisation concluded that Vukov had been verbally abusive to Rybakina, breaching the WTA’s code of conduct. Despite Rybakina objecting to the WTA’s ban, Vukov is banned from attaining accreditation at official WTA events and grand slam tournaments. On Wednesday, Rybakina noted that she continues to work with Vukov on-court between tournaments: “We usually practice together between the tournaments, not when the tournament is on,” she said.It has been eight years since Ostapenko shocked the tennis world by spectacularly winning the 2017 French Open and Rybakina won her first grand slam title at Wimbledon in 2021. A battle between two major champions is always a significant event, but the prospect of a meeting with Swiatek, and their respective records against the four-time French Open champion, only added a level of significance to the tie.View image in fullscreenJelena Ostapenko was hoping to make it through to a match with Iga Swiatek, whom she has beaten six times and never lost to.Photograph: Anne-Christine Poujoulat/AFP/Getty ImagesAt this point, the match-up between Ostapenko and Swiatek is the most notorious non-rivalry on the tour. After defeating Swiatek en route to winning the Stuttgart Open title last month, Ostapenko is now 6-0 versus the Pole having defeated her on every surface. Ostapenko is a supreme ball-striker and, when she finds her rhythm, she times the ball more sweetly than almost any other player. Even so, a player as distinguished as Swiatek having such a difficult match-up issue against a lesser opponent is shocking.Although Swiatek avoided her greatest nemesis, facing Rybakina is hardly a positive outcome. Their head-to-head record is tied at 4-4 and Rybakina’s game matches up well against the Pole, with her powerful first serve neutralising Swiatek’s return of serve and she takes time away with her clean, flat ball-striking. As Swiatek attempts to rebuild her confidence on her favourite court after a difficult few months, this will be an enormous test as she attempts to win four consecutive French Open titles.Elsewhere, the top seed, Aryna Sabalenka, eased into the second week with a comfortable 6-2, 6-3 win over Olga Danilovic of Serbia. Afterwards, Sabalenka said that she was happy for Swiatek to carry the title of favourite, and the pressure that comes with it, in this tournament: “It’s tough to predict in women’s tennis,” she said. “Let’s just leave it on Iga since she won it, what, three times in a row, really, right? I will just leave it for her.”Amélie Mauresmo, the French Open tournament director, defended the tournament’s decision not to schedule women’s matches during the tournament’s night sessions. “For me, the message that I always said, and I will repeat, as I said, the conditions did not change from having one unique match in the evening,” said Mauresmo. “For me, the message is not changing, and it has never been that the girls are not worthy to play at night. It’s never been this. I will not accept that you carry this message. That’s really clear to me.”View image in fullscreenCarlos Alcaraz fought through despite some stellar play from Damir Dzumhur.Photograph: Teresa Suárez/EPALate on Court Philippe-Chatrier, Carlos Alcaraz, the second seed and defending champion, held off a brilliant surge from Damir Dzumhur to reach the fourth round with a tough 6-1, 6-3, 4-6, 6-4 victory.Alcaraz had appeared to be cruising to victory as he established a two-set lead over Dzumhur, a diminutive 33-year-old ranked No 69 in the world. As Alcaraz’s level slightly fell, the Bosnian played stellar tennis to win the third set before leading 3-1 in the fourth. Under real pressure for the first time this year, Alcaraz held his nerve as he reeled off five of the final six games to advance. He will next face Ben Shelton, the 13th seed, on Sunday.Explore more on these topicsFrench Open 2025French OpenTennisnewsShareReuse this content"

It came down to who could hold their nerve best in a dog-fight of a tiebreak.Alexei Popyrin is through to the last 16 for the first time in Paris!#RolandGarrospic.twitter.com/JgfPLfu2aO— Roland-Garros (@rolandgarros)May 30, 2025Borges earned a couple of set points and Popyrin four more, before finally on the sixth attempt to wrap it up after 72 minutes, he profited from the Portuguese finally crashing a backhand long.Popyrin’s relief was palpable and the pressure cranked up on Borges, who found himself having to save two match points at 4-5 before dragging the match into another tiebreak.Popyrin powered into a 6-2 lead in the tiebreak only for Borges to doggedly save three more until the No.25 seed finally delivered one more irretrievable serve to prevail in just a minute over three hours.It sets up an even more difficult date in the fourth round for the 25-year-old against Russian 24th seed Karen Khachanov or American 12th seed Tommy Paul, who were locked in a five-set battle on Court Simonne-Mathieu.Explore more on these topicsTennisFrench OpenAustralia sportnewsShareReuse this content"

Certainly those chasing the dominant McLaren were optimistic that might be the case.The technical regulation was imposed as teams look to push the boundaries of the rules, with a flex in the wing under load affording the maximum downforce in corners. In order to maintain a level playing field, the wings must now pass a deflection test measuring the leeway of their flex. This has been reduced from 15mm to 10mm.Lewis Hamilton labels talk of strained relationship with Ferrari engineer as ‘BS’Read moreSuch is the minutiae that engineers and regulators adore, but where it matters is in racing terms. The adjustment was brought in over concerns thatMcLarenwere exploiting it to their advantage. The FIA decided to impose a reset but the front wing is such an integral part of the car that it allowed until now, the ninth round of the season, to develop the new models.Red Bull have intimated their doubts over McLaren’s wing legality, front and rear. The regulations on the rear wing were tightened for the Chinese Grand Prix and McLaren still emerged on top. Their team principal, Andrea Stella, had been bullish that the changes would have no effect on the strengths of their car and believed it meant their rivals were focused on the wrong things.Then there are teams such asFerrari, who have not exploited the potential advantages as much as other squads and who may hope to make gains by their rivals losing a little. Their team principal, Fred Vasseur, said they had been working “for ages” on what he considered might be a “gamechanger”. There is also the consideration that it may affect tyre degradation, given it is a key part of the airflow over the car. This is an area where McLaren have had their biggest advantage, able to push harder and longer on their tyres, a strength which will be particularly notable on the high temperature and high-speed Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya which puts a heavy load through the rubber.Whether this is the case will not be truly discernible until the race and the teams put in a full stint in the blazing sunshine on a circuit that offers the ideal test bed to ascertain how these changes have panned out.McLaren’sLando Norris, who won at the last round in Monaco and now trails Oscar Piastri, his teammate and the championship leader, by three points, was convinced the changes would have no effect on McLaren and indeed the team had already debuted their new version of the wing in practice at Imola.Lando Norris wins Monaco F1 GP to close gap on championship leader PiastriRead moreCertainly in first practice they appeared to have nonchalantly shrugged off the changes. Norris was once more comfortably quickest, more than three-tenths clear ofMax Verstappenin second with Lewis Hamilton and Charles Leclerc in third and fourth for Ferrari, with Piastri fifth.Verstappen, the defending champion, has already noted he did not expect the changes to make a major difference to the Red Bull and his team principal, Christian Horner, said he believed it was too early to tell if there had been any impact on other teams.“The change is reasonably subtle, but it is reasonably significant,” he said. “Now, whether it’s a net or same effect for each of the teams is difficult to tell. Still early days but the net effect to us has been rather small.”By the end of second practice the pecking order remained very familiar – Piastri more than two-tenths clear of the Mercedes of George Russell, Verstappen third, Norris fourth and Leclerc fifth, suggesting it is very muchplus ça changein Spain and leaving McLaren with a firm hold on the championship.Explore more on these topicsFormula OneMotor sportMcLarenFerrariRed BullMax VerstappenLando NorrisnewsShareReuse this content"

Prodhomme, from the Decathlon AG2R La Mondiale team, broke free on the fourth climb to take the lead and eventually the victory to become the first Frenchman to win a Giro stage this year.Giro d’Italia: Denz surges to stage win as Del Toro keeps hold of pink jerseyRead more“I’ve worked a lot for this Giro d’Italia,” Prodhomme said. “I didn’t want to compete for the GC, I wanted to try and win a stage. I’ve waited for long for this win to come. I won my first race three weeks ago [on the Tour of the Alps] but to win at the Giro d’Italia makes me very happy. It’s a beautiful day.”Prodhomme had attacked with more than seven kilometres left to the summit and he quickly put distance between himself and the stage 15 winner, Carlos Verona, and Antonio Tiberi, while the group with Del Toro was more than a minute behind. As the general classification battle raged behind him, the 28-year-old pushed ahead and on the home stretch, he emerged through a cloud of pink smoke, holding his helmet in disbelief as he crossed the line to win by nearly a minute.“Our breakaway didn’t have a big gap. I didn’t feel great when I followed the first attacks. My legs were stiff on the first climb. Kilometre after kilometre, I felt better on the bike,” Prodhomme said.“On Col de Joux, I realised that I needed to take risks – otherwise we were going nowhere … Before today I’ve had two top-five finishes because I don’t take a lot of risks.

Del Toro’s lead is now 43 seconds over Carapaz, while Yates is 1min 21sec behind in third.“I had the legs to be with Richard … I cannot take more risks but today was incredible,” Del Toro said. “Everyone in our country is starting to see how hard cycling is.

Touch it this year, hopefully we win.”Edmonton scored on its first two shots, and jumped ahead 3-0 in the first 8:07 on way to eliminating the Stars in the West final for the second year in a row.The Oilers get another rematch, against defendingStanley Cupchampion Florida after a seven-game series last June after the Panthers had won the first three games. Game 1 is Wednesday night in Edmonton.Dallas was within a goal when Thomas Harley had a one-timer blocked by Mattias Ekholm, the Oilers defenseman playing for the first time this postseason. McDavid gathered the long ricochet well past center ice, stayed ahead of speedy Roope Hintz and beat goalie Casey DeSmith with 5:32 left in the second period.“That’s a Connor McDavid kind of play and that’s just the player he is,” Perry said.Mattias Janmark, Jeff Skinner, Evander Kane and Kasperi Kapanen also scored for Edmonton, the last an empty-netter in the closing seconds. Leon Draisaitl and Jake Walman each had two assists.Jason Robertson scored twice and Hintz had a goal for the Stars, who ended their season in the West final for the third year in a row. Wyatt Johnston and Harley each had two assists.“You’ve got to keep knocking on the door,” Stars coach Pete DeBoer said. “We chased every single game in this series and that’s a tough way to play hockey against that team. It was the story of the entire series, but the fourth goal, Connor’s goal ... puck bounces into the neutral zone, he’s coming off the bench, he’s not missing that. It’s game over.”DeSmith had taken over in net after starting goalie Jake Oettinger was pulled following Janmark’s goal that made it 2-0 only 7:09 into the game.Edmonton goalie Stuart Skinner had 14 saves. DeSmith, who hadn’t played since April 26 in Game 1 of the first round against Colorado, stopped 17 of 20 shots.Perry scored on a power play, assisted by McDavid and Draisaitl, only 2:31 in the game. His seven goals are the most by any player age 39 or older in a single postseason, and the 2007 Stanley Cup champion with Anaheim when he was 22 is now going to his fifth final in the past six seasons.That was McDavid’s 100th assist in 90 playoff games, the second-fastest player inNHLhistory to reach that mark. Wayne Gretzky had 100 assists in his first 70 playoff games, and no other player has reached the mark in fewer than 125 games.Robertson scored a minute into the third period to get the Stars within a goal again. Kane then scored on a shot that went off the skate of Dallas defenseman Esa Lindell and past DeSmith.Jeff Skinner, the 33-year-old forward who has played 1,078 regular-season games over 15 years with three teams, scored his first career postseason goal for the 3-0 lead. His playoff debut was in the first-round opener against Los Angeles on April 21, but he didn’t play again until Thursday when the Oilers were without injured forwards Zach Hyman and Connor Brown.Explore more on these topicsNHLStanley CupEdmonton OilersDallas StarsFlorida PanthersUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

On Thursday night, they got a firestorm. With their season dangling by a thread, theNew York Knicksdelivered a wire-to-wire 111–94 beatdown of the Indiana Pacers in Game 5 of the Eastern Conference finals, keeping their playoff hopes alive and forcing a Game 6 in Indianapolis on Saturday.Jalen Brunson scored 32 points and Karl-Anthony Towns added 24 points and 13 rebounds – despite a bruised left knee that had left his status uncertain until shortly before tipoff – as the Knicks trimmed the Pacers’ lead to 3–2 in the best-of-seven-games series and gave their home fans something to believe in.Anthony Edwards is 23, far from a failure – and not the next LeBron just yetRead more“It was do or die,” Towns said. “Nothing was going to stop me from playing this game.”Brunson, held in check during a blowout loss in Game 4, bounced back in familiar fashion. He dropped 14 points in the first quarter alone, finishing 12-of-18 from the field and adding four assists in his 21st career playoff game with 30 or more points, extending a Knicks franchise record he set last week.“We were just able to get stops early and we would convert,” Brunson said. “We just found a way.”New York never trailed, flipping the script after a week of frustration that had included two home losses, oneunprecedented collapseand a series deficit that left them staring down elimination. But the Game 5 version of the Knicks looked far more like the team that had been among the class of the East all year: tough, urgent, together.The defense set the tone early. After surrendering 43 points in the first quarter of Game 4, the Knicks gave up just 23 in the opening frame Thursday and held Indiana to 45 at the intermission. Tyrese Haliburton, the Pacers’ star playmaker who had posted a 30-point triple-doubletwo nights earlier, was held to just eight points on 2-of-7 shooting with six assists.View image in fullscreenKnicks point guard Jalen Brunson dribbles the ball under pressure from Pacers forward Aaron Nesmith on Thursday night.Photograph: Charly Triballeau/AFP/Getty Images“He didn’t get the same looks,” Pacers coach Rick Carlisle said. “Give their defense credit. They had a lot to do with that.”Indiana’s other weapons couldn’t make up the difference. Bennedict Mathurin led the team with 23 points off the bench, but the Pacers as a whole struggled to find their rhythm. Game 2 hero Pascal Siakam had 15. Obi Toppin added 11. As a team, they shot just 40.5% from the field and coughed up 19 turnovers.“We didn’t play with the level of force that we needed to,” Carlisle said. “To start the game, we didn’t have the right level of attitude necessary in this environment. It was a bad start.”It was also the first time in these playoffs Indiana, who came in with a six-game road win streak, had been held under 100 points. After taking a 3-1 series lead on Tuesday’s behind Haliburton’s latest masterclass, the Pacers had looked like a team on the cusp of their second everNBAfinals appearance. But on Thursday, they looked rattled from the jump and New York took complete advantage.Brunson keyed a 23–13 start in the first quarter, and when the Pacers briefly cut the deficit to four, the Knicks responded with a 14–2 second-quarter run to stretch their lead to 48–34. Towns, who scored 12 points in the period, helped New York take a 56–45 lead into half-time.View image in fullscreenMiles Teller looks on as Timothée Chalamet and Spike Lee high five during the first quarter of Thursday’s playoff game between Indiana and New York at Madison Square Garden.Photograph: Al Bello/Getty ImagesIn the third, the Knicks poured it on. Brunson scored their first eight points of the quarter to build a 20-point cushion. Though Indiana briefly clawed back to within 10, a 12–0 New York run – capped by a Brunson four-point play and a Miles McBride jumper – restored order. By the time the fourth quarter began, the Knicks were up 90–73.From there, the Garden crowd could begin to dream in full throat. Fans chanted “Knicks in seven! Knicks in seven!” as the home team closed the show, leading by as many as 20 and never letting Indiana seriously threaten down the stretch.Josh Hart finished with 12 points and 10 rebounds. OG Anunoby and Mikal Bridges added 11 and 12 points respectively. More than just scoring, though, it was the Knicks’ collective urgency and defensive cohesion that defined Game 5.“We played to our standards,” Brunson said. “That’s what it’s going to take.”With Thursday’s win, the Knicks extended their first trip to the conference finals since 2000 and moved one step closer to history. Only 13 teams in NBA history have overturned a 3–1 series deficit, with none having done it in a conference finals after losing the first two games at home.Game 6 will be played Saturday night at Gainbridge Fieldhouse, where the Pacers will have another chance to clinch their first NBA finals berth since 2000, when they bowed to the Los Angeles Lakers in six games. But if the Knicks can replicate Thursday’s effort, they will bring it back to the Garden for a winner-take-all Game 7 that few would have imagined just days ago.Explore more on these topicsNBANew York KnicksIndiana PacersBasketballUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

Experts on whether Andrew Tate and Trump are fleecing their followersAfter I was turned into a memecoin, I looked into the hype behind the crypto that only a tiny percentage of people profit fromMatt SheaFri 30 May 2025 07.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 30 May 2025 19.01 EDTShareIn November last year, I was turned into a memecoin. Several, in fact.Someone alerted me that a memecoin called Dork Nerd Geek ($DNG) had been minted with a picture of my face, and it already had a market cap (the total value of all coins in circulation) of $29,000. Twenty minutes later it was $100,000. An hour later it was $800,000.I had no idea what was going on, but I did know that “Dork Nerd Geek” was the nicknameAndrew Tategave me because I’ve spent much of my journalistic careerinvestigating allegations of human traffickingmade against him.I noticed he was currently livestreaming to his followers. I opened up his live stream and, for the first time, bore witness to the insane volatility of the memecoin market.In the space of 10 minutes, dozens of new me-related memecoins were being minted, including “Disgraced News Gatherer”, “Matt Shea is a faggot,” and “Take My Wife Tate (CUCK),” the latter of which included a picture of my fiancee taken from Instagram. Tate was pumping some of these memecoins in value merely by talking about them, with market fluctuations happening in real time on the order of millions, based on his every word.Two seconds after he said the words “Fuck Matt Shea,” a coin called “FUCK MATT SHAE [sic]” soared in value. Twenty minutes later, he uttered the words “Fuck Matt Shea … ” again and it went even higher, only to drop back down to nothing when he finished his sentence with “… is not a generational asset”. He then said he would pump the coin after taking a piss. He walked offscreen to urinate. It rocketed.View image in fullscreenA memecoin inspired by the writer, Matt Shea, as it was listed on one exchange.Photograph: Matt SheaSoon, there were hundreds more Matt Shea memecoins with similar names, as his followers tried to trick people into thinking thattheirMatt Shea memecoin was the one Tate was pumping. His words became memecoins, those memecoins shot up in value, and then the value disappeared instantaneously.All in all, about $2m was spent by people on memecoins making fun of me in the span of a few hours, and hundreds of millions more on other coins he mentioned during the stream.By the end of his live stream, the value of all the coins he pumped was back to near zero. All the fans who had invested at his behest collectively would have lost hundreds of millions of dollars.His followers may have felt they were in on the joke, but in the end they mostly lost their money. Only a tiny number of wallets actually profited from the coin including onecryptothat made a profit of $240,000.‘Roadmap for corruption’: Trump dive into cryptocurrency raises ethics alarmRead moreA number of online crypto investigators includingCoffeezilla,bored2boar,StarPlatinumand others have found that Tate has manipulated memecoin markets using “pump and dump”-like schemes, leading to large profits for those within his inner circle. We put the allegations in these investigations to Tate’s team, who said they had no comment.What happened on Tate’s stream that day felt bizarre but I didn’t completely understand what I was witnessing. I thought I basically understood bitcoin, but how do memecoins differ, and why do they continue to be popular when so many people have lost money on them?Is every memecoin a scam?According to David Gerard, the author of Attack of the 50 Foot Blockchain: “Basically, literally, yes.”“All of this is like a big game of pretend with made-up financial instruments,” he said. “It’s printing your own made-up money. You print your own Monopoly money and then people buy it from you for real money.”The best thing you could possibly say about memecoins is that they initially felt like a funny, countercultural way to participate in internet culture. They satirised a financial system that increasingly looked like a silly game to those on the outside. They encapsulated a humorous generational nihilism.All crypto is bullshit, but memecoins are consciously bullshitAccording to Sander Lutz, the nation’s first crypto-focused White House correspondent: “You could consider a memecoin to be a stock in a cultural phenomenon – like Dogecoin and the Doge meme.”“Another way of defining a memecoin,” Lutz said, “is a cryptocurrency token that has an acknowledged inherent lack of value. The crypto world, outside of memecoins, is full of so many people who are trying to pitch you on tokens that are ‘actually really profound’ or ‘represent a stake’ in some kind of ‘useful network’, but are equally worthless. What makes memecoins different is that there’s none of that noise.”In other words, all crypto is bullshit, but memecoins are consciously bullshit.In their essence, memecoins distill the attention economy into a tradable asset, monetising the ebb and flow of viral internet hype. This has created a system in which the biggest attention-seekers on the planet – Logan Paul, Andrew Tate,Elon Musk,Donald Trump– can bleed their followers for profit. The more controversial they are, the more viral they are; and the more viral they are, the more their memecoins increase in value. Last year, some developers performed attention-seeking stunts on livestreams to pump their tokens, leading toanimal abuse and a faked suicide.Chase Herro, the co-founder of Trump’s main crypto venture, World Liberty Financial, said about crypto: “You can literally sell shit in a can, wrapped in piss, covered in human skin, for a billion dollars if the story’s right, because people will buy it.”Most memecoins end up making money for the person who makes them as a “rug pull” or a “pump and dump”. The term “rug pull” was actually invented by the crypto community, and it works like this:First, you mint a memecoin, and make sure that you and your mates own most of the liquidity pool (the total number of coins in circulation). The size of the liquidity pool – the amount of that memecoin that “exists” – is, like everything else in memecoins, a totally made-up number.Second, you generate hype around the coin by convincing people it will “moon” (shoot up in value). This usually involves getting a celebrity, influencer or the president of the US, to promote it. People then buy the coin, thinking it will be a good investment. Law of demand means that as people buy it, the “value” of the coin goes up, and since you and your mates own the lion’s share, you get richer.The only way you get money is by other people losing moneyDavid GerardThen, at a time known only to you, the creator of the coin, and other insiders, you “pull the rug”, selling off all your stock at the newly high price. You make money, and the value of the coins bought by the masses you manipulated shoots back down to zero. It’s basically a way to just trick people into giving you money, dressed up as an “investment”.A “pump and dump” is pretty much the same thing, but with the slight caveat that you’re doing it with a coin that already exists, rather than creating your own. You buy a cheap coin, “pump” its value by hyping it so others invest, then “dump” all your stock, selling it off at a huge profit and causing everyone else to lose their money.“It’s provably negative sum,” Gerard told me. “The only way you get money is by other people losing money.”The only people really getting rich off memecoins are influencers and their crypto enablers (people like Herro, or Hayden Davis, the guy who helped launch Argentinian president Javier Milei’s memecoin and was involved in Melania Trump’s memecoin).View image in fullscreenDogecoin, the best-known memecoin. The only people getting rich off such crypto are influencers and their enablers.Photograph: Dado Ruvić/ReutersDespite this, the idea that trading memecoins is a good way to get rich persists on the internet. Is it theoretically possible for someone like you or me to invest at just the right time and get rich off a coin?Just as with traditional gambling, there are a tiny number of success stories, such as people like the “Moo Deng whale”, who turned$800of Moo Deng coin (a memecoin referencing theviral pygmy hippoof the same name), into $10m.But only 0.4% ofPump.fun (the main memecoin trading platform)traders have made more than $10,000. About 0.002% have made more than $1m.Lutz told me: “There are a select number of people who’ve made quite a lot of money on these tokens, but they tend to be the same people. They tend to be people who are very well-connected, who are in specific group chats, and who have a lot of existing capital.”“You’ll always have more people losing than amounts of winners,” according to Gerard. “And the winners never shut up, so you think it’s a winning environment.”One of the main reasons people keep falling for these coins is that they think they’ve figured out the scam and invested early, before the rug pull or the dump. But this is never really the case.According to Gerard: “Crypto has been an ever-escalating series of get-rich-quick schemes, where a whole bunch of people think that they’re smarter operators than the previous operator, and generally they’re not.”Memecoin traders will often be invited to Discord and Telegram chats that are sold as “insider channels” where, according to Gerard, “they think they’ll hear about these scams before the rug is pulled – but actually they’re the suckers. Crypto is full of people who think they’re the scammer, not the sucker.”Young gullible menDespite all this, many people – especially young men – continue to invest in memecoins.Forty-two percent of men and 17% of women aged 18 to 29 have invested in, traded or used crypto, according to a 2024Pew Research Center study, compared to only 11% of men and 5% of women over 50.“It’s no accident that memecoins are such a phenomenon among young people who have grown immensely frustrated with a financial system that, I think it’s fair to say, has failed them,” Lutz explained, “and where supposedly sure investments aren’t likely to give them returns that would give them the quality of life their parents had. Memecoins are nakedly meaningless, but there are many financial products, both in crypto and in the world of traditional finance, that may profess to have meaning, but at their core may be nearly as meaningless to young people.”This, too, is why memecoins have become popular with far-right,manosphereinfluencers and their fans.There’s no existing infrastructure to aid people who lose all of their savings on memecoinsSander Lutz“It’s undeniable,” Lutz said, “that the trend in memecoin popularity among younger people – in particular young men – is part of the same trend where you’re seeing a loss of trust in institutions and a loss of confidence that traditional paths to success work out.”“These are the same tenets that have brought young men into the fold of the Maga-verse or to influencers likeAndrew Tate. There’s overlap between them because they both stem from the same frustrations affecting so many young people, in particular young men, who feel more anger, bitterness, disillusionment and nihilism than a generation ago.”Some people don’t even seem to care that they’re being scammed, according to Lutz. “It’s remarkable to see the culture in these ecosystems, because someone will rug-pull a project – what you would consider to be a scam in that they’re running you out of the money – but that’s kind of an accepted practice and people are like: ‘Hey, good for them, I got screwed over, on to the next one.’”“There are too many cases to count of people who’ve lost their entire savings gambling on new coins. If you’re a gambler at a casino, there’s Gamblers Anonymous and an existing infrastructure to deal with people who are addicted to gambling. At casinos you have ‘no play’ lists in compliance with existing laws. There’s no existing infrastructure to aid people who lose all of their savings on memecoins.”Some memecoins try to claim that they’re more than just high-stakes gambling, in order to ensnare more willing buyers. These coins are often accompanied by the false promise of some kind of utility, be it “roadmaps”, “airdrops” ( free tokens given out for marketing purposes), off-chain value mechanisms, games where you can “spend” the coins, and various incomprehensible frameworks using the coin to vote or create some sort of ecosystem. The utility almost never materialises. $Batman coin promised to integrate “entertainment, gaming, and real-world utility”. Paul’s $ZooToken supposedly allowed buyers to play a Pokemon-like gamethat never worked.The exception, the one memecoin to offer a tangible benefit in the real world, is the one sold by the president.President MemeOn 17 January, three days before his second inauguration, Trump launched his own memecoin, $Trump. At the time of writing, the coin’s market cap is over $2.5bn, spurred on by Trump offering a dinner and White House tour to the top owners of the coin, which took place last weekend.Unlike other memecoins, it offered something concrete: access to the president. This made its value soar.View image in fullscreenA protest at Trump National golf club in Sterling, Virginia.Photograph: Rod Lamkey/APRight now, only 20% of the token’s total “supply” is currently in circulation. The remaining 80% is supposedly held by Trump and his business partners.Trump and his business partners are supposedly only allowed to sell off their holdings in $Trump when they are “unlocked” in tranches over time, according to their own made-up rules. As Gerard puts it: “They own the fake money, but they can’t sell it until it’s unlocked in tranches. Note that the limits are artificial. I mean, they could just ‘print’ more.”But already, “58 wallets have made over $10m each from President Donald Trump’s meme coin, totaling $1.1bn in profits”, while “764,000 wallets of mostly small holders have lost money on $TRUMP”, according toCNBC.Gerard said: “A lot of his own fans bought the coin. They thought it would be a fabulous success because Trump is a ‘business genius’. He ripped off his own fans.“The coins’ creators and original sponsors get free $Trump coins and they can dump those on the market at will every time a tranche is released. And they do. And are people ever going to make money on those $Trump coins they bought? Probably not. The money goes to the Trump family, and that’s the direction it was created to make it go in. So yeah, it’s a memecoin dump. He’s just dumping the coins on the suckers and it’s a textbook case.”Trump and his business partners also profit in transaction fees every time $Trump is traded,so far earning $100m.Whether this is all legal or not is up for debate, but soon after launching his own memecoin, Trump replaced the head of the regulator responsible for memecoins, the SEC, with a pro-crypto appointee.It is absolutely the government’s job to stop mis-selling of investmentsDavid GerardLutz said: “In the last few months, the SEC has either dismissed or withdrawn all of its crypto-related lawsuits against every big crypto company in the United States and closed all of its investigations. I mean, the SEC is hosting roundtables almost every week with crypto companies, asking how it can be more helpful to the industry.”Trump has also enthusiastically supported a legal framework for stablecoins. Stablecoins are theoretically stabilised in value by being “pegged” to the value of another asset like the US dollar, but in reality have often become “de-pegged” and therefore unstable.Right now, the Stable Bill and the Genius Bill, which reference Trump calling himself a “stable genius” in 2018, are trying to make their way through Congress. They pave the way for the US government to use stablecoins to pay everything fromhousing grants to social security payments. And Trump himself just so happens to have a stablecoin of his own – through the World Liberty Financial company – which would shoot up in value if these bills pass, earning his family trust potential billions.The Trump family has a claim on 75% of net revenues from World Liberty’s token sales.“It is absolutely the government’s job to stop mis-selling of investments – that’s why ordinary retail mums and dads cannot buy into binary options,” Gerard said. “It’s absolutely open slather for crypto in the US now. This is really bad. A lot of people are going to get skinned. It’s going to be terrible.”The advice? Stay awayIs there any cause for hope? According to Gerard, while it may appear everyone is investing in memecoins, this is mainly exaggerated by the media. Sure, lots of young people have dabbled, but only the real crypto geeks are actually buying the things.From Dogecoin to $Trump: everything you need know about the wild world of meme coinsRead more“The good news is most people are not falling for it. And our evidence for this is the retail dollar trading volumes at Coinbase, the largest crypto dollar exchange. Coinbase happens to be a public company so that means they have to give accurate numbers to the SEC. So they disclosed their retail trading volumes. They’re down 17% in the first quarter of 2025 from where they were in December 2024. They’ve gone down with the Trump coin regime. That gives hope.”As far as my own memecoins go, even the Tate fans who invested appear to have become aware of the scam they fell for.Shortly after the stream went dead, I received an email from a Tate follower titled: “MATT SHAE WE NEED YOUR HELP.” He, along with other Tate fans, claimed they were victims of Tate rug-pulling them. They wanted me to help spread awareness of their community’s plight – by publicizing a new memecoin they had minted called $RRT (Real Rugger Tate).I didn’t write back.Explore more on these topicsCryptocurrenciesDonald TrumpTrump administrationUS politicsAndrew TatefeaturesShareReuse this content"

The phenomenon also affected parts of Belgium and the Netherlands.Looking for the last human place on the internet? Try Google MapsRead moreThose relying on Google Maps were left with the impression that large parts of Germany had ground to a halt. The situation was compounded by the fact that large numbers of Germans were on the road at the start of a four-day break for the Ascension holiday.The closure reports led to the clogging of alternative routes on smaller thoroughfares and lengthy delays as people scrambled to find detours. Police and road traffic control authorities had to answer a flood of queries as people contacted them for help.Drivers using or switching to alternative apps, such as Apple Maps or Waze, or turning to traffic news on their radios, were given a completely contrasting picture, reflecting the reality that traffic was mostly flowing freely on the apparently affected routes.In ganz DeutschlandChaos bei Google Maps: Dienst zeigt unzählige falsche Sperrungenhttps://t.co/qEfIRrIHx3— Peter Berger (@leosgeminix)May 29, 2025On social media, users queried the situation and vented their frustration. “They can’t have closed ALL the motorways,” one user said.

It’s like Waiting for Godot with gummy bears instead of trampsFri 30 May 2025 08.02 EDTLast modified on Fri 30 May 2025 11.08 EDTShareAs long as I can remember, my wife has started each day with 30 minutes of a Candy Crush game. As long as she can remember, I have started each day by telling her it is pointless casual gamer cack. Now I write for the Guardian, I need to find a more eloquent way of putting that, so I thought I would have a go myself. I am begging you: do not do the same. Candy Crush Soda Saga nearly ruined me in a week.I like the game mechanics. As Oscar Wilde said, the man who doesn’t love sliding stuff to form chains of three or more matching shapes does not love life itself. This one is wrapped in a cute candy veneer, all fizzy bottles and gummy bears. And that makes the visuals so alluring. When you slide a Colour Bomb into a Candy Fish all the candies that colour get Candyfished and your eyes are treated to a bazillion of them fizzing around the screen destroying everything, while the firm yet gentle haptic feedback makes it a multisensory burst of pure, effervescent joy.“What’s that clicking noise?” my wife asks.“Don’t you play it with the haptic feedback on?”“Oh, I turned that off because I thought it was hurting my phone.”“In what way?”“I felt it was putting too much … pressure on it.” She says, like her phone is the USS Enterprise and she is Scotty diverting a dangerous amount of power away from the shields.We had many chats about Candy Crush while we both played the game in bed. I’m all for increased interspousal communication, but we used to do this kind of thing with broadsheet newspapers and now we’re matching jelly beans on phones. Luckily, you just need one hand to play, so the other is free to punch yourself repeatedly in the face as you realise how pointless your life has become.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toPushing ButtonsFree weekly newsletterKeza MacDonald's weekly look at the world of gamingEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionYou are so hooked by the mechanics you hand over your few quid for some extra virtual bobbins quicker than those kids getting drugs in The WireAnd this game is utterly pointless in the long run. There is no story, no real achievements. It uses a board game path to fake big-time progression, but whether it’s me on level 150 or my wife on level 8,452 (gulp!) the pattern is the same: a few easy levels then a super hard one which, if you haven’t accumulated enough power-ups, is virtually impossible.That’s when the game drops its trousers and flashes its microtransactions. And by that stage you are so hooked by the mechanics and the colour you hand over your few quid for some extra virtual visual bobbins quicker and easier than those crazy kids getting drugs in The Wire. Oh yes! Candy Crush Soda Saga is the game Stringer Bell went to business school to invent. The cigarette was once hailed as the most efficient poison delivery system ever invented. Not now.This game “suggests” moves to you. These are frequently not the best ones. That is no accident. This is a game designed to make you fail. It’s a compulsion loop, sure, but one that encourages you to pay for the pleasure. It’s not gambling per se, because you know what you are buying, but, while gambling company ads nowscreamabout setting limits and walking away, this game screams at you to have one more go.I have been addicted to so many things in my life that I stopped counting. (I became addicted to counting my addictions as well.) But this ranks as one of the worst. It only takes three days until I am dangerously hooked. Last Sunday I played Candy Crush Pop Saga for three solid hours. I nearly missed theScottish Cup finalas a result. Unlike my wife, I was dipping into it during the rest of the day as well, thinking, “Oh it’s been 15 minutes, I may have ended up getting a power-up via the Bake a Cake sub game my Candy Crush team are helping me with.”The self-loathing of the addict envelopes me. I know this is not nurturing me in any way, but I cannot stop. At least cocaine was quick. In terms of time? In one week I wasted what could have been, in Zelda terms, one third of a Breath of the Wild, one half of a Twilight Princess or an entire Majora’s Mask. And at least they tell stories. If the deadline for this article hadn’t made me stop, I would have had to have buried my phone in a lime pit and set it on fire to escape from Candy Crush.The irony is that there’s no real difference between this and the arcade offerings that made me fall in love with gaming as child. Pacman, Frogger, Space Invaders et al were all designed to make you pump another coin in the slot when it winked CONTINUE Y/N at you. They were even more repetitive. So I guess by the definition detailed in this Candy Crush castigation, those games were also a waste of time.But why didn’t they feel like that?Because back then, all I had was time. It wasn’t the dwindling commodity it is in my 50s. Maybe if I played Galaxian now it would feel like playing Candy Crush: a descent into a gaming horror world so uncomfortable it’s like watching that Event Horizon movie on treadmill while wearing Lego pants. A game that offers nothing repeatedly. Waiting for Godot with gummy bears instead of tramps. Nothing happens, nobody comes, nobody goes – it’s awful.Explore more on these topicsGamesGame cultureMobile gamescommentShareReuse this content"

At some level you have to salute Donald Trump’s ability to turn even the world’s richest man into an Apprentice candidate who leaves in week four after completely wiping out in the hotdog stand task.Musk arrived in government promising toslash spending by $2tn. He leaves it a mere $1.86tn short of that target, even by his own estimations. Meanwhile, the president’s new tax bill is set to add $2.3tn to the deficit. I imagine Musk thought his government finale would be a spectacular extravaganza – “you’re welcome, Washington!” – involving 2,000 chainsaw-wielding chorus girls. Instead, it’s a tweet. And yes – we DO all still call them tweets.Ironically, the thing that Musk has been most stunningly effective at slashing is his own reputation. Think about it. He arrived in Trump’s orbit as a somewhat mysterious man, widely regarded as a tech genius, and a titan of the age. He leaves it with vast numbers of people woken up to the fact he’s a weird andcreepy breeding fetishist, who desperately pretends to be good at video games, and wasn’t remotely as key to SpaceX or Tesla’s engineering prowess as they’d vaguely thought. Also, with a number of them apparently convinced he had a botched penile implant. Rightly or wrongly convinced – sure. I’m just asking questions.But look, it’s good news for Tesla investors, who have managed to end Musk’s practice of WFWH (working from White House), and are now demandinghe puts in a 40-hour weekto save the company whose stock he has spent the past few months tanking. As the world order dramatically seeks to rearrange itself in the new era of US unreliability, no one should ever be able to unsee the president of the United States’s decision to turn the White House lawn into acar sales lot for his sad friend. Did it work? It seems not. Musk spent a lot of this week airing his hurt feelings about his brrm-brrm cars. “People were burning Teslas,”he whinedto Jeff Bezos’s Washington Post. “Why would you do that? That’s really uncool.”Well, one thing we will no longer have to endure is this guy’s decrees on what is or isn’t cool. The timeworn thing about money and power is that they allow nerds to reinvent themselves as cool. You see it on Wall Street, where sea-beast financiers get manscaped by trophy wives who are no longer out of their league. You see it in Hollywood, where weird little guys become alpha movie producers. You see it inBezos’s transformationfrom puffy-chinos-wearing, dress-down-Friday dweeb to Bilderberg Vin Diesel impersonator. What you rarely see is the alchemy of that process in reverse, live and in real time. But we got that with Elon, and we have to take our laughs where we can. In some other businesses, Musk could have convinced himself it wasn’t happening, but politics is a place where pollsters literally ask real people what they think of public figures every single week. Elon’sapproval ratingsare underwater.No doubt we’re this close to him identifying the real problem: that we simply need new voters. Musk has long been convinced that people don’t know how to handle his genius in all fields. Four years ago, he hosted Saturday Night Live, and sometime afterwardsrevealed on a podcasthow the cast and writers had reacted to the uncontainably hilarious suggestions made by him and his team of bros. “We come in just, like, guns blazing with ideas,” he honked, explaining he’d pitched a … bit, is it? … where he was “going to take my cock out. So I’m going to reach down into my pants … and then I pull out a baby rooster. Like, ‘This is my tiny cock.’” Oh very good, sir. Absolute genius, sir. Presumably terrified that they would lose their jobs for ever to this superlative talent, the SNL team declined to “yes-and” this genius sketch into the final show running order, but Musk managed to get his own back – at least in his account of hosting an episode with aflattering 13% ratingon Rotten Tomatoes. “There’s a bunch of things that I said that were just not on the script. They have these cue cards for what you’re supposed to say, and I just didn’t say it. I just went off the rails.”Mm. Just like you have now. As for where Musk goes next, he’s obviouslybuilding a Texan compoundfor the mothers of his many babies. But, psychologically, Mars would seem to be the answer. After a humiliation this big, only colonising another planet feels like the appropriately sized salve. It doesn’t matter that Mars is an obvious shithole that looks like the least appealing disused quarry on Earth – a place so bleak and empty that if they found one single fossilised flower it would be celebrated like the holy grail, even though the impossible majesty of the Amazon rainforest is right here. But of course, the point of Mars is that it would be the place of Elon, Teslamandias, king of kings. And you know, I feel more confident than ever that we could all look upon his works and despair.Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsElon MuskOpinionTrump administrationUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

But history may mark 14 June as the ceremonial birth of US fascismFri 30 May 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 30 May 2025 12.44 EDTShareIn 2017, watching a two-hour Bastille Day procession, Donald Trumptoldthe French president that we’d have one too, only better. That time, the grown-ups said no. The reasons given were costs – estimates ran to$92m–hellish logistics, and the Washington DC mayor Muriel Bowser’s worries that tanks and other armored vehicles would tear up Washington’s streets.Someretired generalsobjected publicly to the totalitarian-adjacent optics, especially given the US president’s praise for such bad actors asSaddam HusseinandVladimir Putin. Several Republican lawmakers also expressed their distaste. “Confidence is silent, and insecurity is loud,” the Louisiana senator John Kennedy toldMSNBC. “America is the most powerful country in all of human history ... and we don’t need to show it off. We’re not North Korea. We’re not Russia, we’re not China,” he continued, “and I don’t wanna be.”This time, as Washington prepares for a huge military shindig on 14 June, Trump’s 79th – and, oh yes, the US army’s 250th – birthday, the generals are silent. TheRepublicanshave sworn allegiance to the king. And the media are focused on the price tag, the potholes and the impending pomp; on tensions between the blue city of Washington and the red capital; and on the decimation of veterans’ healthcare, housing, and pensions while the administration throws $25m to $45m at a circus of war.All are important parts of the story. Yet commentary is muted and the debate mischaracterized as normal political discourse. The horrific point is missed: the spectacle of a massive show of military might, before a president who behaves like a dictator and views the armed forces as his personal foot soldiers, evinces memories of the worst totalitarian regimes. History may mark 14 June 2025 as the ceremonial birth of a new American fascism.It’s been a big, beautiful week of bad news for Trump. But don’t expect it to stick | Zoe WilliamsRead moreMilitary Parade in Capital on Trump’s Birthday Could Cost $45 Million, Officials Say, reported theNew York Timesin mid-May.CBSalso led with the cost. TheWashingtoniandescribed in detail the street-damage-preventive measures the army is installing: metal plates under the parade route, rubber padding on the tank treads – though transportation experts warn that running, at last count, 28 Abrams tanks, 28 Bradley fighting vehicles, 28 Strykers, and four Paladins, each behemoth weighing as much as70 tonnes, could buckle the asphalt and smash power, water and telecom lines underneath.Even theNew Republic, the president’s daily disparager, put the cost up top, tallied the ordinance, and noted that the man who “signed an executive order creating a program to ‘beautify Washington DC’” was now “plotting to transform his expensive birthday party into a demolition derby that will cause serious damage to the roads that line the nation’s capital”.In late May, three weeks after theAssociated Pressfirst revealed the parade plan, the army promised it would pay to fix the streets. It did not commit to picking up the multimillion-dollar tab for policing and cleanup, however, which will come out of a city budget from which the House cut$1.1bnin March and didn’t get around to restoring.Still, the partial resolution of the infrastructure problems liberated the press to get on with the fun stuff: “what to expect” on the festive day: not just planes, tanks and 6,700 soldiers, but also fireworks, football players and fitness competitions.USA Todaylinked to the free tickets page and published the parade route, plus a map of the military goodies on display, including robots and night-vision goggles. It called the event an “unofficial birthday party”.ABC Newsran a feature on Doc Holliday, the dog who will join the parade in a mule-drawn cart.Tucked into some stories was a sentence or two indicating controversy, such as this fromReuters: “Critics have called a parade an authoritarian display of power that is wasteful, especially as Trump slashes costs throughout the federal government.”“The plans have drawn some criticism from Democrats,” saidCBS.The Hillwrote: “Democrats and critics have questioned both the cost of the parade and whether it politicizes the military, which has traditionally been nonpartisan. The fact that the parade falls on Trump’s birthday has only fueled criticism from Democrats who view it as a way for the president to celebrate himself.”Over at Fox, they were telling the critics to get over themselves. “The Democratic party, they’ve chosen to be an outrage machine at a time when there is outrage fatigue in this country,”scoffed Kayleigh McEnany, Trump’s former press secretary and current Fox News host. “People are fed up with the ‘authoritarianism coup’ language.”It’s true. Only one party is complaining. But what is striking about their complaints is the relative dearth of authoritarian coup language. “The egotist-in-chief wants taxpayers to foot the bill for a military parade on his birthday,” saidSteve Cohen, a US representative from Tennessee, in a statement. As if the president were moved by mere narcissism.ReportedForbeson 15 May: “There has been no formal pushback to the proposal.”Trump likes hulking lethal toys, but he hasn’t always been partial to the people who run them. There was thefighthe picked with a couple of Muslim Gold Star parents during his first campaign; thecommentson a 2018 European trip that fallen soldiers are “losers” and “suckers”; the undisguisedqueasinessabout seeing or being seen with wounded veterans; the Pentagon session where he called his top officers“a bunch of dopes and babies”.But he is warming to the role of commander in chief. In hiscommencement speechat West Point, between bloviations on Nato, drag shows, golf and trophy wives, he boasted about the unprecedented $1.1tn military budget. “You’ll become officers in the greatest and most powerful army the world has ever known,” he said. “And I know because I rebuilt that army, and I rebuilt the military ... like nobody has ever rebuilt it before.”Will Donald Trump defy the US supreme court? | Steven GreenhouseRead moreAlso breaking from script onMemorial Dayat Arlington Cemetery, he suggested that the parade, on top of nabbing the World Cup and the Olympics, was divinely ordained. “Look what I have, I have everything,” he cried. “Amazing the way things work out. God did that.”If he is to ease from commander of the armed forces to commander of everything, he will need more than God on his side. He’ll need to own the military. Forty-five million bucks is a good starting bid.Stalin’s 50th birthday celebration, in 1929, is considered the kickoff of his cult of personality.

The website of America250, the non-profit fundraising and marketing arm of the Semiquincentennial Commission, is an advertisement for Trump. Its description of the “grand military parade” refers to him in the second sentence andproclaimsthat under his “leadership, the U.S. Army has been restored to strength and readiness”.At the parade, the crowd of200,000spectators will be dominated by Maga idol worshippers. Trump will watch the extravaganza from a reviewing stand, just likeXi Jinping and Putindid recently at Red Square.

They woke each morning to the voices of their mothers urging them to get ready for school, not to the sound of airstrikes and screaming. They were focused on building a future, working hard to shape a better life for themselves and their homeland.Before the war started, my best friends and I used to go to the restaurants that were near the university, talking, laughing, eating and studying together, eating our breakfast together under a blue sky before going to the first lecture.Before the war, all the schools and universities were alive with the energy of students and teachers. Now, many of those buildings have been reduced to rubble. The last day students attended school was Thursday, 5 October 2023. That day became a tragic dividing line between normalcy and chaos, between life and death.On that day, my first lecture was the poetry course with Dr Refaat Alareer. He entered the class, holding his MacBook and the textbook for our class. I remember the first lecture in the first semester, he began with a discussion of a poem, and his way of teaching was perfect, and every single word he spoke held the attention of all the students. His lectures were like performances, and each one was a tale.On the night of 6 October, I couldn’t sleep, and I didn’t know why. I closed my eyes and tried to sleep, but all my attempts were in vain. I started to worry about what would happen the next day if I had no sleep. What if I woke up late and missed the beginning of Dr Refaat’s lecture? Finally, I slept, and when I woke up it was not from the sound of my alarm, but from the pounding of bombs. To this day, I wish I could go to sleep and wake up to go to my university, as though this terrible war were just a nightmare that never really happened.Thousands of students have been killed by the occupation in a brutal, ongoing genocide that has shattered souls, destroyed homes, and turned every street corner into a place of mourning. Tens of thousands more have been injured, displaced, or forced to flee from one temporary shelter to another. My poetry teacher, Dr Refaat, who was an internationally acclaimed poet, was killed in December 2023.Since the beginning of the war, life has become a daily struggle, surviving in tents, under fire, surrounded by destruction. These students have witnessed scenes no one should ever see: death, bloodshed, and heartbreak. Despite all this, education remains a lifeline, a small piece of hope and normalcy amid the horror.Even before they could return to their studies, they were forced to learn new, harsh lessons: how to move quickly under fire, how to fetch water from distant places, how to bury loved ones alone, because in Gaza, every day brings another funeral.Many students returned to their schools not to study, but to find shelter with their families. A few tried to resume their lessons in makeshift tents, guided by university students or teachers still devoted to education. Some university students turned to e-learning with local universities, while others applied abroad in search of a future.My sister, who is in high school, is studying on her own despite the lack of books. She could study only in the morning because there is no electricity or lights at night.No schoolbooks are available in the city, people burned them as fuel for cooking. Students also need paper, but it is too expensive now. Students pay one dollar for one sheet of paper; students are trying to download and print out PDFs of books they need for class. How can they possibly buy or print more than hundred pages for every single book?As a university student myself, I completed my third year during the war. I faced countless challenges. The internet would disconnect during exams or lectures, leaving me helpless. I remember attending a class on my phone, hiding beneath a staircase while the sky outside burned red. I couldn’t hear my professor over the sound of drones, but I refused to miss a single lesson.This was supposed to be the year of my graduation, the year I would stand among friends and colleagues, wearing caps and gowns on our university’s stage. But everything has changed. Many of our classmates have been killed, one after another, and our university stage was burned down and turned into a shelter. They replaced graduating students with tents, they replaced the songs of celebration with the sounds of the death.Despite the horror, we students of Gaza still hold our pens like weapons of truth. We write, we learn, we dream. Our schools may be reduced to rubble, but our will is stronger than any bomb.Nadera Mushtha is a writer and poet from Gaza who is studying English language education at the Islamic University of Gaza.

Never since its establishment has the state of Israel waged such a war. The criminal gang headed by Benjamin Netanyahu has set a precedent without equal in Israel’s history in this area, too.The obvious result of Operation Gideon’s Chariots is, first and foremost, the confused activity of Israeli military units deployed around Gaza. This is true particularly in neighborhoods where our soldiers have already fought, were hurt and fell while killing many Hamas combatants, who deserve to die, andmany more innocent civilians. These have joined the statistics of pointless victims among the Palestinian population, reaching monstrous proportions.Recent operations in Gaza have nothing to do with legitimate war goals. The government sends our soldiers – and the military obeys – to wander around Gaza City, Jabalya and Khan Younis neighborhoods in an illegitimate military operation. This is now aprivate political war. Its immediate result is the transformation of Gaza into a humanitarian disaster area.Over the past year, harsh accusations were voiced worldwide against the Israeli government and its military’s conduct in Gaza, including accusations of genocide and war crimes. In public debates in Israel and on the international arena, I’ve rejected such accusations firmly, though I didn’t shrink from criticizing the government. The international media listens to all voices in the public debate in Israel. It can discern between those who serve asmouthpieces for Netanyahuand his lackeys and his opponents, who view him, as the media is currently fond of saying, as the head of a crime family. I didn’t hesitate to give interviews in Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, the UK and elsewhere in the international arena. Quite often, I disappointed interviewers when I vehemently asserted that Israel wasn’t committing war crimes in Gaza. Excessive killing happened, but, I claimed firmly and with conviction, in no case did a government official give orders to hit Gazan civilians indiscriminately.The great number of innocent civilians killed inGazawas hard to fathom, unjustified, unacceptable. But all, as I have said on every media outlet in the world, resulted from a vicious war.This war should have ended by early 2024. It continued without justification, without any clear goal, and with no political vision for the future of Gaza and the Middle East in general. The military, charged with and duty-bound to execute government orders, acted in many cases rashly, incautiously, over-aggressively. However, it did so without any order or instruction or directive from military top brass to hit civilians indiscriminately. Therefore, as I understood it at the time, no war crimes had been committed.Genocide and war crimes are legal terms that very much refer to the intent and responsibility of the people authorized to formulate the war’s objectives, its conduct and its purpose, the boundaries of fighting and the limitations on the use of force. I took every available opportunity to distinguish between the crimes we have been accused of, which I refused to admit, and thecarelessness and indifference regarding Gazan victimsand the unbearable human cost we’ve been levying there. The first accusation I rejected, the second I admitted to.In recent weeks I’ve been no longer able to do so. What we are doing in Gaza now is a war of devastation: the indiscriminate, limitless, cruel and criminal killing of civilians. We’re not doing this due to loss of control in any specific sector, not due to some disproportionate outburst by some soldiers in some unit. Rather, it’s the result of government policy – knowingly, evilly, maliciously, irresponsibly dictated. Yes, Israel is committing war crimes.First, starving out Gaza. On this issue, the position of senior government figures is public and clear. Yes, we’ve been denying Gazans food, medicine and basic living needs as part of an explicit policy. Netanyahu, typically, is trying to blur the type of orders he’s been giving, in order to evade legal and criminal responsibility in due course. But some of his lackeys are saying so outright, in public, even with pride: Yes, we will starve out Gaza. Because all Gazans are Hamas, there’s no moral or operational limitation on exterminating them all, over 2 million people.Israeli media outlets, each for its own reasons (some understandable) are trying to present a moderate version of events in Gaza. But the picture displayed around the world is much broader, much more devastating. It’s impossible to view it with equanimity and a nod, as if the world’s reaction is merely a widespread outburst of antisemitism, because everybody hates us and they’re all antisemites.I believe the government of Israel is now the enemy from within. It has declared war on the state and its inhabitantsWell, no. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, is no antisemite. I know him well. I’ve been talking to him over the last few months. When the hour was at hand, the French military stood on the frontline to defend Israel and cooperated in intercepting Iran’s missile attacks. “We’re fighting with you against your enemies under my direction, and you’ve beenaccusing me of supporting terrorism,” Macron recently said. He is a friend of Israel, as are the British prime minister, Keir Starmer; the Dutch prime minister, Dick Schoof; the Italian prime minister, Giorgia Meloni; and many others who’ve joined them from within the ranks of Europe’s most outstanding and important cabinet ministers and leaders.They’ve been hearing the voices from Gaza. They see the suffering of hundreds of thousands of civilians. They’ve been hearing the voices from Israeli cabinet meetings and realize the obvious: Israeli cabinet ministers, headed by crime boss Netanyahu, are actively, unhesitatingly and with malice aforethought pursuing a policy of starvation and humanitarian pressure, with potentially catastrophic results.Voices are already rising from Israel-friendly governments such as Canada, the UK and France, calling for concrete measures against the government, though these could cause grievous harm to Israel. Macron suggested a review of the association agreement between Israel and the European Union, a suggestion seconded by the prime ministers of Spain, the Netherlands and Italy. These latter two, unlike Macron, are both rightwing leaders, and until recently had declined any move that could have embarrassed Israel.These voices will grow. There’s a risk that tangible punishment will be directed at Israel beyond steps by the international criminal court at The Hague, with lethal financial and diplomatic results.The Netanyahu government’s choir of thugs and the poison machine it has been operating will immediately decry typical victimization:the Gentiles are antisemites. They hate us. They’ve always been against us. They support terrorism – while we fight terrorism. In truth, these governments aren’t anti-Israeli, they oppose the Israeli government. They believe the government has declared war on the state of Israel and its inhabitants, and it may have caused irreversible damage.I concur. I believe the government of Israel is now the enemy from within. It has declared war on the state and its inhabitants. No external foe we’ve fought against over the past 77 years has caused greater damage to Israel than what the Itamar Ben-Gvir, Netanyahu and Bezalel Smotrich-led government has inflicted on us. No external foe managed to devastate the social solidarity that was the basis of Israeli society’s strength in all existential tests facing it since 1948, as the Netanyahu government has done and does.I will briefly repeat here what has already become accepted wisdom in large parts of the Israeli public: this government is unworthy. It cannot, nor does it wish to do what is good for the country and its citizens. It’s entirely preoccupied with destroying any basis for internal unity, for cooperation between communities, which may disagree over core issues. It’sdriven by some crazed enthusiasmto pit brother against brother, mother against children, soldiers against soldiers, punks and thugs against hostages and their families. It takes sadistic, sick, irresponsible and merry joy in this, while of course failing to bring back the hostages.And while all this mess is going on, we keep on slaughtering Palestinian civilians in theWest Bank, too. I have said so before, and I will not go back on my word. Members of the horrible hilltop youth are daily perpetrating heinous crimes all over the West Bank, while the police and military units deployed in the area are turning a blind eye.The murder of Tzeela Gez is horrifying. One cannot but feel pain over the fate of this young woman and over the tragedy to which she fell victim on her way to the hospital to give birth to her son. May he survive and grow up in the bosom of his loving family, who will surely protect him. But the statement by head of the Samaria Regional Council, Yossi Dagan, saying that Palestinian villages must be destroyed is a declaration of genocide.When aPalestinian village burns down, and quite a few already have, they’ll tell us that the perpetrators are a small, violent group that does not represent settlers. This is a lie. They are many. The vanguard is always smaller. Behind it are the Yossi Dagans who are inspiring them, helping them to avoid exposure and preparing the next wave of rioters. Where are the police? Where is the military? Where are the tens of thousands of settlers who ought to say that these horrifying hilltop youths are criminals who should be sent to prison rather than wandering around olive orchards belonging to West Bank residents?Nor is it possible to ignore what has been happening in some Israeli military units, including special forces, where the best and most daring soldiers serve. There have been too many incidents of cruel shooting at civilians, of destruction of property and homes, even when this should not happen.There is too much looting and theft from homes, about which in many cases Israeli soldiers have boasted. Some have gone as far as posting about their antics online.Israelis are committing war crimes. I do not share the opinion of former chief of staff Moshe Yaalon, who said that Israel is carrying out ethnic cleansing. But we are nearing the point when it will be undeniable that such is the unavoidable result of what the government, the military and our brave soldiers have been doing in practice.It is time to halt, before we are all banished from the family of nations and are summoned to theinternational criminal courtfor war crimes, with no good defense.Enough is enough.Ehud Olmert is a former prime minister of IsraelThis op-ed originally appeared inHaaretzExplore more on these topicsIsraelOpinionInternational criminal courtInternational criminal justiceGazaWest BankPalestinian territoriesIsrael-Gaza warcommentShareReuse this content"

But he understands something Keir Starmer doesn’tJonathan FreedlandThe shadow justice secretary is eyeing Kemi Badenoch’s job – but he’s released a video that highlights a weakness in our technocratic PMFri 30 May 2025 12.42 EDTLast modified on Fri 30 May 2025 13.42 EDTShareThere is no shortage of reasons to dislike and dismiss Robert Jenrick. He is, after all, the former immigration minister who ordered that a centre for unaccompanied child asylum-seekers paint over itsmurals of cartoon characters, lest the child refugees got the wrong idea and thought they were being welcomed and had at last reached a place of safety.We certainly wouldn’t want to take lectures on law-breaking from Jenrick, given that the former housing secretaryacted unlawfullyin rushing through approval for a development by the Conservative donor Richard Desmond, thereby saving the onetime porn publisher more than £40m. Nor would he be our go-to guy on matters of ripping off the public, not after it was revealed in 2020 that heclaimed £100,000 in expensesfor athirdhome. To say nothing of his service in a Boris Johnson administration that happily funnelled at least£1bn of taxpayers’ moneyto assorted chancers lucky enough to have a friend in government, thereby securing for themselves a place in the VIP lane when it came to bidding for lucrative contracts making personal protective equipment or PPE.All of that makes it tempting to wave aside Jenrick’s latest stunt, avideo of himself challenging fare dodgersat a London Underground station, calling them “mate” and demanding that they go back and pay for their journey. The transparency of his motive only strengthens that impulse. He wants Kemi Badenoch’s job: we know that, because he tried to get it last time, when she defeated him.What’s more, his pitch is that he will be the Tory leader who outflanks Reform UK on the right, nullifying that party’s threat by offering voters the same brew of nationalist populism they can get from Nigel Farage. That’s why he speaks so often, and so unbendingly, on immigration and why he includes an unexpected item in the list of menaces with which he closes the fare-dodging video: “It’s the same with bike theft, phone theft, tool theft, shoplifting, drugs in town centres, weird Turkish barber shops. It’s all chipping away at society.”Weird Turkish barber shops. It leaps out, because it’s the only thing in that list that isn’t a crime. Ah, comes the response, but many of those places are suspected fronts for criminal activity, specifically money laundering. OK, but the same suspicion hovers over the “American candy” stores that are similarly proliferating on the high street; why didn’t Jenrick mention them? Could it be that “American” doesn’t quite have the same bite as “Turkish”? Jenrick is an extremely online politician, one who will be familiar with the“Yookay” meme, which suggests a Britain gone to the dogs: shabby, scuzzy, lawless and threatening – and that often likes toillustrate this descent into antisocial malaisewith pictures of young Black and brown men. The “Turkish” reference fits that narrative quite nicely.1:05Robert Jenrick confronts fare dodgers in London Tube stations – videoSo there are good reasons for anti-racists and progressives to dismiss Jenrick and this latest bit of agitprop, seeing it as a cynical play either for Badenoch’s job or, perhaps, Sadiq Khan’s, given that the explicit target of the video is the London mayor. And yet, it would be unwise to do that too hastily. There is a lesson here for liberals, the Labour government and all those who want to see nationalist populism defeated.Because Jenrick is on to something here. Toxic messenger though he might be, his message will land. Put simply, people despise, with vehemence, what would officially be classified as petty crime and antisocial behaviour. Listen to those who have agreed with Jenrick on this latest point, including mothers speaking of pushing toddlers in buggies, only to be shoved aside by fare-dodgers seizing on the chance to slip through an open gate.But it goes deeper than physical intimidation. The resentment resides in the sense of unfairness: you paid, so why shouldn’t they? You put out all your bins, so why should someone else get away with dumping rubbish on the street? The anger this generates is not solely about what they’ve not done, but about what youhavedone.Crimeor antisocial conduct of this kind makes you feel as if you’ve been a mug, a sucker, for obeying the rules.That sentiment corrodes the rule of law and is politically poisonous, as Jenrick should know. He is out of government partly because of it. The anger at Johnson originated in his breaking of lockdown rules, but the depth of that anger was because he had, in the process, made so many feel foolish for having kept them. It is that fury which Jenrick is tapping into. “But everyone else has to pay,” he says to one fare dodger, and it’s the heart of the matter.Some of the hostile responses Jenrick has generated have upbraided him for making so much about a few quid here or there, when much greater larcenies are being committed. It’s quite true that it would take many decades of committed barrier-jumping by today’s fare-dodgers to steal a sum close to the £15.3bn fortune taken from taxpayers’ pockets in Covid contracts deemed to “carry a high risk of corruption”. But that’s to skip past human psychology. We react to the crime we can see in front of us with more intensity than to one distant and abstract. Besides, there is at least a criminological argument, popularised as “broken windows theory”, to the view that if you deal swiftly with small crimes, you deter criminals from committing larger ones.The narrow lessonKeir Starmermight take from this is that he needs to act soon on fare evasion and the like. The broader, more pertinent one would be about politics itself. Sometimes politicians are at their most effective when they don’t pass a law or spend money, but simply give voice to voters’ anxieties. Donald Trump does it even now, acting as a commentator on patterns and trends in US society as if he were a pundit rather than the president. Farage does it all the time; Tony Blair used to do it, even from Downing Street.The current PM’s technocratic instinct is to say nothing about a problem unless he has a plan or policy to fix it. But sometimes it’s effective just to make an argument from the “bully pulpit” you have as head of government. That’s what leaders, as opposed to managers, do. It’s a way of signalling to voters who you are, what you believe and, most important, whose side you’re on.Starmer would be wise to do it more. It might mean a nod to the right, calling, say, for the return of a sense of shame to those guilty of selfish, antisocial behaviour, or a nod to the left, publicly naming and shaming, say,the water bosseswho have been similarly selfish and antisocial by taking gargantuan bonuses even as they beg for bailouts.Awkward, I admit, to have to take lessons in politics from the likes ofRobert Jenrick. But this one is useful. And, best of all, Starmer didn’t even have to pay for it.Jonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Now I’ve directed a TV series about herAli NaushahiI soaked up her sharp insights into class, gender and power. Reading more about her life, the parallels between us became clearFri 30 May 2025 09.38 EDTLast modified on Fri 30 May 2025 21.30 EDTShareIgrew up as the daughter of an imam in a conservative British-Pakistani community inBradford. Our early years were spent in a large Victorian terrace owned by the local mosque council. When my father was replaced, we downsized overnight to a much smaller house on the other side of town. The loss of a beloved home, close friends and community was a deeply disorienting experience.Decades later, directing the new BBC seriesJane Austen: Rise of a Genius, I found myself thinking back to that time. On the surface, my life and Jane Austen’s couldn’t be more different – an English novelist born in the 18th century and a working-class British-Pakistani woman. Austen’s novels had always resonated with me when I read them as a girl. But learning moreabout her life as part of my director’s prep, I realised just how many shared realities we had. I saw how similar Austen’s family dynamics were to my own a couple of centuries down the line. When Austen’s father stepped away from his post as a clergyman, it forced the family to leave their genteel rectory home for a series of ever more insecure living quarters. Though separated by culture, time and geography, like Austen I understood early the brutality of economics and just how vulnerable a family can become when its financial foundation is shaken.Devouring Austen’s work as a teenager, I appreciated not just the storytelling but the survival tactics – strategies women used to maintain their dignity in a world that offered them very little agency. Growing up as a young woman from a Muslim background, I sometimes lived in the shadows, within the quiet restrictions and expectations of duty. I wanted to scream my rage into the abyss as I gingerly walked a tightrope between obedience and self-determination.Reading those novels, it wasn’t the ballrooms and the bonnets that spoke to me, but the stakes. They captured the emotional cost of a world in which women had limited options and where marriage was more often an economic contract than a love story. This was something I had seen first-hand in many of thearranged marriages of the women around me.Though my father, like Austen’s, passionately advocated for women’s education, in our wider community education for girls was not widely encouraged. Teachers in my inner-city school were predominantly white, middle class and from posher postcodes. They assumed that as young Pakistani girls we would disappear into early marriages, and some didn’t bother to hide their low expectations. That condescension stung. It made me hungry to prove them wrong, and to challenge whenever I could.Austen taught me that the domestic sphere could be radical. Her characters weren’t obvious revolutionaries, but women who, through wit, tenacity and endurance, reshaped their own lives. My grandmother, widowed early, chose not to remarry, thereby ensuring her autonomy. It was a rare and courageous decision in her 1960s rural Kashmiri village. The memory of my grandmother’s bold and brilliant choice lies in the very fabric of my DNA. Austen’s cousin Eliza was also a woman who instinctively understood the power her widowhood afforded her to live by her own rules. It was an important lesson in how an intelligent woman with her wits about her could cleverly navigate and confound societal expectations. A lesson not lost on a youngJane Austen.Like Austen, I too have a large brood of siblings, and our home was noisy and full of stories. We couldn’t afford expensive outings, but my father’s bookcases groaned under the weight of his book collection: dusty encyclopedias, Islamic jurisprudence and Urdu translations of Rumi. I knew books were the portal to other worlds, other possibilities, and Iread everything.Storytelling became an early refuge. I made my siblings act in hastily put together skits, all filmed on a clunky VHS recorder my parents could hardly afford, but which, like Austen’s writing desk, was a crucial gift. Even then I was crafting scenes, directing chaos into meaning.Coming back to Austen’s work as a film-maker, I saw what I hadn’t as a teenager: the sharpness of her observations, her critiques of social climbing and conformity, the feminist undertones, the devastating awareness of how class, gender and power intertwine. As I dug deeper into Austen’s life, I began to understand more why her work had struck such a chord with me as a teenager. While she wrote about women with seemingly limited options, it was always with a great deal of wry wit and a sense of hopefulness. I found inspiration in Austen’s humour, and to this day my sisters and I still refer to our mum as Mrs Bennet in a nod to her impassioned pleas for us not to dismiss potential suitors.Most importantly, Austen left behind stories of female protagonists struggling with daily compromises to survive that still resonate with women today. The idea that it is possible to live truthfully. In Persuasion, Anne Elliot finds the strength to choose for herself after years of silence. That journey hit close to home. I didn’t follow the expected path. I delayed marriage. I pursued education and entered a competitive, creative field where people like me were rarely seen. Telling Austen’s story has felt deeply personal. It is a reclamation of the girl who once sat in her bedroom window reading Emma while the sound of Friday prayers echoed in the background. A tribute to her voice and my own hard-fought one.Austen’s power, quiet but enduring, transcends time and cultural identity. Marking her 250th birthday isn’t just about remembering a literary icon, but about recognising that across the centuries, some battles remain the same. And if that’s not something a girl from Bradford can relate to, I don’t know what is.Ali Naushahi is a TV director and writerDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Kindness in person and conspiracies onlineLiam ThorpAfter celebration turned to chaos, Liverpudlians stepped in to help those in need – while the usual suspects spread liesFri 30 May 2025 05.21 EDTLast modified on Fri 30 May 2025 05.26 EDTShare“This doesn’t sound good at all.” The message flashed up on a group chat I am in with other journalists inLiverpooland Merseyside. My blood cooled instantly upon reading it. I have heard those words before and I know what they mean. They mean something has happened. Something big and something bad. It wasn’t long before we all started to realise quite how big and quite how bad.After a day of joyous celebration that turned Liverpool into a sea of brilliant red, hundreds of fans were heading back into the city when they looked up to see an ambulance moving through a temporarily pedestrianised route on its way to help a stricken individual. The fans, anxious to assist, moved to the side, when aFord Galaxy suddenly emergedfrom behind it and in a few terrible moments, turned elation and harmony into chaos and pain.At a time when social media is such an unreliable and often malicious source of information, we had to try to verify exactly what had happened in Water Street and the truly grim clips that emerged made us all fear the absolute worst.I am still amazed and relieved that no lives were lost. The news that those who were hospitalised are said to be stable and recovering well is something everyone in this city and beyond will continue to treasure.And we are also grateful for the many stories of kindness, generosity and that well-known scouse solidarity that have offered rays of sunshine to combat the dark cloud that Monday evening’s events have left hanging over this unique and vibrant place. On Thursday, Paul Doyle, a 53-year-old man from Liverpool, was charged with multiple offences in connection with the attack and will make his first court appearance on Friday.Those qualities of solidarity so in evidence this week will continue to be needed. I’m talking about the dozens of Liverpool pubs that kept their doors open late into the night as people left stranded and separated from loved ones tried to figure out their plans amid the chaos. I’m talking about the cabbies and car owners who flooded social media with offers of free lifts.I’m talking about Kerrie and John Davies from Wallasey, who – along with staff from their travel company – ran continual free shuttle buses to help more than 400 people get home from Liverpool city centre. And I’mtalking about Ellis Matthews, whose dad was hit by the car as it ploughed along Water Street and who chased after it with many others, bravely putting their own lives at risk as they fought to stop the driver from injuring anyone else.There are many, many more examples that show how the people of this city and this region did what they always do: step up when people need them the most. A glance at social media on that frantic night showed the best of humanity – as offers of help poured in – but of course it showed the very worst as well. It wasn’t long before a grim parade of bad faith actors were springing gleefully on to the trauma of what those in Water Street had faced, desperate to stir up hatred, division and chaos in the name of whatever malevolent cause they currently subscribe to.Our region knows just how dangerous such actions can be. We sawwhat happened after Southport. We know the pivotal role that poisonous misinformation played in bringing that hell to our streets. Merseyside police officers were among the first to arrive at those unspeakable scenes in Southport last summer, and some of the same officers found themselves being attacked by bricks from an angry, misinformed mob the next night.It is clear that the force was desperate to avoid such turmoil after Monday’s incident in Water Street, and the decision toquickly release the factthat the only suspect was a white British man from Liverpool and that the incident was not being treated as terrorism was entirely understandable and – because of that painful context – the correct one.View image in fullscreenTrouble flares during a protest in Southport, after three children died and eight were injured at a dance school, July 2024.Photograph: Richard McCarthy/PABut it won’t be enough for some. There are many operating in the hellscape of social media today who will never be content with any explanation that doesn’t fit their narrative. There are still plenty who are continuing to plaster all kinds of bizarre and unfounded conspiracies across social media in an increasingly desperate bid for validation and engagement – without a second thought for those who are continuing to recover.As journalists all we can do to counter this rising torrent of online bile is to report the facts as and when we get them – and only when we know them to be true. We have to hope that the quiet majority will turn to trusted sources at times of uncertainty and trauma.One fact we absolutely know to be true is that Liverpool is a resilient city. This is a place with a spirit of mind, character and solidarity forged through the collective painful experiences of Hillsborough, of Thatcher, of austerity. It is a place that has picked itself up off the canvas time and time again – and has done so with extra resolve, with even more fortitude, with another big helping of togetherness.That powerful concoction will be badly needed as Liverpool comes to terms with a day of celebration that turned into a night of devastation. But if any city can come together and recover again, we know it is the beautiful one that lies on the banks of the River Mersey.The fee for this article will be donated to the fundraiser set up for the victims of Monday’s incident in LiverpoolLiam Thorp is political editor at the Liverpool EchoDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

But the chaos is also, as it was for Boris Johnson, a means of defence.Since he makes zero pretence of professionalism, it’s somehow less expected of him, enabling him to slip past the standards applied to others. Rival parties often avoid attacking him, for fear of reminding voters he exists. Even now Reform UK hasopened a substantial poll leadover Labour, treating this ramshackle outfit as a potential party of government still feels faintly ridiculous. Prime Minister Farage? Are youserious? But he is. And it’s time the country was too.The Farage whoparked his tankson Labour’s lawn this week, promising to scrap the two-child limit on some benefits and restore pensioners’ winter fuel payment, was familiar in many ways yet somehow sharper round the edges. Imagine a picture, clicking into focus. His critique of a prime minister lacking “any great feeling, meaning or passion for the job” was laser-targeted on Labour supporters increasingly confused about what Keir Starmer actually stands for. No wonder Starmer wasstung into responding, denouncing his wildly unfunded promises of free money as “Liz Truss all over again”. But they won’t really mind that at Reform HQ: to be attacked that directly helps entrench the idea that their tiny motley crew, not the Tories, is the opposition now.Farage is by far the most experienced party leader in British politics, and not coincidentally the boldest. He doesn’t need focus groups to tell him what “his” people think – he knows exactly who they are, what they want, who they hate – and the long slow march to Brexit taught him that over time they can warm to ideas they’d once have rejected. So where Labour seems to live anxiously within the limits of what the public will currently accept, he’s one step ahead, thinking about how far they could be persuaded to go.When Starmer hesitated over scrapping a two-child cap that remains popular with the public, Farage didn’t. Since he’s not in government, the £3.5bn price tag isn’t his problem, and by embracing the idea he can take the credit with parents if it happens while leaving Labour to foot the bill. Meanwhile he’s gambling that Reform voters would trade a bigger welfare bill for the prospect of families being encouraged to have more children, thus reducing the need for immigration. You can loathe everything about that logic and still wonder why Labour can’t seem to find popular (though in a more benign sense) ways to sell contentious ideas. Might it ultimately take a dash of leftwing populism to beat the rightwing kind? (Apparently, in focus groups the one left politician who seemingly excites Reform voters is Bernie Sanders, raging against an economy he considers rigged against the working classes.)But for all its strengths, that Farage speech also exposed the weaknesses of a party on an impossibly steep learning curve. Reform’s predecessors were one-issue parties, designed to force bigger parties to act but not to run things themselves. There is a vast chasm between that and providing a full-spectrum opposition-into-government service via just five novice MPs and a back office operation with no real policy expertise.He’ll make mistakes, get things wrong. In Tuesday’s speech, the normally blokeish Farage pitched hard for conservative women’s votes, talking about ways of making life easier for new parents. But vague, old-fashioned musings about creches in the workplace are a giveaway that he isn’t talking to anyone who actually understands how modern childcare works, and Reform is similarly vague about a vast swathe of issues on which a credible opposition needs to know its onions.Look atits manifesto. No, really: look at it, because it was apparently written on the assumption nobody would. Their 2029 prospectus will surely be slicker, but for now this document drafted on the back of a metaphorical fag packet for the 2024 snap election is Reform’s only available vision for government.Obviously the maths is bonkers: a staggering £90bn of tax cuts, theInstitute for Fiscal Studies reckoned– abolishing inheritance tax, slashing business taxes, “simplifying” others – plus £50bn of extra spending, implausibly funded by binning net zero (though that’s mainly private sector investment, not taxpayers’ money), abolishing “waste” and various other cuts that don’t add up. Liz Truss again, but on steroids.The rest is a combination of wildly sweeping promises – completely eradicating NHS waiting lists for the first time in the NHS’s history, or simply returning all small boat arrivals to France with no obvious thought for how the French might respond – and weirdly specific micro-policies, including a public inquiry on vaccine harms presumably added to mollify anti-vaxxers, and a bizarre rule that any school lesson on British or European slavery be matched with one on non-European use of slavery.As the former Conservative special adviser Sam Freedmanpoints outon hisSubstack, it also implies a government worryingly averse to challenge. Reform would scrap the BBC licence fee, essentially killing public service broadcasting; politicise senior civil service appointments; and leave the European convention on human rights. Few checks and balances would survive a Prime Minister Farage, and the hard lesson from across the Atlantic is that constitutional experts should be thinking urgently now about how to pre-emptively shore them up.If Trump voters are any guide, many Farage voters are past caring about any of that. They already assume most politicians lie, so they don’t really expect his promises to stack up, and they’re strongly motivated to punish other parties they think have failed them. It’s progressive voters who are potentially most sensitive to messages about the risks of Prime Minister Farage, judging byYouGov’s findingthat given a choice between the Reform leader and either Starmer, Ed Davey or Kemi Badenoch, Anyone-but-Farage enters Downing Street every time. Beloved by his own supporters but uniting everyone else’s against him, for now Farage looks more Marine Le Pen than Donald Trump, a populist kept at bay by mass tactical voting for as long as progressives can bury their differences.But it’s an uncomfortable way to run a democracy: like a political equivalent of lockdown, it’s a means of temporarily quarantining populism rather than a cure, and if maintained for too long it ultimately risks an explosion. Things don’t get more serious than that.Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsNigel FarageOpinionReform UKcommentShareReuse this content"

What has caused this long and slow awakening? Is it Israel’s killing of more than 54,000 Palestinians since Hamas’s horrific attack on 7 October 2023? Thousands of babiesat risk of dyingfrom starvation and malnutrition? Civiliansburning alive? Israeli ministers’ plans to reoccupy and recolonise the Gaza Strip,expelling Palestinians? Or perhaps it’s the Israeli armyfiring shots at diplomats, including Europeans, in the West Bank – or theracist chanting, during a state-funded march in Jerusalem, of “death to the Arabs” and “may their villages burn”?It’s probably a combination of all the above, as well as the recognition that principled pressure on Israel will certainly not come from Washington. Whatever the triggers for it,Europemay be nearing an inflection point on the graph, turning the dark page of its complicity with Israel’s nearly 20-month war in Gaza.A minority of European countries has made a principled stand over the war. EU members Spain, Ireland and Slovenia, as well as Norway outside the bloc, recognised Palestine as a sovereign state last year, fully supported the proceedings and decisions of the international court of justice and the international criminal court, continued funding Unrwa, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, and voted in favour of all UN general assembly resolutions on Gaza.However, there is also a minority of countries that has continued to offer unabashed support for Benjamin Netanyahu’s government. The most unrepentant are the Czech Republic and Hungary, with Germany and Italy next in line. Hungary’s prime minister, Viktor Orbán, went as far asinvitingNetanyahu to Budapest, despite the international criminal court’s arrest warrant. Hungary thenleft the ICCaltogether.Most other European countries have sat silently in the middle. For the first six months of the war, this meant refusing to call for a ceasefire. Only in the spring of 2024, when even Joe Biden’s rabidly pro-Israel administrationchanged tack, did the EU join the chorus in favour of a truce.European governments and EU institutions have mildly pushed back against Donald Trump’s monstrousGaza “riviera” proposaland embraced theArab recovery and reconstruction plan. But they have continued to cooperate with Israel, going as far as holding an EU-Israel Association Council meeting in February that was chaired by the EU high representative, Kaja Kallas, and the Israeli foreign minister, Gideon Sa’ar. At most, they have lightly slapped Israel on the wrist for its disproportionate and indiscriminate violence in the strip.Now, though, the silent majority is shifting. The UK hassuspended negotiationson a bilateral free trade agreement with Israel. Pausing that negotiation inflicts no cost on Israel, since no agreement yet exists. But it’s symbolically important.France is louder and more active, not simply in its diplomatic pursuit of a two-state solution, but also in hinting at the possibility oftargeted sanctionson Israel. So far, these are baby steps, mostly abstract and/or tentative. But they indicate a change of pace and heart.Potentially most meaningful is the move within the EU tosuspend its preferential trade arrangementswith Israel under the EU-Israel association agreement. To be clear, suspending preferential trade would not constitute a sanction. Sanctions, implying import bans or restrictions, require unanimous agreement in the EU, and it’s hard to imagine all 27 EU governments ever agreeing to that. Suspension of the entire EU-Israel association agreement is also hard to imagine, since this would also require unanimity.But suspending preferential trade means withholding a benefit of theassociation agreement and this falls within the remit of EU trade policy, which only requires a qualified majority of EU states voting in favour.Trade between the EU and Israel would continue,just not on preferential terms as has been the case since the association agreement came into force in 2000.While considered unthinkable in the past, there is now a real possibility that this process could move forward. For the time being, Kallas has mandated a review of Israel’s compliance with its obligations under the association agreement. Interestingly, the review was formally requested not by a pro-Palestinian member state such as Spain or Ireland, or even by France, butby a traditionally pro-Israel one, the Netherlands, led by a rightwing government.Considering that human rights and respect for international law are legally “essential elements” of the EU-Israel agreement (article 2), it would be egregious if the review, which will report on Israel’s documented war crimes, were ignored and did not trigger a proposal by the European Commission for a suspension.The qualified majority necessary to suspend the trade section of the agreement would require15 out of 27 statesto support the move. Seventeen countries backed the review. But a qualified majority also requires the agreement of member states representing 65% of the EU population. If Germany and Italy opposed the move, that population threshold would not be met. Either one or the other wouldneed to budge.At the moment, Italy’s far-right government, led by Giorgia Meloni, has given no indication of a change of policy. Criticism of Israel is growing, but not to the point of triggering a policy shift.German governments have long regarded Israel’s security as aStaatsräsonfor Germany given its history. This means it is near impossible to criticise Israel’s war in Gaza. But opinions about that may finally be shifting. The chancellor, Friedrich Merz, declared this week that Israel’s actions in Gaza couldno longer be justified– and that he could no longer understand Israel’s goals in the strip.Actually, Israel’s goals have been made abundantly clear, by the words of the Israeli government and, even more so, by its deeds. This is a war that has much to do with reoccupation, recolonisation and mass expulsion, and very little to do with Israeli security and the release of hostages. Even the staunchest of Israel’s supporters, such as Merz, are becoming hard-pressed to deny this, and therefore less able to condone and support it.The suspension of the EU-Israel association agreement’s preferential trade provisions may not stop the war in Gaza overnight. But it would be the first concrete step by the international community to exact a price on Israel for its crimes. Ultimately, imposing such costs is the only way to bring about change.The EU is Israel’sbiggest trading partner, so the cost in question is not insignificant. Acting now will not bring back tens of thousands of lives in the Gaza Strip. These will remain for ever a stain on our collective conscience. But it would reduce the bleak prospect of a future with only more death and destruction in store.Nathalie Tocci is a Guardian Europe columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

While welcome, his rhetoric calling this an “outrage”, “unacceptable” and “untenable” feels inadequate in the face of what looks like a genocide unfolding in full view of the world.These words have not been matched with any new “concrete action” of the kind being called for by what feels like just about everyone, and foreshadowed by three of Australia’s closest allies,the UK, France and Canada.The prime minister hasn’t been able to offer a satisfactory explanation as to why Australia wasn’t a signatory to this stronger statement of intent, choosing to move away from the mantle of middle power leader we’ve worn so proudly in times past.Australia has a proud history of standing up against human catastrophe. Gaza should be no exception | Ed HusicRead moreThe time for stronger global action is now. For too long the international community has failed to follow up words of condemnation with action. Palestinian people have been killed in their tens of thousands, two million teeter on the brink of starvation and the Israeli governmentcontinues to build new settlementsin the West Bank.

He came with a message of hope and compassion. He read a statement from the family of an Israeli hostage, condemned the attacks of October 7 and articulated the simple truth that “killing women and children is wrong, no matter if it’s Palestinian children and women or Israeli”.View image in fullscreenDr Mohammed Mustafa at Parliament House in Canberra on Tuesday. The emergency physician has completed two rotations on the ground in Gaza.Photograph: Lukas Coch/AAPDr Mo also lay down the challenge to the Australian government to step up and help fund a deployable children’s hospital, and to engage diplomatically with Israel to facilitate its entry toGaza. Rebuking the prime minister’s assertion that Australia wasn’t a “major player” in the Middle East, he said: “You don’t have to be a major player to feed children. You don’t have to be a major player to heal children. We need healers in the Middle East, and Australia can be the healer. It can lead the world.”As Dr Mo spoke I was reminded of one of my heroes, Desmond Tutu. He was constantly urging people to recognise our shared humanity and that “if you are neutral in times of injustice, you have chosen the side of the oppressor”. This is indeed a time to focus on our shared humanity. And the fact that Jewish people are not Prime Minister Netanyahu, Gazans are not Hamas. Here in Australia we must come together, not turn our frustrations on our fellow Australians. Dr Mo can serve as an example to us all. After what he’s seen, he has every right to rage, but chooses instead to see the pain of everyone affected by these horrors.Is the Australian government doing enough on Gaza? | Fiona KatauskasRead moreDr Mo was one of the first to start what he calls “Doctor diaries”, sending content from inside Nasser hospital at great personal risk in a bid to focus global attention on Gaza. It’s something we’ve seen others continue.Everyone knows we cannot end the war alone, but we do have an important role to play as a middle power that believes in an international rules-based order.In June last year I called on the Albanese government toconsider targeted sanctionsagainst members of the Israeli government and the Israeli Defense Forces. Almost 12 months and tens of thousands more deaths later, those callscontinue to grow, including fromwithin Labor’s own ranks.We should have a consistent, values-based approach to how we respond to war and disasters and how we use our humanitarian program. This includes providing an equitable amount of aid and assistance based on need, not politics. Alongside this Australia must stop exporting weapons or parts of weapons that could be used to kill and injure civilians, and start providing emergency visas to the family members of Australians.If the horror unfolding in Gaza is not our country’s red line for stronger action then I don’t know what is.David Pocock is an independent senator in the ACTExplore more on these topicsAustralian foreign policyOpinionIsrael-Gaza warHuman rightsAustralian politicsGazaMiddle East and north AfricacommentShareReuse this content"

All of the music I’ve ever made … now belongs … to me.”She originallylost the rights in 2019when her first record label, Big Machine, sold them to music executive Scooter Braun. Swift described the sale to Braun as her “worst case scenario”, and said she had not been given the opportunity to buy her work outright, but to “earn” one album back for each new album she recorded for the label. Her subsequent albums, from 2019’s Lover onwards, were released on Republic, with Swift retaining the rights to the master recordings.Braun at one time managed Kanye West, who repeatedly targeted Swift after he infamouslyinvaded her acceptance speechat the 2009 VMA awards. In November 2020, Braun sold the master recordings to the private equity firm Shamrock Capital in November for a reported $300m.In a letter to fans posted today, Swift said that she bought her masters – as well as her videos, concert films, album art and photography and unreleased songs – back from Shamrock. The Guardian understands that previous rumours that it cost Swift between $600m and $1bn are inaccurately high.As was customary for record deals at the time, Swift’s arrangement with Big Machine meant that they owned her master recordings, hence she did not own them at the point of sale. In her letter, she wrote: “All I’ve ever wanted was the opportunity to work hard enough to be able to one day purchase my music outright with no strings attached, no partnership, with full autonomy.“I will be forever grateful to everyone at Shamrock Capital for being the first people to ever offer this to me. The way they’ve handled every interaction we’ve had has been honest, fair and respectful. This was a business deal to them, but I really felt like they saw it for what it was to me: my memories and my sweat and my handwriting and my decades of dreams. I am endlessly thankful. My first tattoo might just be a huge shamrock in the middle of my forehead.”Swift credited the support of her fans with enabling her to buy back her music. “I can’t thank you enough for helping to reunite me with this art that I have dedicated my life to, but have never owned until now.”In order to regain control over her catalogue after the original sale to Braun – and to devalue his investment – Swift embarked on a project to rerecord all six albums, branding each one “(Taylor’s Version)” and adding “From the Vault” tracks from the original songwriting sessions that hadn’t made it on to the original albums.Between 2021 and 2023, Swift rerecorded her albumsFearless(originally released in 2008),Red(2012),Speak Now(2010) and1989(2014).As the principal songwriter, she has the right to rerecord the material and to block any use of the original recordings. Several rerecorded songs made their debuts in film and TV syncs: last week, the new version of Look What You Made Me Do – from the as-yet unreleased rerecording of 2017’s Reputation – appeared in the new series of The Handmaid’s Tale.Reputation and Swift’s self-titled debut album, from 2006, are the only albums not to be rerecorded. Fans have been speculating as to their possible release dates for years, leaping on the colours of her outfits and what they perceive to be clues in her limited social media posts to deduce when they would appear.Now that Swift has reacquired her master recordings, there is less reason to proceed with the rerecordings.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSleeve NotesFree weekly newsletterGet music news, bold reviews and unexpected extras.

What about Rep TV?” she wrote, calling the record by its fan nickname. “Full transparency: I haven’t even rerecorded a quarter of it. The Reputation album was so specific to that time in my life, and I kept hitting a stopping point when I tried to remake it.”Reputation – which Swift recently called a “goth-punk moment of female rage at being gaslit by an entire social structure” – was born of a time when her public image had tanked in the wake of a feud with Kanye West and accusations of overexposure.“All that defiance, that longing to be understood while feeling purposely misunderstood, that desperate hope, that shame-born snarl and mischief. To be perfectly honest, it’s the one album in those first six that I thought couldn’t be improved upon by redoing it. Not the music, or photos, or videos. So I kept putting it off.”Swift told fans that they might yet hear the unreleased Reputation From the Vault tracks, “if you’re into the idea”. She confirmed that she had rerecorded her debut. “I really love how it sounds now. Those two albums can still have their moments to re-emerge when the time is right, if that would be something you guys would be excited about. But if it happens, it won’t be from a place of sadness and longing for what I wish I could have. It will just be a celebration now.”One suspects she will release the records, or what exists of them: the essential redundancy of the project is unlikely to thwart its potentially vast commercial impact. The four previously released rerecordings broke commercial and chart records for Swift: in the UK alone, 1989 (Taylor’s Version) clocked higher first-week combined streams and sales – 184,000 – than the original total of 90,000 a decade earlier.Taylor-made deals: how artists are following Swift’s rights exampleRead moreThe rerecordings were interspersed with a run of new, original recordings. Swift has released four albums since 2020: her lockdown sister records Folklore and Evermore (2020), as well as Midnights (2022) andThe Tortured Poets Department(2024).Swift’s monumentally successful catalogue was showcased on her Eras tour, which travelled the world between 2023 and 2024, became the first ever billion dollar-grossing tour, and eventually grossed more than $2bn in total. The show was divided into album-specific segments, andupdated when it hit Europein 2024 to include a new Tortured Poets section.Swift concluded her letter by referencing the industry-wide conversations about artist rights that her saga had kickstarted. These days, it is far more common, particularly for young female artists, to own their masters than it was for the teenage Swift in 2006.“Every time a new artist tells me they negotiated to own their master recordings in their record contract because of this fight, I’m reminded of how important it was for all of this to happen. Thank you for being curious about something that used to be thought of as too industry-centric for broad discussion. You’ll never know how much it means to me that you cared. Every single bit of it counted and ended us up here.”Explore more on these topicsTaylor SwiftPop and rockMusic industrynewsShareReuse this content"

The scale and feel of it were unlike anything else. Complete escapism. I used to skate around the living room singing the songs.Andrzej Goulding (video designer and animator):It’s such a part of popular culture – Starlight Express is even referenced on Family Guy. But I didn’t know a huge amount about the musical aside from the fact that it was on roller-skates and it was trains.Tim Hatley (set designer):I was studying at Central Saint Martins in the 80s and went to see Starlight because its designer, John Napier, was coming in to do a project with us. We’d been doing Shakespeare but this was almost like a fairground ride. I mean, they high-fived the audience – some of whom had seen the show 50 times.Gabriella Slade (costume designer):People who saw Starlight when they were kids are now bringing their own families. In our audience you can be up close with some of these characters and costumes. That’s quite rare.View image in fullscreenNancy Wood (Buffy), Stephanie Lawrence (Pearl), Jeff Shankley (Greaseball), Frances Ruffelle (Dinah) and Chrissy Wickham (Ashley) in the original 1984 production of Starlight Express at the Apollo Victoria theatre, London.Photograph: Donald Cooper/AlamyTim Hatley:For those who saw it the first time round, we wanted to give it a different spin. With a flexible space like this, the world is your oyster. Do it in the round? Have it like a tennis court? We had lots of thoughts and lots of models. Everybody’s waiting on me to come up with the concept. Lighting, video, even skating and choreography – they can’t get on with their work until they know where the slopes are and how steep they are and where the video wall is.Gabriella Slade:The original Starlight is probably one of the most iconic shows of all time. From a design point of view, it’s just heaven. On a revival it’s important, I think, to reference what has been before to a degree – we wanted to continue that spirit but also, 40 years on, shape it for a new generation.Tim Hatley:We didn’t want to just copy what John had done before. And we didn’t want to be stuck with real trains running through tunnels and over bridges.Gabriella Slade:The brief is really tricky! In our early conversations, we talked about the core components of a train and how to present those in a costume for performers who need to be able to move as easily as possible and to fall safely. There was a lot of aerodynamic chat!View image in fullscreenJeevan Braich as Rusty and Kayna Montecillo as Pearl in Starlight Express.Photograph: Pamela RaithAndrzej Goulding:As soon as we landed on the idea of train tracks through space, where we’re sat as an audience became the race planet. There are other planets out there, like Electra’s and Greaseball’s. There’s no direction of that in the script. It’s completely left up to the team. References can come from anywhere but there’s that amazing 80s advert for Milky Way with the red car and the blue car where they’re kind of floating through the air. It’s that kind of world.Tim Hatley:With video gaming, what kids are used to now is very different to playing with the old Hornby train sets.Andrzej Goulding:I had a train set as a kid, one of those little wooden ones. You pretend they’re anything. Starlight was like mixing Mario Kart with trains and setting it in space. The reason you can go over the top is it’s the point of view of a child. Having the kid, Control, on stage is a bit of a masterstroke – you can do even more because they’re directing what happens. We’d often ask: What would a kid do in this situation?Gabriella Slade:We’re in a child’s bedroom – Control’s outfit had to look like it had been made at home or bought, or a hybrid of the two. The jumpsuit vibe felt right – a bit cosmic.Howard Hudson:We had to keep the childlike essence of the piece – this is a child’s imagination – while using such ultra-modern technology. So there are moments that are incredibly simple, like a single star flying in.Tim Hatley:There were three separate designs: auditorium, front of house and the show. As a theatre designer, you’re not usually governing where the audience are going to sit – or worried about where they are going to be coming in and out. With this, it was a priority.Gabriella Slade:First off, you read the script, listen to the music and collate research images. From there, you form sketches or initial shapes and start to think about fabrics. Then you go into much more fully rendered concept sketches integrating the fabrics. That, of course, is costed and there’s a process of research and development. We had a skate school for a number of weeks so were able to access our company quite early on for fittings. Some of the shapes are not form-fitting, so we needed to make sure they would be all right going around corners in the auditorium.View image in fullscreen‘The skaters had to get used to having mega bright lights in their eyes’ … Starlight Express.Photograph: Pamela RaithTim Hatley:I’m very old fashioned. I work with model boxes. We had an enormous one for this because there were so many collaborators who weren’t necessarily in the world of theatre, but also because it was a space that didn’t really exist yet. So people needed to understand the auditorium.Howard Hudson:The skaters had to get used to having mega bright lights in their eyes as they try to navigate these routes around the space. There are more than 600 moving lights in the show, which has probably one of the biggest rigs for a musical. For the Starlight sequence in act two we have 250 of these star units that fly above the audience – each has got six LEDs on it. Then there’s however many kilometres of LED tape.Tim Hatley:We’ve got LED set into the floor and the skaters go over that. It’s not like using the old tungsten lights which got very hot, but it does warm up, which causes the plastic on top to expand. So there was a lot of development. I was able to give Howard places to put lights where you normally wouldn’t have them, like coming up through the floor. It became clear to me that it needed a rock concert feel. The songs were rearranged to have a more contemporary, poppy sound too.View image in fullscreenJade Marvin as Momma in Starlight Express.Photograph: Pamela RaithHoward Hudson:Early on, we built a pre-visualisation studio with huge screens and had a 3D version of the set on a computer. Andrzej was able to feed his content into that and we had the whole rig there. So we would watch actors rehearse a number then go into our studio and work out how to light it.Andrzej Goulding:Lighting and video are closely intertwined because there’s only so many photons you can throw on stage. Howard and I have worked together several times. The Starlight rehearsal room had a full set and the two of us sat there tracking the race, drawing a map of what goes where. The hardest thing in theatre, compared with film, is that an audience can look anywhere. Our job is to pull the attention of the observer. We used a live camera in the races to help follow the characters. And we used a leaderboard. It took us a long time just to sculpt the journey of those races.Tim Hatley:For the ramps, we talked to skaters who had been in the show before. How do we get that amount of speed up in that amount of space? Those were technical problems which were all new to me. We collaborated with a company that builds skate ramps and parks. It’s a timber surface – we’ve used some metallic paints in there too, to pick up the video. We’ve got moving scenery but where those joins are the surfaces have to be perfect and seamless. You can’t have any little gaps that might get worse during the run.Andrzej Goulding:Video design should only be there if it’s serving the story. If you’re just doing something for the sake of looking fun, it weirdly makes things slower. There’s also only so much spectacle you can do. A show is all about peaks and troughs, following the storytelling. If you’re peaking the entire time, it’s boring.View image in fullscreenAnother layer of spectacle … Tom Pigram as Electra in Starlight Express.Photograph: Pamela RaithHoward Hudson:Luke [Sheppard, the show’s director] has the most technical mind. I’m convinced he could be a lighting designer if he wanted to. We’ve collaborated for years and have developed a kind of shorthand – we started out at the Finborough and now work on these massive commercial musicals together. Set designers build models and costume designers do drawings whereas lighting is so visceral. You need to see the lights in the space, so we’re always the last people to come in. And we’re doing our job in front of 150 people in the theatre. So it’s a bit nervy.Gabriella Slade:It was important to make sure that each group of characters had a visual identity: carriages, trucks, steam engines, electric trains. They needed to feel cohesive when put together but have differentiations as well. Campbell Young and Helen Keane were our wigs and hair designers and Jackie Saundercock was our makeup designer. We had a brilliant collaborative relationship. The integration of the hair and makeup feels like one unit, which is always the aim. Each character has their own iconography, too. The designs need to be bold enough for you to identify who’s who and where they are in the races.Howard Hudson:For Electra’s song AC/DC we wanted laser units to give a quality of light you don’t get from normal fixtures. We went down to a laser company and spent a day experimenting with the looks we could get. It almost comes out of nowhere in the show and adds another layer of spectacle you don’t get out of a traditional lighting unit.View image in fullscreen‘A lovely extension of the image’ … Al Knott as Greaseball with the spark gun.Photograph: Pamela RaithGabriella Slade:The backpacks have handles, which are important for racing together. For me, the backpacks suggest a power bank or a battery – and they light up so actually have their own batteries! It’s all an extension of the actual costume. Greaseball’s spark gun creates another really lovely extension of the image. It’s got the same yellow and black scheme and that moment really fits the energy of her song.Howard Hudson:We couldn’t use traditional manual followspots because people are moving so quickly. So we use an automated system called Zactrack. Performers wear tags that send tracking data to the lighting desk, and we’re able to tell the lights which person to follow around the space.Andrzej Goulding:Video is slow. Every time we want to do something, it’s got to be rendered. We’ve got all these multiple layers. You’ve got to put in a lot of hours. I’ll sit up until three in the morning if I’m not happy with one little thing. I just want to make sure it’s right. The scale of it was enormous. I tend to work on my own but got the biggest team I’ve ever had on a show. If you surround yourself with the right people it’s fun to do. And super satisfying when everything’s working in synergy.View image in fullscreenBackstage at the Royal Albert Hall, London, for the Olivier awards where Starlight Express won best costume design.Photograph: David Levene/The GuardianHoward Hudson:Whenever I go in and see it again, I think: Crikey, how on earth did we achieve that?Tim Hatley:There’s not a bad seat in the house, and they’re all very different. I don’t think I’ve designed a show where that has been the case so much. Sitting in what we call the side tracks, looking down, you’re very close. If you’re at the back, you get the whole overview and a real sense of the video.Gabriella Slade:Some fans come in costume. It’s so lovely to have people recreate the designs. I’m never not amazed that they want to spend the time to do that.Andrzej Goulding:The craziest thing was going on to do a “normal” show afterwards – one without people on roller skates!

Now she is channelling those setbacks into a new album that’s ‘devastating, but in a fun way’Fri 30 May 2025 09.00 EDTShareRecently Shura decided she wanted to fight. Already in what she calls her Muscle Mummy era – partly inspired by the Kristen Stewart-starring, queer bodybuilding thriller Love Lies Bleeding – this buff new mindset involved the singer, songwriter and producer learning jujitsu for the video for World’s Worst Girlfriend, the soft-pop highlight of this month’s excellently titled third album, I Got Too Sad for My Friends.Things didn’t go to plan, however. In her fourth class, coming out of a roll, she felt her knee go pop. One MRI scan later, having feared a more serious ligament tear, she was diagnosed with a knee problem known as Hoffa’s fat pad impingement. It meanswe’re meeting in a cafe/record shop hybrid a few metres from the west London flat she shares with her girlfriend. She reminds me that last time we spoke, around the release of her 2016 major label debut, Nothing’s Real, she couldn’t move her neck. Being a pop artist, it seems, is bad for your health. “I played football [for Manchester City from under 11 to under 16 level], I played loads of sports and I’ve never had a serious injury – until now,” she says.Things have been emotionally painful, too. I Got Too Sad for My Friends was born out of the upside down of the pandemic, then slowly created after a severe bout of writer’s block, before being delayed by illness. But its title also encapsulates an aspect of Shura’s personality. “There’s a little sense of humour to it but, at the same time, if you examine it, it may be slightly devastating,” the 36-year-old smiles. “Devastating in a fun way.”The seeds of I Got Too Sad for My Friends’s creation started with its predecessor, Forevher, an album exploring queer love over airy 70s grooves that Shura feels didn’t get the shot it deserved. After its release in August 2019, its accompanying tour was cut short by Covid. At that time, Shura – real name Aleksandra Denton – was living in New York and too scared to leave the US in case she wasn’t allowed back in. She started to “pre-grieve” her parents back in London, specifically her mum, who is the subject of the new album’s emotional centrepiece, Online. “Worrying is my hobby,” Shura says, chewing some Nicorette gum (she’s been trying to give up vaping, which she started when she was giving up cigarettes). “I joke that if there’s something to worry about I’ll worry about it.”She searched hard for joy. When her musician friends started organising virtual concerts she figured she’d join in. She wanted to make it work, too, even rearranging the plants in her apartment for “vibes … but there were no vibes”. In the end, she gave up: “I was basically performing to a fucking fig tree.” Later, she’d find a better use of the internet as a streamer on gaming platform Twitch, lost in “the horniest game I’ve ever played in my life”, Baldur’s Gate 3 (“You can pick your character’s genitalia,” she says. “There’s three different penis options.”)It wasn’t just live music that was making her sad; suddenly all music was off the table. Performance was her job and every song was a reminder of what she was losing. Having previously been dropped by Polydor after Nothing’s Real failed to meet its commercial expectations, she also started taking on the weight of an industry in turmoil. “Also I just couldn’t write,” she says. “I had nothing to say. I would be talking to my partner going: ‘Maybe that’s all I will ever offer to the world.’ I think if that had been it, it would have been really sad because it was like I had one and a half goes.”Someone gives me money to make a record, then they’re like: Oh, that was a bad ideaShortly after releasing a deluxe version of Forevher in early 2021, and moving back to London, she was dropped again, this time by the indie label Secretly Canadian. Shura says she hadn’t been surprised at being dropped by Polydor, who signed her at the peak of music-blog influence, after her tactile, SoundCloud-only 2014 debut single Touch went viral. Having taught herself production via YouTube tutorials while working as a video editor, she found the major label ecosystem alienating and intimidating, and she was clearly an odd fit. When she was being touted around various labels, she remembers one asking her what her “thing” was. “They said: ‘Clean Bandit play classical instruments, so is your thing like: Hi, I’m in a beanie.’” She looks agog, pulling at her – you guessed it – beanie. In the end, after signing to Polydor, she decided her thing was being “stressed out”.The second, most recent, label departure – this time from an indie – stung, however. “I talk to my musician friends now and I’m like: ‘Look, if you’re dropped, come to me,’” she laughs. “That’s my expectation: someone gives me some money to make a record and then they’re like: ‘Oh that was a bad idea.’” She pauses. “But it was actually quite painful. Like, ‘By the way, I know it’s a bit of a pandemic and you have no income but, you know, bye.’”Shura’s ability to find solace in tricky times extends to the album’s sonic palette. While lyrically the album is saturated with the pandemic’s sense of uncanny – the single Richardson is about Shura taking laps round her small apartment “to feel the air on my face”, while other songs touch on loneliness, panic and dislocation – musically it feels like a warm hug. Recorded live with a small band, it leans into 60s Americana, all honeyed harmonies, rich organ and the gentle pitter-patter of drums. “Writing-wise,” she says, “I met myself where I was listening-wise.”It was the tactile songs of US singer-songwriter Cassandra Jenkins that helped Shura fall back in love with music. “It was the perfect record for that time,” she says of Jenkins’s intimate An Overview on Phenomenal Nature album. “I could curl up into it and it just comforted me.” Jenkins adds backing vocals to Richardson, and even makes a cameo in our interview when one of her songs gently wafts out of the cafe’s speakers. The perpetually fidgety Shura suddenly sits bolt upright. “Fuck off! She’s here. Cassandra, that’s so nice of you to turn up.

The artwork for I Got Too Sad for My Friends finds Shura sitting on a rock in the Bannau Brycheiniog (Brecon Beacons), sporting armour over her everyday clothes and looking for a battle that never comes.It was semi-inspired by Baz Luhrmann’s Romeo + Juliet and how “a lot of lesbians of a certain age” either fancy its star Leonardo DiCaprio or “want to be him, or want to be a woman that looks like him”. The armour has a much bigger significance, too. “[During the pandemic] I found that I was doing stuff that I thought was protecting me from pain or sadness, that absolutely made things worse; by retreating, by reaching out to my friends less and isolating myself further. So here I am in armour, ready to fight, but what is my armour protecting?”As she starts to grow more animated, those gym-toned arms reveal a delicate sword tattoo in honour of the new record. She gets one for each album, she explains, which confuses me after I spot a drawing of a jolly, round character. “Oh, that’s just a happy potato,” she laughs. When I suggest she’s just let slip the title of album four, she smiles, and allows herself to look to a future she thought was gone: “It’s that or Hoffa’s fat pad impingement.”I Got Too Sad for My Friends is out now.Explore more on these topicsMusicPop and rockinterviewsShareReuse this content"

It was all sketch, absurdity, silliness. I didn’t get into standup until my university days because I just didn’t think it was a vocation, especially not in New Zealand.You served four years in the New Zealand army when you were a young man. Did it inform your career in comedy at all?I grew up watchingDad’s Armywith my mum, and that’s one of the reasons I joined up. I thought all the action would be fun. I brought my sense of humour with me so got told off a lot. Turns out, it wasn’t really Dad’s Army but itwasthe New Zealand army, so it wasn’t too far off. We had moments where we were literally rescuing sheep. I’ve taken some of the skills with me into my career: self-discipline, drive, getting up on time.View image in fullscreenInfluence … The Goodies in 1973, from left, Tim Brooke-Taylor, Graeme Garden and Bill Oddie.Photograph: South Coast Press/Rex/ShutterstockCan you recall a gig so bad, it’s now funny?I did a gig on an aeroplane just after 9/11 for a brand-new airline. They wanted to have me on the inaugural flight as an entertainer. It was at 8am. People started looking at me like I was a threat. I did some weird stuff about clouds and some of the airline upholstery. One thing you’d never do as a standup is go and sit with your audience if it goes badly. But I had no other choice. One guy said to me, “Why’d you do that?” I said, “I got paid.” No one believed it.What has inspired your latest show, The Legend Returns?It’s about me fighting against artificial intelligence. Back in the day it was fun when robots were robots, but now it’s actually getting quite scary. The future doesn’t look good – especially in creativity. AI should just leave us alone because all it’s doing is plagiarising us, stealing our stuff, and people are then taking advantage of that.It’s a huge subject matter, but I do it in a very silly way, a very human way. I think there’s no robot that could do what I do, and that includes all the flaws. When I screw up, when I break the fourth wall, take the mickey out of myself or laugh at myself or what I’m doing, that’s very human.Do you have any pre-show rituals?I stretch because I do a lot of physical comedy. Drink water. I normally have one beer to make me remember the good old rock’n’roll days.What’s one of the strangest encounters with a fan you’ve had?I’ve had a lot of things made for me. Depending on my material, they’ll find something in the stories I tell. Back in the day, I said I was the freestyle dance champion of a small town called Ohakune in New Zealand. So someone knitted me a woollen jacket that had “dance champion” on the back. Also, someone made a small bust of me once. I remember withFlight of the Conchords, Jemaine Clement once received a plaster impression of his lips. I don’t know how they did it, but to present something to you that isofyou is insane. Luckily, no one’s given me a full clay model of my nose or anything like that.Did you have any idea when filming thatFlight of the Conchordswould have such lasting cultural impact?I don’t think we did. And that was good, because we really felt like we were making this thing for ourselves. Because we were young and it was our first time in the States making something with their money and their brilliance, we got caught up in it all. We just concentrated on how could we be so funny that we’re cracking each other up and have to redo the scene?As we had some control over the show, we could improvise and do seven or eight takes. And that was really the key, because I got funnier every take. I know that for a fact. I still say this to people when I do shows. I say give me a couple more because I’ll peak on the sixth take.View image in fullscreenPirate captain … Darby with Fred Armisen in Our Flag Means Death.Photograph: Album/AlamyWithOur Flag Means Death, you went from “that guy from Flight of the Conchords” to a Tumblr sex symbol overnight. What wasthat like?I’m a comedy guy, not a sex symbol. [Pirate character] Stede wore some very attractive attire but is still a very insecure, bizarre, weird little man who has to try and find himself. The character was perfect for me because I like dressing up, being the captain, and I do overcompensate with authority because I really have no idea what I’m doing. There were definitely some similarities there, but I was not expecting anything on a sexual note from fans. The audience are amazing. They really come to the table, but it was a little bit too much for me.You’ve long had a passion for cryptozoology. What draws you to creatures like Bigfoot and Mothman?It’s the mystery of the unknown. I think I’ve always thought of myself as someone that mysteriously shouldn’t be here. I was a mistake as a child, as I was born nine years after the rest of my siblings, so I think I’ve always had this belief in what else is out there.I think these things are real. Not all of them, but I love the idea that we don’t really know and we can search. The search for stuff that we don’t know yet – I think that’s one of our purposes here.Rhys Darby: The Legend Returns ison tourin the UK and Ireland until 29 June, and atPleasance Courtyard, Edinburgh, 1-10 AugustExplore more on these topicsStageComedy Q&AComedy (Stage)Comedy (Culture)Flight of the ConchordsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The winds have ripped up houses, shops, factories and art studios, whirled the pieces in a mighty twister and smashed them to earth in pulverised fragments. Now they scatter South London Gallery, towering over you in two random heaps, with other pieces gathered in clusters, floating on the walls, thrown all over the floor. Crunch, crunch – you can walk on broken bits of wood carpeting the ground, negotiating your way around bigger debris, as you inspect the ruins of America – and, sadly, of American art.Seven decades ago, Jackson Pollock put America at the forefront of abstract art with looping and spiralling vortices of energy that he created by pouring and flicking paint on to a horizontal canvas. Leonardo Drew grew up in a housing project in Bridgeport, Connecticut, in the 60s and is consciously influenced by Pollock, whose work he first saw in a book at his local library. Where Pollock threw paint, Drew scatters splintered wood, yet his sculpture can also be seen as painting, since before breaking up many of the boards and planks in this show, he painted them. The entire installation can be seen as a huge action painting in 3D. Drew even numbers his works like Pollock did: the alternative title of Ubiquity II is Number 436.But if action painting in the 50s was a freewheeling image of the improvisational American spirit, this is the debris of a shattered American dream. You get a sense, contemplating Drew’s crafted rubble, of surveying the aftermath of a cataclysmic weather event or walking the streets of a US town obliterated by the latest freak hurricane or tornado. This is painfully resonant given the Trump administration’s policy of active climate crisis denial, including the withdrawal of government funding for research. And, as the eerie silence of this world in smithereens, broken only by the wood cracking under your feet, reminds you, some of the most traumatic indicators of climate emergency, from storms to fires, have hit the US itself.View image in fullscreenConsciously influenced by Jackson Pollock … Ubiquity II.Photograph: Studio Stagg/Andy Stagg @studiostaggDrew doesn’t claim his art is political in any direct way: it is abstract. I’m reading Trump into it. But although I could go on like this, identifying artistic echoes and urgent themes, it’s forced. This artwork is disappointing. On paper, and in photographs, Drew’s work seemed spectacular, yet as soon as I walked into the gallery my heart sank. There’s a lumpen, flat, unthreatening feeling to this show. It’s as depressing as a destroyed town but without the danger or horror. In fact, it’s hard to feel anything at all about an assemblage that fails to suggest motion, energy or life.When you enter the long, tall white space, the first disappointment is the way wooden items are stuck around the walls. They don’t look like flying fragments propelled through space, but decorations on a bedroom wall. Some resemble cricket bats. One looks like a gun. Whatever they are meant to be, they are as radical as wrapping paper.The second blow to anyone seeking artistic fun is the sight of the two tottering heaps with a valley between them through which you can pass. “Tottering” is inaccurate, for they are clearly not about to fall. You can see the scaffolding on which the artist has built his Towers of Babel. Everything is safely, staidly stuck in place. I’m not saying it should fall, but where is the dramatic tension?The only hint of danger or dynamism is in the starbursts around the floor. One looks like a fist of rapidly expanding matter. It makes you think of the exploding enemy plane in Roy Lichtenstein’s painting Whaam! – which is itself an ironic homage to Pollock’s action art. Maybe the contrast is deliberate, for Drew says his art is a meditation on entropy. So the energetic, propulsive assemblages may be newborn stars or fragments of the big bang. But the sagging heaps of crap are the universe approaching its death, Earth under an avalanche of garbage, America at the end of its time.Maybe so. But it’s dreary to look at. It’s not just at the macro scale that the installation appears inert. Every small chunk you look at, in the heaps, on the walls, has an arbitrary wanness up close. Nothing seems to mean much, or matter much.Perhaps Drew is simply crushed by these times. But it seems to me this work, with its conscious echoes of Pollock that fail to recapture the excitement or surprise of America’s modern art glory days, is a symptom of a nation in cultural as well as political decline. Trump’s America is a shell of what it once was. Americans were creatively brilliant not so long ago, pumping out the best art, novels, music. But this exhausted art looks to me like the product of a decaying country.South London Gallery from 30 May to 7 DecemberExplore more on these topicsInstallationArtreviewsShareReuse this content"

Its team talks teenage sex work, nostalgia for Tony Blair, and why TV drama is so posh it’s like Jane AustenFri 30 May 2025 08.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 30 May 2025 12.51 EDTShareWhen the BBC was casting its adaptation ofParis Lees’s autobiography,What It Feels Like for a Girl, it wasn’t the only one wrestling with how to find the right actor to play the lead in a biopic. “Cher did an interview,” smiles Lees, “and she said: ‘We just can’t find somebody that’s Cher.’ I was like: ‘Same, girl. I hear your struggles.’ So me and Cher have been going through it.” Sitting next to Lees is the actor they went with, Ellis Howard, whom you may remember as the sapling Ivan VI in HBO seriesCatherine the Great, but who you will never have seen being this luminous.“In the beginning, we were looking for a trans person,” Lees says. She and Howard are sharing a Zoom screen, and it’s not so much that they look similar as that they both look so cinematic, they seem to match – “But then I just knew, the moment I saw Ellis, that this cheeky, cheeky person could do it.”Lees is known in the public eye via a series of triumphant firsts: the first trans columnist for Vogue, the first trans woman to present on Radio 1, on Channel 4. But her early life was harsh, brutal at times. She was relentlessly bullied at school for being gay, and carried the weight of her father’s homophobia, expressed in both formless anger and embarrassment. She became a “rent boy” when she was 14, but was astonished when she read, in a review of her book inGraziathat she’d been abused. “Then I thought: ‘Hang on a minute. What else would you call that?’ It took me a while to realise that was abusive. When people are vulnerable, when they’re told they’re worthless, that they’re almost half a person, you seek validation in the wrong places. It makes me incredibly sad, but it was really important to show my perspective at that time, not my perspective now.”View image in fullscreenTrue to life … What It Feels Like for a Girl author Paris Lees.Photograph: Sophia Spring/The GuardianHoward’s performance is exquisite: subtle and daring, true to the fact that it would be years before the teenage sex work processed as a violation – and at the time Lees was thrilled about earning all those fivers. “When you force people into the shadows, don’t be surprised when they go fucking dark,” Howard says. “You’ve got to silence the part of your brain that goes: ‘I am an adult, I am a leftwing progressive.’ You’ve got to go to a place of wonderment and curiosity.”Paris Lees’s perspective in the book, which comes across as strongly on the screen, is joyful – this is an incredibly buoyant coming-of-age story, as Howard describes. “When we were cast, all of us felt like we had touched gold, here. Whether it’s our queerness, whether it’s our class, whether it’s the scars we’ve been given that make us feel so seen by it, everyone came to give it their all. How often do you get these unicorn projects, that feel so alive? It felt so rare.”Lees gives her adolescent self the pseudonym Byron, and their story opens in 2000, when things were bleak as hell for a gay teenager in a suburban, declining bit of Nottinghamshire. But this is very much not how they felt at the time: “I definitely had a sense that things are getting better,” says Lees. “We thought this was the end of history. I had this sense that people were living longer, wages were going up, flights were getting cheaper, they were cloning sheep. It felt like there was going to be more democracy, there was hope, there was a future. We were going to get there with gay rights. I didn’t dare to believe we’d get there with the other stuff.”It’s beautifully told in the drama, through friendships with divas and ketamine in nightclubs, that to be young in that era may have felt like a train wreck, but didn’t feel hopeless. Howard, who was born in 1997, chips in, “I’m nostalgic for a time I wasn’t born in. Listening to P talk about the possibility of Blair and Brown, talk about a time when the NHS functioned, when school ceilings weren’t caving in on people’s heads, maybe I’ve doctored that into my brain, but I feel like I can remember a time when progress was possible. Although if I’m honest, my political awareness really began with austerity.”If homophobic bullying was a thing of the past by the 2010s, “God, no one told my fucking school,” he says. “No one told Norris Green in Liverpool. I was definitely ostracised. I come from a family of ‘aaaah’ blokes [impossible to fully convey the meaning, or mad charm of that “aaaah” - sort of aggro and in-your-face]. I just had this unwavering sense of, I won’t be bullied. You’re not gonna get me. One of the reasons why I felt so seen by the book, is because this is a kid who was resilient to a mythic level. Your conditions can harden you. That was my experience of school, anyway.”View image in fullscreen‘I’m nostalgic for a time I wasn’t born in’ says Howard.Photograph: Enda Bowe/BBC/HeraThe double-edged nostalgia for that time – post-industrial drudgery leavened by the smell of escape – is particularly poignant to watch now. Nobody in 2000 (trust me on this, I was there) would have predicted that 25 years later, trans people would be openly vilified in the media and drag queens castigated as perverts. It feels as if we inched forward to Scandinavia on LGBTQI+ rights, only to hurtle back to Weimar. Lees says it’s more complicated than that. “It feels like there’s been a weird reversal. The public conversation in the media and politics has become very toxic. But think back: when did you ever see somebody working in Boots, that was trans, in the year 2000? When was your GP trans? When were trans people ever allowed to participate in life or society? Nobody had a job; you either had to be a prostitute or you had to not be out.”She breaks off – “I’m a little bit guarded about this, because it’s obviously relevant, but I don’t want everything I do to be framed within trans activism. I hate it when people call me a trans activist. I’m not involved in activism now. Obviously, I am trans. I can’t escape that. I feel like I could have died, somebody could have shot me, I could have been revived on the operating table, and the headline would still be about being trans.”Both Lees and Howard see What It Feels Like … as being an exploration of the marginalisation of poverty at least as much as it is about trans identity – if not more so. Again, it’s complicated: sometimes sex and gender identity cancels out class identity, in the sense that Lees thinks “being trans has possibly opened doors for me that wouldn’t have [otherwise] been opened, to a working-class person”. Other times, the world demands that you pick a lane. “Often times, as an actor, as a writer, I’m thinking, who am I today? Am I this scrappy working-class kid? Or am I the sensitive queer boy? And those things can’t reconcile. To be swallowed in this industry, one has to present oneself in a fixed way. Who gets to live authentically is so determined by your class.” She adds: “It’s a really big part of my identity, just coming from a scarcity mindset. When you grow up and you’ve got nothing, that has a huge effect on how I live my life, how I think about things, my sense of internal safety and security.”View image in fullscreenDivas licence … (from left) Laquarn Lewis, Hannah Jones, Ellis Howard, Alex Thomas-Smith and Adam Ali in What It Feels Like for a Girl.Photograph: Enda Bowe/BBC/Hera“Drama is so fucking posh,” Lees continues – not with indignation, almost amused, like she knows she speaks for pretty well everyone but the rest of the world are too polite to mention it. “I’m just so sick of it. We love all the actors with the posh accents, I get it, but let’s just make the space for some other people. It’s so boring, the Jane Austenness of it all, the comedy of manners; let’s have some real messy stories about real shit that happens. I love that we’ve got so many working-class actors on this show. The only place working-class people are represented is reality TV. I’ve had enough of the double-barrelled names. Working-class people are lyrical, we’re just not given a voice.”And if it’s a rare oversight by the class gatekeepers that this messy, exuberant story got on to TV, it also breaks out of a predictable aesthetic. “It’s so gorgeous to be in a working-class project that is extended beyond the kitchen sink, something that has so much colour and is so visually arresting,” says Howard. “It has a cinematic feel and scale that is normally only lent to middle-class stories [but is here] given to a working-class story set in the Midlands.”The whole thing has been a white-knuckle ride from the start, Lees says, “A bit like if they said: ‘We’re gonna take a picture of you naked. It’s going to be displayed in public. But don’t worry, we’re going to get good people in, you’ll have lots of creative control.’ Are you ever going to be happy with that picture? This is made out of my core memories.” It has led, however, to Lees’s relationship with Howard – part spirit-animal, part younger-self transformed – as well as some other beautiful performances. Both single out Laura Haddock as Byron’s mother, who Lees says managed to powerfully channel her mum, without necessarily looking very alike. And the ensemble of fallen divas – endearing, spiky performances from Laquarn Lewis and Hannah Jones, was “such a headfuck for me”, Lees says, as “there are the actual fallen divas, the real people. Then there are the characters that I created, based on them, in the book. Then there’s the TV interpretations, and the actors playing them, who formed their own breakaway group. A lot of what you see on screen, that is just them fucking around.”What It Feels Like for a Girl is on BBC iPlayer from 3 June.Explore more on these topicsDramaTelevisionLGBTQ+ rightsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

As long as she can remember, I have started each day by telling her it is pointless casual gamer cack. Now I write for the Guardian, I need to find a more eloquent way of putting that, so I thought I would have a go myself. I am begging you: do not do the same. Candy Crush Soda Saga nearly ruined me in a week.I like the game mechanics. As Oscar Wilde said, the man who doesn’t love sliding stuff to form chains of three or more matching shapes does not love life itself. This one is wrapped in a cute candy veneer, all fizzy bottles and gummy bears. And that makes the visuals so alluring. When you slide a Colour Bomb into a Candy Fish all the candies that colour get Candyfished and your eyes are treated to a bazillion of them fizzing around the screen destroying everything, while the firm yet gentle haptic feedback makes it a multisensory burst of pure, effervescent joy.“What’s that clicking noise?” my wife asks.“Don’t you play it with the haptic feedback on?”“Oh, I turned that off because I thought it was hurting my phone.”“In what way?”“I felt it was putting too much … pressure on it.” She says, like her phone is the USS Enterprise and she is Scotty diverting a dangerous amount of power away from the shields.We had many chats about Candy Crush while we both played the game in bed. I’m all for increased interspousal communication, but we used to do this kind of thing with broadsheet newspapers and now we’re matching jelly beans on phones.

It uses a board game path to fake big-time progression, but whether it’s me on level 150 or my wife on level 8,452 (gulp!) the pattern is the same: a few easy levels then a super hard one which, if you haven’t accumulated enough power-ups, is virtually impossible.That’s when the game drops its trousers and flashes its microtransactions. And by that stage you are so hooked by the mechanics and the colour you hand over your few quid for some extra virtual visual bobbins quicker and easier than those crazy kids getting drugs in The Wire. Oh yes! Candy Crush Soda Saga is the game Stringer Bell went to business school to invent. The cigarette was once hailed as the most efficient poison delivery system ever invented. Not now.This game “suggests” moves to you. These are frequently not the best ones. That is no accident. This is a game designed to make you fail. It’s a compulsion loop, sure, but one that encourages you to pay for the pleasure. It’s not gambling per se, because you know what you are buying, but, while gambling company ads nowscreamabout setting limits and walking away, this game screams at you to have one more go.I have been addicted to so many things in my life that I stopped counting. (I became addicted to counting my addictions as well.) But this ranks as one of the worst. It only takes three days until I am dangerously hooked. Last Sunday I played Candy Crush Pop Saga for three solid hours. I nearly missed theScottish Cup finalas a result. Unlike my wife, I was dipping into it during the rest of the day as well, thinking, “Oh it’s been 15 minutes, I may have ended up getting a power-up via the Bake a Cake sub game my Candy Crush team are helping me with.”The self-loathing of the addict envelopes me. I know this is not nurturing me in any way, but I cannot stop. At least cocaine was quick. In terms of time? In one week I wasted what could have been, in Zelda terms, one third of a Breath of the Wild, one half of a Twilight Princess or an entire Majora’s Mask. And at least they tell stories. If the deadline for this article hadn’t made me stop, I would have had to have buried my phone in a lime pit and set it on fire to escape from Candy Crush.The irony is that there’s no real difference between this and the arcade offerings that made me fall in love with gaming as child. Pacman, Frogger, Space Invaders et al were all designed to make you pump another coin in the slot when it winked CONTINUE Y/N at you. They were even more repetitive. So I guess by the definition detailed in this Candy Crush castigation, those games were also a waste of time.But why didn’t they feel like that?Because back then, all I had was time. It wasn’t the dwindling commodity it is in my 50s. Maybe if I played Galaxian now it would feel like playing Candy Crush: a descent into a gaming horror world so uncomfortable it’s like watching that Event Horizon movie on treadmill while wearing Lego pants. A game that offers nothing repeatedly. Waiting for Godot with gummy bears instead of tramps. Nothing happens, nobody comes, nobody goes – it’s awful.Explore more on these topicsGamesGame cultureMobile gamescommentShareReuse this content"

From having their minds blown by techno to fireworks night with Aphex Twin, they recall the highs – and explain their eternal ‘psychic’ bondFri 30 May 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 30 May 2025 10.04 EDTShareInSaint Etienne, it is usually Bob Stanley who suggests the band’s tightly defined album concepts. What if you graft folk melodies to dance music? Make vaporwave about early New Labour? While finishing ambient pop album The Night, released in the dark of last winter, Stanley pitched an even starker one for its successor: the end of their band.“I didn’t think I was saying anything uncomfortable or shocking,” says Stanley, affable and understated, in a park near his Bradford home. “When you’ve known each other for so long you have a psychic thing anyway. It felt like we would all agree.”I meet Pete Wiggs and Sarah Cracknell in a London bar, separate from Stanley – no falling out, they assure me, simply living as they do across Yorkshire, East Sussex and Oxfordshire is a scheduling nightmare. Wiggs couches his thoughts about Stanley’s proposition carefully. “Once I got used to it, I thought it was a great idea. We’ve not split up acrimoniously, and have some control over it.”International, out in September, will be the final Saint Etienne album. Bringing together collaborators including Nick Heyward, Xenomania, Erol Alkan and the Chemical Brothers – who appear on the fizzing and life-affirming new singleGlad– the album is a strictly-bangers leaving party for one of the most singular bands in British indie. Few albums are likely to contain rave hedonists Confidence Man and severe cult broadcaster Jonathan Meades, who provides text for the album’s sleeve. “I wanted to finish our album journey on a high,” says Cracknell. “Do something really special and stop in our prime.”Stanley remembers a time in pop when most groups did finish, powering pop’s forward motion. He argues that it has slowed, pointing to the decade it took for the hyperpop music on the PC Music record label – which he adored – to reach the mainstream on Charli xcx’s Brat last year. That type of underground-to-overground travel “used to happen all the time, and it would take 18 months”, says Stanley. Pop is “clearly nowhere near as important as it used to be – we might as well be talking about jazz or modern classical, where there’s great music but it’s not really adding much [to culture]. But music wasn’t that important before the 1920s, either.” Like Saint Etienne themselves, “these things don’t last for ever”.What about the current crop of exciting female pop stars? Stanley praises “the look, the sound, the artwork” of the “properly great” Charli, Lana Del Rey and Sabrina Carpenter. But he maintains that “music’s just not as central to people’s identities” as it was. If that sounds like a controversial position, he has others. “I hate Glastonbury,” he says. “Can’t stand it. A single setting for all kinds of music feels entirely wrong to me.”Stanley has always been opinionated about music. “I loved Grease,” remembers Wiggs of his early teens growing up alongside Stanley in Croydon. “Even then, Bob was telling me it was nothing on the original 50s stuff.” Later, the pair set up fanzines Pop Avalanche and Caff, but the indie music they covered became “very dreary”, Stanley says. “When house and techno came along it was like, ‘Oh, this is it.’”View image in fullscreen‘She didn’t sing with an American accent, which then was unusual’ … Sarah Cracknell fronting Saint Etienne in 1993.Photograph: Andy Willsher/RedfernsNeither of them were musicians, but radical, sample-heavy singles by UK producers Bomb the Bass and S’Express convinced them they didn’t need to be. Though Wiggs later studied for a film music degree, Stanley wears his inability to play an instrument as “an asset” – if he could play Chopin, he argues, his instincts as a pop fan might have diminished. Composer and orchestrator David Whitaker, who worked on their 1994 album Tiger Bay, saw his potential and offered him piano lessons. “Lovely bloke,” remembers Stanley, “but I was like, I really actually think I don’t want to learn.” Besides, “nobody ever asks Pet Shop Boys if they can play the piano”.Learning songwriting on the job meant that their first single was a cover. Only Love Can Break Your Heart was a thrilling landgrab of Neil Young’s 1970 original, at once faster and slower with brisk house pianos and languid dub reggae. The pair’s plan was to have rotating singers, in that case indie singer Moira Lambert, and down the pub they casually signed to friend Jeff Barrett’s new Heavenly Recordings, who released the single in May 1990.Cracknell heard the single and loved it. Born to a showbiz Windsor family (her mother, Julie Samuel, was an Avengers star, her father, Derek Cracknell, Kubrick’s recurring first assistant director), teenage Cracknell was galvanised by indie band Felt’s shambling melancholy and spent the 1980s “getting close to a record deal” with various bands. But she had given up, and was enrolled in drama school when Stanley’s girlfriend suggested her for a featured vocal. “I liked that she didn’t sing with an American accent,” says Stanley of his first impressions, “which then was unusual.”But what attracted Cracknell to them? “They had the 1960s, dance music and melancholy,” she smiles. Stanley and Wiggs asked Cracknell to become the group’s sole, permanent singer, and the newly minted trio recorded debut Foxbase Alpha in the Mitcham council house of producer Ian Catt’s parents. Using samples from bygone British pop and TV – there were too many legal challenges to US samples at the time – the album was powered by a tension between pop’s past and present that would become a very Saint Etienne mix, packed with shout-outs to the city they had just moved to.View image in fullscreenSaint Etienne at Shepherd’s Bush Empire in 2012.Photograph: Jim Dyson/Redferns/Getty Images“I was always scared of London, growing up in Croydon,” says Stanley, who remembers marvelling over exotic neighbourhood names such as Shacklewell and Haggerston. “This was when all the districts were very different from each other.” The trio explored London through its Irish pubs and Portuguese cafes, “pie and mash shops, old London things”. That geography was all over their 1993 masterpiece So Tough, with trip-hop and wide-eyed symphonic pop bathed in bright echo – as if recalling a radio show from last night’s dream.They argue that they used success to do what pop fans, rather than what Stanley views as their more tribal indie peers, would prioritise, like releasing a Christmas single or wearing gold lamé suits on the telly. “We were all quite hedonistic,” Cracknell says of those years, “but maybe that’s why we stayed together? We used to go out to clubs a lot.” This led to remixes by Andrew Weatherall and Autechre. “We went to watch Bonfire Night fireworks in Highbury with Aphex Twin,” remembers Stanley, after visiting the elusive producer at his flat to commission a remix.I found it very difficult to get through singing the last song on the album without crying. The realisation really hit meSarah CracknellDespite inviting a nascent Oasis to support them – Stanley had met Noel Gallagher as a roadie, and they all loved the band’s Live Forever demo – they avoided being dubbed Britpop, which Stanley today terms “nationalistic” and “the absolute antithesis” of their project. The pounding Eurodance of 1995’s He’s On the Phone protested against that era’s guitars, and became their biggest hit. The producer who mixed the track, Brian Higgins, offered them a demo that they turned down: it became Believe by Cher. “We’d probably be living in solid gold houses now,” says Stanley.Reinventing for Y2K, they decamped to Berlin with glitchy electronic trio To Rococo Rot, who teased them about indulgences such as changing chords. They dialled down the bleeps and thuds of the city’s club scene, resulting in their subtle and slept-on album Sound of Water. Its second single, Heart Failed, bitterly surveyed New Labour Britain and its market-driven urban regeneration: “Sold the ground to a PLC / Moved the club out to Newbury / Sod the fans and their families.” That flattened culture was explored again in the 2005 documentary Saint Etienne made with film-maker Paul Kelly about east London’s desolate Lower Lea Valley before it disappeared to Olympic development.Throughout their career, Stanley is proud that Saint Etienne got “no bigger or smaller” in the size of venues they played, and cites Bob Dylan and Prince as role models for staying true to oneself. They all credit their decision to swear off long tours as key to longevity. “How the hell do people do this?” Stanley remembers thinking after even a relatively brisk jaunt.“That, and we’ve all got complementary personalities,” says Wiggs. “No horrific egos,” agrees Cracknell.More recently, 2021’s I’ve Been Trying to Tell You used the melancholic vaporwave genre to examine late-90s nostalgia (they were disappointed that no one worked out that its track names were all horses that won on the day of Labour’s 1997 landslide). By the time of The Night, Stanley was suffering sleepless nights raising a small child while Wiggs and Cracknell were fretting about older children leaving home. The drizzly, downbeat album contained spoken word from Cracknell mourning the “energy and belief” of their 20s and was provisionally titled Tired Dad. They were “talking to people of a similar vintage to us, and being honest about it”, says Wiggs.View image in fullscreenSaint Etienne today, from left: Pete Wiggs, Sarah Cracknell and Bob Stanley.Photograph: Awaiting credit infoRecording International was low on drama – “because we’re English”, says Stanley – until final song The Last Time, written as a farewell to each other and their loyal audience. “I found it very difficult to get through singing it without crying,” says Cracknell, whose confiding and soulful vocals have arguably been Saint Etienne’s greatest asset. “It was the last song we recorded for the album, and the realisation really hit me.”Outside the project that has consumed them for three decades, Wiggs is working on a film soundtrack, Stanley is writing more books (he has already written two doorstopping histories of pop music), and the two will continue their celebrated archival pop compilations for reissue label Ace Records. Cracknell winces that she has “not thought past the end of 2025”, which makes her anxious. Is there a risk their end might not be permanent? “I don’t think there is,” says Stanley, who is looking forward to meeting his bandmates and their families without talking shop. Wiggs and Cracknell’s kids are, they tell me proudly, “like cousins”.Cracknell, an only child, was “always collecting siblings” – until Saint Etienne. Asked what she is most proud of, it is not their 13 albums or Top of the Pops appearances, but their friendship. “That we have such a bond between the three of us,” she says, looking out now to the bar’s exit. “And that will never go.”International by Saint Etienne will be released by Heavenly Recordings in September.Explore more on these topicsSaint EtiennePop and rockDance musicfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Think Again was a sequel to her Girls series for teenagers, which was published between 1998 and 2002, and revisited its protagonist Ellie, who in the new book is turning 40.It became a bestseller, resonating with fans who grew up with Ellie and her friends. Wilson has since announced a second adult sequel, due out in August, this time revisiting her 1999 children’s book The Illustrated Mum.Writing these sequels “gives me pleasure”, Wilson told the audience at theHay festivalin Powys. But although she plans to write more, she said Beaker, her most famous character, was unlikely to be a subject.Wilson said Beaker had become much bigger than just the character she created, largely thanks to the popular TV series based on the novels. The feisty, curly haired heroine means a great deal to Wilson personally, too: “She’s my girl that made everything happen for me.”So while she was happy to write about Beaker as an adult from the perspective of her daughter, Jess, writing about a grownup Tracy does not appeal as it would involve writing about her sex life. “I don’t want to go there,” the 79-year-old author said.However, Wilson did add that over the years she had learned not to say “I would never do that”. In two or three years’ time – “if I’ve got them!”, the author joked – “something or other” might make her think: “Ah, I could do it this way,” she said. “So who knows?”Wilson said she did know which of her former characters was next to be revisited in an adult book, but she hadn’t started writing it yet and her publishers wouldn’t allow her to say who it was. She said she hoped the book would be out next year, “and I hope it will be a good choice”.She acknowledged that some people might think she was only taking on these adult projects because she “can’t get any new ideas”, but she insisted that was not true. “But I do like to go back,” she said. “It’s a kind of literary Friends Reunited.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

Ticketmaster said that – in the highly likely event – that opt-in requests outnumber availability, tickets will be allocated at random. Opting in applies to entire ticket orders, not individual tickets within a single order.Posting on X, many fans were irritated by the news, which comes just shy of a month before the tour begins in Cardiff on 4 July. The five concerts in Manchester will be between 11 and 20 July.VIP ticket holders also sought information on whether they would automatically be allocated a place in the front section. The Guardian has contacted representatives forOasisfor comment.Accused by one fan this week of reuniting just for money, Liam Gallagher replied: “It’s for many reasons money way down the list”.Oasis also appear to have disappointed erstwhile drummer Zak Starkey, recently let go twice by the Who, who told BBC Breakfast he was “gutted” that the band had chosen Joey Waronker – who performed on last year’s collaborative album by Liam Gallagher and John Squire – for the tour. The rest of the lineup is yet to be officially announced.British economists, meanwhile, are unlikely to complain about the looming tour, the band’s first dates since splitting 16 years ago. Fans areexpected to spendmore than £1bn on tickets, accommodation, food, drink, outfits and merchandise, with the gigs expected to be the most popular and profitable in British history.Wonderwallets, part of the Barclays Consumer Spend report, estimated that the 1.4 million fans attending the show would spend more than £766 per person, generating £1.06bn. The sums exceed Barclays’ estimate for Taylor Swift’s Eras tour last year – which came in at £997m – but Oasis are playing two more shows than Swift did.Explore more on these topicsOasisManchesterTicketmasterPop and rocknewsShareReuse this content"

Stencilled across it are the words “I want to be what you saw in me”.A Banksy fansite claimed that the work was inLe Panier, a district north of Marseille’s port that is known for its graffiti, which includes several works by theFrench street artist Invader, who uses a pixelated style.ButBBC Verifyfound that it matched a Google Street View image ofRue Felix Fregier, a backstreet in the St-Lambert part of the city, just south of the port. This covered street, like many in Marseille, is lined with lighthouse-shaped bollards and includes vents of the kind visible in some of the images of the new Banksy.Close to the latest work, revealed on Thursday, is a tag that appears to read Yaze, which is the mark used by a Canadian graffiti artist who also goes by the name Marco the Polo and citesBanksyas an inspiration.Banksy’s works have fetched millions at auction, prompting speculation over the Bristol graffiti artist’s identity.Inspiration for the quote in the lighthouse artwork may have come from the songSoftlyby the Tennessee-based country band Lonestar, which features the lyric:“I want to be what you see in me.I want to love you the way that you love me.”A swathe of animal-themed Banksy works appeared in London last year, includinga rhino seemingly mounting a silver Nissan Micra, two elephant silhouettes with their trunks stretched towards each other, three monkeys that appeared to be swinging on a bridge, and agorilla on a shutter at London zoo.Since then, Banksy has posted a mural depicting theMadonna and child.Explore more on these topicsBanksyFranceStreet artArtEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

A wide set of stairs remain, where those fleeing the Luftwaffe could descend from Chancery Lane tube station, though the entrance has long been blocked off.View image in fullscreenConstruction of the Kingsway tunnels under Holborn in London began in 1940.Photograph: David Levene/The GuardianLater in the war, the SOE moved in to dream up all manner of imaginative ways to thwart the Nazis.The tunnels’ next incarnation was as the Kingsway telephone exchange, which in the 1950s served as an internal communications exchange during the cold war. An artesian well, to provide fresh water to those stuck underground in the event of a nuclear attack, remains.British Telecom took over the site in the 1980s, creating the world’s deepest licensed bar for use by the government staff. The old bar, decorated in then fashionable brown, orange and yellow, also remains, as does the long-disused staff canteen. The plan now is to create a new bar, with claims to be the deepest in any major city.Under the proposals, which have been granted full planning permission, the site will be developed into a three-in-one attraction – exhibitions, immersive interactive exhibitions and the bar. Exhibitions aboutJames Bondand the cold war, as well as a memorial to the blitz, have all been mooted, and subjects will change regularly.Taking inspiration from venues such asLes Bassins desLumièresin Bordeaux, other spaces will provide fully immersive digital experiences.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It aims to attract up to 3 million visitors a year, revitalising an area close to the City of London which has had reduced footfall since the Covid pandemic.The venue will provide “the world’s most authoritative permanent exhibition of military intelligence”, said Gen Sir Jim Hockenhull, the commander of Strategic Command and colonel commandant of the Intelligence Corps.“The tunnels will provide a dramatic and historic backdrop for an exciting new approach to telling the story of the past, present and future of military intelligence.”This exhibition will feature stories from the Battle of Britain and D-day, the extraordinary espionage operations of the cold war and the fight for the Falklands to peace-keeping missions and the terrorist threat of the 21st century. A special exhibition, created by the museum, will be dedicated to the SOE.Angus Murray, the chief executive of London Tunnels, said: “The tunnels, built and designed to protect Londoners during the blitz, are the ideal backdrop to tell the remarkable, and untold, stories of the men and women who played a vital role in protecting Britain then, and the role of the armed services protecting Britain today.”Explore more on these topicsMuseumsLondonSecond world warJames BondMilitaryWinston ChurchillIan FlemingnewsShareReuse this content"

The Sex and the City spin off hits its strideThe series has given up trying to squeeze its characters into the modern age and is content to justbe.Fans of the original will sink into it as if it is made of marshmallows and airRebecca NicholsonFri 30 May 2025 17.00 EDTShareIt all fell into place for me around the shoe montage. Roughly halfway through the third season ofAnd Just Like That, there is an on-screen procession of footwear, strident and unapologetically far too long. Carrie has been accused by her downstairs neighbour of walking too loudly on the floor above his bed. A parade of sandals, boots and mules strut back and forth across a polished and expensive wooden floor. I watched this march of the stilettos and began to suspect that the storyline had been retrofitted to the idea of simply showing off the shoes. And I realised that, even if that is the case, I don’t mind at all, because And Just Like That has found its feet.It took a while for it to get there, but finally, the Sex and the City spin-off feels comfortable in its own skin. If the first two seasons were fondly received but sometimes excruciating exercises in attempting to squeeze its characters into the modern age, then this feels like a loosening of the belt. The leads are no longer trying to be anything other than themselves: absurdly rich New Yorkers in their 50s, troubled mostly by the burdens of making sure they spend enough time with their friends. Life’s primary emotional entanglements – love, work, family – are present, sure, but they hum away lightly, like ambient noise, any sharp corners dulled by vast riches.Having sold her single-girl apartment, Carrie is now living in a sparsely furnished, absolutely massive Gramercy Park townhouse. She is still with Aidan, though he remains in Virginia, taking care of his troubled teenage son. It is a long distance relationship, with the emphasis on distance. Charlotte is still a happily married mother of two teenagers, with a successful art-dealing business, though early in the season, her dog gets cancelled. Lisa is trying to get her documentary about pioneering Black women off the ground, but the stress of it means she is sleep-talking, so her husband, Herbert, has to move to the spare room. Seema, the not entirely convincing Samantha replacement, is trying to assert her worth in the workplace. Miranda is dating again, and looking for an apartment, and is a human rights lawyer, very much in that order of importance.You make a choice, with And Just Like That, of how to consume it. You can look at it and see its Nero-like qualities, stark and vivid. You could accuse its fluorescent fairytales of fiddling while Trump’s America burns. Much of Carrie’s ennui comes from whether or not she will buy a dining table that costs almost $7,000, so that she can begin to fill her still-empty mansion. The show scoffs at tourists in New York, rural life, the countryside, items of clothing that cost less than an average month’s rent.Yet I find myself sinking into And Just Like That as if it is made of marshmallows and air. It is funny, warm, and self-aware enough to just about get away with it. Miranda’s ex, Che, has departed from the women’s lives and in the six episodes released to critics, they aren’t mentioned at all. Che was And Just Like That trying too hard, and in their absence, there is a sense that it has stopped putting on a front. Now, it has a kind of gauzy acceptance that these women are fully ensconced in the rarefied world of Manhattan’s wealthy, middle-aged elite. The hardest they have to try is when endlessly discussing what emojis in text messages are really meant to say.It should be unbearable. But the show’s devotion to the fantasy of dedicated, lifelong, rock-solid friendship is what gives it a heart, and in turn, that gives its more egregious vulgarities a free pass. Most Sex and the City fans have been following the lives of Carrie, Charlotte and Miranda since 1998, and there is a specific comfort in seeing them (without Samantha, of course) operating as a unit, 27 years later. Every episode rolls on, as each minor drama softly bumps into another minor drama, with stakes so low that you have to crouch to see them. It is all so steady, so frictionless, as smooth as the foreheads of the Upper East Side.I have no idea if it is good or not. I truly, genuinely, don’t know. It remains filled with Samantha-esque quips and puns that, like the shoe montage, appear to have been worked backwards, as if the gags come first, and the plots are created to fit them. But if there was a reluctant fondness that came when watching the first two seasons, then that fondness now appears much more readily. Their concerns are so gentle, their worries so slight, that to watch it is to be lulled into a state of easy comfort. The stilettos march on, as they always did.And Just Like That season three aired on Sky Comedy and is available on NOW.Explore more on these topicsAnd Just Like ThatTV reviewTelevisionSarah Jessica ParkerreviewsShareReuse this content"

There are a few debatable aspects toJack Furness’s ingeniously busy production andTom Piper’s mirror-dominated stage designs, and on the opening night it took time for the show to fully hit its musical stride. Overall, though, this is an overwhelmingly convincing staging of a genuine music drama, and it will surely come to be seen as one of Garsington’s most notable milestones.The opera’s 18th-century setting, following Pushkin’s short story, is retained. But in every other respect this is an unmistakably dark 21st-century reading. Furness is good at inserting troubling new details into the opera’s apparently sunnier moments, literally so when black curtains zip across the late afternoon Garsington windows. The children playing soldiers on the banks of the Neva are here more sinister than cute, while the costume ball scene is riddled with transgressive suggestion. Suffice to say that the grand entrance of Catherine the Great after the ball scene’s pastorale will not end as traditionalists will expect either.View image in fullscreenBrooding … Aaron Cawley as Hermann in Queen of Spades at Garsington Opera.Photograph: Clive BardaA successful performance of The Queen of Spades never rests solely on the shoulders of the opera’s tortured antihero Hermann. Tchaikovsky’s opera contains too many other fine cameos and ensembles for that. But without an outstanding Hermann, the opera’s uniquely visceral impact might misfire. Fortunately, Garsington has a true Hermann in its ranks, in the shape of the Germany-based Irish tenor Aaron Cawley, who sings the role with prodigious intensity, almost too agonisingly, and with a brooding Heathcliffian presence which at times threatens to eclipse everything else on stage.Yet this is as it should be. Hermann’s obsessive gambling, social awkwardness and sexual frustration are the dramatic focus of the opera in ways that look forward to the 20th century, to Berg’s unhappy Wozzeck and to Britten’s troubled loner Peter Grimes, a role for which Cawley would be ideal. Under Douglas Boyd’s baton, Tchaikovsky’s compulsive and innovative score, full of expressive woodwind detail and driven forwards by the march of fate, does the rest.Among the other principals,Laura Wildeis a suitably haunted and haunting Lisa, movingly depicting her character’s journey from security to despair. Stephanie Wake-Edwards is bright and characterful as her friend Polina. Diana Montague, as vocally elegant as ever, plays the aged Countess without hamming the role. Robert Hayward uses his many arts to give more depth to Hermann’s friend Tomsky than usual, while Roderick Williams does an eloquently sympathetic turn as the disappointed Prince Yeletsky.Until 4 JulyExplore more on these topicsOperaClassical musicreviewsShareReuse this content"

In the case of these two plays, which distil the experience of being a modern-day Palestinian under fire, it would seem to be humour, albeit pitch black and acid sharp.Staged as part ofPalArt festivalandShubbak festival, they deploy absurdism, satire and radical joy, swerving between the horrors to capture immense human resilience in the face of unspeakable suffering.Ahmed Masoud’s futuristic playApplication 39 (for the 2048 Gaza Summer Olympics)imagines Gaza in the year 2040. An online prank by two siblings (Joe Haddad and Sara Masry) has resulted in Gaza winning the Olympic bid. A political crisis ensues in a land which is now entirely controlled by Israel – they can turn the food “on and off” we hear, which contains clear echoes of the currentblockage of aidby Israel, resulting in the starvation of civilians. This future world is only in the first phase of a ceasefire and rubble from the 2025 conflict is still lying untouched.Adapted by the Palestinian playwright from a short story he wrote in 2018, and directed by Cressida Brown, it blends satire with discussions on how to live under occupation, to resist or submit, and the possibility of peace. Alongside this are dramatic accounts of the horrors on the ground in Gaza which chime loudly with the present day; the siblings enact their memories of 2025 – lying under rubble as petrified children whose family is dead, homes razed, and the land turned into a godforsaken place.There is little need to suspend disbelief as they recount what they see and experience: hospitals and ambulances destroyed, mothers scrambling in panic down flattened streets with their children, hospital directors arrested and detained without charge. Given Israel’s ban on allowing journalists into Gaza, these seem like the closest thing to witness testimonies, all the more so because Masoud, whose own family members have been killed in Gaza by Israeli forces, has collected real-life accounts and threaded his play through with those words. There are deeply poetic and reflective moments but also a prevailing sense of a play performed in real time, its suffering contemporaneous, its story real and raw.The Freedom Theatre’sReturn to Palestinehas had a far longer gestation period – it was devised almost a decade ago, although this is its UK premiere. The company’s general manager,Mustafa Sheta, was until recently held without charge by Israeli authorities and the theatre in Jenin, in the West Bank, is no longer accessible to its artists. Still they have produced a finessed and exquisitely tragicomic piece of physical theatre, with magnificent clowning.Directed by Micaela Miranda and based on real stories collected from across Palestine, it follows Jad, a Palestinian-American, on his first visit to the homeland. He is naive, excited to see his family, and wants a tour of the territory. Together, the superb six-strong cast (Motaz Malhees, Amir Abu Alrob, Ameena Adileh, Sofia Asir, Alaa Shehadeh and Osama Alazzeh) twist or stretch to become hooting cars, beds, tables, chairs, and the Statue of Liberty. It is visually poetic in the shapes and shadows they create, and both deadly serious and gloriously silly in tone.View image in fullscreenConfined space … Return to Palestine.Photograph: Zoë Birkbeck PhotographyJust as in Masoud’s play, there is minimal staging, constrained this time to a narrow white rectangle on a black stage – a metaphor for the confined yet still contested land left for Palestinians in the region? Everyone is satirised, from Israeli officials at the airport who are horrified by Jad’s Muslim surname to Americans boasting freedom (while aiding occupation) and comically garrulous Arabs.Sudden moments of pain inject a drama that moves through trauma and into a joy that feels deeply radical, heartwarming and filled with love. As Jad travels across the West Bank, he witnesses the dead-eyed administrative implacability of the checkpoint guards, the stark contrast between cramped Palestinian camps and the world of the settlers, as well as violence and death. An oud player and percussionist are sensational, heightening the comedy and tension.Both shows give the current state of conflict its historical context: they speak of the Nakba, violent occupation, illegal settlements, daily injustices and casual daily killings of Palestinian civilians. This is more than just theatre. It is art, activism, political resistance and storytelling – painful, joyous, elemental and essential.AtTheatro Technis, London, until 1 JuneExplore more on these topicsTheatrePalestinian territoriesPolitical theatreGazaActivismreviewsShareReuse this content"

The country singer’s last two albums spent 29 weeks at the top of the US chart. This week his latest, fourth offering, I’m the Problem, had the biggest opening week of the year so far in the US as well as going straight in at No 1 in the UK.This prodigious achievement may owe a little to a canny release strategy: streaming metrics mean that longer albums often chart higher, and I’m the Problem weighs in at a staggering 37 tracks. Equally, all 37 are in the US singles chart this week, setting a new record – Wallen is a commercial phenomenon, the biggest country star to cross over to mainstream success since Taylor Swift.Like Swift, Wallen’s tours have graduated from arenas to stadiums, which makes this rare intimate album-launch show a spectacularly hot ticket. The preshow queue, in which Stetsons and cowboy boots figure large, stretches way down Chalk Farm Road in north London: “I hear 300,000 people tried to get tickets for tonight,” marvels Wallen.Yet it is hard to see why there is quite that level of fuss. Not even Wallen’s fiercest defenders would claim he is remotely groundbreaking. A laid-back, mustachioed, regular guy possessed of an easy-going charm, he simply perches on a bar stool and plays smooth, well-crafted country and western powered by earworm melodies.His six-piece band are slick and his lyrical themes are repetitive. Wallen sings about drinking to forget women who leave him because he drinks. He bids these escapers from his serial doomed relationships a self-pitying, passive-aggressive adieu: “If I’m the problem, you might be the reason.” Then he drinks some more, and longs for their return.Ten-gallon hits! Why country is the biggest pop music craze of 2024Read moreThese laments have the ring of authenticity. Wallen’s appeal rests largely in him being a flawed everyman figure (with two recent court convictions for public intoxication). The maudlin Superman finds him sighing that his toddler son will one day learn of his dad’s transgressions: “That bottle’s my kryptonite, brings a man of steel down to his knees.” It’s hokum, but oddly moving.Love Somebody has a melody as exquisite as Fleetwood Mac at their most swooning as Wallen craves a romance “stronger than the whiskey”. The witty wordplay inherent in all the best country is present and correct: Whiskey Glasses begins, “Poor me… pour me another drink.” And then Wallen takes his leave and ambles off to notch up a million more streams.Explore more on these topicsMusicCountryPop and rocklive music reviewsShareReuse this content"

The outre star of millennial self-satire Search Party and sidekick to the brilliantKate Berlant, Early has spent his career perfectly situated where generational social commentary meets flamboyant silliness. At his best tonight, he richly delivers on the expectation. And even if his best doesn’t sustain from start to finish, in the first half, when the Tennessee man addresses himself to frightened, vacuous, deracinated American modernity, he’s riveting.What’s interesting about Early’s approach is that – unlike Berlant,Leo Reich, and others – he doesn’t hide behind a character, or a grotesque version of himself. What we get is seemingly the real Early, larking around, sending up his own prissiness a little, but sharing observations on culture and its discontents that are strikingly idiosyncratic and unmistakably his own. Maybe some of the topics are familiar (pretentious food presentation in restaurants, say), but Early’s way of digging beneath them into richer cultural subsoil is distinctive. There’s a great routine about circumlocutory waiter-speak, and what it says about our fear of directness. Another skit about visiting the toilet while in company is both a goofy piece of self-mockery and a weirdly eloquent delve into shame and carnality in the era of the curated self.I make it sound heavy; it isn’t. Early is always on to the next thing, which is often outrageous and uproarious, like his routine about overinvesting in sexual role-play. (“I went full Meryl on his ass!”) All of this is punctuated by covers of pop hits by the likes of Madonna, Britney and – in a lovely closing duet with his musical wingman Hess – Dolly Parton. The songs aren’t always as gripping as the comedy. There’s a fairly basic audience participation interlude, and a sketch in character as denim-clad southern mom Vicky with a V that’s diverting, but lower-wattage than what’s gone before. It all adds up to a great show, though: entertaining in lots of ways and electrifying in some.Explore more on these topicsComedyJohn EarlyreviewsShareReuse this content"

It opens as a colourful story based on the author’s family: her grandmother’s morphine addiction, her aunt Zizi’s vanity (she “boasted that all she kept in her refrigerator were beauty products”), and her mother’s reluctance to talk about the past. But what were grandmother and Zizi doing in the pages of Nazi propaganda magazine Signal? The narrator learns her family were “Nazi sympathisers”, though the phrase hardly captures the zeal of her mother Lucie’s support. The details are shocking: to Lucie and her lover, “mice, rats and Jews were basically the same”, and she has no regrets after the war. “If all the French had been on the right side, Germany would have won.” Their blinkered support has lessons for today, too. “What does it matter if something is true or false,” asks one character, “if you believe it to be true?”View image in fullscreenLovers of Franz Kby Burhan Sönmez, translated by Sami Hêzil (Open Borders, £12.99)Nazi-supporting parents feature in this novel too, set in West Berlin in 1968, the year of revolutionary protests around the world. A young man of Turkish descent faces off against a police commissioner. Ferdy Kaplan is under investigation for killing a student – but his intended target was Max Brod, the executor of Franz Kafka’s estate who published Kafka’s work against his wishes. Police suspect Ferdy had an antisemitic motive against the Jewish Brod, “influenced by [his parents’] ideas”. There’s a Kafkaesque quality to the interrogation – “It is our job to assume the opposite of what you tell us,” the police say – but Kurdish author Sönmez is really interested in the question of who owns literature. Was Brod right to publish? Would Kafka be unknown if he hadn’t? The dialogue-led approach makes the book punchy and fast-moving, and brings some surprising twists before the end.View image in fullscreenBack in the Dayby Oliver Lovrenski, translated by Nichola Smalley (Hamish Hamilton, £14.99)Sixteen-year-old Ivor is a typical schoolboy in Norway: “every day sitting in the same classroom, getting smart, creating chaos” and torn between “the side of me that wanted to do good things, and the other side saying, chill man, no stress”. That other side tends to win, as he and his friends Marco, Jonas and Arjan get up to antics that may need further translation for middle-aged readers: “bunn a zoot”, “we blazed some lemon haze”, “we rocked up like we was about to harvest some bamboo”. But amid the intensity of young male friendship, there’s love, family loyalty and vulnerability. “Sometimes you hang the biggest towel you can find over the mirror [cos] you wanna smash the face of the brother staring back at you.” The energy and richness of this novel would be impressive, even if Lovrenski hadn’t been only 19 years old when he wrote it.View image in fullscreenWaist Deepby Linea Maja Ernst, translated by Sherilyn Hellberg (Jonathan Cape, £14.99)Five friends, one week, a summerhouse: sounds like a dream – which could become a nightmare. “It’ll be like our own clever talk show, fabulous and never-ending,” says one character. Danish debut novelist Ernst delineates her characters snappily, from Esben, an experimental poet who went commercial with a novel about his mother, to Gry, who “hasn’t eaten any carbohydrates in three weeks”. But what brings the friends together and drives them apart is sex. Central to this is “confused” Sylvia, who enjoys being dominated by her “dreamboat” girlfriend Charlie: “She has been a jug full of dark, heavy liquid, and now the jug is broken”, is her description of being brought to orgasm. But Sylvia also gets angry at the “vanilla hetero-banality” of the other happily settled couples. The novel is operatic in its emotional intensity and its surprise pairings, but ultimately a lament for lost youth. “Weren’t they true radicals just a second ago?” wonders Sylvia. Weren’t we all?Explore more on these topicsFictionTranslated fiction roundupFiction in translationreviewsShareReuse this content"

The lineup retains Adam O’Farrill (trumpet), Jacob Garchik (trombone), Patricia Brennan (vibraphone), Nick Dunston (bass) and Tomas Fujiwara (drums), augmented by Blue Note Records’ fiery, gospelly alto-sax star Immanuel Wilkins and the rugged, Wayne Shorter-like tenorist Brian Settles.These two players give this release a crucially different feel, lending richer tonalities and expressive range to Halvorson’s signature brass fanfares, boppish-to-abstract improv, restlessly interweaving melodies and vigilant drumming. Opener Full of Neon begins the set with a textbook piece of Halvorson ensemble variety: elliptically march-like percussion, squirming improv intro, fluent solos and luxurious ensemble passages with woodpecker-like horn chatter. Carved From starts to canter and chime after a soft, unaccompanied arrival in rich horn chords, and features driving improv from Halvorson and Wilkins, mixing crisply defined guitar figures and skidding elisions with flat-out, whooping alto-sax firestorms.The excitement of Halvorson’s music is not cinematic or illustrative, but in the kaleidoscopic fascination of its internal symmetries and conflict. Melody parts play rhythm patterns, then the melodies bend while the rhythms push on. Her harmonies sometimes echo jazz big bands, at others contemporary classical. The initially tender title track becomes a captivating journey of improv and constantly morphing thematic shapes, while Eventidal is a graceful guitar and vibes ballad, and the fast Absinthian and Amaranthine suggest hyper-compressed bebop lines. Recently discussing the quirkily wonderful English singer and songwriter Robert Wyatt in Jazzwise magazine, Halvorson said she loved his ability to blend “the weird with the beautiful”. She wouldn’t dream of it, but she could have been saying much the same of herself.Also out this monthThis year sees the 50th anniversary ofKeith Jarrett’s legendary Köln Concert, andNew Vienna (ECM), a 2016 gig from the now 80-year-old’s final solo tour, is a familiar but bewitching hour of hurtling free squalls, chugging-hook rockers and tender romances. Young French flautist and composerNaïssam Jalalfollows up2023’s acclaimed Healing Ritualswith the very different Souffles (Les Couleurs du Son), a set of eight diverse duos with eminent wind-players. Her flute glides animatedly around Louis Sclavis’s solemnly evocative bass clarinet, rises in clamorous harmonies with Émile Parisien’s soprano sax while she eloquently chants instrumentally and vocally asArchie Sheppplays gruffly bluesy tenor sax. And onAmoeba’s Dance (Trouble in the East), prize-winning Berlin saxophonist and composerSilke Eberhard’s enlarged Potsa Lotsa group makes vividly creative use of their leader’s intricately structured but constantly provocative pieces.Explore more on these topicsMusicJazz album of the monthJazzreviewsShareReuse this content"

This might be hard to believe, what with Carrie (Sarah Jessica Parker) and Aidan (John Corbett) resolute on their nonsensical “let’s wait five years to be together” pact. But don’t worry, Miranda (Cynthia Nixon) and Charlotte (Kristin Davis) are rolling their eyes with us. Will they make her see sense? Anyway, there’s still plenty of sex, outfits that turn the streets of NYC into a catwalk, the husky tones of Seema (Sarita Choudhury) and even a naughty night with a nun.Hollie RichardsonThe Power of Parker9.30pm, BBC OneThe start of a second season for this watchable if slightly pedestrian 90s-set sitcom about the complicated life and business affairs of Conleth Hill’s businessman Martin Parker.

Bono is a confident raconteur, as he relays anecdotes from his life – meeting his future wife and starting the band in the same week; Live Aid and his political campaigning; chatting in the pub with his dad – candidly and self-deprecatingly, while excerpts from U2’s songs act as commentary on his experiences.Simon WardellLive sportWomen’s One-Day Cricket, England v West Indies,12.30pm, Sky Sports Main EventThe first of three ODIs, from Derby.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionTV tonightfeaturesShareReuse this content"

When the launch of a deep-fake tool by Cory Michael Smith’s billionaire Venis plunges the world into financial and social meltdown, he and his alpha male peers – Jeff (Ramy Youssef), Randall (Steve Carell) and their host Souper (Jason Schwartzman) – insouciantly ponder exploiting this “moment of creative destruction” and taking over the world. As in Succession, Armstrong has a keen eye for the supercilious world of the super-rich, where people are expendable and petty grievances can be dressed up as utopianism.Sunday 1 June, 9pm, Sky AtlanticSee How They RunView image in fullscreenSam Rockwell and Saoirse Ronan in See How They Run.Photograph: Parisa Taghizadeh/DisneyPart affectionate throwback to classic Agatha Christie, part knowing sendup, Tom George’s engagingcomic whodunnitis set in the wake of a murder after the 100th West End performance of The Mousetrap in 1953.

But when the girl and her parents move to a big city, San Francisco, the other feelings – Anger, Fear, Disgust, but principally Phyllis Smith’s Sadness – come into play. An error in the handling of core emotions sends Joy and Sadness on a desperate quest into the weirder recesses of Riley’s mind to save their charge in a bitter, sweet tearjerker.Sunday 1 June, 3.30pm, BBC OneThe Three Burials of Melquiades EstradaView image in fullscreenTommy Lee Jones and Barry Pepper in The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada.Photograph: The Kobal CollectionTommy Lee Jones always appears most at home on screen with a stetson, a horse and a noble purpose.

Sat by the fire, he addresses his students.“This is not a wellness retreat. It is about getting out of your comfort zone.”I am in the Camden bush, on Dharawal and Gundungurra Country, for a four-day wilderness survival course taught by the consultant forTV’s most gruelling show, Alone Australia.On the itinerary: knife work, knots, emergency shelters, fire lighting, water collection, plant identification, solar and celestial navigation, plus emergency signalling and rescue techniques. On my person: fresh hiking boots, gold hoops, perfectly low-rise cargo pants and a black tee.The last time I went camping was with school in year 9, in a tent set up about 50 steps from a cabin. Out of my comfort zone, indeed – this time I don’t have a tent, or a toilet.After a short hike, we arrive at sunset to a large green tarp billowing gently. It’s a military parachute, Dedman tells us. We gather at a semicircle of stools beneath the canopy.View image in fullscreenThe bush skills class taking place under the military parachute.Photograph: Rafqa ToumaDedman gets straight to it. The goal of “survival” is to be found, he says. This isdifferent to bushcraft, which has a direct relationship with nature and draws from the skills traditional cultures used to live in the wilderness.Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morningDedman’s philosophy about the land and people’s role on it is clear just a few hours in: “Our existence here is based on the caring capacity of the Earth.“But we live in a system of expanding expenditure … at total odds with nature. Something is very broken with our system.”We go around the circle of 15 students, introducing ourselves. Most of us are novices, mainly Sydney and Canberra-based men with office jobs looking to reconnect with the outdoors (participant Julian Carrick says he is here to “soothe the soul” and “see the stars”) plus two parents, their eager sons and myself.Some students have dabbled in survival and bushcraft for years – including Karla Pound, a National Geographic expedition leader and contestant on the current season of Alone.View image in fullscreenAlone Australia season 3 contestant Karla Pound joined the course: ‘It is really important to have these basic, fundamental skills under your belt.’Photograph: Rafqa ToumaWe’re not equipped for when things go wrong, she tells me. She says even during common occurrences such as power outages and floods, “people don’t know the first thing to do”.“It is really important to have these basic, fundamental skills under your belt.”The parachute tarp becomes our base for the next four days, with classes held early in the morning and late at night. These hours are by design, to simulate the exhaustion and distraction one might feel in a real survival situation. Meanwhile our days are structured around practical skills.First, knives (I’m limp-wristed and slow), then knots (I actually catch on). We use both to set up our first emergency shelters – pitched plastic sheets strung up between two trees and secured with pegs we carved ourselves, totally open to the surrounds. These structures are called hootchies.View image in fullscreenRafqa Touma with her ‘hootchie’ emergency shelter.Photograph: Rafqa ToumaI am slow to find a spot – too picky, terrified of sleeping near thick shrubbery. It’s a justified fear, I’d say, given we are in the habitat of funnel web spiders, king brown and red belly black snakes.By the time I choose a location, the sun is setting. I fumble in the dark, trying to hold all my ropes and pegs in place. It is only thanks to kind peers – a physio and a former-detective-turned-teacher – that I am able to set up in time for dinner.“The western world has a problem with food aversion,” Dedman says at meal time. So true. I’m hungry for the potato cooking under the bonfire coals we are sitting around.We waste so much, he says, we’re disconnected from our food’s sources. I nod when he mentions more sustainable protein alternatives to beef.Then he brings out a container of live meal worms. We are going to eat them, he says. I laugh. Classic Dedman!My head torch lights up the plump, yellow bodies writhing in the container and visceral anxiety floods my stomach. “Fussy people die.”After several failed attempts, I get the worms into my mouth.They wriggle around my fingers. They thrash against my lips. They burst between my teeth, and the group applauds. I actually enjoy the taste. This will forever be my greatest feat. I am overcome with relief!But Dedman has leftovers.View image in fullscreenPotatoes baking in the fire.Photograph: Rafqa ToumaI was too hesitant, he tells me. I can will myself to do anything, he says. Eat more.I manage to eat a second squirming helping and then Dedman lets me be.

The insects are jumping. My hands are shaking. A course instructor suggests I try breathing.“It’s twitching in the fire!” the 12-year-old observes. I realise if I’m actually caught out in the bush I’ll likely perish because I can’t catch, behead and eat a cricket. An instructor does it for me.Ever since being attacked by a swarm of seagulls on a beach, I’ve been a little jumpy around animals. I start overthinking my impending night’s sleep – what if I wake up to a snake in my sleeping bag?But on a midnight walk to learn celestial navigation before bed, my thoughts are interrupted when we turn off our torches and look up.The air is crisp, the surrounds are silent and the sky glimmers. Fear is replaced by cool, calm peace. I have a great night’s sleep.View image in fullscreenPreparing a hearty meal of kangaroo stew.Photograph: Rafqa ToumaThe next day we learn to make fire with our knife and a ferro rod, and purify creek water. While learning about local flora on a bush walk, Dedman throws impromptu challenges at us – five minutes to gather tinder and kindle and start a fire.All this skill-building has been working us up to the task of our third night – finding an ally or two, scoping out a safe spot and setting up an emergency base. I turn to my new friends Daniel and Damien and we set off, racing against our faux competition who have their sights set on the same campsite.We string up our reflective blankets at a tilt between two trees, light a fire, filter our creek water and prepare a hearty meal of kangaroo stew.View image in fullscreenEmergency shelter for the third night.Photograph: Rafqa ToumaWe eat and chat beneath the night sky and I start to feel a little sad. This place is so beautiful and tomorrow I have to go home.“I mean, just look around you,” Carrick, a peer on the course, said earlier in the day. “This place is heaven right here. You don’t need to look any further.”Wine and wilderness: a multi-day hike in South Australia’s Clare ValleyRead moreHow not to dieDedman’s lessons differ depending on the environment. Here are a few general takeaways for when you are lost or stranded.Mindset is important. Panic is dangerous and can affect those around you. You need to be able to plan, act and hold the will to live.Make sure you think throughyour survival priorities. The rule of threes is governed by what will harm you first: you can survive just three minutes without air, three days without water and three weeks without food.Follow the PLAN acronym: protection (first aid, clothing, shelter, fire), location (attracting, holding and directing attention), acquisition (of water, then food) and navigation (orientation, travel, direction).When going anywhere remote, ensure you can be found. Have a satellite communication device like an EPIRB (emergency position-indicating radiobeacon) on you. Also take stock of everything you have that can attract attention in the natural environment – shiny, bright and reflective materials. You can set these up between trees as a method of passive signalling, fly a bright flag at the end of a big stick, or make a ground-to-air sign with letters. “V” is the international emergency distress symbol. A ground to air sign has to be 6m x 3m to be seen by a passing aerial vehicle or satellite.Search efforts are conducted in patterns. Aircraft will do a box search at the height they can see an animal move. A ground search will follow a track, a river, or man-made things such as telecommunication towers and windmills. Contour searches of mountains are conducted by circling. If you know these patterns, you can set your signalling to capitalise on where you will most likely be seen.Find more in depth advice on theBushcraft Survival Australia blog.The detailsThe three-day fundamentals module 1 course costs $855 for an adult, or $427.50 for a child (aged 12 and up).

The protein from the milk binds to the tannins in the drink, giving it a lovely, silken texture and balancing the alcohol. You’ll need to make the infusion at least five days ahead.Clarified curry leaf daiquiriServes1For the rum infusion20g fresh curry leaves400ml white rum– we useEast London Liquor CoFor the premix400ml curry leaf rum infusion– see above and method50ml overproofrum– we useRon Colón High Proof150ml standard 1:1 grapefruit sugar syrup(ie, equal parts fresh grapefruit juice and sugar)150ml fresh lime juice125ml whole milkFor the drink75ml clarified curry leafdaiquiri– see above and method1 fresh curry leaf, to garnishFor the infusion, put the curry leaves in a half-litre jar, pour over the white rum, seal and leave to infuse for five to seven days, until the leaves lose their colour.Pour all the premix ingredients bar the milk into a large container, and stir. Add the milk, stir gently, then leave to curdle by letting it sit at room temperature for about two hours. Once curdled, strain through cheesecloth set inside a fine-mesh sieve – to start with, it will look cloudy, but after the milk solids settle in the sieve, it will start to strain through clear. The moment it does so, move the sieve over a second container and pour the cloudy initial pour back in to strain again. Decant into clean bottles or jars, seal and refrigerate.To serve, pour the clarified daiquiri over ice in a tumbler, stir to chill and dilute, and garnish with a curry leaf.Edward Sims, bar manager,Don’t Tell Dad, London NW6Explore more on these topicsCocktailsThe good mixerSpiritsFoodrecipesShareReuse this content"

I’m not normally one to jump on to viral trends, but I couldn’t resist trying this one. The dough is pretty easy, with no kneading or stand mixer required – just some stretching, folding and plenty of time to rest. You end up with something that tastes like a cinnamon bun/doughnut hybrid, that’s not too sweet and with a little more chew.Glazed cinnamon focacciaPrep5 minProve3 hr+Cook1 hr 15 minServes12-16For the dough450g breadflour7g instant yeast2 tbsp sugar1 tsp fine sea salt30ml olive oil, plus extra for greasingFor the cinnamon sugar3½ tsp cinnamon50g caster sugar50g unsalted butter,meltedFor the glaze3 tbsp icing sugar¼ tsp cinnamon2 tspwhole milkA pinch of saltPut the flour, yeast, sugar, and salt in the bowl of a stand mixer, and mix to combine. Make a well in the centre, pour in 360ml lukewarm water and the olive oil, and mix briefly to make a shaggy dough.Still in the bowl, and using a slightly wet hand, pull one corner of the dough from underneath, stretch and fold it to the centre, then turn the dough 90 degrees. Repeat the stretch, fold and turn three more times.Cover the bowl with clingfilm or a damp tea towel, and leave to rest for 30 minutes. Repeat the stretch and fold process, let it rest for another 30 minutes, then stretch and fold repeat again.In a small bowl, mix the cinnamon and sugar. Sprinkle half of this on top of the dough, then do one more set of stretch and folds. Sprinkle a little more cinnamon sugar on top, then cover the dough and prove for an hour to an hour and a half, until nearly doubled in size.Generously grease a 30cm x 22cm baking tin with olive oil, then tip in the dough. Using your fingertips, gently stretch out the dough to fill the pan (don’t worry if it springs back), then cover and put in a warm place and leave to rest for another 30 minutes.Heat the oven to 230C (210C fan)/450F/gas 8. Pour the melted butter on to the surface of the dough and sprinkle with the remaining cinnamon sugar. Use your fingertips to dimple the dough, then bake for 20-25 minutes, until well browned and puffy. Remove from the oven and cool for 10 minutes.Make the glaze by mixing the icing sugar, cinnamon, milk and salt. Drizzle this generously over the warm focaccia and serve.Explore more on these topicsBakingThe sweet spotFoodDessertCakeBreadItalian food and drinkSnacksrecipesShareReuse this content"

It works especially well with Tesco Finest Signature sausages, which are made with British pork and seasoned with herbs and spices to enhance their succulent flavour, and orecchiette, a small ear-shaped pasta made from durum wheat. This pasta is particularly good for catching pockets of the delicious sauce – a combination of sundried tomato pesto rosso, fennel, and Tesco Finest sugarbelle tomatoes, which are bursting with sweet flavour. These few high-quality ingredients make this pasta feel extra special.Prep10 minCook45 minServes42 tbsp Tesco Finest Sicilian extra virgin olive oil,plus extra to serve4 Tesco Finest Signature pork sausages1 fennel bulb,thinly sliced and green fronds reserved1 garlic clove,crushed1⁄2tbsp fennel seeds,crushed1⁄2tsp chilli flakes220g Tesco Finest sugarbelle tomatoes,halved350g Tesco Finest orecchiette4 tbsp Tesco Finest sundried tomato pesto rossoBig handful fresh basil,chopped, plus extra to serveTesco Finest parmigiano reggiano,to serveSuggested wine pairingTesco Finest primitivoBuy nowView image in fullscreenHeat 1 tbsp of the olive oil in a large, non-stick frying pan or shallow casserole dish. Squeeze the sausage meat out of the skins and into the pan and break the meat into bite-size nuggets. Fry over a medium heat for 8-10 minutes or until golden brown. Once cooked, scoop out with a slotted spoon and transfer to a bowl.Using the same pan, add the remaining olive oil, sliced fennel and a pinch of salt. Fry gently over a low-medium heat for 15 minutes or until softened. Add the garlic, fennel seeds and chilli and fry for 2 minutes. Tip in the tomatoes and fry for 7-8 minutes or until popping and softened.Bring a large pan of salted water to the boil. Add the orecchiette and cook according to packet instructions. Reserve 200ml of the starchy pasta cooking water then drain away the rest.Add the pesto to the pan of fennel and tomatoes along with the cooked sausage meat, pasta and 150ml of the pasta water. Toss together until the pasta is coated in a glossy sauce. Add a splash more water if it seems a little dry.
