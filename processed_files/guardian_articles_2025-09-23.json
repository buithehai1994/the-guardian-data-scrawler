A year ago in Bournemouth they had appeared to be caught in the spotlight of their own electoral success. Unsure quite where they would go next. At times the conference speeches had been almost apologetic. New MPs blinking as they were pushed on to the main stage, unknown even to themselves.Twelve months on there is a confidence to the party. Their 72 MPs have all settled quite comfortably into Westminster and rather enjoy the attention. They are bullish about the future. There are no worries about losing their seats at the next election. Rather they see 2024 as a springboard for a brighter future. Looking to take more seats off the Tories as well as taking chunks out of Labour in the red wall.Branding themselves the real opposition to Reform. A key player in any centre-left coalition.Whether this confidence is misplaced or not is another matter. Prof John Curticereckonsthe Lib Dems have just about maxed out their gains in their current iteration and will need to reinvent themselves in the next few years. But for now the party seems happy enough with the way things are at their annual conference this September. They think things are falling into place. Even down to Donald Trump making a speech to the UN at the same time as Ed Davey was giving his leader’s speech.Call it synchronicity. Call it luck. Either way, it suited Ed just fine. Over in New York there was the US president unapologetically dismissing the UN. Telling European leaderstheir countries were going to hell. Making no mention of the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. Rubbishing green energy and the climate crisis. Declaring London was under sharia law with Sadiq Khan. All music to Davey’s ears. Why interrupt an enemy when he’s telling you who he is? Let Labour and the Conservatives try to explain all this away. They are the ones who have been sucking up to the Sun Bed God.So, these are also Happy Days for Ed. While Keir Starmer and Kemi Badenoch can feel the wagons circling, Davey has no immediate rivals for his job. Sure, there are always the odd moans that Ed hasn’t cut through enough but no one is gunning to replace him. Right now, he’s as safe as a leader can be until the other side of an election. The Lib Dems are more or less united behind him. They speak with one voice. For those in search of resentments and disagreements, the last few days inBournemouthhave been a massive disappointment.And yet Ed’s closing speech somehow all just felt a bit too cosy. Davey may have been working on turning his Mr Nice Guy image into a Mr Not-Quite-So-Nice Guy with his attacks on the BBC for its Reform coverage, but he seemed mostly happy to play his Greatest Hits. To tell the conference what he thought it wanted to hear. Not to challenge it to follow his lead into new directions.But perhaps it’s too early for that. Maybe now is the time just to enjoy the moment. To watch the Tories and Labour struggle. An election is probably at least three years off and the hard stuff can come later. Yet you could sense a slight disconnection in the audience. As if they all knew this was a performance for the news bulletins that didn’t really mean much and they could afford to disengage.The applause came at the right moments in the gaps marked “Applause” but rarely felt spontaneous or heartfelt. Just loyal party members doing what was expected of them. You could tell the difference. Because when Ed talked about a genocide in Gaza and the recognition of the State of Palestine, that’s when the noise cranked up. That’s what the conference really cared about. Even an adorable guide dog joined in with some loud barks. He deserves a solo slot on the main stage next year.Fresh from a game of beach cricket – very on brand – Ed had taken to the stage with a backdrop of all his MPs. It was going to be a long afternoon for those not allocated a chair and forced to stand throughout. After a brief warm up, we got to the nitty gritty. The Tories and Labour were in trouble. Though interestingly Davey took the credit for free school lunches and support for carers that were Labour policies. But both the two main parties had lost the country’s trust.He invited their supporters to give him an even break.So it was a choice between the Lib Dems and Reform. Or rather “Trump’s America reshaped into Farage’s Britain”. That was to become a refrain throughout the speech. Ed even took a leaf out of the Reform playbook and just made things up when it suited him. Like claiming Nige still wanted to relax gun controls in this country. Even Nige knows that one’s not a vote winner this side of the Atlantic.But the Donald was the gift that kept on giving for Davey. Only on Monday, Trump had gone into one of his stream of unconsciousnessrants about paracetamol causing autismin pregnant women, quickly followed by one about the virtues of the anti-vaxxers. Almost as if he were hell-bent on killing children. Something that’s hard for Nige to distance himself from after his own health spokesperson used his Reform conference slot to say it was theroyals’ own fault for getting canceras they had been given the Covid vaccine. Ed accepted this open goal gratefully. Even extending an invitation to US scientists tocontinue their research over here.Whose side were you on, Davey asked: Trump, Putin or Farage? Or fish and chips and cricket pavilions. The real Britain. A Britain of tolerance and decency. It all felt a bit cliched. Is it too much to ask of our politicians that they can speak in less binary terms. Treat us as adults. Then a brief mention of Brexit. An almost apologetic suggestion we rejoined the single market and the customs union before the final, underwhelming peroration. Cue golden confetti falling from the ceilings. It was job done. It may not have been the most uplifting of occasions. But Labour and the Tories will be lucky if theirs go half as well.Explore more on these topicsPoliticsThe politics sketchLiberal DemocratsLiberal Democrat conferenceEd DaveyBournemouthcommentShareReuse this content"

He claimed it raises the chances of children being autistic.But the US president has beencondemned by experts from across the world, who fear he is deliberately fostering a narrative of distrust that could be dangerous for women.So what does the scienceactuallysay?Does paracetamol cause autism?The short answer is: no. Genetics plays a major role in autism, but scientists are also investigating the potential role of environmental factors such as parental age, premature birth and prenatal exposure to drugs, environmental chemicals or infections.“The idea that something that occurs during pregnancy may influence neurodevelopment isn’t a particularly new or crazy or outlandish idea,” said Renee Gardner, an associate professor of epidemiology at Sweden’s Karolinska Institute. “We know there’s a large heritable or familial influence, but environment interacts with genetic tendencies.”Paracetamol has been widely used for pain relief since the 1950s and is recommended by the NHS as the first choice of painkiller if you are pregnant. In recent years,a number of studieshave suggested that women who take paracetamol during pregnancy are very slightly more likely to have a child who is diagnosed with autism. But this does not prove that the link is causal and agencies such as the UK’s Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) have stated there is no evidence that taking paracetamol during pregnancy causes autism in children.Why do some studies suggest a link between paracetamol and autism?A big challenge in human studies is working out what genuinely contributes to autism and what is simply associated with the condition.“Lots of potential risk factors for autism have been investigated and when you are doing this kind of research, it can be very difficult to disentangle what is truly a cause,” said Prof Laurie Tomlinson, professor of clinical epidemiology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. “People taking paracetamol or not taking paracetamol in pregnancy may be different in many ways.”For example, older women are more likely to have autistic children, but they are also more likely to have aches and pains and medical conditions that call for painkillers.Similarly, particular medical conditions are biologically connected with autism. For example, women with hypermobility have loose and stretchy ligaments that mean their joints have an unusually large range of motion. They are also more likely to have autistic children. Pregnancy can cause worse joint pain in women with hypermobility, making them more likely to take painkillers. If studies do not fully account for these factors, painkillers can wrongly appear to be a risk factor.Gardner and colleagues ledthe largest study to date on autism and paracetamol use during pregnancy, using health records of 2.4 million children born in Sweden between 1995 and 2019. They found that about 1.5% of children whose mothers were prescribed paracetamol during pregnancy were autistic, compared with 1.3% of children whose mothers were not prescribed the drug.However, when the researchers compared outcomes between siblings – removing genetics from the equation – the association between autism and paracetamol use disappeared completely. “Some of the same genetic tendencies that increase people’s risk of autism are overlapping with genes that influence immune response and pain perception, which are all things that might increase use of paracetamol,” said Gardner.The researchers concluded there was no evidence to support a causal link and another Japanese study, published earlier this year, reached a similar verdict.Why are autism rates rising?Forty years ago, about four to six people in every 10,000 had an autism diagnosis. Today, depending on the country, the rate is somewhere between 1% and 3%. Diagnosis has increased in adults as well as young children. Trump’s health secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr, has described the increase as an “epidemic”, a word better reserved for infectious disease outbreaks.Many researchers believe the rise is because of doctors casting a wider net when diagnosing autism, greater awareness, and clinics improving diagnosis, rather than an increase in autism itself. But it is possible that as-yet undiscovered environmental factors have also contributed.“A much broader range of behaviours were brought under the umbrella of the term autism,” said Prof Gina Rippon, emeritus professor of cognitive neuroimaging at Aston University. “What looked like a dramatic increase in cases was a dramatic increase in diagnosis.”“The whole impression is that this is a disease that needs curing or eradicating,” she added. “It’s putting aside the huge advantages of the creativity and inventiveness of people who think about the world in a different way. To paint it as an epidemic or disease is very demeaning to the autistic community.”1:54Autism expert says Trump’s Tylenol claims ‘aren't based in fact’ – videoTrump’s comments ‘feed a narrative of distrust … which is really dangerous for women’The best evidence does not support the claim that paracetamol contributes to autism, but Trump’s comments will still have a wide impact. One immediate effect will be more pain and misery for women in pregnancy, with potential health risks.“When Trump suggests that there’s no downside to not taking paracetamol during pregnancy, that’s not true,” said Gardner. “There’s quite a big body of evidence that shows that there are potentially severe health risks if a fever goes untreated for a prolonged period of time during pregnancy.”There is also a broader undermining of trust in science and the medical establishment. “Pregnant women are already bombarded with a host of unsubstantiated information,” said Prof Sarah Hawkes, the co-founder of Global Health 50/50, a gender equality research initiative. “It feeds into a narrative of distrust in science, which is really dangerous for women’s health, particularly in pregnancy.”For parents of autistic children, Hawkes added, “you’ve introduced a huge amount of stigma and guilt when the scientific evidence just doesn’t bear that out”.There is a risk to women’s mental health, too. Prof Shakila Thangaratinam, professor of women’s health at the University of Liverpool, said the advice was likely to make women more anxious while pregnant and after childbirth. “Women could spend the next 10 years unnecessarily worrying,” she said.Given the power and influence that US health institutions have had as standard-setting agencies, advice issued by the FDA is likely to have consequences around the world. In some countries, paracetamol is the primary painkiller given in childbirth. If doctors or pregnant women avoid the painkiller, it could lead to more post-traumatic stress disorder and to more women seeking caesarean sections.“Paracetamol is far and away the safest painkiller in pregnancy so if women are more reluctant to take it they are going to be suffering unnecessarily,” said Tomlinson. “In general, women are very cautious about taking anything during pregnancy.”What will change in the US?TheUS Food and Drug Administration is changing the labelon Tylenol to warn of a “possible association” between autism and taking the drug in pregnancy. It has also alerted physicians nationally. The agency makes clear that a causal relationship between Tylenol and autism has not been established. It also notes that it is the only drug approved to treat fever in pregnancy and high fever can be risky for babies in the womb.But experts are concerned that Trump’s less measured instruction to “fight like hell not to take it” may be what ends up sticking in the minds of many patients.“Can you imagine having to sit there and weigh the decision?” said Gardner. “Your doctor may be telling you it’s safe to use, but the bold words on the packaging say this could cause harm to your unborn baby. That’s a terrible position to put parents into.”The FDA also moved to approve a drug called leucovorin, a form of folate, amid research that suggests it may improve some of the social communication difficulties autistic people can experience.Explore more on these topicsAutismDonald TrumpRobert F Kennedy JrHealthPregnancyParents and parentingWomenexplainersShareReuse this content"

(Spoiler: it happened again.) “For starters, Mr Epstein has hired a full-time male masseur (the man happens to be a former Ultimate Fighting champion). He has also organised what he calls a board of directors of friends to counsel him on his behaviour.”Dearie me. Maybe that’s what his friend Prince Andrew was doing in the famous photo of them walking in Central Park two years later, bundled up against the New York cold and an approaching tornado of sex-abuse allegations? Although, hang on, because that was the four-day house visit that Andrew said he’d made to break off contact for ever with Epstein. “I took the decision that I had to show leadership,”he boastedto Emily Maitlis, “and I had to go and tell him: that’s it.” As most people wondered of the dim-witted old sleazebucket when that Newsnight interview came out: could you not have done it on the phone instead? But then, of course he couldn’t, because this was not actually the end of contact at all. An email from a few months later hasalready surfaced, sent from Epstein to what the UK Financial Conduct Authority redact as a “member of the British royal family”, looking to set up a meeting between said royal and thesince-disgraced former Barclays bossJes Staley. The response from the “member of the British royal family” was: “Keep in close touch and we’ll play some more soon!!!” Look, maybe it was Princess Anne.The trouble with being thick and telling this many lies is that you can never remember which one you’ve told. This is certainly the situation Andrew’s former wife, Duchess Fergie, finds herself in this week, as some of her own emails to Epstein have surfaced, and have promptly detonatedher 2011 statementto the Evening Standard that, “I abhor paedophilia and any sexual abuse of children and know that this was a gigantic error of judgment on my behalf. I am just so contrite I cannot say.” Fergie promised to “have nothing ever to do with Jeffrey Epstein ever again”. We now discover it was just weeks before she was writing privately to Epstein saying she never said all the things she definitely said.Charities are dropping her left, right and centre, but what else can they do? “I know you feel hellaciously let down by me from what you were either told or read and I must humbly apologise to you and your heart for that,”Fergie fawnsin one email to Epstein. “You have always been a steadfast, generous and supreme friend to me and my family. As you know, I did not, absolutely not, say the ‘P word’ about you …” Absurd to find her too prim to even type the word “paedophile”, though not to be supreme friends with someone who had literally been to prison for soliciting minors.Epstein had given her money, of course. She says fifteen grand. Then again, she says a lot of things. The duchess’s debts werereported to be £5mat the time, because she has always spent money – other people’s money – like water. Has she claimed this longterm trait was a mental illness yet? I wouldn’t rule that out in the coming months. For now, her team are saying of these excruciating Epstein emails: “Like many people, she was taken in by his lies” – a virtual cut-and-paste of Peter Mandelson’s claim a couple of weeks ago that he regrets “being taken in by [Epstein] as many other people do”.The more I think about this fashionable line of defence, the more bizarre I find it. If I had a wildly rich and incredibly connected friend, and they still ended up going to prison for 18 months – even with the most shit-hot rottweiler lawyers (Alan Dershowitz and Kenneth Starr!); even under the US’s grotesque plea bargaining system – then I would simply assume this friend had done the thing they were convicted of, and most probably much worse. It’s called being realistic. Do we truly believe that stretched local Florida police forces have the time or inclination to confect whole cases, spend years of asymmetric legal wrangling trying to push them over the line, get done over by a plea deal that bumps the case back down to state level and seals it, and do it all as part of some envious conspiracy? No. No way on earth. Any conspiracy ran the other way. “This was not a ‘he said, she said’ situation,” thepolice chief who led the probe saidruefully after the stitch-up. “This was 50-something ‘shes’ and one ‘he’ – and the ‘shes’ all basically told the same story.’’skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

That culture was everywhere before feminism | Rebecca SolnitRead moreI’m not saying everyone in the world should have known this about Epstein back in 2008 – so many sex cases, so little time – and there was no reason most people would even have heard of him at this stage. But any close friend of his would have been following the reports. Any of them who didn’t assume the grim reality just chose not to, out of moral cowardice, personal greed, staggeringly wilful blindness or sociopathic indifference. The end.Epstein obviously cast things differently. In his nutty NYT interview, he “likened himself to Gulliver shipwrecked among the diminutive denizens of Lilliput. ‘Gulliver’s playfulness had unintended consequences,’ Mr Epstein said. ‘That is what happens with wealth. There are unexpected burdens as well as benefits.’”Do me a favour. And yet Fergie herself has played a version of this tiny violin for decades, and will again now she has been found out, again. Her victim narrative has been surprisingly durable, even though she has helped burn through more fortunes than almost every other person on this planet will ever see:£20m chaletsin Verbier; the£15m mucky mansion; houses she never even moved into; eternal luxury holidays; endless retinues of unnecessary staff … she has pulled in more than some of her charities ever will. How many of her financial empires have fallen, only for a new one to rise again when someKazakh oligarch/sex Gulliver/other mysterious billionaire conveniently turns up in the nick of time to buy her out or bail her out? The king is still doing it, probably dreading the deeper liability of her being outside the tent. It’s unclear quite how long that will be able to hold if further emails between Prince Andrew and Epstein emerge, as seems a distinct possibility.Whatever happens, however, this is not victimhood. I’m sure one of Epstein’s actual victims could explain the difference.Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Do you have a full 11? Do you have subs on the bench?.”Football analogies are generally rare at events about parenting, particularly those that seek to tackle gender equality. But then, so are men. At the Working Dads’ summit – almost certainly the first in the UK – both were in plentiful supply, as fathers were urged to “create a new idea of masculinity”.Rae, founder of the network Parenting Out Loud, which organised the event, urged fathers to start a “new national conversation about working dads”.View image in fullscreen‘We are creating a new idea of masculinity,’ said Elliott Rae.Photograph: Jill Mead/The Guardian“We are creating a new idea of masculinity. A new model for what it means to be a man and a dad,” he told the several hundred attenders on Tuesday, who were joined by another 2,000 online.“In the face of increased far-right rhetoric, and some businesses rolling back D&I [diversity and inclusion] initiatives and demanding their employees come back into the office full-time … our voices need to be louder.”Rae said it was time for dads to be “loud and proud” about their parenting responsibilities, encouraging them to take all parental leave available to them, have an open calendar and be honest when they had to miss a meeting because of school drop-off or pickup.He appealed to men and women to work together to push for more equal parenting, arguing that it was vital to combat the motherhood penalty, which recent analysis of Office for National Statistics data suggested contributes to women with childrenearning a third less per weekand 20% less an hour than men with children. Noting that men account for aboutthree-quarters of suicidesin the UK, he argued that men involved in childcare were also less stressed and happier with their lives. “It’s not a competition, it’s not a zero-sum game,” he said. “It’s a win-win for everyone.”View image in fullscreenA mother and baby in the audience look on.Photograph: Jill Mead/The GuardianThe summit will put further pressure on the government to improve the UK’s paternity leave offering, which was ranked40th out of 43 in an international comparisonbased on Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development figures. Last week the Commons women and equalities select committee called its failure to commit to improving the UK’s paternity pay and leave during the current parliament “disappointing”.A government review of the UK’s parental leave system,which launched in July, was a “watershed moment” said MPs, but “tinkering around the edges of a broken system will let down working parents”, they said.View image in fullscreenAudience members at the event.Photograph: Jill Mead/The GuardianSpeaking at the event, the Labour MP Stella Creasy warned that Labour’s flagshipemployment rights billcould, by giving women better maternity rights, perversely result in more maternity discrimination in the short term. This could be combated by equalising parental leave, she said: “Changing the law on parental rights so that every parent can be present is about every parent being equally discriminated against.”The summit is a significant marker in a year when growing numbers of men have joined women’s voices in calling for better paternity leave in a bid to tackle entrenched inequality. In June, hundreds of fathers took to the streets to demand better paternity leave inthe first ever “Dad strikes”in London and Edinburgh.New campaign groupThe Dad Shift, which organised the protest, have also rallied a new group ofpredominantly male Labour MPs, many with seats in “red wall” constituencies, who are putting internal pressure on the government to appeal to men directly.View image in fullscreenA panel discussion at the summit.Photograph: Jill Mead/The Guardian“It does feel like this is a moment, it’s part of the zeitgeist,” said attender Oliver Daniels, a father of one who works for the childcare platform Bubble. He pointed to the coronavirus pandemic, credited with causing an 18% increase in the amount of timefathers spend looking after their children, as a turning point in the conversation.“Dads suddenly found it wasn’t just that they could be more involved parents, but that they wanted to be,” he said.A spokesperson said the government was committed to supporting parents to balance work and home and was making paternity leave a day-one right through the employment rights bill. “We know the parental leave system needs to be improved and are carrying out a review to ensure it best supports working families,” they said.Explore more on these topicsMenParents and parentingWomenFamilyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Here goes: how many sitting Democratic members of Congress have died in office since November 2022? The answer is a mind-boggling eight. While Republicans aren’t dropping dead at the same rate, they’re arguably clinging to power for longer than is dignified. Last year, a Texas journalist discoveredKay Granger, a high-ranking octogenarian Republican congresswoman, had stopped coming to work because she was in a senior living facility, suffering from “dementia issues”. And while he is not in a facility yet, Donald Trump’snonsensical ramblings, including a recent weird and completely fictitious story abouthis uncle knowing the Unabomber, suggest he may be suffering some sort of issue with his mental acuity.I’m not trying to be ageist here (the older I get, the more worried I become about ageism). I’m simply setting the scene. Behold: the US is ruled by out-of-touch elites who would rather die at their desks than cede power to fresh blood. Meanwhile, many Americans are frustrated with thestatus quoand desperate for change. You can see this in the excitement around Zohran Mamdani, the incoming Democratic mayor of New York City – unless thebillionaire classcan pull off an upset. You can also see it in arecent pollthat found more than half of likely Democratic voters prefer socialism-aligned politicians such as Bernie Sanders (who, to be fair, is 84), Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (AOC) and Mamdani to establishment figures like Hakeem Jeffries, Nancy Pelosi and Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer.Ocasio-Cortez and her team can certainly see it, and they appear to be poised to seize this political moment. Rumours are swirling that the 35-year-old congresswoman is considering a run for president or the Senate in 2028. The latter move would probably mean facing off against Schumer, who is about as old-guard as you can get and hasnot yet endorsed Mamdani. If AOC beat him (whichpolls showis very plausible), it would be a massive shift for the future of the Democratic party. A presidential nomination, however, is obviously the real prize.The US doesn’t have a great record when it comes to rallying behind female presidential candidates. Is there really a chance that the first Madam President could come in the form of a millennial progressive?Ocasio-Cortez, whose charisma took her from obscurity to a household name in record speed, certainly should not be underestimated. Even Trump has expressed grudging admiration for the congresswoman. “She’s got a little spunk … a little something that’s good,” he toldFox News on Sunday, in reference to an Axios report about AOC’s ambitions. But he added: “I don’t think her philosophy can come close to winning.”Please don’t succumb to hopelessness over Palestine. Your voice can still make a difference | Arwa MahdawiRead moreIt’s not entirely clear, however, what AOC’s “philosophy” is these days. When a 28-year-old Ocasio-Cortezunseated longtime incumbentJoe Crowley in a New York primary election in 2018, she was unapologetically leftwing. “Working-class Americans want a clear champion and there is nothing radical about moral clarity in 2018,” she stated.Since then, the political machine has wrung some of that clarity out of the congresswoman. “AOC is just a regular Democrat now,” New York magazine lamented in a2023 piecethat charted what some of her base see as a shift to the centre. Last year shelost the endorsementof the national leadership of the Democratic Socialists of America because of her equivocation over Palestine.While AOC is one of the few US politicians to have termed the situation in Gaza a genocide, she has also disappointed many pro-Palestine progressives (including me) with her laundering of the Biden-Harris administration’s blank cheque to Israel. During herprimetime slotat the Democratic National Convention, for example (where no Palestinian Americans were invited to speak on the main stage), AOC repeated Kamala Harris’s refrain that she was “working tirelessly to secure a ceasefire in Gaza”. Which wasn’t entirely a lie: you’re not going to get tired when you’re doing absolutely nothing to stop a bloodbath, are you?But beggars can’t be choosers. There is no perfect saviour coming to rescue us from the hellscape that is US politics. Indeed, the way things are going, it’snot even a giventhat there will be free and fair elections in 2028. We must coalesce around whoever is best placed to chart a way out of Trumpism. And AOC, for all her flaws, has the sort of fight that is needed. I hope that she is not written off as too left or too right or too female before she has a chance to get started.Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsAlexandria Ocasio-CortezOpinionDemocratsZohran MamdaniUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

In April, searches on Pinterest searches were up 240% for“unique wedding dresses”, with those looking for blush pink wedding dresses up 60% and black dresses up 50%.With some brides opting to forego the classic look, six women tell us about their colorful dresses and what inspired them to go against the grain.Kitty, 32, Leeds, UKView image in fullscreenKitty with her husband Dom on their wedding day.Photograph: Alt Wedding CoSource:ASOSPrice: £110 (about $149)Designer: ASOS DesignFor Kitty, 32, though she liked a traditional white wedding dress it just wasn’t for her. “I chose red as I’ve always been a fan of alternative style and while a gorgeous white gown is a beloved classic for a reason, it just didn’t feel right on me,” she said.Inspired by the use of red in Asian weddings, Kitty, who lives in Leeds, UK, and works in software implementation, wanted a dress color that was “loud”. She chose the “simple” dress from ASOS Design and bought a crown fromCarbickova Crownsand a veil fromHolly Winter Couture.“I’ve been lucky enough through travel and growing up in Birmingham to see lots of other cultures’ wedding traditions first-hand, and red features often in both east and south Asian bridal wear. I’ve always found it so striking and beautiful so I wanted to respectfully incorporate that into my wedding.”Anne, 47, Sheffield, UKSource: HandmadePrice: £200 (about $270)View image in fullscreenAnne wearing her handmade wedding dress.Photograph: Kari BellamyAnne from Sheffield in the UK has always liked colorful clothes and knew that her wedding dress was going to be the “brightest thing” she could imagine. While looking for inspiration she came across theLa Chimère collection by Thierry Muglerand fell in love.“I scoured charity shops for sparkly clothing I could cut up, and sewed thousands of scales together to make a corset, skirt and jacket,” said the 47-year-old civil servant.“It took eight months to make and has scales made by family, my son and includes snippets of my late mother’s clothing, so it ended up being a bit of an artwork as well as an outfit. I adored wearing it.”Kate, 38, Richmond, VirginiaSource:La NovalePrice: Just under $600 (about £440)View image in fullscreenKate wearing her silver wedding dress.Photograph: Jake Cunningham/Courage + Co Photography“I’ve never quite felt like I look my best in white,” said Kate, 38, from Richmond, Virginia, who is pleased she let go of the notion of getting a white wedding dress early on in her search.Before she was engaged, she started looking at examples of silver wedding dresses and stumbled across La Novale on Etsy, a Ukrainian boutique based in Odesa. “I knew it was the right choice for me,” said Kate, who works as a data analyst. “I tried on several traditional white options with my mom, but we both thought this one felt more authentic to my style and personality.“Silver felt fun and festive but also bold and modern while still seeming bridal. My husband, Austin, and I were married at an art museum and I think it also really complimented the venue.”Hanneke, 53, Grays, Essex, UKView image in fullscreenHanneke wearing her orange wedding dress.Photograph: Bert Jonkhans FotografieSource: HandmadePrice: £225 (about $305)It was 53-year-old Hanneke’s second marriage when she married Nigel so she didn’t want to wear white. Instead, she chose orange as “a clear reference to my Dutch heritage” and decided to make her wedding dress herself.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWell ActuallyFree weekly newsletterPractical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good lifeEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

As we planned for all the men to wear morning suits with different colored cravats, I had to be careful in steering my husband towards wearing a non-clashing color.“My Dutch family and friends loved the dress and my British friends thought it was a daring but fitting choice. I looked and felt like a million bucks.”Jasmine, 34, Vancouver, CanadaView image in fullscreenJasmine wearing her floral wedding dress.Photograph: Nomo Akisawa/Simply Sweet PhotographySource:Saks Fifth AvenuePrice: $2,500 CAD (about $1,813 USD and £1,334)Designer:Marchesa NotteFor Jasmine and her husband, Michael, in Vancouver, Canada, their original plan was to get married in Tuscany, Italy, in May 2020 but the Covid pandemic meant that wasn’t possible.“The original intention was to wear this dress to the welcome dinner,” said the 34-year-old who works in real estate finance. “We instead pivoted and had a small, beautiful back yard ceremony in my parents’ home where I grew up.”Jasmine was drawn to the floral design of the dress, designed by Marchesa Notte, and thought the light peach color would work well with her skin tone. “Our wedding took place in spring and the dress epitomized everything I love about the beautiful blooms of that time of year.”Q, 55, OregonView image in fullscreenQ walking with her dad to the wedding venue.Photograph: QSource: Local seamstressPrice: $700 (about £520)Designer: DianeWith only four weeks to find a wedding dress, Q, 55, was “nervous” about how she would get one in time. “I had defaulted to a plain white pantsuit, but when I put it on I felt uninspired,” said the compliance and risk professional from Oregon.Feeling it was too late to order a wedding dress, she spotted a small sign offering alterations on a bulletin board at Stumptown Coffee, a local coffee shop. “I took the chance and met Diane – I can’t recall her last name – and she was lovely.”They went fabric shopping and found an “amazing dark green that shimmered chartreuse and had silver embroidery”. Despite not starting out thinking she specifically wanted a green dress, Q knew it was the color for her.“There had been a photo in a Martha Stewart magazine in which several women had similar long skirts and wraps, but in different colors. I had thought that it was an elegant solution in which the same outfit could be worn again and mix-and-match a top depending on weather. My wedding was 24 years ago and I’ve worn it over a dozen times at various formal events.”Explore more on these topicsWell actuallyWedding dressesWeddingsDressesDresses for weddingsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Why not?”Trump added: “Russia has been fighting aimlessly for three and a half years, a war that should have taken a Real Military Power less than a week to win.”map showing Russian-held territory in Ukraine and its recent and claimed advances in the border regionsThe US president said this was not making Russia look distinguished, but instead a paper tiger, pointing to the long queues for petrol inside the country. He added: “Putin and Russia are in BIG Economic trouble, and this is the time forUkraineto act.” He also promised “to supply weapons to Nato for Nato to do what they want with them”.Zelenskyy hailed Trump’s intervention, saying it represented a “big shift” from the US president. He added that he thought Trump could help change the Chinese president Xi Jinping’s stance on Russia’s war in Ukraine.Earlier, Trump said that he planned to enforce his demand that Nato countries stop importing Russian oil – including Hungary, led by his close allyViktor Orbán.Inhis speech to the UN general assemblythe US president renewed his demand for Europe to end its “embarrassing” purchase of oil and gas from Russia, saying until it did so he would not impose his long-promised economic punishment on Moscow.Trump also said he believed Nato aircraftshould shoot down Russian aircraftif they entered its airspace, but later qualified his remarks by saying it depended on the circumstances.He made his remarksalongside Zelenskyy, whom he described as a “brave man”. Asked if he still trusted the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, Trump said he would know in a month’s time.It came after the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, had given less wholehearted support for shooting down Russian planes in Nato airspace, saying this should only happen “if they’re attacking”.View image in fullscreenThe Lukoil refinery in Volgograd. Donald Trump said European countries must end their ‘embarrassing’ purchase of oil and gas from Russia.Photograph: ReutersIn his speech to the UN Trump mocked Nato allies’ failure to curb oil imports, saying: “China and India are the primary funders of the ongoing war by continuing to purchase Russian oil. But inexcusably, even Nato countries have not cut off much Russian energy and Russian energy products … I found out about it two weeks ago, and I wasn’t happy.“They’re funding the war against themselves. Who the hell ever heard of that one? In the event that Russia is not ready to make a deal to end the war, then the United States is fully prepared to impose a very strong round of powerful tariffs.“But for those tariffs to be effective, European nations, all of you … gathered here right now, would have to join us in adopting the exact same measures.”Trump did not specify the measures, but he has been stalling on a package that includes tariffs against countries that do business with Russia, such as India and China. He has already imposed 50% tariffs on India, but is also in the middle of negotiations that could see those lifted.Regarding Orbán, the Hungarian prime minister, Trump said: “He’s a friend of mine. I have not spoken to him [about importing Russian oil], but I have a feeling if I did, he might stop, and I think I’ll be doing that.”In response to Trump’s demands, the EU is trying to bring forward the date by which it ends the import of liquid natural gas imports from Russia to 2026 – a year earlier than planned. The EU is opposed to imposing vast tariffs on China or India, but is looking at more targeted measures against Indian and Chinese oil refineries.Trump said he would be discussing the issue with EU leaders, adding: “They can’t be doing what they’re doing. They’re buying oil and gas from Russia while they’re fighting Russia … They have to immediately cease all energy purchases from Russia. Otherwise, we are all wasting a lot of time.”The EU’s 19th sanctions package also proposes export controls on another 45 companies that are deemed to be cooperating on sanctions evasion. Those include 12 Chinese, two Thai and three Indian entities that have enabled Russia to circumvent the bloc’s sanctions.View image in fullscreenThe Druzhba oil pipeline between Hungary and Russia at the Danube refinery in Szazhalombatta, Hungary.Photograph: Bernadett Szabó/ReutersHungary’s foreign minister, Péter Szijjártó, told the Guardian thatHungary could not wean itself off Russian energy supplies. He said: “We can’t ensure the safe supply [of energy products] for our country without Russian oil or gas sources,” while adding that he “understood” Trump’s approach.“For us, energy supplies are a purely physical question,” he said. “It can be nice to dream about buying oil and gas from somewhere [besides Russia] … but we can only buy from where we have infrastructure. And if you look at the physical infrastructure, it’s obvious that without the Russian supplies, it is impossible to ensure the safe supply of the country.”Budapest relies on the Druzhba oil pipeline and the TurkStream gas pipeline to receive Russian hydrocarbons.Slovakia, the second EU country still importing Russian oil, said it had already spoken to the US about the issue, and received a sympathetic response. “As long as we have an alternative route, and the transmission capacity is sufficient,Slovakiahas no problem diversifying,” said the economy minister, Denisa Saková.Hungary and Slovakia are the two countries that have most frequently called for the EU to reduce its support for Ukraine.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpUkraineOilRussiaNatoTrump tariffsUS foreign policynewsShareReuse this content"

A Reform source denied it was party policy, calling the Lib Dems “an irrelevant laughing stock”.“Trump’s America. Don’t let it become Farage’s Britain,” Davey said in a refrain he repeated several times.The speech included passing condemnation of the Conservatives, with Davey saying his party aimed to win more seats than them at the next election, and at Labour and Keir Starmer, who he again called “continuity Sunak”.But a large section was focused on Farage, with Davey arguing it was the Lib Dems’ responsibility to stop what he called “the forces of darkness” of Reform and Trump.“Imagine living in the Trump-inspired country Farage wants us to become,” he said. “Where there’s no NHS, so patients are hit with crippling insurance bills. Or denied healthcare altogether.“Where we pay Putin for expensive fossil fuels and destroy our beautiful countryside with fracking, while climate change rages on. Where gun laws are rolled back, so schools have to teach our children what to do in case of a mass shooting. Where social media barons are free to poison young minds with impunity.“Where the government tramples on our basic rights and freedoms, unconstrained by the European convention on human rights. Where Andrew Tate is held up as an example to young men. Where racism and misogyny get the tacit support of people in power. Where everything is in a constant state of chaos.”He concluded: “We are in a battle for the very future of our country. And it’s not a battle we can afford to lose.”The emotive language, particularly the imagery of schoolchildren being prepared for possible mass shootings, marks a notable ratcheting up of the party’s rhetoric against Reform. It arguably also mimics Reform’s media tactics in making an accusation that seems unlikely to be true.More widely, Davey’s speech included no new policies, but instead sought to present the Lib Dems as the party of choice for voters who want to block Reform and feel let down by the Labour and Conservatives’ response to Farage.In a particular appeal to more liberal-minded Conservative voters put off by the party’s shift towards the populist right, Davey said: “My message to you is this – come and talk to us.”Echoinga rallyat the start of the conference at which party members waved union flags in a riposte to the huge far-right rally in London a week before, Davey condemned Reform’s plans to effectively end the asylum system.“Sending men, women and children who have fled the Taliban back to Afghanistan to be murdered by them, and even paying the Taliban to do it – that isn’t patriotic. That isn’t British. That isn’t who we are,” he said.He added: “There’s a questionNigel Farageis fond of asking. He likes to ask, ‘Whose side are you on?’ Well we know the answer, don’t we? Nigel Farage is on the side of Elon Musk, Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump.“Liberal Democrats are on the side of the British people. Because unlike Farage, I actually love Britain.

She also “humbly apologised” for criticising him in public and told him she was aware “you feel hellaciously let down by me”.Spare a thought for right-royal victim Duchess Fergie – it’s been another truly hellacious week | Marina HydeRead moreDescribing the phone call that prompted the email, Henderson told the Telegraph: “People don’t understand how terrible Epstein was. I can remember everything about that call.“It was a chilling call and I’m surprised anybody was ever friends with him given the way he talked to me.“He said he would destroy the York family and he was quite clear on that. He said he would destroy me. He wasn’t shouting. He had a Hannibal Lecter-type voice. It was very cold and calm and really menacing and nasty.He added: “The pressure she was put under to protect her family must have been huge. I am sure there were legal actions.“And this was long before the duke’s life had been ruined by his association with Epstein. It was 14 years ago and everyone will do what they have to do to protect their family.

The British Heart Foundation also said Ferguson was no longer a serving ambassador for the charity.Epstein was found dead in his cell at a federal jail in Manhattan, in the US, in August 2019 while he awaited trial on sex-trafficking charges.

Officers quickly swarmed him and dragged him out of the courthouse.Jurors in Routh’s trial returned a verdict of guilty on all charges after deliberating for less than three hours.The government chargedRouth, 59, with five criminal counts, including attempted assassination of a major presidential candidate, possessing a firearm in furtherance of a crime of violence and assaulting a Secret Service agent, after an incident on 15 September last year when he was spotted with a rifle hiding in bushes as Trump’s golfing party approached.Prosecutors said Routh, 59, had purchased a military-grade weapon, researched Trump’s movements and utilized a dozen burner phones as part of a plot to kill Trump that was motivated by political grievances.“Today’s guilty verdict against would-be Trump assassin Ryan Routh illustrates the Department of Justice’s commitment to punishing those who engage in political violence,”US attorney general Pam Bondi said in a statement on X.“This attempted assassination was not only an attack on our [now] president, but an affront to our very nation itself,” Bondi added before thanking prosecutors and law enforcement for “protecting” Trump and “securing this important verdict”.In a post on Truth Social, Trump thanked the attorney general, deputy Todd Blanche, and the justice department team for Routh’s conviction, calling it “meticulously handled”. He also thanked “the Judge and Jury for their time, professionalism, and patience”, adding:“This was an evil man with an evil intention, and they caught him. I would also like to thank the Secret Service, Department ofFloridaLaw Enforcement, and the wonderful person who spotted him running from the site of the crime, and acted by following him, and getting all information on car type and license plate to the Sheriff’s Office, IMMEDIATELY, which led to his arrest and conviction.“What incredible instinct and foresight this person had – A very big moment for JUSTICE IN AMERICA!”Routh’s attempt on Trump’s life on 15 September 2024 came just nine weeks after the then presidential candidate narrowly survived a previous attempted assassination at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. In the earlier case, 20-year-old Thomas Crooks fired eight shots at Trump, with one bullet grazing his ear, before being killed by Secret Service counter-snipers, officials have said.At the trial, Routh represented himself despite having no legal expertise. In court filings, he suggested his case should be settled by a golf match.If Trump won, the president could execute Routh, the filing suggested. If Routh won, he said, he would become president.Routh also requested a putting green for match practice and asked for “female strippers” to be present.His self-representation intermittently threatened to derail proceedings. The presiding judge, Aileen Cannon – who dismissed an unrelated case against Trump involving federal classified documents – advised Routh to keep his comments relevant after he remarked that “modern trials seem to eliminate all that is human”. But Routh continued his musings on the “history” of human existence.Routh was once a North Carolina construction worker who had moved to Hawaii and styled himself as a mercenary leader. He tried to recruit soldiers from Afghanistan, Moldova and Taiwan to fight the Russians in Ukraine.Prosecutors said Routh made 17 trips to scope out Trump’s golf course. Over the course of his two-week trial, prosecutors called 38 witnesses, including two bothers who testified about receiving a box from Routh five months earlier that contained wires, pipes and bullets.After investigators arrested Routh, the brothers said they opened the box to find a 12-page letter in which he wrote: “This was an assassination attempt onDonald Trump, but I failed you. I tried my best and gave it all the gumption I could muster. It is up to you now to finish the job.”Routh ultimately was spotted by a Secret Service agent as he hid in nearby shrubbery while aiming a rifle at a member of Trump’s security detail. An agent fired on Routh, who initially fled the scene but was later captured driving north.Police later said the perimeter of the golf course was not fully secured as Trump was not an incumbent president and his visit was not scheduled. Routh was captured after a tipoff from a witness who had made a record of a license plate number of a car into which a man had jumped into after running out of the bushes.Routh chose not to testify in his own defense but instead called three witness, two of whom testified about his character. He told the court that he hoped they would show jurors he was incapable of killing Trump, who retook the Oval Office in January.“Give it your worst,” Routh told Cannon after she warned him about using character witnesses. “We can analyze every moment of my life. We are here to ascertain the truth – we are going to give the jury everything.”He called Marshall Hinshaw, a longtime friend, asking him if his “personal opinion” of Routh was that he was “peaceful and gentle, and nonviolent?”“I would say so,” Hinshaw said. “I would not expect you to harm anyone, Ryan.”Routh asked Hinshaw about his parenting style. “You are not aware of me hitting or spanking my children?” Routh asked.“No, maybe the other way around,” Hinshaw said. As the questioning continued, Cannon said: “This must cease. I am going to ask you to wrap up.” She later warned that she would bar Routh from addressing the jury if his closing argument was “disconnected”.Routh also called Michael McClay, a US Marine Corps veteran and expert in sniper tactics. McClay noted that Routh’s rifle – a Chinese-made variant of the AK-47 – would routinely misfire and that its scope appeared to be attached with putty, tape and glue.“Is there any way you could put a chance of success rate?” Routh asked McClay. McClay replied: “With the severity and seriousness of this, I am not going to guess that.”“I respect that,” Routh said.Routh’s line of questioning went further astray when he asked McClay, “If someone is not dedicated to their mission 100%, is an exit plan vital to those who are cowards?”McClay answered: “I don’t understand.”Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpFloridaGun crimeLaw (US)US crimeUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

The Tories have claimed that it used a “false excuse” of administrative errors.They have now released a leaked email from Labour lawyer Gerald Shamash, in which he advised McSweeney to drop his claim that he had been told he did not have to declare the donations, adding that he hoped to minimise publicity for the rule breach.“My advice, but it is in practice the only realistic route, we are being and have to be seen as transparent as possible,” Shamash wrote. “The amounts of the late reported donations is £739,492 and there are, in my view, no easy way to explain how Labour Together finds itself in this situation.“If Labour Together cannot deal substantively with questions I pose then perhaps simply best to base our case as to the non-reporting down as admin error.”It was only after McSweeney’s departure from the organisation that his replacement, Hannah O’Rourke, found almost three years of donations had not been declared and filed a series of late declarations to the watchdog.David Lammy, the deputy prime minister, has described the allegations over McSweeney’s handling of the donations as “muck-racking” but the emails threaten to reopen controversy surrounding Labour Together, which has supported Starmer’s leadership.McSweeney, who masterminded Labour’s 2024 election landslide, left his role with the thinktank in April 2020 to become a senior aide to Starmer in opposition and then in government.However, he has been facing growing unrest from Labour MPs in recent weeks over the party’s poor poll ratings, as well as criticism over his advice to Starmer to appoint Peter Mandelson as US ambassador despite knowing about his links to the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein after his conviction.Downing Street has refused to answer questions about McSweeney’s time at Labour Together, but Starmer’s official spokesperson said the prime minister continued to have “full confidence” in his chief of staff.Kevin Hollinrake, the Tory party chair, said: “TheConservativesare taking the unprecedented step of publishing leaked correspondence of the legal advice given to Keir Starmer’s chief of staff, Morgan McSweeney.“It shows how authorities may have been misled over hundreds of thousands of pounds of donations used to install Starmer as Labour leader. We believe there is a strong public interest in revealing the full truth to the public about possible criminal wrongdoing.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The outcome was made public and widely covered by the media at the time. Since this time, we have taken measures to ensure Labour Together is fully compliant with all Electoral Commission regulations.”An Electoral Commission spokesperson said: “The commission thoroughly investigated the late reporting of donations by Labour Together and published our findings in 2021.“We were satisfied that the evidence proved beyond reasonable doubt that failures by the association occurred without reasonable excuse.

I’ll negotiate with you.”Macron, who remains stuck behind a metal barrier, takes out his phone and appears to call Trump directly. Leaning on the barrier, he says, laughingly: “How are you? Guess what? I’m waiting in the street because everything is frozen for you.”Macron later appears to be allowed through on foot but not in his car. Still on his phone, he proceeds to stride off down the street, past shoppers and pedestrians. The reporter from Brut said Macron walked for about 30 minutes with his security detail. He stopped and posed with passersby who asked for photographs, including one encounter with a man who kissed him on the forehead.“The time has come to end the war in Gaza, the massacres and the death,” Macron had said during his opening speech to a special summit at the UN on Monday evening. “The time has come to do justice for the Palestinian people and thus to recognise the state of Palestine in Gaza, the West Bank and Jerusalem.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst ThingFree daily newsletterOur US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

There is only one pair at the Barbican’s first fashion exhibition in almost a decade. But the wayBalenciaga’s £1,400 faux-filthy high topscame to be not just widely coveted, but objects that seemed to express the disconnect between high fashion and the real world, is at the heart of this exhibition which presumes that the problem is not fashion rending and besmirching its garments. It’s you for not understanding why that’s exciting.View image in fullscreenA Paolo Carzana design.Photograph: Jon RigbyTaking 120 objects – mostly clothes, all filthy – by more than 60 designers both established (the oldest garment is Zandra Rhodes’s safety-pinned wedding dress from 1977) and new (star of London fashion week,Paolo Carzana), the idea is to look beyond simple provocation in order to explore the ways in which contemporary fashion has used dirt, sweat and stains to question western beauty ideals, while exposing the more sanitised side of fashion – mass-produced, internet-sold – as incomparably dirtier by contrast.Spread out among 12 rooms, each grimier than the last, the dirt in question has three sources: the environment around the clothes, the body within them, and the designers who choose to fake muck rather than waiting for the real stuff to sully their garments. The decay, meanwhile, comes from mice, scissors and time – though there aretrompe l’oeilrips too, deliberately placed. Sometimes, in the case ofHussein Chalayan’s folkloric graduate 1993 show The Tangent Flows, the clothes have been subjected to all of the above. The designer buried garments in a friend’s garden then dug them up, a sort of ruin in reverse. The first room is dedicated to seven of his pieces which hang in tatters, too delicate for mannequins. Never intended to be bought or worn, their survival is a stunning retort to our culture of disposable fashion.The remaining rooms take these two ideas (dirt, decay) and drag them through the mire of punk and grunge to modern fashion. Some items are cringe-inducing – including a dress from John Galliano’s 2000 collectionwhich he said was inspired by the homeless(and which may have inspired the 2001 film, Zoolander). Others, such asHelmut Lang’s 1998 paint-splattered jeans, the Mayflower of distressed denim, seem almost quaint by today’s tattered standards.Assistant curator Jon Astbury says that he was particularly interested in the “meticulous process of fakery” that goes into fashion. Because there is dirt and designer dirt. Spanish designerMiguel Adrover’s gown was hand-painted with birds and then caked in Nile mud. The besmirching techniques vary between designers, along with what the grime means – Vivienne Westwood’s mud is a trangression of bourgeois sensibilities, while Rei Kawakubo’s is more connected to the natural world and dyeing techniques. Each, however, seems to say something about the way we wear clothes today, and what they mean to us over time.View image in fullscreenDesigner dirt … Miguel Adrover wears a look from his AW12 collectionAmong the standout pieces are aVin + Omidress made from King Charles’s horse’s hair – he is named as a collaborator – and a Commes des Garçons blackened bridal gown which is preserved, Miss Havisham-like, in a glass box. In a grossout section on bodily fluids,JordanLuca’s urine-stained jeans are worth close examination, perhaps with a clothes peg to hand, whileJW Anderson’s pigeon clutch– transforming a filthy pest into luxury fashion – is a smart addition to the show. Sometimes, though, the rooms lack context.Andrew Groves’s razorblade dress, which served as a delightfully provocative riposte to Bill Clinton’s criticism of fashion’s glamourising drug in the 90s, feels slightly tangential without the pastiche cocaine-covered catwalk it first appeared on.The show takes a perverse but infectious joy in the way some ladle on sludge to garments that are already well-used, and the more decomposed an item is, the better. Take an already-dirty Madame Grès couture gown to which artistAlice Pottshas added her own sweat. “It’s about embracing the decay that it had suffered just by the nature of how it was kept and then adding this extra layer of artistic dirt”, says Astbury. There are thousands of gowns which are too stained with smoke and wine to show. Here, as alternatives to the sterilisation of modern fashion, is dirt as proof of a life well lived.Dirty Looks: Desire and Decay in Fashion is at the Barbican, London, from 25 September to 25 JanuaryExplore more on these topicsCultureArtFashion industryFashion weeksreviewsShareReuse this content"

No, not for 1977, when Star Wars was fresh and wondrous; after all, Disney didn’t even own it then. Not even for a decade ago, when the company brought the film series roaring back with 2015’s The Force Awakens, still the highest-grossing movie in US box office history. Rather, the trailer, consciously or not, hopes to transport viewers, and presumably profits, back to the halcyon days of … 2019.They would probably settle for any time before theirbrief but tumultuous suspensionof Jimmy Kimmel from ABC became national news. But 2019 would be preferable. That year, Disney’s almost unprecedented box office domination, boasting an astonishing seven of the year’s 10 biggest hits – and an eighth featuring Spider-Man, a Disney-owned character in a movie produced by Disney’s Marvel Studios (but released by Sony). Remakes of Aladdin and The Lion King, sequels to Toy Story and Frozen, two to three Marvel installments (depending on how to count Spider-Man), and a new Star Wars movie added up to around $10bn in global grosses. If the Star Wars movie The Rise of Skywalker landed a little soft compared to its better-reviewed predecessors, even that cloud had a silver lining: the late 2019 debut of The Mandalorian on the then new Disney+ streaming service was an instant sensation. Even genuinely rapacious corporate moves, such as Disney’s purchase of 20th Century Fox, were greeted in some fan corners with unthinking delight, because it meant some errant licensed Marvel characters could be in the MCU.Jimmy Kimmel is coming back. It’s proof that you still have power | Robert ReichRead moreAs the Covid-19 pandemic (as well as relatively bare franchise cupboards) made replicating those 2019 profits impossible over the next few years, the company at least attempted to burnish some goodwill from contemporary audiences in other ways. In particular, Disney’s various entertainment brands/fiefdoms – Pixar,Marvel, Lucasfilm, etc – seemed to keep the company’s most evil (or equivocating) corporate instincts at bay. In 2022, Pixar and Marvel employees helped push back against the company’s initial silence on Florida’s “don’t say gay” bill prohibiting discussion of sexual orientation or gender identity in elementary school classrooms, which the company eventually condemned. Those companies were also beginning, after a long delay, to diversify their slate of movies, shows and characters, with projects such as Black Panther, Captain Marvel, Turning Red and The Acolyte.But the mixed reception to some of these projects, as well as a general mortal terror that they couldn’t somehow make a Frozen, Toy Story, Star Wars and Avengers movie happen every year in perpetuity, seemed to spook Disney somewhere in the transition period from supposedly brilliant CEO Bob Iger to stumblebum replacement Bob Chapek back to Iger again. Despite his savior status, Iger himself exposed that fear when he spoke with corporate-coded cowardice about future projects not putting forward“any kind of agenda”, a pledge in deference to meaninglessness that made even the more craven “exclusively gay moments” or long-delayed female-led Marvel movie seem fiery by comparison. Corporate skittishness over including gay or minority characters that might offend vague “international audiences” was now policy.View image in fullscreenA still from Elio.Photograph: Universal Studios. All Rights Reserved./PAIn some ways, the company was probably just catching some blowback from the much-delayed revelation that CEOs are largely useless figureheads. Yet a series of clumsy, cowardly decisions seemed to transcend boardroom drama. Disney has been carrying out Iger’s edict in a sloppy panic. Seemingly rattled bythe ire of random YouTubers, the vagaries of a post-pandemic world and the re-ascension of Donald Trumpo, this year alone the company’sremoved all referencesto a transgender character’s identity on a Pixar streaming show; completed thebowdlerizationof the Latino-driven Pixar movie Elio, which originally featured a queer-coded character;reoriented(and renamed) their corporate DEI initiatives to emphasize the generation of that old fan favorite, profit; dumped Black-led Marvel show Ironheart out in a single binge despite using a weekly release model for its marquee shows; and yanked Jimmy Kimmeloff the airfor expressing skepticism over the Maga-world reaction to the murder of Charlie Kirk, before eventually backtracking. (ABC affiliates under Sinclair Broadcast Group and Nexstar ownership will continue to pre-empt the show until further notice.) In an elegant cherry of bad PR, Disney apparently decided the time was also right for a streaming-serviceprice increase, its third in three years.Of course, as with any massive corporation, Disney’s earlier diversity focus was probably more for the sake of public image and accompanying business interest than genuine empathy. It’s worth asking, then, whether any of these decisions did, in fact, make money for the company especially compared to the profits generated by the Black Panther movies, or a more diverseStar Warstrilogy. The revised Elio could scarcely have made much less at the box office; it’s the lowest-grossing Pixar movie other than those directly affected by the pandemic. Are any Disney+ subscriptions attributable to de-transing a supporting character on an eight-episode miniseries? On the other hand, plenty of people did seem to cancel their subscriptions over the Kimmel battle, and the company’s stock price dipped over the past week. If the idea for any of this was winning back Maga folks in the long run, well, good luck with that. They’re still fuming over the same-sex kiss in Lightyear or girls being in Star Wars or Black people being in anything. The plain truth is, there’s a certain Maga demographic that accepts nothing less than full capitulation to their preferences and values – and you can’t dabble in full capitulation.That’s why Disney’s realwishmust be for a 2019 revival. Back then, there might have been little teapot-level tempests here and there from audience segments who complain that a remake is too woke or, on the less rabid side, who regard the inclusion of, say, queer supporting characters as mild (and cynical) concessions, but $10bn buys executives a lot of confidence (even if it’s apparently not enough for actual courage). After all, that’s an environment where no one’s favorite Star Wars film can still eke out a billion dollars worldwide.Disney isn’t alone in facing a tough entertainment landscape where movies don’t gross quite as much and streaming services can easily tip into overspending. But it’s the company that now seems most terrified of this new world, maybe because its late-2010s surge somehow created the impression that endless and unbeatable growth on the backs of perma-beloved nostalgia brands would be possible. It’s not, and if there’s an upside to Disney’s morally checkered year, it’s the revelation that brands are not bulletproof spine protection. No one mad about Jimmy Kimmel’s suspension (or mad about his words to begin with) seems to be taking solace in the upcoming release of another Zootopia movie. The Mandalorian movie looks fun, fan-friendly, perfectly watchable … and that’s not enough to save anyone.Explore more on these topicsWalt Disney CompanyJimmy KimmelStar WarsPixarMarvelRobert IgerUS politicsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But will the Italian brand’s walk on the wild side be a renaissance, or a mid-life crisis?The first chapter of Demna’s Gucci, which openedMilan fashion week, appeared online a day ahead of schedule (very culturally modish, like a surprise album drop) and ditched the traditional catwalk format for a film by Spike Jonze and Babygirl’s director, Halina Reijn, about a fictional Barbara Gucci – “President of Gucci and of the State of California” – played by Demi Moore.The film, a high-fashion mashup of House of Gucci and The Substance, was “about how we are all trying to be so perfect, and how impossible it is”, said Demna at the opening. The film’s wardrobe told a story about the Gucci family – the nerd, the narcissist, the party boy, the diva – which sent up the brand while celebrating it at the same time. In other words, Demna showed that he understands right away what Sabato de Sarno, his predecessor, never seemed to grasp, which is that Gucci has to be about more than just clothes.View image in fullscreenDemi Moore arrives for the Milan fashion week premiere of Gucci’s The Tiger, directed by Spike Jonze and Halina Reijn.Photograph: Yara Nardi/ReutersDe Sarno was abruptly let go from the Gucci top job earlier this year, as his brand of understated urban chic, politely received by critics, proved too dull for restless modern attention spans. Demna was a surprise-choice replacement, a provocateur whose signatures are an almost-ugly bulky silhouette and headline-grabbing fashion week stunts including a catwalk show that turned out to be a Simpsons cartoon, and wrapping Kim Kardashian in duct tape. A bold hire for the home of glossy handbags and sensible, evergreen leather loafers.Sipping non-alcoholic champagne before the film’s premiere at a screening room installed in Milan’s stock exchange, Demna said that he wanted to define “the allure” of Gucci. “If Gucci was a person, it would have a decisive and daring character, someone fun but intelligent with a strong point of view, who wanted to enjoy themselves,” he said. His Gucci iconography drew as much from Ridley Scott’s soapy 2021 biopic of the fashion house as it did from the archives of silk scarves and handbags. “Gucci is a non-traditional story: how this dysfunctional family evolved into one of the biggest brands,” said Demna, who attended the screening with his mum as his plus one. “I come from a very dysfunctional family, and the idea of family, and how imperfect or perfect that is, is one of the aspects of Italian culture that is very compelling to me.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFashion StatementFree weekly newsletterStyle, with substance: what's really trending this week, a roundup of the best fashion journalism and your wardrobe dilemmas solvedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

No babies have been thrown out with the bathwater. Bamboo-handled bags and silk blouses still rule and the doomy, aggro energy that characterised Demna’s Balenciaga has been left behind in Paris for now. But Demna found a sideways kind of synergy with his new home. There are headscarves, which are both Gucci (where they are very Jackie Onassis on holiday) and Demna (more eastern-bloc street style). There are wallpapered-on logos, which can feel careful and bourgeois at Gucci, but looked trashy and provocative when Demna did them at Balenciaga.The Gucci paradox is that it stands for a fundamentally conservative aesthetic – loafers, after all, are about as sensible as high fashion gets – but has had its glory days when headed up by designers who enjoy ruffling feathers. Gucci led the fashion conversation whenTom Ford spiced it up with X-rated adverts, and when Alessandro Michele made it a champion ofpussy-bows-for-all gender fluidity. Demna has arrived at a company that is flatlining: sales at Gucci dropped 25% in the second quarter of the financial year, a serious problem for Kering, where it is the biggest brand in the group. Gucci needs a shake-up, and that is exactly what is on the cards.Explore more on these topicsMilan fashion weekGucciSpike JonzeDemi MooreFashion weeksnewsShareReuse this content"

No surprise, given they work for any social scenario that doesn’t call for a smart dress code. But subtle design details can take your chosen pair from good to great – you just have to know where to look and what to look out for.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.As a menswear writer and stylist, I’ve seen my fair share of denim, from high street to vintage, small menswear labels to heritage brands (I’m looking at you, Levi’s). And I’ve developed some tried and tested denim shopping principles.As with most menswear essentials, finding the best pair of jeans is more about fit and finish than trends, so your chosen pair should be well made using a good-quality fabric with a timeless cut to ensure you’ll be wearing them for years to come. This is my edit of the best jeans brands out there, and the styles to try.The best men’s jeans in 2025Best heritage denimLevi’s 555View image in fullscreenBest for:the OG pair of jeans£100 at Levi£64.40 at AmazonLike trench coats and Burberry or Harrington jackets and Baracuta, it’s impossible to talk about denim without mentioning Levi’s. The heritage label is credited with creating blue jeans as we know them today more than 150 years ago – and you can still buy thatoriginal signature silhouettein 20 different finishes.I have a few pairs of the OG in my wardrobe, some of which are thrifted, but the cut I’m wearing most right now is the 555. It’s a more relaxed alternative with a dropped seat and wider leg, so it feels on trend without looking excessively baggy. Each of the five colours available (light blue, mid blue, dark blue, indigo, black) is cut from a rigid non-stretch denim, so they’ll retain their shape no matter how long you wear them.Lee Brooklyn straightView image in fullscreenBest for:a slim classic£75 at Lee£75 at M&SLee started out making one-piece overalls for workers before entering the denim scene in the 1920s, and it remains one of the biggest players today. The website has more than 80 styles to choose from, from a baggy 90s-coded pair to a stretch skinny (although I’d recommend avoiding the latter: this look is more likely to date).My top pick? The Brooklyn. With a true straight cut and a slight high rise, this is the perfect everyday silhouette that feels relaxed yet intentional. The 13oz denim makes this style heavyweight enough for an expensive feel, while the low level of stretch makes it comfy, too. A win-win.Wrangler Texas low stretchView image in fullscreenBest for:a boot-cutFrom £75 at Wrangler£54.99 at AmazonWrangler began making jeans for cowboys back in the 1940s – the first design was the Wrangler 11MWZ, which introduced rear pockets positioned for comfort during riding, no rivets to avoid scratching the saddle, a strong crotch seam to prevent splitting and a boot-cut fit to allow for, you guessed it, boots. You can still buy the same design today; it’s been renamed the 13MWZ because it’s now made with 13oz denim.Since the boot-cut fit is a trend that comes and goes, it might be safer to go for the Texas, the brand’s regular-fit straight leg, instead. It’s a little slimmer than your average straight leg, so it’s great for guys who prefer a more streamlined finish. These jeans have 1% elastane, so they’re comfy without feeling stretchy, and the waist size runs from 24 to 50 inches, so most body shapes are catered for.Gap dark indigoloose-fitjeansView image in fullscreenBest for:an affordable heritage brand£45 at Gap£45 at NextGap might not be classed in the denim heritage label big league, but the brand’s history is firmly rooted in denim. The company actually started out as a San Francisco store selling Levi’s jeans (and records) in 1969. The label then launched its own line in 1974.Fifty years on, it’s a go-to destination for denim. After a rocky patch in 2020, it’s now led by creative director Zac Posen, and the menswear collections are becoming stronger every season. These jeans are a prime example, with an elevated dark blue wash, a baggy yet tapered fit, an authentic-feeling rigid fabric and contrast stitching. The price is comparatively good too.Best high-street denimArket Park regular straight jeansView image in fullscreenBest for:high-street denim£57.75 at Asos£75 at ArketArket is the best place to go on the high street for denim. The Scandi label uses quality fabrics and modern fits for pieces that look more expensive than they are. My pick is this pair of straight-leg jeans in non-stretch denim with a classic-mid-rise waist and legs tapered from the knee. They’re good quality too: I’ve had a pair of these in my own wardrobe for years.The best men’s waterproof jackets: get outdoors whatever the weather with our expert-tested picksRead moreMango Moby straight fit jeansView image in fullscreenBest for:value for money£49.99 at Mango£49.99 at AsosMango’s menswear is often overlooked, but every season the Barcelona-based high-street store produces strong collections full of well-crafted, wearable pieces that won’t break the bank. The denim selection is consistently strong, from the taper to the straight leg (again, I would suggest you avoid the skinny fit). My favourite is the Moby, which comes in four colours.M&S AutographJapanese selvedgejeansView image in fullscreenBest for:accessible selvedge£60 at M&SSelvedge is a premium type of denim that’s created using old-fashioned shuttle looms, creating a self-finished hem that doesn’t fray – this is known as a ‘self-edge’, hence the name. But if you find the stiffness and expense of it off-putting, Marks & Spencer has come up with a pair that’s softened with 2% elastane and retails for a reasonable price. The jeans are a slim fit – a little too tight for my preference, but they’d make the perfect transition from skinnies to a more modern fit. They come in three shades.Uniqlo wide tapered jeansView image in fullscreenBest for:well-priced Japanese-style denim£29.90 at UniqloJapan is famous for its denim, so it’s no wonder the globally renowned Japanese store Uniqlo has one of the best selections going. Right now, the retailer has jeans that come in slim or wide – since Japanese jeans are best known for their voluminous yet cropped fit, I’d recommend opting for the latter. This style has a wide barrel leg that becomes a little slimmer at the ankle for a sleeker finish. If you’re covered on the mid-blue front, there’s indigo, cream and black to choose from, too.Best mid-range and luxury denimA Day’s March Langley denim trousersView image in fullscreenBest for:timeless Scandi denim£150 at A Day’s MarchThis Stockholm-based brand’s MO is creating clothes you’ll want to wear just as much tomorrow as in 10 years’ time, focusing on timeless silhouettes that are designed to last.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe FilterFree weekly newsletterGet the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

There are just three silhouettes: the Langley, which is a true straight leg; Denim no 2, a slimmer iteration; and Denim no 3, a loose, relaxed choice. My favourite is the first, which feels like the epitome of what a straight fit should be – the quality is evident the moment you try them on.Agolde 90s FairwayjeansView image in fullscreenBest for:loose, modern fits£320 at AgoldeAgolde has become a firm fashion favourite in recent years. It was originally founded in the 90s by Adriano Goldschmied – who is known as the “Godfather of denim” thanks to his involvement in launching denim giants Diesel and Replay – then became inactive during the 00s before its relaunch in 2014. In the decade since, it’s become catnip for the fashion crowd thanks to the premium quality, cool silhouettes and strong collaborations with brands such as RSVP Gallery.The brand’s strengths lie in its loose, 90s-inspired shapes. My favourite is the 90s jean, which comes in 16 different washes, including some with distressed details and cut-off hems. Whichever colour you prefer, you’ll get a well-made pair of jeans in a first-rate denim.Gant straight fit jeansView image in fullscreenBest for:preppy designs£135 at GantAmerican prep is a popular trend right now – and no brand does it better than Gant. You can find everything from v-neck knits to Oxford shirts, slacks, baseball caps and rugby tops – all pieces crafted with longevity and quality in mind. Straight-leg jeans always have a collegiate quality, and the archive-inspired vintage wash doubles down on the look. Made using a cotton-viscose denim, these take the #1 spot for softness.Sandro Waterless narrow cut jeansView image in fullscreenBest for:Parisian-coded jeans£219 at SandroIf you like an effortlessly chic Parisian look (who doesn’t?), jeans are a key component of the uniform. You’ll undoubtedly see denim in all shapes and sizes around the capital city, but the quintessentially French shape is slim yet relaxed – something that wouldn’t look out of place walking down a Celine runway. But there’s one snag – jeans by luxury French houses such as Celine will set you back roughly £800. The good news? You can get a similar look for less (albeit still a high price tag) at Parisian label Sandro – and this style is a case in point. They’re made using a raw indigo denim, but are also available in stiff black – and they’re cut to relaxed-slim perfection.View image in fullscreenBest for:a fashion-forward silhouette£245 at Studio NicholsonIf I could choose one label to wear from top to bottom every day, it would be cult favourite Studio Nicholson. The brand puts emphasis on cut and quality rather than showy statement pieces, so it makes sense that the selection of denim is among the best.The London-based designer’s signature fit is sleek yet boxy, inspired by the traditional Japanese cut, and the jeans follow suit. Expect structured wide legs, heavyweight fabrics, slightly cropped lengths and pleats in all the right places. My favourite is the Puch, which is elevated with a wide cuff and sharp single pleats on each leg.Best responsible denimAsketthe Regular jeansView image in fullscreenBest for:responsibly made denim£150 at AsketIt’s often hard to make jeans sustainably, but these by responsible label Asket are made using organic cotton and recycled metal buttons. They’re almost entirely manufactured in Italy, too, keeping the carbon footprint as low as possible for each pair. The website even details each garment’s environmental impact with a transparent CO2emissions and water and energy usage breakdown.Beyond manufacturing, these jeans are designed to transcend the trend cycle and live in your wardrobe for years to come. If this fit looks too relaxed for you, the label also offers aslim alternative.NudieJeansDeadstockView image in fullscreenBest for:deadstock optionsFrom £145 at NudieThis Swedish denim expert uses only organic cotton sourced from Turkey and India, and the brand’s mission is to make jeans that last for decades – if you have a pair that’s beyond repair, you canreturn it for recycling.You can also choose to buy from the deadstock collection, which has been crafted using denim left over from previous designs – and each design details the year the deadstock fabric is sourced from. They’re always limited edition, so they often sell out.Subscribe to the mailing listto become a member and you’ll be notified when a new pair goes live.Vintage denimView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Ognyan Yosifov/AlamyBest for:sustainable denim at a great priceSince denim is built to last, it’s always worth looking at the preloved market – I found my favourite pair of Levi’s 501s in Goodwill for just $12. Fit is obviously crucial, so I’d recommend finding a silhouette you like before searching for that specific style at online retailers such as Vinted and eBay, vintage stores and even charity shops – the latter is usually best for a bargain. Take a look at myguide to secondhand clothesfor more tips and tricks on navigating the preloved market.Shop atVinted,eBay,Depop,Rokit,Beyond RetroorOxfam.What you need to knowHow should my jeans fit?Let’s talk about silhouette. There will always be a shape that’s in vogue – one minute it’s all about skinny jeans, the next a 90s-coded baggy fit stomps down the runway and all over your TikTok – but some cuts seem to outlive the trend cycle. If you want your jeans to last beyond the next season, a classic straight or slim cut is best.What type of denim is best?Heavyweight denim generally looks and feels more expensive. In my experience, stretch jeans lose their shape quickly compared with a more rigid textile, but some men prefer the softness and comfort that comes with a touch of elastane. Denim devotees will tell you selvedge is the best choice. Not only is it more durable thanks to its untreated finish, but it’s also known for developing a rich natural fade over time that you don’t get with other denim.What colour of jeans should I get?Each colour and wash ticks a different box. Generally, it’s best to stick with blue, black or neutrals and avoid anything too distressed. Every man should have a trusty mid-blue in their collection, while indigo is great for a smart-casual dress code. True black is the most versatile and cream is stylish for summer, while light blue is the most casual. Once you’ve found the fit you like, I’d recommend buying it in a few colours.What are the best denim brands?There are good high-street options – just make sure you choose a pair by a brand whose quality you trust. Dedicated heritage denim brands are generally the safest bet, while luxury labels will guarantee quality but come with a hefty price to match.If sustainability is a priority for you, it’s worth bearing in mind that denim isn’t a particularly environmentally friendly fabric. The average pair of jeans takes 3,781 litres of water to make,according to the UN Environment Programme. But some labels are making an effort to produce their denim as ethically as possible. Among them is Asket, which uses organic cotton, recycled materials and provides an environmental “impact receipt” with every order.But perhaps the most responsible way to shop denim is to buy secondhand at thrift stores, charity shops and online marketplaces such as eBay and Vinted. Either way, shop wisely, stick to classic shapes, and you’ll be wearing your jeans for years.For more men’s fashion from the Filter, read Peter Bevan’sguide to transitional dressingandthe best suits under £400Peter Bevan is a stylist and fashion journalist covering menswear, womenswear and beautyExplore more on these topicsJeansThe FilterMen's fashionMen's trousersfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Maybe you should tuck your shirt in?I literally can’t. I’m wearing one of the new waist-skimming shirts that are all the rage for men right now.Brrr, chilly.Well, it’s hot news, actually. TheNew York Timesreported on the shrinkage of men’s tops, with New York fashion week featuring “models in tees and sweaters shrunken nearly to the navel” and “a button-up shirt that stopped well above the waistline”. Meanwhile, in the real world, retailers are selling loads of shorter men’s shirts.So is this shrinkflation, but for menswear? With cynical fashion companies cutting costs and calling it a trend?Well, people are also doing DIY versions, cutting the tails off their shirts using TikTok tutorials, so it does seem genuinely popular. Fashion-forward chaps are wearing skimpier tops to balance out their baggy trousers. “Jelly to the big pants peanut butter,” the New York Times called it.Thatmightbe the most American sentence ever written.Would you prefer “Marmite to the large trousers cheddar”?No, the ratio is off– you need a 50/50 sandwich. Maybe prawn to mayo?We’re getting off track. The point is, there’s a new silhouette in men’s fashion, and people are wondering what it means.Well, that’s easy: nothing.But it’s not the first instance of men’s clothes getting skimpier. Crop tops for men werebig fashion news in 2023and stuck around, and we’ve just lived through a “thigh guy summer”, with lots of male leg on display. Google searches for Speedos have increased 41% year on year in the UK; and some high street shorts boasted 5in, and even 3in inseams.Soundseye-watering. That’s not a look anyone butPaul Mescalshould attempt, surely?Mescal helpedpopularise short shortsbut loads of men have started flaunting their thighs – and now they’re adopting short shirts, too.OK, I’m intrigued.What’syour theory?Well, it’s partly about bigging up your body in a gym-obsessed age. “The biggest flex at the moment isn’t a designer item. It is your body. People want to show how hard they have been working out,” stylist Luke Day explained back in May. Skimpy shirts and crop tops highlight toned stomachs (reborn as a “male erogenous zone”, according to the NYT), and short shorts show you never skip leg day.What else might be happening?We’re arguably seeing a “queering of men’s fashion”, as aFinancial Times podcastlast year described it, with men of all orientations enjoying being more playful and generally fabulous in how they dress.Nice! Plus skimpy fashions use less fabric, which is good for the planet.Not buying new clothes at all would be way better but shh … the fashion police will hear us.Do say:“Who wears short shirts?” “We wear short shirts!”Don’t say:“Hypothermia’s so hot right now.”Explore more on these topicsLife and stylePass notesMenfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The young star talks nepo babies – and playing posh whiteTue 23 Sep 2025 11.37 EDTLast modified on Tue 23 Sep 2025 14.29 EDTShareWhen some enterprising director gets around to making Pete Doherty: The Movie, Frank Dillane won’t need to audition. With his black leather jacket, bed-head and baby face, this could be the youthful Libertines frontman seated before me next to a potted plant in an east London cafe. Unlike the young Doherty, however, the actor’s drug of choice is a flat white. And he isn’t hell-bent on sabotaging his career. Not any more.After playing the haunted, drug-addicted Nick Clark in four seasons of the zombie TV spin-offFear the Walking Dead, Dillane, now 34, fled to Berlin for two years and turned his back on fame. A glance at some of the video interviews he did to promote the show is enough to explain why: he looks at best fidgety, at worst bored and resentful.I grew facial hair for the film but I shaved it all off. It spoilt the innocent effect – I looked like a cartel boss“Nick was a junkie, and my work on the show was all about understanding him,” he says, toying with the three gold rings on his right hand. “Then I’d be asked all these questions that trivialised what I’d done.” Behind the scenes, there were stern words about his behaviour. “I was told to talk differently, dress differently, attend media training.” Did he? “No. I was a young, bloody-minded artist!” Eyes crinkling, he gives a wheezy laugh. His Artful Dodger charm could disarm a warmonger.View image in fullscreenBad fit … Dillane as Nick in Fear the Walking Dead.Photograph: Justin Lubin/AMCThat hiatus in Berlin temporarily arrested his ascent. “Straight after Fear the Walking Dead was the moment to capitalise on everything and dothisfilm orthatfilm,” he reflects. “But I didn’t want it.”He does now. Fortunately, the perfect vehicle to relaunch himself, and to show off his range and sensitivity, has arrived in the shape of Urchin, the directorial debut of Harris Dickinson, star ofBabygirl. Dillane plays Mike, an unhoused Londoner ricocheting from pavement to prison to hostel. An odyssey that could have been punishingly bleak is redeemed partly by the actor’s sheer ebullience. Whether chancing upon a pair of snakeskin loafers in a charity shop, presenting his probation officer with a miniature cactus or belting out a karaoke rendition of Atomic Kitten’s Whole Again, Mike stays upbeat when the chips are down, which is most of the time.Even when he is bad, the good still peeks through: knocking a stranger to the ground, he mutters his apologies as he raids his victim’s pockets. “There’s a childishness that I wanted to achieve with him,” says Dillane, crossing one leg over the other and exposing pale pink socks worn with battered penny loafers. “Early on, I grew facial hair for the film, but then I shaved it all off. It spoilt the innocent effect when I looked like a cartel boss.”Genial he may be but Dillane is in no hurry to discuss his preparation for Urchin. He confirms that the begging scenes are authentic, shot on busy streets using a long lens: “People ignore you when you approach them. It makes you feel like you’re not human.” What he won’t reveal is whether he slept rough, as has previously been reported, or what sort of history he mapped out for Mike. “I want to keep that stuff to myself. You guys have the film.”When I inquire after the character’s body language, he lets out a mock-huff – “Fine!” – and admits that he did a drawing of Mike before shooting began. “I wrote a trauma in each joint. His right foot is held like that because of an injury. His leg is like that because of the time some girl rejected him. He holds his back that way from the stress of when he got shouted at. He’s carrying everything around with him.”At first, Dillane wondered if race might be an impediment to playing Mike. “I saw him as a white kid from an estate in England,” he says. “But my mum’s Jamaican so I don’t classify myself as white. I’ll often get cast as posh white people. The posh thing I’ll take. I’m not going to pretend I’ve had an upbringing like Mike.”View image in fullscreenOut for fun …… from left, Karyna Khymchuk, Dillane and Shonagh Marie in Urchin.Photograph: Everett/ShutterstockFar from it. After spending his early years in south London, he moved with his parents – actors Naomi Wirthner (Slow Horses) and Stephen Dillane (Sherwood, Game of Thrones) – to Forest Row, East Sussex, which was named Britain’s third poshest village in a 2023 Times poll. “Third poshest?” he gasps. “Third weirdest, maybe. There’s a lot of Scientology there.”Back to race. “I was the darkest person in the school when I got to Sussex. And I’ve had the experience of being paled up for roles, blue contact lenses, that kind of stuff. Like when I played Voldemort.”At 18, Dillane starred as the villain’s younger incarnation, Tom Riddle, the Teen Who Must Not Be Named, inHarry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince. He has since notched up numerous period roles, from a highwayman in Sally Wainwright’sRenegade Nellto a doctor inThe Essex Serpent. He will next be seen alongside Daisy Edgar-Jones in a new film of Sense and Sensibility, in which he plays Mr Willoughby. “He’s a car crash,” he says fondly. In an age before cars? “Yeah. A carriage crash!”It seems to have only just dawned on Dillane that he has spent much of his career in period dress. “I’ve done a lot of that stuff, haven’t I? Maybe I’m being shortsighted thinking that mixed-race people can’t do posh period roles.” He drums his hands on the table. “I feel like I’m unravelling as I’m getting into this with you. I should be talking to my therapist about it.”View image in fullscreenPeriod piece … Dillane as Charles Devereux in Renegade Nell.Photograph: Disney +The trick with capturing Mike, he discovered, was to see beyond race. “I had this idea of the human animal. Like, if you take a human being and remove their security, family, friends, home, then what are you left with? It’s all about humanity.” That shines through. No wonder he took home a best actor prize from the Un Certain Regard sidebar at Cannes this year.Any tension between the dire circumstances in which Mike finds himself, and his determination, verging on zeal, to make the best of things, is vital to the movie. It almost broke Dillane’s heart. “Mike’s thinking, ‘Everything’s going to be fine’. And then it isn’t. That was difficult to achieve. Harris had to keep reminding me: ‘This is an optimistic moment.’ For me, it’s all so sad, you know?” He gets a faraway look, his eyes gleaming with tears. “My experience of researching and working on the film was one of intense suffering. Not just personal suffering but the impotence of not being able to help people: their fragility, their addiction.”He talks passionately about inequality and the consolidation of wealth, and his time spent working for a homelessness charity long before he was cast in Urchin. I wonder how that sits with his education at the fee-paying Michael Hall school, which proudly posted about his Cannes win on its Facebook page. (The post earned 42 likes.)“Yeah, but I went to a Steiner school before that,” he says. “It was three caravans in a field. Also, when I went to Rada, the fee wasn’t what it is today. It’s really expensive now.” He mulls this over. “I guess it is kind of embarrassing. We all have our privilege. I do hold guilt for it, I suppose.” Then there is his status as a nepo baby. “Nep-oh-tism. It’s quite a nice word, isn’t it? Look, I dunno. Acting is just what my family always did. What doesyourdad do?” Finding that the answer isn’t journalism, he relents. “Maybe it’s different for writers.”Still, no one who sees Urchin could accuse Dillane of coasting on the family name. Playing Mike has fundamentally changed him, he insists. “My humanity is broader. I’m sorry to bring Jesus into this, but Jesus went among the lepers. He gave time, energy and love. Giving yourself to a situation, to a person, without the endgame of fixing them can be helpful. People want quick, simple solutions to complex problems like homelessness. But there aren’t any. Your willpower alone will not fix the world.”Urchin review – Harris Dickinson’s homelessness drama is a terrific directorial debutRead moreUrchin has also rejuvenated his career prospects. “I wasn’t engaging with any of it before in the way that, say, Timothée Chalamet does. He’s fucking on it, right? And he loves it. I see myself now as more like that. Talking to my agents, turning up looking neat, trying this and chasing that and la-la-la-la-la.”As we head off together into the drizzly afternoon, Dillane clutching a black satchel, he admits to being nervous when he strolled into the cafe an hour earlier. “I wanted to paint a good picture of myself and not dwell too much on my mistakes,” he says. “A lot of my existence now involves the older me coming to terms with choices that the younger me made: ‘You turned downwhat?’And: ‘I can’t go back and change that’ It’s like: ‘No. So now what do you do?’” The answer seems obvious. You do more good films. More films like Urchin.Urchin released on 3 OctoberExplore more on these topicsFilmTelevisioninterviewsShareReuse this content"

In their stickiest hours, people rely on him to restore orderByTom LamontTue 23 Sep 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 23 Sep 2025 10.21 EDTShareWhen the entrance to a theatre in London’s West End was discovered to be smeared with blood and faeces one day in March, a distress call went out to the headquarters of Ben Giles, a 49-year-old veteran of the extreme clean, who is based in Cardigan inWales. Decades earlier, as a young know-nothing, hired by police to clean vehicles, Giles laboured for hours to remove fingerprint dust from the interior of a stolen car – work that now, with the experience of innumerable litter-dashed, liquid-sodden, gunge-roped scenes, would take him about 30 minutes. Job by job, he figured out when to scrape or sand, soak or fog, preserve or dispose. Boilersuited and plastic booted, Giles learned how to eliminate most evidence of spillages, collisions, protests, haemorrhages, severings, explosions, fires and floods, becoming a self-taught stain savant, a walking database of remedies. When you have lifted a layered lasagne of toilet paper and semen from the floor of a submarine yard in Barrow-in-Furness, there’s not much left in the world that can scare you.What exactly was the problem in the West End? Details were explained to one of Giles’s operators at the Cardigan HQ. About 4 o’clock that afternoon in March, a person had defecated in front of the Dominion theatre. Ticket-holders were due to arrive, very soon, for an evening performance of The Devil Wears Prada. When emergencies like this come in, Giles’s staff are meant to log whatever information is available on the office network. “Human waste at the front of the Dominion,” an operator wrote at 4.32pm, then, at 4.53pm: “Someone has splattered it on doors now.” A queue was expected to form any time after 6pm.Giles, a handsome, weather-beaten, wedge-haired man, built up his empire from small beginnings. In his 20s he was a freelance window cleaner, 50p a pane, when one of his clients – a lady in Aberystwyth – asked if he would clear out a vacated property she managed. When Giles got inside he found a bathtub full to the brim with piss and turds. Asked how much he expected to be paid to empty all this, trowel by trowel, Giles quoted a random sum: £2,000. Later he realised he could have asked for much more. If a stain or a mess is repulsive enough, stubborn enough, enough of an obstacle to the sterilised good order of things, its removal is seen as a delivery of near-religious proportions.He started Ben Giles Cleaning with a few mates in the late 1990s. As the company grew he changed its name to Ultima because – ultimately – his lot would try their hand at anything: roadkill, toppled bin lorries, smeared theatre doors, sure. With his trusted deputy, Mark Baxter, a suited, Croc-wearing Englishman, Giles started a training academy in the 2010s from which has emerged a vast corps of about 600 freelance cleaners he can call on for rapid deployment. A couple of these were sent to the Dominion with mops and buckets, arriving on the scene just after 5pm that March afternoon.“And within an hour of the call it was done,” said Baxter, as he sat with Giles outside a bar in Paddington station. It was the week after the Dominion crisis. Giles and Baxter were fresh off the Carmarthen train, in London to meet executives at a conglomerate called Atlas, which absorbed Ultima a few years ago. That deal made Giles rich. He bought an Italian restaurant in Cardigan and a herd of shaggy Highland cows, entering a kind of partial retirement, kept on by Atlas as Ultima’s chief consultant, a professor emeritus of mess. By the spring of 2025 he had reached a reflective phase of life, with a self-published autobiography to his name and a new side hustle as a consultant on a TV show. Every day he was called on for tips, fixes, magic bullets.At the same time as the Dominion crisis was unfolding, for instance, Giles was in his cow field at home, receiving texts from a graduate of his training academy. The ex-student was somewhere in the north-east of England, working on an entirely different job. “Can you help?” she wrote to Giles. “It’s solidified phlegm. Won’t wipe off.” Pictures, included in the message, showed a residential property where buds of tobacco-coloured spit were spread in appalling Vs over most of the walls, doors and ceilings. It looked as though a flock of starlings had settled in for a month. “Thinking of scraping or even sanding it,” the ex-student wrote, asking Giles: “What are your thoughts?”View image in fullscreenBen Giles with his deputy, Mark Baxter, Cardigan, Wales, July 2025.Photograph: Dimitris Legakis/Athena PicturesHis thoughts? Mixed, mixed. Giles has cleaned in rooms containing skeletons in beds and armchairs, skeletons wearing leather belts, leather shoes, all that remains of someone’s clothing after a decade or more of undisturbed decay. He has dug out hoarders who’ve accidentally interred themselves, dying like pharaohs inside mausoleums of boxes, videotapes, magazines. He once collected hundreds of used needles from an abandoned train depot in Bath. Towards the end of that job, working in the dark, one of his colleagues disturbed an addict, who promptly added another needle to the total before wandering off. When a truck driver misjudged a hill in Devon, Giles’s office got the call to pick up hundreds of oily, slippery pig skins from the road.He wrote back to the ex-student, for heaven’s sake, don’t sand off dried phlegm, you don’t want all that airborne. Instead, he suggested filling a mechanical fogger with a cleaning chemical called Byotrol 4-in-1 (a product that Giles holds in high regard), then setting the machine to output a fine mist. Let the phlegm soften, he advised, then wipe it away gently with a scourer or scraper. Another predicament sorted. Sitting outside the bar in Paddington station, Giles and Baxter recalled other closed cases: the burst vein on Christmas Day, the horse’s head dragged through a supermarket by a disgruntled employee.Some jobs are logged as finished on the office network then forgotten about. Others are wild enough to earn a nickname as well as a place in the pantheon of tales that Giles likes to swap with Baxter to pass the time. “Do you remember Ratty Rolex?” he said. Oh, Baxter remembered. Ratty Rolex was a case that involved an imitation timepiece, a rodent-infested pit at the bottom of a lift shaft, and a security guard’s severed arm. I suggested that one day they might look back on the Dominion theatre job as Shit Play, but Giles and Baxter weren’t listening. They were discussing the time they arranged toclear a 20-tonne whalefrom Portsmouth harbour. That was on New Year’s Eve, 2019. When Giles saw the photos, he told Baxter, “Well, don’t say no.”Friends telephone Giles all the time. They tag him on Facebook or they try to reach him through his grownup kids, wondering how to get rid of red wine spills, iron burns, spots of wee. Stains are stubborn truth-tellers. They remind us that we are animals, beholden to life’s disorderly processes. We come into this world streaked and matted. We puke, piss, shit and bleed for as long as we’re here. Odds are we depart with some ghastly final eruptions, too. It isn’t always nice to think about. One of the reasons Giles gets paid is so that not everybody has to.What registers as mere dirt or damage to most of us – a blot on the ideal of a wipe-clean world – might be inspiring, life-changing, fortune-making to others. The poet Elizabeth Bishop was moved to compose one of her loveliest phrases by a patch of rot. She observed the way a damp wall seemed to be marred by “mildew’s ignorant map”. Connie Francis went top five in the charts with a 1959 breakup song about a lipstick smudge. “You said it belonged to me … then I noticed yours was red, mine was baby pink.” In 1994’s Pulp Fiction, Quentin Tarantino gave his gore-sodden killers, Jules and Vincent, some immortal dialogue about cleanliness. Vincent: “Blood’s real hard to get off.” Jules: “I used the same fuckin’ soap you did, and when I got finished, the towel didn’t look like no goddamn maxi-pad.” A few years after Pulp Fiction’s release, Monica Lewinsky left a function at Bill Clinton’s White House withmarks on her dressthat she dismissed, at first, as spinach dip.If you see the world through stains, you see questions to be matched with answers. “Mildew’s ignorant map” can be treated with a bleaching agent, sodium perborate. For lipstick on your collar, work in Vaseline, then sponge the stain with a grease solvent, carbon tetrachloride. Never apply hot water to blood because that will set the stain, Lady Macbeth-ing it. I learned some of these methods from Giles, and others from a wartime pamphlet, Stain Removal from Fabrics, written by Margaret Smith Furry, an American textile chemist and a foundational figure in the cleaning industry. Furry did not have anything to say about semen in the 1940s, but by the 21st century the Good Housekeeping Institute was ready to offer a joke about Clinton, then a page on the subject in its handbook Spills, Spots and Stains.It was Giles’s luck, as a child, never to pick up any squeamishness towards spills, spots or stains. If anything, he was affirmed in opposite habits. His parents were self-sufficient farmers. Giles, the middle of three children, grew up “smelling like a used wheelie bin”. He was a kid who once dragged animal droppings across the family carpet, grinding in the pieces as he pretended to be a farmer fertilising a field. Shortly before one of his grandmothers died, she surprised him by recalling she’d cleaned up after dead people. “I used to get first pick of the antiques,” she told Giles, who marvelled at the coincidence. “Subconsciously, was this the reason I went into this line of work?” he wrote in his memoir, The Life of aCrimeScene Cleaner. “Or the reason I could do it with ease?”Giles has plucked translucent body lice off the upholstery of cars. He knows, from intimate exposure, the difference between picked, dried snot and that looser liquid gush brought about by the deployment of pepper spray. He has dealt with the flakes from impetigo sores. “And if someone has defecated themselves …” He paused. “Are you alright to talk about this while you’re eating?”It was breakfast time in Cardigan, a fine morning in May. We were enjoying a breakfast of bacon sandwiches. I nodded for Giles to continue.He said, “The fine line is where a stain’s worth removing. A pillow covered in blood I won’t even attempt, that’s straight in the bag for disposal. In vehicles, everything’s more expensive to replace. When your driver has vomited over the air vents, it’s a massive task.”Furry’s fundamental rule, endorsed by Giles, is that a stain or a mess must be tackled from the outside in, to avoid spread. He learned this for himself while contesting a mop-off in a Welsh police station. Early in his career, Giles was trying to win a valuable tender from the local police force. He noticed that every time his rival for the job went in and out of a urine-splashed cell, he trod around pissy footprints, enlarging the task at hand. Giles went down on all fours, inching forwards from the corridor.For the rookie cleaner, Giles told me, there is no better place to be than a soiled prison cell. Cells are where he now sends trainees, rather as you might post a young diplomat to Geneva, there to learn a bit of everything. From this experience emerged what he calls, partly in jest, the Giles Method. He tells his students to refer back to the method’s first principle: “Everything in front of you is dirty. Everything behind you is clean.”After breakfast we walked through Cardigan, on our way to visit company headquarters. I have always been an unusually attractive landing place for stains – candle wax, tea, toothpaste, chicken fat – but by some miracle I ate that bacon sandwich without spilling any ketchup or grease down my front. Now, as Giles swept aside a large flowering weed that had grown across a path, it brushed across my sweatshirt, leaving a streak of yellow pollen.Giles didn’t notice. He was talking about that whale, back in 2019, struck and killed by a cargo ship, then carried into Portsmouth harbour folded over the bow. In photographs the carcass resembles a vast, grey rubber glove, 22 metres in length. Giles and Baxter formed a plan to heave it off the harbour tiles intact, until someone sent them a YouTube video in which a whale in a similar state of gassy decomposition exploded.Without the relevant experience to call on, Giles said, “You’ve got to create a method.” In the case of the whale they decided on dismemberment in place, dispatching a small team with knives and later endorsing their purchase of a motorised saw to cut through the awesome jaw bone. The pieces were eventually taken to a rendering plant, leaving great lakes of blubber on the quay to be mopped with absorbent medical pads. Throughout this, Giles never left Wales, tempted though he was to drive to Portsmouth with a fishing rod. “For the photo,” he explained.View image in fullscreenA dead whale over the bow of the Cote d’Ivoirian Star, Portsmouth harbour, December 2019.Photograph: ORCAWhen he does go out on a job he wears the uniform of his crew, the white or pale-blue suits made of waxed paper, the top half of their faces covered by visors or goggles, the bottom half, special masks that filter out odours and particulates. The idea is to dull the senses: no smells, no tastes, a calming wall of clear plastic put between the eyes and some puddle or splatter or pile. Giles likes his gloves on the thin side, wearing two on each hand, for a balance between dexterity and safety. He and his cleaners go out like Batmen, Bonds, tooled up with specific equipment – skill saws, spades – just in case. Tweezer-like pickers are used to collect hypodermics. He always advises students to keep one arm behind their back. “Because I’ve seen it happen. People pick up a needle, they go to put it in a bag, they stab themselves.”In the years since Giles started his company, a culture of corporate-style procurement has taken root across the cleaning sector. “Now we’re dealing with ‘facilities management teams’. It used to be Brian-in-a-boilersuit.” As recently as the 2000s, it was common practice for British fire brigades to finish up at road accidents by hosing human blood down the drain. Viruses can go on living outside the body for days, however, and as this became more commonly understood, expectations changed. So did Giles’s equipment.He used to show up at crime scenes and other disasters with terry towels and a bottle of Dettol. Then biohazard andtrauma-scene cleaningbecame a growth industry in the US and products improved, becoming more specialised, one liquid to deal with soot, another for smoke, another for grease, and so on. Cocktails of cleaners and sanitisers were brewed and given names like government reports or gentlemen’s hair dyes. For a while, Giles favoured Formula 429, giving this up for something called 49-Plus, then Byotrol 4-in-1. He and Baxter have collaborated with chemists on bespoke liquids, their favourite an acidic, practically volcanic cleanser that helps burn human waste out of bathtub enamel. They called it Scum Off, a private joke – a reference to a Dutch urine remover that was once brought to market with a similar name.We arrived at headquarters, hidden on a leafy industrial estate outside the town centre. In an office area there is a cartoon portrait of Giles, drawn by one of his academy graduates. In the portrait, he clutches a fogger in both hands, pointing it as if it were a flame-thrower or a proton-blaster from Ghostbusters. Foggers are a must because sanitisers, deodorisers and pesticides are more effective on certain stains when applied in misty gaseous form, either hot or cold. Giles preaches “the five-minute dwell”, that is, giving a chemical time to settle and take effect. In a large storage room there were foggers, vacuum cleaners, handleless mop heads laid out on a rack like cabbages. Washing machines droned beneath a window with a view of the outside wheelie bins.We paused in front of shelves crammed with 4-in-1. “Eatsblood,” said Baxter, approvingly. Giles nodded.Blood is his most commonly faced stain, every pool, every print, every rivulet seeming to tell a uniquely troubling story. Specialist cleaners don’t want to be called back to the same blood twice, because these stains can be the hardest on the nerves. Blood day on Ultima’s training course tends to winnow out a few from each group. “That’s me done,” someone will say, as a bucket is fetched in. Giles tells them, if blood has pooled on a carpet, cleaning is hopeless, cut it out. In 2018, he went to war with the National Carpet Cleaners Association (NCCA) over the matter. The NCCA argued that, in fact, carpet stains could always be cleaned. The stalemate was resolved when Giles and Baxter hired a conference room in Bristol, made some chipboard floors, covered them in underlay and carpet, then poured on pig’s blood. Photographs from the day show frowning association men, writing in their notebooks, being taught a thing or two.We drove along green, blooming roads to visit Giles’s parents, Anne and Gray, at their farm. Ordinary English urbanites, they moved to rural Wales in the 1970s to try their hand at farming. They were poor – as Anne put it, life on the farm was “all hands on deck”. Chickens had to be plucked and rabbits skinned. Butchered animals usually filled the family freezer. From an early age, Giles knew what it was like when a lamb died inside its mother’s womb. He knew the tendons to pull when playing around with the foot of a chicken, trying to make the claws open and close. When we met Gray on the drive outside the family farmhouse, father and son embraced. Soon, they were reminiscing in familiar terms. “Remember that guy up in the field?” said Giles. “Three of his fingers came off in the silage machine. We found two of them, didn’t we? And you sent me to the shop to get ice pops to keep the fingers cold.”Gray wanted his son to have a quick look at the family JCB. Giles was dressed in smart leather shoes, pressed jeans, a woollen jumper dyed a delicate sky blue. After only the slightest hesitation he climbed on to the tractor’s front bucket, pulling away a rusted, filthy grill plate.There are stains we cannot avoid, because of obligation, because of love. There are stains we choose not to mind, like the coffee rings on books. Some people preserve stains as warnings. A US talkshow host, Seth Meyers, keeps the inky black spider of an exploded ballpoint pen on his office wall, a reminder to try not to lose his temper again. The stain is a potent metaphor in our language, because it is a visible reminder of a past misfortune or mistake that is hard to erase. A person’s character is said to be “stained” when they’ve put at serious risk the possibility of redemption or forgiveness, “indelibly stained” if these forms of expungement are beyond them.View image in fullscreenPolice tape marks the boundary of a crime scene.Photograph: Mr Doomits/AlamyWhen Giles’s Cardigan restaurant was robbed last year, police gathered evidence by covering the place in a powdered black substance called amido that stops liquid moving. On that occasion, the gods of mucky floors colluded to reward Giles for a career of loyal service. Coming in and out, the burglars must have spilled some beer and police identified the beery footprints using their powder, later making arrests. Amido can be hard to get rid of. Giles told the visiting officers not to worry, he’d seen worse, way worse.It is often the case that a person’s bowels will open at the point of death. Bladders too. Fatal haemorrhages can mean seven or eight pints. The bodies of big, heavy people tend to inflate. If they burst they’ll soak whatever’s around in liquified body fat. Once, a man died in a plastic paddling pool – that was helpful. On another occasion Giles attended the death of a worker in a timber plant. On the threshold, a forensics officer said, “This is an interesting one, there’s a big bit of him up there, some of him over there, some over there …” But Giles was more interested in the fact that the floor of the plant was covered in sawdust, an absorbent, which would make the clean-up about 50% faster.“Ben’s never shied off,” said Gray, as we stood outside the family farmhouse. “You’ve got to be a certain personality to do what he does.” Gray added that he didn’t think he could cope in a similar line of work, mentioning, by way of example, the day his own mother died. It happened a few years earlier in the building behind us, an upstairs room. “I couldn’t deal with that,” Gray said. Giles dealt with it. “I helped the undertaker put her in a bag,” he explained.Because there is no such thing as half clean – half clean is dirty – to see the world through its stains and messes is an all-or-nothing proposition. Giles has the fizzy, compulsive restlessness of a room-neatener, the urgency of someone in a rush. He has been a Jehovah’s Witness for most of his life and, as we spent more time together, I sometimes thought I saw glimpses of his worrying eye, the world being contingent, bound to end in ruin and wreckage before long. “I hate procrastinating,” he said. “I just think, get it done, get it done, get it finished.”Trying to right disorder, right away, allowed him to defer any reckoning with meaning. Giles experienced this vividly, he said, when one of his children was diagnosed with cancer. His mind went to hospitals, accommodation, transport. And only when these logistics were fixed in place, that avenue of distraction exhausted, did he implode and start weeping. (His child made a full recovery.) Gray said, “You seem to be able to tell yourself, ‘There’s a job here. Sort it out.ThenI’ll get emotional.’”“Maybe,” Giles answered.From the farm we drove to Mwnt, a beach about two miles away. Giles spent a lot of time on this beach, growing up. It was while watching dolphins swim off the shore that he felt the earliest stirrings of religious belief. “I really think that my faith, and my amazing wife and kids, have been the stabilising foundation that’s got me through lots of what I have seen and experienced,” he wrote in his book. As we sat in the car, Giles said that quite a few Jehovah’s Witnesses in his community worked as cleaners of some stripe. He met Baxter, his trusted deputy, at church. The flexible hours of cleaning suited the volunteering that is an insistent part of the religion.He told me he has been tempted, when faced with grieving families, to direct them towards scripture. He resisted: “I would hate for anyone to feel that I was using that opportunity to take advantage of them.” Instead, he depends on other releases, methods of self-preservation that go beyond the paper suit and gloves and the one-armed needle pick. After Giles attended a forklift accident in a carpet factory, he had to drive home blasting Def Leppard, trying to expel what he’d witnessed.View image in fullscreenBen Giles at Ultima headquarters near Cardigan.Photograph: Dimitris Legakis/Athena PicturesIf you start to see the world through its stains and messes you cannot give back this special insight, an understanding of the human experience that is both privileged and discouraging. Giles would advise, where possible, to try not to die beside a radiator or an electric fire. The quickest postmortem clean-ups happen outdoors, on arterial roads, where a balance must be struck between respect, public safety and getting backed-up traffic moving. He can identify the sound of maggots eating a corpse: “Like the sound you hear when you push saliva in and out of your teeth with your mouth closed.” He was jet-washing the front of a train, once, when a dismembered hand fell down from under the skirting. He has scoured the pebble-dashed exterior of a farmhouse, trying to differentiate body matter from protruding jewels of red granite.Hand dryers v paper towels: the surprisingly dirty fight for the right to dry your handsRead moreGiles was called to the scene of a murder a few years ago, and directed to remove a woman’s blood from window blinds, door handles, the inside of cutlery drawers. The woman had been killed by her husband. The part Giles couldn’t fathom, then or now, was that when they found the guy he was sitting in his local pub. Giles’s wife, Linz, told me that that was the only time she’d really worried about his mental health. Linz was stood in her own kitchen when she described to me all the places where Giles found blood. She ran a finger under the kitchen counter. She gestured at the sealed circular rim of the washing machine, the little sink lights. “For days, he couldn’t talk about it.”He told me he only started contemplating the psychological impact of all this when he sat down to write his book. “Balcony in Tenerife, glass of white wine, and I’m almost in tears, thinking about it.” He wasn’t sure it was helpful to dwell. He has to be able to touch anything, treat a carcass like a carcass, never seeing the consciousness that resided there earlier. Coming away from Mwnt beach, Giles seemed a little overwhelmed by the effort.As we drove, he quoted Genesis, as if to remind himself of fundamentals: “For dust you are and to dust you will return.” Between those times, we sweep up. We scrub. We pass around panaceas for stains and we tell each other that almost any mess can be corrected. Let streaks of mud dry, then scrape. Treat oil paint quickly – use turps. Be literal and work a rubber eraser over pencil marks. Soap and sunshine are supposed to be effective on spilled coffee. Salt ink. Salt mucus too. Giles must have seen me fiddling with the yellow pollen stain on my sweatshirt. “Don’t rub it,” he advised. “Vacuum out as much as you can. Most pollens are acids, so you’ll want an alkali cleaning product next.” He listed a few.Listen to our podcastshereand sign up to the long read weekly emailhere.Explore more on these topicsThe long readCrimeWalesHygienefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Here’s why you should read themChris PowerBen Markovits, David Szalay, Kiran Desai, Andrew Miller, Susan Choi and Katie Kitamura’s books will all take you on enthralling journeys‘Brilliantly human’: Kiran Desai and David Szalay make Booker prize shortlistTue 23 Sep 2025 15.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 23 Sep 2025 15.02 EDTShareTheBooker prizeis both a serious and celebratory undertaking. It should be, anyway, for those who care about literature, and I’ve certainly found it to be so since I began reading this year’s submissions on a stormy Devon beach on New Year’s Eve (fun, but subsequently I relied on the books, not ambient conditions, to provide the drama).Now the shortlist is decided, I and my fellow judges – our chair, Roddy Doyle, who won the prize in 1993, the novelists Ayòbámi Adébáyò and Kiley Reid (both previous longlistees), and the actor, producer and publisherSarah Jessica Parker– struggle to believe 153 books have become just six, and that our monthly meetings to discuss form, content and font size are at an end.But our journey with this handful of extraordinary books continues, and journeys define them all in certain ways. In The Rest of Our Lives, by Ben Markovits, the law school professor Tom Layward drives his daughter to college and doesn’t stop, embarking on a pan-American odyssey that’s also an exploration of the self. Markovits’s America is peopled by divorcees who, like Dante’s pilgrim, have reached the middle of their lives only to discover they’re lost. The book is very funny and very sad, and Tom is a brilliantly realised character; someone you want to both listen to and argue with.You might also find yourself wanting to argue with István, whose life story unfolds in David Szalay’s novel Flesh. But given that he’s someone who makes the phrase “a man of few words” seem wildly over the top, it probably wouldn’t last long. From his teenage years in Hungary to a tour of Iraq, his time as a doorman, driver and bodyguard, and his ascension to the ranks of the super-rich, István’s compelling story offers a striking portrait of modern Britain and explores desire and the limits of agency in prose stripped almost to the bone. This is a novel that shows how strongly character can be evoked with only scraps of what is typically the novel’s bumper crop: interiority.Kiran Desai’s The Loneliness of Sonia and Sunny covers a much briefer span of time than Flesh– it begins in the mid-1990s and ends around 2002 – but has the feel, and at nearly 700 pages, the size, of a multigenerational epic. For all the book’s great scope, though, no detail is too granular to escape Desai’s notice. Through the love story of its two main characters, Indians torn between America and home, the book explores and enacts the tension between two paths for Indian fiction, social realism and magical realism, and fuses them to original and enthralling effect.Social faultlines are everywhere in Andrew Miller’s The Land in Winter, set in the West Country during the punishing winter of 1962. Miller moves hypnotically between the surface of things – the work of a rural GP, of an inexperienced dairy farmer, of a woman discovering the demands and empty stretches of housewifery – and the deep currents of their desires. The two couples at the centre of the novel are as frozen as the landscape in which Miller places them, but huge changes are coming for them all – and the country in which they live.The major change in Louisa Kang’s life – her near drowning, and the loss of her father – is described right at the outset of Susan Choi’s Flashlight, which proceeds to chart the events leading to and resulting from that calamity. This is both a historical novel on a grand scale, beginning in immediately postwar Japan and ending more or less in the present day, and a deeply intimate one. Through the interrelations between Louisa and her parents, the Korean Japanese academic Serk and white American Anne, Choi gives us a deeply affecting account of a family spinning in history’s wake.A mother, father and child also occupy the centre of Katie Kitamura’s Audition. Or do they? This challenging, ingenious novel, in which things are tense, verging on menacing, from the first page, begins with an actor, in rehearsals for a new Broadway play, having lunch with a young man who believes she is his mother. As well as being about the relationship between parents and children, this is a novel that takes our claims for art – that it opens a space of possibility, probes at taboos, shows us other ways of being – and makes them thrillingly literal. Like all its companions on this year’s shortlist, the questions and moods it summons live on long after the book is closed.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

But there is also an upside to the alarming scenes recently witnessed in London: the alliance between billionaires, thugs and other opponents of change has come out of the shadows.The global environmental context is key to understanding what is happening in the UK, the US and other countries where the far right is becoming more vocal, violent and lavishly funded than at any time in memory. But that climatic analysis has been lost in much of the coverage of this phenomenon, which has focused on the narrow, local concerns that provided the spark but not the fuel.To step back to my distant vantage point in the Brazilian Amazon, that is as shortsighted as blaming the record outbreak of wildfires here over the past 12 months solely on those who lit the matches, while ignoring the more significant fact that decades ofdroughtand rising heat, particularly in the past two years, have left the rainforest more flammable than at any time in history.Biologists tell me that when trees get too hot or too stressed for prolonged periods, their primary coping mechanism is to shut down their periphery. They shed leaves so that any remaining moisture can be cycled inside the trunk and branches. This can sustain some individual species for a short time, but only at the risk of their long-term health and the resilience of the forest.Shedding leaves weakens a tree’s ability to interact with the outside world. It loses capacity to cycle water and carbon. It also opens up the forest canopy, allowing more sunlight and heat to reach the understory and suck the moisture out of the soil and the fallen leaves. This degrades the ecosystem to still more stressful levels, and turns normally damp undergrowth into a tinderbox. The only hope for salvation is rain.When human societies get too hot or too stressed for prolonged periods, we are theoretically smart enough to come together and invent a range of survival techniques and technologies. Recent history, however, suggests that the first instinct of many individuals is to also shut down their periphery – “close the borders”, “build walls”, “impose tariffs”, “stop the boats” – in an attempt to conserve jobs, food and money for themselves. Stirring up hatred against foreigners is a typical manifestation of this logic, which in turn risks becoming eco-fascistic.A moment’s consideration reveals this to be self-defeating. When economies cease cycling labour and goods, then supply declines and prices rise. When societies stop exchanging ideas and support, they become more exposed and less likely to find solutions to the bigger problems that are at the root of their stress. Left isolated for too long, they wither and die. Or self-combust.Unlike for trees, movement is one of the most effective survival strategies available for humans, which shows the analogy goes only so far. But both forests and societies are under more stress as a result of the climate crisis. And both are becoming more combustible, which is why the incendiary rhetoric of the US billionaire Elon Musk is not just reprehensible, but sinister.As I havewritten elsewhere, extreme weather and extreme politics are intertwined. First, because the latter feeds off the fear and uncertainty caused by the former. Second, because global climate action against big emitters has provoked resistance by billionaire individuals, companies and petrostates, who are pouring money into campaigns to deny, delay and distract. And third, because many of the ultra-rich are indeed apocalyptic in their visions of the future but they have given up on global solutions and would rather invest in theirindividual doomsday bunkers.Viewed in this light, the rabble-rousing of far-right demagogues makes perfect – if grotesque – sense. Donald Trump publicly declares the climate crisis a “huge hoax”, which plays well with his oil company donors. Yet many of his actions as president are consistent with the most apocalyptic visions of a hothouse Earth. He has threatened to annex Canada and Greenland, two regions of the world likely to escape the worst effects of global heating. He has closed down or defunded many of the US government’s climate science programmes, which will keep the public in the dark about what is happening. And he has ramped up internal security forces, which are increasingly criminalising climate protests. In deed, if not in word, his climate denial appears either opportunistic or downright fake.The great fear of Trump and his billionaire backers in the petrochemical and infotech industries appears to be that humanity could come together to find a solution to shared problems. For them, this would mean regulation, stagnation and higher taxes on the rich.This helps to explain what is happening the UK, where a foreign billionaire – Musk – risks stirring up hatred against foreign asylum seekers. Speaking by video link at the “unite the kingdom” rally earlier this month, the Americantold the London crowd: “Whether you choose violence or not, violence is coming to you. You either fight back or you die, that’s the truth, I think.”It was also Musk whopaid the legal feesof the far-right anti-immigrant campaigner Stephen Yaxley-Lennon – who goes by the name Tommy Robinson – claimed his supporters, and then used his X social media platform to raise the public profile of the founder of the race-baiting English Defence League. It need not always be overt. X is also among the social media that ramps up clips of inter-racial conflict before major elections. The constant repetition of images that we live in a climate of violence is enough to stir up fear, hostility and support for “strong leaders”.The motive appears to be to divide and distract, particularly when it comes to the polycrisis of climate, nature and inequality. Billionaires such as Musk have an outsized responsibility for these existential global problems, prompting growingcriticismfrom the pope and anti-poverty NGOs includingOxfam.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

But the intellectual ethos of Silicon Valley has shifted as tech billionaires feel increasingly under pressure for their eye-popping accumulation of wealth and carbon emissions. Some buildspace rockets, others invest in doomsday bunkers or mega yachts – all of which can double as escape pods if the climate gets too hot or the masses too rowdy. Increasingly, they are also funding social media sites, news companies, lobby groups and far-right politicians to resist any suggestion that the global economy may have stretched beyond the carrying capacity of the Earth.Take Musk’s business partner Peter Thiel, the Silicon Valley co-founder of PayPal, Palantir and Founders Fund. He was credited as the “kingmaker” for Trump’s first election victory and has more recently beendescribedas the “intellectual architect of Silicon Valley’s contemporary ethos”. In an apocalypticinterview with the New York Timesthis summer, he railed against the “peace and safetyism” of the past 50 years, equated the climate campaigner Greta Thunberg to the antichrist and warned that Europe was in the grip of an environmentalist ideology, which he called a “green thing”.View image in fullscreenPeter Thiel railed against the ‘peace and safetyism’ of the past 50 years.Photograph: Rebecca Blackwell/APThe talk of Armageddon is nothing new in American politics, but – given the worsening climate and extinction context – it adds to the feeling that the debates about energy transition and ecological limits may be entering an end game.Optimists see the rants of Trump, Musk and Thiel as the dying howls of a system that has outlived its usefulness. Outside the US and UK, there are signs of change and resistance, particularly in the global south. China’s huge investments in renewable power are expected to very soon start driving the world’s carbon emissions on a downward path, which will strand a great deal of oil industry assets. The Brazilian government and supreme court have defended its forests and democracy with rigour, punishing illegal land grabs, locking up its former leader Jair Bolsonaro for plotting a coup and successfully facing down Musk over compliance with local laws. Throughout the world, a huge majority of people want their governments to take stronger action on the climate crisis, asthe 89% projectshows.Here in the forest, it is obvious that communal action is essential. As individuals, there is simply no viable path to survival. Single trees might resist drought a little longer by shedding leaves and shutting down some of their interactions with the outside world. But to recover and thrive they ultimately need rain and nutrition – which can only come from healthy ecosystems. The same is true for humans. Whatever the likes of Musk, Thiel and Trump might want people to think, the future depends on interdependence.Rather than whipping up flames, responsible global citizens should be dousing down embers. If you want democracy, you have to defend it. If you want a healthy environment, you have to stand up for it. That has never been more true than now, though this historical lesson seems to be better understood today in the Amazon rainforest than in the home of the mother of parliaments, or the self-proclaimed Land of the Free.Explore more on these topicsEnvironmental activismView from the AmazonClimate crisisThe far rightProtestcommentShareReuse this content"

One thing is certain. We have a powerful shortlist here. The competition is generational. But this is also the elite, the god tier. And as ever there must be a winner.Was it the first nauseating thing at the Théâtre du Châtelet; the crowd of otherwise normal Parisians transformed into fame‑zombies, thronged against the barriers four hours before the ceremony, whooping and gawping as bored-looking blokes moved broadcast boxes around, baying at passing female TV presenters, spectating the buildup to an awards do in a state of celebrity delirium?Ousmane Dembélé and Aitana Bonmatí land Ballon d’Or awards as England duo honouredRead moreOr was the most nauseating thing the pre-ceremony outrage in the French media, who railed at thissoiree de foliebecause Paris Saint‑Germain had to play an actual football match the same evening, postponed from Sunday because of storms, rather than being present at a fancy party, a state of fomo that seems a little at odds with the new humble non-ego PSG.Was it just the wider phenomenon, the sense of some peak moment of personality cult, the confusion of talent with virtue, the superhero-ising of people who just happen to be very good at sport? Or is it the way awards culture coincides perfectly with the model that football’s owners want to impose, the move towards names, brands, individualism, that are so much easier to buy and sell than the old anchor points of place, culture and badge-loyalty?See for example Fifa’s Club World Cup. See also the newest award on Monday night, the team action prize. The title suggests some vision of collectivism and humility; in reality this was basically the words “Yamal”, “Messi”, “Mbappé”, “Brazil” and “PSG” and an online shortlist that reads like the most cynically engineered act of SEO catnip. Reading it you wondered why “Britney Spears”, “What Time Is It Now” and “Dogging sites in Kent where are” weren’t also up for gongs.Maybe it was the funny stuff at the ceremony that stood out. Early on a multilingual sexy singer appeared and sang a multilingual sexy song which seemed at one point to be actually called Multilingual Sexy. To be fair, this was also just very French. And Charlotte Cardin, who is Canadian, was great, creating energy out of nothing on an empty stage.View image in fullscreenHannah Hampton of Chelsea (right), fellow award-winner Gianluigi Donnarumma of Manchester City (left) and Gianluigi Buffon.Photograph: Benoît Tessier/ReutersSo that was one good bit. As was the sight of that iconic duo DJ Snake and Javier Pastore wandering on stage so that Javier could give a really earnest meandering speech while Snake stood next to him looking cool. Snake eventually did some PSG rabble-rousing before having to announce, to his own obvious battlement, that actually Arsenal Women had won team of the year, because in fact this isn’t just a PSG-hype event. The crowd booed the Arsenal players. Snake snuck back to his snug. Mainly you felt gutted for Snake. Don’t do Snake like that.Or maybe it was all of these things. Maybe everything was equally nauseating and everyone gets to be a winner. Except, of course, this is never the full story. This is what happens with elite modern football. Just when you think you’re done with the whole thing, just when it seems to have entered the arena of the unreal, that’s then football will pull you back in, like the serial adulterer narco don husband who buys you supermarket flowers and saysNoreen I’m still the man you fell in love with,and dammit he’s right. Stop it football. Stop re-seducing me.There were a few things that did this. Sarina Wiegman: yes, a good football person. Gianluigi Buffon beaming as Hannah Hampton got her award, like a goalkeeping Gandalf. Mainly, though, the thing that did this was Ousmane Dembélé winning the men’s Ballon d’Or, the most hyped award of the night.5:48'I wasn't planning on crying': Ousmane Dembélé and Aitana ­Bonmatí win Ballon d’Or awards – videoThis is the same Dembélé who plays for a state project. And the same Dembélé whose Ballon d’Or captures the beauty of that enduring paradox, the way football continues to house irresistibly relatable human qualities no matter how you stretch it thin or inject it with toxins. Here we have not just a wonderful footballer but an uplifting human story, embodied in a nice man who just happens also to have had a brilliant year in a brilliant team. And yes, football, we’re back on. For now.There is a trap here, too. Don’t go too far. Don’t go Full L’Équipe. Don’t make out Dembélé is both Football Jesus and a one‑man tactical “school” because he did a lot of high-speed pressing. Don’t talk too much about the “fulfilment of a tortuous destiny” which shows that “all stories are possible”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It’s not Ousmane versus the machine, or a case of Agent Dembélé, as online Real Madrid avatars have been quick to crow, the ruinously expensive underperformer who has now seen off the La Masia golden child. The world must always be binary, and Lamine Yamal has been unavoidably part of Dembélé’s triumph. There is something genuinely galling about the post‑ceremony online outrage, the idea this preternaturally talented 18‑year‑old, already enriched beyond reason, fawned over by adults, wheeled around in his bath chair like a golden princeling, is in some way being victimised by not having another gong forced into his hands.The fact is Lamine Yamal is also an underdog story, a kid from humble origins with nothing but talent to carry him. He is already, on pure brain-melting talent, the best player in the world. He will go on to win loads of these things. But he would also have been the youngest winner by three years. When the reigning holder of that mark won it, the original Ronaldo, he had just scored 47 goals in a season for Barcelona and 15 in the year for Brazil. And yes the counter to this is that no other player makes you feel like Lamine Yamal, that he is an extraordinary avatar of individualism in a systems-dominated game.View image in fullscreenLamine Yamal is also an underdog story, a kid from humble origins with nothing but talent to carry him.Photograph: Mickael Pinta/Zuma Press Wire/ShutterstockBut this also doesn’t stop Dembélé being the right winner of the Ballon d’Or and in a way that is not just logical but also redemptive. Dembélé is also a victory for feeling. Like Lamine Yamal he is an exhilarating footballer, blessed with rare technique, a scorer of brilliant goals, and now the dominant attacking presence in PSG’s trans-European treble.He has done this late in his football life, and done it when he really didn’t have to. A year ago he was out of the PSG team. Three years ago he was being hauled off in a World Cup final after a devastatingly bad 40 minutes. At Barcelona there was a meanness in his characterisation as lazy, disorganised, a junk food product, surrounded by feckless street-kid friends. In this context, the brilliance of his turnaround is that it is born out of hard work, team play, wildly committed pressing and tactical intelligence. It’s a victory for good management. And also for people getting on with each other, for turning the manager who dropped him after a row into the manager who has transformed his professional existence.Dembélé’s Ballon d’Or says: nothing is set, that it is still possible to reach out into the corners of your own talent. And it is also possible to do this if, like Dembélé, you’re not a conventional alpha sport-dog but someone who has known doubt and uncertainty, who is notoriously wry and funny rather than loud and flash. At the end of which we have a 28‑year‑old man crying at a podium, hugging his mum, showing vulnerability in his moment of straight-line triumph. And doing it all in the middle of the most cynically overmarketed festival of nausea.Dembélé may or may not be back on that stage, may still be part of aQatari projectin the most gerrymandered league in Europe. But he may also be enough to make you fall back in love, just a little, with this wildly alienating, oddly human sport‑industrial complex.Explore more on these topicsBallon d'OrParis Saint-GermaincommentShareReuse this content"

But it wasn’t unpredictableNils PratleyTightly run DIY retailer benefits from trade customers and good weatherB&Q owner lifts profit forecast amid strong demand for kitchensTue 23 Sep 2025 12.51 EDTLast modified on Tue 23 Sep 2025 16.17 EDTShareThe UK and France, according to the popular script, are living beyond their means and their citizens must brace for tax rises, spending cuts and all manner of confidence-sapping measures. So it ought to be a horrible time to be a retailer whose biggest market is the UK and whose second largest is France. Throw in a product range that is heavy on kitchens and bathrooms, where a purchase can usually be deferred until next year, and you’ve got a recipe for weak trading, right?Such thinking was presumably whyKingfisher– owner of B&Q and Screwfix in the UK and Castorama and Brico Dépôt in France – was among the most heavily shorted stocks in the FTSE 100 index by hedge funds going into Tuesday’s half-year numbers. If you want to bet against an economy, or two at once, a large and widely owned DIY retailer is a logical place to start in theory.UK retail shares fall amid fears of squeeze in consumer spendingRead moreThe practice is harder. Far from bemoaning its lot,Kingfisherreported an underlying gain of 1.9% in like-for-like sales in the half and said sales of kitchens and bathrooms were going splendidly in the UK.Forecasts for full-year pre-tax profits were raisedto the “upper end” of the previous £480m-£540m range. The cash forecast was even stronger, allowing the existing £300m share-buy programme to be accelerated. The shares improved by 15%, a jump probably assisted by short-sellers covering their positions.The moral of this tale is probably threefold. First,DIYretailing has unique features. An early spring and a warm Easter, as this year, can make a difference – think plants and garden furniture. About 28% of business across Kingfisher also comes from trade customers these days, and their behaviour is critical: they visit three times as often as regular punters and spend three times as much on average.Second, it’s dangerous to assume consumer sentiment is uniform. Supermarket executives talk about a “70/30” market where the proportion of customers who are pulling in their spending is definitely increasing, but the majority are still feeling fine. It is why “Aldi price match” and premium ranges can simultaneously be strong. In a DIY context, it may explain the big-ticket phenomenon: housing transactions have been stable and mortgage affordability, lest we forget, has still improved slightly because real wages have risen and interest rates have fallen (a bit).The third factor is simply that Kingfisher is a tightly run business, especially in the UK. Screwfix, the most trade-focused end of the operation, is miles ahead of its closest competitors. At B&Q, the return of an installation service has clearly boosted the kitchens and bathrooms side and it is not unhelpful thatHomebase went into administrationlast year. The French operations are weaker but a self-help restructuring plan started there a year ago. Retailers, even large ones, aren’t simply prisoners of their market.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Kingfisher’s boss, Thierry Garnier, said he was “mindful of mixed consumer sentiment and political uncertainty”. But bearish bets are also about timing and picking the right stock. Kingfisher is basically a resilient business that generates cash in most conditions and pays a good dividend to shareholders.

Now will international law die in Gaza too?Raji SouraniThere is a UN convention for exactly this kind of horror: the convention for the prevention and punishment of the crime of genocide. When will the world act on it?Raji Sourani is the coordinator of the Palestinian legal team at the international criminal court (ICC)Tue 23 Sep 2025 10.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 23 Sep 2025 10.22 EDTShareIsrael has committed and continues to commit genocide in Gaza. That is the conclusion ofa UN commission report. Since the release of the report last week,Palestine has finally been recognisedas an independent state by the UK and a number of other countries. In his announcement at the weekend, Keir Starmer called the death and destruction in Gaza “utterly intolerable”. This recognition comes too late and is still conditional, but has the UK government indeed now stopped tolerating Israel’s devastation of Gaza? Has anything changed for the people there who are being starved and bombed? Far from it.Even as the UN publishes the findings of its independent commission, anda flag is raisedoutside the Palestinian mission in London, mass displacement and killing continues to take place in Gaza City asIsrael attacks. As a lawyer who has spent my life believing in the rule of law, this makes me wonder: will Gaza’s destruction also bring with it the death of international law?From the very beginning, all one had to do was look at the words of Israel’sleadersto see that the intent to commit genocide was there. Israeli ministers andpoliticians promisedthat Gaza would be flattened, placed under siege and starved. The bombardments have been merciless and wide, targeting schools, homes and hospitals. And the majority of Israel’s victims arechildren and women. Maiming, starvation, lack of medical care and death have been people’s daily experiences in Gaza. Nobody has acted to stop it.Palestinian suffering has been livestreamed for the world to watch. Israel has shown exactly what it is doing to trapped Palestinians. Despite thekilling of many brave journalists, others have continued to show the reality: the genocide has been broadcast straight to your screen at home. Still, governments around the world haven’t stopped it.Palestinian groups documenting the atrocities – including the Palestinian Centre for Human Rights (PCHR), of which I am director, well as the Al Mezan Center for Human Rights andPalestinian rights organisation Al-Haq– have beentargetedbyIsraeli airstrikesandsanctionedby the US Treasury for documenting legal evidence of the crimes being committed. Even theUN special rapporteurFrancesca Albanese and international criminal court (ICC) officials – including chief prosecutorKarim Khan– are being threatened and sanctioned for speaking out about their findings. These findings match those in thePCHR’s newest report: that the intent to commit genocide was there from October 2023 onwards, evidenced by the testimony of the very survivors and victims that we should have been protecting.The UN’s commission now joins the wide consensus that Palestinians in Gaza have been experiencing genocide. This is a welcome intervention. But it is also crucial to remember that the purpose of thegenocide conventionis in its full name:the conventionon the prevention and punishment of the crime of genocide. The philosophy for it was to be preventiveandpunitive – which means we are at a crossroads now. This genocide was not prevented, but it can still be stopped. Will this be enough for people to act? Or will the pounding of Gaza also turn the principles of international law into rubble?I speak not just as a Palestinian, but as a lawyer who spent the last 48 years practising, and believing in the sanctity of, law. I devoted my life and expertise to this, because in my heart I felt there must be something to protect, and that the law would serve the most vulnerable people. But what we have been shown in governments’ inaction and complicity is an ugly reality. We may be looking at a new world where international law is selective and politicised.A genocide in our time with this level of mass killing, destruction, pain and suffering shows how fragile the rule of law is. Arrest warrants issued by the ICC has not prevented a genocide. Yet another institution finding thatIsraelis committing genocide has not stopped it. The law can only exist if it is enforced and applied to all. The facts are there, the law is there. No one can claim they didn’t know. As a society, we cannot allow international law to die in Gaza by allowing Israel’s impunity.As more institutions come to the same conclusions, I can only hope that more pressure is put on governments who are still aiding and providing arms to Israel. For these declarations and recognitions to offer any tangible hope to the people of Gaza, they must come with comprehensive action. The states who have been reluctant must follow Spainin taking a clear positionby instigating an arms embargo. The cover and partnership offeredby the UKand US to Israel for its genocide must stop.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It’s not reinvention but an ethical intentTue 23 Sep 2025 13.59 EDTLast modified on Tue 23 Sep 2025 16.17 EDTShareSir Ed Davey’sconference speechwasn’t a reinvention of the Liberal Democrats. But it was a rare attempt to reframe a party’s purpose before events impose one. The pivotal moment came with Gaza. “What is unfolding in Gaza is a genocide,” he said – the first UK-wide party leader to use the term so unequivocally from the conference stage. Though used in a recentparty press release, the word undoubtedly travels further spoken live. In saying it, he voiced what many progressives have felt for months but haven’t seen from a major political leader – a moral line drawn in the sand, in sharp contrast with Sir Keir Starmer’s studied vagueness.In ordinary times, this might seem risky. But these are not ordinary times. The political map is fracturing.Reform UK istopping many polls. Labour’s support is dropping. The Conservatives are braced for historic defeat. No major party can confidently say what the next few years or months will bring. Into that vacuum, Sir Ed calculates that moral clarity is more valuable than ideological caution.Significantly, in the speech he chose to spell out a centre-left policy agenda. There was a cancer treatment guarantee, better support for carers – while namechecking this newspaper’scampaign– and backing for green energy. These choices help define Sir Ed. They reflect a personal journey – rooted not just in his time as climate secretary in a coalition government but more pointedly in his ownexperienceof family loss and care. This personal history also provides a subtle rebuttal to Labour’s managerialism, a reminder that empathy and credibility still count.Sir Ed has alreadycalledfor the arrest of X owner Elon Musk, accusing him of “inciting far‑right violence on our streets” and running a social media platform that enablesself-harm, grooming and sexual exploitation. This wasn’t a casual provocation. In Tuesday’s speech Mr Musk – the biggestdonorin US politics – symbolised the forces that threaten democratic institutions and public safety. Here is a billionaire plutocrat who resistsoversight, undermines regulation andenables harm. In linking Mr Musk with Nigel Farage, Sir Ed cast big tech and the far right as a shared threat – and rightly demanded that the law catch up.In contrast to Labour’s timidity around Brexit, Sir Ed laid out a clear route to significant EU re-engagement:customs union, deeper trade alignment, and a way back to the single market. This will appeal toex-Toriesin the “blue wall” and Labour remainers still wondering what their vote gets them beyond promised competence. Perhaps the most important feature of the speech was who Sir Ed targeted – and who he did not. There were about 30 references to Mr Farage, whom he said would privatise the NHS and roll back gun laws. Donald Trump was invoked 24 times. But the prime minister? Not once.Sir Ed is fighting a three-front war: againstpopulism, against Labourcomplacency, and against irrelevance. Was he coherent? Not entirely. But perhaps coherence is a luxury in such fluid politics. In a splintering electoral landscape, Sir Ed’s ambition is clear: not to protest, but to contrast. His pitch is to be the party of ethical force – clear and unambiguous. It might work. The risk today in British politics isn’t misjudging the moment – it’s missing it altogether.Explore more on these topicsEd DaveyOpinionLiberal Democrat conferenceLiberal DemocratsLabourGazaNigel FarageElon MuskeditorialsShareReuse this content"

Emerging as the largest party in every general election since 1922, Welsh Labour has also won all six Senedd polls following devolution in 1999. In Tim Price’s acclaimed play,Nye, Aneurin Bevan declares: “I am a Welshman. I am a socialist.” For millions of voters in past generations, that merging of national and political identity was an everyday fact of life.This unique history lends some perspective to a remarkablepolllast week, which suggests that next May’s Senedd elections could deliver not so much an upset as a revolution. According to YouGov, the Welsh nationalists of Plaid Cymru narrowly lead voting intentions at 30%, with Reform UK one point behind. Labour are a dismal third on 14%. Next month a Senedd byelection in Caerphilly – in Labour’s traditional south Wales heartland – will offer an early indication of whether such an epic meltdown is truly on the cards. Polling this monthputthe party of Bevan in third place there as well.For Labour as a whole, this should be the mother of all wake-up calls. Local factors do apply. A donationsscandalthat enveloped the former first minister, Vaughan Gething, damaged the party’s reputation. NHS waiting lists – a devolved matter –remainfar too high. But Mr Gething’s successor, Eluned Morgan, is also paying the price for a failure to sufficiently distinguish Welsh Labour from the increasingly unpopular Westminster version. Labour’s refusal to lift the two-child benefit cap, and its ill-conceived attack on disability benefits, have seen swathes of progressive voters embrace Plaid as a more authentic advocate of classical social democratic values.Meanwhile, on the right, a Conservative party that made gains in the aftermath of Brexit risks has been utterly eclipsed by Reform UK. Though lacking high-profile personnel andambivalentat best over devolution, Reform does not share the historic toxicity of the Tory brand. Nigel Farage’s seductive promises ofreindustrialisationappear to be playing well in the valleys. The introduction of a new, more proportional votingsystemnext May, delivering 96 rather than 60 Senedd members, heightens the sense that Wales is on the threshold of a new political era.At a time of seismic disruption in British politics, and in liberal democracies across the west, the collapse of WelshLabourwould be a landmark moment. In the context of next May’s elections, it could prove to be an unhappy tipping point for Sir Keir Starmer’s leadership of the Labour party. But thus far there has been little sign of an adequate response to the scale of the challenge in either Cardiff or London.Invoking a “red Welsh way” distinct from Westminster’s priorities, Ms Morgan has demanded greater public investment from the centre into areas such as rail (a particular source of grievance after Wales failed to derive any consequentialbenefitfrom the billions spent on HS2 in England). Given the state of the polls, and his own darkening prospects, Sir Keir would do well to heed the call and come up with something radical. During more than a century of political hegemony, figures such as Bevan and Neil Kinnock have embodied Wales’s contribution as a powerhouse of traditional Labour values. That legacy is now under threat as never before.Explore more on these topicsWalesOpinionLabourReform UKPlaid CymruWelsh politicsWelsh governmenteditorialsShareReuse this content"

This very public Your Party row must stop now, 21 September).The far right is in the ascendancy, the government is selling England by the pound, inequality is growing by the day while our public services are in crisis, and Your Party are arguing about process before they have announced a single policy. They launched the group in July, but can’t even come up with a name. This is not what the country needs. Nor does it bode well for the kind of campaign Your Party would run, or for how they would govern if elected.The left needs its Zack Polanski, someone who is clear, concise and focused. While I believeJeremy Corbynis deeply principled and moral, he’s not a leader – and he doesn’t want to be. He is an appalling strategist and a worse tactician. If Zarah Sultana wants the job, Corbyn should let her get on with it. Decide on a name, decide on some policies, and let’s go – you can tweak the details later.It is precisely this kind of internecine factionalism that has prevented the left from presenting a coherent alternative to neoliberalism.After 45 years of unfettered neoliberal economic policies, including 15 years of so-called austerity, the stakes have never been higher. The country is hovering over the abyss, democracy is dying and huge swathes of the electorate are crying out for a genuine leftwing alternative.Your Party could get 25 MPs at the next election without even trying, but they’re throwing away the opportunity through stupidity, solipsism and selfishness.In the process, they are confirming the right’s perception that the left couldn’t organise the proverbial in a brewery. And this time, they will have a point.Paul CavaciutiEwell, SurreyYanis Varoufakis and Ken Loach are quite right to deplore the row over the founding of Your Party, but they must have been walking around with their eyes shut if they’ve failed to notice that theGreen partyhas been offering much the same socialist agenda for at least the last 10 years, with the added benefit of recognising that there is no social justice without environmental justice.It would save a lot of time and trouble if disaffected members of theLabourparty checked out the Green party manifesto and thought about joining an established party with a dynamic new leader, steeply rising membership and four excellent MPs already in place.Lorraine Du FeuCheltenham, GloucestershireThe idea for a new political party of the left is, contrary to the opinion of Yanis Varoufakis and Ken Loach, utterly terrifying to me. While Labour’s actions in government have disappointed lots of people, including its own voters, splitting the left even further virtually guarantees a victory for the Reform UK in 2029.The right has two options – Conservative or Reform. The left has Labour, Greens, Lib Dems, and now Your Party. The more we split, the less likely we are to win under our current voting system.I firmly believe the only way to defeat the right is to coalesce, and that may not be an ideal situation but it is all we have. Otherwise, Nigel Farage will be handed the keys to Downing Street and that is a danger that all of the left should be working together to fight.Paul WalmsleyLondonHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

On Thursday morning last week, I was profoundly challenged by the Gospel reading featuring three people: Simon the Pharisee, Jesus and a woman referred to as a sinner.The woman demonstrated an outpouring of love for God revealed in Jesus Christ. Her actions opened her to harsh judgment and condemnation, not least by Simon. While educated in the scriptures and the rules of his Jewish faith, he was unable to recognise the extravagant, abundant love of God in the man he had invited to sit at his table and eat. Adherence to the law was all-important, a sign of faith.I am outraged at the persecution, starvation and suffering experienced by the Palestinian people in Gaza, now identified by the UN as genocide, and by those in the West Bank. I have written to my MP urging stronger action. Like others, I have given in support of the Palestinian people. I have preached about the God who weeps at the pain and suffering endured, encouraging others to do what they can. Still, I feel powerless to effect meaningful change. Many people of all faiths and none share this pain and outrage.If I attend the march and am arrested, I will lose my licence to function as a priest in accordance with church regulations. If I don’t attend, and comply with national and church laws, am I no better than Simon the Pharisee? Jesus Christ reached out to the marginalised, taught us to feed the hungry, clothe the naked, visit those imprisoned and welcome the stranger.Ultimately, it is God who called me through Christ, and him that I must follow.

It was Liverpool’s sixth late winner in a seven-game winning sequence but their celebrations were tainted by Ekitiké receiving a second yellow card for removing his shirt. He will miss the visit to Crystal Palace on Saturday as a consequence of a dismissal for which Slot made no excuses.“The first one [for dissent] was already needless and, to a certain extent, stupid, as you have got to control your emotions,” the Liverpool head coach said. “With the second one I told him that if you score in the Champions League final in the 87th minute after outplaying three players and hitting it in the top corner … I can maybe understand he is like: ‘This is all about me.’ But I’m old-fashioned. If I scored a goal like this I’d have walked up to Federico Chiesa and said: ‘This goal is all about you, this is not about me.’ Needless, not smart, you call it stupid, I called it stupid right away as well.”Ekitiké was quick to apologise for his dismissal after the game. “It’s always the best to control your emotions. If you can’t, do it in a way that doesn’t lead to a yellow card,” the forward wrote on Instagram. “I was so excited tonight to help the team achieve another victory here … the emotion got the better of me tonight. My apologies to all the Red family.”Before kick-offLiverpool paid tribute to Matt Beard, the former manager of Liverpool Women whose death at the age of 47 was announced at the weekend. A period of silence was observed in memory of the coach who won two Women’s Super League titles with the club in 2013 and 2014 and promotion back to the top flight in his second spell in charge.Slot stuck to his promise to field a completely different lineup to the side thatwon the Merseyside derbyon Saturday. Leoni partnered Joe Gomez in central defence for his first appearance since a £26m summer move from Parma and the teenager was a towering, composed and alert presence.An impressive night’s work came to a horrible end, however, when the 18-year-old’s knee appeared to give way as he tumbled off the pitch late on. There are immediate fears of an anterior cruciate ligament injury. “Tomorrow he will probably have a MRI scan to see how serious it is,” Slot said. “Normally the emotions of a player tell you a lot. Let us hope for the best.”View image in fullscreenAlexander Isak (centre) is congratulated by Curtis Jones (left) and Rio Ngumoha after scoring his first goal for Liverpool.Photograph: Phil Noble/ReutersIsak could have had his first Liverpool goal with only 46 seconds on the clock. There were echoes of Russell Martin’s Southampton from last season when the visitors were caught taking too many risks at the back by Curtis Jones and Chiesa found the £125m striker free on the penalty spot. The goalkeeper Alex McCarthy, one of those responsible for inviting Liverpool pressure, atoned by blocking Isak’s goal-bound shot with his chest.The first‑minute exchange proved deceptive. There was no Liverpool onslaught. Instead, Southampton took the game to their Premier League hosts. Adam Armstrong drew a fine fingertip save from Giorgi Mamardashvili after a one-two with Ryan Manning.The Championship side should have taken the lead when Archer released Armstrong through on goal. The forward’s clipped effort sailed over Mamardashvili and struck the crossbar. No matter, Léo Scienza was first to the rebound and with only Leoni covering the Liverpool goal appeared certain to score. He steered a free header wide of the Kop goal from five yards out. Liverpool were ahead a minute later. Southampton’s punishment was entirely self-inflicted.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Chiesa read the goalkeeper’s telegraphed intentions and intercepted. The Italy international turned the ball back for the unmarked Isak to sweep a first-time finish around the Southampton keeper. It was to be the record signing’s final contribution as Slot eases the striker back to match fitness following his summer strike at Newcastle.Liverpool had more control after the interval with Ekitiké’s movement and Chiesa’s industry occupying Southampton, although sloppiness in possession continued to offer hope and space to the visitors. Southampton stunned Anfield by drawing level from a Manning corner.Quick GuideCarabao Cup: Gómez hits four for Brighton, Cardiff stun ClaretsShowDiego Gómez scored four goals asBrightonthrashedBarnsley6-0 at Oakwell.

Filip Jörgensen, the goalkeeper who came in after Robert Sánchez’s red card at Old Trafford, again struggled to dominate his area.Maresca said: “We knew already, we were aware, the game that we expect in terms of long balls, duels, throw‑ins, every time inside the box. I know that some of [my players], they didn’t play this kind of game [before]. I asked today, how many of them had played against League One teams. Then you know you need to play a different kind of game.”Asked if he had been obliged to deliver some harsh words to his players, he replied: “Absolutely, absolutely. And sometimes it’s more about desire … and we struggle. But if the next game is away to a League One or a League Two side, we need these experiences.”It was not rocket science. Lincoln’s predilection for a set-piece was signalled from the off. Receiving the kick-off, Freddie Draper, a Chelsea fan, teed the ball up with his first touch before volleying a veritable up-and-under to force the first of two long throw-ins. From the second hurled in by Tom Hamer, Chelsea only half-cleared, and Lewis Montsma cracked a near-perfect shot against the post.View image in fullscreenLincoln City’s Rob Street (right) opened the scoring for the League One side before Chelsea’s two goals soon after half-time.Photograph: Nigel French/PAThe stage was set. Lincoln, surging into third place in League One after a run of only one defeat in 12 games in all competitions this season, had nothing to lose; Chelsea, the club world champions, everything. Even with this much-changed lineup, the London club should have had too much for your average League One promotion hopefuls. But Lincoln are anything but average.Skubala’s team evidently believed in their game-plan. The club are still renowned for their run to the FA Cup quarter-finals nine seasons ago and showed that same underdog spirit in the first half here.The goal came from Lincoln’s ninth shot at goal, compared with Chelsea’s two at this stage. And while the breakthrough reflected Lincoln’s tactically timed ability to press, it also spoke of Chelsea’s carelessness.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Ivan Varfolomeev pounced to beat Trevoh Chalobah to the bouncing ball and fed Street, who composed himself to fire home. “To score in a game like this, against the world champions, is the stuff of dreams,” he said.“I’m really proud of the way the lads went about their work,” Skubala, the Lincoln head coach, said. “I’m really pleased with the first half and it could have been more than 1-0. We are adaptable and we changed shape, went 5-diamond-1 and really pressed with our No 8s and ‘put it on them’ first half – but it’s with design.Quick GuideCarabao Cup: Gómez hits four for Brighton, Cardiff stun ClaretsShowDiego Gómez scored four goals asBrightonthrashedBarnsley6-0 at Oakwell.

Otherwise the squad is largely as expected, including confirmation that Harry Brook, not Ollie Pope, will be vice‑captain to Ben Stokes when the first Test begins in Perth on 21 November.Next up, the Ashes – and England will need Ben Stokes at his all-round best | Ali MartinRead morePope’s untethering from that leadership role raises the possibility of Jacob Bethell breaking into a batting lineup that has played with freedom over the past three and a half years and rattled along at 4.5 runs per over. A run quicker than Australia during this period, albeit yet to win a major five-Test series, that figure is also a historical outlier among all nations.But perhaps the greater difference compared to recent Ashes tours is the presence of five seamers capable of hitting 90mph on the speed gun. Gus Atkinson, Jofra Archer, Brydon Carse and Josh Tongue are all named after featuring in the2-2 draw with India, with Mark Wood – arguably the quickest in the world – fit again after knee surgery in March.England have taken fast bowlers to Australia before, of course, a lineage that includes players such asHarold Larwood, Frank Tyson and Fred Trueman, or Andrew Flintoff and Steve Harmison more recently. Notwithstanding the lack of ball‑tracking before 2006, a quintet of such quicks this time around feels unprecedented, even if much will hinge on their fitness.Quick GuideEngland men's squadsShowEngland Men’s Test Squad (16 players):Ben Stokes (c), Jofra Archer, Gus Atkinson, Shoaib Bashir, Jacob Bethell, Harry Brook (vc), Brydon Carse, Zak Crawley, Ben Duckett, Will Jacks, Ollie Pope, Matthew Potts, Joe Root, Jamie Smith, Josh Tongue, Mark WoodEngland Men’s ODI Squad v New Zealand:Harry Brook (c), Rehan Ahmed, Jofra Archer, Sonny Baker, Tom Banton, Jacob Bethell, Jos Buttler, Brydon Carse, Sam Curran, Liam Dawson, Ben Duckett, Jamie Overton, Adil Rashid, Joe Root, Jamie Smith, Luke WoodEngland Men’s IT20 Squad v New Zealand:Harry Brook (c), Rehan Ahmed, Sonny Baker, Tom Banton, Jacob Bethell, Jos Buttler, Brydon Carse, Jordan Cox, Zak Crawley, Sam Curran, Liam Dawson, Jamie Overton, Adil Rashid, Phil Salt, Luke WoodWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Nine-day breaks after both the first and second Tests offer scope for recovery but rotation is also likely. As flagged previously, Matthew Potts has been included as an extra seamer, offering a more robust, fast-medium option. Chris Woakes was not considered for selection afterdislocating his shoulderduring the fifth Test against India.Markedly different to the side under Andrew Strauss thatlast won an away Ashes series in 2010‑11– more aggressive with the bat, less thrifty with the ball – there is growing optimism that this is England’s best chance since. Though an all-conquering side in recent times, defeat by South Africain the World Test Championship final this yearhinted at Australia’s vulnerability.Central to England’s chances of seizing on this possibility is the role Stokes can perform. The 34‑year‑old reannounced himself as a genuine Test all-rounder this summer – his best with the ball to date – but still ended it watching from the sidelines with a torn shoulder muscle. As per England’s press release, “he remains on track” for the start of the tour.View image in fullscreenJofra Archer (centre) will embark on his first away Ashes tour.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianWhile his place in English folklore was secured in 2019 – theWorld Cup finaland the famous Headingley Test – Stokes has unfinished business in Australia. After a promising debut there in 2013-14, he missed the4-0 defeat in 2017-18for legal reasons and had only recently returned from a mental health break for the pandemic-blighted defeat in 2021-22.Key, the team director, is due to explain the rationale behind the final spots on Wednesday, not least Jacks returning for the first time sincehis debut in Pakistan in 2022. Rehan Ahmed was one option, while Liam Dawson stood in for Bashir during the summer. Both have to settle for spots on the preceding white-ball tour of New Zealand in October.A more delicate subject will be Pope, who has been vice‑captain for three years and stood in for Stokes on five occasions, winning three matches.Brendon McCullum, the England head coach, hinted at a switch recently, highlighting Brook’s role as captain of the limited‑over sides and stressing that, even without an official title, every player can still act as a leader.However, after Pope experienced another frustrating series against India – a century to begin with, an average of 34 overall – the change may also suggest his spot is no longer a given. Bethell has the back-foot game for Australia, impressed in New Zealand last year,and made his maiden centuryat professional level in the recent ODI series with South Africa.This may be considered a so‑called “good headache” to have, with the batting lineup otherwise settled and pegged around the all‑time greatness of Joe Root. Beyond how many of the five Tests Archer and Wood can play – this will be the former’s first away Ashes tour – the biggest question mark is arguably the spinner, with Bashir still a work in progress.Quick Guide'I found out in 45 seconds': Kate Cross loses England contractShowEngland bowler Kate Cross has lost her central contract with the national team, saying her appraisal was a 'pretty savage day'.The 33-year-old has led England's seam attack since the retirement of Katherine Sciver-Brunt in 2023, but Cross (pictured) said she discovered 'within 45 seconds' of her appraisal last month that her contract was not being renewed.'I had gone in there armed with a lot of my stats and stuff to talk about and I didn't open my book, I didn't get a chance to,\" Cross told the BBC's No Balls podcast.'I thought how am I going to get through the appraisal without crying and then I had cried it out and got in there and within 45 seconds, I found out I wasn't getting my contract renewed so it all happened really quickly. It was a pretty savage day.'Lancashire and Northern Superchargers bowler Cross made her England debut in 2013, playing eight Tests, 76 ODIs and 18 T20s and taking 140 wickets.PA MediaPhotograph: Jason Cairnduff/X03805Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.The 21-year-old was identified for this tour two years ago, with his height and overspin, plus the footmarks created by Mitchell Starc, and deemed the closest to Nathan Lyon in terms of approach. But from 19 Tests of investment since there have been lurching returns, with Bashir claiming 68 wickets – includingfour five‑wicket hauls– but at 39 runs apiece.Even with uncertainty over their top three, Australia will doubtless look to target Bashir and force England’s seamers into bowling more overs. For the first time in a long time, however, those seamers will be coming in fast.Explore more on these topicsThe AshesEngland cricket teamAustralia cricket teamCricketAustralia sportnewsShareReuse this content"

The price is not disclosed, but based on recent valuations of Tottenham the shares are likely to have cost around £100m.Exits of Lewis and Levy will mean less ‘banging on the table’ at Premier League meetings | Matt HughesRead moreLord Ashcroft is a longstanding Tottenham shareholder who at one stage owned around 4% of the club. It was unclear on Tuesday night whether Ashcroft has sold his existing shares to his son, Andrew, or if the family have almost doubled their stake by buying from minority shareholders, who until last week owned 13.42% of the club between them.Tottenham’s majority shareholder ENIC, of which theformer club chairman Daniel Levyowns 29.88%, has not sold any of its shares and is adamant the club is not for sale. Levy left the board suddenly this month after 25 years as the club’s most senior director and has been replaced by Peter Charrington, a long-time adviser of the Lewis family who own ENIC, as non-executive chairman.Tottenham subsequently announced that they had rejected two preliminary expressions of interest in buying the club from Amanda Staveley’s PCP Capital Partners and an American/Chinese consortium led by Roger Kennedy and Firehawk Holdings Limited. Under takeover panel rules the club remain under the official offer period until 5 October, by which point PCP and the consortium must either make a formal offer for the club or announce they have no plans to do so.The takeover panel could compel the Ashcrofts to announce they are working together if there is evidence they are doing so. The takeover code states there is no presumption that family members with shares in the same company are acting in concert, but that they will be treated as doing so if there is evidence they are co-ordinating their shareholdings. Tottenham declined to comment.Andrew Ashcroft was based in Belize, where he owns a hotel and his father has substantial business interests, until 2021 when his then partner Jasmine Hartin was charged with manslaughter after accidentally shooting a police officer. Hartin was spared prison after pleading guilty, but Ashcroft obtained custody of their two children and moved to the Turks and Caicos Islands to launch a new business venture.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

At Bethpage, they are flogging 24-carat gold coins – 100 were available on Tuesday morning, presumably still are now – with Keegan Bradley’s signature attached. The price? $7,500 (£5,500). There must be an assumptionRyder Cupfans leave their senses at the gates.Money. The one subject the US Ryder Cup team would rather is not discussed this week and thetheme that Europe are more than happy to promote. As soon as it was confirmed the US team members would be paid $500,000 a head to play at Bethpage – $300,000 must be given to charity, the rest is a stipend – half of Luke Donald’s team talk was written. Europe play for their cause, their tour, their big picture. The US? Now quite easily portrayed as obsessed with dollar signs. Twelve players, $2.4m, zero caveats.‘I’m starting to get jealous’: Shane Lowry on McIlroy, ambition and the Ryder CupRead moreLast week, the Guardian contacted the representatives of all dozen US players to ascertain whether the “extra” $200,000 would also be donated to a charitable cause. Only one saw fit to reply, Patrick Cantlay’s representative explaining his client’s desire to assist “educational development for children of military veterans and first responders”. Cantlay spoke directly on the same theme on Tuesday morning. It is curious given the obvious optics of this situation that agents have no apparent desire to publicly manage the subject.Bradley has confirmed all of his $500,000 will go to charity. Xander Schauffele plans the same. So, too, doesScottie Scheffleralbeit the world No 1 was irritated to be asked about his approach here. “I don’t know if we’ve met before,” Scheffler said to his questioner in what is now a regular, passive‑aggressive tone. “But my wife and I, we like to do a lot of stuff in our local community and I’ve never been one to announce what we do. I don’t like to give charitable dollars for some kind of recognition.“We have something planned for the money that we’ll be receiving. I think it’s a really cool thing that the PGA of America has empowered us to do. I have a deep passion for the city of Dallas, I have a deep passion for the organisations that we support at home and I’m excited to be able to take this money and be able to do some good in our local community.”Beyond this small contingent of players, it is totally unclear where the funds will go. The weird lack of focus from the American media means it would be perfectly easy for golfers to spend their $200,000 on fast cars or living room furniture. Stranger still is that $200,000 represents chump change to the world’s leading golfers.Had the overriding idea been to increaseRyder Cupcharitable contributions, or even for players to choose specific causes, there was nothing to stop $500,000 per player being designated accordingly. Instead, there is ambiguity and the chance for Europe to go one‑up in the eyes of a watching public.View image in fullscreenLuke Donald, the Europe captain, has proudly pointed out that his team will donate their payments to charity.Photograph: Mike Egerton/PAThe European team, it must be recognised, are no paupers. If he has not done already, Donald will soon make hundreds of thousands from speeches at leadership seminars. Golfers are typically given bonuses from their sponsors for Ryder Cup participation. The sweaters Team Europe will wear at Bethpage retail for about £2,000.Donald, though, understandably plays on the sense of moral high ground. He had given the European team the option of receiving payment, one that was universally rejected. “I was very proud of the guys,” Europe’s captain said. “The ideals of the Ryder Cup was set up back in the 1920s by Samuel Ryder and I think he would have been proud, too.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

There is, however, the possibility of Bethpage being closed to spectators for at least part of Thursday.While weather for tournament days on Long Island is currently predicted as reasonable, Thursday is problematic. The PGA of America reacted to that situation on Tuesday afternoon. In a statement, they said: “Due to the forecast of inclement weather on Thursday, September 25, the Ryder Cup opening ceremony has been moved to Wednesday, September 24. The opening ceremony pre-show will begin at 3 pm with the opening ceremony set for 4 pm.“Ryder Cup+ ticket holders for Thursday will now be admitted both Wednesday and Thursday.“US captain Keegan Bradley and European captain Luke Donald will announce Friday morning's pairings as planned at 4 pm Thursday at a location to be determined.”Ewan MurrayWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Bradley portrays the financial issue as one aimed at bringing the Ryder Cup into the 21st century. Nobody knows what sporting event he is using by way of comparison. It is safe to say the PGA of America’s officials did not decide one morning to bestow millions of dollars on players. Instead, the impetus came from the golfers themselves.“I’m not concerned about what Europe does or what they think,” Bradley said. “I’m concerned about what my team is doing. I was tasked with a job the PGA of America asked me to do and this was what we decided. We copied a lot of what the Presidents Cup does.“We did the best we could and I think a lot of good is going to come from this. I think the players are going to do a lot of good with this money and I think it’s great.”Bradley may well be right. What is undeniable, though, is the pursuit of payment has added a dynamic to the Ryder Cup that the US will regret if Europe prevail in New York.Explore more on these topicsRyder CupScottie SchefflerLuke DonaldGolfUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I don’t think you can dwell on it because you have to be in the moment, you have to play the game in front of you, you can’t think about what happened three years ago. You have to be focused on what is ahead.”The back-row Sadia Kabeya added that she sees this final as a “completely new page” after being relatively new to the Red Roses squad in 2022, having won her first England cap in late 2021. “For me it was a weird one because I hadn’t played much in that World Cup,” Kabeya, who also came off the bench in the last final, said. “Injury brought me into the semi-final and the final and I was there to put the squad in the best place. The fact I was playing in the final was amazing but it was never in my plans. I just wanted to put my best foot forward.“When we did end up losing in that final, it didn’t hit me as much because of being new and not knowing as much about the history; I didn’t have that weight. Looking back, there are a lot of girls who have a lot of feelings about that final. I think because I was so young and new into it, it was a loss but not as monumental as it was for the other girls.“This time around there is a lot more in it for me, especially being more cemented in the squad and really connected with the girls. There are a lot of learnings but, for me, it’s a completely new page.”This week is big because it is a final but it is also being hosted at a sold-out Twickenham and it is expected to be aew attendance recordfor a women’s rugby union game.

Knowing that the majority of fans there are there to support them, to galvanise them and get behind them. I know you feed off of that energy, especially knowing what this game is going to be. It’s a cliche but they almost become the 16th person in those moments where you need them.

Bird, despite never having played a match for England, was, at his peak, instantly recognisable and transcended the game.Bird stood in 66 Tests and 69 men’s one-day internationals, including three World Cup finals, and was much admired for his decision making, but it was the idiosyncratic way in which he officiated – with a grin, an obsession with incoming rain, and an eccentric flair – which made him such a fan and player favourite.Dickie Bird obituaryRead more“He was a national treasure and I was fortunate to have shared some hugely enjoyable times with him over the years,” the former prime minister David Cameron wrote. “At 92 he had a good innings. Farewell friend.”Bird always seemed to be stalked by incident and accident – once leading the players off at Old Trafford after bright sunlight stopped play and sitting on the covers at Lord’s alongside spectators while the police investigated a bomb threat in 1973. He also claimed to have bumped into a bus conductor who was wearing the hat stolen from his head during the 1975 World Cup final, one of a string of anecdotes that filled his many books – he sold more than a million copies of his autobiography.Bird was born Harold in 1933, but nicknamed Dickie by a fellow pupil at Raley Secondary Modern, a name that stuck. He played cricket at Barnsley cricket club alongside lifelong friends Sir Michael Parkinson and Sir Geoffrey Boycott, who said in tribute that Bird was “loved by so many and became a legend”.Boycott added: “Players all over the world respected and admired him for his firmness, fairness and he did it with a sense of humour.”Bird went on to play first-class cricket for Yorkshire andLeicestershire, but it was as the man in the white umpire’s coat that he made his mark.View image in fullscreenDickie Bird rings the bell before play in the England v New Zealand Test at Lord’s in May 2015.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianHe was awarded an MBE for his services to cricket and later an OBE for his charity work, including with the Dickie Bird Foundation that he set up in 2004.Bird never married or had children, and struck a chord with thousands of people during the pandemic when, wearing hisYorkshireCCC anorak, he did an interview with the BBC. Aged 88, and isolating for a year, he talked about his loneliness and his daily garden exercise regime. “It’s been a fight, and I can understand the elderly people sitting in their chair and can’t be bothered to get out, but my advice please get out, if you just walk around the block, get out of the house.”He was made Yorkshire club president in 2014 and remained a huge supporter of the team, chatting away at the Scarborough festival this year. In tribute the club said he left behind “a legacy of sportsmanship, humility and joy and a legion of admirers across generations”.Those admirers stretched across continents, too, with the former India spin-bowler Anil Kumble noting: “Cricket lost one of its brightest souls. Dickie Bird didn’t just umpire the game – he owned it with heart, wit and class.” The former Australian cricketer Merv Hughes said Dickie was “one of the best” umpires “and a great bloke as well”.View image in fullscreenDickie Bird at home with his awards in 2013.Photograph: Gary Calton/The GuardianOnly 10 days ago, Bird was at Oakwell supporting his boyhood club Barnsley FC against Reading. The club were due to hold a minute’s applause in his memory on Tuesday night.He was given the freedom of the Borough of Barnsley in 2000, and sculptor, and friend, Graham Ibbeson was commissioned to make a statue of the town’s favourite son, which was unveiled in 2009. The statue was raised up on a plinth in 2012 after locals took to hanging the odd chip box from his raised index finger.Perhaps the final word should go to the Yorkshire poet Ian McMillan, poet in residence at Barnsley FC, who wrote a poem in Bird’s memory, “loving and sentimental like Dickie was”.It’s the final momentOf the final dayAnd time finger’s raisedAnd there’s a tear in the eyeCos past the floodlightsFlying highThere’s a lone bird soaringIn the Barnsley sky.Explore more on these topicsCricketYorkshireLeicestershirenewsShareReuse this content"

The France forward produced a Panenka penalty after Unai Elgezabal’s rash challenge, and then rounded Mat Ryan to score the fourth goal from Arda Guler’s pass.The result keeps Xabi Alonso’s side top of the table on 18 points after six matches, stretching their lead to five points over reigning champions Barcelona, who go to Real Oviedo on Thursday.

Minor tweaks to beloved theme songs, shuffles to commentary booths and analysis teams, new scoreboard graphics, even changes to the duration and placement of ad breaks: all of these can trigger days, sometimes even years, of volcanic debate. For a certain type of sporting masochist it’s possible to plug into corners of the online sportingverse that are still litigating, say, the chyrons from the 2010 NBA finals, or ESPN’s decision – originally made in 2011, reversed in 2017, then reinstated in 2020 – to cut ties with Hank Williams Jr and his legendary All My Rowdy Friends Are Here on Monday Nightintro songfor Monday Night Football.The outrage prompted by the latest upheavals at ESPN certainly fits the pattern of involuntary fan resistance to change, but on closer inspection this is more than a case of a few disgruntled cable TV subscribers reenacting the “old man yells at cloud” meme. In August ESPNannouncedit was bringing on Katie Feeney, a recent Penn State graduate with 14 million followers across YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, and Snapchat, to produce sports and lifestyle content – offering “a blend of on-site access, fashion, and culture”, as the press release put it – for the network’s main broadcasts and digital channels.Feeney’s hiring is the latest move in ESPN’s drive to appeal to younger viewers, all those sewn-to-their-phones and (presumably) lifestyle content-hungry Gen Z and Gen Alpha hordes unenthused by the stuffier news-and-dad-banter offering ofESPNmainstays like SportsCenter and Pardon the Interruption. In 2020 the network brought on sporting influencer Omar Raja, founder of the House of Highlights, as a digital commentator, and its in-house “creator program”, a kind of year-long fellowship for promising young influencers that acts as a beachhead for ESPN into the burgeoning creator economy, is now in its third iteration.On its surface, the new ESPN looks innocent enough, and the network is hardly alone in trying to get down with the kids and freshen its output with a spritz of youthful rizz: the NBA and other leagues have introduced creator programs, MLB has invested in the podcast network Jomboy Media, and Fox Sports is collaborating with Barstool Sports. (The founders of Jomboy and Barstool are hardly young – Dave Portnoy, for example, is in his late 40s – but the material these networks produce is designed to go big on social media and rope in younger fans.) On the one hand, this is just the way sports broadcasting operates now: what fans see on their screens emerges from a series of “partnerships” with off-the-shelf online brands and personalities, rather than reflecting something more innate and homegrown about the journalistic metabolism and personality of the network itself.How the rightwing sports bro conquered AmericaRead moreThe output from influencers like Feeney and Raja, only a small fraction of which makes it to air on ESPN’s cable programming, is a mix of fan interviews, “crazy” scenes live from the tailgate, sideline clips that reveal nothing surprising from the sideline (the general tenor of which is, “The game is about to start!” or “Wow, can’t believe I’m here!”), get ready with me reels, behind the scenes footage of famous ESPN broadcasters standing around looking at their phones, and minute-long “hot takes” that are so thumpingly uninteresting they seem designed to instantly kill any debate. (“My hot take is that if your favorite teams aren’t all from the same city, you’re not a real fan” was arecent offeringfrom Raja, to which the only reasonable response is: OK?)This stuff is all trivial and expendable by design, but it’s hardly offensive: anyone who consumes sports on the internet is inured to this type of garbage, and the social media platforms are awash with sugary, under-one-minute video hits of players building their ideal teams or pronouncing their own names or trying to execute the perfect dap or naming their favorite pasta. It’s not as if creators like Feeney and Raja, however much noise ESPN has made about hiring them, enjoy the kind of prominence on air during live broadcasts that a fellow influencer like Dave Portnoy, say, commands over on Fox. For the most part, these figures feel like summer interns in a world still dominated by the big beasts of gameday.On the other hand, influencer creep symbolizes a broader rot at the heart of ESPN. It’s important to set these moves in their proper context. In just the past 12 months the network has inked a new$100m, five-year deal with Stephen A Smiththat allows him to be even louder than usual; it’s snapped up Inside the NBA, perhaps the most universally admired talk show in American sports broadcast history, from TNT; and most tellingly of all, it’s reached a deal with the NFL, an organization it is nominally supposed to cover critically, that will see the league take a 10% equity stake in ESPN in exchange for the rights to the NFL network and the league’s popular RedZone channel.Taken together, these deals herald a major shift: away from the adversarial tradition of reporting that the Entertainment and Sports Programming Network once stood for, toward a much more accommodating and insider-driven approach to covering sports. ESPN’s embrace of the creator economy is part of this broader push for a cozier relationship with power. For years, ESPN has managed a conflict between its dual function as both a broadcaster and a news service, screening professional sports even as its in-house reporters subjected those same sports to aggressive journalistic scrutiny. That tension was always difficult to negotiate, but the disruptions of the smartphone economy, which has blitzed attention spans, pushed the epicenter of sports talk away from cable TV to social media, and handed more power to individual leagues, teams and athletes to shape and influence media narratives to their liking, have made live sport the absolute business priority for networks like ESPN.View image in fullscreenThe NFL is a huge part of ESPN’s business model.Photograph: Adam Hunger/APSeveral highly regarded journalists have left ESPN in recent years, as the paramount importance of live programming to the network has become clear and reporting has come to be seen as a privilege, or a burden, or sometimes both. Among those who have left are excellent reporters and writers such as Zach Lowe and Pablo Torre, who recently reached a licensing deal to produce Pablo Torre Finds Out, his excellent, eponymous investigative podcast, for the New York Times. This continues a decade-long exodus of similar talents from ESPN, including Colin Cowherd and Dan Le Batard, extending all the way back to Bill Simmons’s acrimonious departure from the network in 2015.Does ESPN care that they no longer have these personalities, all of whom have gone on to have successful careers after leaving the network, to enrich their programming and “content” around game days? Did the studio executives look on in envy as Torre unspooled his string of summer love scoops, from theBill Belichick-Jordon Hudson romanceto thehectic coupling of Kawhi Leonard and a tree-planting company? It seems unlikely. When they have Katie Feeney locking in the youth demographic withsponconfor Neutrogena Hydro Boost (“my go-to for hydrated, juicy skin”) and bringing viewers exclusive, behind-the-scenesfootageof what @SAWEETIE, “the first ever female curator for Monday Night Football”, would do as her touchdown celebration dance, what need does ESPN really have for the fussy old business of journalism? The stories all come from inside the locker room now, or directly from the players themselves: questions, criticism, scrutiny are anathema to ESPN’s fresh mission as a souped-up PR agency. There is stillworthy reportingthat comes out of the company’s creaking news arm but it’s clear that ESPN’s priorities now lie elsewhere.Increasingly, it seems like the old media model, in which the networks that broadcast live sport could do double duty as aggressive excavators of those same sports’ ugly truths, has passed. From now on, sports coverage is divided between two camps. On one side are the insiders, the broadcasters, the image-fluffers, fabulously well resourced and operated for mutual benefit in partnership with the sports world’s most powerful entities; on the other are the outsiders, the journalists, the critics, perpetually strapped for cash and digging for revelatory nuggets around a sporting-corporate PR machine that’s built to withstand the apocalypse. Where it once tried to keep a foot in both camps, ESPN now stands irrevocably on the side of the powerful: a company that once set the news agenda in sports is now just another sweaty social media setup fishing for quick clicks.With occasional noble exceptions,whatever sports “content” it produces from this day forward will be necessarily soft-focus and unchallenging.The vapidity of the new ESPN captures the crisis of modern sports media. In the attention economy, what exactly is the role of broadcast media during the lulls when sports are not being played live? For a shrinking corner of the professional commentariat, sport in its “dead” time is still something to subject to sustained critique and discussion, a topic appropriate for serious journalism and analysis. But for ESPN, sport has become fluff, visual candy cotton, an inexhaustible source of sugar in a contest for viewer-consumers’ addiction as endless as the feeds on our phones. Rather than pushing back against the easy tyranny of the vacant scroll, ESPN is giving in to it, trying to ride it – and the vision of a zonked-out, lobotomized viewership is captured perfectly in the network’s Black Mirroresquenew slogan, “Sports Forever”.By chasing dollars, ESPN is betraying the very fans on whose passion it has built its success, trading away its journalistic credibility for a diminished status as the glorified Pravda of the modern American sportscape. The network’s approach to covering sport now is properly post-journalistic, built on player access, highlights, fan experiences, viral squirts of memebrain swill skimmed from the trough of online trend culture, and zero contestation. It’s a strategy that elevates narrative management over entertainment, teams over viewers, money over truth. And increasingly, it feels like the future – a reality that should trouble anyone who cares about sports and the real stories that shape them.Explore more on these topicsUS sportsESPNUS television industryTelevision industrycommentShareReuse this content"

So this is something that science has proven, and these things should not be really questioned.”Wes Streeting, the UK health secretary, was even more direct in his criticism, telling ITV: “I trust doctors over President Trump, frankly, on this. I’ve just got to be really clear about this: there is no evidence to link the use of paracetamol by pregnant women to autism in their children. None.“So I would just say to people watching: don’t pay any attention whatsoever to what Donald Trump says about medicine. In fact, don’t take even take my word for it, as a politician – listen to British doctors, British scientists, the [National Health Service].”1:54Autism expert says Trump’s Tylenol claims ‘aren't based in fact’ – videoHours after Trump made his comments, the MHRA, the UK’s healthcare regulator, released a statement saying there was no evidence linking paracetamol use during pregnancy with autism.Dr Alison Cave, chief safety officer at the agency, warned that “untreated pain and fever can pose risks to the unborn baby” and it was important to manage these symptoms with recommended treatments.The European Medicines Agency also stuck by its guidelines. The EU agency’s chief medical officer, Steffen Thirstrup, said its advice was “based on a rigorous assessment of the available scientific data and we have found no evidence that taking paracetamol during pregnancy causes autism in children”. When asked, an EU commission spokesperson referred to the EMA findings.In Spain, the official body responsible for regulating medicinesissued a safety noticestating there was no evidence of a causal relationship between paracetamol use during pregnancy and autism in children, meaning one does not cause the other.Spain’s minister of health, Mónica García, dismissed Trump’s comments as science “denialism” that put lives at risk.The Therapeutic Goods Administration, the medicines regulator in Australia, confirmed paracetamol was safe for use in pregnancy and rejected the link to neurodevelopmental conditions.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Monday’s press conference appears to be an effort to provide results on the deadline Kennedy set himself, although he failed to give any new information backed by science.Experts say that finding the underlying factors of a complex syndrome that has been studied for decades was unrealistic.Autism diagnoses have been rising. One in 31 children aged eight had a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder in the US in 2022, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That compares with about one in 150 in 2000.Doctors believe there are two main reasons for the rise, and neither relates to vaccines or medication. First, the definition of autism has broadened. Second, parents have increasingly sought a diagnosis of autism, which has become better known publicly.In its assessment, theWhite House appears to be relying ona 2025review of 46 earlier studiesthat suggested an association between prenatal paracetamol exposure and an increased chance of neurodevelopmental disorders. Critically, those researchers said the study did not prove the drug caused the outcomes and advised that pregnant women should continue to use acetaminophen at the lowest possible dose and for the shortest possible period.Health experts have pointed instead toa large Swedish studypublished in 2024, which tracked 2.4 million births and found no evidence of an association between prenatal exposure to the drug and autism.Explore more on these topicsHealthDonald TrumpAutismVaccines and immunisationDrugsnewsShareReuse this content"

She gave birth to a son, Patrick, in London in 1958 and passed him off as a younger brother for several years while he was brought up by her parents.Claudia Cardinale: ‘I don’t want to stop’Read moreAfter a series of smaller roles, she shot to international fame in 1963 when she featured in Federico Fellini’s 8 1/2 while she also starred alongside Burt Lancaster in The Leopard in the same year.Shooting two films at the same time brought complications, with Cardinale recalling that she had to have different hair colours for the two roles.In an interview with the Guardian in 2013, Cardinale contrasted the approaches of directors Fellini and Luchino Visconti, who directed The Leopard. “He [Fellini] couldn’t shoot without noise. With Visconti, the opposite, like doing theatre. We couldn’t say a word. Very serious,” she said.Her growing profile opened the door to Hollywood productions and she appeared in the comedy caper The Pink Panther, directed by Blake Edwards, and Sergio Leone’s Once Upon A Time In the West in 1968.Cardinale’s career took a hit in the 1970s, after she separated from film producer Franco Cristaldi to start a lifelong relationship with filmmaker Pasquale Squitieri, with whom she had a daughter, also called Claudia. Cristaldi asked friends and associates in the Italian cinema industry to ostracise Cardinale, resulting for example in Visconti turning her down for his last film, The Innocent in 1976.“It was a very delicate moment. I discovered I had no money in my bank account,” Cardinale said about the period.Franco Zeffirelli eventually came to her rescue, casting her in the 1977 television miniseries Jesus of Nazareth. She then continued working with other European directors, including Werner Herzog and Marco Bellocchio.The husky-voiced, chain-smoking Cardinale had a reputation as a fiercely independent, free-spirited woman, who once defied Vatican protocol by showing up for a meeting with Pope Paul VI in a miniskirt.Based for much of the time in France, and friends with the presidents Francois Mitterrand and Jacques Chirac, Cardinale turned to the theatre around the turn of this century, winning plaudits for her appearances on the stage.She carried on making films in a variety of European languages until late in her life, appearing in the Swiss TV series Bulle in 2020.Awarded a lifetime achievement award at the Berlin film festival in 2002, she said acting had been a great career. “I’ve lived more than 150 lives – prostitute, saint, romantic, every kind of woman – and that is marvellous to have this opportunity to change yourself,” she said. “I’ve worked with the most important directors. They gave me everything.”Explore more on these topicsFilmFederico FelliniItalyEuropeShareReuse this content"

Authorities said Oak Grove Jane Doe was a petite white woman between the ages of 30 and 50. She is Oregon’s oldest unidentified victim.Oregon state police said the case went cold in the 1950s.“Critical evidence, including the victim’s remains, went missing from law enforcement custody, with no documentation of their disposition,” state police said.Discovery of the remains’ location was attributed to the Oregon state police medical examiner’s office’s Human Identification Program; Oak Grove Jane Doe was found under a headstone reading “Unknown Woman 1946” at Mountain View Cemetery in Oregon City.State police said that the remains would be subject to “advanced forensic testing and analysis”.The case received national attention at the time due to its grisly nature. Parts of the body were found one by one. A group of fishers who found the torsotold local pressthey initially thought it was a bag of drowned cats.Other parts foundincluded the woman’s head, thighs and arms. Investigators determined that she had been killed by blunt force trauma to the head.“For decades, the case was presumed impossible to resolve, and now, after nearly 80 years, we are hopeful we can restore this victim’s name and return her identity to history,” said Hailey Collord-Stalder, state forensic anthropologist.Explore more on these topicsOregonUS crimeUS policingWest CoastShareReuse this content"

Though charged with no crime, the 25-year-old was subjected to a cheek swab to collect their DNA, which was sent to the FBI, according to a new report. The unnamed citizen was later admitted into the country. Their DNA was added to the FBI’s database of genetic material despite the lack of criminal charges.The 25-year-old is one of about 2,000 US citizens whose DNA was collected between 2020 and 2024 by the Department of Homeland Security and shared with the FBI, researchers fromGeorgetown’s Center on Privacy and Technologyfound in an analysis of recently released data from US Customs and Border Protection (CBP). CBP officers took genetic material from some citizens as young as 14, according to the report.“In a flagrant and alarming abuse of power, the DHS has been regularly collecting DNA from US citizens without legal justification,” said Stevie Glaberson, the director of research and advocacy at Georgetown’s privacy center. “The lack of checks on DHS’s collection power we think renders the program unconstitutional and violates the fourth amendment.”Immigrant rights activists braced for crackdown as Trump threatens to target ‘leftwing’ groupsRead moreOnce immigration authorities collect DNA and share it with the FBI, it is stored in a database called the Combined DNA Index System (Codis), which is used across the country by local, state and federal law enforcement to identify suspects of crimes using their DNA. A May 2024report, also from Georgetown’s Center on Privacy and Technology, found that CBP had been collecting the DNA information of every migrant detained. Border patrol was also collecting and sharing the DNA information of migrant children, according to the agency’s data. Initial estimatesshowthat the sensitive genetic information of about 133,000 teens and children was being uploaded and stored in this federal criminal database in perpetuity.The new CBP documents specifically cover how many US citizens have had their genetic information collected at various ports of entry, including major airports. The agency compiled the data and included the ages of the people whose DNA samples were collected by border agents as well as what charges were being levied against them. Like the 25-year-old, about 40 US citizens had DNA samples taken by CBP and shared with the FBI even though they were charged with no crime. Six of these were minors.Under current regulation, CBP is permitted to collect the DNA of any individual – regardless of citizenship status – who has been arrested, is facing charges or has been convicted of a crime, as well as non-US citizens who have been detained.What the law does not allow border patrol agents to do, Glaberson asserts, is collect the DNA samples of US citizens simply because they have been detained. But the recently released data shows that CBP does not have a system to check whether there is a lawful reason to collect an individual’s DNA, she said.In some unusual cases, US citizens had their DNA swabbed for civil – not criminal – infractions such as “failure to declare” – which could be as simple as a person not declaring an item they bought abroad. In at least two cases of citizens having their DNA swabbed, the CBP agent simply wrote down “inspection by immigration officer” under charges.“This is CBP’s own administrative data,” Glaberson said. “This is what they’re writing down. What that data shows is pretty chilling. In case after case, CBP agents are pulling US citizens aside and swabbing their mouths without any reason to do so.”In about 865 of the nearly 2,000 cases of US citizens having their DNA swabbed by the CBP, no formal federal charges were filed. That means the cases never went before an independent arbiter such as a judge, according to Glaberson.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The Kremlin’s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, accused Frederiksen of making “unfounded accusations”.Danish police said two or three large drones that were seen on Monday night close to the airport, which is also the main airport for southern Sweden, appeared to have been flown by a “capable operator” who was looking to show that they had particular capabilities. No suspects have so far been identified.The drones inDenmarkcame from multiple directions, police said, turning their lights on and off for several hours before disappearing.Oslo airport, Norway’s main aviation hub, was also forced to close for three hours after two drones were observed there.Tens of thousands of passengers were stranded in the Nordic region by the two incidents and flights had to be diverted. Authorities in Denmark and Norway are investigating whether the two sightings were related.The Norwegian prime minister, Jonas Gahr Støre, accused Russia of violating Norwegian airspace three times in recent months.View image in fullscreenMette Frederiksen said the incident had to be seen ‘in the context of everything else that is happening in Europe’.Photograph: Emil Nicolai Helms/EPAFrederiksen said in a statement it was a reflection of “the times we live in and what we as a society must be able to handle”.“The police assess that this is a capable actor and the Copenhagen police are working closely with PET [the Danish security and intelligence agency], the Danish armed forces and international partners on the investigation, which is in full swing,” she said.“We are obviously not ruling out any options in relation to who is behind it. And it is clear that this fits in with the developments we have been able to observe recently with other drone attacks, violations of airspace and hacker attacks on European airports.”She said in an interview it had to be seen “in the context of everything else that is happening in Europe”.“We have seendrones over Polandthat should not have been there, we have seenactivity in Romania,violations of Estonian airspace, we have a hacker attackon European airportsover the weekend and now drones in Denmark and Norway,” she told the Danish broadcaster DR on Tuesday morning.“Therefore, I can only say that this is in my eyes a serious attack on Danish critical infrastructure.”She said the incursion was intended to “disrupt and create unrest. To create concern. See how far you can go and test the limits.”She added: “I cannot in any way deny that it is Russia. We are seeing a number of hybrid attacks and sabotage and attempted sabotage. What exactly has taken place in Denmark, the authorities are now investigating.”Her Norwegian counterpart, Gahr Støre, said in a statement: “Russia has violated Norwegian airspace on three occasions this spring and summer.“We cannot determine whether this was done intentionally or due to navigation errors. Regardless of the cause, this is not acceptable.”He described the three Norwegian incidents this year as “smaller in scope” than those in Estonia, Poland and Romania, but they came after more than 10 years with no such incidents.

Gahr Støre said the border violations lasted between one and four minutes. According to the Norwegian government, the first incident, on 25 April, involved a Russian SU-24 fighter jet; the second, on 24 July, involved a Russian L410 Turbolet aircraft; and the third, on 18 August, involved a Russian SU-33 fighter jet.Separately, on Monday night, a couple from Singapore, tourists in their 50s and 60s, were reportedly arrested for flying a drone in central Oslo. The drone is being examined by authorities and there is no suspicion that it is related to the drone sightings at Oslo or Copenhagen airports.Jens Jespersen, a Danish police chief superintendent, said of the airport drone incident: “We have concluded that this was what we would call a capable operator. It’s an actor who has the capabilities, the will and the tools to show off in this way.”The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, claimed Russia was behind the Copenhagen incident. Danish police declined to comment on the claim.Among the theories being investigated by police is that the drones may have been launched from ships. Copenhagen airport is a short distance from the Baltic and one of the world’s busiest shipping lanes where hundreds of Russian “shadow fleet” ships are understood to be passing through, carrying crude oil on which sanctions have been imposed.Jacob Kaarsbo, a former chief analyst at the Danish defence intelligence agency, said launch from one of those vessels in the Baltic was “the most likely option”. The drones, he said, were fixed-wing drones, about 2.5 metres (8ft) wide, which would have required a special launch mechanism, meaning that it was most likely the work of a state actor.“We have seen Russia launch drones from shadow fleet ships before,” Kaarsbo said, citing a recent incident in German waters. “We have seen this modus operandi before where they use shadow fleet ships to launch drones, to do reconnaissance, or in this case to disturb public order.”Although larger models are generally able to travel longer distances, Kaarsbo said it was still unlikely a drone would have made it from the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad to Copenhagen airport without detection.Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, said she had spoken to Frederiksen about the Copenhagen incident, writing on social media: “While the facts are still being established, it is clear that we are witnessing a pattern of ongoing challenges at our borders.”Mark Rutte, Nato’s secretary general, said it was too early to say whether the incident in Denmark was connected to Russian violations of airspace elsewhere in Europe.There have been a number of disruptions at European airports in recent days. On Friday, a cyber-attack on check-in and boarding systems led to problems at London Heathrow, Berlin and Brussels.Explore more on these topicsDenmarkAir transportDrones (non-military)NorwayEuropeRussianewsShareReuse this content"

The report, from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, notes that widespread take-up of these practices is required if bird numbers are to recover.Prof Richard Gregory, RSPB’s head of monitoring conservation science, said: “Alarmingly, the new data show an accelerating pattern of decline in our bird populations, whether on our farmland, wetlands, uplands or seas, as they are pushed past their limits. Notably, seabirds have crashed in number, many hit hard by avian influenza, on top of a cocktail of growing pressures.Time is running out to meet government targets to recover nature and yet we have the solutions and knowhow, now we need all the different actors to pull together to bring UK birds back from the brink.”Swifts’ decline: how can Britons help these remarkable birds?Read moreFarmland bird populations have fallen by about 62% over the long term and 11% in the short term, with harsher declines for farmland specialist birds than generalists. Those which have faced the worst declines include turtle dove, grey partridge and the tree sparrow.However, there is also some good news in the data, which shows that woodland bird populations are beginning to stabilise as more habitat is restored across the UK. Last year’s data found that woodland species had the highest number of species declining in the short term. This year, fewer woodland species are declining and more are increasing, although the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) says it continues to be concerned about the green woodpecker, which is strongly declining in the short term (by 22% since 2018).Species such as lapwing and yellowhammer are showing concerning declines, with numbers plummeting by more than 65% over the longer period and continuing to strongly decline in the most recent five years across both England and the UK.The government has a target to halt the decline of nature by 2030 and increase species abundance and biodiversity in the following years. This includes wild bird numbers.Alice Groom, RSPB’s head of sustainable land use policy, said: “New data shows once again concerning declines in farmland birds. What we’ve seen for the past 50 years – that yellowhammers, turtle doves, lapwing, and other farmland birds are in a dramatic freefall.“Yet we also know that farmers working with nature can reverse these declines while also improving long-term food production. We need the UK government to roll out a set of effective and well-funded, nature-friendly schemes at scale enabling farmers to manage 10% for nature, providing the year-round resources for farmland birds to rebound. This includes ensuring farmers already in schemes can continue to access funding.”A Defra spokesperson said: “We are a proud nation of nature lovers, but our natural world is under threat, with one in six species in Great Britain at risk of national extinction, including some of our most cherished birds. Through record investment in nature-friendly farming, we are putting the foundations in place to reverse this trend and ensure the recovery of our bird populations”.Explore more on these topicsBirdsEndangered speciesnewsShareReuse this content"

Photograph:ConservationInternational“I just became enchanted with all of that,” she says. Today, Briche González is part of the grassroots organisationProceso de Comunidades Negras(PCN), which advocates for the rights and recognition of Afro-descendant peoples in southern Colombia.Afro-descendant communities in Latin America have long cultivated “edible landscapes”, which grow in the midst of natural forests and mimic the surrounding flora. Across the region,Afro-descendant peoples manage about 200m hectares(2m sq km or 494m acres) of these agroforestry systems in biodiversity hotspots, of which only 5% are legally recognised as collectively titled territories.For decades, those communities have argued that they play a critical role in protecting biodiversity and therefore need legal protection over their lands. Until recently, there was little scientific data to support their claims.View image in fullscreenA view of the landscape off Colombia’s Pacific coast, where biodiversity is thriving. Photograph: Daniel Uribe/Conservation InternationalNew research changes that. A paperpublished recentlyin Nature Communications Earth & Environment is the first peer-reviewed study quantifying the role of Afro-descendant peoples’ contributions to biodiversity, carbon sequestration and the reduction of deforestation, says Martha Cecilia Rosero-Peña, a co-author and environmental sociologist.Researchers analysed formally recognised Afro-descendant lands in Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador and Suriname, covering about 9.9m hectares. They found that more thanhalf of this land (56%) overlaps with the highest 5% of biodiverse areason Earth. In Ecuador, the figure is striking: 99% of all Afro-descendant land is in biodiversity hotspots, while in Colombia almost 92% of Afro-descendant lands are in the top 5% of areas for biodiversity.The study also found that deforestation rates in Afro-descendant lands were 29% lower than in protected areas, and 55% lower than land on the edge of a protected area.These forests have co-evolved with the communities that inhabit themJohana Herrera Arango, Javeriana UniversityKlaudia Cárdenas Botero, an environmental anthropologist at the Humboldt Institute in Colombia, who was not involved in the study, says: “This means that practices historically classified as ‘subsistence’ are, in fact, conservation strategies that are as effective – or even more effective – than many state policies for protected areas.”To understand why Afro-descendant communities have preserved the forest so well, Rosero-Peña dug into scientific records dating back to the 1500s. What she found was a hidden side-effect of the European plantation model in theAmericas.“Science always focuses on the history of plantations and enslaved people,” Rosero-Peña says. “But it rarely tells us what they ate.”Unlike the Europeans, who did not know how to grow food in the tropics, most of the Africans were taken from one tropical region to another. They were in charge of food production on the plantations, and adapted farming systems from Africa, blending local and African plants such as yams, okra, pigeon peas, plantains and millet, Rosero-Peña says.View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenView image in fullscreen‘Edible landscapes’ grow among the forests and mimic the surrounding flora.

Photographs: José Hernández/Humboldt Institute; Conservation InternationalAgricultural knowledge was also a lifeline to freedom: hidden crops would grow along the escape routes enslaved Africans traversed many times,carrying rice seeds hidden in their braids. Escapers had to imitate the forest to stay hidden, which meant planting diverse crops, minimising land clearing, and avoiding fire. West African women adapted rice farming to drought-prone regions by timing it with river tides.“These forests – and this paper shows it clearly – have co-evolved with the communities that inhabit them,” says Johana Herrera Arango, director of the Observatory of Ethnic and Peasant Territories at Bogotá’s Javeriana University, who was not involved in the study. “Biological diversity is also a human creation.”Once slavery ended, many Afro-descendant communities turned to agriculture and some became powerful cacao producers. Unlike plantations, these farms thrived as edible forests.When Briche González was a child, echoes of the cacao boom remained. The farm’s cacao and coffee beans allowed her grandmother to raise nine children and their offspring. And though many Afro-descendant families lost most of their land during forced land reforms in the 1940s, it was theexpansion of sugar plantations in the 1960s and 1970sthat caused the biggest declines, Briche González says.View image in fullscreenA small Afro-descendant settlement by a river in Ecuador.View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenFishing and catching clams among the mangroves. Photographs: Conservation InternationalHarsh pesticides drifted into ancestral farms, reducing productivity. Many families sold or rented their lands to plantation owners. “When my grandmother died, the sugar mills leased our land,” Briche González says. “Now, the house is completely walled in sugarcane.”Magic mushrooms: how scientists discovered fungi are the secret ingredient for restoring the world’s forestsRead moreOnly a handful of ancestral farms now remain among 250,000 hectares of sugarcane plantations. But amid them,researchers have foundat least 128 plant species still grow in the remaining array of trees, bushes, herbs and animals. Cárdenas Botero, from the Humboldt Institute,found a similarly astonishing number of speciesin black communities’ farms in northern Colombia: 272 species of plants and 151 insect species.Efforts to keep that legacy alive are under way. Briche González, who is an ecology technician, helped design a university diploma programme in agro-ecology for those tending family farms. The PCN is pressing Colombia’s culture ministry to recognise their farms as part of the national heritage. Other groups are piloting an“Afro-food corridor”spanning 1,640 hectares.Food forests, Briche González says, “are everything.

Suddenly, a juvenile humpback whale, known as NYC0318 in local records, bursts through the surface of the water, engulfing thousands of small, oily fish.For those onboard the 29-metre (95ft) vessel, the scene is a thrill to watch, in part because it is taking place not far out at sea but just off the coast of Manhattan,New York. Among the tourists watching is Chris St Lawrence, a naturalist and the communications director of Gotham Whale, a volunteer-run marine research organisation in the city. He is not just looking out for the whales, he is watching for danger around them.“When they’re feeding, they can get really distracted, and they don’t care about boats,” he says.View image in fullscreenChris St Lawrence of Gotham Whale, which tracks whales and other marine mammals off New York and New Jersey.Photograph: Lauren Owens LambertWhen Gotham Whale began tracking humpbacks in 2012, its NYC humpback catalogue contained just five individuals. Today, it includes 470 whales – mostly transient juveniles such as NYC0318 drawn by the rich feeding opportunities of the New York Bight. But with the hunt for such bounty comes a growing problem.What was once a marine highway connecting southern breeding grounds to northern feeding areas has, since 2010, become a regular foraging destination, putting humpbacks on a collision course with maritime traffic.Cargo vessels, tankers, cruise ships, fishing boats and recreational craft all cross humpback feeding grounds in the New York Bight – an area roughly the size of Switzerland, stretching from southern New Jersey to eastern Long Island and offshore to the Hudson Canyon, a deep submarine valley.Danielle Brown, research director at Gotham Whale, says: “I don’t think people realise they are out there, and these shipping companies certainly don’t expect to see them.”Lesley Thorne, a marine scientist at Stony Brook University on Long Island, says several factors are converging dangerously: recovering humpback populations, potential climate-related shifts in their food, and whales venturing into shipping corridors to feed. “It is this perfect storm of events,” she says.Since the end of commercial whaling, humpbacks have become a conservation success story. In 2016, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa) delisted the whales in New York waters (considered as part of the West Indies population) under the Endangered Species Act.But that same year, large whale strandings along the US east coast began to rise, prompting Noaa todeclare an Unusual Mortality Eventin 2017 that remains open today.View image in fullscreenWhere whales once just passed through the waters off New York, they are increasingly venturing into the busy shipping lanes to feed.Photograph: Chris St Lawrence/gothamwhale.orgThorne’s2024 researchfound vessel strikes to be the main cause, although fishing gear entanglements played a part.The New York Bight hosts an extraordinary array of endangered whales: blue, fin, sei, sperm and North Atlantic right whales. In 2024, researchers documented critically endangered North Atlantic right whales near Hudson Canyon, close to busy shipping lanes.In May that year, a cruise ship arrived at a New York port with a dead endangered sei whaledraped on its bow. The common draw is food, but humpback feeding behaviour compounds the risk.The combination of surface feeding and shallow waters likely makes them more vulnerable to vessel strikesLesley Thorne, Stony Brook University“We see surface aggregations of menhaden [herring-like fish] that are really close to shore, and we have almost exclusively juvenile whales feeding in these really nearshore waters, as shallow as 15ft [5 metres] of water,” says Thorne. “The combination of surface feeding and shallow waters likely makes them more vulnerable to vessel strikes.”Gotham Whale’s research documents the toll, showing whales with vessel strike scars and deep propeller wounds. One case this year involved a healthy humpback observed one day bearing fresh strike injuries only days later in the same area.As one of the world’s fastest-warming ocean regions, changing conditions may be drawing more whales closer to shore to feed.View image in fullscreenThe endangered sei whale that was found dead on the bow of a cruise ship arriving in New York last year.Photograph: Atlantic Marine Conservation SocietyJanet Coit, who was Noaa’s assistant administrator for fisheries under the Biden administration, says: “The scientists out of our Northeast Fisheries Science Center were clear that warming waters are affecting the productivity of the ocean and bringing more whales in closer to shore, which is causing greater interactions with vessels and more vessel strikes.”The remedy – to reroute vessels or slow them down – is clear but not easily achieved. “With three shipping lanes into New York, there is no opportunity to reroute vessels,” says Samantha Rosen, a spokesperson for the New York State environmental conservation department.Cruise ship arrives at New York City harbor with dead whale caught on bowRead moreStudies show that reducing ship speeds to 10 knots (12mph) decreases strike likelihood and lethality. Currently, vessels 20 metres or longer must travel no faster than 10 knots from January to May in seasonal management areas, including around major ports. However, in January 2025, the Noaa withdrew proposed vessel speed rule expansions that would have better protected large whales year-round by expanding protections to larger areas, longer time periods and smaller vessels.The revisions, aimed at reducing risks to right whales, would also have helped other large whales, says Thorne. But resistance from mariners and lawmakers has hindered Noaa’s proposal, says Coit. Meanwhile, voluntary slowdowns triggered when whales are detected have limited effectiveness.The regulatory setback coincides withsignificant cutsto Noaa’s funding, staffing and climate research programmes since January.When the US enacted wildlife protection laws in the 1970s, Coit says there was a moral ethic around saving whales and conservation. “I’m concerned that this ethic is not underpinning our values any more,” she says.“If people want to save the whales, they are going to have to change their behaviour.”The reporting for this story was supported by the Pulitzer Center’s Ocean Reporting NetworkExplore more on these topicsGlobal developmentSeascape: the state of our oceansWhalesCetaceansMarine lifeWildlifeNew YorkEndangered speciesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

While more than $1tn of the total is still likely to flow into fossil fuels, double that amount – about $2.2tn – is expected for low-carbon forms of energy.Areport from the Zero Carbon Analytics thinktank, published on Tuesday, shows that the rate of increase in renewable energy investment has not slowed significantly. Between the first half of 2023 and of 2024, the total increased by 12% and from 2022 to 2023 the increase was 17%.Joanne Bentley-McKune, research analyst at the group, said: “This shows the sector still has momentum and underlying strength. There has been a decline [in the rate of growth] but it aligns with the average [of the last three years], and suggests that renewable energy investment is more resilient than might have been expected.”Finance for onshore and offshore wind increased by about a quarter in this first half of this year, reaching £126bn. China and Europe were the biggest markets for offshore wind.Since January this year, at least $470bn in future clean energy finance has been announced, according to the report, of which roughly three-quarters is slated for energy grids and electricity transmission. This is good news for governments hoping to reach their commitments to cut greenhouse gas emissions, asageing and inadequate grids have been a major bottleneckfor the achievement of renewable energy goals.A separate report, also published on Tuesday, found that big companies are also continuing to press ahead with their climate promises, despite hostility from Donald Trump’s administration in the US, and some high-profile moves to row back on commitments.According todata compiled by the Net Zero Tracker, a research consortium made up of thinktanks and academics, companies representing about 70% of the revenue of the top 2,000 listed companies globally were actively pursuing net zero plans.While Trump has pulled the US out of the Paris climate agreement, anddismantled federal efforts to tackle the climate crisis, not all of the US has followed the federal government’s lead: 19 states remain committed to net zero, and 304 large companies headquartered in the US have net zero targets, up from 279 last year. Together, those companies account for nearly two-thirds of US corporate revenue, or about $12tn in revenue globally.John Lang, lead author of the report, said the impact of the White House on climate decisions made by large companies appeared limited. “Talk of a net zero recession is overblown. Backtracking is confined to fossil fuels andtheir financiers, while more companies are moving from box-ticking to real emission cuts – a long-overdue reset,” he said.But countries and companies still need to move faster, the report found. Although more are now putting measures in place to matchtheir commitments, there is still a large gap between aspiration and action.Thomas Hale, professor of global public policy at the Blavatnik School of Government at Oxford University, said: “US companies know they need to keep pace with the EU,China and other regions where climate policy is increasingly shaping competitiveness. Net zero is less a political battleground and more a race to secure future markets, investment and jobs.”Explore more on these topicsRenewable energyEnergy (Environment)US politicsDonald TrumpFossil fuelsEnergy (Technology)newsShareReuse this content"

He accused one witness of making up multiple rape allegations and another of falsifying the date on a Snapchat screenshot, “all of which were untrue and baseless”, said Steyn.The judge also said that Clarke had made “wholly unfounded allegations of dishonesty against three professional journalists”: the Guardian’s head of investigations, Paul Lewis, and the authors of the investigation, Sirin Kale and Lucy Osborne.Steyn said the total legal costs incurred by the Guardian had been increased by the conduct of Clarke and his legal team. Steyn said that was “something the claimant has to bear responsibility for”.In written submissions, Gavin Millar KC, for Guardian News & Media, said “Clarke’s unreasonable conduct” included introducing unfounded allegations of a conspiracy against him. This had “inevitably massively increased the scale and costs of the litigation by giving rise to a whole new un-pleaded line of attack against witnesses and third parties”.The court heard that usually an interim payment would be 75% to 80% of the total amount the losing party in the case was likely to end up paying.Steyn said: “It seems to me that the sum of £3m sought by the defendant is appropriate and no more than what ought to be reasonably ordered in this case.“It is substantially lower than the defendant’s likely level of recovery on detailed assessment and so in my judgment, it does allow for a suitably wide margin of error.”She gave Clarke 28 days to make the payment.The Noel Clarke judgment is a victory for the brave women who told us their stories – and for journalism | Katharine VinerRead moreThe writer and producer of the Kidulthood trilogy had argued that the costs order should be stayed pending his decision on whether to appeal. But Steyn said that Clarke had already been granted an extension on the usual time limit for applying for permission to appeal to Tuesday’s hearing and it would not be appropriate to extend it further.The actor represented himself at court. He said in written submissions that his legal team, who “largely acted on a no-win, no-fee basis, resigned when I could not provide funds for this hearing”.Clarke said he had used his life savings to fight the case, had remortgaged the family home and had had little or no income for over four-and-a-half years, arguing that the judge should take that into account when making the interim costs order.But Steyn told him that a party’s ability to pay becomes relevant only at the enforcement stage, not when determining the appropriate amount.Explore more on these topicsNoel ClarkeThe GuardianNewspapersNewspapers & magazinesNational newspapersShareReuse this content"

At Reading crown court on Tuesday, a judge sentenced him to 12 months in jail after he admitted a single charge of breaching a restraining order. He was also handed a fresh restraining order not to contact Tweedy.Bannister arrived at her home by taxi for the fourth time on 19 June just before 10pm and rang the intercom system twice before peering over the gate, the court heard.Bannister claimed the singer had invited him to her home over Microsoft Teams, the court was told. In a victim impact statement, the singer said she was “stunned” when Bannister visited her home yet again, and that she had been forced to hire personal security.“Each time he returns the worry of his intentions intensifies,” she said. “I’m worried, nervous and on edge every time I open my gate.

The changes also make clear that events should always take place outside working hours, unless they directly benefit the organisation, such as learning and development – and in these instances, signoff from the line manager of attenders will be required for them to go to the event.It warned that, under the guidance, network activity may be suspended or ceased if networks do not comply with the new rules.However, the government was cautioned that its decision to brief the new rules to the Telegraph – including a Labour source saying it would stop “nonsense” events – risked the civil service once again feeling under attack.One civil service union source said: “Work to mend the relationship between civil servants and ministers, which deteriorated so badly under the last government, is undone when policy developments are briefed exclusively to media which have a long history of attacking the civil service.“It risks staff feeling under attack at a time when once again they are being asked to do more with less.”Others also warned the government that it must not lead to a lessening of its commitment to equality, diversity and inclusion (EDI). Some of the biggest civil service staff networks are the Race Forum and the LGBT+ network.Steve Thomas, the deputy general secretary of the Prospect union, said: “Formalising new rules around staff networks is a sensible step and will add clarity around the civil service code.“It is important, however, that this does not represent a weakening of the government’s commitment to the importance of EDI and we will be working with the Cabinet Office to ensure this does not happen.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It will ensure all network members and leaders are aware of the need to remain impartial at all times and fulfil the expected behaviours set out in the civil service code.”Alex Thomas, a programme director at the Institute for Government, said the new rules were “reasonably proportionate as most meetings take place after work or in lunchtimes anyway”, and “reminding civil servants that they are primarily there to do their core jobs is not a bad thing and clearly civil service networks shouldn’t be campaigning or agitating against government policy”.However, he said staff networks were valuable for many different groups within the civil service and there had been some undue criticism of legitimate networks.Explore more on these topicsCivil serviceNick Thomas-SymondsTrade unionsnewsShareReuse this content"

The series broadcast its launch show on Saturday.Dyer-Bowen, who was paired with the professional dancer Nikita Kuzmin, told her Instagram followers she will take a “few days off my socials” to process her departure and will return to the set to cheer on the remaining cast.Holding back tears, she said in the video on Tuesday evening: “Hi guys, I’m going to do this, and try and do this without crying, but yeah, I’m so heartbroken, like I’ve not felt like this in such a long time.“I was having the best time ever … It’s just [a] very, very annoying, devastating thing that I’m kind of going through right now, but I’m probably just going to have a few days off my socials just to, you know, process things.”She said everyone at Strictly “is absolutely amazing” and “I’m going to miss them all so much,” adding: “I will eventually obviously come along and cheer them all on.”In a statement shared earlier on Tuesday, she said: “I had a fall on Friday in rehearsals and landed funny. I thought I had rolled my foot but it swelled up badly over the weekend and after an MRI scan yesterday, it turns out I have fractured my ankle.”After the news was announced on the show’s Instagram account, the head judge, Shirley Ballas, replied: “I’m so so sorry. But health is most important. Get well soon Angel.”The TV star’s father, the actor Danny Dyer, posted a broken heart emoji.Dyer-Bowen is the second celebrity to withdraw from the show this series. The Game of Thrones actor and DJ Kristian Nairn pulled out from the series for medical reasons last month. The Emmerdale actor Lewis Cope was drafted in to replace Nairn.Explore more on these topicsStrictly Come DancingBBCReality TVEntertainment TVTelevisionnewsShareReuse this content"

Her son had left their home several minutes earlier to get something to eat.‘The ground shook’: drone attacks help Haitian government wrest control of capital from criminal gangsRead moreShe found him on the ground, his leg and arm blown off.“Come get me, come get me, please mama,” she said he told her, but he had lost too much blood. “By the time we got to the hospital, he died.”Haiti’s National Human Rights Defense Network accused police of launching two exploding drones in the Simon Pelé community of Cité Soleil as suspected gang leader Albert Stevenson, known as Djouma, prepared to celebrate his birthday.The group said that Stevenson was distributing gifts to children when the attack occurred.Romain Le Cour, head of Haiti Observatory at the Global Initiative Against Transnational Organized Crime, said the attack raises “urgent questions of accountability”.“It has now been 48 hours since the incident, and the authorities have yet to issue any official communication or assume public responsibility. Who, ultimately, will assume responsibility for this attack: the prime minister? The transitional presidential council? Private security companies? The leadership of Haiti national police?” he asked.Le Cour said the attacks would only reinforce the gang coalition’s anti-government narrative at a critical juncture.“They are also likely to deepen public mistrust in state institutions and accelerate the erosion of governmental legitimacy,” he said.A spokesperson for Haiti’s national police did not immediately return a message seeking comment.Also killed in Saturday’s attack were three adult civilians and four suspected gang members, with seven other gunmen injured, according to the human rights group.Among the civilians killed was 33-year-old St-Jean Limonthard, whose mother often worried about him working as a moto taxi driver in a capital that is 90% controlled by gangs.“I prayed for him every day that he went out, and now he died in his own neighborhood coming back from work,” said his mother Aglamoïde Saint-Ville, 53, as she held her son’s six-year-old daughter in her lap.Saint-Ville said her son was the head of the family.“The child won’t be able to go to school,” she said. “I don’t know how we’re going to eat since we had no savings.”Activists noted that a similar operation involving explosive drones in downtownPort-au-Princekilled at least 11 civilians earlier this month.The human rights group said several gang members have been killed in drone attacks since March.A spokesperson for the office of Alix Didier Fils-Aimé, the prime minister, could not be immediately reached for comment.A new task force created earlier this year has operated outside the oversight of Haiti’s national police and employed the use of explosive drones.The attack comes as Vectus Global, the security firm of former US navy Seal Erik Prince, expects to deploy nearly 200 personnel from various countries to Haiti as part of a one-year deal to quell gang violence there.Explore more on these topicsHaitiPort-au-PrincenewsShareReuse this content"

Because the money thing, I forgot.”Protests against Disney’s suspension of Kimmel and canceled subscriptions to Disney products mounted as concern over free speech rights grew. High-profile peoplejoinedin the calls to boycott. Democratic New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani said he wouldn’t do a town hall on a local ABC channel,reversing courseafter Kimmel’s reinstatement.Some Republicans, including Ted Cruz and Rand Paul, also spoke out against the Federal Communications Commission’s chair pressuring Disney.“Here’s why Disney folded after Kimmel was suspended: Google searches for cancel Disney+ and cancel Hulu spiked,” Colbert said, “which explains why the other trending search was ‘how to entertain my child without Bluey’. So Disney put Kimmel back on because you, the American people, were upset.”Comedian Jon Stewart credited the boycott campaign of “pretending that you were going to cancel Hulu while secretly racing through four seasons of Only Murders in the Building”on his showon Monday night.“Wasn’t it interesting to try and figure out all the tentacles Disney has in your daily life?” Stewart quipped. “It’s one thing to swear off cruises, but the Avengers. How is it possible that by getting rid of one company, I can’t watch Winnie the Pooh or Monday Night Football or listen to early Hillary Duff?”Seth Meyerspointedto the “massive national backlash to Trump’s crackdown on free speech, even among conservatives”.“I haven’t seen a poll yet, but I think if you asked Americans if the president should be dictating what TV hosts can and can’t say, you’d get about 3% positive,” he said before playing a clip of Trump claiming that the coverage he receives is “97% negative”.Disney said it would bring Kimmel back on Tuesday, saying it had “spent the last days having thoughtful conversations with Jimmy, and after those conversations, we reached the decision to return the show on Tuesday”.In explaining its decision to take the show off the air, the company said it wanted to “avoid further inflaming a tense situation at an emotional moment for our country” and that some of Kimmel’s comments were “ill-timed and thus insensitive”.The suspension came after the FCC chair, Brendan Carr, threatened that the agency could come after outlets that aired Kimmel’s show after comments Kimmel made about Charlie Kirk’s shooter. Kimmel had said that the “Maga gang” was “desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them and with everything they can to score political points from it”. The comments came before charging documents alleged the shooter had left-leaning viewpoints.“But frankly, when you see stuff like this, I mean, look, we can do this the easy way or the hard way,” Carr said on a podcast. “These companies can find ways to change conduct and take action, frankly, on Kimmel or, you know, there’s going to be additional work for the FCC ahead.”Companies that hold the licenses for local channels that carry Kimmel’s show said they would pre-empt it, not airing it on the stations they own. Then, Disney said it would suspend Kimmel’s show indefinitely.However, not all stations in the US will broadcast Kimmel’s return.Sinclair Broadcast Group said it would not air the show on its ABC affiliate stations.“Beginning Tuesday night, Sinclair will be pre-emptingJimmy KimmelLive! across our ABC affiliate stations and replacing it with news programming,” said Sinclair, which has the nation’s largest number of the network’s affiliate stations.“Discussions with ABC are ongoing as we evaluate the show’s potential return,” the group said in a statement late on Monday.Another broadcast group,Nexstar, also said that it would continue to pre-empt the show.In a statement, Nexstar said: “We made a decision last week to pre-empt Jimmy Kimmel Live! following what ABC referred to as Mr Kimmel’s ‘ill-timed and insensitive’ comments at a critical time in our national discourse. We stand by that decision pending assurance that all parties are committed to fostering an environment of respectful, constructive dialogue in the markets we serve.”The actions of Nexstar and Sinclair combined mean that Kimmel’s show won’t air on almost a quarter ofABC’s affiliates.Explore more on these topicsJimmy KimmelWalt Disney CompanyUS politicsStephen ColbertJon StewartTelevisionTelevision industrynewsShareReuse this content"

Eyewitnesses say the police shouted “stop” twice before shooting towards the teens.Resident Johnny Inthisone told CBC News that the shooting unfolded only seconds after police warned the youths to stop.Despite efforts by police and paramedics to revive Rezayi, he was pronounced dead at a hospital.Bishop said Rezayi was struck by at least one bullet and that investigators were conducting a forensic analysis of the gun collected at the scene.Rezayi’s family, who immigrated to Quebec from Afghanistan, say the death of their son has left them with grief and few answers.“I love my son. I love my baby,” his mother, Fahima, told the Montreal Gazette. “Why did they shoot my baby?”Rezayi said the family has received almost no information since he was killed. “Nothing. They’re not giving me anything,” she said.The teen’s father, Sharif, said police didn’t come to the family home until nearly six hours after the shooting. “We sat here, not knowing. And then they came and told us he was gone,” he said.During the Tuesday press conference, Bishop said investigators retrieved a baseball bat and ski masks at the scene but declined to provide further specifics about the case, citing the ongoing investigation. She said five people had been assigned to the case.But she warned residents against pursing “private investigations” into the shooting.“A lot of people that are trying to understand what’s going on. I totally understand that, but they’re doing certain private investigations and they’re meeting with people,” she said, calling on anyone with evidence to come forward. “You have to trust us. We’re the ones who are doing the investigation. We’re an independent office. Our mission is to shed light on what happened and that’s what we’re going to do.”Explore more on these topicsCanadaAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

Asked for comment by the Guardian, Errol Musk provided a list of answers to queries from the Times, including replies that read “this is nonsense” and “this is absolute rubbish”.Citing personal letters, emails and interviews with family members, the Times said that Errol Musk, who has at least nine children and stepchildren and has been married to three women, “maintains a powerful grip over much of the family”.The Times saidElon Muskdid not respond to the publication’s requests for comment.Judging from court records, personal correspondence, social workers and interviews with family members, the Times said the earliest accusation against Errol Musk was in 1993, when his four-year-old stepdaughter told relatives he had touched her at the family house.A decade later, the stepdaughter said she caught him sniffing her dirty underwear, the Times reported, adding that some family members have also accused him of abusing two of his daughters and a stepson.The making of Elon Musk: how did his childhood in apartheid South Africa shape him?Read moreThree separate law enforcement investigations were opened, the outlet said, citing police and court records, as well as family members’ accounts. Two of the inquiries ended without action, while it is unclear what happened in the third investigation.“There was no evidence because this is nonsense,” Errol Musk said in a statement to the Times, saying “the reports are false”. He accused family members who were “putting the children up to say false things” and that they were trying to extort Elon, his eldest son.Elon Musk has described a difficult relationship with Errol on the rare occasion when he has commented on his father. He told Rolling Stone in 2017 that his father had done “almost every evil thing you could possibly think of”.In the profile,Musk said he had gone to live with his father at age 10 while his younger siblings, Kimbal and Tosca, stayed with their mother.“I felt sorry for my father, because my mother had all three kids. He seemed very sad and lonely by himself. So I thought, ‘I can be company,’” he said.He continued: “I didn’t really understand at the time what kind of person he was … It was not a good idea.”Without going into specifics, he told the publication: “My dad will have a carefully thought-out plan of evil. He will plan evil.”Explore more on these topicsUS newsElon MuskNew York TimesChildrenRape and sexual assaultnewsShareReuse this content"

Based at London’s Southbank Centre, it invites the public to submit poems in threatened languages, collating them for future generations.Winston acknowledges the “sense of urgency and loss” –every two weeks, another language falls silentand by the end of this century, half of the world’s 7,000 tongues are expected to become extinct. But he was determined for this to be much more than a mournful symposium: “It is a festival and you want to have that playful and joyful element.”View image in fullscreenStrong words … a Sam Winston flag from Seed Syllable.Photograph: PR IMAGEAfter an opening event featuring Trainspotting authorIrvine Welsh, there will be workshops including interactive sessions on the 94 languages spoken across the London borough of Hackney, and how to create your own alphabet. The live literature programme will showcase dialect poetry (from Scouse toSylheti) and invented languages (fromKlingontoPolari).Throughout next month, there will also be the free-to-access Creative Voice Exhibition – an immersive area where you can contribute to a collaborative artwork by drawing, writing or rhyming your response to your favourite piece of language – and a family-friendly listening trail in which you can discover hidden languages using a map that will take you to quiet corners of the Barbican’s brutalist complex. “You’ll walk to different stations and you can hear all of these different communities,” says Winston. “It’s not really about language, it’s about how people get married and how people go fishing.”Winston grew up in Devon, Wales and Yorkshire as a dyslexic boy “suspicious of all these tiny black marks … It felt like language was something that was quite authoritarian,” he says. It was only at Camberwell College of Art that he made a breakthrough, on a design course learning about typography and letter form.“That experience of not being able to communicate what’s important to me, even in the English language, made me very sympathetic to a situation whereHawad” – one of the five poets, a Tamajaght-speaking artist from the Aïr region of Niger – “cannot share his language and his culture in a way that is supported by anyone beyond this small community. That made me an ally. It’s really important that we create spaces, and say these voices are valid.”What I would like is that you turn up and learn a lot about yourselfAt the heart of the “audio treasure hunt” by sonic artistJamie Pererais a piece titled Babel Reclaimed, in which a cacophony of hundreds of voices come together in perfect harmony. It was made in collaboration with linguistMandana Seyfeddinipur, director of theEndangered Languages Archive(a Berlin-based digital repository for “unique records of local knowledge systems encoded in their languages”), and came from her rejection of the Tower of Babel parable, about humanity speaking in a unified tongue.Some still regard the prospect of a single universal language – such as the 19th-century attempt to get the world to speak Esperanto – as a utopian ideal. Not Winston. “If we only have one paintbrush to paint in, and only one colour to paint with, that, from an artistic perspective, is a disaster.”He has not yet properly engaged with the languages of his mother’s Irish and father’s East-End Jewish ancestors, but has explored Tibetan through his meditation practice and Hangul via his Korean partner.“Language is an expression of being human, and that’s at the core of the festival,” he says. “You can turn up and learn about a lot of diverse cultures. But really what I would like is that you turn up and you learn a lot about yourself: ‘What is my past? Why don’t I know Ogham or Old Irish? What is my relationship to Yiddish?’ That would make me very happy.”Voiced: The Festival for Endangered Languages is at the Barbican, London, 1 to 31 OctoberExplore more on these topicsCultureExhibitionsSouthbank CentreIrvine WelshPoetryLanguagefeaturesShareReuse this content"

They were almost doing a ‘prophylactic fascism’. They weren’t even waiting to be told to expel students and put down all protests … I guess you would have to go back to a McCarthy era to see this kind of obedience.”“All institutions are under attack,” she added. “I know of artists who have signed contracts to do commissions and these commissions have been either stalled or cancelled for anti-DEI reasons. So it’s really happening … I’m more than concerned, it’s getting a little scary.”The Royal Academy show will be the largest to date for Leigh, who is 57 but was in her 40s before the wider art world began to take note of her work, which was often in the form of ceramics that critics dismissed as a “material for hobbyists or studio potters”.She has had a meteoric rise over the past 15 years, becoming an artist whose work connected Black Lives Matter to older movements, while also chiming with the theory of African American public intellectuals such asChristina Sharpe.Leigh grew up in Chicago, attending an evangelical church where her father was the preacher, before going to college and eventually living in a yurt near Charlottesville, Virginia, with a group of would-be ceramicists.She said: “Because the show’s inLondon, it’s been making me hyper-focus what it means, my personal history, and what ties I have to London, which is really only through my parents, who were [born in Jamaica as] British subjects.”She often works with clay, sometimes casting models into other materials such as bronze. Her sculpture Brick House, made in 2019, sat on the High Line in New York, and waspart of The Milk of Dreams, the title of her Golden Lion-winning Venice Biennale show.The show’s curator, Tarini Malik, said: “In terms of representing the breadth of her career, there are only a few spaces that can hold her work in that way.”Leigh’s breakthrough moment came in 2012 with the You Don’t Know Where Her Mouth Has Been exhibition at The Kitchen in New York, which included Queen Bee (2008-2012), a “menacing chandelier conglomeration of black terracotta forms bristling with defunct TV antennas”.At Venice, Leigh hosted thesecond instalment of her Loophole of Retreatevent, where speakers, includingLorraine O’Grady, discussed everything fromblack feminist ideasto post-colonial theory, alongside performances. The first edition was held at theGuggenheim in New York, with queues forming at 8am.The third Loophole of Retreat will take place in London, with a UK curator who is yet to be named working alongside longtime collaboratorRashida Bumbray.The Turner Contemporary in Margate will show two of her sculptures – Bisi (2023) and Untitled (2023–24) – opening on 3 October and displaying until 15 March 2026.Explore more on these topicsArtRoyal Academy of ArtsLondonnewsShareReuse this content"

Alien: Earth’s ‘demon sheep eye’ is a work of true geniusSure, the xenomorph is an all-time great screen baddie – but it’s no match for the eyeball-octopus parasite stuffed in a sheep’s headStuart HeritageTue 23 Sep 2025 07.18 EDTLast modified on Tue 23 Sep 2025 13.15 EDTShareFrom the moment it was announced,Alien: Earthwas a bold punt. Ridley Scott’s movie (and James Cameron’s first sequel) painted the xenomorph as a classic baddie. It was unstoppable. It was seemingly unkillable. It was largely seen in flashes, and motivated only by death. Whenever subsequent movies attempted to broaden the alien’s mythology, its impact only diluted. So the thought of subjecting it to an entire television series – one designed to run for several years, no less – risked destroying it completely.‘Oh God no, Dad!’ The makers of TV’s most terrifying monsters reveal their repulsive secretsRead moreAnd yet Alien: Earth is a wild success. But this isn’t really to do with the xenomorph at all. Instead, almost every last atom of glory has been stolen by a new alien; one whose smarts, menace and weirdness trump almost anything the franchise has given us so far. Yes, it’s time to give the demon sheep eye its props.When the show was announced, the broad strokes of the plot – and all the promotional material – hinted at a series where a xenomorph would crash-land on Earth and run around murdering everyone for eight hours. This is partly true, but the show gambled on showing us some of the other extraterrestrial species that were captured in space at the same time.Key among them was trypanohyncha ocellus, a creature best described as a multi-irised eyeball bunged on to a set of octopus tentacles. Onboard the doomed spacecraft, the ocellus was able to sense danger and free itself from containment, unleashing untold horrors on its crew. In a flashback episode, we saw the ocellus burrow into the eye socket of its first host (a crew member played by Michael Smiley), giving him the intellectual ability to summon xenomorphs and (as seen in a battle where he hopped on to one’s back and bit it) the physical ability to cause them pain.However, as things stand, the ocellus’s definitive form so far has been the sheep. It has spent the bulk of the first season burrowed deep into the ocular socket of a regular woolly critter, which then became the most terrifying creature ever seen on television. Since being invaded by the ocellus, the sheep has done very little except stand in one fixed position, a parasitic eyeball bulging from the side of its face as it glowers menacingly at everything around it.View image in fullscreenUsurped … move over, xenomorph – there’s a new contender for the worst monster ever.Photograph: FlixPix/AlamyBut even with something as docile as a sheep for a host, the ocellus has unleashed havoc. It waited for an opportunity to ram the glass walls of its containment cell, distracting a scientist just long enough to be eaten. And, as of last week, we know that it can: a) identify pi to at least four digits; and b) poo when annoyed.The genius of the ocellus is how it stands in such stark contrast to the xenomorph. That creature is all instinct and reaction; this one waits and watches and coolly observes, figuring out the precise moment in which to cause maximum damage. What’s more, it is unquestionably malicious by design – and this is what makes it so utterly terrifying.Alien: Earth review – TV that bristles with bone-deep dreadRead moreIt should be noted that I am writing this before watching Wednesday’s finale. Based on last week’s episode, it seems as though the plan is to remove the ocellus from the sheep’s head and implant it into the head of a “lower IQ” human. We’ve already seen a hint of what it can do when nestled into a person’s skull, but the flashback episode did a fine job of obscuring many of its abilities. We know, at minimum, that it can talk to xenomorphs. But this is an ability shared with Sydney Chandler’s hybrid human, Wendy. How will a xenomorph react to two humanoids fighting for control of it? We should cross our fingers and hope that the finale is the Alien franchise’s Kramer vs Kramer moment.Beyond that, all bets are off. After all, given the devastation the ocellus has been able to wreak as a sheep, just think of all the horrors it could unleash on the world with a larger brain, communicable language and opposable thumbs.This is why the ocellus has been Alien: Earth’s secret weapon all along. A long-form television series cannot be sustained by the angry toddler histrionics of a xenomorph. But the ocellus can think. It can plot. It can evolve. It is a masterpiece of design and execution. And, providing nobody squishes it underfoot in the finale (which someone should probably at least try to), it is the alien that Earth most urgently needs to worry about.Alien: Earth is on Disney+ now. The finale airs on 24 September.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionAlienfeaturesShareReuse this content"

So what better time to revisit Brian Yuzna’s slimy obscenity Society? It’s a movie thatdefinitelythinks we should be taxing billionaires, and to make its point, Society throws an ending at you that you will never – ever – forget.Society’s entire reputation rests upon this finale and there is no discussion to be had without addressing the queasy and lurid final act. So please take this as both spoiler and content warning, and don’t blame me if you feel like your eyeballs need cleaning after seeing it.Bill Whitney (Billy Warlock) seems to have it all: he’s popular, has a steady girlfriend and is captain of his high school basketball team (despite being the shortest basketball player I’ve ever seen). But something about Bill’s life seems “off”.His family starts behaving secretively, he is plagued by night terrors and he comes to realise that his perfect life is merely artifice. He questions his own sanity when he accidentally walks in on his sister Jenny (Patrice Jennings) twisting her body into contorted and unnatural positions. But events finally come to a head when Bill’s school friend Blanchard (Tim Bartell) plays him an audio recording of his family discussing their disturbingly homicidal and inappropriately sexual weekend plans.Before Knives Out, there was Brick: Rian Johnson’s alluring, hard-boiled debutRead moreBill confides his fears to his therapist Dr Cleveland (Ben Slack) who suggests he is having paranoid delusions. But to quote Joseph Heller: “Just because you’re paranoid doesn’t mean they’re not after you.”Shortly afterwards, Blanchard turns up dead.Soon enough, Bill uncovers a wide-reaching conspiracy involving his social circle. When he finally confronts them at an opulent party, their true nature is revealed as an ancient species who have always lived among us. They prey upon the lower class in a grotesque ritual known as The Shunt.View image in fullscreenSociety’s conclusion may be twisted, but the film portrays the affluent as seedy, entitled and repellent even before they turn into a living sludge.Photograph: Pictorial Press Ltd/AlamyThe rich partygoers meld into one another in a writhing mass of slippery limbs and unidentified orifices. It’s not “eat the rich” but the rich eating us: they feast upon their captives in a deranged orgy of sex and gluttony. It’s a conclusion straight from the mind of Japanese special effects wizard Screaming Mad George – whose credits also include Predator and several Nightmare on Elm Street entries.Society’s conclusion may be twisted, but the film portrays the affluent as seedy, entitled and repellent even before they turn into a living sludge. The soundtrack’s use of the deeply irritating Eton Boating Song is a masterstroke; its moneyed pomp subliminally grates your every last nerve.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSaved for LaterFree newsletterCatch up on the fun stuff with Guardian Australia's culture and lifestyle rundown of pop culture, trends and tipsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It’s Alan (Partridge)– a new series featuring him returning to the UK having been doing promotional work in Saudi Arabia and attempting to rebuild his career through a documentary about mental health.It has been four years since Partridge last appeared on the BBC. Coogan says he and his co-writers bring the veteran presenter back when there is something to say about UK culture and society.The actor said Partridge was a “good conduit” to discuss “popular culture … and things that are difficult. Or say things that are perhaps taboo or would be difficult to talk about as … a private person.”“You [can] say things through the character or talk about stuff that’s potentially problematic,” Coogan said, adding: “It’s good to talk about stuff that is seen as taboo, not just to be provocative, but because you actually can, weirdly, shine a light on it and be more honest about it in some ways, by using Alan.“It feels relevant to do stuff which … gives people anxiety. It’s a way of talking about stuff that people can’t normally talk about. It’s a sort of Trojan horse.”He continued: “We highlight things by showing Alan’s small mindedness and prejudice, but sometimes he stumbles accidentally on shining a light on something, and can say that the emperor’s not wearing any clothes [and] say the unsayable.”Speaking at a screening of the new show in London, Coogan also said Partridge – who first appeared in 1991 Radio 4 series On the Hour – was now popular with gen Z, especially on TikTok, because, “that generation sees their parents in Partridge. They see that sort of trying to be relevant or not square, trying to be on message somehow, and that struggle of trying to be hip with their kids.”The show’s co-writers and directors, Neil and Rob Gibbons, said Partridge was also a “reflection of a lot of white, middle-aged, middle-class men of a certain age … the world’s changed too fast for them and they’re actually really scared [and] don’t really know what to do about it.”They added: “As soon as we started talking about Saudi Arabia, then we were interested.” During the series, Partridge is shown doing Saudi Arabia promos after work dries up after a disastrous stint hosting fictitious The One Show-style programme This Time.Coogan added he liked the Saudi scenes “because it makes me feel anxious watching it”.Partridge also reflects the concerns of some older presenters when he is shown panicking after accidentally playing an old audition tape of him doing an Asian accent.In a time when male hosts have lost their jobs due to their previous behaviour, Coogan said Alan would “definitely” be worried about being cancelled: “He feels the walls closing in, so he’s rapidly trying to think of an escape plan” by putting “on a millennial uniform”, shown by his attempt to tap into the trend for celebrities talking about mental health.“We have to build in to the premise ways that Alan can have jeopardy surrounded. So you have to give him a high wire. And mental health is obviously a subject that he knows very little about,” said Coogan.The character has also been given a domineering new girlfriend Katrina, whom he describes as, “one of the fittest women over 40 in Norfolk” and whom, the Gibbons brothers said, was originally based on Liz Truss.How Are You?

I’m a big fan of the movie and wanted to be a dancer when I was a kid, so this really hit the spot.The song I do at karaokeI’ve tried to do the odd hip-hop track like The Real Slim Shady by Eminem. One minute you’re like: I’ve got the flow on! Then it backfires because you realise: I don’t know all the words. Also, hip-hop just sounds terrible in a New Zealand accent.

A new podcast uncovers the sinister side of what happens when Brits throw things awayDaniel Dylan WrayTue 23 Sep 2025 04.55 EDTLast modified on Tue 23 Sep 2025 05.04 EDTShareOn his way to a remote industrial zone at the edge of Istanbul, Adnan Khan compares it to something out of Mad Max. Packs of wild dogs roam around desolate wastelands; toxic chemicals spill out into the street, with corrugated metal sheets and “slapdash factories” scattered around. “It’s like a shantytown,” he says.However, once he sets foot inside some of these factories, he reaches for a different cinematic comparison. This time he’s thinking of the torture-horror filmSaw, as he witnesses Afghan refugees working and living in conditions that he says fit the UN definition of modern-day slavery.Khan, a journalist, had been visiting three young men working in a factory – Samim, Hayat and Khalid – every week as he researched a story about refugee workers in the recycling industry. Then one day in 2022, Hayat asked Khan: “Did you hear what happened to Arifullah Fazli?” He showed Khan a photo on his phone of a young man who worked in a different factory. It was a harrowing image: a lifeless body, legs missing, laid out on the floor surrounded by piles of trash. He had been killed in an accident involving a recycling compactor machine.“The moment I was shown his body was such a shock,” says Khan. “The story became much bigger.”View image in fullscreenArifullah Fazli (left) with a friend in the mountains in eastern Afghanistan.Photograph: Unknown/Courtesy Adnan Khan via Afghan refugeesThe ensuing investigation has resulted in a three-part podcast series, Boy Wasted. It is produced by the team behind the BBC’s award-winning investigative podcast,Buried, and published by the environmental news titleENDS Report and the Dutch magazine De Groene Amsterdammer. It reveals that Afghan refugees are not only being exploitedby unscrupulous recycling factory owners, living in fear of deportation with no power or agency and working in perilous conditions – they are also dying at alarming rates while sorting through our rubbish. The UK exports thousands of tonnes of plastic waste to Turkey every year.“We thought we were looking into one mysterious body,” says Dan Ashby, one of the podcast’s producers and hosts, along with Lucy Taylor and Khan. “But what emerged was a whole broken system that is full of criminality and death.”As part of the investigation, the organisation İSİG Meclisi, which tracks workplace deaths inTurkey, carried out the first ever analysis of workplace deaths in Turkish recycling. It revealed deeply troubling findings. The researchers discovered that two people are crushed, ripped or burned to death in the recycling sector every month, and this has been the case for the last decade.“I just couldn’t believe it when these numbers started coming out,” says Ashby. “More than 200 boys and men have died in the last 10 years. So it then became an inquiry into: what are we doing with our plastic? What kind of workplaces is this enabling? What kind of organised crime is there?”The rubbish industry is a huge one. “Britain’s biggest export is waste,” says Ashby. “That’s what we make the most of now.” It has become so vast and profitable – and in many cases unregulated and unchecked – that one Environment Agency worker who features in the podcast describes it as being like “the wild west” and says that “waste crime is the new narcotics”. It’s a mammoth task to tackle.“A fifth of UK waste now passes through criminal hands,” says Taylor. “I’m sure the Environment Agency are doing everything they can with the resources they have, but there are only five full-time officers checking all the waste coming out of England’s ports.” Approximately 9m waste containers pass through UK ports every year, but only 0.02% are being inspected. “So when that waste arrives in Istanbul and isn’t what it’s supposed to be, it’s passed on to more and more dodgy smaller businesses,” says Taylor. “And they don’t have to do what they should do with it because no one’s checking.”View image in fullscreenIn the factory, Hayat speaks to his family in Afghanistan.Photograph: Adnan Khan/Via Afghan refugeesSince China banned plastic waste imports in 2018, Turkey has become a top destination for exports of plastic, with more illegal factories popping up to meet demand. There have already been reports that this plastic ends up being burned instead of recycled.Boy Wasted unearths a sinister picture of the human cost. It looks into cover-ups, payoffs and bribes, as well as a widespread indifference to the deaths of refugees, who, Khan says, are treated as “subhuman” and like animals. “Everybody is aware and it’s totally in the open,” he adds. “One boss literally said to me at a recycling facility: ‘My business wouldn’t survive without these people. We need the cheap labour for this industry to survive.’” Some of the undocumented workers work 14- to 16-hour days and live in storage cupboards inside the factories, with no access to running water or toilets.The industry is so reliant on exploiting this workforce that companies budget for compensation money to be paid to their families in the event of their deaths. In the podcast, Aslı Odman of İSİG Meclisi refers to this as “blood money”.“It’s accounted for in businesses,” says Ashby. “The idea that you don’t pay insurance or you don’t get safe equipment because it’s cheaper just to lose lives … that is such gross negligence and awful callousness towards human life that I can’t even think of a word for it.” Odman does find the word for it, though. “I think we have the right to call it murder,” she says in the series.‘Plastic recycling is a myth’: what really happens to your rubbish?Read moreThe podcast is an arresting and horrific insight into the link between consumption, waste and the loss of human life. It’s also a story that Ashby feels is especially timely. “With the great dehumanising of refugees in Europe and Britain that is going on, we’ve set out to humanise these people and to inhabit their world every single part of the way,” he says. “I hope even if listeners don’t care about plastic and the environment, it might be interesting from that perspective.”Aside from conveying empathy during a time of widespread cruelty, there’s also a searing environmental message burned into the show. “By sending so much dodgy waste out into the world, we are creating this system,” says Ashby. “We enable the deaths of refugees. Not just Britain – there’s other countries as well – but Britain is one of the biggest exporters to Turkey. They call it ‘waste colonialism’, and no longer can we just send out our toxicities to the rest of the world.“We cannot continue with creating this enormous tide of plastic. This is a scandal hiding in plain sight and we cannot turn a blind eye.”Boy Wasted is available via ENDS Report’s Eco Chamber podcast, wherever you get your podcasts.Explore more on these topicsPodcastsWasteRecyclingTurkeyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I discover it on muddy football pitches in east London, with the smell of chips drifting from the van at half-time; in rented cricket halls in Bradford where there is always a giant urn of tea bubbling in the corner. The sounds that have shaped me as a Black British person aren’t designed by algorithms or commissioned by labels. They come from battered speakers balanced on trestle tables, bhangra basslines rattling the walls of community centres in Southall and WhatsApp threads buzzing long after everyone has gone home.I remember attending a Somali football league in east London where the match ended but no one left. The players, still in muddy boots, piled into the clubhouse to eat rice from foil trays while a DJ wired up his decks at the side of the pitch. The final whistle had barely faded before Sneakbo’s The Wave ripped across the park, the chorus bouncing off the goalposts like an anthem and propelling players and families to move. A few weeks later, in Bradford, I was in a cricket club that had become a bhangra night. Aunties juggled trays of samosas and paper cups of tea as the floor shook to the pounding rhythm of British-Asian bhangra pioneersAlaap’s take on traditional Heer Ranjha, a song older than most of the crowd but carried with fresh force through second and third-generations. It wasn’t glamorous, but it was unforgettable. And here, too, the loop revealed itself. Sport gathered the people, music deepened the connection, and that connection made space for the next track, the next party, the next young talent.I also remember the first time a track reached me through a WhatsApp group that no algorithm would ever find. A cousin in Birmingham forwarded me a digitised cassette of Hasan Cihat Örter’s Sevgiye Zaman Ver, a Turkish instrumental that sounded as if it had been recorded underwater. The file had been passed from uncle to uncle across three countries before it landed in my phone. By the end of the week, it was soundtracking a Sunday league after-party in Walthamstow. That single song created a thread of conversations, remixes and even a teenager trying to sample it for a drill track.TikTok and Spotify may shape music popularity, but virality doesn’t just exist online. My phone is always pinging with new music from outside the algorithm and across the diaspora. Aunties send gospel remixes with laughing emojis, cousins drop raw Warsaw drill tracks such as Lola by Żabson and friends digitise Somali oud tapes that are not on any streaming platform. Within hours, a playlist builds itself out of scraps, memes and masterpieces. It is chaotic, but it is magic.What excites me most about these digital and real-life spaces is how generative they are, a cycle of care and creativity that the official industry cannot replicate, no matter how much data it crunches or how many trends it tries to chase. These networks recycle energy and form their own kind of musical infrastructure. Aunties book DJs to raise money for sports kit, then the cricket fundraiser doubles as a rave. Kids test their first bars at the end of a match and get cheers from a crowd who know their names. The applause gives them confidence to come back with another verse, another set, another story.And in a Britain where public spaces are shrinking and funding for youth centres and the arts gets cut year after year, these grassroots networks feel like resistance. They are proof that joy cannot be legislated out of existence. People will always find ways to gather, to dance, to share songs that make them feel alive.Yet too often, these diasporic exchanges and cultural networks are pushed to the margins of Britain’s mainstream music narrative. Despite their energy and influence, they rarely receive the same visibility or institutional support as other scenes that emerge with commercial polish or industry connections. Instead they are written off as niche or “local”, even as their sounds quietly shape the pulse of British music. That neglect matters, because it speaks to whose voices are amplified as part of the national story, and whose contributions are left unheard. For me, these networks are the reason I fell in love with music in the first place. They show me that you do not need slick studios or industry backing to build something that matters. You just need a room, some speakers, a crowd, and the will to keep going.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSleeve NotesFree weekly newsletterGet music news, bold reviews and unexpected extras.

I would point to the Morley’s fried chicken shops lit up after midnight, dancehall spilling from a car parked outside. The school sports days in east London where a Bluetooth speaker sneaks in under the teacher’s desk and suddenly the whole class is moving. The community centres that smell of carpet cleaner and curry where a DJ plugs into a socket that barely works. The football pitch that turns into a dancefloor once the floodlights go out. Because in these spaces, music and community do not just coexist. They create each other, over and over again. The future of our music is not written by algorithm.

But anybody who’s anybody knows he goes by Boydy! Because of the time he once caught a ball, and ran around for a week, shouting, ‘I’m just like a real boy!’.”Like any jargon, it’s a system designed to dominate and exclude, dressed up in the language – not really language, more like mouth-noises – of the nursery, but reader, you do not have time to get irritated by this, because you will need all your resources of patience to get to the end of the sentence, without thinking: who cares whether he’s the 9th Duke of Marlborough? Who knows which century the 6th Duke was in? I bet the Spencer-Churchills don’t even know!In the end, the problem with any history of modern British aristocracy like Eleanor Doughty’s is not the implicit contempt of a class that believes in its own superiority to the extent that it considers the nicknames of its great-grandmother’s lurchers worthy of your time, yet will look you in the eye and tell you that hard work and merit are all that count – or to put that another way, piss on your shoes and tell you it’s raining.The problem isn’t even the posh-adjacent, their not-quite-aristo-enough army of admirers who’ll die on the hill of these people being fascinating, in which Doughty is an awesomely diligent officer. No, the real problem, from a narrative perspective, is that every sentence is loaded with so much extraneous information – where that character sits, not just in relation to the inheritance of their nearest stately home, but in relation to the queen, to their closest duke-by-marriage, to the second-cousin-twice-removed who would have pipped them to the pile were it not for his untimely death – that no amount of punctuation in the world can even rescue its syntax, still less hold your interest.So Henry “Master” Somerset, a notorious philanderer, “was asked at dinner by the wife of his heir presumptive, his first cousin twice removed David Somerset, who he considered the greatest man of the 20th century, [and] he opted, not for such an obvious figure as Winston Churchill, but Bernard Norfolk, ‘for his splendid work as chair of the Marylebone Cricket Club’.” The answer is maybefleetinglyinteresting but why does it matter who asked him? What’s David Somerset even doing in this sentence? Every story (and some of them could be diverting, there are some interesting deaths – in a biplane with a mistress; of alcoholism) is like watching a baby bird try to fly, except its tiny wings have been dipped in the cement of dynastic detail that tells you nothing at all about the human, yet is the only measure of his value.“Master” Somerset, by the way, wasn’t a good guy. “Pumped full of an extraordinarily exalted sense of self-worth and entitlement, he had little truck with good manners,” Doughty writes, going on to report a load of anecdotes in which Master is a prick. Effing and jeffing. Telling off proles for not moving fast enough, getting angry at dogs. In all this elaborate preservation of the bloodline, who bred out all the happy people?All that said, Doughty’s expertise jumps off the page. She started her career as a journalist on the Telegraph, and wrote their Great Estates column from 2017 (who even knew they had one of those? It’s like the Guardian and tofu, except their obsession connotes a value system that destroys its own young, whereas ours is just a tasty, proteinous ingredient). She knows everything – where an earl sits relative to a viscount, how many there are of each. Her work is peppered with first-hand accounts, piquant details from visitors’ books, the story of every great house told brick by brick, through centuries of wealth and turbulence. If the whole saga is weighed down by its own self-regard, it takes pluck and determination to leaven it, and Doughty has those in undeniable quantities.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

The punchline is long Covid, an illness that defies narrative – dissolves it. Patricia Lockwood’s new autofiction, Will There Ever Be Another You, is the product of that cruel dissolution. “I wrote it insane, and edited it sane,” she explained in a recent interview. The madness is the method. But must you know the mind before you can know the madness?Lockwood is the literary Frankenchild of Dorothy Parker and Flannery O’Connor: a heretical wit fused with gothic strangeness, vintage quippery rewired for the digital age. She’s the kind of writer who inspires parasocial devotion and copycat haircuts. Even her cats are internet-famous. The sacred text of Lockwood lore isPriestdaddy, her glorious 2017 memoir, which introduced readers to the American author’s trouser-resistant father, an ordained Catholic priest who blew his daughter’s college fund on a vintage guitar.The pandemic handed Lockwood a new absurdity. She contracted Covid early, in March of 2020, when transmission was blamed on grotty fingers and every doorknob was suspect – the era of fruit bleaching and handwashing jingles. She was among the first writers to give shape to the cognitive estrangement of the virus, its febrile illogic. “Hours, days of my memory had fallen out of my mind like chunks of plaster,” shewrote that July, as if the worst was behind her.Will There Ever Be Another You is the tale of what happened next, inflicted on a fictional Patricia: aphasia, hallucination, migraines, amnesia, paranoia, relentless self-obliteration. Can a novel carry that skull-fire without being consumed by it? That is the wager of this book.“What are you working on?” people kept asking me. Little stories, I would evade, and leave it at that, because if to write about being ill was self-indulgent, what followed was that the most self-indulgent thing of all was to be ill. But I was determined to do it. I was going to write a masterpiece about being confused.The result is cortical shrapnel – you can almost hear this book rattle when you open it. Lockwood’s title carries no question mark: it is prayer, punchline, eulogy, manifesto, nightmare, often all at once. Fragmentation is not a new mode for Lockwood (she was christened, after all, “the poet laureate of Twitter”). But it is one thing to disrupt, another to be disrupted. There is a new kind of anguish here, a longing for coherence.The book feels like the literary equivalent of a Wes Anderson film: over-styled and perilously close to self-parodyThe opening pages are where she comes closest. Hollowed by the loss of a child, an American family travels through Scotland, kept afloat by “pure itinerary”. A precious item is lost. Shortly afterwards, our heroine slips into fever. The treasure is returned; her mind is not. It feels like a dark enchantment, a faerie bargain. “It stole people from themselves.” Lockwood writes of her illness. “You might look the same to others, but you had been replaced.”Delirium reigns. We wheel from Roland Barthes to Cabbage Patch Kids, via Anna Karenina and the “butthole cut of Cats” (classic Lockwood territory). But there’s a drum of obsession beating underneath the chaos. Doppelgangers, changelings, clones, dolls; photographs and synonyms – these pages teem with replicants and replication. The modus operandi of a virus.It’s time to rouse the ghosts of Virginia Woolf and Susan Sontag: the patron saints of sicklit. Critics invoke Woolf to show how difficult it is to pin illness to the page (“English … has no words for the shiver and the headache”); Sontag to mark the grief of displacement (“the kingdom of the sick”). Woolf makes illness mystical; Sontag makes it ordinary. It has always been both. It’s time the conversation deepened. Our stories certainly have.A hundred years have passed since Woolf complained that literature ignored the body; now, it’s a site of wild and magnificent invention. Katherine Brabon’s novel Body Friend (2023) gives chronic pain human form, like an intimate version of Fight Club; Sanya Rushdi’s account of psychosis is so lucid it unsettles the very notion of madness (Hospital, 2023; translated by Arunava Sinha); Kris Kneen’s An Uncertain Grace (2017) is an orgy of transformations and transgressions: erotic, technological, and ecological. These are just three books within arm’s reach (all happen to be by brilliant Aussies).Across all forms and genres, writers are breaking taboos – of decorum, shame and syntax – to exalt in our corruptible flesh. There’s Ottessa Moshfegh’s metaphysical collapse (My Year of Rest and Relaxation), andHanya Yanagihara’s baroque trauma (A Little Life). Kazuo Ishiguro’s robots and clones; Jeff Vandermeer’s spores and mutations; the ravenous and rotting world of body horror. The body is no longer an absence, it’s a stage.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

We need accounts of long Covid, and plenty more of them. But Will There Ever Be Another You feels auteurish, the literary equivalent of a Wes Anderson film: over-styled and perilously close to self-parody. A delirious in-joke.Online and on the page, Lockwood’s brilliance has always been her ability to strip a joke back to its mechanics, and – somehow – make it sharper in the disassembly (see her viral poemRape Joke). But that power has begun to turn in on itself. Her first novel,No One Is Talking About This(a prequel of sorts), assumed a fluency in the language of the internet, known as “the portal”; Will There Ever Be Another You assumes a fluency in Lockwood.Fandom is the price of entry here: not just a familiarity with the cult author’s work, but with her life: her estrangements and griefs, her delights and obsessions, even the precarious state of her husband’s bowels. Maggie Nelson’s most recent book,Pathemata, read the same way: privileging intimacy over literacy. Nelson was also writing about chronic pain, and perhaps that’s no coincidence. Pain traps you deep inside your own brainbox; Will There Ever Be Another You recreates that trap. But how you read it – how you areableto read it – depends on your relationship to Lockwood. And this book assumes you already have one.Will There Ever Be Another You by Patricia Lockwood is published by Bloomsbury Circus (£16.99).

It follows the now familiar format, with our host narrating his life and works in story, lots of clips on an upstage screen – and in song.

But it’d be hard for Idle to tell his tale otherwise, as we follow him from university revue with Bill Oddie and Tim Brooke-Taylor, to domestic comedy stardom with Python and “mock’n’roll” icon status in the US. We see him hosting Saturday Night Live next toJohn Belushi. We hear how Elvis Presley’s girlfriend told our starry-eyed host how Presley performed Idle’s sketches in bed.Happily, Idle retains a personality that seems immune to pomposity. Call him the anti-Cleese: his erstwhile bandmate receives a good-natured ribbing tonight. We get a handful of Python sketches onscreen (Nudge Nudge; the Queen Victoria Handicap), and a clip of the interview when the team “accidentally” spilled Graham Chapman’s ashes on live TV. We also get a long medley ofhis Beatles spoof the Rutles, an extract from his supposed Diary of a Legend, mocking his national treasure status, and a performance (in virtual duet with American clown Puddles) of his cosmos-sounding Galaxy Song from the Python’s 1983 film The Meaning of Life.No profound meaning of life is ventured by this octogenarian tonight, in what Idle jokes might be the last time we hear from him – not only because he might die soon, but because his audience might, too. But, in a show with an unmistakably elegiac undertone, Idle does conclude that his job has always been simply to cheer people up – cue a rendition of the signature song that’s helped us all digest life’s gristle for 46 years now and counting. If at times it’s not just nostalgia but nostalgia-squared tonight, at least Idle has a lot worth being nostalgic about.AtPavilion theatre, Bournemouth, on 24 September andRoyal Albert Hall, London, on 27 SeptemberExplore more on these topicsComedyEric IdleMonty PythonJohn CleesereviewsShareReuse this content"

Queer kisses, shamanistic gurgling, miles of VHS tape and lasers in the jungle. This year’sTurner prizeexhibition opens this Saturday at Cartwright Hall in Bradford, the current UK city of culture.A soundtrack of a 16th-century Lutheran hymn and peals of church bells create an unresolvable conflict with the small photographs trapped behind glass on a low shelf inRene Matić’s installation. The voices of Nina Simone and bell hooks are dragged from the ether, along with the chants of trans rights activists and commuters calling for a free Palestine. Rihanna sings Lift Me Up a cappella as I go from snapshot to snapshot, looking for the story amid the club scenes and marches, the street graffiti and a baby in a bath. Here’s an elderly man in hospital, then lipstick and cigarettes and a page from a remembrance book: “Dad, Our Hero, VIP, Legend” reads the dedication.All these scenes, I take it, are from Matić’s life. It is all a mix of the personal and the political. I think of Nan Goldin and of a life being lived and documented. The artist, 28, displays their affinities in an installation that feels at once rich and sparse, restrained and confessional.View image in fullscreenRene Matić: mixing the personal and political.Photograph: David Levene/The GuardianBehind me, a huge printed cotton drop-cloth sags in space, as if it has run out of energy, or belief, or something. NO PLACE reads one side, FOR VIOLENCE, the other. Although repeating the calls for peace in response to the assassination attempt on Donald Trump’s life while he was on the campaign trail in 2024, there’s more than one way to read the banner. The private and the public, what’s background and what is foreground in the mixed race, gender fluid, working-class artist’s life? Peace and protest, friendship and family are all mixed together, along with contested ideas of nationhood and belonging. And what of Matić’s collection of black dolls, staring from their shelves, set into a pinkish brown wall? It all adds up to a frozen autobiographical tableau, suspended and ambiguous, like that banner, caught in the middle of things.Equally unsettling and deliberately ambiguous,Mohammed Sami’s paintings intimate violence. Broken crockery under an exploding sky. Clothing suspended in water, like the last view of someone drowning in a tank. A horseshoe-scuffed and trampled patch of ground where something or someone has been dragged from a field of sunflowers. A vast panoramic view of wind-thrashed palms in an orange haze, where green lasers blitz the undergrowth. It’s like a frozen screen in a stalled video game.An abandoned table and chairs are caught by a surveillance camera overhead, the view obstructed by the menacing shadow of a thwapping ceiling fan. Sami showed several of these heavily worked canvaseslast year, hung among the old masters and heirlooms at Blenheim Palace, a collision of past imperial might and modern violence, by an artist who began his career paintingofficial portraits of Saddam Hussein in Baghdad.View image in fullscreenMohammed Sami: too much painterly heavy breathing.Photograph: David Levene/The GuardianSami has always been good, like Luc Tuymans, at intimating catastrophe and violence in his unpeopled paintings, but it strikes me that his recent work has become technically a lot more tricksy, in the manner of Anselm Kiefer and Miquel Barceló. All that painterly heavy breathing gets in the way, and the more Sami does, the less I believe in it.Here come sounds again. This time, tinkling bells, whale song and radiophonic whoops, wind-chimes and the insistent warble of an old telephone. I was backing out of Vancouver-born Korean artistZadie Xa’s installation even as I shuffled across the shiny gold metallic floor in my specially provided overshoes, so as not to spoil the perfect sheen. The sounds all emanate from dangling giant artificial seashells. Undersea light drifts across the walls and tiny shamanic bells hang in a conch-like spiral over an octagonal dais shimmering with rainbow reflections, the whole thing mirrored in the floor under my feet.View image in fullscreenZadie Xa: overwrought and overthought.Photograph: David Levene/The GuardianThe paintings that line the walls are rife with folkloric Korean figures, skeletal musicians, swimming dolphins, passing squid and sea-turtles. This woozy, overwrought and overthought exercise in luxury brand shamanism is as excessive as it is unnecessary. The title, Moonlit Confessions Across Deep Sea Echoes: Your Ancestors Are Whales, and Earth Remembers Everything, says it all.Everybody’s got a spiel nowadays, and Xa’s is particularly unctuous. Everyone also has a story, as if that might explain everything. Ten large sculptures hang in space, melding and separating as you move around and between them.Nnena Kaluworks by repetitive binding and wrapping, knotting and furling, layer on layer, working on simple armatures with adhesive tapes, clingfilm, repurposed plastics, fabrics, cable ties, VHS tape, cardboard and spillage of manufactured, spun and extruded materials. Her additive, repetitive process depends on the artist’s reach, her concentration and persistence. Her sculptures are always the same and always different. They rise above us, reaching out or snarling in on themselves. They’re bound and unbound and filled with variety. These embodied forms have a complex physicality. I think of heads and torsos, arses, necks, bellies and manes, the human and the animal. They bulk and extrude, twist and float.People often talk of this or that artist being a force of nature, and of being driven. Neither artistic gifts nor disabilities are to be dismissed, as necessary as they are a hindrance. Born in Glasgow in 1966 Kalu is an autistic, learning disabled artist with limited verbal communication. Supported by visual arts organisation Actionspace, Kalu’s primary assistant, Charlotte Hollinshead, has worked with her since 1999, and describes her role as “a glorified assistant”, insisting that Kalu has total control of her art.Her work is irreducible. There’s a horizon to what we can know. Kalu’s sculptures have been compared to Phyllida Barlow and the fibre art of Sheila Hicks. One might also think of the complex, many-layered sculptures of American artistJudith Scott(1943-2005), who also worked with severe physical and mental limitations, finding her way after years of institutionalisation and neglect. Repetition and compulsiveness were also at the root of the immense corpus of work made by German artistHanne Darboven(1941-2009), who worked within rigorous self-imposed systems and constraints.View image in fullscreenCompelling … Kalu at work.Photograph: Courtesy of the Artist and ActionSpaceKalu works between the elective and the given. This is as true of her drawings as it is of her sculptural works. The repetitive spiralling vortices of her drawings all depend as much on where she leaves off, on their returns and alterations, on flow and variation, as they do on the body transcribing its actions on to paper. They are riotous and rhythmic, purposeful and compelling. There’s no fudging. Kalu deserves to win this year’s Turner prize.Turner prize 2025 is at Cartwright Hall Art Gallery,Bradford, from 27 September to 22 FebruaryExplore more on these topicsTurner prizeArtBradfordInstallationSculpturePaintingreviewsShareReuse this content"

Emma (Amelia Kenworthy) is a serious-minded type, albeit still insufferably self-regarding and judgy. She has just failed her finals at Oxford University and is in a state of emotional meltdown when she returns home to begin meddling in the lives of all around her.Her sister, Isabella (Jessica Brindle), loves fake tans and Elton (Bobby Lockwood) is an oily estate agent in sockless loafers. Emma’s biggest critic and secret admirer, George Knightley (Kit Young), is a builder and brother to oafish John (Adrian Richards), who is getting married to Isabella. Mr Woodhouse (Nigel Lindsay) is still a widower but also a latter-day Del Boy furtively carrying on with Mrs Bates (Lucy Benjamin), a beautician, while Harriet (Sofia Oxenham), kooky and hapless in love, works in the local Co-op.The central class switch – from genteel society to estuary England – is an inspired stroke by Pickett but the script is laden with over-familiar Essex tropes, and you wish for the gimlet-eyed observation and texture of Austen’s world above this broadness. Where Pickett’s historical drama1536, staged at the Almeida theatre, resonated magnificently for our time, this seems strangely old-fashioned in its TV sitcom format, despite the modern updating.View image in fullscreenCarefully observed … Sofia Oxenham as Harriet and Amelia Kenworthy as Emma.Photograph: Marc BrennerThe book’s complex web of goings-on are streamlined, arguably for the better, but characters are gratingly exaggerated. That strips the pathos, so it is hard to feel for them as they contend with various romantic wobbles.Under Christopher Haydon’s direction, characters run in and out, trip, hide and snog comically. The action edges from social satire, of sorts, to full-on revolving-door farce and clowning, high-pitched and hysterical, in the second half.The pumping music and lights carry you along while Lily Arnold’s set design of a modern house with a Regency-inflected interior (creams, mint green, elegant stripes) brings subtlety that the script lacks.‘I don’t buy it’ … Ava Pickett on her play about Anne Boleyn’s treason and incestRead morePickett certainly captures the heart of a young, arrogant woman who has a “disposition to think too well of herself”, too. But her talk of patriarchy, feminism and consumerism is not sharp enough to serve as social commentary or satire. Her tips on empowerment are too quickly accepted by Mrs Bates, Harriet and John so that they act in unlikely ways – even within the bounds of a farce. And you do not quite catch the heat and smoulder of George and Emma’s sublimated desire until rather too late.There are some comic zingers and warm moments, Emma and Harriet’s close female friendship is carefully observed, and Kenworthy and Oxenham make spirited professional stage debuts. The few earnest scenes towards the end are so full of heart, emotion and impactful stillness that they reveal glimpses of what the play might have been beneath its head of froth.AtRose theatre, Kingston upon Thames, until 11 OctoberExplore more on these topicsTheatreJane AustenComedy (Stage)Comedy (Culture)reviewsShareReuse this content"

You can sample it in a “multi-sensory reflective space” created to display a Monet landscape lent by the National Gallery, one part of a constellation of exhibitions and events centred around the question: Can We Stop Killing Each Other? But by this point the only question I was asking is, why did I fall for it and make the trip to this glass house on the University of East Anglia campus?Jago Cooper, its director, is full of bright ideas. He’s set out to inject energy into the home of the Robert and Lisa Sainsbury Collection with such wheezes as declaring all its artworks to be “alive” – and staging shows around Big Questions of Our Time. Maybe this particular question is too big, but I think if it had been broken down and some logical clarity applied there might have been something to say – instead of saying nothing, which is what this windy absence does.Monet’s beguiling 1872 painting The Little Arm of the Seine at Argenteuil, which depicts a foggy day in the French countryside, is supposed to make us reflect on peace (but what if the light on the river interests me more?) in a setting the Centre seriously claims is a prototype “to develop and research trauma-informed cafes as part of the Sainsbury Centre’s Compassionate Museum programme”. But all the Monet room really does is typify the way random elements have been thrown together here with nothing but gibberish to tie them together.View image in fullscreenPeaceful reflection? … Monet’s The Little Arm of the Seine at Argenteuil, 1872.Photograph: Copyright The National GalleryEqually mystifying is Anton Forde’s Tiaki Ora, a gathering of wooden monoliths in the bright ground floor space. There is a historical and anthropological backstory but it makes no visual difference. Humanoid, figurative yet slipping into sacred-seeming abstraction, the carvings stand in a triangular formation with potted plants between them. To look at and walk among them, the effect is as bland as a garden centre.Sadly, in art as in music, the devil has the best tunes. Another exhibition, Eyewitness, is a survey of the dramatisation of killing in art, cinema and other global cultural forms. It sounds meaty but drifts into irrelevance. How can you have an exhibition about images of violence that does not gratify some need or desire to see violence? – the curators appear to have wondered. You can’t, and its only good moments are gory ones. Hogarth’s Four Stages of Cruelty prints, in which the brutalisation of a youth on the streets of 18th-century London leads him to kill a woman before being judicially killed himself and disembowelled by anatomists is shown beside Mat Collishaw’s photographs of the last meals chosen by prisoners on death row in the US. Arranged and lit like Dutch still-life paintings, these reconstructions of actual last meals chosen have devastating pathos.View image in fullscreenDevastating pathos … Mat Collishaw’s Last Meal on Death Row, Texas; Martin Vegas (framed).Photograph: Courtesy the artistBut that’s all too disturbing. Next up is a section on puppet theatre in India, then a ponderous display of Punch and Judy puppets. Things get even more eccentric and timid with a section on Shakespeare in which there are lots of cardboard cutout characters, toy theatres and third-rate Victorian paintings of tragic characters. It is impossible to fathom why any of this belongs in an exhibition about violence.At least Christian Marclay’s video installation Crossfire has violence in it. You stand surrounded by four screens, with clips of Hollywood gunfire all around you, caught in the crossfire. But coopting it as a condemnation of Hollywood violence risks exposing a shallowness in the work. Crossfire removes the context to make the shooting comically inane, but is movie violence always meaningless or can it in fact (as in Shakespeare) have dramatic power and truth? Marclay uses the final frames of Martin Scorsese’s Goodfellas with Tommy shooting at the audience. But Scorsese is a serious, moral artist, his use of violence a long way from meaningless. You would learn far more about human evil from watching Goodfellas at home.Then Eyewitness is over and there is another show by Ethiopian painter Tesfaye Urgessa, whose impassioned depictions of the human figure have nothing to do with the theme of violence. The wall texts make a vague link, but by this time this megalomaniac dream of solving global problems with puppets and toy theatres had lost me. It is utterly bonkers.Can We Stop Killing Each Other? is atSainsbury Centre, Norwich, until 17 May 2026Explore more on these topicsArt and designExhibitionsreviewsShareReuse this content"

It was loosely inspired bya 2019 Cosompolitan articlethat describes an investigator known as the Savant as “an elite investigator who tracks angry men online”.In the trailer, her character warns: “Snipers, bombings, ambushes, we’re on the verge of serious violence.” She adds: “This guy isn’t just planning violence, he’s out to make a statement … innocent Americans are going to die”.“I hate that this show is relevant,” Chastain said in an interview with theRadio Times. “I hate it. I hate that there are mass acts of violence. But maybe through this conversation and through unearthing this darkness in society, then we’re gonna work together to fix it.”While Apple did not elaborate on the decision, it comes soon after the killing of rightwing commentator Charlie Kirk at at Utah Valley University. Prosecutors have charged 22-year-old Tyler Robinson with the crime with text messages appearing to show the act was motivated by wanting to stop Kirk’s “hatred”.While reviews are embargoed, the Irish Independent’s Pat StaceycalledThe Savant “a thriller depicting the ugliness of white supremacist extremism in the United States”. The trailer also features threats of “a coordinated mass attack” and words on-screen mention that between 1994 and 2020, there were 893 extremist attacks in America.The Oscar-winning actor, who was named best actress for her role in The Eyes of Tammy Faye, called its timeliness “upsetting” in an interview withEmmy magazinebefore referring to “what just happened in Minnesota”, signalling toward the killing of Melissa Hortman.

It’s a valid question because, while SDH is the default subtitle format on most platforms, the humans behind it – as with all creative industries – are being increasingly devalued in the age of AI. “SDH is an art, and people in the industry have no idea. They think it’s just a transcription,” says Max Deryagin, chair of Subtle, a non-profit association of freelance subtitlers and translators.The thinking is that AI should simplify the process of creating subtitles, but that is way off the mark, says Subtle committee member Meredith Cannella. “There’s an assumption that we now have to do less work because of AI tools. But I’ve been doing this now for about 14-15 years, and there hasn’t been much of a difference in how long it takes me to complete projects over the last five or six years.”“Auto transcription is the only place where I have seen some positive advancements,” Cannella adds, “but even then that doesn’t affect the total amount of time that it takes to produce an SDH file.” So many corrections are needed that there’s no net benefit compared to using older software.View image in fullscreen‘You can’t overwhelm the viewer’ … an open caption screening of  Barbie for an audience of deaf and hard of hearing people in Westwood, California, in 2023.Photograph: Allen J Schaben/Los Angeles Times/Getty ImagesMoreover the quality of AI-generated SDH is so poor that much work is needed to bring them up to standard – but because human subtitlers are often assigned tasks as “quality control”, payment is minimal. Subtle notes that many of its members are now unable to make a living wage.“SDH rates are not great to start with, but now they’re so low that it’s not even worth taking the work,” says Rachel Jones, audiovisual translator and member of the Subtle committee. “It really undermines the role that we play.”And it’s a vital role. Teri Devine, associate director of inclusion at the Royal National Institute for Deaf People, says: “For people who are deaf or have hearing loss, subtitles are an essential service – allowing them to enjoy film and TV with loved ones and stay connected to popular culture.”The same sound can mean a million different things. As humans, we interpret how it’s supposed to feelThe deaf and hard-of-hearing community is not monolithic, which means subtitlers are juggling a variety of needs in SDH creation. Jones says: “Some people might say that having the name of a song subtitled is completely useless, because it tells them nothing. But others might have a memory of how the song went, and they’ll be able to connect to it through the song’s title. Some people think that emotional cues get in the way and tell them how to feel rather than being objective. Others want them.”Subtitling involves much creative and emotionally driven decision-making, two things that AI does not currently have the capacity for. When Jones first watches a show, she writes down how the sounds make her feel, then works out how to transfer her reactions into words. Next, she determines which sounds need to be subtitled and which are excessive. “You can’t overwhelm the viewer,” she says. It is a delicate balance. “You don’t want to describe something that would be clear to the audience,” Cannella says, “and sometimes, what’s going on on the screen is much more important than the audio. The gentle music might not matter!”View image in fullscreen‘An algorithm can’t get anywhere near the level of professional work.’Photograph: Milan Surkala/AlamyAI is unable to decide which sounds are important. “Right now, it’s not even close,” Deryagin says. He also stresses the importance of the broader context of a film, rather than looking at isolated images or scenes. In Blow Out (1981), for example, a mysterious sound is heard. Later, that sound is heard again – and, for hearing viewers, reveals a major plot point. “SDH must instantly connect those two things, but also not say too much in the first instance, because viewers have to wonder what’s going on,” he says. “The same sound can mean a million different things. As humans, we interpret what it means and how it’s supposed to feel.”“You can’t just give an algorithm a soundtrack and say, ‘here are the sounds, figure it out’. Even if you give it metadata, it can’t get anywhere near the level of professional work. I’ve done my experiments!”Netflix shared a glimpse of its SDH processes after subtitles from Stranger Things, such as “[Eleven pants]” or “[Tentacles squelching wetly]” went viral, viaan interview with its subtitlers. The company declined to comment further on its use of AI in its subtitling. The BBC told the Guardian: “There is no use of AI for subtitles on TV,” though much of its work is outsourced to Red Bee Media, which last yearpublished a statementon its use of AI in SDH creation for Australian broadcaster Network 10.Jones says that linguists and subtitlers are not necessarily against AI – but at the moment, it’s making practitioners’ lives harder rather than easier. “In every industry, AI is being used to replace all the creative things that bring us joy instead of the boring, tedious tasks we hate doing,” she says.Explore more on these topicsFilmArtificial intelligence (AI)Deafness and hearing lossNetflixComputingHealthfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I never got Hula Hoops in my packed lunches because my Polish mum would give me cucumbers and I hadn’t seen High School Musical because we didn’t have Sky. Without those two major assets, you had to find a “thing” and mine became trying to make people laugh. I made a YouTube channel when I was 14, then eventually worked at the Edinburgh fringe when I was 18, and saw some amazing standup. I also saw some really bad standup. I thought: well, I can definitely do that!What’s been one of your all-timefavouritegigs?I did one where the average age of the audience was over 70. I decided to do some material about a vibrator and they absolutely loved it. A 92-year-old gave me some tips on the different settings.With all the prestige surrounding the Cambridge Footlights, did it meet your expectationswhen you were a member?It was definitely a mixed experience, some massive highs and some major lows which I won’t go into because this is a comedy interview. It was a huge privilege to not only be at Cambridge in the first place but also to get to practise a lot there. But a system like Footlights is at risk of producing a very samey, repetitive type of comedy, especially when the committee is dominated by white men, as it was when I was a fresher. In my second year I co-founded Stockings, a comedy society for women/non-binary performers which held workshops as well as open mics that you didn’t have to audition for to try to help create some new, less intimidating spaces and encourage different voices to participate. By the time I was on the Footlights committee, there were lots of conversations that were well overdue happening about representation and diversity there, and I hope things were changed for the better.Do you have a comedyhero?Jack Black in School of Rock is just wow. Robin Williams in Mrs Doubtfire, too. These are some funny guys!Do you have aheronot from the world of comedy?The team behind Colin the Caterpillar for their commitment to deliciousness and relentless innovation (see:Colin the Caterpillar rucksacks).Any bugbears from the world of comedy?Reviews. They can sometimes be useful in helping people decide what they might enjoy seeing but there are limitations and lots of context to them, and who writes them. If you’re a comedy goer, try to find a reviewer you share taste with, rather than just reading whatever comes out! I also recommend some less mainstream reviewers, such as Zoë Paskett and her newsletterLMAOnaise. I’d quite like for comedians to be able to review their reviewers. Obviously I’ll erase this answer if my next show gets exclusively five stars.View image in fullscreen‘I generally just try to write truthful comedy about stuff that scares or embarrasses me’ … Ania Magliano.Bestheckle?Any time a clip of mine goes viral it’s always well worth checking the comments section for the actual comedy gold. Recent highlights include “Who allows these women to speak into microphones?”, “She has a deep delusion” and “She is a bit strange I think.” I’d love to connect with these men more because I’ve never felt so seen.Can you recall a gig so bad, it’s now funny?My first ever gig was to two old men in an Arsenal-themed pub who were just trying to have a quiet pint. I did a lot of material about the concept of AirPods. Needless to say, it got absolutely nothing. The story isn’t that funny now, but it’s definitely funny that I confidently continued with a career in comedy after that.You’re on the new season ofTaskmaster. Tell me something that surprised you about the show?The first time you watch the tasks back in the live studio recording, it’s really challenging to see Alex Horne doing it with four other people. It’s like finding out he’s having four affairs behind your back … Alex, if you’re reading this, I thought what we had was special?Ania Magliano: ‘I have quite a lot of jokes about men being violent. There’s a dark undercurrent’Read moreWhat inspired yourforthcoming show,Peach Fuzz?My shows tend to reflect what’s been going on in my actual life in the past year or so. I’ve been trying to feel more connected to my body and less like a brain in a jar so there’s some stuff about that. I’m also on a journey of trying to figure out what I actually want in all areas of life. But to be fair a lot of it has come from watching videos of Sabrina Carpenter online and being fascinated by just how different we are. I generally just try to write truthful comedy about stuff that scares or embarrasses me to talk about because that is where the juice is.Do you have any regrets?I regret letting my hobbies slip. When comedy went from hobby to job, I never replaced it. But hobbies are good for the soul. I’ve just started a badminton WhatsApp group: 34 members strong and we haven’t managed to organise a game yet.What are you most excited aboutright now?I’m starting to paint again. Taskmaster made me remember how much joy I get from being creative (despite everything Greg said). When I didn’t do art GCSE, it just got dropped from my life, but it shouldn’t have been. You don’t have to be good at everything. I am going to lean into the fact that most of the paintings I start with will be shit and offensive. So I’ll probably just paint Greg.What have youlearnedfromstandup?Laughter is a nice thing. It can be easy to forget when it becomes your job, but fundamentally I think laughter can be such a connecting force (when used correctly) and help you feel like you’re not so alone in the world – both as audience and as comedian.Ania Magliano: Peach Fuzz ison tourfrom 6 FebruaryExplore more on these topicsStageComedy Q&AComedy (Stage)TaskmasterComedy (Culture)TV comedyTelevisionEdinburgh festivalfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But there are steps that can improve your life significantlyCorinne LowTue 23 Sep 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 23 Sep 2025 09.50 EDTShareIn 2017, I gave birth to my son, and also a midlife crisis. Suddenly, my two-hour commute from our home in New York City to my job as an economist at the University of Pennsylvania went from inconvenient but sustainable to the bane of my existence. And my marriage, which had seemed flawed but in a cute, work-in-progress kind of way, suddenly seemed to be falling apart at the seams. At the same time, in my academic career, rejections were stacking up, and I couldn’t shake the feeling that my male colleagues, some of whom were going up for tenure years before I was, simply had more time in their days. Nor did I feel as if I was at the top of my game in other domains, constantly observing how much nicer other people’s houses looked, how much better dressed their little bundles of joy were, how much more time they seemed to have to juggle motherhood, work, and coordinate everything therein.Perhaps the nadir of this period was when track repairs were taking place on my train line, and I spent a total of six hours commuting, only to work in my office for four. I pumped breast milk in the Amtrak bathroom, crying, because I wouldn’t make it home in time to put my son to bed. I not only felt as though I didn’t “have it all”; I felt as if I didn’t have anything. Not the successful career I wanted, not the thriving family and home life I wanted, and I wasn’t even the fun person I used to be, who travelled and laughed and enjoyed things. Most of all, I was So. Darn. Tired. All the time.It’s a refrain I’ve heard time and again from working women, who feel as if they’re constantly juggling and constantly dropping each ball, one by one. And it is not surprising. Gender roles have converged in the workplace, but not at home, leaving women playing both offence and defence. Women still do the majority of housework,regardless of whether they earn more or less than their male partners– in fact, a man who earns only 20% of the household income does about the same amount of housework as a man who earns 80%. Women in heterosexual marriages who are the primary breadwinners do almost twice as much cooking and cleaning as their male spouses. Added to that is an explosion of parenting time since the early 90s: mothers today spend twice as much time with their children as mothers a generation ago. Amid those pressures, women’s wages have plateaued and our percentage in the upper echelons of management and paygrades has stalled.For too long, women have been expected to accept unfairly labour-intensive, functionally unsustainable deals in all areas of work and life, and to somehow just make up the difference by working harder, optimising better, and, when that fails, “self-care”. But it’s not working for us – women’s happiness is measurably lower than it was 20 years ago – a figure that is even larger when considered relative to men, whose happiness has been improving. We cannot keep going in this direction. Something has to change.After my moment in the Amtrak train, I made some drastic changes. I ended my marriage, moved to Philadelphia, and traded a two-and-a-half-hour train ride for a seven-minute commute by bike. In Philly, I was able to afford enough space to have a live-in au pair, which meant having real help with my son for the first time.As an economist whose research focuses on the decisions that shape women’s lives and the economic and societal constraints they face when making them, I think the rationale for a lot of our decisions can be boiled down to a simple question: Am I getting a good deal? I don’t want to gaslight you, suggesting the problems in our lives can be solved by one simple trick or lifehack. These problems arehard. But I want to help you ask for more – from your partner, from your boss and from the system itself.How to get a good – or at least better – dealWork out your personal utility functionView image in fullscreenYou cannot compare yourself. Only you know your values and priorities.Photograph: Posed by model; Tomas Rodriguez/Getty ImagesIn the same way for-profit companies are assumed to be making choices to maximise their bottom line, economists view human beings as agents who maximise their own personal “profit” function: utility. But unlike dollars and cents that can be counted, utility is a much more amorphous concept. One way to think of utility is as your personal video game score at the end of your life. Except you decide what gives you points, because only you know your values and priorities.Importantly, you cannot compare yourself with people who don’t have the same utility function as you do. We fall into this trap all the time: you might find the greatest utility in volunteer work or travel, activities that don’t leave you with a lot of time at home. There’s absolutely nothing wrong with that. But – and this is the trap – suddenly when you visit a friend who finds great utility in homemaking, or from-scratch cooking, you start to feel as if you are failing. This is not a failure – it is a difference in utility function.Maximise subject to constraintsView image in fullscreenMost people face constraints but women – even if they never have kids – have more.Photograph: Posed by models; 10,000 Hours/Getty ImagesWhen I was one semester away from graduation, I shared with a female professor that I was hoping to pursue an economics PhD, but first, I had taken a job with McKinsey & Company. Her aghast expression surprised me. “No,” she said, “you can’t do that. Two years at McKinsey, six-year PhD, two-year postdoc, seven-year tenure track …” Then, with great urgency: “You’re never going to have kids!” At the time, I felt taken aback, and maybe even a little offended, but I also knew she was right. If I wanted to have kids, I had to think about how it all added up, in a way that men just didn’t need to consider.Most people face constraints, from financial to social to time, but women – even if they never have kids – have more. Just as we can’t compare ourselves to people who don’t have the same utility function, you must not compare yourself to people who don’t face the same constraints. We may all be in the same game, but some of us have more protective equipment.Worklike agirlView image in fullscreenStop telling women they need to change the way they approach work.Photograph: Posed by models; Luis Alvarez/Getty ImagesSure, there are tips I give my students. Say, “Thank you for helping”, instead of apologising for a problem beyond your control. Learn to take up space – look at men who ask questions in class, and see how comfortable they are taking up other people’s time to get their own needs met. We can all fine-tune our communication skills. But I want you to separate this from a need to change who you are.There is a canonical paper written by two experimental economists, Muriel Niederle and Lise Vesterlund, titled “Do Women Shy Away from Competition? Do Men Compete Too Much?” and the authors have told me people always forget about that second part (the answer is yes; 60% of low-performing men choose a competition they’re destined to lose over a certain payout). Why don’t we spend as much time speculating that male over-competitiveness might be destroying corporate value as we do asking women to change, to be more cut-throat, to lean in? I think aboutChristine Lagarde’s suggestion, that if it was “Lehman Sisters instead of Lehman Brothers”, perhaps there wouldn’t have been so much over-indexing on high-risk mortgage securities, and the financial crisis wouldn’t have been as bad.Women are often also described as bad negotiators, but my own research has found that men are more thantwice as likely to fail to reach an agreement, and therefore walk away from a negotiation with nothing. What holds women back is lacking assurance they won’t be penalised for it, not the skillorthe will. So let’s get out of the mindset of telling women they need to change the way they approach work and start talking about the unique value they bring to the table.Getmorethanyougive atworkView image in fullscreenYour employer will never love you back.Photograph: MoMo Productions/Getty ImagesAt every stage I want you to think about the balance of trade between you and your employer: how much are you giving, and how much are you getting? In a world where harassment, discrimination and microaggressions often stop women from earning as much as men, what can you do to ensure you are getting more than you give? Even if you love your job, or at least some people there, remember that your employer will never love you back. Their objective is to maximise profit. Yours is to maximise your own utility. Your interests may overlap at times, but, fundamentally, they are not shared.And, very importantly, understand the difference between a job and a passion project.Invest in the right partnerView image in fullscreenThink about who is going to make a good partnerin the enterprise of running a household.Photograph: Posed by models; sturti/Getty ImagesTrust me, I know that “the heart wants what it wants.” But having feelings for someone is what economists call a “necessary but not sufficient condition”. As in – it’s necessary for a relationship to be successful. But it isn’t enough.I want you to go into the process of choosing a significant other armed not just with your innate sense of who you’re attracted to, but also the savviness to think about who is going to make a goodpartnerin the enterprise of running a household and the other things you need to weather.Wearing my economist’s hat, I often think about dating as a job interview. So even in those heady early days when all you want to do is talk about your favourite bands and movies, or moral philosophy, or whatever your jam is, I urge women to also ask tactical questions such as: “Who does your laundry?”, “What do you like to cook for dinner?” After all, when interviewing someone for a job, you wouldn’t just ask about their opinions – you would ask about their experience, preparation and demonstrated track record.Make a relationship performance-improvement planView image in fullscreenIf the joint load is falling on your shoulders, reset the terms of your relationship.Photograph: Posed by models; Morsa Images/Getty ImagesJust like we shouldn’t settle for a partner, we shouldn’t settle for a “deal” with the partner we’ve already chosen that leaves us exhausted and depleted. In that spirit, if you’re finding that the joint load is falling on your shoulders, and love is fizzling, you need to have tough conversations and reset the terms of your relationship. I’m going to focus here mostly on an unequal division of home production, because this is so often the challenge that I see driving relationships with two reasonable people, that were once filled with love, into the ground.Get two sheets of graph paper, or open up a Google spreadsheet, and write out seven days with 15-minute intervals from the earliest time you could possibly wake up to the latest you go to bed. If you have a baby who wakes up at night, you’ll need slots for the overnight, too. Then, for one week, fill out what you do in each of those 15-minute slots. You both have to do it for this to work! If you’re multitasking and taking care of someone else and yourself, write that, too – “Did my hair while getting kiddo dressed.” And remember, for these purposes, even if you enjoy packing your child’s lunch every day, it’s childcare.Household management is a big one – use that category any time you’re thinking or emailing or calling or researching online about something household-related. Your partner might be shocked – and you might be, too – at how little time you actually have for work, for personal care, for social connection, for exercise. For enjoying all the other things that make up parts of your utility function.Create specialisation in your relationshipView image in fullscreenMen have been weaponising incompetence for decades, and it’s high time we got hip to it.Photograph: Posed by models; Halfpoint Images/Getty ImagesThen it’s time to look at the data. Who is actually spending more time on which tasks? Are there any areas that surprise you? You might find that some of the places you’re overburdened are those where both people agree something needs to be done but don’t agree on how much work it should require. Others might be tasks that your partner didn’t even realise existed – like the fact that the kids’ summer camp schedule doesn’t magically materialise but rather takes hours of researching, calling and paperwork.Now it’s time to begin reallocating the workload. But where to start? I’m partial to Eve Rodsky’s Fair Playmethod of divvying up tasks wholesale – like dealing out a deck of cards (you can actually buy the cards to do it online). The reason I think it works is that if you assign someone part of a task, you still end up with the “household management” piece of it – conceptualising what needs to be done, managing it, monitoring progress. The women I know who are happiest in their marriages are those who say: “Oh, I don’t cook at all.” Men have been weaponising incompetence for decades, and it’s high time we got hip to it.Will this need readjustment and renegotiation? Definitely. But is it better than you trying to do everything, being exhausted, and resenting your family instead of spending quality time with them? Also yes.Pay yourself first, with timeView image in fullscreenLeisure time must be treated as a sacred obligation, instead of the ‘treat’ you’re allowed to have if you get through your entire to-do list.Photograph: Posed by models; skynesher/Getty Images“Pay yourself first”is a personal finance adage that refers to putting money into savings or investments before you do the rest of your budgeting. The idea is that by taking the liquid cash out immediately, and putting it toward long-term goals, you reel in some of the behavioural forces that sometimes cause us to make “mistakes” that run counter to our long-term interests.Leisure time must be accounted for in advance and treated as a sacred obligation, just like a meeting with your boss, instead of the “treat” you’re allowed to have if you get through your entire to-do list. Because the to-do list will always be there, but time will not. Surprisingly, planning for this time can make you feel as if you have more time, instead of less.OutsourceView image in fullscreenSociety is much more comfortable in outsourcing male-coded tasks than female-coded tasks.Photograph: Posed by model; Guido Mieth/Getty ImagesI’d like to note how much more comfortable society is in outsourcing male-coded tasksthan female-coded tasks. Hiring a handyman to clean the gutters, or painters to touch up the house is considered a norm, because we assume thatmen’stime can be valuably spent earning money on the market instead of insourcing home production. But when it comes to female-coded tasks such as cooking, cleaning, and childcare, we suddenly feel as if the budget to hire someone is an unaffordable luxury rather than a basic requirement.So take a truly comprehensive view of the cost of insourcing a task – of hiring yourself for it – which includes the time, the cost of materials, the stress of doing it, and take a hard look at whether investing that time in your career or just in your sanity would have payoffs beyond the cost of something that feels a little out of reach.If paying to outsource labour isn’t an option for you, can you trade tasks with friends, create car pools, or just invest in simplifying your life so certain things don’t need to happen?You need to be ruthless. I think of it as Marie Kondo, but for time.Convert time into joy and meaningView image in fullscreenWe cannot keep meeting everyone else’s needs and putting ourselves last.Photograph: 10’000 Hours/Getty ImagesIn choosing how we want to spend our time, we have to get used to listening to a different part of ourselves – the constant, omnipresent part who will be with us through our entire lives – rather than the temporary flares of chemicals and emotions (guilt, flattery, unhelpful social norms, algorithms) that create internal chatter. I want you to practise turning up the volume on your inner truths about what you are seeking in life and turning down the volume on the other forces pulling you away from that.With so many demands on us, it is all too easy for women to forget that we are the protagonists of our own lives. We cannot keep meeting everyone else’s needs and putting ourselves last. It’s time to start writing our own stories.This is an edited extract from Femonomics: What Data Tells Us About Women’s Lives and How to Get the Most Out of Yours, which is published by Hodder Press (£22) on 25 September.

Are any actually worth saving?With many classic puddings on the verge of dying out, I set out to discover which should be back on the menu. It was a journey through some of the heaviest desserts in historyTim DowlingTue 23 Sep 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 23 Sep 2025 11.10 EDTShareBritain’s puddings are under threat. According toresearch from English Heritage, only 2% of British households eat a daily homemade dessert, while a third never bake, boil or steam one at all.“Sweet puddings are closely intertwined with British history and it would be a huge shame for them to die out,” said the charity’s senior curator of history, Dr Andrew Hann. But he went on to suggest that, at the current rate of decline, the British pudding will be extinct in 50 years.View image in fullscreenNo history, no nostalgia … American Tim Dowling prepares to steam a sponge.Photograph: Alicia Canter/The GuardianLeaving aside complex questions about what does and doesn’t constitute a British pudding – we know an apple crumble is one, and a Calippo isn’t – we must ask ourselves why we’ve stopped producing old-fashioned cooked desserts. Do we lack the time, or the skill – or both? Have tastes changed? Have certain classic puddings simply faded from Britain’s collective memory?I can’t answer that last one – I’m American. I’ve been exposed to many British puddings over the years, but I have no history with them, or nostalgia for them. To remedy this, I tried cooking 10 of Britain’s endangered puddings, in an attempt to find out which, if any, are worthy of a rescue effort, and which may deserve their approaching extinction.Jam roly-polyView image in fullscreenTim’s slightly raw jam roly-poly.Photograph: Tim Dowling/The GuardianI’ve never eaten a jam roly-poly, AKA shirt-sleeve pudding, AKA dead man’s arm. My adult British children reckon they have had it for school dinners, but they were as surprised as I was by the recipe, especially the generous amount of beef suet. Suet, the fat around the kidneys of the animal, is commonly available in a fairly inoffensive, pelleted form. There is a vegetable version, but I stuck with the original.I watched chef Aaron Middleton’s video tutorial, because I figured there would be some technique to master, but the dough itself is basic: self-raising flour, butter, suet, sugar, milk. Once it comes together, you flatten it into a large rectangle, slather the whole thing in raspberry jam, roll it up and pinch the ends.View image in fullscreenShredded beef suet.Photograph: Alicia Canter/The GuardianThis assembly is then wrapped in a parcel of greaseproof paper and foil, and steamed in the oven, with a roasting tin full of boiling water sitting on the rack below.The most generous thing I could say about my first jam roly-poly is that it let me down: it didn’t rise; it didn’t form a crust; it didn’t, to be honest, come out of the oven looking materially different from when I put it in. If I were being less generous, I would also add that it was disgusting – claggy, sickly sweet and still raw in places. Something went wrong, and I’m not sure what. I forced a slice on my middle son and dared him to be complimentary.“You can really taste the suet,” he said.Rating (1 being the least palatable/hardest to make, and 5 the nicest/easiest): taste: 1; ease: 1Sussex pond puddingView image in fullscreenInferior to an actual apple … Tim’s Sussex pond pudding.Photograph: Alicia Canter/The GuardianI followed Mary Berry’s recipe for this timeless British pudding that I’ve never heard of; you have to wonder if the name isn’t a big part of the problem. Sussex pond pudding is made with apples, muscovado sugar and, yes, more suet. It also has a whole lemon at its heart, which I guess you’re supposed to cut around when you serve it. But we’re getting ahead of ourselves.It employs a similar dough to the one for the jam roly-poly that failed me so badly, though perhaps this one is a little drier. The apples are peeled, cored, diced into cubes and mixed with cold butter and sugar. You also need a pudding basin of about 1.5 litres capacity, or around 20cm diameter across the top.The basin is thoroughly buttered, the dough rolled out into a 30cm circle. Slice out one quarter of it – from noon to 3pm, say – and reserve. The remainder should fit snugly into the contours of your pudding bowl. Spoon a bit of the apple, butter and sugar mixture into the bottom of the pastry lining. Pierce the lemon all over with a fork or cocktail stick and sit it upright in the mixture. Surround that with more apples, and then turn your reserved dough into a circular lid.View image in fullscreenA dog’s dinner? Tim and his pudding.Photograph: Alicia Canter/The GuardianI had to watch a video of a guy sealing and tying his pudding bowl for steaming several times – it’s complicated – but you fashion a covering from a layer of greaseproof paper and one of foil, with a pleat down the middle for expansion. Then, you tie string tightly round the edge (pudding basins have a pronounced lip for this purpose), create a handle from more string, and trim off the excess foil. The resulting parcel is pretty impressive – if only one was allowed to stop there.This package goes into a big pan with a tight-fitting lid, with boiling water poured halfway up the sides of the bowl. Simmer with the lid on for – get this –three-and-a-half hours, topping up the water as needed.As soon as it’s cool enough, invert over a plate; you should end up with a crusty dome surrounding an apple pie filling. And a lemon.I used to think I understood what the word stodgy meant in a culinary context, but the Sussex pond pudding has reset my frame of reference. This is, by some measure, the heaviest dessert I’ve ever made, and while it’s not terrible, I can’t think of anything to recommend it over a hundred other apple-based foodstuffs, including an apple.Taste: 2; ease: 2Bread and butter puddingView image in fullscreenTim’s bread and butter pudding.Photograph: Tim Dowling/The GuardianBesides suet, the other big ingredient you’ll find in endangered British puddings is old bread – the older the better. Many pudding recipes even offer tips for ageing bread which is insufficiently past it.I’ve tasted – and, with certain reservations, enjoyed – bread and butter pudding in the past, but I’ve never made my own. I hadn’t quite realised the extent to which it is simply breakfast in another form – toast, butter, eggs, milk – with a few sultanas scattered over the top. As classic puddings go, it’s refreshingly foolproof – just layer everything into a deep dish, like a lasagne, and bake until set. My family ate this without complaint and, although I’ve always found it disconcerting that actual slices of bread are left sticking up out of it – like the sardine heads poking out of a stargazy pie – I would hate to see it become extinct for that reason.Taste: 3; ease: 3Queen of puddingsView image in fullscreenTim holds his queen of puddings.Photograph: Alicia Canter/The GuardianTo be on the safe side, I chose a recipe by the queen of puddings herself, Delia Smith. This is another old bread dessert, requiring fresh (ie stale) white breadcrumbs soaked in hot milk, combined with sugar, egg yolks, butter and lemon zest. The result is baked in an ovenproof dish until it takes on a weird rubbery texture. Then you spread melted jam over the top, layer stiff egg whites on top of the jam, and bake for another 10 to 15 minutes until the meringue peaks are nicely singed.This was a wholly surprising success – elegant and even a little decadent, although I only had a taste before my wife took the whole thing to a dinner party I wasn’t invited to, and came back with an empty dish. In the circumstances, full marks.Taste: 5; ease: 4Treacle sponge puddingView image in fullscreenShabby stuff … Tim’s treacle sponge pudding.Photograph: Tim Dowling/The GuardianI’m relieved to discover that this contains neither suet or old bread. According to Delia, it’s a sponge batter with a bit of black treacle in the mix, poured into a pudding basin that already has a generous puddle of golden syrup in the bottom, and steamed for two hours. When it’s turned out, the syrup should run down through it in the time-honoured fashion.My first ever attempt was a little shabby in appearance – some of the sponge clung to the bowl, and I missed the middle of the plate when turning it out – but it was absolutely delicious when accompanied by custard, double cream, clotted cream or, in my case, an unholy combination of the three.Taste: 5; ease: 4FlummeryView image in fullscreenTim adds whipped cream to his flummery.Photograph: Alicia Canter/The GuardianAn ancient, jelly-like dessert, flummery is traditionally thickened with the starch that comes from oatmeal soaked in water. This presents two problems from the modern cook’s perspective: first, a full 48 hours of soaking is required before the oatmeal is discarded and the starchy water preserved; and second, even that will not be enough.“So the flummery refuses to thicken,” is a phrase that could easily come from a 17th-century book of aphorisms. But that’s what happened to me. I stirred the mixture of cloudy oat water, orange juice and sugar for nearly half an hour, and still it doth refuse.View image in fullscreenTim and his son give his flummery a whirl.Photograph: Alicia Canter/The GuardianThe recipe I consulted says that if your flummery is reluctant to thicken you can add a bit of cornflour, which is another way of saying “warning: this recipe may not work”. A bit of cornflour, I decided, equates to about half a teaspoon. When that achieved nothing, I added another half teaspoon, and another, and another. By that point I was thinking: even if this works, it’s no longer a true flummery.Suddenly, almost an hour after I started stirring, the mixture turned to glue. I beat in some cream and put it in the fridge, as instructed, to set even further. The recipe is meant to yield six dessert glasses of flummery. My version stretched to exactly one.However, once I’d added a thin layer of honey mixed with whisky, and a thick layer of piped whipped cream dusted with orange zest, the dessert started looking the part. It even tasted good, although of the three layers, the bottom one – the flummery itself – was my least favourite.Taste: 3; ease: 1SpotteddickView image in fullscreenDull and dry … Tim’s spotted dick in progress.Photograph: Alicia Canter/The GuardianThis is the last of the suet puddings on the list, and ideally the last one I will ever make. I am getting very good at trussing up puddings for steaming, but progressively less good at eating them – I’m beginning to lose heart.This is essentially the same old basic suet dough, this time studded with currants, a sort of miser’s raisin. Curiously, James Martin’s recipe leaves out the protective foil layer for steaming – he uses greaseproof paper with a tea towel over the top instead. It sounds risky, but I follow his instructions because I’m not in a position to know if it makes a difference.The result, however, looks perfect, and tastes exactly as I guessed it would: dry and dull. It’s much better with custard, but not as good as custard on its own.Taste: 2; ease: 4Malvern puddingView image in fullscreenTim’s Malvern pudding.Photograph: Tim Dowling/The GuardianThis one is simple – apples in custard, with a demerara sugar and cinnamon crust on top, like a Worcestershire creme brulee. The Hairy Bikers’ recipe relies on what is essentially a creme patissiere; but if you can nail that part the rest is easy, as well as tasty. It’s also the only one of the 10 puddings here that you could conceivably produce on a whim. Malvern pudding came eighth in a list of the10 most threatened British puddingsback in 2006 (calf’s foot jelly came top), but on this showing it deserves reassessment.Taste: 5; ease: 4Cabinet puddingView image in fullscreenBegging for cream … Tim’s cabinet pudding.Photograph: Alicia Canter/The GuardianThe historical version of cabinet pudding – or chancellor’s pudding – seems to be another old bread recipe, but the version I made is a fairly ordinary kind of sponge. The gimmicks are the mixed peel added to the dough and the halved glace cherries decorating the sides. You must add the dough a bit at a time, to support each fresh row of cherries along the wall of the basin, otherwise they’ll slip off. It needs to steam for an hour and a half, which in the world of traditional British puddings is a blink of an eye.I like this one – it looks very impressive, for comparatively little effort, and, like almost all these puddings, it begs to be drowned in custard or cream or both. If you were the chancellor you may feel you deserved more, but I was happy enough.Taste: 3; ease: 4Rice puddingView image in fullscreenTim’s rice pudding.Photograph: Tim Dowling/The GuardianA confession: I have a longstanding aversion to rice pudding. I can’t call it dislike, because I’ve never actually let any pass my lips. But it doesn’t rise to the level of a phobia either; just a lifetime of saying, “None for me, thanks.”I trust the food writer Simon Hopkinson in all things, but I’m taking his word for it in this case, since I don’t know what rice pudding is supposed to taste like. He starts his rice pudding on the hob: melting butter, coating the pudding rice (not that easy to come by, but it’s basically paella rice), and stirring in sugar until the rice is swollen and sticky. Add milk – a whole litre – some cream, vanilla and a grating of nutmeg over the top. Bake for between an hour and 90 minutes, depending.I’m assured by my wife, who likes rice pudding, that this is a very good version. Having tried it for the first time, I can return to my aversion with confidence. At this point, I quite fancy a Calippo.Taste: 3.5; ease: 5View image in fullscreenNo tears shed … collateral from the spotted dick.Photograph: Alicia Canter/The GuardianOf all the puddings tested, I would say that Malvern pudding is most worthy of rehabilitation, and simultaneously the most in need of it. And while I would shed no tears if either spotted dick or Sussex pond pudding became extinct tomorrow, jam roly-poly is one pudding I’d be happy to terminate with extreme prejudice.Which puddings would you keep, and which would you bin?

Is he right to be furious?We recently began exploring group sex. But he insists I crossed a line one morning, and is punishing me with silence and distancePamela Stephenson ConnollyTue 23 Sep 2025 08.12 EDTLast modified on Tue 23 Sep 2025 09.04 EDTShareMy husband and I are in an open relationship (both male, married for eight years) and on a recent holiday westarted to explore group sex. We had a wonderful threesome where we both felt great afterwards and had a mutual attraction to the other man– which israre for us. However, our latest endeavour wasn’t as successful.We invited a couple and a single man back to our hotel room. Everything was great during the fivesome,and afterwards the couple left. We invited the other man to stay the night (mostly led by me).In the morning, things between me and thisman started to heat up. He went to the bathroom and I asked my husband if he wanted to partake, to which he said no and that he’d rather sleep. Regardless, I carried on withthe man for a short period until we climaxed.After he left, my husband was extremely mad at me. It wasn’t a boundary we had discussed, and I’ve apologised. However, part of me feels likeit isn’t as bad as he’s making me feel. He haspunished me with silence, distance and an expectation of pandering from me throughout. I also feel like he’s using it as an excuse for his own bad behaviour of concealing communication with other men. Our agreement is to be upfront and honest about everything we get up to, buthe has a history ofhiding and erasing sext messages,and in general is quite closed off with his feelings.Am I morally in the wrong here? Andis there hope for us in the relationship?I cannot be a morality judge, but what I can say is that any open relationship requires a great deal of frankness, negotiation and respect for each other’s feelings. Clearly, as often happens with couples, there is a discrepancy between your understanding of what was acceptable during group sex and your husband’s. The finer points really need to be discussed in great detail as soon as possible.But even if a couple discuss all kinds of scenarios they think might occur, it is still easy to be taken by surprise by new situations and feelings that arise unexpectedly and create turmoil. You seem to have good insight, and have now learned that for your husband, each new situation requires that you check in with him.People who are alexithymic (who find it hard to express emotion) have great difficulty letting others know when they are uncomfortable about something, and may require prompting. In the heat of the moment it can be easy to forget this, but he has made it clear that it’s important to him. If you wish to continue including other people for sexual fun with relative emotional safety, stay in touch with your intuition and err on the side of caution.Pamela Stephenson Connolly is a US-based psychotherapist who specialises in treating sexual disorders.If you would like advice from Pamela on sexual matters, send us a brief description of your concerns toprivate.lives@theguardian.com(please don’t send attachments).

I found this was in response to a government-issued“requirement towarn” notice.Since then Candy has made and cancelled four appointments to fix it. Customer services insiststhereare no available engineers and that only the “planning team”, whichis apparentlyuncontactableby them or me, can book new appointments.AW,Stamford, LincolnshireYou have not just been left with an unusable £529 machine, which you say is essential, as you have young children and limited space; you’ve been living for two years with a potentially lethal hazard. So have thousands of others.Candy, which is part of the Chinese multinational Haier group, identified what it called “manufacturing variations” that could result in certain brands of built-in heat pump dryers short-circuiting and catching fire. Technicians were dispatched to modify all affected machines. So far so alarming. It seems the repairs may have been botched.In August, the government’s Office for Product Safety and Standards said the modification programme was “not satisfactory”; that the tumble dryers were “dangerous”; and ordered Haier to contact customers urgently to tell them to stop using their appliance and disconnect it. Failure to act on a requirement to warn could lead to a fine or imprisonment for the manufacturer’s bosses.So unsatisfactory were the repairs that it was feared the dryer could catch fire even while idle if plugged in.About 17,000 tumble dryers are affected, including Baumatic, Caple, Haier, Hoover, Lamona, Iberna and Montpellier brands.Judging by your experience, Haier is remarkably cavalier about the impact of its failings. Having cancelled the fourth appointment it went to ground and only resurfaced when I gave it a prod.It told me it sent its “sincere apologies for the inconvenience” and congratulated itself on its “ongoing commitment to product safety”.This miraculously unearthed a technician who attended with a few hours’ notice. Thousands more are probably still waiting. All Haier will say is that it aims to get round to everyone by “the earliest possible date”. Fingers crossed it has got the fix right this time round.We welcome letters but cannot answer individually.

Ride bikes. Wild camp.” I’m in Perthshire on a three-day bikepacking trip – cycling with all my gear – and this is my itinerary for the day. For an endlessly calendar-checking parent of three, the simplicity of this schedule is almost dizzying. I feel like a child with my summer holiday stretching out ahead of me.Comrie Croft Journeysis a new initiative from eco-camping and mountain-biking destinationComrie Croft, started by experienced mountain bike instructor Emily Greaves. The off-grid cycling adventures aim to immerse visitors in Scotland’s wild landscapes while providing everything they need, from food to equipment. Guests can choose to be self-guided or led – and I’m heading out with Emily to explore on a mountain bike for the first time in my adult life.Scotland biking mapThe croft is set across quiet woodland and bucolic meadows and I arrive early to explore the onsite organic market gardenTomnah’aand enjoy a hearty mixed grain bowl with roast root vegetables and local Wee Comrie cheese atGorse cafe. I’ve driven here, but for the ultimate emission-avoiding trip, it’s possible to get the train to Gleneagles from Edinburgh or London, then be picked up in the Croft’s electric car.Before we hit the trails, Emily puts me through my paces with a mountain-biking lesson on the gravel pump track. We’re cycling for three days and everything we need – clothes, food, camping stove, tent, sleeping bags and mat – has to be strapped to our bikes. Beside me a French family is getting set up for a self-guided adventure. Emily has planned their route, pre-loaded on a GPX device with detailed trip notes, and prepped their bikes and equipment. I thought I’d packed light, but most of my clothes are soon in a discard pile. “You need clothes to cycle in, warm layers to sleep in, and waterproofs – that’s it,” Emily says.View image in fullscreenAilsa, right, with her guide Emily.Photograph: Ailsa SheldonFully laden we head off, uphill through ancient woodland and the pretty village of Comrie, then on to rough farm tracks heading into the hills. Tonight’s destination is a youth hostel, a last-minute change due to thundery weather. Bikepacking doesn’t always have to mean camping – many long-distance cyclists combine camping with stays at hostels and even hotels. It’s about enjoyment, not endurance, or “smiles not miles”, as Emily puts it.Today’s ride is 20 miles (32km), taking in 520 metres of ascent. It’s an intentionally gentle start, but for me still pretty challenging, as I get to grips with my cycling position, descending on loose gravel, and learning to trust the bike. We pass through fields of sheep, splash through little streams, slowly gaining height over the lower slopes of Carn Labhruinn and Meall Odhar. By the time we descend towards Callander, the clouds darken, obscuring the mountain tops, and heavy rain soaks in the seams of my jacket: I’m delighted not to be putting up a tent. AtCallander Hostel, run by a local social enterprise, we stay in a cosy pod in the garden (from £81), dry our soggy clothes, and sleep deeply.I’m getting to love the calf-burning push of a long uphill and the thrill of the downhill tooDay two is our longest in the saddle, with 44 miles to cover. Emily, sensibly, doesn’t tell me the ascent until later (it’s 1,020 metres). We set out in high spirits, fuelled by egg and haggis rolls fromMhor Breadin Callander.We’re riding through Loch Lomond and the Trossachs national park, an area I’ve often driven through but never stopped to fully appreciate – I’ve been missing out. With mountains aplenty, peaceful lochs and glens, and a well-connected network of paths and trails, there’s so much to explore. Emily’s well-designed route takes us along some quiet single-track roads, but is mostly off-road, on gravel tracks through heathery glens, forestry plantations and native woodland, and on winding lochside paths through the bracken.View image in fullscreenThe routes take in glorious open countryside.Photograph: Pete ScullionWe pedal along the quiet side of Loch Venachar before joining the Three Lochs Forest Drive, a rough track that links Loch Drunkie, Lochan Reòidhte, and Loch Achray. It’s hilly, but I’m getting to love the calf-burning push of a long uphill, and the thrill of the downhill too. At Aberfoyle, we stop atLiz MacGregors coffee shopfor lemon drizzle cake. “You have to keep your energy up,” Emily says. She has completed many long-distance cycles, including the epicHighland Trail 550, often named one of Scotland’s toughest off-road cycling races. If she says it’s time to eat cake, I’m only too happy to agree.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe TravellerFree newsletterGet travel inspiration, featured trips and local tips for your next break, as well as the latest deals from Guardian HolidaysEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It’s tempting, but given steamships have been running on Loch Katrine for over 180 years, it seems safe to leave it for another day. Today is all about the bikes, and I don’t want to miss a moment. Later we pitch tents by the shores of Loch Achray, with just a slight dance with the midges until the breeze returns. We collect water, heat up instant meals on our camp stoves, and drink in the views of Ben A’an and Ben Venue.View image in fullscreenLuxury accommodation and the Nowhere Sauna await at the end of the ride.Photograph: Seth TinsleyIn the morning, the loch shimmers silver in the pale sunlight and Emily and I wade in for a beautifully refreshing swim, then warm up with bowls of porridge. The last day of cycling has come round all too soon, and it’s 37 miles back to Comrie, with a lunch stop atMhor 84in Balquhidder. The last stretch takes in Glen Finglas estate singletrack, a popular local cycling route along an undulating ridge. I’m loving feeling the power in my legs.Back at Comrie Croft we’ve reserved seats atNowhere Sauna(from £16), one of the 12 micro-businesses that operate at the croft. Tucked into a quiet corner of woodland, it’s the perfect place to stretch and relax, interspersed with refreshing dunks in the icy tin bath. From here, it’s a short walk uphill for a decidedly more luxurious evening, at the croft’s newly openedcabin. Joining the site’scamping pitches,Nordic katas(conical, tipi-like tents) and itseco-lodge hostel, the handbuilt wooden cabin is a beautiful hideaway for two adults (plus a child or two on a convertible sofa, if you must). With a wood-burning stove, full kitchen, mezzanine bedroom and big private deck, it’s likely to be popular with onsite weddings and honeymooners. Tonight it’s all mine, and even better, local deliHansen’s Kitchenhas dropped me off supper, including local beers and a lasagne made with vegetables from the market garden. I sit out on the deck until the first stars appear, resting my tired legs and soaking in the scenery, reflecting on an incredible few days.The cycling trip and accommodation were provided byComrie CroftandComrie Croft Journeys.

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.The Pixel 10 Pro XL is the largest slab phone Google makes and is one of the biggest available in Europe and the US. It costs £1,199 (€1,299/$1,199/A$1,999), sitting above itssmaller sibling the Pixel 10 Proand below the upcoming folding Pixel 10 Pro Fold, and competing directly with Apple’s iPhone 17 Pro Max andSamsung’s Galaxy S25 Ultra.The 10 Pro XL is almost identical on the outside tothe 9 Pro XLit replaces in terms of dimensions but with 11g of additional weight. It is a big, heavy phone that requires two hands to use most of the time and benefits from a phone grip or handle.View image in fullscreenThe Pixel has a ring of magnets to attach any number of Qi2 or MagSafe accessories to the back including phone grips, such as the Popsocket, as well as car mounts, wallets, stands and batteries.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianIt has a huge, bright and smooth OLED screen, which is one of the very best and excellent for watching TV and films. The back hides Qi2.2 wireless charging and magnetic accessory support, making it one of a very small number of phones that can charge at up to 25W using a new generation of wireless chargers.The 10 Pro XL has the same Google Tensor G5 chip as the rest of thePixel 10lineup andperforms just as well, feeling rapid in general use. It plays games just fine, but those wanting the best graphics and frame rates in high-end mobile games are better served by rivals with Qualcomm’s top Snapdragon chip, such as the S25 Ultra.The biggestPixelalso has the largest battery with the longest run time. The 10 Pro XL matches its predecessor, lasting about 52 hours between charges after a mix of usage across wifi and 5G. The phone should outlast even the heaviest of usage days, with most people probably needing to charge it every other day.View image in fullscreenThe phone takes less than 90 minutes to charge via cable or about two hours using a Qi2 25W wireless charger, such as theUgreen MagFlow 2-in-1(left) orBelkin UltraCharge Pro(right).Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianSpecificationsScreen:6.8in 120Hz QHD+ OLED (486ppi)Processor:Google Tensor G5RAM:16GBStorage:256, 512GB or 1TBOperating system:Android16Camera:50MP + 48MP UW + 48MP 5x tele; 42MP selfieConnectivity:5G, eSIM, wifi 7, UWB, NFC, Bluetooth 6 and GNSSWater resistance:IP68 (1.5m for 30 minutes)Dimensions:162.8 x 76.6 x 8.5mmWeight:232gAndroid 16 with AIView image in fullscreenMagic Cue is one of the most advanced AI features available, working silently in the background to produce helpful and timely information.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe 10 Pro XL has the same Android 16 software and AI features asthe 10 Pro, making it one of the most expressive and polished experiences available. Google will provide updatesuntil 2032.The Gemini chatbot is available throughout the system, and has its own stand-alone app that can see what is on your screen or through the camera to help. But the standout new feature is Magic Cue, which runs locally in the background as a proactive little helper presenting data from your calendar, emails, chats and other Google apps on your phone when you need it. It will pop up with the location of a restaurant when a friend texts about your dinner date or shows your order emails in the phone app when you ring a recognised business. It works great in Google’s various apps, and a handful of third-party ones, but not WhatsApp or other popular messaging apps yet.The 10 Pro XL also comes with a year’s subscription forGoogle AI Pro, for access to the company’s more powerful Gemini models, and 2TB of cloud storage for photos, files and email, worth £19 a month.CameraView image in fullscreenPoint and shoot with the 10 Pro XL and you are almost guaranteed a great shot regardless of the conditionsPhotograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe big Pixel has thesame camera system as the 10 Pro, meaning your choice is only about phone size not camera quality. The 50-megapixel main, 48MP ultra wide and 48MP 5x telephoto cameras are some of the very best you can get. Point and shoot with the 10 Pro XL and you are almost guaranteed a great shot regardless of the conditions.It also has a handful of helpful AI tools including: thenovel Camera Coach;Add Me, which blends two photos to put the photographer into group shots; andBest Take, which has now been made automatic. It helps get group shots where everyone is looking at the camera by shooting a photo when everyone is looking once you press the shutter button or blending multiple shots where needed.Finally, it has the Pro Res Zoom feature that kicks in when you push beyond 30x magnification and uses genAI to put the detail and sharpness back into images lost to digital zoom. It isn’t always perfect and is switched off when the system detects a person, but it can have remarkable results, making blurry 100x zoom images much clearer and more usable. But it is also not a true photo at that point, as it has been interpreted and remade by AI, and is labelled as such by the camera app usingC2PA content credentials.Overall, whether you use the AI tools or not, the Pixel has one of the very best camera systems on the market.SustainabilityView image in fullscreenThe ultrasonic fingerprint scanner under the screen is super fast and accurate, making unlocking the phone a breeze.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe batteryis rated to lastin excess of 1,000 full charge cycles with at least 80% of its original capacity. The phone is repairable by Google, third-party shops, or self-repair usingmanualsandparts available.The Pixel 10 Pro XL contains 29% recycled materials by weight including aluminium, cobalt, copper, glass, gold, plastic, rare-earth elements, tungsten and tin. The company breaks down thephone’s environmental impactin its report and willrecycle old devicesfor free.PriceThe Google Pixel 10 Pro XL costs from£1,199(€1,299/$1,199/A$1,999) in a choice of four colours.For comparison, thePixel 10costs from£799, thePixel 10 Profrom£999, thePixel 9acosts£399, theGalaxy S25 Ultracosts£1,249and the iPhone 17 Pro Max costs£1,199.VerdictThe Pixel 10 Pro XL is a true superphone in size, price and capability. If you like what Google’s beendoingwith 6.3insmartphonesbut want everything bigger, this is the model to get.The camera is one of the very best, the screen is great and the software, including Google’s most cutting-edge AI features, is top notch. The addition of Qi2.2 support speeds up wireless charging, but more helpfully opens up a world of magnetic accessories including grips to make the big phone easier to hold.The Pixel feels responsive but it isn’t a dramatic upgrade onlast year’s 9 Pro XL model. When it comes to raw power, particularly for games, the Pixel falls short against rivals such as the Samsung’s Galaxy S25 Ultra, which remainsthe superphone to beat.Pros:seven years of software updates, great camera with 5x and 10x optical magnification plus AI zoom, great big screen, Magic Cue and impressive local AI features, Qi2.2 wireless charging and magnetic accessory support, good battery life, great size, fast fingerprint and face recognition, 12 months of Google AI Pro included.Cons:very expensive, huge and heavy, face unlock option not as secure as Face ID, raw performance and battery life short of best-in-class, no physical Sim card slot in the US, not a massive upgrade.View image in fullscreenNote that the Pixel 10 Pro XL comes without a physical sim slot in the top of the phone in the US, relying entirely on eSims.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianExplore more on these topicsPixelGoogleAndroidSmartphonesMobile phonesAlphabetreviewsShareReuse this content"

Are they dangerous, and should I be worried?DiagnosisWhat you are seeing are the fruiting bodies of fungi that were already present in the compost – they’re very common and usually nothing to panic about. These fungi thrive in moist, organic-rich soil, and mushrooms appear when conditions are just right, often after a period of regular watering and warm weather. While not harmful to your plant, they are toxic if eaten, so keep them out of reach of children and pets.Houseplant clinic: which plants cope best in darker rooms?Read morePrescriptionYou can pinch or cut the mushrooms off at the soil level and dispose of them. This will not eliminate the fungus, since it lives in the soil, but it will prevent the spread of spores. If you want to control their return, replace the top layer of soil or repot your plant in fresh compost.PreventionMushrooms are a sign of healthy microbial life in the soil, but if you prefer to keep them at bay, allow the top inch of soil to dry between waterings, and ensure your plant is not sitting in excess water. Regularly aerating the soil with a fork and keeping your pots in bright, well-ventilated areas also helps.Got a plant dilemma?

Officials initially said all 14 had been sent on to their home countries but lawyers for 11 said they were then held in dire conditions in a military camp.The 11 men filed a legal case seeking to be released. However, their lawyer Oliver Barker-Vormawor told a hearing on Tuesday that most had already been deported, despite eight claiming they could not legally be sent to their home countries “due to the risk of torture, persecution or inhumane treatment”.“This is precisely the injury we were trying to prevent,” Barker-Vormawor said, adding that the onward deportations meant their lawsuit had become irrelevant.Of the 11 men, six were sent to Togo and another released to a relative in Ghana, he said.On 12 September, lawyers in the USfiled a caseon behalf of five migrants sent to Ghana, who they said should have been protected from being sent on to Nigeria and the Gambia. The lawsuit said the men had been shackled on a plane from a Louisiana detention centre without being told their destination and several were put in straitjackets for 16 hours.A bisexual man had already been sent from Ghana back to the Gambia, where he had to go into hiding, the US lawyers said. The other four were being held in the military camp.In another development, Orville Etoria, who is Jamaican, was repatriated on Sunday to his home country fromEswatini, formerly Swaziland. Etoria, who was released from prison in the US in 2021 after serving 24 years for murder, had been deported to Eswatini without notice in July alongside former prisoners from Cuba, Laos, Vietnam and Yemen.“Mr Orville Isaac Etoria, at his own volition, without any compulsion whatsoever, was voluntarily repatriated back to his home country,Jamaica. Mr Etoria has safely returned to Jamaica, where he was warmly welcomed by members of his family,” Eswatini’s government said.It said the International Organization for Migration, a UN agency, had supported Etoria’s return and that it was working to have the other four migrants repatriated as well.“We are pleased to welcome home Mr Etoria and we trust the Jamaican public understands and joins the government in respecting his desire for a quiet return,” said Jamaica’s foreign minister, Kamina Johnson Smith.Lawyers for the five men said earlier this month they hadnot been granted accessto their clients in a maximum security prison in Eswatini.A Mexican who the US said had been serving a life sentence for murder was returned to Mexico earlier this month from South Sudan, having been one of eight men deported there in July.Associated Press andAgence France-Presse contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsGhanaEswatiniJamaicaDonald TrumpThe GambiaAfricanewsShareReuse this content"

On 11 September, the former paratrooper was sentenced to 27 years in jail for trying to stage a military coup after he lost the 2022 election to Lula.But the South American leftist warned the global threat persisted. “All around the world, anti-democratic forces are trying to subjugate institutions and suffocate freedoms. They worship violence, glorify ignorance, act as physical and digital militias, and restrict the press,” Lula said.In an unmistakable but indirect reference to the Trump administration, Lula slammed foreign attempts to meddle in Bolsonaro’s recent trial witha pressure campaign of tariffs and “arbitrary sanctions”.US-Brazil relations have foundered in the lead up to the annual summit, with the US president slapping 50% tariffs on Brazilian imports as a result of what he called the “political execution” of his rightwing ally.‘Classic tinpot dictator’: Trump exports his assault on democracy to BrazilRead moreTwenty-four hours before Lula’s speech Trump officials announced new sanctions against Brazilian authorities, revoking the visas of the country’s attorney general, Jorge Messias, and six other officials. It also hit the wife of Alexandre de Moraes, a supreme court judge who presided over Bolsonaro’s trial, with Magnitsky sanctions usually used to punish the perpetrators of major human rights abuses such as war crimes or torture.“Let this be a warning to others who threaten US interests by protecting and enabling foreign actors like Moraes: you will be held accountable,” tweeted , Marco Rubio, the secretary of state.Lula hit back at the UN, telling delegates: “There is no justification for unilateral and arbitrary measures against our institutions and our economy. Aggression against the independence of the judiciary is unacceptable.”Speaking immediately after Lula, Trump accused Brazil of “censorship, repression … judicial corruption and [the] targeting of political critics”. But, unexpectedly, the US president left the door open to a reconciliation with his South American counterpart, who he ran into when arriving at the UN headquarters. “I saw him, he saw me and we embraced,” Trump said of Lula.“We had a good talk and we agreed to meet next week ... at least for about 39 seconds we had excellent chemistry – it’s a good sign,” added Trump, who made no mention of Bolsonaro in his speech.The US pressure campaign has so far failed to save Bolsonaro’s skin. The 70-year-old politician is under house arrest and is expected to be taken into custody before the end of the year, with a maximum security jail in the capital Brasília one possible destination.On Monday, Brazil’s governmentvoiced“profound indignation” over the latest US sanctions, calling them an insult to “a democracy that successfully defended itself against an attempted coup d’état” and to “201 years of friendship” between the two nations.Huge pro-democracy protests on Sunday,where leftwing protesters denounced US interference and burned a US flag, appear to have further damaged Bolsonaro’s hopes of securing an amnesty that might help him avoid jail.Trump’s pressure campaign also appears to have boosted Lula’s chances of winning a historic fourth term in next year’s election. Lula’s sagging approval ratings have rebounded in recent weeks, with the leftwing veteran positioning himself as a flag-waving patriot fending off the gringo threat.Trinidadian fishers fear getting caught in the crossfire amid Trump’s Caribbean ‘war on drugs’Read more“Before the eyes of the world, Brazil sent a message to all would-be autocrats and those who support them. Our democracy and our sovereignty are non-negotiable,” Lula, 79, told the UN assembly to applause.In another indirect swipe at Trump, Lula criticised the recent US attacks on Venezuelan boats in the Caribbean, which have killed at least 17 people. “Using lethal force in situations ​that do not constitute armed conflicts amounts to executing people without​ a judgment,” Lula said, calling for the region to remain “a zone of peace”.Explore more on these topicsLuiz Inácio Lula da SilvaBrazilAmericasUnited NationsJair BolsonaroDonald TrumpTrump administrationnewsShareReuse this content"

Eyewitnesses say the police shouted “stop” twice before shooting towards the teens.Resident Johnny Inthisone told CBC News that the shooting unfolded only seconds after police warned the youths to stop.Despite efforts by police and paramedics to revive Rezayi, he was pronounced dead at a hospital.Bishop said Rezayi was struck by at least one bullet and that investigators were conducting a forensic analysis of the gun collected at the scene.Rezayi’s family, who immigrated to Quebec from Afghanistan, say the death of their son has left them with grief and few answers.“I love my son. I love my baby,” his mother, Fahima, told the Montreal Gazette. “Why did they shoot my baby?”Rezayi said the family has received almost no information since he was killed. “Nothing. They’re not giving me anything,” she said.The teen’s father, Sharif, said police didn’t come to the family home until nearly six hours after the shooting. “We sat here, not knowing. And then they came and told us he was gone,” he said.During the Tuesday press conference, Bishop said investigators retrieved a baseball bat and ski masks at the scene but declined to provide further specifics about the case, citing the ongoing investigation. She said five people had been assigned to the case.But she warned residents against pursing “private investigations” into the shooting.“A lot of people that are trying to understand what’s going on. I totally understand that, but they’re doing certain private investigations and they’re meeting with people,” she said, calling on anyone with evidence to come forward. “You have to trust us. We’re the ones who are doing the investigation. We’re an independent office. Our mission is to shed light on what happened and that’s what we’re going to do.”Explore more on these topicsCanadaAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

But for more than a quarter of 2025, he barely saw the sun. After being arrested by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) in March, the farm-worker activist was placed in a detention center in Washington state, where he remained until heagreed to voluntarily leave the US.“I probably would say five times, in the three months and a half I was in there, they offered me to go outside,” he explained on a Zoom call from his family farm in Guerrero,Mexico, where he has been for more than a month.Juarez Zeferino is among thethousands of peoplewho have agreed to leave the country after arriving without documentation – a group that isreportedlygrowing.His arrest was officially based on a deportation order about which he says he never received a notification.Between January and July, Ice datashows thatmore than 11,000 non-citizens reported that they had self-deported, but many others have likely done so without registering their departure with the government. The data does not make clear how many people, like Juarez Zeferino, chose to exit the US after being arrested.Colleagues, friends and supporters of the 25-year-old organizer believe he was targeted by the Trump administration for his success as a farm-worker organizer. Juarez Zeferino said he agrees with that assessment.“I would say definitely,” he said when asked whether he believes he was targeted. “I would say yes.”Ice did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Reached for comment in July, Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said that allegations of Ice politically targeting Juarez Zeferino were “categorically FALSE”, calling him “an illegal alien from Mexico with a final order of removal from a judge”.The weeks-long stretches indoors were just one major problem Juarez Zeferino faced during his time in the Northwest Detention Center in Tacoma, Washington, a massive facility that holds more than1,500 peoplewho are being threatened with deportation.Another was the food: meals would often arrive well after midnight, and at times featured “dangerously undercooked” meat. On several occasions, he said, detainees were served nearly raw, bloody chicken; those who ate it often suffered upset stomachs and painful cramps.View image in fullscreenAlfredo Juarez Zeferino.Photograph: Courtesy of Alfredo Juarez Zeferino“I asked the guards why a lot of the foods were undercooked, or what’s happening in the kitchen,” he said. “The general answer they would give is that they were understaffed.”The understaffing caused other issues, too. When Juarez Zeferino and others would attempt to receive medical care, for instance, they were often turned away after long, arduous waits.“When I got sick, I just tried to sleep,” he said. “I stopped even bothering signing up to see a doctor, because I really had no hope of getting in front of one.”The facility did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Juarez Zeferino’s most harrowing experience in the immigration jail came within his first week in the facility. At about 10pm, he saw a guard walking around with a list of detainees set to be placed on a deportation flight that night. He saw his name highlighted, and in a panic called his lawyer, who was able to have his name removed.“But the only way we were able to stop it was because I saw my name,” he said. “If I didn’t see my name, they would just have pushed me out, put me on a flight.”Despite these uncomfortable and sometimes torturous conditions, Juarez Zeferino struggled deeply with his decision to self-deport.“It was very hard, especially with all the work that I have done, the relationships I’ve built, to decide to leave,” he said. “I wasn’t sure how I was going to reconnect, or how I could continue the job of organizing.”During his 18 years in Washington, Juarez Zeferino fought for labor protections for undocumented agricultural workers like himself, with a remarkable success rate. As a teenager, Juarez Zeferino helped win a farm-worker union and organized an international boycott against berry giant Driscoll. He also played an integral part in winning statewide heat protections for outdoor laborers, a cap on rent and guaranteed overtime pay.Now, from Mexico, he is continuing to organize with Familias Unidas por la Justicia, the union he helped found, and Community to Community, the food justice group with which he organizes. Every week, he attends remote meetings.In recent months, he has been pushing Washington and other states to pass bills authorizing officials to regularly inspect Ice detention centers unannounced.He is also still organizing for farm-worker justice; one top priority is ending reliance on theH-2A contract labor program, which allows farm owners to recruit foreign agricultural laborers to work on their farms temporarily and then return to their home countries.Nearly athirdof all Washington state farm laborers have now been replaced by guest workers via the program, which Juarez Zeferino has for years staunchly criticized, arguing it crowds out domestic workers in favor of foreign laborers who can be far easier to exploit and mistreat.Juarez Zeferino believes the industry’s desire to “replace all local workers with imported guest workers” has fueled the Trump administration’s war on farm-worker activists. Since his arrest, border patrol agents in May arrested farm-worker organizers on aVermont dairy farm, and that same month Ice arrestedworkers on a New York farmwho were involved in a germinal labor case. In August, Iceraidedthe same New York farm again.“They really want to push out all those folks that know their rights,” he said.Juarez Zeferino is now pursuing a legal path to come back to the US, where he had lived since he was eight. In the meantime, he is enjoying his time back in Santa Cruz Yucucani, the village where he is living for the first time since he was a child. He is staying with his parents and siblings, who left the US just days before he was arrested, and his partner.Though he is still working on a farm, it belongs to his family, so he can take breaks whenever he likes.The best part of being back in Mexico, he says, is picking plants to eat – not from fields, but from mountaintops where they grow wild.“Just gathering the food is a whole experience,” he said.Explore more on these topicsUS immigrationTrump's retributionMexicoAmericasWashington statefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Last year, he told a senate inquiry into the killings that he offered“no apologies, no excuses”for his policies, saying: “I did what I had to do, and whether you believe it or not, I did it for my country.”View image in fullscreenRodrigo Duterte wasre-elected as the mayor of Davao Cityin May despite being in custody in The Hague at the time.Photograph: Eloisa Lopez/ReutersThe three counts of crimes against humanity relate to Duterte’s alleged involvement as a co-perpetrator in 19 murders carried out during his term as the mayor of Davao City, between 2013 and 2016, while the second count relates to 14 murders of “high value targets” in 2016 and 2017 when he was president. The third charge concerns 43 murders committed during “clearance” operations of lower-level alleged drug users or dealers, according to court documents, significant portions of which are redacted.Prosecutors allege that Duterte first introduced a plan to “neutralise” criminals when he was the mayor of Davao City, later implementing the same policy at a national level after he was appointed president in 2016.As the mayor, Duterte personally inducted hitmen into an infamous group known as the Davao death squad, and “christened” this group by spraying its members with a bottle of wine and distributing guns from a basket to each, it is alleged.Individuals whom Duterte and co-perpetrators believed they could trust and control were recruited to the group, including some who owed a debt to Duterte or the police, said the prosecutors. “Those who did not follow orders risked being killed and were disposed of when perceived as opposing or posing a threat.”View image in fullscreenDemonstrators in Quezon City hold placards demanding the conviction and imprisonment of Rodrigo Duterte beforehis first ICC appearance.Photograph: Eloisa Lopez/ReutersDuterte’s approval was required for its members to conduct killings in Davao City, it is alleged, while he provided the Davao death squad with “the necessary logistical supplies to perpetrate killings, such as firearms, ammunition, vehicles, safe houses, gasoline and communications equipment”.After he became the president, Duterte appointed individuals from Davao City to high-level national positions to continue the policy nationwide and establish a network of perpetrators including state actors such as law enforcement officers, non-police assets and hitmen, the court documents say.The documents cite numerous statements by Duterte during his presidential campaign in which he pledged to “neutralise” criminals, including his remarks that the number of criminal suspects killed “will become 100,000”, and the fish in Manila Bay would “become fat, because that’s where I will throw you”.As president, Duterte publicly offered financial incentives for killings, and promised to protect police officers from legal charges for killings.Duterte was due to appear at the ICC this week to hear the accusations against him. However, the sitting was postponed as the court is considering whether he is fit to do so. His lawyer, Nicholas Kaufman, has called for all legal proceedings to be adjourned indefinitely, saying Duterte is not fit to stand trial due to “cognitive impairment in multiple domains”.Explore more on these topicsPhilippinesRodrigo DuterteInternational criminal courtInternational lawDrugs tradeAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

The church is widely known for mass weddings, pairing thousands of couples who often are from different countries.The first lady and the Dior bag: the scandal shaking up South Korean politicsRead moreHan did not speak to reporters as she arrived at the Seoul court on Monday for a hearing on the warrant request. After an hours-long hearing, the court issued its decision in the early hours of Tuesday as Han awaited the verdict at a detention centre near Seoul, where she will now be held.The Unification Church had criticised investigators’ attempts to arrest Han, noting that she appeared for questioning last week while still recovering from a heart procedure earlier this month, and accused them of disrespecting an “internationally respected religious leader”.Former first lady Kimwas arrested and charged last monthon allegations including bribery, stock manipulation and meddling in the selection of a legislative candidate. Kim has denied the allegations, calling them “false information”.View image in fullscreenSouth Korea’s former first lady Kim Keon Hee, wife of impeached former president Yoon Suk Yeol, arrives at a court on 12 August.Photograph: Jung Yeon-je/APThe lawmaker, Kweon Seong-dong, a staunch Yoon loyalist who was arrested last week, has denied receiving money from the church. Investigators also last week visited the headquarters of his conservative People Power party to obtain documents in order to examine claims that Unification Church members signed up en masse ahead of the party’s 2023 leadership race to boost Kweon’s candidacy.South Korea has a long tradition of politicians courting religious groups, from powerful Protestant lobbies to homegrown movements around self-proclaimed messiahs. In a country that is majority secular, religious groups wield disproportionate political influence.Members of the ruling Democratic party, including leader Jung Chung-rae,have demandedthe People Power party’s dissolution should the allegations be proven, citing violations of constitutional church-state separation. Hwang Myeong-seon, one of the party’s lawmakers, said “political groups that parasitise on religious power no longer have the right to exist.”Former conservative heavyweight Hong Jun-pyo turned against his old party,calling it“no different from a political party dominated by pseudo-religious cult leaders.”Han’s arrest follows Japan’s courtorder to dissolvethe Unification Church in March after former prime minister Shinzo Abe’s assassination by a man whose family was said to be bankrupted by church donations.The investigation into Kim is one of three special prosecutor probes launched under Seoul’s new liberal government investigating Yoon’s presidency. Kim faces herfirst criminal trialon Wednesday, which her lawyers said she would attend.The others focus on Yoon’s planning and execution of hisshort-lived martial law imposition on 3 Decemberand his government’s alleged cover-up of a marine’s drowning death during a 2023 flood rescue operation.Yoon’s martial law lasted only a few hours before the liberal-led legislature voted to lift it. He was impeached later in December and formallyremoved from office in April. He was re-arrested in July and now faces insurrection and other charges.Prosecutors havesummoned himfor questioning on Wednesday over allegations he ordered drone missions to North Korea to create a pretext for the failed martial law. Yoon also has abail hearingscheduled for Friday, though he has continuously boycotted ongoing court proceedings and refused prosecutor questioning.His wife has been investigated over various criminal allegations, stemming from events both before and during her husband’s presidency. The suspicions include accepting luxury gifts through an intermediary from a Unification Church official who allegedly sought various business favours, including the church’s participation in a Cambodian development project. The official, who has been arrested, is also suspected of providing 100m won ($71,800) in bribes to Kweon.Han was questioned for nearly 10 hours on Wednesday last week and denied the allegations against her in brief comments to reporters.Han is the top leader of the church, officially called the Family Federation for World Peace and Unification, which her husband founded in 1954.With Associated Press and ReutersExplore more on these topicsSouth KoreaYoon Suk YeolAsia PacificReligionnewsShareReuse this content"

Authorities believed they had been dead for three to four years by the time their bodies were found.Hakyung Lee – a 45-year-old New Zealand citizen originally from South Korea – wasextradited from her home country in 2022, after a police investigation identified her as the mother of the two dead children.Lee represented herself at the high court in Auckland but did not speak or answer any questions throughout the trial. She was assisted by two standby counsel,RNZ reported.Throughout the three-week trial, Lee sat between a translator and a security guard with her head bowed, and her hair obscuring her face.Lee admitted to giving her children the antidepressant medication nortriptyline, putting their bodies in the luggage and into the storage unit, but argued she was not guilty of murder by reason of insanity, brought on by a depressive episode after her husband died of cancer in 2017.The jury at the Auckland high court found her guilty after just two hours of deliberations.She now faces a maximum sentence of life in prison with a non-parole period of at least a decade under New Zealand law.Standby counsel Chris Wilkinson-Smith had urged the jurors to return not guilty verdicts.“She was a normal mother and then something went seriously wrong … she did something she would never contemplate doing. She would never harm her children let alone kill them.”But Crown prosecutor Natalie Walker argued that Lee’s actions were a calculated act “to free herself from the burden of parenting alone”.Lee hid the remains of her children, changed her name and moved to Korea, Walker said.“I suggest this shows her thinking rationally, even clinically, about taking her children’s lives and then covering up her heinous crimes,” she said.“It was not the altruistic act of a mother who had lost her mind and believed it was the morally right thing to do, it was the opposite.”Explore more on these topicsNew ZealandAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

One pathway is for migrants in skilled roles who meet relevant experience and salary thresholds. The second is for migrants in trades and technical roles who meet qualification, work experience and wage thresholds.Immigration minister Erica Stanford said the skilled work experience pathway was designed to help employers retain experienced workers “who are already contributing to New Zealand’s economy and have demonstrated value in their roles”.The trades and technicians pathway recognises the practical skills needed in industries where qualifications obtained outside university are used and valued, she said.New Zealand citizens are leaving the country in record numbers. Between July 2024-2025, 73,400 New Zealanders left, compared with 25,800 returning home to live, according to Stats NZ.In January, the governmentrelaxed its visitor visa rulesto attract so-called “digital nomads”– people who work remotely while travelling – to work in New Zealand. The visa extends to influencers, as long as they are being paid by an overseas company.In February, the governmentloosened the requirementsfor its Active Investor Plus visa – commonly known as the golden visa – which offers residency to wealthy foreigners.Business New Zealand welcomed the latest change in settings, saying the new pathways will enable employers to retain skilled workers, while Infrastructure NZ called for a more urgent start date.But minor coalition partner New Zealand First broke with the government, choosing to invoke the ‘agree to disagree’ clause for what it said was an “unfocused immigration proposal”.“New Zealand is being used as a stepping stone into Australia,” said Winston Peters, the party’s leader and minister of foreign affairs.“We take them in, train them, up-skill them, look after their families, and then they emigrate.”Of New Zealand citizens who migrated to Australia in 2024, 35% were born outside New Zealand, according toStats NZ.“We need a smart immigration system that focuses on the needs of employers in New Zealand, industry, and kiwi workers – not policies that will lead to more immigration with no plan for our next generation.”Explore more on these topicsNew ZealandAsia PacificNew Zealand politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

However, he said: “That doesn’t justify it, I accept that I drank more than I should have that night.”He said he had reached out to the paramedics and apologised and that the incident was “completely out of character”.The premier, Chris Minns, told reporters that he wanted to be “frank” about why the decision was made, despite the incidents.“This decision was not made based on who had the mistake-free, perfect record. I want to make it clear that for me, it was based on who I believe should be in the commissioner chair on New South Wales’ worst day, and when the public’s in danger, and the New South Wales police force needs exceptional leadership,” he said.“He’s led the Reconstruction Authority. He’s had the most difficult command in the New South Wales police, not just for one year or two years, but for over a decade.”Lanyon was seconded to the acting chief executive of the NSW Reconstruction Authority, the state’s disaster recovery agency, in April.He had been a deputy police commissioner since 2019, and had been considered among the frontrunners for the commissioner role in 2021 when Webb took the reins. He was reportedly seconded to the Reconstruction Authority due to “fractures in his relationship” with Webb.In his nearly four-decade career with the force, he has led major crime-fighting commands against organised crime. He’s also overseen the state’s metropolitan policing operations, making him responsible for thousands of frontline officers.Lanyon was responsible for establishing Operation Amarok, which targets high-risk domestic violence offenders.Lanyon said, as commissioner, he will be focused on tackling organised crime, youth crime and “strengthening community safety in our regions, and supporting victims of domestic and family violence.“I also want to strengthen the culture of the New South Wales police force, [and] cultivate a culture of respect, professionalism, and fairness,” he said.“I want every officer, every member of the executive, part of one team, united behind the forces, goals, motivated by purpose and community.”“I acknowledge Commissioner Karen Webb for her distinguished 38-year career in the police force, she leaves a legacy of achievement as the first woman to lead the New South Wales Police forces and as a commissioner who delivered enduring reforms.”Webb officially retires from the force on 30 September. Peter Thurtell is currently acting in her role.Webb’s time in the top job was also met with controversy. She was widely criticised overher handling of the alleged murdersof Luke Davis and Jesse Baird, allegedly at the hands of police officer Beau Lamarre-Condon.In 2023, shedenied allegations of a “cover-up”over the Tasering of 95-year-old Clare Nowland. Webb was also scrutinised over$687,000 paid out to three media advisorsin two years.In a statement after she announced her resignation, Minns congratulated Webb saying she had “stood tall in moments of crisis, led significant reform to policing, and staunchly defended law and order in this state”.Minns said Webb would “leave behind a legacy of substance”, including in leading the response to the Bondi Junction stabbings, and inimplementing new “wanding” lawsaimed at removing knives from streets.Explore more on these topicsNew South WalesAustralian police and policingChris MinnsNew South Wales politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

It will be the third time in six months the prime minister has travelled to the United States.The meeting was locked in after Albanese was left off the president’s schedule in New York this week.Trump calls for nations to close borders and expel foreigners in UN speech: ‘Your countries are being ruined’Read moreThe pair are expected to see each other briefly at a reception for world leaders attending the UN general assembly on Wednesday morning, Australian time.“President Trump agreed to a meeting some time ago,” Albanese said. “We had another chat about it on the phone, and we’ll have a meeting in Washington DC on 20 October.“What [we] do is have discussions with President Trump that are diplomatic and where we have discussions with each other. I don’t broadcast everything.”Albanese and Trump are expected to discuss the Aukus nuclear submarine deal, Trump’s demands for Australia to spend as much as 3.5% of GDP on defence, and trade tariffs being imposed by the US.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailThe news came after Trump used his speech to the UN on Tuesday local time to dismiss moves by allies including Australiato recognise Palestinian statehood, insisting world leaders should instead demand the return of hostages taken by Hamas in the 7 October attacks.Blasting international efforts to fight climate change as a scam, the US president used a major address to the UN in New York to mock the measuring of carbon footprints as a “hoax made up by people … with evil intentions”.Albanese and the foreign affairs minister,Penny Wong, represented Australia at the general assembly, listening as Trump criticised countries accepting overseas migrants and lamenting that ending the war in Ukraine was a harder task than he had expected.Leaders laughed and took photos during the sometimes rambling 57-minute speech, one which had all the hallmarks of Trump’s campaign rally style and included a series of insults for the UN itself. He mocked predecessors Barack Obama and Joe Biden and mentioned a bid by his supporters for Trump to be awarded the Nobel peace prize.“If you don’t [move] away from the green energy scam, your country is going to fail,” Trump said.He called climate change “the greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world” and hit out at wind turbines and other renewables infrastructure.“All of these predictions made by theUnited Nationsand many others, often for bad reasons, were wrong.”Despite the majority of UN countries recognising Palestine – including France, Canada, the UK and Australia in a major conference this week – Trump talked for the same length about the war in Gaza as he did about a broken escalator and a faulty teleprompter at the UN’s headquarters.“Now, as if to encourage continued conflict, some of this body is seeking to unilaterally recognise a Palestinian state.“Instead of giving in to Hamas’s ransom demands, those who want peace should be united with one message: Release the hostages now.”Countries recognising Palestine, including Australia, routinely called for an end to the war and for the remaining hostages to be brought home immediately.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But it’s not even coming close to living up to that potential.”Trump’s attacks on climate change policies and green energy came a few hours before Albanese used an event hosted by Macquarie to pitch for investment in mining and process critical mineral reserves in Australia.Hosted by the bank’s Australian chief executive, Shemara Wikramanayake, Albanese will use the event to sell the government’s Future Made in Australia agenda and announce a summit hosted by the climate change and energy minister, Chris Bowen, and the industry minister Tim Ayres for potential investors.“The world’s shift to clean energy represents the biggest change since the industrial revolution,” Albanese will say.“We are looking at ever-increasing global demand for clean energy and the technology that generates and stores it.”Australia’s ambassador to Washington, Kevin Rudd, and Albanese’s partner, Jodie Haydon, will join the event, along with a slew of business leaders.It will come hours before the prime minister attends a cocktail reception hosted by Trump and his wife, Melania.On the sidelines of the meeting, Albanese spoke with leaders including Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Indonesia’s Prabowo Subianto, James Marape of Papua New Guinea and Nato secretary general Mark Rutte.Explore more on these topicsAustralian foreign policyDonald TrumpAnthony AlbanesePenny WongUnited NationsAustralian immigration and asylumnewsShareReuse this content"

On migration, he told Europeans that “your countries are going to hell.” On Europe’s approach to climate change, he said it was “on the brink of destruction because of the green energy agenda”. On the war in Ukraine, he saidEuropewas “funding the war against themselves. Who the hell ever heard of that one?”He even found time to target local politicians such asSadiq Khan, whom he called a “terrible, terrible mayor” and said that London “wants to go to Sharia law”. There was a barrage of claims about immigrants and questionable statistics about the prison populations in Germany and “beautiful Switzerland”. At moments, he would not have been out of place running for European parliament.“If you don’t stop people that you’ve never seen before, that you have nothing in common with, your country is going to fail,” he said during the speech. “I’m the president of the United States, but I worry about Europe. I love Europe, I love the people of Europe. And I hate to see it being devastated by [green] energy and immigration, that double-tailed monster that destroys everything in its wake.”This is red meat for his supporters, and observers from across the aisle in the United States quickly identified Trump’s likely audience as his own base. The first 10 minutes were almost a classic stump speech, with Trump telling foreign leaders about how well he had handled inflation and that after just eight months in office “we are the hottest country anywhere in the world, and there is no other country even close”.But then he turned his gaze to the failures of theUnited Nationsand other world leaders – in which an aide forecast that he would denounce “globalists”. US conservatives would have been delighted to watch Trump tear into European liberals, who were forced to watch and politely applaud as they were accused of gross mismanagement of their countries.“Let’s not pretend this is a foreign policy speech or dignify it by calling it one,” wrote Ned Price, a former deputy to the US representative to the United Nations during the Biden administration. “This is basically Maga madlibs. Trump is speaking to his political base, hitting each of his campaign trail hits, while addressing a room of leaders who’d rather be just about anywhere else.”If Trump’s speech did have a foreign policy predecessor, it would be JD Vance’s address earlier this year at the Munich security conference, whenthe US vice-president launched into a tirade against European leadersover conservative hobby horses including migration and claims that Europe was stifling free speech.“No voter on this continent went to the ballot box to open the floodgates to millions of unvetted immigrants,” Vance told them during a speech that the EU’s top diplomat said sounded like he was “trying to pick a fight”. “If you are running in fear of your own voters, there is nothing America can do for you.”Trump didn’t mention European voters on Tuesday, but he did accuse European leaders of “destroying your heritage” – a claim shared by rightwing groups in Europe with whom the US president and his allies have been increasingly friendly.“You’re doing it because you want to be nice, you want to be politically correct,” he told them mockingly. Once again, it sounded very much like the administration was seeking to pick a fight with Europe.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpUnited NationsEuropeanalysisShareReuse this content"

Three large drones, Danish authorities said, flew close enough to the runway to force the airport to close for four hours in an incident that inevitably raises wider questions about the security of the skies above Nato countries at a time whenRussiahas already shown it is willing to test the integrity of alliance airspace.Videos published by local mediashow what appears to be relatively large but unidentified craft with green lights near the Danish capital. The drones came in from multiple directions and left in a similar fashion, suggesting, Danish police said, they were operated by a “capable actor”, one with an understanding of how to pilot drones in such a way as to maximise nuisance and cause alarm.Bob Tollast, a research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute thinktank, said it was “another reminder of how vulnerable airports are”. It was not possible, he added, to jam frequencies “due to nearby civilian use of the electromagnetic spectrum, for radio communications, cell phones and the like” – while shooting down unidentified craft is an unrealistic option near heavily populated areas.Russian drone incursion into Poland ‘was Kremlin test on Nato’Read more​​If a Russian link is proved, it would be a significant moment for Nato, which is already on a heightened state of alert. It is two weeks after19 Russian decoy drones crossed the border into Poland, an incident which has been followed by furtherincursions into Romaniaand – in case Europe had not got the message – a 12-minuteflight into Estonian airspace by three Russian MiG-31 jetsover the Baltic Sea on Friday.The Polish incident alone was enough to prompt Nato to set up Operation Eastern Sentry, enhanced air policing over eastern Europe, with extra jets supplied by the UK, France, Germany andDenmark. But Copenhagen is about 300 miles from the nearest Russian territory, the exclave of Kaliningrad, and is not a location that Moscow was expected to target successfully.At the same time, it is a reminder how far new and relatively inexpensive Russian drones can reach. Russian Gerberas, the $10,000 decoy drones that flew into Poland, are generally considered to have a maximum range of about 370 miles (enough to reach Copenhagen from Kaliningrad). The better-known $75,000 Shaheds can reach further, probably more than 1,000 miles, depending on the exact configuration.There is also speculation the drones that approached Copenhagen airport were launched from a ship in the Baltic. Though so far unproven, it is theoretically possible, and would have given Denmark little time to react.Even if there is no Russian link to the Copenhagen incident, the sudden boldness of the Kremlin in Poland and Estonia is new territory for Nato. The US president, Donald Trump, seems little interested in the string of incidents, making no reference to subject inhis rambling speech at the UNon Tuesday – and it is European allies that have already been forced to step up air defences with extra fighter jets.Earlier on Tuesday, Denmark’s prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, also made a tentative link between the overnight drone flights and the hacking episode that has led toflights being disrupted in Brussels, Berlin and Heathrow airportssince Friday.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Though a Russian link cannot be confirmed in this case yet, the possibility has to be considered.Some experts, such as the former White House adviser Fiona Hill, have emphasised that while the west does not consider itself at war with Russia,Moscow has a different view. Its main focus remains the invasion of Ukraine, but from a Kremlin perspective it may be rational to try to impose greater costs on Europe, which is increasingly becoming Kyiv’s principal backer as the US pulls back.While there appears to be no intent to cause casualties, the recent incidents are an expensive nuisance and have already forced European Nato members to increase their active military deployment. Though Nato, meeting on Tuesday, said the alliance would use “all necessary military and non-military tools to defend ourselves”, it is not yet obvious that Russia has been deterred.Explore more on these topicsDenmarkNatoRussiaDrones (military)EuropeanalysisShareReuse this content"

Trump also attacked green energy initiatives as redistributing manufacturing power from the developed world to “polluting countries that break the rules and are making a fortune”.Trump says he believes Ukraine can regain all land lost to Russia since 2022 invasionRead more“Your countries are being ruined,” he also said, pointing to UN programs that he claimed provide food, shelter and debit cards to fund immigrant journeys to the United States. “The UN is funding an assault on western countries.”In many ways, the speech was an appeal to European leaders to embrace a blood-and-soil nationalism in which Trump laid out the recent US assault on immigration as a model for the world to follow.“If you don’t stop people that you’ve never seen before, that you have nothing in common with, your country is going to fail,” Trump said. “I’m the president of the United States, but I worry about Europe. I love Europe, I love the people of Europe. And I hate to see it being devastated by energy and immigration, that double-tailed monster that destroys everything in its wake.”Trump also singled out Sadiq Khan, the first Muslim mayor of a Western capital, saying: “I look at London, where you have a terrible mayor, terrible, terrible mayor, and it’s been changed, it’s been so changed. Now they want to go to sharia law. But you are in a different country, you can’t do that.”Repeatinga dubious claimthat he had ended seven wars during his eight-month administration, Trump said that the United Nations had only offered “empty words” and had not helped him “finalize” the negotiations.“The UN has such tremendous potential, but it’s not even coming close to living up to that potential,” he said. “All they seem to do is write a really strongly worded letter and then never follow that letter up. It’s empty words, and empty words don’t solve war. The only thing that solves war and wars is action.”Denouncing the Paris climate agreement that he abandoned during his first term, Trump called climate change a “con job” and ridiculed renewable energy sources like wind farms as a product of a “green energy agenda” that has brought countries to the “brink of destruction”.“It’s the greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world, in my opinion, climate change,” he said. “All of these predictions made by the United Nations and many others, often for bad reasons, were wrong.”‘Guess what?’ Macron phones Trump after US president’s motorcade blocks his carRead more“Immigration and the high cost of so-called green renewable energy is destroying a large part of the free world and a large part of our planet,” he said. “You need strong borders and traditional energy sources if you are going to be great again.”Turning to international diplomacy, Trump repeated an offer to levy heavy tariffs on Russia in order to end its invasion ofUkraine, but said that European countries would first have to cease buying Russian energy products.“Inexcusably, even Nato countries have not cut off much Russian energy and Russian energy products, which I found out about two weeks ago, and I wasn’t happy,” he said. “Think of it – they’re funding the war against themselves. Who the hell ever heard of that one?”‘A moment of paradox’After the speech, French president Emmanuel Macron mounted a defence of the current international order, saying the UN’s “harshest critics are also those that want to change the rule of the game, because they want to exert domination”.“That is the major risk of our time ... a risk of seeing the survival of the fittest. It is the risk of seeing the selfishness of a few prevail,” he said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The foreign minister of Hungary, one of the countries most sympathetic to Russia in Europe and Nato,said yesterdaythat his country would not stop buying Russian oil because it had no alternative.Trump gave only cursory remarks on the recognition of Palestine by the UK, France and other allies. The response came one day afterEmmanuel Macron publicly declaredin the UN that “it is time” to recognise a Palestinian state despite public condemnation by Israel and the United States.British officials have expressedfear that Trump could recognise Israeli controlover illegal settlements on the West Bank in retaliation, but he only mentioned the recognition of Palestine in passing.“Now, as if to encourage continued conflict, some of this body is seeking to unilaterally recognize a Palestinian state,” Trump said. “The rewards would be too great for Hamas terrorists for their atrocities. This would be a reward for these horrible atrocities, including October 7, even while they refuse to release the hostages or accept a ceasefire.”During the speech, Trump reaffirmed his decision to raise tariffs on countries around the world, targeting China and other nations that he claimed had broken international trade rules.“The countries that followed the rules, all their factories have been plundered,” he said. “It’s really sad to watch. They’ve been broken. They’ve been broken by countries that broke the rules.”Trump’s address to world leaders at the UN was for a different audience: his baseRead moreHe also called for world leaders to combat the spread of nuclear weapons and said the US would launch a new effort to prevent the use of biological weapons, claiming it would be integrated with artificial intelligence.“We just can’t ever use them. If we ever use them, the world literally might come to an end,” Trump said of nuclear weapons. “There would be no United Nations to be talking about. There would be no nothing.”Practically the only country he had kind words for during the speech was El Salvador for the “successful and professional job they’ve done in receiving and jailing so many criminals that entered our country”. The Trump administration haspaid El Salvadorto receive more than 200 Venezuelan immigrants it claimed were members of criminal gangs.Shortly after his speech, Trump’s tone shifted dramatically during a bilateral meeting with UN secretary general António Guterres. “Our country is behind the United Nations 100%,” Trump told Guterres. “I may disagree with it sometimes but I am so behind it because the potential for peace at this institution is great.”Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpUnited NationsEuropeRussiaUkrainenewsShareReuse this content"

The Kremlin’s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, accused Frederiksen of making “unfounded accusations”.Danish police said two or three large drones that were seen on Monday night close to the airport, which is also the main airport for southern Sweden, appeared to have been flown by a “capable operator” who was looking to show that they had particular capabilities. No suspects have so far been identified.The drones inDenmarkcame from multiple directions, police said, turning their lights on and off for several hours before disappearing.Oslo airport, Norway’s main aviation hub, was also forced to close for three hours after two drones were observed there.Tens of thousands of passengers were stranded in the Nordic region by the two incidents and flights had to be diverted. Authorities in Denmark and Norway are investigating whether the two sightings were related.The Norwegian prime minister, Jonas Gahr Støre, accused Russia of violating Norwegian airspace three times in recent months.View image in fullscreenMette Frederiksen said the incident had to be seen ‘in the context of everything else that is happening in Europe’.Photograph: Emil Nicolai Helms/EPAFrederiksen said in a statement it was a reflection of “the times we live in and what we as a society must be able to handle”.“The police assess that this is a capable actor and the Copenhagen police are working closely with PET [the Danish security and intelligence agency], the Danish armed forces and international partners on the investigation, which is in full swing,” she said.“We are obviously not ruling out any options in relation to who is behind it. And it is clear that this fits in with the developments we have been able to observe recently with other drone attacks, violations of airspace and hacker attacks on European airports.”She said in an interview it had to be seen “in the context of everything else that is happening in Europe”.“We have seendrones over Polandthat should not have been there, we have seenactivity in Romania,violations of Estonian airspace, we have a hacker attackon European airportsover the weekend and now drones in Denmark and Norway,” she told the Danish broadcaster DR on Tuesday morning.“Therefore, I can only say that this is in my eyes a serious attack on Danish critical infrastructure.”She said the incursion was intended to “disrupt and create unrest. To create concern. See how far you can go and test the limits.”She added: “I cannot in any way deny that it is Russia. We are seeing a number of hybrid attacks and sabotage and attempted sabotage. What exactly has taken place in Denmark, the authorities are now investigating.”Her Norwegian counterpart, Gahr Støre, said in a statement: “Russia has violated Norwegian airspace on three occasions this spring and summer.“We cannot determine whether this was done intentionally or due to navigation errors. Regardless of the cause, this is not acceptable.”He described the three Norwegian incidents this year as “smaller in scope” than those in Estonia, Poland and Romania, but they came after more than 10 years with no such incidents. He added: “They are nevertheless incidents that we view very seriously.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Gahr Støre said the border violations lasted between one and four minutes. According to the Norwegian government, the first incident, on 25 April, involved a Russian SU-24 fighter jet; the second, on 24 July, involved a Russian L410 Turbolet aircraft; and the third, on 18 August, involved a Russian SU-33 fighter jet.Separately, on Monday night, a couple from Singapore, tourists in their 50s and 60s, were reportedly arrested for flying a drone in central Oslo. The drone is being examined by authorities and there is no suspicion that it is related to the drone sightings at Oslo or Copenhagen airports.Jens Jespersen, a Danish police chief superintendent, said of the airport drone incident: “We have concluded that this was what we would call a capable operator. It’s an actor who has the capabilities, the will and the tools to show off in this way.”The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, claimed Russia was behind the Copenhagen incident. Danish police declined to comment on the claim.Among the theories being investigated by police is that the drones may have been launched from ships. Copenhagen airport is a short distance from the Baltic and one of the world’s busiest shipping lanes where hundreds of Russian “shadow fleet” ships are understood to be passing through, carrying crude oil on which sanctions have been imposed.Jacob Kaarsbo, a former chief analyst at the Danish defence intelligence agency, said launch from one of those vessels in the Baltic was “the most likely option”. The drones, he said, were fixed-wing drones, about 2.5 metres (8ft) wide, which would have required a special launch mechanism, meaning that it was most likely the work of a state actor.“We have seen Russia launch drones from shadow fleet ships before,” Kaarsbo said, citing a recent incident in German waters. “We have seen this modus operandi before where they use shadow fleet ships to launch drones, to do reconnaissance, or in this case to disturb public order.”Although larger models are generally able to travel longer distances, Kaarsbo said it was still unlikely a drone would have made it from the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad to Copenhagen airport without detection.Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, said she had spoken to Frederiksen about the Copenhagen incident, writing on social media: “While the facts are still being established, it is clear that we are witnessing a pattern of ongoing challenges at our borders.”Mark Rutte, Nato’s secretary general, said it was too early to say whether the incident in Denmark was connected to Russian violations of airspace elsewhere in Europe.There have been a number of disruptions at European airports in recent days. On Friday, a cyber-attack on check-in and boarding systems led to problems at London Heathrow, Berlin and Brussels.Explore more on these topicsDenmarkAir transportDrones (non-military)NorwayEuropeRussianewsShareReuse this content"

I’ll negotiate with you.”Macron, who remains stuck behind a metal barrier, takes out his phone and appears to call Trump directly. Leaning on the barrier, he says, laughingly: “How are you? Guess what? I’m waiting in the street because everything is frozen for you.”Macron later appears to be allowed through on foot but not in his car. Still on his phone, he proceeds to stride off down the street, past shoppers and pedestrians. The reporter from Brut said Macron walked for about 30 minutes with his security detail. He stopped and posed with passersby who asked for photographs, including one encounter with a man who kissed him on the forehead.“The time has come to end the war in Gaza, the massacres and the death,” Macron had said during his opening speech to a special summit at the UN on Monday evening. “The time has come to do justice for the Palestinian people and thus to recognise the state of Palestine in Gaza, the West Bank and Jerusalem.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst ThingFree daily newsletterOur US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They added that he would not be constrained by what he considered to be the failed frameworks of the past.A number of countries have recognised Palestinian statehood in recent days to coincide with a gathering of the UN general assembly in New York. The Trump administration called the move “performative” but it has not yet changed its policy in response.Keir Starmer, the UK prime minister, saidBritain’s recognition of Palestinewas taken “to revive the hope of peace and a two-state solution”. Emmanuel Macron, the French president,told the UN on Mondaythat “the time has come” for recognition, adding: “It falls on us, this responsibility, to do everything in our power to preserve the possibility of a two-state solution.”The move was made against the backdrop of an Israeli assault onGazaCity, coupled with an increasingly assertive posture in the West Bank.1:26'Better late than never': Palestinians react to countries recognising statehood – videoIsrael is already planninga new settlementknown as E1, which would in effect split the West Bank in two. Bezalel Smotrich, Israel’s far-right finance minister, has said he believed the development would “bury the idea of a Palestinian state”.Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel’s prime minister, is under pressure from within his cabinet to go further and either annex the West Bank in its entirety or partly, a move that would render impossible a single Palestinian state covering the West Bank and Gaza. He has said he would make no decision until after he had spoken to Trump early next week at the White House.Starmer spent much of his bilateral meeting with Trump last week explaining the reasons for recognising Palestine, and British officials were delighted when the US presidentappeared sanguineabout the prospect in their joint press conference.Trump has said little about the Israeli expansion in the West Bank but he is under pressure from some allies to endorse it.Mike Huckabee, the US ambassador to Israel,said last month: “I don’t know what the Europeans thought they were going to accomplish [with Palestinian recognition], but by their actions, they’re accomplishing something that I don’t think they wanted to do, and that is to essentially to give a green light or encourage the Israelis to go ahead and take more pieces of Judea and Samaria [the West Bank], either by declaring sovereignty or annexation.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst ThingFree daily newsletterOur US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Kushnerarranged a meetinglast month at the White House to plan for a postwar Gaza, which wasalso attendedby the former UK prime minister Tony Blair.Under the Blair plan, which one British government source called “the only game in town”, Gaza would be governed by a UN-backed international transitional authority, without needing to expel Palestinians from the territory.A spokesperson for Blair declined to comment.Such a plan would be undermined however if Trump recognised Israeli settlements in the West Bank, which Arab leaders would see as crossing a red line. Trump will see several of those leaders in New York on Tuesday at a private meeting during which they are expected to press him not to back Israeli actions in the West Bank.Anwar Gargash, a senior diplomatic adviser to the United Arab Emirates, said earlier this month: “In these challenging times, the UAE sends a clear message: annexation is a red line and peace through a two-state solution must remain the path forward.”The UAE sees itself as the guardian of the Abraham accords, which established diplomatic relations between Israel and a group of Arab states. With Trump’s blessing, the UAE signed the accords in 2020 after Israel agreed to drop a proposal to annex parts of the West Bank.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

But our greatest joy will come when there are no [political] prisoners in Egypt,” she added.British foreign secretary Yvette Cooper welcomed the news, saying: “I’m grateful to President Sisi for this decision. We look forward to Alaa being able to return to the UK, to be reunited with his family.”Egypt’s National Council for Human Rights, a state-funded body, also welcomed the decision, saying it signalled a growing emphasis on swift justice.Peter Greste, an Australian journalist who was imprisoned alongside Abd el-Fattah, told Australian Associated Press: “It’s absolutely wonderful news, I’m absolutely overjoyed, I think it vindicates all the work and the efforts of the people who lined up behind him.“I think it’s one of the most egregious cases of political imprisonment that I know, Alaa is an extraordinary human being who never should have been imprisoned in the first place.View image in fullscreenAlaa Abd el-Fattah stands next to his mother, Laila Soueif, and sister, Sanaa, at their home in Giza.Photograph: Mohamed Abd El Ghany/Reuters“I’m just overjoyed because I know better than anyone what that feeling is like and I can’t wait to speak in person,” he added.Prof Greste had participated in a hunger strike alongside Abd el-Fattah’s mother in London in January to bring attention to his case.Amnesty International’s Erika Guevara Rosas said the release was welcome but long overdue. “His pardon ends a grave injustice and is a testament to the tireless efforts of his family and lawyers, including his courageous mother Laila Soueif and activists all over the world who have been relentlessly demanding his release,” she said.The UK prime minister,Keir Starmer, is known to have telephoned Sisi three times to lobby for Abd el-Fattah’s release. His national security adviser, Jonathan Powell, also called for his release as did the former foreign secretary David Lammy. It appears a growing warmth in British-Egyptian official relations – including over how to handle the Palestine question – may have played a role in the president’s decision.Abd el-Fattah’s 69-year-old mother was admitted to hospital in London twice after going on hunger strikes to try to secure his release. The prominent activist and maths professor also held vigils outside the Foreign Office and Downing Street, saying she was prepared to die to achieve her son’s release.The campaign was also led by Abd el-Fattah’s two sisters, Mona and Sanaa, and other family members. They tried to keep a low profile once the possibility of his release became known, fearing that anything they might say could upset a delicate process. After hearing news of her brother’s impeding release, Mona issued a short tweet in Arabic saying: “My heart will explode.”Abd el-Fattah’s pardon was reported by al-Qahera News, which is linked to Egypt’s intelligence service. It said: “The Egyptian president issues a pardon for the remainder of the prison sentence for a number of convicted persons, after taking the constitutional and legal procedures in this regard. The pardon includes … Alaa Ahmed Seif El-Islam Abd el-Fattah.”The human rights council had recommended seven prisoners for release but its recommendations are not always followed.The chair of the foreign affairs select committee, Emily Thornberry, said: “I am absolutely delighted to hear Alaa has received a pardon.“Laila, Mona, Sanaa and Alaa’s entire family’s tireless campaign for his release has been incredibly moving. Their love for him was clear when I met Sanaa last year. I am so glad they will get to see him come home.”A writer and supporter of the Arab spring, Abd el-Fattah has been in jail since 2019.

The Tories have claimed that it used a “false excuse” of administrative errors.They have now released a leaked email from Labour lawyer Gerald Shamash, in which he advised McSweeney to drop his claim that he had been told he did not have to declare the donations, adding that he hoped to minimise publicity for the rule breach.“My advice, but it is in practice the only realistic route, we are being and have to be seen as transparent as possible,” Shamash wrote. “The amounts of the late reported donations is £739,492 and there are, in my view, no easy way to explain how Labour Together finds itself in this situation.“If Labour Together cannot deal substantively with questions I pose then perhaps simply best to base our case as to the non-reporting down as admin error.”It was only after McSweeney’s departure from the organisation that his replacement, Hannah O’Rourke, found almost three years of donations had not been declared and filed a series of late declarations to the watchdog.David Lammy, the deputy prime minister, has described the allegations over McSweeney’s handling of the donations as “muck-racking” but the emails threaten to reopen controversy surrounding Labour Together, which has supported Starmer’s leadership.McSweeney, who masterminded Labour’s 2024 election landslide, left his role with the thinktank in April 2020 to become a senior aide to Starmer in opposition and then in government.However, he has been facing growing unrest from Labour MPs in recent weeks over the party’s poor poll ratings, as well as criticism over his advice to Starmer to appoint Peter Mandelson as US ambassador despite knowing about his links to the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein after his conviction.Downing Street has refused to answer questions about McSweeney’s time at Labour Together, but Starmer’s official spokesperson said the prime minister continued to have “full confidence” in his chief of staff.Kevin Hollinrake, the Tory party chair, said: “TheConservativesare taking the unprecedented step of publishing leaked correspondence of the legal advice given to Keir Starmer’s chief of staff, Morgan McSweeney.“It shows how authorities may have been misled over hundreds of thousands of pounds of donations used to install Starmer as Labour leader. We believe there is a strong public interest in revealing the full truth to the public about possible criminal wrongdoing.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The outcome was made public and widely covered by the media at the time. Since this time, we have taken measures to ensure Labour Together is fully compliant with all Electoral Commission regulations.”An Electoral Commission spokesperson said: “The commission thoroughly investigated the late reporting of donations by Labour Together and published our findings in 2021.“We were satisfied that the evidence proved beyond reasonable doubt that failures by the association occurred without reasonable excuse.

At Reading crown court on Tuesday, a judge sentenced him to 12 months in jail after he admitted a single charge of breaching a restraining order. He was also handed a fresh restraining order not to contact Tweedy.Bannister arrived at her home by taxi for the fourth time on 19 June just before 10pm and rang the intercom system twice before peering over the gate, the court heard.Bannister claimed the singer had invited him to her home over Microsoft Teams, the court was told. In a victim impact statement, the singer said she was “stunned” when Bannister visited her home yet again, and that she had been forced to hire personal security.“Each time he returns the worry of his intentions intensifies,” she said. “I’m worried, nervous and on edge every time I open my gate. No person should have to feel this way.”“Daniel has made my young child scared,” she added.View image in fullscreenThe singer said she had been forced to hire private security.Photograph: Toby Melville/REUTERSJudge Alan Blake said: “She does not wish any contact with you and you are causing her anxiety. You have shown defiance to the court order. You need to draw a line under that behaviour.”Bannister was initially jailed for four months in September last year when he was handed a three-year restraining order, but breached it by turning up at her home in December.In March, he was jailed for 16 weeks for repeatedly turning up at Tweedy’s home while under a restraining order. During that hearing, the court heard Tweedy “immediately panicked” and was “terrified” when she saw him outside her home, fearing for the safety of her eight-year-old son.In 2012, Bannister killed Rajendra Patel, 48, who died as a result of an injury to his leg, at a south London YMCA shelter and pleaded guilty to manslaughter.Explore more on these topicsCherylCrimenewsShareReuse this content"

Do you have a full 11? Do you have subs on the bench?.”Football analogies are generally rare at events about parenting, particularly those that seek to tackle gender equality. But then, so are men. At the Working Dads’ summit – almost certainly the first in the UK – both were in plentiful supply, as fathers were urged to “create a new idea of masculinity”.Rae, founder of the network Parenting Out Loud, which organised the event, urged fathers to start a “new national conversation about working dads”.View image in fullscreen‘We are creating a new idea of masculinity,’ said Elliott Rae.Photograph: Jill Mead/The Guardian“We are creating a new idea of masculinity. A new model for what it means to be a man and a dad,” he told the several hundred attenders on Tuesday, who were joined by another 2,000 online.“In the face of increased far-right rhetoric, and some businesses rolling back D&I [diversity and inclusion] initiatives and demanding their employees come back into the office full-time … our voices need to be louder.”Rae said it was time for dads to be “loud and proud” about their parenting responsibilities, encouraging them to take all parental leave available to them, have an open calendar and be honest when they had to miss a meeting because of school drop-off or pickup.He appealed to men and women to work together to push for more equal parenting, arguing that it was vital to combat the motherhood penalty, which recent analysis of Office for National Statistics data suggested contributes to women with childrenearning a third less per weekand 20% less an hour than men with children. Noting that men account for aboutthree-quarters of suicidesin the UK, he argued that men involved in childcare were also less stressed and happier with their lives. “It’s not a competition, it’s not a zero-sum game,” he said. “It’s a win-win for everyone.”View image in fullscreenA mother and baby in the audience look on.Photograph: Jill Mead/The GuardianThe summit will put further pressure on the government to improve the UK’s paternity leave offering, which was ranked40th out of 43 in an international comparisonbased on Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development figures. Last week the Commons women and equalities select committee called its failure to commit to improving the UK’s paternity pay and leave during the current parliament “disappointing”.A government review of the UK’s parental leave system,which launched in July, was a “watershed moment” said MPs, but “tinkering around the edges of a broken system will let down working parents”, they said.View image in fullscreenAudience members at the event.Photograph: Jill Mead/The GuardianSpeaking at the event, the Labour MP Stella Creasy warned that Labour’s flagshipemployment rights billcould, by giving women better maternity rights, perversely result in more maternity discrimination in the short term. This could be combated by equalising parental leave, she said: “Changing the law on parental rights so that every parent can be present is about every parent being equally discriminated against.”The summit is a significant marker in a year when growing numbers of men have joined women’s voices in calling for better paternity leave in a bid to tackle entrenched inequality. In June, hundreds of fathers took to the streets to demand better paternity leave inthe first ever “Dad strikes”in London and Edinburgh.New campaign groupThe Dad Shift, which organised the protest, have also rallied a new group ofpredominantly male Labour MPs, many with seats in “red wall” constituencies, who are putting internal pressure on the government to appeal to men directly.View image in fullscreenA panel discussion at the summit.Photograph: Jill Mead/The Guardian“It does feel like this is a moment, it’s part of the zeitgeist,” said attender Oliver Daniels, a father of one who works for the childcare platform Bubble. He pointed to the coronavirus pandemic, credited with causing an 18% increase in the amount of timefathers spend looking after their children, as a turning point in the conversation.“Dads suddenly found it wasn’t just that they could be more involved parents, but that they wanted to be,” he said.A spokesperson said the government was committed to supporting parents to balance work and home and was making paternity leave a day-one right through the employment rights bill. “We know the parental leave system needs to be improved and are carrying out a review to ensure it best supports working families,” they said.Explore more on these topicsMenParents and parentingWomenFamilyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Three appeal court judges rejected her application.“Last minute attempts to frustrate a removal are intolerable, and I will fight them at every step,” Mahmood said. “We have taken immediate steps to tackle this issue by amending policy on 17 September. I have also commissioned work to consider wider reforms and what more can be done to prevent misuse of the modern slavery system.“I will fight to end vexatious, last minute challenges. I will robustly defend the British public’s priorities in any court. And I will do whatever it takes to secure our borders.”The high courtrulinglast week granted the Eritrean man 14 days to gather further evidence in support of his trafficking claim before any removal could take place.The court of appeal ruling on Tuesday against Mahmoud was made after judges heard arguments from the home secretary’s lawyers. After rising for a few minutes, the judges returned to court and said it was not necessary to hear arguments from lawyers representing the Eritrean asylum seeker before reaching their decision to reject the home secretary’s application.The Eritrean man, who arrived in the UK on a small boat on 12 August, was due to be deported on an Air France flight to Paris last week, but Justice Sheldon delayed his removal in a high court ruling.What the court decision to block deportation means for Labour’s ‘one in, one out’ deal with FranceRead moreHis lawyers had argued in the high court that he was entitled under UK trafficking rules to more time to gather evidence about his trafficking claim before being sent back to France.Although the decision on Tuesday by the three appeal judges, Lord Justice Arnold, Lord Justice Lewis and Lady Justice Elisabeth Laing, does not jeopardise the Home Office’s controversial “one in, one out” scheme overall, it deals a significant blow to the home secretary, Shabana Mahmood.Under the deal, the UK can send back any migrant who crosses the Channel illegally in return for accepting the same number of migrants in France who have a valid asylum claim here.Government lawyers put forward arguments that it was imperative to remove the Eritrean man, who cannot be named for legal reasons, as part of the scheme to prevent dangerous crossings. They said he could pursue his trafficking claim in France but this was rejected by the judges.So far only three people have been removed to France under the new deal. The first people from France were due to arrive on Saturday but this has been delayed.Kate Grange KC, for the home secretary, told the court of appeal on Tuesday that there was “considerable urgency” to make “one in, one out” work. She said the scheme was needed to break the business model of people-smuggling gangs.Grange told the court: “Winter is coming. Over the next few weeks temperatures will drop and journeys will become more hazardous.“We submit that the public interest in preventing and deterring these journeys could not be more serious or acute.”Rejecting permission to appeal, Lord Justice Arnold said: “The judge made no error of law or principle making the decision he did. None of the four grounds of appeal are sufficiently arguable to have a realistic prospect of success.”Explore more on these topicsShabana MahmoodImmigration and asylumHome OfficeEritreanewsShareReuse this content"

She also “humbly apologised” for criticising him in public and told him she was aware “you feel hellaciously let down by me”.Spare a thought for right-royal victim Duchess Fergie – it’s been another truly hellacious week | Marina HydeRead moreDescribing the phone call that prompted the email, Henderson told the Telegraph: “People don’t understand how terrible Epstein was. I can remember everything about that call.“It was a chilling call and I’m surprised anybody was ever friends with him given the way he talked to me.“He said he would destroy the York family and he was quite clear on that. He said he would destroy me. He wasn’t shouting. He had a Hannibal Lecter-type voice. It was very cold and calm and really menacing and nasty.He added: “The pressure she was put under to protect her family must have been huge. I am sure there were legal actions.“And this was long before the duke’s life had been ruined by his association with Epstein.

Nearly three hours of video and audio clips obtained by the Associated Press through a Freedom of Information Act request shed new light on the shooting that has escalated tensions amid a federal immigration crackdown in the country’s third-largest city.Chicago organizers say city needs support, not politicalization by Trump: ‘This is not a serious solution’Read moreDHS said Villegas González drove his car at officers, dragging one of them “a significant distance”, leaving the officer to “fear for his life”. The officer then opened fire. Federal officials have said their officers weren’t wearing body cameras at the time.Franklin Park police footage shows local officers arriving at the roadside where a car had crashed into a cargo truck in Franklin Park, about 18 miles (29km) west ofChicago.Two Ice agents attempt to explain to the police officer what had happened moments after an agent shot and killed Villegas González.“He tried to run us over,” an Ice agent says.“I got dragged a little bit,” said the injured agent, who can be seen walking and talking while wearing ripped jeans with blood on them.The videos show the first agent saying his partner had suffered “a left knee injury and some lacerations to his hands” while speaking over a radio.“Nothing major”, the injured officer says while putting his arms up to shrug off concerns.Immigrant rights advocates, Illinois’ top elected officials and Mexico’s president have called for a thorough investigation and more transparency after the shooting that put area schools on lockdown and prompted protests.“We want answers to questions that we have raised,” said Jesús “Chuy” García, a Democratic US representative in Chicago, on Tuesday. “The family is entitled to it. The community wants to know what is going on, and the public deserves answers as well.”Federal officials had previously said the agent suffered “multiple” and “serious injuries”. DHS, which has not identified either agent, said the injured officer who fired his weapon has been a member of Ice since 2021 and served in the military. DHS said it was the officer’s first time firing his weapon in a “use of force incident”.“His life was put at risk and he sustained serious injuries,” postedKristi Noem, the homeland security secretary who visited Chicago for an immigration operation last week, on Twitter/X last week. Marcos Charles, the acting head of Ice’s Enforcement and Removal Operations, told the AP on Friday that he had met with the officer in the hospital, saw his injuries and felt that the force used was appropriate. He declined further comment, saying there is an open investigation.Federal agents use teargas and pepper balls to break up Chicago Ice protestRead moreDHS officials did not return messages on Tuesday.The videos, from the perspective of multiple officers arriving on the scene, also show the two Ice agents performing chest compressions on an unresponsive man lying on the ground before other emergency personnel take over. Blood can be seen on the pavement.Ice operations in Chicago, where federal officials have arrested more than 550 people, have drawn comparisons to the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown in Los Angeles earlier this summer. In Los Angeles, at least two people died while attempting to evade Ice: a farmworker who fell from a greenhouse roof during a raid and a man struck by an SUV while running from agents outside a Home Depot store.Villegas González, who worked as a cook, had just dropped off one of his children at daycare the morning of the shooting in the close-knit and largely Hispanic suburb of roughly 18,000 people. DHS said he had a history of reckless driving and did not have legal permission to live in the US.The daycare’s director described him as a good father while many Franklin Park residents came to vigils and remembered him as a kind family man.The 38-year-old was from the state of Michoacan in western Mexico, according to the Consulate General of Mexico in Chicago, which said it would “closely monitor” the investigation.Explore more on these topicsUS immigrationIllinoisChicagoUS policingnewsShareReuse this content"

Why not?”Trump added: “Russia has been fighting aimlessly for three and a half years, a war that should have taken a Real Military Power less than a week to win.”map showing Russian-held territory in Ukraine and its recent and claimed advances in the border regionsThe US president said this was not making Russia look distinguished, but instead a paper tiger, pointing to the long queues for petrol inside the country. He added: “Putin and Russia are in BIG Economic trouble, and this is the time forUkraineto act.” He also promised “to supply weapons to Nato for Nato to do what they want with them”.Zelenskyy hailed Trump’s intervention, saying it represented a “big shift” from the US president. He added that he thought Trump could help change the Chinese president Xi Jinping’s stance on Russia’s war in Ukraine.Earlier, Trump said that he planned to enforce his demand that Nato countries stop importing Russian oil – including Hungary, led by his close allyViktor Orbán.Inhis speech to the UN general assemblythe US president renewed his demand for Europe to end its “embarrassing” purchase of oil and gas from Russia, saying until it did so he would not impose his long-promised economic punishment on Moscow.Trump also said he believed Nato aircraftshould shoot down Russian aircraftif they entered its airspace, but later qualified his remarks by saying it depended on the circumstances.He made his remarksalongside Zelenskyy, whom he described as a “brave man”. Asked if he still trusted the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, Trump said he would know in a month’s time.It came after the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, had given less wholehearted support for shooting down Russian planes in Nato airspace, saying this should only happen “if they’re attacking”.View image in fullscreenThe Lukoil refinery in Volgograd. Donald Trump said European countries must end their ‘embarrassing’ purchase of oil and gas from Russia.Photograph: ReutersIn his speech to the UN Trump mocked Nato allies’ failure to curb oil imports, saying: “China and India are the primary funders of the ongoing war by continuing to purchase Russian oil. But inexcusably, even Nato countries have not cut off much Russian energy and Russian energy products … I found out about it two weeks ago, and I wasn’t happy.“They’re funding the war against themselves. Who the hell ever heard of that one? In the event that Russia is not ready to make a deal to end the war, then the United States is fully prepared to impose a very strong round of powerful tariffs.“But for those tariffs to be effective, European nations, all of you … gathered here right now, would have to join us in adopting the exact same measures.”Trump did not specify the measures, but he has been stalling on a package that includes tariffs against countries that do business with Russia, such as India and China. He has already imposed 50% tariffs on India, but is also in the middle of negotiations that could see those lifted.Regarding Orbán, the Hungarian prime minister, Trump said: “He’s a friend of mine. I have not spoken to him [about importing Russian oil], but I have a feeling if I did, he might stop, and I think I’ll be doing that.”In response to Trump’s demands, the EU is trying to bring forward the date by which it ends the import of liquid natural gas imports from Russia to 2026 – a year earlier than planned. The EU is opposed to imposing vast tariffs on China or India, but is looking at more targeted measures against Indian and Chinese oil refineries.Trump said he would be discussing the issue with EU leaders, adding: “They can’t be doing what they’re doing. They’re buying oil and gas from Russia while they’re fighting Russia … They have to immediately cease all energy purchases from Russia. Otherwise, we are all wasting a lot of time.”The EU’s 19th sanctions package also proposes export controls on another 45 companies that are deemed to be cooperating on sanctions evasion. Those include 12 Chinese, two Thai and three Indian entities that have enabled Russia to circumvent the bloc’s sanctions.View image in fullscreenThe Druzhba oil pipeline between Hungary and Russia at the Danube refinery in Szazhalombatta, Hungary.Photograph: Bernadett Szabó/ReutersHungary’s foreign minister, Péter Szijjártó, told the Guardian thatHungary could not wean itself off Russian energy supplies. He said: “We can’t ensure the safe supply [of energy products] for our country without Russian oil or gas sources,” while adding that he “understood” Trump’s approach.“For us, energy supplies are a purely physical question,” he said. “It can be nice to dream about buying oil and gas from somewhere [besides Russia] … but we can only buy from where we have infrastructure. And if you look at the physical infrastructure, it’s obvious that without the Russian supplies, it is impossible to ensure the safe supply of the country.”Budapest relies on the Druzhba oil pipeline and the TurkStream gas pipeline to receive Russian hydrocarbons.Slovakia, the second EU country still importing Russian oil, said it had already spoken to the US about the issue, and received a sympathetic response. “As long as we have an alternative route, and the transmission capacity is sufficient,Slovakiahas no problem diversifying,” said the economy minister, Denisa Saková.Hungary and Slovakia are the two countries that have most frequently called for the EU to reduce its support for Ukraine.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpUkraineOilRussiaNatoTrump tariffsUS foreign policynewsShareReuse this content"

His subsequent elevation to a high-ranking post is unusual in light of that arrest, experts said.Aakash Singh, 33, became an associate deputy attorney general this year and has been instructing attorneys to prioritize charges against protesters and people committing misdemeanors, even allegedly advising them to call new grand juries if they fail to get felony indictments.Singh received the promotion from assistant US attorney after Trump took office, following a relatively brief legal career. While he was serving as an assistant US attorney in North Carolina in 2021, police in Raleigh arrested Singh and charged him with driving while impaired, according to police records obtained by the Guardian. That month, Singh was prosecuting several high-profile cases for the US government, including violent robberies and fentanyl trafficking.The role of associate deputy attorney general is typically staffed by a handful of senior career attorneys advising the deputy attorney general.Promoting someone who has a criminal history to associate deputy attorney general is not typical, Ken White, a former federal prosecutor, said.“The DoJ tends to be super harsh about criminal background,” White said. “I was told if you ever smoked pot, forget [being hired as an assistant US attorney] and DoJ is even more strict.”Former federal prosecutor Mark Rasch said that a DWI isn’t necessarily career-ending at the justice department, but that an offense like that would typically be vetted and investigated internally. “It’s unusual, but could be survivable,” he said.Singh did not reply to multiple requests for comment. A justice department spokesperson said: “Aakash is a valued member of the Department who plays an important role in ensuring the President’s America First agenda is carried out. That includes standing firmly with law enforcement and making sure our streets are safe from rampant violent crime. We are proud of the work he and this Department do every day to restore law and order for the American people.”Singh has emerged as a vocal enforcer of directives from Jeanine Pirro, who is the US attorney for the District of Columbia, and Donald Trump to aggressively charge people amid the federal crackdowns in Los Angeles and Washington DC.Last month, the justice department attempted to bring harsh charges against people protesting the military and federal police presence in DC, along with people simply swept up in the crackdown who were arrested for offenses typically prosecuted as misdemeanors. A grand jury rejected felony assault charges for a man whoallegedly threw a sandwichat a Customs and Border Protection officer last month; the man, Sean Dunn, was fired from the justice department after the incident, where he had worked as a paralegal.Singh encouraged US attorneys to not bedissuaded by widespread criticism of those attempts, according to the New York Times. The number of felony cases prosecutors in DC have dismissed has increased to 11,causing a magistrate judge to warn prosecutors: “That’s not the way it’s supposed to work, and it has real-world consequences.” At least six DC grand juries have failed to return federal indictments – a result called a “no bill” – since August, an unprecedented number in a short time,legal experts say.Singh met with federal prosecutors in August and advised them that if grand jurors refused to indict on those aggressive charges that they should impanel new grand juries, according to the New York Times.In June, amid widespread protests against Ice actions in Los Angeles, Singh instructedall 93federal prosecutors to not only prioritize prosecuting protesters, but to publicize those cases. Some of those ensuing federal charges alsofailed to get California grand juries on board.Federal prosecutors failing to win indictments is historically highly unusual, Rasch said, considering the advantages the federal government usually enjoys.“That’s a warning sign that there is something wrong with the case, if the jury says you didn’t even meet the threshold for probable cause,” Rasch said. He added that trying to maximize charges by stacking crimes in these recent justice department high-profile cases in DC is “abusive”.“The idea isn’t to throw the book at someone, it’s to charge appropriately,” he said.White agreed, saying that Singh’s reported instruction to keep calling grand juries was “ludicrous”.“That’s way out of line and completely unlike anything I ever heard at the DoJ,” he said.The justice department disputed the Times’s account of Singh’s comments, saying: “Aakash never said ‘simply impanel new grand juries’. The context was what should AUSAs [assistant US attorneys] do when they have a case that meets the elements of the crime, but grand jurors refuse to say yes to probable cause when they swore an oath to be impartial in evaluating a case. Aakash’s advice to them was to flag those issues for the US attorney who can discuss with the district court judges so the courts can remind the grand jurors that they swore an oath to be impartial in evaluating a case.”In September 2021, the Raleigh police department arrested Singh in downtown Raleigh at approximately 10pm, and he scored a 0.11 on a breath test, according to police records.Singh’s eyes appeared bloodshotin a mugshot posted by Wake county.Singh was charged with a level 5 DWI, which is a standard charge based on his intoxication level with no aggravated factors under the state’s DUI laws, North Carolina attorney T Greg Doucette said. Singh pleaded guilty and was ordered to pay a total of $393, serve 24 hours of community service and undergo a substance abuse assessment, and his license was revoked for 30 days. His defense attorney was a former assistant district attorney in the county.US attorney Ed Martin, Trump’s original pick for DC US attorney and now director of the DoJ’s “Weaponization Working Group”, appears to be a fan of Singh, calling him “The Great One”in a May X post.Mike Davis, a staunch Trump ally who previously served as chief counsel for nominations to Chuck Grassley, chair of the Senate judiciary committee, called Singh a “a close friend” in a January X post supporting Martin’s then-appointment. He hailed Singh and a colleague as helping Martin “kick down the door” of what he viewed as an office corrupted by “lawfare and political persecution”.Singh graduated George Washington University law school in 2017.Rasch said that a 2017 law school graduate being promoted to such a high-level political appointment at the justice department is unusual.“Normally these political appointees are chosen not only for political reasons, but because they have credentials that are impeccable, with extensive prosecutorial and managerial experience,” he said. “But political fealty seems to be the single qualification now [under the Trump administration].”“And what about the hypocrisy,” Rasch said. “Why did someone who threw a sandwich get fired [from the justice department] while someone convicted of drunk driving get promoted?”Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationUS justice systemnewsShareReuse this content"

Though charged with no crime, the 25-year-old was subjected to a cheek swab to collect their DNA, which was sent to the FBI, according to a new report. The unnamed citizen was later admitted into the country. Their DNA was added to the FBI’s database of genetic material despite the lack of criminal charges.The 25-year-old is one of about 2,000 US citizens whose DNA was collected between 2020 and 2024 by the Department of Homeland Security and shared with the FBI, researchers fromGeorgetown’s Center on Privacy and Technologyfound in an analysis of recently released data from US Customs and Border Protection (CBP). CBP officers took genetic material from some citizens as young as 14, according to the report.“In a flagrant and alarming abuse of power, the DHS has been regularly collecting DNA from US citizens without legal justification,” said Stevie Glaberson, the director of research and advocacy at Georgetown’s privacy center. “The lack of checks on DHS’s collection power we think renders the program unconstitutional and violates the fourth amendment.”Immigrant rights activists braced for crackdown as Trump threatens to target ‘leftwing’ groupsRead moreOnce immigration authorities collect DNA and share it with the FBI, it is stored in a database called the Combined DNA Index System (Codis), which is used across the country by local, state and federal law enforcement to identify suspects of crimes using their DNA. A May 2024report, also from Georgetown’s Center on Privacy and Technology, found that CBP had been collecting the DNA information of every migrant detained. Border patrol was also collecting and sharing the DNA information of migrant children, according to the agency’s data. Initial estimatesshowthat the sensitive genetic information of about 133,000 teens and children was being uploaded and stored in this federal criminal database in perpetuity.The new CBP documents specifically cover how many US citizens have had their genetic information collected at various ports of entry, including major airports. The agency compiled the data and included the ages of the people whose DNA samples were collected by border agents as well as what charges were being levied against them. Like the 25-year-old, about 40 US citizens had DNA samples taken by CBP and shared with the FBI even though they were charged with no crime. Six of these were minors.Under current regulation, CBP is permitted to collect the DNA of any individual – regardless of citizenship status – who has been arrested, is facing charges or has been convicted of a crime, as well as non-US citizens who have been detained.What the law does not allow border patrol agents to do, Glaberson asserts, is collect the DNA samples of US citizens simply because they have been detained. But the recently released data shows that CBP does not have a system to check whether there is a lawful reason to collect an individual’s DNA, she said.In some unusual cases, US citizens had their DNA swabbed for civil – not criminal – infractions such as “failure to declare” – which could be as simple as a person not declaring an item they bought abroad. In at least two cases of citizens having their DNA swabbed, the CBP agent simply wrote down “inspection by immigration officer” under charges.“This is CBP’s own administrative data,” Glaberson said. “This is what they’re writing down. What that data shows is pretty chilling. In case after case, CBP agents are pulling US citizens aside and swabbing their mouths without any reason to do so.”In about 865 of the nearly 2,000 cases of US citizens having their DNA swabbed by the CBP, no formal federal charges were filed. That means the cases never went before an independent arbiter such as a judge, according to Glaberson.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The information, accessible in a criminal database used to investigate suspects of crime, could subject people to investigations that they would otherwise not be swept up in, Glaberson said.“If you think that your status as a citizen protects you from of the authoritarian practices, this is proof that it does not and will not,” she said.Explore more on these topicsTechnologyUS immigrationDNA databasePrivacynewsShareReuse this content"

Minor tweaks to beloved theme songs, shuffles to commentary booths and analysis teams, new scoreboard graphics, even changes to the duration and placement of ad breaks: all of these can trigger days, sometimes even years, of volcanic debate. For a certain type of sporting masochist it’s possible to plug into corners of the online sportingverse that are still litigating, say, the chyrons from the 2010 NBA finals, or ESPN’s decision – originally made in 2011, reversed in 2017, then reinstated in 2020 – to cut ties with Hank Williams Jr and his legendary All My Rowdy Friends Are Here on Monday Nightintro songfor Monday Night Football.The outrage prompted by the latest upheavals at ESPN certainly fits the pattern of involuntary fan resistance to change, but on closer inspection this is more than a case of a few disgruntled cable TV subscribers reenacting the “old man yells at cloud” meme. In August ESPNannouncedit was bringing on Katie Feeney, a recent Penn State graduate with 14 million followers across YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, and Snapchat, to produce sports and lifestyle content – offering “a blend of on-site access, fashion, and culture”, as the press release put it – for the network’s main broadcasts and digital channels.Feeney’s hiring is the latest move in ESPN’s drive to appeal to younger viewers, all those sewn-to-their-phones and (presumably) lifestyle content-hungry Gen Z and Gen Alpha hordes unenthused by the stuffier news-and-dad-banter offering ofESPNmainstays like SportsCenter and Pardon the Interruption. In 2020 the network brought on sporting influencer Omar Raja, founder of the House of Highlights, as a digital commentator, and its in-house “creator program”, a kind of year-long fellowship for promising young influencers that acts as a beachhead for ESPN into the burgeoning creator economy, is now in its third iteration.On its surface, the new ESPN looks innocent enough, and the network is hardly alone in trying to get down with the kids and freshen its output with a spritz of youthful rizz: the NBA and other leagues have introduced creator programs, MLB has invested in the podcast network Jomboy Media, and Fox Sports is collaborating with Barstool Sports. (The founders of Jomboy and Barstool are hardly young – Dave Portnoy, for example, is in his late 40s – but the material these networks produce is designed to go big on social media and rope in younger fans.) On the one hand, this is just the way sports broadcasting operates now: what fans see on their screens emerges from a series of “partnerships” with off-the-shelf online brands and personalities, rather than reflecting something more innate and homegrown about the journalistic metabolism and personality of the network itself.How the rightwing sports bro conquered AmericaRead moreThe output from influencers like Feeney and Raja, only a small fraction of which makes it to air on ESPN’s cable programming, is a mix of fan interviews, “crazy” scenes live from the tailgate, sideline clips that reveal nothing surprising from the sideline (the general tenor of which is, “The game is about to start!” or “Wow, can’t believe I’m here!”), get ready with me reels, behind the scenes footage of famous ESPN broadcasters standing around looking at their phones, and minute-long “hot takes” that are so thumpingly uninteresting they seem designed to instantly kill any debate. (“My hot take is that if your favorite teams aren’t all from the same city, you’re not a real fan” was arecent offeringfrom Raja, to which the only reasonable response is: OK?)This stuff is all trivial and expendable by design, but it’s hardly offensive: anyone who consumes sports on the internet is inured to this type of garbage, and the social media platforms are awash with sugary, under-one-minute video hits of players building their ideal teams or pronouncing their own names or trying to execute the perfect dap or naming their favorite pasta. It’s not as if creators like Feeney and Raja, however much noise ESPN has made about hiring them, enjoy the kind of prominence on air during live broadcasts that a fellow influencer like Dave Portnoy, say, commands over on Fox. For the most part, these figures feel like summer interns in a world still dominated by the big beasts of gameday.On the other hand, influencer creep symbolizes a broader rot at the heart of ESPN. It’s important to set these moves in their proper context. In just the past 12 months the network has inked a new$100m, five-year deal with Stephen A Smiththat allows him to be even louder than usual; it’s snapped up Inside the NBA, perhaps the most universally admired talk show in American sports broadcast history, from TNT; and most tellingly of all, it’s reached a deal with the NFL, an organization it is nominally supposed to cover critically, that will see the league take a 10% equity stake in ESPN in exchange for the rights to the NFL network and the league’s popular RedZone channel.Taken together, these deals herald a major shift: away from the adversarial tradition of reporting that the Entertainment and Sports Programming Network once stood for, toward a much more accommodating and insider-driven approach to covering sports. ESPN’s embrace of the creator economy is part of this broader push for a cozier relationship with power. For years, ESPN has managed a conflict between its dual function as both a broadcaster and a news service, screening professional sports even as its in-house reporters subjected those same sports to aggressive journalistic scrutiny. That tension was always difficult to negotiate, but the disruptions of the smartphone economy, which has blitzed attention spans, pushed the epicenter of sports talk away from cable TV to social media, and handed more power to individual leagues, teams and athletes to shape and influence media narratives to their liking, have made live sport the absolute business priority for networks like ESPN.View image in fullscreenThe NFL is a huge part of ESPN’s business model.Photograph: Adam Hunger/APSeveral highly regarded journalists have left ESPN in recent years, as the paramount importance of live programming to the network has become clear and reporting has come to be seen as a privilege, or a burden, or sometimes both. Among those who have left are excellent reporters and writers such as Zach Lowe and Pablo Torre, who recently reached a licensing deal to produce Pablo Torre Finds Out, his excellent, eponymous investigative podcast, for the New York Times. This continues a decade-long exodus of similar talents from ESPN, including Colin Cowherd and Dan Le Batard, extending all the way back to Bill Simmons’s acrimonious departure from the network in 2015.Does ESPN care that they no longer have these personalities, all of whom have gone on to have successful careers after leaving the network, to enrich their programming and “content” around game days? Did the studio executives look on in envy as Torre unspooled his string of summer love scoops, from theBill Belichick-Jordon Hudson romanceto thehectic coupling of Kawhi Leonard and a tree-planting company? It seems unlikely. When they have Katie Feeney locking in the youth demographic withsponconfor Neutrogena Hydro Boost (“my go-to for hydrated, juicy skin”) and bringing viewers exclusive, behind-the-scenesfootageof what @SAWEETIE, “the first ever female curator for Monday Night Football”, would do as her touchdown celebration dance, what need does ESPN really have for the fussy old business of journalism? The stories all come from inside the locker room now, or directly from the players themselves: questions, criticism, scrutiny are anathema to ESPN’s fresh mission as a souped-up PR agency. There is stillworthy reportingthat comes out of the company’s creaking news arm but it’s clear that ESPN’s priorities now lie elsewhere.Increasingly, it seems like the old media model, in which the networks that broadcast live sport could do double duty as aggressive excavators of those same sports’ ugly truths, has passed. From now on, sports coverage is divided between two camps. On one side are the insiders, the broadcasters, the image-fluffers, fabulously well resourced and operated for mutual benefit in partnership with the sports world’s most powerful entities; on the other are the outsiders, the journalists, the critics, perpetually strapped for cash and digging for revelatory nuggets around a sporting-corporate PR machine that’s built to withstand the apocalypse. Where it once tried to keep a foot in both camps, ESPN now stands irrevocably on the side of the powerful: a company that once set the news agenda in sports is now just another sweaty social media setup fishing for quick clicks.With occasional noble exceptions,whatever sports “content” it produces from this day forward will be necessarily soft-focus and unchallenging.The vapidity of the new ESPN captures the crisis of modern sports media. In the attention economy, what exactly is the role of broadcast media during the lulls when sports are not being played live? For a shrinking corner of the professional commentariat, sport in its “dead” time is still something to subject to sustained critique and discussion, a topic appropriate for serious journalism and analysis. But for ESPN, sport has become fluff, visual candy cotton, an inexhaustible source of sugar in a contest for viewer-consumers’ addiction as endless as the feeds on our phones. Rather than pushing back against the easy tyranny of the vacant scroll, ESPN is giving in to it, trying to ride it – and the vision of a zonked-out, lobotomized viewership is captured perfectly in the network’s Black Mirroresquenew slogan, “Sports Forever”.By chasing dollars, ESPN is betraying the very fans on whose passion it has built its success, trading away its journalistic credibility for a diminished status as the glorified Pravda of the modern American sportscape. The network’s approach to covering sport now is properly post-journalistic, built on player access, highlights, fan experiences, viral squirts of memebrain swill skimmed from the trough of online trend culture, and zero contestation. It’s a strategy that elevates narrative management over entertainment, teams over viewers, money over truth. And increasingly, it feels like the future – a reality that should trouble anyone who cares about sports and the real stories that shape them.Explore more on these topicsUS sportsESPNUS television industryTelevision industrycommentShareReuse this content"

It was Liverpool’s sixth late winner in a seven-game winning sequence but their celebrations were tainted by Ekitiké receiving a second yellow card for removing his shirt. He will miss the visit to Crystal Palace on Saturday as a consequence of a dismissal for which Slot made no excuses.“The first one [for dissent] was already needless and, to a certain extent, stupid, as you have got to control your emotions,” the Liverpool head coach said. “With the second one I told him that if you score in the Champions League final in the 87th minute after outplaying three players and hitting it in the top corner … I can maybe understand he is like: ‘This is all about me.’ But I’m old-fashioned. If I scored a goal like this I’d have walked up to Federico Chiesa and said: ‘This goal is all about you, this is not about me.’ Needless, not smart, you call it stupid, I called it stupid right away as well.”Ekitiké was quick to apologise for his dismissal after the game. “It’s always the best to control your emotions. If you can’t, do it in a way that doesn’t lead to a yellow card,” the forward wrote on Instagram. “I was so excited tonight to help the team achieve another victory here … the emotion got the better of me tonight. My apologies to all the Red family.”Before kick-offLiverpool paid tribute to Matt Beard, the former manager of Liverpool Women whose death at the age of 47 was announced at the weekend. A period of silence was observed in memory of the coach who won two Women’s Super League titles with the club in 2013 and 2014 and promotion back to the top flight in his second spell in charge.Slot stuck to his promise to field a completely different lineup to the side thatwon the Merseyside derbyon Saturday. Leoni partnered Joe Gomez in central defence for his first appearance since a £26m summer move from Parma and the teenager was a towering, composed and alert presence.An impressive night’s work came to a horrible end, however, when the 18-year-old’s knee appeared to give way as he tumbled off the pitch late on. There are immediate fears of an anterior cruciate ligament injury. “Tomorrow he will probably have a MRI scan to see how serious it is,” Slot said. “Normally the emotions of a player tell you a lot. Let us hope for the best.”View image in fullscreenAlexander Isak (centre) is congratulated by Curtis Jones (left) and Rio Ngumoha after scoring his first goal for Liverpool.Photograph: Phil Noble/ReutersIsak could have had his first Liverpool goal with only 46 seconds on the clock. There were echoes of Russell Martin’s Southampton from last season when the visitors were caught taking too many risks at the back by Curtis Jones and Chiesa found the £125m striker free on the penalty spot. The goalkeeper Alex McCarthy, one of those responsible for inviting Liverpool pressure, atoned by blocking Isak’s goal-bound shot with his chest.The first‑minute exchange proved deceptive. There was no Liverpool onslaught. Instead, Southampton took the game to their Premier League hosts. Adam Armstrong drew a fine fingertip save from Giorgi Mamardashvili after a one-two with Ryan Manning.The Championship side should have taken the lead when Archer released Armstrong through on goal. The forward’s clipped effort sailed over Mamardashvili and struck the crossbar. No matter, Léo Scienza was first to the rebound and with only Leoni covering the Liverpool goal appeared certain to score. He steered a free header wide of the Kop goal from five yards out. Liverpool were ahead a minute later.

It was to be the record signing’s final contribution as Slot eases the striker back to match fitness following his summer strike at Newcastle.Liverpool had more control after the interval with Ekitiké’s movement and Chiesa’s industry occupying Southampton, although sloppiness in possession continued to offer hope and space to the visitors.

Major League Baseball’s 11-man competition committee on Tuesday approved use of the Automated Ball/Strike System in the major leagues in 2026.Human plate umpires will still call balls and strikes, but teams have two challenges per game and get additional appeals in extra innings. Challenges must be made by a pitcher, catcher or batter – signaled with a tap of the helmet or cap – and a team retain their challenge if successful. Reviews will be shown as graphics on outfield videoboards.MLB players are giving their new robot umpire overlords a cautious welcomeRead moreAdding robot umps is likely to cut down on ejections.MLBsaid 61.5% of ejections last year were related to balls and strikes, as were 60.3% this season through Sunday. Big league umpires call roughly 94% of pitches correctly, according to UmpScorecards.ABS, which utilizes Hawk-Eye cameras, has been tested in the minor leagues since 2019. MLB switched Triple-A to an all-challenge system in June 2024, then used the challenge system in spring training this year.Teams won 52.2% of their ball/strike challenges (617 of 1,182) challenges in spring training. In Triple-A this season, the average challenges per game increased to 4.2 from 3.9 through Sunday and the success rate dropped to 49.5% from 50.6%. Defenses were successful in 53.7% of challenges this year and offenses in 45%.MLB has experimented with different shapes and interpretations of the strike zone with ABS, including versions that were three-dimensional. Currently, it calls strikes solely based on where the ball crosses the midpoint of the plate, 8.5 inches from the front and the back. The top of the strike zone is 53.5% of batter height and the bottom 27%. Each player will be measured in preseason to endure their height is accurate when being assessed by ABS.The challenge system introduces ABS without eliminating pitch framing, a subtle art where catchers use their body and glove to try making borderline pitches look like strikes. Framing has become a critical skill for big league catchers, and there was concern that full-blown ABS would make some strong defensive catchers obsolete, although the practice is not universally popular.“The idea that people get paid for cheating, for stealing strikes, for moving a pitch that’s not a strike into the zone to fool the official and make it a strike is beyond my comprehension,” former manager Bobby Valentine said.Texas manager Bruce Bochy, a big league catcher from 1978-87, maintained old-school umpires such as Bruce Froemming and Billy Williams never would have accepted pitch framing. He said they would have told him: “‘If you do that again, you’ll never get a strike.’ I’m cutting out some words.”MLB’s competition committee includes team executives as well as players such as Arizona’s Corbin Burnes and Cal Raleigh, who leads the majors in home runs this season.Explore more on these topicsMLBBaseballUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

At Bethpage, they are flogging 24-carat gold coins – 100 were available on Tuesday morning, presumably still are now – with Keegan Bradley’s signature attached. The price? $7,500 (£5,500). There must be an assumptionRyder Cupfans leave their senses at the gates.Money. The one subject the US Ryder Cup team would rather is not discussed this week and thetheme that Europe are more than happy to promote. As soon as it was confirmed the US team members would be paid $500,000 a head to play at Bethpage – $300,000 must be given to charity, the rest is a stipend – half of Luke Donald’s team talk was written. Europe play for their cause, their tour, their big picture. The US? Now quite easily portrayed as obsessed with dollar signs. Twelve players, $2.4m, zero caveats.‘I’m starting to get jealous’: Shane Lowry on McIlroy, ambition and the Ryder CupRead moreLast week, the Guardian contacted the representatives of all dozen US players to ascertain whether the “extra” $200,000 would also be donated to a charitable cause. Only one saw fit to reply, Patrick Cantlay’s representative explaining his client’s desire to assist “educational development for children of military veterans and first responders”. Cantlay spoke directly on the same theme on Tuesday morning. It is curious given the obvious optics of this situation that agents have no apparent desire to publicly manage the subject.Bradley has confirmed all of his $500,000 will go to charity. Xander Schauffele plans the same. So, too, doesScottie Scheffleralbeit the world No 1 was irritated to be asked about his approach here. “I don’t know if we’ve met before,” Scheffler said to his questioner in what is now a regular, passive‑aggressive tone. “But my wife and I, we like to do a lot of stuff in our local community and I’ve never been one to announce what we do. I don’t like to give charitable dollars for some kind of recognition.“We have something planned for the money that we’ll be receiving. I think it’s a really cool thing that the PGA of America has empowered us to do. I have a deep passion for the city of Dallas, I have a deep passion for the organisations that we support at home and I’m excited to be able to take this money and be able to do some good in our local community.”Beyond this small contingent of players, it is totally unclear where the funds will go. The weird lack of focus from the American media means it would be perfectly easy for golfers to spend their $200,000 on fast cars or living room furniture. Stranger still is that $200,000 represents chump change to the world’s leading golfers.Had the overriding idea been to increaseRyder Cupcharitable contributions, or even for players to choose specific causes, there was nothing to stop $500,000 per player being designated accordingly. Instead, there is ambiguity and the chance for Europe to go one‑up in the eyes of a watching public.View image in fullscreenLuke Donald, the Europe captain, has proudly pointed out that his team will donate their payments to charity.Photograph: Mike Egerton/PAThe European team, it must be recognised, are no paupers. If he has not done already, Donald will soon make hundreds of thousands from speeches at leadership seminars. Golfers are typically given bonuses from their sponsors for Ryder Cup participation. The sweaters Team Europe will wear at Bethpage retail for about £2,000.Donald, though, understandably plays on the sense of moral high ground. He had given the European team the option of receiving payment, one that was universally rejected. “I was very proud of the guys,” Europe’s captain said. “The ideals of the Ryder Cup was set up back in the 1920s by Samuel Ryder and I think he would have been proud, too.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

There is, however, the possibility of Bethpage being closed to spectators for at least part of Thursday.While weather for tournament days on Long Island is currently predicted as reasonable, Thursday is problematic. The PGA of America reacted to that situation on Tuesday afternoon. In a statement, they said: “Due to the forecast of inclement weather on Thursday, September 25, the Ryder Cup opening ceremony has been moved to Wednesday, September 24. The opening ceremony pre-show will begin at 3 pm with the opening ceremony set for 4 pm.“Ryder Cup+ ticket holders for Thursday will now be admitted both Wednesday and Thursday.“US captain Keegan Bradley and European captain Luke Donald will announce Friday morning's pairings as planned at 4 pm Thursday at a location to be determined.”Ewan MurrayWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Bradley portrays the financial issue as one aimed at bringing the Ryder Cup into the 21st century. Nobody knows what sporting event he is using by way of comparison. It is safe to say the PGA of America’s officials did not decide one morning to bestow millions of dollars on players. Instead, the impetus came from the golfers themselves.“I’m not concerned about what Europe does or what they think,” Bradley said. “I’m concerned about what my team is doing. I was tasked with a job the PGA of America asked me to do and this was what we decided. We copied a lot of what the Presidents Cup does.“We did the best we could and I think a lot of good is going to come from this. I think the players are going to do a lot of good with this money and I think it’s great.”Bradley may well be right.

One thing is certain. We have a powerful shortlist here. The competition is generational. But this is also the elite, the god tier. And as ever there must be a winner.Was it the first nauseating thing at the Théâtre du Châtelet; the crowd of otherwise normal Parisians transformed into fame‑zombies, thronged against the barriers four hours before the ceremony, whooping and gawping as bored-looking blokes moved broadcast boxes around, baying at passing female TV presenters, spectating the buildup to an awards do in a state of celebrity delirium?Ousmane Dembélé and Aitana Bonmatí land Ballon d’Or awards as England duo honouredRead moreOr was the most nauseating thing the pre-ceremony outrage in the French media, who railed at thissoiree de foliebecause Paris Saint‑Germain had to play an actual football match the same evening, postponed from Sunday because of storms, rather than being present at a fancy party, a state of fomo that seems a little at odds with the new humble non-ego PSG.Was it just the wider phenomenon, the sense of some peak moment of personality cult, the confusion of talent with virtue, the superhero-ising of people who just happen to be very good at sport? Or is it the way awards culture coincides perfectly with the model that football’s owners want to impose, the move towards names, brands, individualism, that are so much easier to buy and sell than the old anchor points of place, culture and badge-loyalty?See for example Fifa’s Club World Cup. See also the newest award on Monday night, the team action prize. The title suggests some vision of collectivism and humility; in reality this was basically the words “Yamal”, “Messi”, “Mbappé”, “Brazil” and “PSG” and an online shortlist that reads like the most cynically engineered act of SEO catnip. Reading it you wondered why “Britney Spears”, “What Time Is It Now” and “Dogging sites in Kent where are” weren’t also up for gongs.Maybe it was the funny stuff at the ceremony that stood out. Early on a multilingual sexy singer appeared and sang a multilingual sexy song which seemed at one point to be actually called Multilingual Sexy. To be fair, this was also just very French. And Charlotte Cardin, who is Canadian, was great, creating energy out of nothing on an empty stage.View image in fullscreenHannah Hampton of Chelsea (right), fellow award-winner Gianluigi Donnarumma of Manchester City (left) and Gianluigi Buffon.Photograph: Benoît Tessier/ReutersSo that was one good bit. As was the sight of that iconic duo DJ Snake and Javier Pastore wandering on stage so that Javier could give a really earnest meandering speech while Snake stood next to him looking cool. Snake eventually did some PSG rabble-rousing before having to announce, to his own obvious battlement, that actually Arsenal Women had won team of the year, because in fact this isn’t just a PSG-hype event. The crowd booed the Arsenal players. Snake snuck back to his snug. Mainly you felt gutted for Snake. Don’t do Snake like that.Or maybe it was all of these things. Maybe everything was equally nauseating and everyone gets to be a winner. Except, of course, this is never the full story. This is what happens with elite modern football. Just when you think you’re done with the whole thing, just when it seems to have entered the arena of the unreal, that’s then football will pull you back in, like the serial adulterer narco don husband who buys you supermarket flowers and saysNoreen I’m still the man you fell in love with,and dammit he’s right. Stop it football. Stop re-seducing me.There were a few things that did this. Sarina Wiegman: yes, a good football person. Gianluigi Buffon beaming as Hannah Hampton got her award, like a goalkeeping Gandalf. Mainly, though, the thing that did this was Ousmane Dembélé winning the men’s Ballon d’Or, the most hyped award of the night.5:48'I wasn't planning on crying': Ousmane Dembélé and Aitana ­Bonmatí win Ballon d’Or awards – videoThis is the same Dembélé who plays for a state project. And the same Dembélé whose Ballon d’Or captures the beauty of that enduring paradox, the way football continues to house irresistibly relatable human qualities no matter how you stretch it thin or inject it with toxins. Here we have not just a wonderful footballer but an uplifting human story, embodied in a nice man who just happens also to have had a brilliant year in a brilliant team. And yes, football, we’re back on. For now.There is a trap here, too. Don’t go too far. Don’t go Full L’Équipe. Don’t make out Dembélé is both Football Jesus and a one‑man tactical “school” because he did a lot of high-speed pressing. Don’t talk too much about the “fulfilment of a tortuous destiny” which shows that “all stories are possible”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It’s not Ousmane versus the machine, or a case of Agent Dembélé, as online Real Madrid avatars have been quick to crow, the ruinously expensive underperformer who has now seen off the La Masia golden child. The world must always be binary, and Lamine Yamal has been unavoidably part of Dembélé’s triumph. There is something genuinely galling about the post‑ceremony online outrage, the idea this preternaturally talented 18‑year‑old, already enriched beyond reason, fawned over by adults, wheeled around in his bath chair like a golden princeling, is in some way being victimised by not having another gong forced into his hands.The fact is Lamine Yamal is also an underdog story, a kid from humble origins with nothing but talent to carry him. He is already, on pure brain-melting talent, the best player in the world. He will go on to win loads of these things. But he would also have been the youngest winner by three years. When the reigning holder of that mark won it, the original Ronaldo, he had just scored 47 goals in a season for Barcelona and 15 in the year for Brazil. And yes the counter to this is that no other player makes you feel like Lamine Yamal, that he is an extraordinary avatar of individualism in a systems-dominated game.View image in fullscreenLamine Yamal is also an underdog story, a kid from humble origins with nothing but talent to carry him.Photograph: Mickael Pinta/Zuma Press Wire/ShutterstockBut this also doesn’t stop Dembélé being the right winner of the Ballon d’Or and in a way that is not just logical but also redemptive. Dembélé is also a victory for feeling. Like Lamine Yamal he is an exhilarating footballer, blessed with rare technique, a scorer of brilliant goals, and now the dominant attacking presence in PSG’s trans-European treble.He has done this late in his football life, and done it when he really didn’t have to. A year ago he was out of the PSG team. Three years ago he was being hauled off in a World Cup final after a devastatingly bad 40 minutes. At Barcelona there was a meanness in his characterisation as lazy, disorganised, a junk food product, surrounded by feckless street-kid friends. In this context, the brilliance of his turnaround is that it is born out of hard work, team play, wildly committed pressing and tactical intelligence. It’s a victory for good management. And also for people getting on with each other, for turning the manager who dropped him after a row into the manager who has transformed his professional existence.Dembélé’s Ballon d’Or says: nothing is set, that it is still possible to reach out into the corners of your own talent. And it is also possible to do this if, like Dembélé, you’re not a conventional alpha sport-dog but someone who has known doubt and uncertainty, who is notoriously wry and funny rather than loud and flash. At the end of which we have a 28‑year‑old man crying at a podium, hugging his mum, showing vulnerability in his moment of straight-line triumph. And doing it all in the middle of the most cynically overmarketed festival of nausea.Dembélé may or may not be back on that stage, may still be part of aQatari projectin the most gerrymandered league in Europe. But he may also be enough to make you fall back in love, just a little, with this wildly alienating, oddly human sport‑industrial complex.Explore more on these topicsBallon d'OrParis Saint-GermaincommentShareReuse this content"

Detroit scored on drives of 98 and 96 yards against a Baltimore front that was without defensive lineman Nnamdi Madubuike and showed little ability to handle the Lions physically up front.“To get seven sacks [against Jackson] is insane, hats off to our defense,” said Lions receiver Amon-Ra St Brown after the game.Need a first down? Call St. Brown 📞#DETvsBAL📺 ESPN/ABCpic.twitter.com/kGlpbsZWpB— Detroit Lions (@Lions)September 23, 2025Up 31-24 at the two-minute warning, Detroit converted on fourth-and-two from their own 49 when Jared Goff completed a 21-yard pass to St Brown. Then Montgomery raced for a 31-yard touchdown with 1:42 to play, capping a 151-yard night for the running back.For just one game Caleb Williams finally gave the long-suffering Bears hopeRead moreJackson threw his third touchdown pass of the night, a 27-yarder to Mark Andrews with 29 seconds remaining. A failed two-point conversion and a failed onside kick later, the Lions could kneel out the clock.It was a jarring sight to see the Ravens (1-2) pushed around on their home field, where they lost for only the fourth time in 26 primetime games under coach John Harbaugh. When Gibbs and Montgomery weren’t running through the Baltimore defense, Goff had plenty of time to pick the Ravens apart as Detroit methodically advanced down the field. Goff completed 20 of 28 passes for 202 yards and a touchdown.“We did exactly what we wanted to do, sustained long drives,” said Goff of his offense.With the score tied at 21-21, the Lions faced fourth-and-one from the Baltimore four-yard line on the first play of the fourth quarter. St Brown took the ball on what initially looked like a jet sweep, then pitched it back to Gibbs, who scored easily.Step 1: Hand it to Amon-Ra ✅Step 2: Pitch it to Jah ✅Step 3: Hit the TD celly ✅pic.twitter.com/GlZiAL13zy— Detroit Lions (@Lions)September 23, 2025After a field goal made it 28-24, the Ravens got a defensive stop, but Derrick Henry lost a fumble in a huge fourth-quarter spot for the second time in three weeks, giving Detroit the ball at the Baltimore 16. Still, the Lions couldn’t put the game away, settling for a field goal when that drive was derailed by a facemask penalty on Christian Mahogany. But the Ravens couldn’t move the ball and punted on fourth-and-nine. Then Montgomery made it a 14-point game.Henry said he had apologized to his team for his fumble. “It’s just crazy,” Henry said. “Three fumbles [in three games] straight. I’m trying every day to fix the problem that just keeps occurring. I’m my worst critic, so I’m not going to try to beat myself up too much. But it’s hard not to when it’s consecutive and consistent [examples] of me doing the same thing.”The game started as advertised, with the Lions – fresh off a 52-point performance against Chicago – breezing down the field for an early 7-0 lead on a one-yard run by Gibbs. Then the Ravens – who reached 40 points in each of their first two games — quickly tied it on a 28-yard touchdown run by Henry.The Lions then retook the lead on a one-yard touchdown run by Montgomery, which capped an 18-play, 98-yard drive that took 10:48 off the clock. The Ravens, down two of their top pass rushers with Madubuike (neck) and Kyle Van Noy (hamstring) out, did little to trouble Goff in the pocket.Baltimore wasted a second-and-goal situation from the one-yard line later in the second quarter when Henry was stopped twice. On fourth-and-goal from the two-yard line, Jackson fumbled and the ball rolled all the way back to the 20, but when the Lions took over there, Baltimore’s defense held, and Jackson threw a three-yard touchdown pass to Rashod Bateman to tie it at 14-14 with 24 seconds left in the half.Baltimore took a 21-14 lead when Jackson threaded a 14-yard scoring pass to Mark Andrews in the third quarter, but Goff answered with an 18-yard touchdown strike to St Brown.Explore more on these topicsNFLDetroit LionsBaltimore RavensUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

Filip Jörgensen, the goalkeeper who came in after Robert Sánchez’s red card at Old Trafford, again struggled to dominate his area.Maresca said: “We knew already, we were aware, the game that we expect in terms of long balls, duels, throw‑ins, every time inside the box. I know that some of [my players], they didn’t play this kind of game [before]. I asked today, how many of them had played against League One teams. Then you know you need to play a different kind of game.”Asked if he had been obliged to deliver some harsh words to his players, he replied: “Absolutely, absolutely. And sometimes it’s more about desire … and we struggle. But if the next game is away to a League One or a League Two side, we need these experiences.”It was not rocket science. Lincoln’s predilection for a set-piece was signalled from the off. Receiving the kick-off, Freddie Draper, a Chelsea fan, teed the ball up with his first touch before volleying a veritable up-and-under to force the first of two long throw-ins. From the second hurled in by Tom Hamer, Chelsea only half-cleared, and Lewis Montsma cracked a near-perfect shot against the post.View image in fullscreenLincoln City’s Rob Street (right) opened the scoring for the League One side before Chelsea’s two goals soon after half-time.Photograph: Nigel French/PAThe stage was set. Lincoln, surging into third place in League One after a run of only one defeat in 12 games in all competitions this season, had nothing to lose; Chelsea, the club world champions, everything. Even with this much-changed lineup, the London club should have had too much for your average League One promotion hopefuls. But Lincoln are anything but average.Skubala’s team evidently believed in their game-plan. The club are still renowned for their run to the FA Cup quarter-finals nine seasons ago and showed that same underdog spirit in the first half here.The goal came from Lincoln’s ninth shot at goal, compared with Chelsea’s two at this stage. And while the breakthrough reflected Lincoln’s tactically timed ability to press, it also spoke of Chelsea’s carelessness.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Ivan Varfolomeev pounced to beat Trevoh Chalobah to the bouncing ball and fed Street, who composed himself to fire home. “To score in a game like this, against the world champions, is the stuff of dreams,” he said.“I’m really proud of the way the lads went about their work,” Skubala, the Lincoln head coach, said. “I’m really pleased with the first half and it could have been more than 1-0.

Gómez, signed from Inter Miami in January, struck Brighton's early opener and followed up with two spectacular efforts – a blistering shot into the roof of the net and a 30-yard volley over Barnsley keeper Murphy Coopers.The Paraguay midfielder (pictured) then slid home his fourth goal in the second half, with substitutes Harry Howell and Yasin Ayari also on target late in the game as Fabian Hürzeler’s side hit six for the second Carabao Cup game in a row, having beaten Oxford 6-0 in the third round.Cardiff Citywon 2-1 atBurnleyto reach the fourth round for the first time since reaching the final in 2012.

The manager provided a pithy reply when asked about his side’s lack of the ball in the buildup to their Carabao Cup third-round tie away to Huddersfield on Wednesday.Pep Guardiola is leading a strangely defensive new approach to the Premier LeagueRead more“When we defend deeper it is because the other [team] are better or we are shit,” Guardiola said. “I prefer us to regain the ball high up the pitch, [have] a lot of possession to disturb the structure of the opponents and try to punish them. It’s always been like that and always will be like that. If it doesn’t happen it is because we were bad, not because we want to [be defensive].“When I started as a footballer under Johan Cruyff, when a team went man-to-man he would say: ‘Pep, when you have the ball as a holding midfielder, look at Romário, look up front,’ so why should we [City] go shorter if that guy is being marked and this guy is being marked? If you [the opposition] want to play one against one with Erling [Haaland] then play one against one. If you lose that duel, it will be a goal.” Haaland scored City’s goal against Arsenal after a stunning counterattacking surge.Pressed further on how City set up at the weekend, Guardiola again provided a somewhat sarcastic response. “When we won the Premier League we were a boring team, right? So that’s why I said: ‘OK, I’m going to make more counterattacks this season,’” he said.“Maybe the players in the future can talk about how much I’ve changed this season. You can ask them – I think it’s completely the same.”He continued in the same vein with dismissive rhetorical questions. “For example, we changed the way we played against Napoli? Three days later we changed our way of playing? I changed absolutely everything in three days. I must be a really, really good manager.”Guardiola will start James Trafford as the goalkeeper for City’s Carabao Cup trip to against Huddersfield, bringing the 22-year-old back in goal after he had been displaced by Gianluigi Donnarumma. Abdukodir Khusanov is out for three games because of a foot problem the 21-year-old defender sustained at Arsenal. Kalvin Phillips was also in line to feature at Huddersfield but now will not do so because his partner is giving birth. “He’s in London because he will be a father for the second time,” Guardiola said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Levy left the board suddenly this month after 25 years as the club’s most senior director and has been replaced by Peter Charrington, a long-time adviser of the Lewis family who own ENIC, as non-executive chairman.Tottenham subsequently announced that they had rejected two preliminary expressions of interest in buying the club from Amanda Staveley’s PCP Capital Partners and an American/Chinese consortium led by Roger Kennedy and Firehawk Holdings Limited. Under takeover panel rules the club remain under the official offer period until 5 October, by which point PCP and the consortium must either make a formal offer for the club or announce they have no plans to do so.The takeover panel could compel the Ashcrofts to announce they are working together if there is evidence they are doing so. The takeover code states there is no presumption that family members with shares in the same company are acting in concert, but that they will be treated as doing so if there is evidence they are co-ordinating their shareholdings. Tottenham declined to comment.Andrew Ashcroft was based in Belize, where he owns a hotel and his father has substantial business interests, until 2021 when his then partner Jasmine Hartin was charged with manslaughter after accidentally shooting a police officer. Hartin was spared prison after pleading guilty, but Ashcroft obtained custody of their two children and moved to the Turks and Caicos Islands to launch a new business venture.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It is brilliant. It is what football was always designed to be … if you dream and you do things well, then you can reach the absolute pinnacle of whatever endeavour you’re in.”Forest supporters have travelled in their thousands to Spain – officially, Forest have 3,385 tickets – to witness their return to Europe, some of whom likely saw the club win the European Cup in 1979 and 1980.“I said it when I was at Celtic too, when a club’s got a couple of stars on its badges, it’s special,” the Australian said. “Because you only earn them one way, and that is by winning a European Cup or a Champions League. You literally can’t buy that. You have to earn that.“I think when you carry something like that on your shirt, you can tap into it, because it shows you that there’s the possibility of success if you dream of it and work hard for it. When you go out there, you’re representing not just today’s fans and today’s players, but also those in the past that have got you to where you are today.”Almost the entire Forest squad have travelled to Seville, including the ineligible record signing, Omari Hutchinson, who was omitted from the 22-man squad submitted by Postecoglou’s predecessor, Nuno Espírito Santo.Oleksandr Zinchenko, originally left out by Forest, has replaced Ola Aina in the squad after the club applied to Uefa given the Nigeria full-back is sidelined for three months.

However, the German publication Bild reported on Monday that Kane has a £56.7m release clause which could be activated next summer.Lord Ashcroft’s son Andrew buys 3.4% stake worth £100m in TottenhamRead moreIt is believed Spurs do have a buy-back option on the England captain and Frank would be happy to work with the “top player” in the future. “I didn’t know there was a clause,” Frank said. “He is an unbelievable player who did fantastic for Spurs and is doing fantastic for Bayern. Top player. I think there’s a lot of Tottenham fans, including myself, who would like to see Kane back.“Personally, I don’t think he will do it right now if I’m honest. He’ll probably stay in Bayern and continue performing well. He was top scorer last year, won the championship and he’s doing fantastic now.“I don’t know what he’s thinking. Myself, I’m a traveller, I like to travel, I like to explore things as well. He’s been here for many years so why not enjoy the time at Bayern a little bit more? But he’s welcome. If he wants to join us, he’s more than welcome!”Frank’s immediate focus is the visit of Doncaster on Wednesday in the Carabao Cup third round where Spurs youngsters aspiring to be the next Kane could get an opportunity. The highly rated attacker Luca Williams-Barnett has impressed this season and struck a hat-trick for the under-21s in the victory against Leicester on Friday.Asked on Tuesday about the 16-year-old, Frank hinted at a potential place on the bench. “Of course he’s trained with us, Luca, a few times.

While the Arsenal manager insisted he had not heard their criticism, Arteta was adamant that his team put in a positive performance against City despite slipping five points behind the early leaders Liverpool.“I would be extremely surprised with my knowledge and my knowhow and how I analyse a football game,” he said. “Because it was impossible for somebody to predict such dominance from Arsenal through 96 minutes because it never happened in 17 years of Pep as a manager.“So if the narrative goes somewhere else, and we talk about dominance, about something else, how can you be dominant against such a team if you have ... what was the word that was used? Handbrake. Dominance and handbrake, they are two different words. But I accept everything. I will learn more to have a different vision.”View image in fullscreenNoni Madueke could miss two months after sustaining a knee injury in the draw on Sunday.Photograph: Kin Cheung/APAsked about his decision not to select the new £67.5m signing Eze, who came off the bench to set up Martinelli’s equaliser but also started in the wins against Nottingham Forest and Athletic Bilbao, Arteta said: “Could he play 90 minutes? That’s a question I put for myself because none of you know the load that he can do. So it’s easy to say he could have played from the start. Maybe not. Because he already played two games from the start. And he’s never played as a right attacking midfielder in his field. So that’s another one. A new element for him. But all good.”Arteta confirmed that Noni Madueke is likely to be out for several weeks after sustaining a knee injury against City, with the England forward expected to have more tests in the coming days. There was more bad news with the new signing Piero Hincapié having been ruled out of the Carabao Cup tie against Port Vale on Wednesday with a groin strain, while Arteta also revealed that Kai Havertz is expected to be out for months as he recovers from a knee injury.“Maybe something to look at more in-depth, and we absolutely did that,” Arteta said of the number of injuries Arsenal have endured in the past 12 months. “Try to keep that as low as possible. That’s what we are trying to do.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I don’t think you can dwell on it because you have to be in the moment, you have to play the game in front of you, you can’t think about what happened three years ago. You have to be focused on what is ahead.”The back-row Sadia Kabeya added that she sees this final as a “completely new page” after being relatively new to the Red Roses squad in 2022, having won her first England cap in late 2021. “For me it was a weird one because I hadn’t played much in that World Cup,” Kabeya, who also came off the bench in the last final, said. “Injury brought me into the semi-final and the final and I was there to put the squad in the best place. The fact I was playing in the final was amazing but it was never in my plans. I just wanted to put my best foot forward.“When we did end up losing in that final, it didn’t hit me as much because of being new and not knowing as much about the history; I didn’t have that weight. Looking back, there are a lot of girls who have a lot of feelings about that final. I think because I was so young and new into it, it was a loss but not as monumental as it was for the other girls.“This time around there is a lot more in it for me, especially being more cemented in the squad and really connected with the girls. There are a lot of learnings but, for me, it’s a completely new page.”This week is big because it is a final but it is also being hosted at a sold-out Twickenham and it is expected to be aew attendance recordfor a women’s rugby union game.

Knowing that the majority of fans there are there to support them, to galvanise them and get behind them. I know you feed off of that energy, especially knowing what this game is going to be. It’s a cliche but they almost become the 16th person in those moments where you need them.

A run quicker than Australia during this period, albeit yet to win a major five-Test series, that figure is also a historical outlier among all nations.But perhaps the greater difference compared to recent Ashes tours is the presence of five seamers capable of hitting 90mph on the speed gun. Gus Atkinson, Jofra Archer, Brydon Carse and Josh Tongue are all named after featuring in the2-2 draw with India, with Mark Wood – arguably the quickest in the world – fit again after knee surgery in March.England have taken fast bowlers to Australia before, of course, a lineage that includes players such asHarold Larwood, Frank Tyson and Fred Trueman, or Andrew Flintoff and Steve Harmison more recently. Notwithstanding the lack of ball‑tracking before 2006, a quintet of such quicks this time around feels unprecedented, even if much will hinge on their fitness.Quick GuideEngland men's squadsShowEngland Men’s Test Squad (16 players):Ben Stokes (c), Jofra Archer, Gus Atkinson, Shoaib Bashir, Jacob Bethell, Harry Brook (vc), Brydon Carse, Zak Crawley, Ben Duckett, Will Jacks, Ollie Pope, Matthew Potts, Joe Root, Jamie Smith, Josh Tongue, Mark WoodEngland Men’s ODI Squad v New Zealand:Harry Brook (c), Rehan Ahmed, Jofra Archer, Sonny Baker, Tom Banton, Jacob Bethell, Jos Buttler, Brydon Carse, Sam Curran, Liam Dawson, Ben Duckett, Jamie Overton, Adil Rashid, Joe Root, Jamie Smith, Luke WoodEngland Men’s IT20 Squad v New Zealand:Harry Brook (c), Rehan Ahmed, Sonny Baker, Tom Banton, Jacob Bethell, Jos Buttler, Brydon Carse, Jordan Cox, Zak Crawley, Sam Curran, Liam Dawson, Jamie Overton, Adil Rashid, Phil Salt, Luke WoodWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Nine-day breaks after both the first and second Tests offer scope for recovery but rotation is also likely. As flagged previously, Matthew Potts has been included as an extra seamer, offering a more robust, fast-medium option. Chris Woakes was not considered for selection afterdislocating his shoulderduring the fifth Test against India.Markedly different to the side under Andrew Strauss thatlast won an away Ashes series in 2010‑11– more aggressive with the bat, less thrifty with the ball – there is growing optimism that this is England’s best chance since. Though an all-conquering side in recent times, defeat by South Africain the World Test Championship final this yearhinted at Australia’s vulnerability.Central to England’s chances of seizing on this possibility is the role Stokes can perform. The 34‑year‑old reannounced himself as a genuine Test all-rounder this summer – his best with the ball to date – but still ended it watching from the sidelines with a torn shoulder muscle. As per England’s press release, “he remains on track” for the start of the tour.View image in fullscreenJofra Archer (centre) will embark on his first away Ashes tour.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianWhile his place in English folklore was secured in 2019 – theWorld Cup finaland the famous Headingley Test – Stokes has unfinished business in Australia. After a promising debut there in 2013-14, he missed the4-0 defeat in 2017-18for legal reasons and had only recently returned from a mental health break for the pandemic-blighted defeat in 2021-22.Key, the team director, is due to explain the rationale behind the final spots on Wednesday, not least Jacks returning for the first time sincehis debut in Pakistan in 2022. Rehan Ahmed was one option, while Liam Dawson stood in for Bashir during the summer. Both have to settle for spots on the preceding white-ball tour of New Zealand in October.A more delicate subject will be Pope, who has been vice‑captain for three years and stood in for Stokes on five occasions, winning three matches.Brendon McCullum, the England head coach, hinted at a switch recently, highlighting Brook’s role as captain of the limited‑over sides and stressing that, even without an official title, every player can still act as a leader.However, after Pope experienced another frustrating series against India – a century to begin with, an average of 34 overall – the change may also suggest his spot is no longer a given. Bethell has the back-foot game for Australia, impressed in New Zealand last year,and made his maiden centuryat professional level in the recent ODI series with South Africa.This may be considered a so‑called “good headache” to have, with the batting lineup otherwise settled and pegged around the all‑time greatness of Joe Root. Beyond how many of the five Tests Archer and Wood can play – this will be the former’s first away Ashes tour – the biggest question mark is arguably the spinner, with Bashir still a work in progress.Quick Guide'I found out in 45 seconds': Kate Cross loses England contractShowEngland bowler Kate Cross has lost her central contract with the national team, saying her appraisal was a 'pretty savage day'.The 33-year-old has led England's seam attack since the retirement of Katherine Sciver-Brunt in 2023, but Cross (pictured) said she discovered 'within 45 seconds' of her appraisal last month that her contract was not being renewed.'I had gone in there armed with a lot of my stats and stuff to talk about and I didn't open my book, I didn't get a chance to,\" Cross told the BBC's No Balls podcast.'I thought how am I going to get through the appraisal without crying and then I had cried it out and got in there and within 45 seconds, I found out I wasn't getting my contract renewed so it all happened really quickly. It was a pretty savage day.'Lancashire and Northern Superchargers bowler Cross made her England debut in 2013, playing eight Tests, 76 ODIs and 18 T20s and taking 140 wickets.PA MediaPhotograph: Jason Cairnduff/X03805Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.The 21-year-old was identified for this tour two years ago, with his height and overspin, plus the footmarks created by Mitchell Starc, and deemed the closest to Nathan Lyon in terms of approach. But from 19 Tests of investment since there have been lurching returns, with Bashir claiming 68 wickets – includingfour five‑wicket hauls– but at 39 runs apiece.Even with uncertainty over their top three, Australia will doubtless look to target Bashir and force England’s seamers into bowling more overs. For the first time in a long time, however, those seamers will be coming in fast.Explore more on these topicsThe AshesEngland cricket teamAustralia cricket teamCricketAustralia sportnewsShareReuse this content"

There was more discussion over possible rule changes at a meeting in central London on Tuesday, but there is, as of yet, no time frame for putting them to a vote and the chances that anything will be adopted before next season are receding.Sources suggest discussions at the meeting on Tuesday were focused on addressing issues raised by individual clubs, with perspectives often diverging according to a club’s position within the competition. One of the two proposals, known as the squad-cost ratio, would limit spending on wages to 85% of revenue. Nine of the league’s 20 clubs are already committed to such a system as a result of qualifying for Europe and are understood to value the flexibility PSR provides domestically.The second proposal, known as anchoring, would limit spending for all clubs to a multiple of the revenues of the bottom-placed side. It has provoked further dissent, with Manchester United and Manchester City among the clubs to have voted against such plans in the past. The case for the rules was made again, with clubs in favour arguing anchoring could be key to maintaining the league’s competitive balance, seen as one of the selling points for the competition at home and abroad.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.The Pixel 10 Pro XL is the largest slab phone Google makes and is one of the biggest available in Europe and the US. It costs £1,199 (€1,299/$1,199/A$1,999), sitting above itssmaller sibling the Pixel 10 Proand below the upcoming folding Pixel 10 Pro Fold, and competing directly with Apple’s iPhone 17 Pro Max andSamsung’s Galaxy S25 Ultra.The 10 Pro XL is almost identical on the outside tothe 9 Pro XLit replaces in terms of dimensions but with 11g of additional weight. It is a big, heavy phone that requires two hands to use most of the time and benefits from a phone grip or handle.View image in fullscreenThe Pixel has a ring of magnets to attach any number of Qi2 or MagSafe accessories to the back including phone grips, such as the Popsocket, as well as car mounts, wallets, stands and batteries.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianIt has a huge, bright and smooth OLED screen, which is one of the very best and excellent for watching TV and films. The back hides Qi2.2 wireless charging and magnetic accessory support, making it one of a very small number of phones that can charge at up to 25W using a new generation of wireless chargers.The 10 Pro XL has the same Google Tensor G5 chip as the rest of thePixel 10lineup andperforms just as well, feeling rapid in general use. It plays games just fine, but those wanting the best graphics and frame rates in high-end mobile games are better served by rivals with Qualcomm’s top Snapdragon chip, such as the S25 Ultra.The biggestPixelalso has the largest battery with the longest run time. The 10 Pro XL matches its predecessor, lasting about 52 hours between charges after a mix of usage across wifi and 5G. The phone should outlast even the heaviest of usage days, with most people probably needing to charge it every other day.View image in fullscreenThe phone takes less than 90 minutes to charge via cable or about two hours using a Qi2 25W wireless charger, such as theUgreen MagFlow 2-in-1(left) orBelkin UltraCharge Pro(right).Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianSpecificationsScreen:6.8in 120Hz QHD+ OLED (486ppi)Processor:Google Tensor G5RAM:16GBStorage:256, 512GB or 1TBOperating system:Android16Camera:50MP + 48MP UW + 48MP 5x tele; 42MP selfieConnectivity:5G, eSIM, wifi 7, UWB, NFC, Bluetooth 6 and GNSSWater resistance:IP68 (1.5m for 30 minutes)Dimensions:162.8 x 76.6 x 8.5mmWeight:232gAndroid 16 with AIView image in fullscreenMagic Cue is one of the most advanced AI features available, working silently in the background to produce helpful and timely information.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe 10 Pro XL has the same Android 16 software and AI features asthe 10 Pro, making it one of the most expressive and polished experiences available. Google will provide updatesuntil 2032.The Gemini chatbot is available throughout the system, and has its own stand-alone app that can see what is on your screen or through the camera to help. But the standout new feature is Magic Cue, which runs locally in the background as a proactive little helper presenting data from your calendar, emails, chats and other Google apps on your phone when you need it. It will pop up with the location of a restaurant when a friend texts about your dinner date or shows your order emails in the phone app when you ring a recognised business. It works great in Google’s various apps, and a handful of third-party ones, but not WhatsApp or other popular messaging apps yet.The 10 Pro XL also comes with a year’s subscription forGoogle AI Pro, for access to the company’s more powerful Gemini models, and 2TB of cloud storage for photos, files and email, worth £19 a month.CameraView image in fullscreenPoint and shoot with the 10 Pro XL and you are almost guaranteed a great shot regardless of the conditionsPhotograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe big Pixel has thesame camera system as the 10 Pro, meaning your choice is only about phone size not camera quality. The 50-megapixel main, 48MP ultra wide and 48MP 5x telephoto cameras are some of the very best you can get. Point and shoot with the 10 Pro XL and you are almost guaranteed a great shot regardless of the conditions.It also has a handful of helpful AI tools including: thenovel Camera Coach;Add Me, which blends two photos to put the photographer into group shots; andBest Take, which has now been made automatic. It helps get group shots where everyone is looking at the camera by shooting a photo when everyone is looking once you press the shutter button or blending multiple shots where needed.Finally, it has the Pro Res Zoom feature that kicks in when you push beyond 30x magnification and uses genAI to put the detail and sharpness back into images lost to digital zoom. It isn’t always perfect and is switched off when the system detects a person, but it can have remarkable results, making blurry 100x zoom images much clearer and more usable. But it is also not a true photo at that point, as it has been interpreted and remade by AI, and is labelled as such by the camera app usingC2PA content credentials.Overall, whether you use the AI tools or not, the Pixel has one of the very best camera systems on the market.SustainabilityView image in fullscreenThe ultrasonic fingerprint scanner under the screen is super fast and accurate, making unlocking the phone a breeze.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe batteryis rated to lastin excess of 1,000 full charge cycles with at least 80% of its original capacity.

If you like what Google’s beendoingwith 6.3insmartphonesbut want everything bigger, this is the model to get.The camera is one of the very best, the screen is great and the software, including Google’s most cutting-edge AI features, is top notch. The addition of Qi2.2 support speeds up wireless charging, but more helpfully opens up a world of magnetic accessories including grips to make the big phone easier to hold.The Pixel feels responsive but it isn’t a dramatic upgrade onlast year’s 9 Pro XL model. When it comes to raw power, particularly for games, the Pixel falls short against rivals such as the Samsung’s Galaxy S25 Ultra, which remainsthe superphone to beat.Pros:seven years of software updates, great camera with 5x and 10x optical magnification plus AI zoom, great big screen, Magic Cue and impressive local AI features, Qi2.2 wireless charging and magnetic accessory support, good battery life, great size, fast fingerprint and face recognition, 12 months of Google AI Pro included.Cons:very expensive, huge and heavy, face unlock option not as secure as Face ID, raw performance and battery life short of best-in-class, no physical Sim card slot in the US, not a massive upgrade.View image in fullscreenNote that the Pixel 10 Pro XL comes without a physical sim slot in the top of the phone in the US, relying entirely on eSims.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianExplore more on these topicsPixelGoogleAndroidSmartphonesMobile phonesAlphabetreviewsShareReuse this content"

For the first time, the rapture is playing out onTikTok.Believers have taken to the app to disclose their preparation for impending doom, claiming to havesold their carsor requested “eternity leave” from their employers, and fretting over whether thefamily doggets to come to heaven too. One womanadvisedher followers to do away with their phones’ password protections, so that any loved ones that get left behind can easily access their personal information. Anotherbought Biblesin bulk at Dollar Tree, which she planned to leave behind with personalized notes in hopes of saving some last-minute converts.Evangelical Christians who believe in the rapture describe it as a fundamental doctrine: the idea that one day, true believers of God will ascend into heaven, ending life as we know it – while the rest are left behind for a seven-year period of suffering at the hands of the antichrist.Political violence, economic concerns, disease ... these are very common tropes within apocalyptic textsMatthew GabrieleSince the theory was popularized in the early 1800s by a British clergyman named John Nelson Darby, there have been countless false alarms: in 1844, a New York farmer turned Baptist preacher named William Miller amassed thousands of followers through preaching a second coming that never materialized, in an event later dubbed the Great Disappointment. When Halley’s comet passed through the sky in 1910, scammers sold “anti-comet pills” intended to save souls. In 1997, the Hale-Bopp comet led 39 members of the Heaven’s Gate cult to die by mass suicide.This time around, the call came from the South African preacher Joshua Mhlakela, whospread the wordduring a June podcast appearance. “The rapture is upon us, whether you are ready or not,” Mhlakela said. The theory quickly translated to TikTok, where the hashtag #rapture has more than 320,000 posts.Tyler Huckabee is the managing editor atSojo.net, a progressive Christian publication, where he says the newsroom’s “joke of the day” is that deadlines have ceased to matter. “This is by no means my first rodeo in terms of a certain sect of Christian theology that starts the rumor about the end of the world, and that catching fire,” Huckabee said. “Facebook definitely had it, Twitter had it, but it’s TikTok’s first end of the world moment.”Rapture reports thrive during times of tumult, said Matthew Gabriele, a professor in the department of religion and culture at Virginia Tech who studies apocalyptic movements. “If you’re a believing Christian, you don’t know when this is going to happen per se, but you look for the signs,” Gabriele explained. “Usually when things are getting ‘really bad’, that’s when the elect will be saved. So it’s not a surprise that [people are predicting the rapture] in this particular moment, where there’s political violence, economic concerns, disease, etc – these are very common tropes within apocalyptic texts.”Indeed, the phrase “end times” is often thrown around on social media to describe our fractured,collapsing realityofplague-like pandemic, biblical-level natural disasters and mass violence. In the last week, believers have linkedCharlie Kirk’s assassination to the rapture theory: some on TikTok have suggested that Kirk, who in death became amartyrfor Christian nationalists and whose memorial serviceveeredinto religious revival territory, could beresurrectedduring the rapture.View image in fullscreenContent creator Jess Lauren on TikTok.Photograph: TikTok/@jesslauurenJess Lauren, a 27-year-old content creator who also runs a clothing startup, grew up “heavily involved” in the Christian church. Both of her parents were pastors. While attending the University of California, Davis, Lauren began to question her conservative, religious beliefs, joining the“deconstructing” movement– where former believers reconsider the dogma they accepted as children.As a kid, she believed in the rapture, especially after reading Left Behind, a blockbuster apocalyptic book series co-written by Tim LaHaye, a homophobic minister whobelievedin the Illuminati, and the Christian writer Jerry B Jenkins. (It was later adapted to film multiple times, including a 2014 version starring Nicolas Cage.) Lauren grew up as the youngest of four kids, meaning she rarely came home to an empty house. If she ever did, Lauren would head out on to the street to look for rapture survivors. “I’d be like, ‘OK, are there less people driving today? Have I been left behind?” she said.Ditto for April Ajoy, a podcaster and author of the memoir Star-Spangled Jesus: Leaving Christian Nationalism and Finding a True Faith. “When I was 13, I legitimately thought I’d been left behind because I was chatting on AOL instant messenger on our family computer, and the house got really quiet all of a sudden,” she said. “I started looking for my family, and I couldn’t find them anywhere. For about 20 minutes, I literally started prepping. I thought I was going to need to go to the military supply store, get food and go underground.Then my family came back – they’d just gone on a walk. That’s really traumatizing.”Ajoy would pray “that God would hold off” the rapture until she got older, so she could experience graduating high school, getting married and having sex for the first time. At the same time, she was excited for it. “We’re taught that it’s a get out of death free card,” said Ajoy. “You go straight to heaven, you don’t have to die, and you don’t live through the terrible things that happen on earth.”Rapture rumors typically amp up in September, Ajoy says, due to the Jewish holiday Rosh Hashanah, which is mentioned in the Bible. “But ultimately, I think any time people feel really out of control and scared, it’s prime time for them to start talking about the rapture,” she said.OnTikTok, the fear is not always so palpable. Many #RaptureTok posts fall into the breezy genre of quippy, conversational content that does well in the algorithm. Sara Reinis, a doctoral student at the University of Pennsylvania who studies religion and social media, has seen videos of moms sharing their end times prepping routines or giving tips for people who are left behind.“They’re adopting the language of self-help, which is so prevalent on social media, and attaching it to the rapture discussion,” she said. “Some don’t really know if this is when the rapture is going to happen, but they think it’s still an important wake-up call to pay attention to. They’re hedging their bets.”I grew up evangelical. Terrifying rapture films scarred me for everRead moreIt’s not just believers who have pulled up a chair to #RaptureTok. Outside religious circles, social media users areencouraginganyone who is giving away material goods in preparation to throw some cash their way. In one parodyvideo, a woman gives tips to people who are left behind, such as: “Stockpile VHS copies of Shrek. It’s now the new currency.” One X userpointed outthat 23 September is also Bisexual Visibility Day, meaning that if a “second coming” did happen, it would also be Jesus’s “coming out day”.So what will have changed if we wake up on Thursday? Huckabee, the Sojo.net editor, says that if past false flag raptures are any indicator, not much. People who go all-in on the rapture only to be proved wrong do not usually use it as an opportunity to reflect on their beliefs.“There’s a very human fear of saying ‘I was wrong,’” Huckabee said. “So what I’ve tended to see from the people who quit their job because they think Jesus is coming back, or whatever, it’s that they say they got something wrong – maybe the date was a bit off, but it’s still coming soon. There’s always a way to kick the ball down the road.”Explore more on these topicsTikTokChristianityReligionEvangelical ChristianityfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Trumps’s visa fees threaten tech’s most prized employeesThe president’s deal on visas could upend Silicon Valley, and will a TikTok purchase finally go through?Blake MontgomeryTue 23 Sep 2025 09.46 EDTLast modified on Tue 23 Sep 2025 09.48 EDTShareHello, welcome to TechScape. I’m writing to you from a plane back to a United States in uproar. This week’s tech news is all about Donald Trump’s deals: with China, with the UK, and with the US tech industry, which is facing steep fines for its favorite visa.Trump’s talent tariffs: Visa fines threaten tech’s most prized employeesUS tech giants made a bargain last year: tens of millions of dollars to Trump’s presidential campaign in exchange for access to the president and policies that promoted their industry’s growth. If you count inElon Musk, the number rises to hundreds of millions. However, Trump’s imposition of a new fee on a visa heavily used by tech threatens the compact.My colleague Johana Bhuiyan reports:Donald Trump signed a proclamation on Friday that would impose an annual $100,000 fee on H-1B visa applications, dealing a potentially major blow to the US tech industry, which relies more than any other sector of the US economy on immigrants who hold these visas.Trump’s threat to crack down on H-1B visas has become a major flashpoint with the tech industry. Roughly two-thirds of jobs secured through the H-1B program are computer-related, government figures show, but employers also use the visa to bring in engineers, educators and healthcare workers.After the initial report, Amazon, Microsoft and Google urged employees abroad to return to the US immediately and keep any dependents from traveling abroad. The consequences of the fee, which took effect at 12am on 21 September, were unclear, and their human resources departments were worried. The White House later clarified that the fee would only apply to new applicants, rather than burdening current visa holders with a yearly six-figure fee, and would not require $100,000 for reentry. The US commerce secretary had repeatedly saidon camerathe fee would be levied annually.The penalty threatens one nation’s immigrants enormously: India. Roughly 700,000 H-1B visa holders reside in the United States. Of those, 71% were born in India. In a distant second, Chinese immigrants make up between 10% and 15%. Other notable facts: nearly three-quarters of H-1B visa holders are men, and their median salary is about $120,000. The price of bringing these workers to US soil, should the penalty withstand inevitable court challenges, may be too high for their employers.‘Afraid of our talent’: India hits back against Trump’s H-1B visa fee hikeThe fee amounts to a tariff on talent, much like the president’s duties on goods from nearly all the US’s trading partners. The president is directing his propensity for protectionism towards specialized jobs the same way he did imports from Vietnam. And like those tariffs on goods, the logic of his employee fees is difficult to compute: The US has not built up the domestic manufacturing capacity to assemble smartphones from case to camera, so it does not follow that the president erects barriers to bringing in parts made elsewhere. Likewise, the US does not boast the robust pipelines training technical workers that India and China do. The gap leaves the US’ most successful companies with a shortage of workers they need to create their products and provide their services. Enter the H-1B. Supporters of the program, including Tesla CEO Elon Musk, say it brings in highly skilled workers essential to filling talent gaps and keeping firms competitive. Musk, himself a naturalized US citizen born in South Africa, once held an H-1B visa.In December of last year, Trump expressed his support for the program.“I have many H-1B visas on my properties. I’ve been a believer in H-1B. I have used it many times. It’s a great program,” the president told theNew York Post.Will Trump’s talent tariff encourage the American education system to produce more students with technical skills, as he hopes to reshore technical manufacturing? Perhaps not while he wages war on the nation’s universities, which train many of the international students who go on to hold H-1B visas and fuel American companies.Took long enough: Trump finally reaches a TikTok transfer dealView image in fullscreenWill the TikTok deal go through?Photograph: Dado Ruvić/ReutersAfter five years, one day ofTikTokitself going dark, and three extensions of the enforcement deadline, Trump says he has reached a deal to transfer TikTok from its Beijing-based parent company to an owner the US finds acceptable.“We have a deal on TikTok ... We have a group of very big companies that want to buy it,” Trump said last Tuesday, without providing further details.Since the initial vague announcement, we have learned some details. Trump said in an interview on Fox News on Sunday that media mogul Rupert Murdoch and his son Lachlan, the CEO of Fox Corporation could be part of deal. He said Michael Dell, the CEO of the computer maker Dell, was also involved.Oracle, owned by the man who dethroned Elon Musk as the richest person in the world, Larry Ellison, will lease and maintain TikTok’s proprietary algorithm, White House officials said Monday. The partnership expands on Oracle’s existing management of TikTok’s trove of data collected about its American users.The wider TechScapeDocuments offer rare insight on Ice’s close relationship with PalantirNvidia to invest $100bn in OpenAI, bringing the two AI firms togetherIf Anyone Builds it, Everyone Dies review – how AI could kill us allGoogle DeepMind claims ‘historic’ AI breakthrough in problem solvingMeta announces first Ray-Ban smart glasses with in-built augmented reality displayItaly first in EU to pass comprehensive law regulating use of AIAI could never replace my authors.

Starmer and Trump’s multibillion-dollar tech deal dwarfedView image in fullscreenTrump and Keir Starmer at Chequers, the country house of the prime minister, last week.Photograph: Evan Vucci/APKeir Starmer and Trump announced a week ago that a slew of US companies would invest £31bn in the UK’s tech sector over the next several years.Microsoft’s president, Brad Smith, hailed the “single biggest announcement” in the pact, £22bn over the next four years, half of which will go towards capital expenditures on AI and cloud services. Google also pledged to invest £5bn.CoreWeave, a US datacentre company, said it would invest a further £1.5bn in the UK including a site in North Lanarkshire, Scotland. The US software company Salesforce is investing an additional $2bn in the UK.Nvidia, the world’s biggest AI chipmaker, touted an £11bn injection into the UK economy as part of the pact, providing up to 120,000 of its powerful Blackwell GPUs to projects that will be built over the next couple of years in the UK.One notable critic lambasted the deal’s size as puny, dwarfed as it is by the US’s Project Stargate, in which commitments from tech companies amount to $500bn, or the joint US-UAE pledge to establish the world’s largest data center in Abu Dhabi. Governments need not even be involved for massive sums to change hands: Nvidia announced Monday that it would invest $100bn in OpenAI, more than three times the UK deal.Nick Clegg, former UK deputy prime minister and Meta’s former chief policymaker, said the deal was “sloppy seconds” for the UK from the US tech industry.Speaking at a Royal Television Society conference in Cambridge, Clegg said the relationship between the UK and the US tech sector was “all one-way traffic” and that the announcements suited the companies.He warned Britain was being “defanged” by simply fostering a greater reliance on the US tech sector, rather than building its own.“These companies need those infrastructure resources anyway,” he said. “They’re building datacentres all over the world. Maybe they were pushed a bit forward just to meet the timetable with this week’s state visit. But … it’s all one-way traffic.“We’re a kind of vassal state technologically, we really are.

Let’s not write her off as too young or too femaleTue 23 Sep 2025 12.07 EDTLast modified on Tue 23 Sep 2025 14.29 EDTShareQuiz time, and the category is American gerontocracy. Here goes: how many sitting Democratic members of Congress have died in office since November 2022? The answer is a mind-boggling eight. While Republicans aren’t dropping dead at the same rate, they’re arguably clinging to power for longer than is dignified. Last year, a Texas journalist discoveredKay Granger, a high-ranking octogenarian Republican congresswoman, had stopped coming to work because she was in a senior living facility, suffering from “dementia issues”. And while he is not in a facility yet, Donald Trump’snonsensical ramblings, including a recent weird and completely fictitious story abouthis uncle knowing the Unabomber, suggest he may be suffering some sort of issue with his mental acuity.I’m not trying to be ageist here (the older I get, the more worried I become about ageism). I’m simply setting the scene. Behold: the US is ruled by out-of-touch elites who would rather die at their desks than cede power to fresh blood. Meanwhile, many Americans are frustrated with thestatus quoand desperate for change. You can see this in the excitement around Zohran Mamdani, the incoming Democratic mayor of New York City – unless thebillionaire classcan pull off an upset. You can also see it in arecent pollthat found more than half of likely Democratic voters prefer socialism-aligned politicians such as Bernie Sanders (who, to be fair, is 84), Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (AOC) and Mamdani to establishment figures like Hakeem Jeffries, Nancy Pelosi and Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer.Ocasio-Cortez and her team can certainly see it, and they appear to be poised to seize this political moment. Rumours are swirling that the 35-year-old congresswoman is considering a run for president or the Senate in 2028. The latter move would probably mean facing off against Schumer, who is about as old-guard as you can get and hasnot yet endorsed Mamdani. If AOC beat him (whichpolls showis very plausible), it would be a massive shift for the future of the Democratic party. A presidential nomination, however, is obviously the real prize.The US doesn’t have a great record when it comes to rallying behind female presidential candidates. Is there really a chance that the first Madam President could come in the form of a millennial progressive?Ocasio-Cortez, whose charisma took her from obscurity to a household name in record speed, certainly should not be underestimated. Even Trump has expressed grudging admiration for the congresswoman. “She’s got a little spunk … a little something that’s good,” he toldFox News on Sunday, in reference to an Axios report about AOC’s ambitions. But he added: “I don’t think her philosophy can come close to winning.”Please don’t succumb to hopelessness over Palestine. Your voice can still make a difference | Arwa MahdawiRead moreIt’s not entirely clear, however, what AOC’s “philosophy” is these days. When a 28-year-old Ocasio-Cortezunseated longtime incumbentJoe Crowley in a New York primary election in 2018, she was unapologetically leftwing. “Working-class Americans want a clear champion and there is nothing radical about moral clarity in 2018,” she stated.Since then, the political machine has wrung some of that clarity out of the congresswoman. “AOC is just a regular Democrat now,” New York magazine lamented in a2023 piecethat charted what some of her base see as a shift to the centre. Last year shelost the endorsementof the national leadership of the Democratic Socialists of America because of her equivocation over Palestine.While AOC is one of the few US politicians to have termed the situation in Gaza a genocide, she has also disappointed many pro-Palestine progressives (including me) with her laundering of the Biden-Harris administration’s blank cheque to Israel. During herprimetime slotat the Democratic National Convention, for example (where no Palestinian Americans were invited to speak on the main stage), AOC repeated Kamala Harris’s refrain that she was “working tirelessly to secure a ceasefire in Gaza”. Which wasn’t entirely a lie: you’re not going to get tired when you’re doing absolutely nothing to stop a bloodbath, are you?But beggars can’t be choosers. There is no perfect saviour coming to rescue us from the hellscape that is US politics. Indeed, the way things are going, it’snot even a giventhat there will be free and fair elections in 2028. We must coalesce around whoever is best placed to chart a way out of Trumpism. And AOC, for all her flaws, has the sort of fight that is needed. I hope that she is not written off as too left or too right or too female before she has a chance to get started.Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsAlexandria Ocasio-CortezOpinionDemocratsZohran MamdaniUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

But they exploit fears that already come with pregnancyTue 23 Sep 2025 09.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 23 Sep 2025 09.46 EDTShareRobert F Kennedy Jrcontinued his futile search for a single pharmaceutical cause of autism on Monday, when theTrump administrationclaimed that distorted recent studies and misstated scientific evidence toallege a linkbetween women’s Tylenol use during pregnancy and the development of autism in children. Kennedy has long spoken with disturbing disgust about autistic people, claiming atone press conferencethat autistic children “destroy families” and “will never pay taxes. They’ll never hold a job. They’ll never play baseball. They’ll never write a poem. They’ll never go out on a date.” He had previously pledged to find thecause of autismby this month.As part of his apparent quest to eliminate this vast and varied group of people – who do, in fact, pay taxes, hold jobs, play baseball, write poems, go on dates, and function as beloved and caring members of functional families – Kennedy has already sought to restrict access to common vaccines. In June, hefired every memberof the advisory committee on immunization practices, an influential group of vaccine experts whose recommendations had long shaped policy for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In place of the experts, hereconstitutedthe panel with a number of vaccine critics and cranks, whose incompetence has led tochaotic meetingsand bizarrelychangingvaccinerecommendations.Donald Trumphas recently joined his health secretary in casting aspersions on childhood vaccines – safe and effective treatments that have saved countless lives and are among the more wonderful miracles of human innovation. “It’s too much liquid,” the presidentsaidof the early childhood immunizations on Monday. “Too many different things are going into that baby at too big a number. The size of this thing, when you look at it.”As a paediatrician, I want Australians to remember that paracetamol is a safe medication to use during pregnancy | Mike FreelanderRead moreTrump’s remarks came at what was supposed to be the debut for Kennedy’s new tactic:discouragingpregnant women from taking a common over-the-counter medication to ease pain or reduce fevers. At a rambling and shambolic press conference issued from the White House, Trump was unambivalent in hisunproven assertionsof the drug’s dangers. “Taking Tylenol is, uh, not good,”Trump said, flanked by Kennedy and Dr Mehmet Oz. “I’ll say it. It’s not good.” The president also offered his opinion that the weight-loss drug Ozempic doesn’t work, offering that his friends who take the drug are still fat. Kennedy, his face an uncanny color, stood awkwardly behind Trump, wearing a suit jacket that was visibly too small and with his head hanging slightly to the side; he looked a bit like a bored child at a prep school assembly. “Don’t. Take. Tylenol,” Trump continued, addressing pregnant women. “And don’t give it to the baby after the baby is born.”There isno evidence suggestingthat Tylenol causes autism. A small number of studies have shown a correlation – not a cause – between acetaminophen use and incidents of neurological development disorders in early childhood. But these studies, aside from being inconclusive in their results, are also flawed in their methodologies: because pregnant women cannot be easily or ethically sorted into control groups, it is impossible for researchers to isolate Tylenol as a causal factor in the ensuing health of their children. There is as much evidence to suggest that those women whose children later developed autism got it from the Tylenol they took as there is to suggest that they got it because of a gust of wind, or because their mothers wore the color green. Fevers, however – which Tylenol is used to treat – pose proven risks to a fetus, and have been linked to cleft lip and palate, spina bifida, and congenital heart defects. “The conditions that people use acetaminophen to treat during pregnancy are far more dangerous than any theoretical risks and can create severe morbidity and mortality for the pregnant person and the fetus,” Dr Steven Fleischman, the president of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, saidin a statement.Pregnant women do not lack for judgmental, frightening and dubiously factual instructions about their health. Everywhere, they are told that they risk the health of their fetus by partaking in a series of banal everyday activities – be it jogging or having coffee or eating a certain cheese – that they are told will lead, by obscure mechanisms that are never quite explained, to impossible and devastating health outcomes for their children-to-be. The admonishments are multiple and often contradictory, but they all tend to agree on one thing: that it is always good for women to deprive themselves of joy and relief – and to suffer more – for the sake of their fetuses.Health misinformation has thrived on the ignorance in which most women are kept about their bodies, particularly during pregnancy, and it feeds on the cruel combinationofneglectand lack of interest with which many women have been treated by the medical system and the maximally judgmental and punitive treatment that they receive from others while pregnant. Frightened women, scared both for the health of their pregnancies and for the ways they will be blamed if something goes awry, seek out a way to secure a good outcome, and are met by charlatans, grifters and quacks who are happy to tell them lies in exchange for their attention and money. It is this very dynamic, fed like a sourdough starter in the damp and fecund social media environment of the pandemic, that Kennedy used to revive his own career after decades of scandal and disgrace.Now, this cynical exploitation of pregnant women’s fears, deployed to them at a time when they are most vulnerable, is coming from no less a place of authority than the White House itself.America’s leadership class is failing us. It’s up to you and me to defend democracy | Robert ReichRead moreAt thepress conference, Trump advised pregnant women to simply endure their suffering. “A mother will have to tough it out,” he told them. Readers will forgive me if I posit that perhaps pregnant women in the US are already suffering enough. Six justices of the supreme court, three of them appointed by Trump himself,ruledin 2022 that they no longer have the federally protected right to terminate their pregnancies. The laws that have gone into effect since havecostseveral pregnant womentheir lives, as laws prohibit the medical interventions that could easily save them and allow them to die painful, premature andneedless deaths. Other women have had theircorpses desecratedfor the sake of Trump’s anti-choice agenda, as hospitals and lawmakers use themas incubatorsagainst their will. Others are being forced to wait for carewhile they bleedanddevelop sepsis, risking their organs and their lives. The Trump administration hascut off Medicaid fundingto some of the largest providers of sexual and reproductive healthcare, meaning many of the clinics that pregnant women rely on will now have to close. With doctors who provide gynecological and obstetric carefleeingstateswith strict abortion bans, many pregnant women in the US do not have access to competent medical care at all. As a result, more babies are being born sick, and more of them are dying. Women from states such as Floridareportbeing forced to carry fetuses that have no chance of surviving, and then being forced to watch those infants suffer and die in the moments after birth. As Kennedy continues with his search for the causes of autism, hiseugenicproject will inevitably extract more and more coercion and violence on the bodies of pregnant women. Today’s fearmongering about Tylenol is only the beginning.It can seem darkly comedic at times how laughably incompetent Trump and his administration are. Kennedy’s ill-fitting suit; the president’s ramblings about his fat friends; the brazen indifference to truth in the absurd claim that Tylenol, perhaps the paradigmatic over-the-counter drug, is somehow this lurking danger. Trump’s idiocy and vulgarity give the lie to the pomp and dignity of his office; his now near-total capture of American political life mocks the promise of democracy. But pregnant women are not a punchline. Their hopes for their families, their fears for their bodies, their health, their comfort and their dignity – all of these are things Trump is willing to sacrifice at the altar of his own ego. Tylenol isn’t dangerous, but he is.Moira Donegan is a Guardian US columnistExplore more on these topicsTrump administrationOpinionUS healthcareDonald TrumpRobert F Kennedy JrPregnancyAutismAbortioncommentShareReuse this content"

Why is he being rebranded as a national hero?Saida GrundyCelebrating a bigoted rage-baiter sends a clear message to people of color, LGBTQ+ folks and womenTue 23 Sep 2025 07.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 23 Sep 2025 14.44 EDTShareThe streets of Washington DC are unmistakable. In addition to noting the city’s signature architecture and public monuments, one will know they are in the nation’s capital when they can barely go half a city block without spotting a US flag. Two weeks ago, those flags were flying at half-staff, but not in recognition of the passing of a high-ranking public official, as would be customary. Instead, the half-staff wasordered by the White Housein a highly politicized effort to memorialize the 10 Septemberkillingof Charlie Kirk, a 31-year-old podcaster, hard-right party operative, and Maga youth influencer, as an event of national tragedy.Kirk ruled over an online fiefdom peddling his signature brand ofrage-baiting racist, xenophobic, Islamophobic and misogynistic commentary. It wasn’t just his vitriolic style, but also his popularization of cruelty, humiliation and dehumanization of political opponents – especially college students – that attracted millions to his audience. He famously said empathy was“a made-up, new age term that does a lot of damage”.As a Black woman, I felt no sorrow watching these flags hang limp and lifeless from chrome posts in the stiff, humid summer heat that, even on the eve of autumn, will not unhand a city already stifled byfederal threatsof military occupation. I felt the same when, just hours after the shooting, the speaker of the House of Representatives called for a moment of silence on the floor for a private citizen who had never held office nor served in the military. (The brief silence erupted seconds later into a shouting match melee when congresswoman Lauren Boebert requested that members hold an open prayer for Kirk from the floor). Just nine days later, the House passed a Republicanresolution eulogizing Kirk’s lifewith a sweeping 310-58 majority.Charlie Kirk’s killing was a tragedy. But we must not rewrite his life | Moira DoneganRead moreI felt no mourning when seven teams in the National Football League – the very organization that haslong been criticizedfor its inconsistent and often hypocritical stance on the place of politics in sports – held in-game memorials for Kirk, who never played any professional sport nor held a role within the league. In the Dallas Cowboys stadium in Texas, Jumbotrons featured a statesman-like image of Kirk, what one might expect for the passing of a former president or a longtime team affiliate. The grand gesture was drenched in hard-to-miss hypocrisy: forced silence from Black players who were punished for advocating for social justice in 2020, while, in the endzone, a painted astroturf read “End Racism” – a relic of just how fleeting the league’s lip service to the Black Lives Matter movement just a few years ago proved to be.I feel no grief because these memorials to Kirk are not created for me to grieve. Instead, they seek not only to enshrine Kirk into the national consciousness, but also to foster national memoriesabout what he represents ideologically and culturally. The lionizing is an official effort to coalesce the state into his movement – a brazen proclamation that his consistently hostilewhite nationalist, homophobic and misogynisticconvictions represent the federal government’s interests, and thus, what the presidency believesshouldbe the national priority.It’s reminiscent of the long aftermath of the civil war, when Confederate memorials were fashioned well into the 20th century not by those seeking to grieve any one individual, but rather by those who wanted to send a message about racial politics in the present. Some people have settled comfortably into a belief that the recent years of anti-racism protests and organizing have successfullytoppled enough of these Confederate monuments, that their white-washed histories collapsed with them. But memorials to Kirk conducted by the country’s most powerful institutions are evidence of the revival of a new iteration of neo-Confederate memorialization.Like the Confederate tributes and monuments of the past, current memorials to Kirk function to throttle any interrogation of their subject. Those who are elevated to the esteem of official national memorializing are commonly – although withnotable exceptions–figures that the public agrees are beyond reproach. In honoring Rosa Parks with the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1996, for example, Bill Clinton sought to canonize the entire Civil Rights Movement for which she fought. It cemented the era as worthy of national honor because it telegraphed the meaning of democracy and freedom for all Americans.In contrast, with the insta-extolling of Kirk, Donald Trump, who has announced that his lateclose personal friendwill be awarded aposthumous Medal of Freedom, echoes the intentions behind Confederate memorials of yore. Instead of public recognitions that reflect the long march towards a national reckoning with our past, memorials like those for Kirk elevate his consistent record of hard-right extremism above the reach of public questioning.Kirk’s style of seizing upon those who challenged his ideologies and punishing his detractors is an agenda that has expanded well beyond Trump’s track record of punishing his personal and political enemies. Though I, like the majority of Kirk’s critics, do not condone his shooting, Kirk himself said gun deaths were“worth it”to maintain gun rights. While rhetoric this extreme, including his claim that Black women in government and media lacked “brain processing power”, is being euphemized in tributes as his “advocacy for free speech”,media figures and government employeeswho openly question if he should be publicly lauded are beingfired from their jobs.Additionally, hundreds of college professors were doxed, harassed and threatened by Kirk’s organization, Turning Point USA, and its notorious“Professor Watchlist”, which published the names and information of any academics with views Kirk construed as incompatible with his own. It’s curious how a virtue like “doing politics the right way” can be afforded to someone who sought to devastate the lives of scholars and intellectuals.The aggrandizing of Kirk shares yet another, more lasting legacy with Confederate memorialization. The historianDavid Blightnotes that in the aftermath of the civil war, the call for reconciliation between white northerners and southerners was achieved at the expense of erasing the legacy of slavery from the postbellum narrative. Thus, the reunification of the white citizenry was done wholly on southern terms and exacerbated the racial atrocities that were never addressed in the postwar era, leaving Black Americans to be wholesale lynched and terrorized throughout the south.The US right claimed free speech was sacred – until the Charlie Kirk killingRead moreFurther still, reunification campaigns exonerated and elevated rebel insurgents who were, by definition, traitors and enemies of the state, to a status otherwise reserved for senior statesmen and decorated US veterans. It was a damning declaration that even those whosought to overthrow this countrywould be celebrated as its heroes before Black Americans would be treated as its citizens. The same tone is struck in the tributes to Kirk that exalt a highly controversial private citizen as though he were a national hero.Elected officials, journalists and public figures on the left who stresscalls for unitydo so on the right’s terms, and are reminiscent of the kid-gloved white northerners who sought to rebrand a war fought expressly over human trafficking and bondage into a national moment for celebration of duty, honor and valorous military service on both sides. Those who call forus to honor the life of a manwho saidthe 1964 Civil Rights Actwas a “huge mistake”, and who described Martin Luther King Jr, as “awful”, have betrayed those of us who heard Kirk espouse eugenics andreplacement theoryloud and clear, with such vast online influence that it prompted a 2024investigation by the Southern Poverty Law Center.The valorization of Kirk by his far-right defenders is an insult to millions of the most marginalized Americans who lived every day in the crosshairs of his rhetoric. Kirk’s memorialization by his supporters and apologists is but a new opportunity to announce an old message about whose country this is and whose it isn’t.Saida Grundy is an associate professor of sociology and African American studies at Boston University, and the author of Respectable: Politics and Paradox in Making the Morehouse ManExplore more on these topicsCharlie Kirk shootingOpinionRaceFar right (US)LGBTQ+ rightsIslamophobiaWomenUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

As itlimply explained: “Last Wednesday, we made the decision to suspend production on the show to avoid further inflaming a tense situation at an emotional moment for our country. It is a decision we made because we felt some of the comments were ill-timed and thus insensitive.”But now, apparently, all is well.“We have spent the last days having thoughtful conversations with Jimmy, and after those conversations, we reached the decision to return the show on Tuesday.”How lovely. How reasonable. How, well, kumbaya. All it took were some “thoughtful conversations with Jimmy” and everything returned to normal.Don’t believe it. In the days since ABC’s decision, the blowback against Disney has been hurricane level.Even if we can’t count on our elected politicians to protect our first amendment rights, we can rely on ourselvesAt least five entertainment industry unions, with at least 400,000 workers,spoke out, with the screenwriters’ union charging Disney with “corporate cowardice”.Celebrities Tom Hanks and Meryl Streepcalled out“government threats to our freedom of speech”.Kimmel was supported by his late-night peers including Stephen Colbert, Jimmy Fallon, Seth Meyers and John Oliver, all of whom blasted Disney and ABC with rapier-like humor.Jon Stewart devoted his show to a takedown of Disney’s cowardice.Disney talent was up in arms. Damon Lindelof, a creator of ABC’s Lost, threatened that if Kimmel’s show did not resume,he could not“in good conscience work for the company that imposed it”.Michael Eisner, a former Disney CEO, added a rare public rebuke.Even the rightwing Republican senator Ted Cruzexpressed concern, suggesting that Carr was speaking like a mafioso and calling his threats to retaliate against media companies “dangerous as hell”.“We should not be in this business,” Cruz said. “We should denounce it.”By Monday, Carr himself wasbusy minimizinghis role in the whole affair –denying he had threatenedto revoke the licenses of ABC stations (it “did not happen in any way, shape or form”) – and putting the onus on Disney for having made a “business decision” in response to negative feedback from viewers.America’s leadership class is failing us. It’s up to you and me to defend democracy | Robert ReichRead more“Jimmy Kimmel is in the situation that he’s in because of his ratings, not because of anything that’s happened at the federal government level,” Carr claimed.But the most intense pressure came fromus– from Disney viewers and customers – who immediately began to cancel subscriptions to Disney+ and Hulu and threaten a broader consumer boycott.Some celebrities, such as Tatiana Maslany, star of Marvel’s Disney+ series She-Hulk: Attorney at Law, and Rosie O’Donnell urged people to cancel their subscriptions.But the consumer boycott seems to have begun almost immediately.Shortly after Kimmel’s suspension was announced, Disney stock dipped about 3.5%. It continued to trade lower in subsequent days. The loss in market value has amounted to about $4bn.Investors got the message. Consumers were upset, which meant they’d buy fewer Disney products and services – which meant lower profits.There’s never one single reason for the ups and downs in the value of a particular firm’s shares of stock, but the timing here has been almost exact.Bottom line: we consumers have extraordinary power. We’re the vast majority. Like every other big corporation – especially one selling directly to consumers – Disney relies on us.Even if we can’t count on our elected politicians to protect our first amendment rights, we can rely on ourselves. When our outrage translates into withholding our consumer dollars, a big corporation like Disney is forced to listen – and respond.Next time you’re feeling powerless, remember this.Robert Reich, a former US secretary of labor, is a professor of public policy emeritus at the University of California, Berkeley.

Minor tweaks to beloved theme songs, shuffles to commentary booths and analysis teams, new scoreboard graphics, even changes to the duration and placement of ad breaks: all of these can trigger days, sometimes even years, of volcanic debate. For a certain type of sporting masochist it’s possible to plug into corners of the online sportingverse that are still litigating, say, the chyrons from the 2010 NBA finals, or ESPN’s decision – originally made in 2011, reversed in 2017, then reinstated in 2020 – to cut ties with Hank Williams Jr and his legendary All My Rowdy Friends Are Here on Monday Nightintro songfor Monday Night Football.The outrage prompted by the latest upheavals at ESPN certainly fits the pattern of involuntary fan resistance to change, but on closer inspection this is more than a case of a few disgruntled cable TV subscribers reenacting the “old man yells at cloud” meme. In August ESPNannouncedit was bringing on Katie Feeney, a recent Penn State graduate with 14 million followers across YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, and Snapchat, to produce sports and lifestyle content – offering “a blend of on-site access, fashion, and culture”, as the press release put it – for the network’s main broadcasts and digital channels.Feeney’s hiring is the latest move in ESPN’s drive to appeal to younger viewers, all those sewn-to-their-phones and (presumably) lifestyle content-hungry Gen Z and Gen Alpha hordes unenthused by the stuffier news-and-dad-banter offering ofESPNmainstays like SportsCenter and Pardon the Interruption. In 2020 the network brought on sporting influencer Omar Raja, founder of the House of Highlights, as a digital commentator, and its in-house “creator program”, a kind of year-long fellowship for promising young influencers that acts as a beachhead for ESPN into the burgeoning creator economy, is now in its third iteration.On its surface, the new ESPN looks innocent enough, and the network is hardly alone in trying to get down with the kids and freshen its output with a spritz of youthful rizz: the NBA and other leagues have introduced creator programs, MLB has invested in the podcast network Jomboy Media, and Fox Sports is collaborating with Barstool Sports. (The founders of Jomboy and Barstool are hardly young – Dave Portnoy, for example, is in his late 40s – but the material these networks produce is designed to go big on social media and rope in younger fans.) On the one hand, this is just the way sports broadcasting operates now: what fans see on their screens emerges from a series of “partnerships” with off-the-shelf online brands and personalities, rather than reflecting something more innate and homegrown about the journalistic metabolism and personality of the network itself.How the rightwing sports bro conquered AmericaRead moreThe output from influencers like Feeney and Raja, only a small fraction of which makes it to air on ESPN’s cable programming, is a mix of fan interviews, “crazy” scenes live from the tailgate, sideline clips that reveal nothing surprising from the sideline (the general tenor of which is, “The game is about to start!” or “Wow, can’t believe I’m here!”), get ready with me reels, behind the scenes footage of famous ESPN broadcasters standing around looking at their phones, and minute-long “hot takes” that are so thumpingly uninteresting they seem designed to instantly kill any debate. (“My hot take is that if your favorite teams aren’t all from the same city, you’re not a real fan” was arecent offeringfrom Raja, to which the only reasonable response is: OK?)This stuff is all trivial and expendable by design, but it’s hardly offensive: anyone who consumes sports on the internet is inured to this type of garbage, and the social media platforms are awash with sugary, under-one-minute video hits of players building their ideal teams or pronouncing their own names or trying to execute the perfect dap or naming their favorite pasta. It’s not as if creators like Feeney and Raja, however much noise ESPN has made about hiring them, enjoy the kind of prominence on air during live broadcasts that a fellow influencer like Dave Portnoy, say, commands over on Fox. For the most part, these figures feel like summer interns in a world still dominated by the big beasts of gameday.On the other hand, influencer creep symbolizes a broader rot at the heart of ESPN. It’s important to set these moves in their proper context. In just the past 12 months the network has inked a new$100m, five-year deal with Stephen A Smiththat allows him to be even louder than usual; it’s snapped up Inside the NBA, perhaps the most universally admired talk show in American sports broadcast history, from TNT; and most tellingly of all, it’s reached a deal with the NFL, an organization it is nominally supposed to cover critically, that will see the league take a 10% equity stake in ESPN in exchange for the rights to the NFL network and the league’s popular RedZone channel.Taken together, these deals herald a major shift: away from the adversarial tradition of reporting that the Entertainment and Sports Programming Network once stood for, toward a much more accommodating and insider-driven approach to covering sports. ESPN’s embrace of the creator economy is part of this broader push for a cozier relationship with power. For years, ESPN has managed a conflict between its dual function as both a broadcaster and a news service, screening professional sports even as its in-house reporters subjected those same sports to aggressive journalistic scrutiny. That tension was always difficult to negotiate, but the disruptions of the smartphone economy, which has blitzed attention spans, pushed the epicenter of sports talk away from cable TV to social media, and handed more power to individual leagues, teams and athletes to shape and influence media narratives to their liking, have made live sport the absolute business priority for networks like ESPN.View image in fullscreenThe NFL is a huge part of ESPN’s business model.Photograph: Adam Hunger/APSeveral highly regarded journalists have left ESPN in recent years, as the paramount importance of live programming to the network has become clear and reporting has come to be seen as a privilege, or a burden, or sometimes both. Among those who have left are excellent reporters and writers such as Zach Lowe and Pablo Torre, who recently reached a licensing deal to produce Pablo Torre Finds Out, his excellent, eponymous investigative podcast, for the New York Times. This continues a decade-long exodus of similar talents from ESPN, including Colin Cowherd and Dan Le Batard, extending all the way back to Bill Simmons’s acrimonious departure from the network in 2015.Does ESPN care that they no longer have these personalities, all of whom have gone on to have successful careers after leaving the network, to enrich their programming and “content” around game days? Did the studio executives look on in envy as Torre unspooled his string of summer love scoops, from theBill Belichick-Jordon Hudson romanceto thehectic coupling of Kawhi Leonard and a tree-planting company? It seems unlikely. When they have Katie Feeney locking in the youth demographic withsponconfor Neutrogena Hydro Boost (“my go-to for hydrated, juicy skin”) and bringing viewers exclusive, behind-the-scenesfootageof what @SAWEETIE, “the first ever female curator for Monday Night Football”, would do as her touchdown celebration dance, what need does ESPN really have for the fussy old business of journalism? The stories all come from inside the locker room now, or directly from the players themselves: questions, criticism, scrutiny are anathema to ESPN’s fresh mission as a souped-up PR agency. There is stillworthy reportingthat comes out of the company’s creaking news arm but it’s clear that ESPN’s priorities now lie elsewhere.Increasingly, it seems like the old media model, in which the networks that broadcast live sport could do double duty as aggressive excavators of those same sports’ ugly truths, has passed. From now on, sports coverage is divided between two camps. On one side are the insiders, the broadcasters, the image-fluffers, fabulously well resourced and operated for mutual benefit in partnership with the sports world’s most powerful entities; on the other are the outsiders, the journalists, the critics, perpetually strapped for cash and digging for revelatory nuggets around a sporting-corporate PR machine that’s built to withstand the apocalypse. Where it once tried to keep a foot in both camps, ESPN now stands irrevocably on the side of the powerful: a company that once set the news agenda in sports is now just another sweaty social media setup fishing for quick clicks.With occasional noble exceptions,whatever sports “content” it produces from this day forward will be necessarily soft-focus and unchallenging.The vapidity of the new ESPN captures the crisis of modern sports media. In the attention economy, what exactly is the role of broadcast media during the lulls when sports are not being played live? For a shrinking corner of the professional commentariat, sport in its “dead” time is still something to subject to sustained critique and discussion, a topic appropriate for serious journalism and analysis. But for ESPN, sport has become fluff, visual candy cotton, an inexhaustible source of sugar in a contest for viewer-consumers’ addiction as endless as the feeds on our phones. Rather than pushing back against the easy tyranny of the vacant scroll, ESPN is giving in to it, trying to ride it – and the vision of a zonked-out, lobotomized viewership is captured perfectly in the network’s Black Mirroresquenew slogan, “Sports Forever”.By chasing dollars, ESPN is betraying the very fans on whose passion it has built its success, trading away its journalistic credibility for a diminished status as the glorified Pravda of the modern American sportscape. The network’s approach to covering sport now is properly post-journalistic, built on player access, highlights, fan experiences, viral squirts of memebrain swill skimmed from the trough of online trend culture, and zero contestation. It’s a strategy that elevates narrative management over entertainment, teams over viewers, money over truth. And increasingly, it feels like the future – a reality that should trouble anyone who cares about sports and the real stories that shape them.Explore more on these topicsUS sportsESPNUS television industryTelevision industrycommentShareReuse this content"

Causation is a very important consideration and, as a paediatrician, I know that parents often ask why their child has autism.Particularly in the severe end of the autism spectrum, genetic disorders can present with autistic features; for example Angelman syndrome, Smith-Magenis syndrome, Williams syndrome and many others. However, for the majority of the children who are diagnosed with autism, no cause is found. We also know that the number of children diagnosed with autism in the developed world is increasing. There are many reasons for this, not least that we are better at diagnosing it. However, in my work I often heard the question “why is my child autistic?”There have been many studies over many decades trying to answer this question. There has also been a number of discredited claims – such as those around MMR vaccines propagated by false prophets (of which the US health and human services secretaryRobert F Kennedy Jr is one)which have led to poor health outcomes and caused considerable distress and damage. These claims have been repeatedly disproven but are continuing to be promulgated by some.Australian health experts warn Trump’s unfounded autism claims about paracetamol may harm pregnant womenRead moreThe recent comments by the US president Donald Trumpregarding a possible linkbetween paracetamol (acetaminophen, Panadol, Tylenol) usage during pregnancy and causation of autism is very worrying on many levels.Firstly, there is no evidence of causation in any study that I have seen, and while there may be small associations, a causative effect has been disproved by the largest and most recentSwedish studyand Japanese study. Secondly, there has already been significant distress caused and nothing has been done to explain what evidence has been used and what is the scientific evidence for his comments.Paracetamol is a very important and commonly used medication in pregnancy and is classified as safe. Alternative medications are not as safe and can affect the foetus.Medicine regulators around the world, including in the UK and our own TGA (Therapeutic Goods Administration), have concluded that paracetamol is safe for use during pregnancy based on “rigorous assessment of the best available scientific evidence”.We should trust our regulatory framework to provide us with the best scientific evidence to make decisions about healthcare and not unscientific and poorly informed health policy.Our regulatory agency, the TGA, is the best in the world and I am confident in their advice.Any comments about the diagnosis, management and causative mechanisms of complex neurodevelopmental disorders have the potential to cause significant anxiety and distress. They may also lead to inappropriate health outcomes.It is very important that concerns are dealt with by timely assessment of the scientific evidence and that we listen to the experts. TheUS presidentandhealth secretaryhave failed to do that in the past and arecontinuing a patternof ad hocactionsthat will not end well.In Australia we are very lucky to have regulatory systems of the highest standards and we need to trust in them.Dr Mike Freelander is a paediatrician and the federal MP for the NSW seat of MacarthurExplore more on these topicsHealthOpinionAutismDonald TrumpcommentShareReuse this content"

That is no longer an option and Beijing has other prioritiesTue 23 Sep 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 23 Sep 2025 09.43 EDTShareEurope’s relationship with the USis unmoored, but it has also lost its bearings with regard to China, caught by competing forces that pull and push in opposite directions.Europe’s China policy used to be a function of Washington’s. When Barack Obama tried and then failed topivot to Asiain 2011, sucked into turmoil in the Middle East instead, Europeans lulled themselves into the belief that their relationship with Asia could continue to be driven by trade, with security an afterthought.Despite rising tensions in the South China Sea, the Korean peninsula and the Taiwan strait, European governments viewed Asia, including China, through a predominantly economic lens. China’s belt and road initiative was initially seen as a purely economic endeavour, lacking strategic edge. It was only as US-China relations soured, under the first Trump administration and then especially under Joe Biden, that Brussels switched gears.China was no longer seen only as a partner, but more warily, as a competitor and systemic rival.Investment screening, tariffs and export controls entered the European lexicon when talking about China. The link to the US was clear. While the EU rejected any decoupling from China, considering it undesirable and impossible, it began advocating “de-risking” instead. Once unpacked, this is no different from other trademark European concepts such asstrategic autonomyand economic security. But the timing and the framing of Brussels’s more hawkish line made it clear that its north star on China was Washington.This worked so long as the transatlantic relationship was strong and Washington’s approach toChinawas clear and predictable. None of that is true today. Toughening up to match China’s assertiveness, for instance, by accepting and even advocating for Nato’s role in east Asia, continues to anger Beijing.But it no longer necessarily rallies favour in Washington. The Trump administration may bully Europeans to inflict costs on China, for example by applying secondary sanctions on countries that continue to buy Russian oil and gas. But this does not guarantee that Trump will stand by Europe on Ukraine, or that Washington has any intention of exerting meaningful economic pressure on Beijing. So far, it’s China that has retained the upper hand in the trade war with the US. Trump treats Europe as subservient: he’s happy to see it inflict economic pain on Beijing at its own cost, but wants to avoid incurring such costs himself. As with most things Trump-related, it’s a toss of the coin whether he escalates or strikes deals with Beijing, naturally over the heads of European and Asian partners.With Washington’s north star gone, Europeans are left figuring out what they actually think, and how they’ll act towards China. Should they double down on trade protectionism to counter the negative impact on Europe of Chineseindustrial overcapacity? Should they encourage Chinese technology transfers to the continent, avoid a trade war and jointly develop a strategy with Asia to save the global trade order? Should they embrace Chinese green tech, aware that proceeding with the energy transition and meeting climate ambitions is impossible without it, or try to dilutegreen dependencyon China? And in the global south, as the US exits from the development aid field, can the EU realistically counterChina’s vast belt and roadinitiative, or should it reconcile itself to its own “global gateway” infrastructure initiative being complementary to it?View image in fullscreenThe AVATR Technology electric vehicle factory in Chongqing, China.Photograph: Alex Plavevski/EPANone of these questions have simple answers. Making them harder still are two underlying dilemmas that lie at the heart of Europe’s own future.First is the future of liberal democracy in Europe. Democracy is under threat in the west. Far-right, nationalist and populist forces are on the rise, as is polarisation, radicalisation, disinformation and extremism, threatening fundamental freedoms, the rule of law and the separation of powers. China, unlike Russia and the Maga movement in the US, does not explicitly back these far-right forces, nor does it appear to have any desire to export its model of government. However, given that China is the ultimate case of an economically successful authoritarian system, it inspires those in Europe who want to see their countries move in an illiberal direction. No wonder that China’s closest European partners are Hungary, Slovakia and Serbia, as was blatantly on display when their leaders (or, in Hungary’s case, foreign minister) attended China’s military parade in Beijing in September. When it comes to the magnetic draw that China exerts on authoritarian and illiberal forces in Europe, there’s not much European governments and institutions can expect from Beijing. The onus is on them to demonstrate that liberal democracy delivers.The second dilemma regards security, and in particular the war in Ukraine. While China claims to be neutral maintaining ties with Kyiv and Moscow – and, at least theoretically, supports sovereignty and territorial integrity – in practice it sides with Moscow. President Xi Jinping’s no-limits friendship with Vladimir Putin is increasingly on display, and Beijing’s peace efforts on Ukraine have proved empty. In fact, China has visibly benefited from the war, not only through cheap Russian oil and gas, but especially strategically: Russia has become the junior partner in the relationship.Europe cannot push China to turn its back on Russia, nor expect it to stop trading with Russia. But if China were truly neutral, it wouldn’t support Russia through the export of dual-use technology. If it genuinely wanted the war to end, it would exert pressure on Moscow, just like it did to mitigate Putin’s worst instincts when he irresponsibly threatened the use of nuclear weapons. Especially now that Trump’s failed diplomacy on Ukraine has revealed to all that it’s Putin, and Putin alone, that does not want the war to end.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I said that it was not only a question of values – on which, tragically, any remaining European credibility has collapsed since the Gaza war – but of security interests. The replies I got were telling. Just as Europeans now view their relationship with China through the lens of Russia, China sees Europe through the paradigm of its competition with the US. Beijing believes that if worst comes to worst in US-China relations, Europe would stand with Washington, notwithstanding Trump and the US’s abandonment and betrayal of Europe. For China, I was told, keeping Russia on side is a strategic must. In the current circumstances Russia trumps Europe from Beijing’s perspective. It’s hard not to see the logic.Russia represents a vital threat to European security and Europeans will bend over backwards to keep the US engaged in their defence. This is likely to fail – regardless of how much flattery and self-abasement they offer to Trump. And while Europe could potentially confront Russia without the US, it cannot do so while China is in its crosshairs too.This leaves Europe with no easy way out, but wishing the problem away is no answer.Nathalie Tocci is a Guardian Europe columnistExplore more on these topicsEuropeOpinionChinaUrsula von der LeyenEuropean UnionUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

Now will international law die in Gaza too?Raji SouraniThere is a UN convention for exactly this kind of horror: the convention for the prevention and punishment of the crime of genocide. When will the world act on it?Raji Sourani is the coordinator of the Palestinian legal team at the international criminal court (ICC)Tue 23 Sep 2025 10.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 23 Sep 2025 10.22 EDTShareIsrael has committed and continues to commit genocide in Gaza. That is the conclusion ofa UN commission report. Since the release of the report last week,Palestine has finally been recognisedas an independent state by the UK and a number of other countries. In his announcement at the weekend, Keir Starmer called the death and destruction in Gaza “utterly intolerable”. This recognition comes too late and is still conditional, but has the UK government indeed now stopped tolerating Israel’s devastation of Gaza? Has anything changed for the people there who are being starved and bombed? Far from it.Even as the UN publishes the findings of its independent commission, anda flag is raisedoutside the Palestinian mission in London, mass displacement and killing continues to take place in Gaza City asIsrael attacks. As a lawyer who has spent my life believing in the rule of law, this makes me wonder: will Gaza’s destruction also bring with it the death of international law?From the very beginning, all one had to do was look at the words of Israel’sleadersto see that the intent to commit genocide was there. Israeli ministers andpoliticians promisedthat Gaza would be flattened, placed under siege and starved. The bombardments have been merciless and wide, targeting schools, homes and hospitals. And the majority of Israel’s victims arechildren and women. Maiming, starvation, lack of medical care and death have been people’s daily experiences in Gaza. Nobody has acted to stop it.Palestinian suffering has been livestreamed for the world to watch. Israel has shown exactly what it is doing to trapped Palestinians. Despite thekilling of many brave journalists, others have continued to show the reality: the genocide has been broadcast straight to your screen at home. Still, governments around the world haven’t stopped it.Palestinian groups documenting the atrocities – including the Palestinian Centre for Human Rights (PCHR), of which I am director, well as the Al Mezan Center for Human Rights andPalestinian rights organisation Al-Haq– have beentargetedbyIsraeli airstrikesandsanctionedby the US Treasury for documenting legal evidence of the crimes being committed. Even theUN special rapporteurFrancesca Albanese and international criminal court (ICC) officials – including chief prosecutorKarim Khan– are being threatened and sanctioned for speaking out about their findings. These findings match those in thePCHR’s newest report: that the intent to commit genocide was there from October 2023 onwards, evidenced by the testimony of the very survivors and victims that we should have been protecting.The UN’s commission now joins the wide consensus that Palestinians in Gaza have been experiencing genocide. This is a welcome intervention. But it is also crucial to remember that the purpose of thegenocide conventionis in its full name:the conventionon the prevention and punishment of the crime of genocide. The philosophy for it was to be preventiveandpunitive – which means we are at a crossroads now. This genocide was not prevented, but it can still be stopped. Will this be enough for people to act? Or will the pounding of Gaza also turn the principles of international law into rubble?I speak not just as a Palestinian, but as a lawyer who spent the last 48 years practising, and believing in the sanctity of, law. I devoted my life and expertise to this, because in my heart I felt there must be something to protect, and that the law would serve the most vulnerable people. But what we have been shown in governments’ inaction and complicity is an ugly reality. We may be looking at a new world where international law is selective and politicised.A genocide in our time with this level of mass killing, destruction, pain and suffering shows how fragile the rule of law is. Arrest warrants issued by the ICC has not prevented a genocide. Yet another institution finding thatIsraelis committing genocide has not stopped it. The law can only exist if it is enforced and applied to all. The facts are there, the law is there. No one can claim they didn’t know. As a society, we cannot allow international law to die in Gaza by allowing Israel’s impunity.As more institutions come to the same conclusions, I can only hope that more pressure is put on governments who are still aiding and providing arms to Israel. For these declarations and recognitions to offer any tangible hope to the people of Gaza, they must come with comprehensive action. The states who have been reluctant must follow Spainin taking a clear positionby instigating an arms embargo. The cover and partnership offeredby the UKand US to Israel for its genocide must stop.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

(Spoiler: it happened again.) “For starters, Mr Epstein has hired a full-time male masseur (the man happens to be a former Ultimate Fighting champion). He has also organised what he calls a board of directors of friends to counsel him on his behaviour.”Dearie me. Maybe that’s what his friend Prince Andrew was doing in the famous photo of them walking in Central Park two years later, bundled up against the New York cold and an approaching tornado of sex-abuse allegations? Although, hang on, because that was the four-day house visit that Andrew said he’d made to break off contact for ever with Epstein. “I took the decision that I had to show leadership,”he boastedto Emily Maitlis, “and I had to go and tell him: that’s it.” As most people wondered of the dim-witted old sleazebucket when that Newsnight interview came out: could you not have done it on the phone instead? But then, of course he couldn’t, because this was not actually the end of contact at all. An email from a few months later hasalready surfaced, sent from Epstein to what the UK Financial Conduct Authority redact as a “member of the British royal family”, looking to set up a meeting between said royal and thesince-disgraced former Barclays bossJes Staley. The response from the “member of the British royal family” was: “Keep in close touch and we’ll play some more soon!!!” Look, maybe it was Princess Anne.The trouble with being thick and telling this many lies is that you can never remember which one you’ve told. This is certainly the situation Andrew’s former wife, Duchess Fergie, finds herself in this week, as some of her own emails to Epstein have surfaced, and have promptly detonatedher 2011 statementto the Evening Standard that, “I abhor paedophilia and any sexual abuse of children and know that this was a gigantic error of judgment on my behalf. I am just so contrite I cannot say.” Fergie promised to “have nothing ever to do with Jeffrey Epstein ever again”. We now discover it was just weeks before she was writing privately to Epstein saying she never said all the things she definitely said.Charities are dropping her left, right and centre, but what else can they do? “I know you feel hellaciously let down by me from what you were either told or read and I must humbly apologise to you and your heart for that,”Fergie fawnsin one email to Epstein. “You have always been a steadfast, generous and supreme friend to me and my family. As you know, I did not, absolutely not, say the ‘P word’ about you …” Absurd to find her too prim to even type the word “paedophile”, though not to be supreme friends with someone who had literally been to prison for soliciting minors.Epstein had given her money, of course. She says fifteen grand. Then again, she says a lot of things. The duchess’s debts werereported to be £5mat the time, because she has always spent money – other people’s money – like water. Has she claimed this longterm trait was a mental illness yet? I wouldn’t rule that out in the coming months. For now, her team are saying of these excruciating Epstein emails: “Like many people, she was taken in by his lies” – a virtual cut-and-paste of Peter Mandelson’s claim a couple of weeks ago that he regrets “being taken in by [Epstein] as many other people do”.The more I think about this fashionable line of defence, the more bizarre I find it. If I had a wildly rich and incredibly connected friend, and they still ended up going to prison for 18 months – even with the most shit-hot rottweiler lawyers (Alan Dershowitz and Kenneth Starr!); even under the US’s grotesque plea bargaining system – then I would simply assume this friend had done the thing they were convicted of, and most probably much worse. It’s called being realistic. Do we truly believe that stretched local Florida police forces have the time or inclination to confect whole cases, spend years of asymmetric legal wrangling trying to push them over the line, get done over by a plea deal that bumps the case back down to state level and seals it, and do it all as part of some envious conspiracy? No. No way on earth. Any conspiracy ran the other way. “This was not a ‘he said, she said’ situation,” thepolice chief who led the probe saidruefully after the stitch-up. “This was 50-something ‘shes’ and one ‘he’ – and the ‘shes’ all basically told the same story.’’skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

That culture was everywhere before feminism | Rebecca SolnitRead moreI’m not saying everyone in the world should have known this about Epstein back in 2008 – so many sex cases, so little time – and there was no reason most people would even have heard of him at this stage. But any close friend of his would have been following the reports. Any of them who didn’t assume the grim reality just chose not to, out of moral cowardice, personal greed, staggeringly wilful blindness or sociopathic indifference. The end.Epstein obviously cast things differently. In his nutty NYT interview, he “likened himself to Gulliver shipwrecked among the diminutive denizens of Lilliput. ‘Gulliver’s playfulness had unintended consequences,’ Mr Epstein said. ‘That is what happens with wealth. There are unexpected burdens as well as benefits.’”Do me a favour. And yet Fergie herself has played a version of this tiny violin for decades, and will again now she has been found out, again. Her victim narrative has been surprisingly durable, even though she has helped burn through more fortunes than almost every other person on this planet will ever see:£20m chaletsin Verbier; the£15m mucky mansion; houses she never even moved into; eternal luxury holidays; endless retinues of unnecessary staff … she has pulled in more than some of her charities ever will. How many of her financial empires have fallen, only for a new one to rise again when someKazakh oligarch/sex Gulliver/other mysterious billionaire conveniently turns up in the nick of time to buy her out or bail her out? The king is still doing it, probably dreading the deeper liability of her being outside the tent. It’s unclear quite how long that will be able to hold if further emails between Prince Andrew and Epstein emerge, as seems a distinct possibility.Whatever happens, however, this is not victimhood. I’m sure one of Epstein’s actual victims could explain the difference.Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

No disrespect to thetwo surviving aspirants, Bridget Phillipson and Lucy Powell, but Labour – for the nation’s welfare, for its own party interests and for those of the prospective future office holder – should take the chance to abolish the post and snuff out the campaign with it.As one who toiled some moons ago for an especially prominent holder,Denis Healey, I can confirm that it is a truly awful job: fully meriting the estimation ofJohn Nance Garnerwho, having served as vice-president of the US between 1933 and 1941, declared the subsidiary role to be “not worth a bucket of warm piss”.The deputy leader role entails responsibility without power. The holder has to plough through screeds of internal party business that is of interest only to political maniacs, barrack-room lawyers and those trying to exploit the party’s procedures for their own ends, or some special cause that would embarrass the leader. The holder is expected to rebut these, especially on behalf of a leader who is actually running the country, while assuring their promoters that they really have their interests at heart.The leader will fob off countless delegations and foreign visitors from fraternal organisations with a meeting with the deputy. The latter’s hands will be numbed with shaking those of such visitors, and they will have to learn the pre-emptive semi-hug of pretended rapturous welcome. The deputy’s Christmas or New Year greetings card list will rise to unmanageable heights, the supply of House of Commons ones expected by recipients will run out and the deputy’s dogsbody will have to wheedle them from colleagues. The deputy will eat countless party dinners or sandwiches, make countless speeches, present countless awards, pose for countless photographs, and then try to remember names and accomplishments.The party has done without a deputy leader in the past. It is always redundant in government and generally dangerous in opposition, especially if the leader is not making much headway. Far from helping to unify the party, the very existence of the post encourages rumours of turf wars and splits. If the deputy has the temerity to outshine the leader, they are accused of planning a coup. If they are a loyal “deputy dullard”, they are accused of slacking and skulking. It is also sure to be an even more thankless job under this administration, with Starmer reportedly aremote and distantfigure, unable to see his own chancellorcryingafter failing to defend her.In government, the deputy leader has to be found some kind of job (apart from going to funerals). This will usually be some kind of overlordship or coordination of something that no one else wants to overlord or coordinate. The reshuffle has filled all the desirable posts and if the sacked Powell were elected deputy, Starmer would have to create some new berth in government to keep her compliant. Several recent administrations have appointed a minister for loneliness. Perhaps the incumbent, Stephanie Peacock – if she’s even been informed that loneliness comes under her civil society brief – could make way for deputy Powell, were she to succeed.Fortuitously, only three deputy leaders in more than a century have made their mark on the party’s history as well as the country’s.In 1939, Clement Attlee was recovering from an operation and it was the bibulous and bumbling Arthur Greenwood, his deputy, who was induced tospeak for Englandin a packed House of Commons and force Neville Chamberlain into war over Poland.In 1994, after the death of John Smith, his deputy, Margaret Beckett, became acting leader – the first of two women, along with Harriet Harman, to have had the job on an interim basis, in contrast to the Conservatives, who have managed to find four female leaders, three of them prime ministers. Beckett was in office for about 70 days, outlasting the tenure of Liz Truss. This has clearly left its mark. Only last week,Beckett suggested“nobody in their right mind would want” the deputy post, adding: “A terrible job, really ghastly.”In 1981, the job became the setting of a civil war that determined the future of the Labour party and British politics with it, after Denis Healey’s surprise defeat in the previous year’s leadership ballot (of MPs only) by Michael Foot. Tony Benn was obliged to launchhis long-intended challenge to Healeyfor the deputy leadership and pretend that the post was tremendously important. This proved to be a self-fulfilling prophecy, especially when a third candidate, John Silkin, entered the contest.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

At the beginning of the campaign, a survey found Healey ahead by 25 percentage points in Labour’s new electoral college. In the final vote, announced to the Brighton conference, Healey prevailed over Benn by less than 1%. I calculated that for each week I had worked for him in the campaign, Healey had lost one percentage point of his lead. Had I been given just one more, Benn would have beaten him.The Britain of today has no need of such counterfeit drama, so give Labour members the chance to vote the deputy leadership into extinction. “Neither of the above” on the ballot paper should do it.Richard Heller is an author and former political adviserExplore more on these topicsLabour party deputy leadershipOpinionLabourBridget PhillipsonLucy PowellcommentShareReuse this content"

Open the suitcase: no toothpaste. No problem, my friend insisted, grabbing his phone with the little twinkle in his eye that people get when they’re about to show off a neat trick. They deliver everything here, he said. We’ll call the store downstairs. And so it was with a kind of slack-jawed astonishment I answered the doorbell nine minutes later to a man in a motorcycle helmet, proffering a single blue carrier bag containing a single tube of Colgate, taking the money and receding wordlessly back into the night.This, a decade ago, was my first contact withDubai. And though of course you can get gig-economy groceries in most major cities these days, Dubai still stands out as a world of shortcuts and simple conveniences, a world of abundance and plenty, a world where everyone and everything has its price. If you fancy a quadruple-decker club sandwich at 3am, Dubai has you covered. Taxis are cheap and everywhere. At the famous Friday brunches hosted by most of the luxury hotels, afternoons dissolve in a bouquet of bottomless fizz, the plates shovelled high with food that will never be eaten. For three weeks I drifted through its five-star establishments and pristine malls, pursued by aggressive blasts of air conditioning, trying not to look into the shadows.This is the Dubai that gets served up by the countless athletes and celebrities and entrepreneurs and lifestyle influencers and friends on your Instagram feed: a temple of rooftop bars and postcard sunsets, gratification and guilt-free consumption. In a way, this is a place whose unabashed ostentation could scarcely have been better suited around the age of shareable content: a city constructed entirely of snapshots, a secret that dares you to keep it to yourself, an escape from your dreary, high-tax, pigeon-plagued existence.Recently, however, a certain vibe shift has taken place. A harder and more cogent vision of Dubai seems to have emerged in our political discourse, one in which the emirate is depicted not simply as an escapist lifestyle or luxury holiday destination, but a model society that we should be trying to emulate ourselves. Glossy travel features have evolved into full-blown paeans to Emirati society and culture. And if you peer between the lines, you get perhaps the clearest glimpse yet of exactly how the populist right wants to remake the UK.“That’s the level of ambition the rest of the world needs,”the broadcaster Piers Morgan gushedon a trip to the city earlier this year. And it was interesting to see Reform UK announcing its latest immigration plans on Monday witha favourable nodto the United Arab Emirates system, in which migrants are issued periodic work visas that continually need to be renewed. “As a political class, we’re not prepared to learn enough from other nations that are getting it right,” said the party’s deputy leader, Richard Tice,in a BBC interviewearlier this year.View image in fullscreenWorkers at a construction site in Dubai in August 2023.Photograph: Rula Rouhana/ReutersSo what does Reform reckon Dubai is getting right? Tice spoke approvingly of the state’s low rate of crime, its sense of national pride, the way schoolchildren are made to stand in class every morning for the national anthem. Tice, in turn, was endorsinga Telegraph columnwritten by his partner, Isabel Oakeshott, who relocated to Dubai last year to escape Labour’s tax on private schools. In it, she enthused over her new home: “a place without striking train drivers, aggressive pro-Hamas marches and endless rain … no toxic gender ideology claptrap or critical race theory … no Just Stop Oil protesters … Those who break the law or can’t look after themselves are simply imprisoned or deported … With no safety net … everyone is hustling.” Here, then, is the quiet part being said out loud.Dubai presents the hard-right vision of utopia: a place stripped of workers’ protections or the right to protest, a place of pure environmental dereliction, a place where everyone drives everywhere, a place where the queer and the gender-fluid are told from birth that they simply do not exist, a place where citizenship is defined along narrow ethnic lines and everyone else is there on sufferance, where the super-rich and well-connected can simply do and consume as they please. A place where the poor are simply cleared out of sight.But of course, the poor do exist in Dubai. They live in often squalid camps on the baking peripheries of the city, working long hours for low wages with no protections, indentured if not always by law then by circumstance. Migrant workersform almost 90% of the UAE population, most from south Asia or the Philippines. And unlike the small and gilded class of native Emiratis who enjoy free healthcare and a generous welfare state, they must toil unquestioningly in a system engineered to embed their subservience.This is the golden archetype of which the influencer Andrew Tate speaks when he calls for “white Dubai”, a country explicitly modelled on racial hierarchy, where the existence of a permanent underclass is not a design flaw but the very point of the exercise. “Give white people a country where only they are citizens,” he urges to his millions of followers. “Everyone else is a visitor on a visa with a two-tier legal system, impenetrable borders and instant deportations.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It would have massive wealth inequalities baked in, perhaps even revered, an endless reservoir of black and brown men to serve your drinks and build your nine-lane highways. It would, in short, look a lot like Dubai.But there would be flags everywhere, and crime would be low, and the buildings would be tall and gleaming, and most importantly you could hire a migrant worker to bring a tube of toothpaste to your front door at any time of the day or night. Come for the beaches and the brunches; stay for the privatised healthcare and human rights restrictions. And of course these two visions of Dubai are not separate but in service of each other: a way of life being sold to us selfie by selfie, scroll by scroll, story by story, by people who often have no idea what they are really selling.Jonathan Liew is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

But their message was far too timidTue 23 Sep 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 23 Sep 2025 10.05 EDTShareNot here in this tolerant green and pleasant land of gentle, if deserted, country churches. No, surely Britain is well-fortified against American-style extreme evangelism. But Christianity erupts in its latest manifestation as far-right nationalist politics cosplaying as piety. Take seriously these Christian soldiers marching onward as to war under Tommy Robinson’s banner, some dressed as crusaders. “Are we still a Christian country?” a GB News reporter asked the prime minister, who wriggled uncomfortably beside Donald Trump at their press conference.Keir Starmer is an atheist and a humanist who celebrates Jewish festivals with his family, so here’s his reply verbatim: “Yeah, look, I mean, in terms of a Christian country, I was christened. So, that is … my church has been, um, all my life. And we are, that is, wired into our informal constitution. Of course, we celebrate many other faiths as well. I’m really proud that we’re able to do so as a country.” That was probably the best he could do without lying as he took on the excruciating duty, on our behalf, not to offend the bully who can wreck our economy at the click of his small fingers.Labour is not yet strapped into armour for the fight with the right, still tongue-tied, lacking the language, afraid of offending Tommy Robinson supporters instead of confronting them. Gloves-off, racist demagogues are on the march and the country is at more risk than it was when the threat came from Oswald Mosley’s blackshirts: he drew10,000 to a rally at Olympiain London in 1934, plus the Mail’s raucous support. Nigel Farage and Reform UK keep their distance from the march, but they draw on anti-immigration emotions Robinson arouses. Farage has the voice of most of the rightwing press now: in an election tomorrow, he could take No 10.Church leaders finallyproduced a public letterthis week against what they called “co-opting or corrupting of the Christian faith to exclude others”. But how timid: “Many individuals and communities felt anxious, unsettled and even threatened by aspects of the march.” Well, yes indeed, terrified. “There were undoubtedly diverse motivations for those engaged in the event.” For too many there was just one motivation: racism. They sympathised: “We also understand that for many of those involved in the rally there is a deep sense of frustration at feeling unheard and forgotten in the democratic process” and society must deal with “poverty, inequality and exclusion”. I believe that lots of those marching were doing so because of racism and thuggery, not poverty or democracy. The churches, which said they were “deeply concerned” about the misuse of “Christian symbols, particularly the cross”, sounded like a company protecting its logo.On the Robinson march in London, the great wooden crosses looked like armaments: 26 police officers were injured, four seriously. The marchers’ “Christ is King” flags declared a radicalised ethno-supremacism. Robinson claims he was “led to Christ” by a far-right pastor, Rikki Doolan,while in prison; Farage is warier of God, but rallies crowds for “standing up for our Judeo-Christian culture”.Humanists UK was a lone voicesounding the alarmabout far-right Christians looking to dissolve the boundaries between church and state, and promote deeply conservative values. The idea was long dismissed as an Americanism that couldn’t happen here, but here it is. The assassination of Charlie Kirk was a horrible reminder of democracy in danger, but his dictumsdefine the Christian nationalist threat: “If I see a Black pilot, I’m going to be, like, boy, I hope he’s qualified.” “Prowling Blacks go around for fun to go target white people, that’s a fact.” To Taylor Swift: “Reject feminism. Submit to your husband. You’re not in charge.” “Islam is the sword the left is using to slit the throat of America.”The Liberal Democrats fearlessly warned “the country is in peril” at their party conference. Ed Davey wisely refused the Trump banquet, calls for sanctions against Elon Musk for “inciting violence” and cleverly packed their hall with union flags, encouraging everyone to put out more flags, reclaiming them from the right. While Kemi Badenoch trails after Robert Jenrick into the arms of Faragism, Labour is not yet in full-throated, no-holds-barred refutation of Farage, with Blue Labour delusions of wooing back lost “red wall” voters: they’ve gone. Faith-flag-and-family Lord Glasman is mostly on GB News calling Brexit “magnificent” and demanding European Convention of Human Rights withdrawal,as monitored bythe New World.Labour is held back by misplaced social conscience, sympathising with left-behind places where Reform flourishes. But mumbling self-doubt is no way to face down a hateful mob. Xenophobia always lurks beneath the skin, waiting for some opportunist demagogue to inflame it into a festering boil. It requires decent politicians uniting to lance it, countering it with values broadly shared by most people.You might think this most secular country isvaccinated against Christian nationalism, when 53% have no religion and only 37% call themselves Christians. But the Christian label offers a veneer of respectability to tribal racists unlikely to fill actual pews, an identity cloak for gut nativists who abhor anyone a bit brown.Remember how Brexit began with a few harmless “fruitcakes”. And don’t underestimate the power of the vastly wealthy right. Foremost is the hedge-funder Paul Marshall, Brexiter, joint owner of GB News, founder of UnHerd, owner of the Spectator: he helped fund his close friend Michael Gove’s plan to send a King James Bible to every school when Gove was education secretary. (Gove is now editor of the Spectator.) He attends service at the Holy Trinity Brompton (HTB), which founded the Alpha course, hotbed of the Christian conservatism that opposes same-sex blessings. As the chair of the Sequoia Trust, he has funded both HTB and the Church Revitalisation Trust, whose stated goal is “the evangelisation of the nation”, with millions of pounds. And he is a funder of the HTB spin-off St Mellitus College, which by 2019 was training a quarter of all future clergy,according to Prospect’sin-depth analysis.Hope Not Hatealso reported that Marshall liked or reposted messages with crude anti-Muslim content: “there has never been a country that remained peaceful with a sizeable Islamic presence”, “If we want European civilization to survive we need to not just close the borders but start mass expulsions immediately” and “once the Muslims get to 15 to 20 per cent of the population, the current cold civil war will turn hot”. A representative for Marshall noted that the examples “represent a small and unrepresentative sample of over 5,000 posts. This sample does not represent his views.” And that, “all his posts have now been deleted to avoid any further misunderstanding”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Take no comfort from Farage and Robinson’s mutual detestation: Farage parades as “moderate” beside the violence that surrounds Robinson.But I believe they would collude as necessary.In their long-delayed choice of a new archbishop of Canterbury, the C of E needs an unhesitating opponent of Christian nationalism. There is a time for understanding, but this is a time for denouncing racist demagogues and shaming their supporters. However, that duty falls mainly on politicians, the government above all. Protecting borders from unregistered migrants is every government’s difficult task, but dithering over sympathy with Reform backers or even far-right protestors, not necessarily poor, only insults the great majority of the hard-up, who are at ease in mixed communities and don’t turn to the far right.Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Now he’s is back in a riveting role as a street kid robber and jailbird. The young star talks nepo babies – and playing posh whiteTue 23 Sep 2025 11.37 EDTLast modified on Tue 23 Sep 2025 14.29 EDTShareWhen some enterprising director gets around to making Pete Doherty: The Movie, Frank Dillane won’t need to audition. With his black leather jacket, bed-head and baby face, this could be the youthful Libertines frontman seated before me next to a potted plant in an east London cafe. Unlike the young Doherty, however, the actor’s drug of choice is a flat white. And he isn’t hell-bent on sabotaging his career. Not any more.After playing the haunted, drug-addicted Nick Clark in four seasons of the zombie TV spin-offFear the Walking Dead, Dillane, now 34, fled to Berlin for two years and turned his back on fame. A glance at some of the video interviews he did to promote the show is enough to explain why: he looks at best fidgety, at worst bored and resentful.I grew facial hair for the film but I shaved it all off. It spoilt the innocent effect – I looked like a cartel boss“Nick was a junkie, and my work on the show was all about understanding him,” he says, toying with the three gold rings on his right hand. “Then I’d be asked all these questions that trivialised what I’d done.” Behind the scenes, there were stern words about his behaviour. “I was told to talk differently, dress differently, attend media training.” Did he? “No. I was a young, bloody-minded artist!” Eyes crinkling, he gives a wheezy laugh. His Artful Dodger charm could disarm a warmonger.View image in fullscreenBad fit … Dillane as Nick in Fear the Walking Dead.Photograph: Justin Lubin/AMCThat hiatus in Berlin temporarily arrested his ascent. “Straight after Fear the Walking Dead was the moment to capitalise on everything and dothisfilm orthatfilm,” he reflects. “But I didn’t want it.”He does now. Fortunately, the perfect vehicle to relaunch himself, and to show off his range and sensitivity, has arrived in the shape of Urchin, the directorial debut of Harris Dickinson, star ofBabygirl. Dillane plays Mike, an unhoused Londoner ricocheting from pavement to prison to hostel. An odyssey that could have been punishingly bleak is redeemed partly by the actor’s sheer ebullience. Whether chancing upon a pair of snakeskin loafers in a charity shop, presenting his probation officer with a miniature cactus or belting out a karaoke rendition of Atomic Kitten’s Whole Again, Mike stays upbeat when the chips are down, which is most of the time.Even when he is bad, the good still peeks through: knocking a stranger to the ground, he mutters his apologies as he raids his victim’s pockets. “There’s a childishness that I wanted to achieve with him,” says Dillane, crossing one leg over the other and exposing pale pink socks worn with battered penny loafers. “Early on, I grew facial hair for the film, but then I shaved it all off. It spoilt the innocent effect when I looked like a cartel boss.”Genial he may be but Dillane is in no hurry to discuss his preparation for Urchin. He confirms that the begging scenes are authentic, shot on busy streets using a long lens: “People ignore you when you approach them. It makes you feel like you’re not human.” What he won’t reveal is whether he slept rough, as has previously been reported, or what sort of history he mapped out for Mike. “I want to keep that stuff to myself. You guys have the film.”When I inquire after the character’s body language, he lets out a mock-huff – “Fine!” – and admits that he did a drawing of Mike before shooting began. “I wrote a trauma in each joint. His right foot is held like that because of an injury. His leg is like that because of the time some girl rejected him. He holds his back that way from the stress of when he got shouted at. He’s carrying everything around with him.”At first, Dillane wondered if race might be an impediment to playing Mike. “I saw him as a white kid from an estate in England,” he says. “But my mum’s Jamaican so I don’t classify myself as white. I’ll often get cast as posh white people. The posh thing I’ll take. I’m not going to pretend I’ve had an upbringing like Mike.”View image in fullscreenOut for fun …… from left, Karyna Khymchuk, Dillane and Shonagh Marie in Urchin.Photograph: Everett/ShutterstockFar from it. After spending his early years in south London, he moved with his parents – actors Naomi Wirthner (Slow Horses) and Stephen Dillane (Sherwood, Game of Thrones) – to Forest Row, East Sussex, which was named Britain’s third poshest village in a 2023 Times poll. “Third poshest?” he gasps. “Third weirdest, maybe. There’s a lot of Scientology there.”Back to race. “I was the darkest person in the school when I got to Sussex. And I’ve had the experience of being paled up for roles, blue contact lenses, that kind of stuff. Like when I played Voldemort.”At 18, Dillane starred as the villain’s younger incarnation, Tom Riddle, the Teen Who Must Not Be Named, inHarry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince. He has since notched up numerous period roles, from a highwayman in Sally Wainwright’sRenegade Nellto a doctor inThe Essex Serpent. He will next be seen alongside Daisy Edgar-Jones in a new film of Sense and Sensibility, in which he plays Mr Willoughby. “He’s a car crash,” he says fondly. In an age before cars? “Yeah. A carriage crash!”It seems to have only just dawned on Dillane that he has spent much of his career in period dress. “I’ve done a lot of that stuff, haven’t I? Maybe I’m being shortsighted thinking that mixed-race people can’t do posh period roles.” He drums his hands on the table. “I feel like I’m unravelling as I’m getting into this with you. I should be talking to my therapist about it.”View image in fullscreenPeriod piece … Dillane as Charles Devereux in Renegade Nell.Photograph: Disney +The trick with capturing Mike, he discovered, was to see beyond race. “I had this idea of the human animal. Like, if you take a human being and remove their security, family, friends, home, then what are you left with? It’s all about humanity.” That shines through. No wonder he took home a best actor prize from the Un Certain Regard sidebar at Cannes this year.Any tension between the dire circumstances in which Mike finds himself, and his determination, verging on zeal, to make the best of things, is vital to the movie. It almost broke Dillane’s heart. “Mike’s thinking, ‘Everything’s going to be fine’. And then it isn’t. That was difficult to achieve. Harris had to keep reminding me: ‘This is an optimistic moment.’ For me, it’s all so sad, you know?” He gets a faraway look, his eyes gleaming with tears. “My experience of researching and working on the film was one of intense suffering. Not just personal suffering but the impotence of not being able to help people: their fragility, their addiction.”He talks passionately about inequality and the consolidation of wealth, and his time spent working for a homelessness charity long before he was cast in Urchin. I wonder how that sits with his education at the fee-paying Michael Hall school, which proudly posted about his Cannes win on its Facebook page. (The post earned 42 likes.)“Yeah, but I went to a Steiner school before that,” he says. “It was three caravans in a field. Also, when I went to Rada, the fee wasn’t what it is today. It’s really expensive now.” He mulls this over. “I guess it is kind of embarrassing. We all have our privilege. I do hold guilt for it, I suppose.” Then there is his status as a nepo baby. “Nep-oh-tism. It’s quite a nice word, isn’t it? Look, I dunno. Acting is just what my family always did. What doesyourdad do?” Finding that the answer isn’t journalism, he relents. “Maybe it’s different for writers.”Still, no one who sees Urchin could accuse Dillane of coasting on the family name. Playing Mike has fundamentally changed him, he insists. “My humanity is broader. I’m sorry to bring Jesus into this, but Jesus went among the lepers. He gave time, energy and love. Giving yourself to a situation, to a person, without the endgame of fixing them can be helpful. People want quick, simple solutions to complex problems like homelessness. But there aren’t any. Your willpower alone will not fix the world.”Urchin review – Harris Dickinson’s homelessness drama is a terrific directorial debutRead moreUrchin has also rejuvenated his career prospects. “I wasn’t engaging with any of it before in the way that, say, Timothée Chalamet does. He’s fucking on it, right? And he loves it. I see myself now as more like that. Talking to my agents, turning up looking neat, trying this and chasing that and la-la-la-la-la.”As we head off together into the drizzly afternoon, Dillane clutching a black satchel, he admits to being nervous when he strolled into the cafe an hour earlier. “I wanted to paint a good picture of myself and not dwell too much on my mistakes,” he says. “A lot of my existence now involves the older me coming to terms with choices that the younger me made: ‘You turned downwhat?’And: ‘I can’t go back and change that’ It’s like: ‘No. So now what do you do?’” The answer seems obvious. You do more good films. More films like Urchin.Urchin released on 3 OctoberExplore more on these topicsFilmTelevisioninterviewsShareReuse this content"

The quintet speak marginal or at-risk languages covering five continents, and their newly commissioned poems all speak to their sense of home.If we only have one colour and one paintbrush, that’s a disasterThe kohl concoction will spell out شلونچ؟ or “How are you?” in Arablish, a melding of Arabic and English, taken from a poem byHanan Issa, the half-Iraqi National Poet of Wales. Quebec-born writerNorma Dunning’s flag will bear the word ᑕᖃ, or “veins” in Canadian syllabics, made out of wild blueberries foraged from her home terrain. The piece, Seed Syllable, will welcome visitors toVoiced, Britain’s first arts festival celebrating minority and endangered languages, or what the Barbican calls an “explosion of creative multilingualism”. In February, the extravaganza will travel on to Manchester, one of the world’s 53 Unesco Cities of Literature “dedicated to promoting cultural diversity and literary richness”.Winston has been playing with language in his art for more than 20 years, including using cuneiform and Egyptian hieroglyphs in his celebrated picture bookOne and Everything– itself translated into 23 languages. His co-curator, poet Chris McCabe, is editor ofPoems from the Edge of Extinctionand founder of theEndangered Poetry Project. Based at London’s Southbank Centre, it invites the public to submit poems in threatened languages, collating them for future generations.Winston acknowledges the “sense of urgency and loss” –every two weeks, another language falls silentand by the end of this century, half of the world’s 7,000 tongues are expected to become extinct. But he was determined for this to be much more than a mournful symposium: “It is a festival and you want to have that playful and joyful element.”View image in fullscreenStrong words … a Sam Winston flag from Seed Syllable.Photograph: PR IMAGEAfter an opening event featuring Trainspotting authorIrvine Welsh, there will be workshops including interactive sessions on the 94 languages spoken across the London borough of Hackney, and how to create your own alphabet. The live literature programme will showcase dialect poetry (from Scouse toSylheti) and invented languages (fromKlingontoPolari).Throughout next month, there will also be the free-to-access Creative Voice Exhibition – an immersive area where you can contribute to a collaborative artwork by drawing, writing or rhyming your response to your favourite piece of language – and a family-friendly listening trail in which you can discover hidden languages using a map that will take you to quiet corners of the Barbican’s brutalist complex. “You’ll walk to different stations and you can hear all of these different communities,” says Winston. “It’s not really about language, it’s about how people get married and how people go fishing.”Winston grew up in Devon, Wales and Yorkshire as a dyslexic boy “suspicious of all these tiny black marks … It felt like language was something that was quite authoritarian,” he says. It was only at Camberwell College of Art that he made a breakthrough, on a design course learning about typography and letter form.“That experience of not being able to communicate what’s important to me, even in the English language, made me very sympathetic to a situation whereHawad” – one of the five poets, a Tamajaght-speaking artist from the Aïr region of Niger – “cannot share his language and his culture in a way that is supported by anyone beyond this small community. That made me an ally. It’s really important that we create spaces, and say these voices are valid.”What I would like is that you turn up and learn a lot about yourselfAt the heart of the “audio treasure hunt” by sonic artistJamie Pererais a piece titled Babel Reclaimed, in which a cacophony of hundreds of voices come together in perfect harmony. It was made in collaboration with linguistMandana Seyfeddinipur, director of theEndangered Languages Archive(a Berlin-based digital repository for “unique records of local knowledge systems encoded in their languages”), and came from her rejection of the Tower of Babel parable, about humanity speaking in a unified tongue.Some still regard the prospect of a single universal language – such as the 19th-century attempt to get the world to speak Esperanto – as a utopian ideal. Not Winston. “If we only have one paintbrush to paint in, and only one colour to paint with, that, from an artistic perspective, is a disaster.”He has not yet properly engaged with the languages of his mother’s Irish and father’s East-End Jewish ancestors, but has explored Tibetan through his meditation practice and Hangul via his Korean partner.“Language is an expression of being human, and that’s at the core of the festival,” he says. “You can turn up and learn about a lot of diverse cultures.

Alien: Earth’s ‘demon sheep eye’ is a work of true geniusSure, the xenomorph is an all-time great screen baddie – but it’s no match for the eyeball-octopus parasite stuffed in a sheep’s headStuart HeritageTue 23 Sep 2025 07.18 EDTLast modified on Tue 23 Sep 2025 13.15 EDTShareFrom the moment it was announced,Alien: Earthwas a bold punt. Ridley Scott’s movie (and James Cameron’s first sequel) painted the xenomorph as a classic baddie. It was unstoppable. It was seemingly unkillable. It was largely seen in flashes, and motivated only by death. Whenever subsequent movies attempted to broaden the alien’s mythology, its impact only diluted. So the thought of subjecting it to an entire television series – one designed to run for several years, no less – risked destroying it completely.‘Oh God no, Dad!’ The makers of TV’s most terrifying monsters reveal their repulsive secretsRead moreAnd yet Alien: Earth is a wild success. But this isn’t really to do with the xenomorph at all. Instead, almost every last atom of glory has been stolen by a new alien; one whose smarts, menace and weirdness trump almost anything the franchise has given us so far. Yes, it’s time to give the demon sheep eye its props.When the show was announced, the broad strokes of the plot – and all the promotional material – hinted at a series where a xenomorph would crash-land on Earth and run around murdering everyone for eight hours. This is partly true, but the show gambled on showing us some of the other extraterrestrial species that were captured in space at the same time.Key among them was trypanohyncha ocellus, a creature best described as a multi-irised eyeball bunged on to a set of octopus tentacles. Onboard the doomed spacecraft, the ocellus was able to sense danger and free itself from containment, unleashing untold horrors on its crew. In a flashback episode, we saw the ocellus burrow into the eye socket of its first host (a crew member played by Michael Smiley), giving him the intellectual ability to summon xenomorphs and (as seen in a battle where he hopped on to one’s back and bit it) the physical ability to cause them pain.However, as things stand, the ocellus’s definitive form so far has been the sheep. It has spent the bulk of the first season burrowed deep into the ocular socket of a regular woolly critter, which then became the most terrifying creature ever seen on television. Since being invaded by the ocellus, the sheep has done very little except stand in one fixed position, a parasitic eyeball bulging from the side of its face as it glowers menacingly at everything around it.View image in fullscreenUsurped … move over, xenomorph – there’s a new contender for the worst monster ever.Photograph: FlixPix/AlamyBut even with something as docile as a sheep for a host, the ocellus has unleashed havoc. It waited for an opportunity to ram the glass walls of its containment cell, distracting a scientist just long enough to be eaten. And, as of last week, we know that it can: a) identify pi to at least four digits; and b) poo when annoyed.The genius of the ocellus is how it stands in such stark contrast to the xenomorph. That creature is all instinct and reaction; this one waits and watches and coolly observes, figuring out the precise moment in which to cause maximum damage. What’s more, it is unquestionably malicious by design – and this is what makes it so utterly terrifying.Alien: Earth review – TV that bristles with bone-deep dreadRead moreIt should be noted that I am writing this before watching Wednesday’s finale. Based on last week’s episode, it seems as though the plan is to remove the ocellus from the sheep’s head and implant it into the head of a “lower IQ” human. We’ve already seen a hint of what it can do when nestled into a person’s skull, but the flashback episode did a fine job of obscuring many of its abilities. We know, at minimum, that it can talk to xenomorphs. But this is an ability shared with Sydney Chandler’s hybrid human, Wendy. How will a xenomorph react to two humanoids fighting for control of it? We should cross our fingers and hope that the finale is the Alien franchise’s Kramer vs Kramer moment.Beyond that, all bets are off. After all, given the devastation the ocellus has been able to wreak as a sheep, just think of all the horrors it could unleash on the world with a larger brain, communicable language and opposable thumbs.This is why the ocellus has been Alien: Earth’s secret weapon all along. A long-form television series cannot be sustained by the angry toddler histrionics of a xenomorph. But the ocellus can think. It can plot. It can evolve. It is a masterpiece of design and execution. And, providing nobody squishes it underfoot in the finale (which someone should probably at least try to), it is the alien that Earth most urgently needs to worry about.Alien: Earth is on Disney+ now. The finale airs on 24 September.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionAlienfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I discover it on muddy football pitches in east London, with the smell of chips drifting from the van at half-time; in rented cricket halls in Bradford where there is always a giant urn of tea bubbling in the corner. The sounds that have shaped me as a Black British person aren’t designed by algorithms or commissioned by labels. They come from battered speakers balanced on trestle tables, bhangra basslines rattling the walls of community centres in Southall and WhatsApp threads buzzing long after everyone has gone home.I remember attending a Somali football league in east London where the match ended but no one left. The players, still in muddy boots, piled into the clubhouse to eat rice from foil trays while a DJ wired up his decks at the side of the pitch. The final whistle had barely faded before Sneakbo’s The Wave ripped across the park, the chorus bouncing off the goalposts like an anthem and propelling players and families to move. A few weeks later, in Bradford, I was in a cricket club that had become a bhangra night. Aunties juggled trays of samosas and paper cups of tea as the floor shook to the pounding rhythm of British-Asian bhangra pioneersAlaap’s take on traditional Heer Ranjha, a song older than most of the crowd but carried with fresh force through second and third-generations. It wasn’t glamorous, but it was unforgettable. And here, too, the loop revealed itself. Sport gathered the people, music deepened the connection, and that connection made space for the next track, the next party, the next young talent.I also remember the first time a track reached me through a WhatsApp group that no algorithm would ever find. A cousin in Birmingham forwarded me a digitised cassette of Hasan Cihat Örter’s Sevgiye Zaman Ver, a Turkish instrumental that sounded as if it had been recorded underwater. The file had been passed from uncle to uncle across three countries before it landed in my phone. By the end of the week, it was soundtracking a Sunday league after-party in Walthamstow. That single song created a thread of conversations, remixes and even a teenager trying to sample it for a drill track.TikTok and Spotify may shape music popularity, but virality doesn’t just exist online. My phone is always pinging with new music from outside the algorithm and across the diaspora. Aunties send gospel remixes with laughing emojis, cousins drop raw Warsaw drill tracks such as Lola by Żabson and friends digitise Somali oud tapes that are not on any streaming platform. Within hours, a playlist builds itself out of scraps, memes and masterpieces. It is chaotic, but it is magic.What excites me most about these digital and real-life spaces is how generative they are, a cycle of care and creativity that the official industry cannot replicate, no matter how much data it crunches or how many trends it tries to chase. These networks recycle energy and form their own kind of musical infrastructure. Aunties book DJs to raise money for sports kit, then the cricket fundraiser doubles as a rave. Kids test their first bars at the end of a match and get cheers from a crowd who know their names. The applause gives them confidence to come back with another verse, another set, another story.And in a Britain where public spaces are shrinking and funding for youth centres and the arts gets cut year after year, these grassroots networks feel like resistance. They are proof that joy cannot be legislated out of existence. People will always find ways to gather, to dance, to share songs that make them feel alive.Yet too often, these diasporic exchanges and cultural networks are pushed to the margins of Britain’s mainstream music narrative. Despite their energy and influence, they rarely receive the same visibility or institutional support as other scenes that emerge with commercial polish or industry connections. Instead they are written off as niche or “local”, even as their sounds quietly shape the pulse of British music. That neglect matters, because it speaks to whose voices are amplified as part of the national story, and whose contributions are left unheard. For me, these networks are the reason I fell in love with music in the first place. They show me that you do not need slick studios or industry backing to build something that matters. You just need a room, some speakers, a crowd, and the will to keep going.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSleeve NotesFree weekly newsletterGet music news, bold reviews and unexpected extras.

I would point to the Morley’s fried chicken shops lit up after midnight, dancehall spilling from a car parked outside. The school sports days in east London where a Bluetooth speaker sneaks in under the teacher’s desk and suddenly the whole class is moving. The community centres that smell of carpet cleaner and curry where a DJ plugs into a socket that barely works. The football pitch that turns into a dancefloor once the floodlights go out. Because in these spaces, music and community do not just coexist. They create each other, over and over again. The future of our music is not written by algorithm.

They were almost doing a ‘prophylactic fascism’. They weren’t even waiting to be told to expel students and put down all protests … I guess you would have to go back to a McCarthy era to see this kind of obedience.”“All institutions are under attack,” she added. “I know of artists who have signed contracts to do commissions and these commissions have been either stalled or cancelled for anti-DEI reasons. So it’s really happening … I’m more than concerned, it’s getting a little scary.”The Royal Academy show will be the largest to date for Leigh, who is 57 but was in her 40s before the wider art world began to take note of her work, which was often in the form of ceramics that critics dismissed as a “material for hobbyists or studio potters”.She has had a meteoric rise over the past 15 years, becoming an artist whose work connected Black Lives Matter to older movements, while also chiming with the theory of African American public intellectuals such asChristina Sharpe.Leigh grew up in Chicago, attending an evangelical church where her father was the preacher, before going to college and eventually living in a yurt near Charlottesville, Virginia, with a group of would-be ceramicists.She said: “Because the show’s inLondon, it’s been making me hyper-focus what it means, my personal history, and what ties I have to London, which is really only through my parents, who were [born in Jamaica as] British subjects.”She often works with clay, sometimes casting models into other materials such as bronze. Her sculpture Brick House, made in 2019, sat on the High Line in New York, and waspart of The Milk of Dreams, the title of her Golden Lion-winning Venice Biennale show.The show’s curator, Tarini Malik, said: “In terms of representing the breadth of her career, there are only a few spaces that can hold her work in that way.”Leigh’s breakthrough moment came in 2012 with the You Don’t Know Where Her Mouth Has Been exhibition at The Kitchen in New York, which included Queen Bee (2008-2012), a “menacing chandelier conglomeration of black terracotta forms bristling with defunct TV antennas”.At Venice, Leigh hosted thesecond instalment of her Loophole of Retreatevent, where speakers, includingLorraine O’Grady, discussed everything fromblack feminist ideasto post-colonial theory, alongside performances. The first edition was held at theGuggenheim in New York, with queues forming at 8am.The third Loophole of Retreat will take place in London, with a UK curator who is yet to be named working alongside longtime collaboratorRashida Bumbray.The Turner Contemporary in Margate will show two of her sculptures – Bisi (2023) and Untitled (2023–24) – opening on 3 October and displaying until 15 March 2026.Explore more on these topicsArtRoyal Academy of ArtsLondonnewsShareReuse this content"

Emma (Amelia Kenworthy) is a serious-minded type, albeit still insufferably self-regarding and judgy. She has just failed her finals at Oxford University and is in a state of emotional meltdown when she returns home to begin meddling in the lives of all around her.Her sister, Isabella (Jessica Brindle), loves fake tans and Elton (Bobby Lockwood) is an oily estate agent in sockless loafers. Emma’s biggest critic and secret admirer, George Knightley (Kit Young), is a builder and brother to oafish John (Adrian Richards), who is getting married to Isabella. Mr Woodhouse (Nigel Lindsay) is still a widower but also a latter-day Del Boy furtively carrying on with Mrs Bates (Lucy Benjamin), a beautician, while Harriet (Sofia Oxenham), kooky and hapless in love, works in the local Co-op.The central class switch – from genteel society to estuary England – is an inspired stroke by Pickett but the script is laden with over-familiar Essex tropes, and you wish for the gimlet-eyed observation and texture of Austen’s world above this broadness. Where Pickett’s historical drama1536, staged at the Almeida theatre, resonated magnificently for our time, this seems strangely old-fashioned in its TV sitcom format, despite the modern updating.View image in fullscreenCarefully observed … Sofia Oxenham as Harriet and Amelia Kenworthy as Emma.Photograph: Marc BrennerThe book’s complex web of goings-on are streamlined, arguably for the better, but characters are gratingly exaggerated. That strips the pathos, so it is hard to feel for them as they contend with various romantic wobbles.Under Christopher Haydon’s direction, characters run in and out, trip, hide and snog comically. The action edges from social satire, of sorts, to full-on revolving-door farce and clowning, high-pitched and hysterical, in the second half.The pumping music and lights carry you along while Lily Arnold’s set design of a modern house with a Regency-inflected interior (creams, mint green, elegant stripes) brings subtlety that the script lacks.‘I don’t buy it’ … Ava Pickett on her play about Anne Boleyn’s treason and incestRead morePickett certainly captures the heart of a young, arrogant woman who has a “disposition to think too well of herself”, too. But her talk of patriarchy, feminism and consumerism is not sharp enough to serve as social commentary or satire. Her tips on empowerment are too quickly accepted by Mrs Bates, Harriet and John so that they act in unlikely ways – even within the bounds of a farce. And you do not quite catch the heat and smoulder of George and Emma’s sublimated desire until rather too late.There are some comic zingers and warm moments, Emma and Harriet’s close female friendship is carefully observed, and Kenworthy and Oxenham make spirited professional stage debuts. The few earnest scenes towards the end are so full of heart, emotion and impactful stillness that they reveal glimpses of what the play might have been beneath its head of froth.AtRose theatre, Kingston upon Thames, until 11 OctoberExplore more on these topicsTheatreJane AustenComedy (Stage)Comedy (Culture)reviewsShareReuse this content"

As itlimply explained: “Last Wednesday, we made the decision to suspend production on the show to avoid further inflaming a tense situation at an emotional moment for our country. It is a decision we made because we felt some of the comments were ill-timed and thus insensitive.”But now, apparently, all is well.“We have spent the last days having thoughtful conversations with Jimmy, and after those conversations, we reached the decision to return the show on Tuesday.”How lovely. How reasonable. How, well, kumbaya. All it took were some “thoughtful conversations with Jimmy” and everything returned to normal.Don’t believe it. In the days since ABC’s decision, the blowback against Disney has been hurricane level.Even if we can’t count on our elected politicians to protect our first amendment rights, we can rely on ourselvesAt least five entertainment industry unions, with at least 400,000 workers,spoke out, with the screenwriters’ union charging Disney with “corporate cowardice”.Celebrities Tom Hanks and Meryl Streepcalled out“government threats to our freedom of speech”.Kimmel was supported by his late-night peers including Stephen Colbert, Jimmy Fallon, Seth Meyers and John Oliver, all of whom blasted Disney and ABC with rapier-like humor.Jon Stewart devoted his show to a takedown of Disney’s cowardice.Disney talent was up in arms. Damon Lindelof, a creator of ABC’s Lost, threatened that if Kimmel’s show did not resume,he could not“in good conscience work for the company that imposed it”.Michael Eisner, a former Disney CEO, added a rare public rebuke.Even the rightwing Republican senator Ted Cruzexpressed concern, suggesting that Carr was speaking like a mafioso and calling his threats to retaliate against media companies “dangerous as hell”.“We should not be in this business,” Cruz said. “We should denounce it.”By Monday, Carr himself wasbusy minimizinghis role in the whole affair –denying he had threatenedto revoke the licenses of ABC stations (it “did not happen in any way, shape or form”) – and putting the onus on Disney for having made a “business decision” in response to negative feedback from viewers.America’s leadership class is failing us. It’s up to you and me to defend democracy | Robert ReichRead more“Jimmy Kimmel is in the situation that he’s in because of his ratings, not because of anything that’s happened at the federal government level,” Carr claimed.But the most intense pressure came fromus– from Disney viewers and customers – who immediately began to cancel subscriptions to Disney+ and Hulu and threaten a broader consumer boycott.Some celebrities, such as Tatiana Maslany, star of Marvel’s Disney+ series She-Hulk: Attorney at Law, and Rosie O’Donnell urged people to cancel their subscriptions.But the consumer boycott seems to have begun almost immediately.Shortly after Kimmel’s suspension was announced, Disney stock dipped about 3.5%. It continued to trade lower in subsequent days. The loss in market value has amounted to about $4bn.Investors got the message. Consumers were upset, which meant they’d buy fewer Disney products and services – which meant lower profits.There’s never one single reason for the ups and downs in the value of a particular firm’s shares of stock, but the timing here has been almost exact.Bottom line: we consumers have extraordinary power. We’re the vast majority. Like every other big corporation – especially one selling directly to consumers – Disney relies on us.Even if we can’t count on our elected politicians to protect our first amendment rights, we can rely on ourselves. When our outrage translates into withholding our consumer dollars, a big corporation like Disney is forced to listen – and respond.Next time you’re feeling powerless, remember this.Robert Reich, a former US secretary of labor, is a professor of public policy emeritus at the University of California, Berkeley.

Because the money thing, I forgot.”Protests against Disney’s suspension of Kimmel and canceled subscriptions to Disney products mounted as concern over free speech rights grew. High-profile peoplejoinedin the calls to boycott. Democratic New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani said he wouldn’t do a town hall on a local ABC channel,reversing courseafter Kimmel’s reinstatement.Some Republicans, including Ted Cruz and Rand Paul, also spoke out against the Federal Communications Commission’s chair pressuring Disney.“Here’s why Disney folded after Kimmel was suspended: Google searches for cancel Disney+ and cancel Hulu spiked,” Colbert said, “which explains why the other trending search was ‘how to entertain my child without Bluey’. So Disney put Kimmel back on because you, the American people, were upset.”Comedian Jon Stewart credited the boycott campaign of “pretending that you were going to cancel Hulu while secretly racing through four seasons of Only Murders in the Building”on his showon Monday night.“Wasn’t it interesting to try and figure out all the tentacles Disney has in your daily life?” Stewart quipped. “It’s one thing to swear off cruises, but the Avengers. How is it possible that by getting rid of one company, I can’t watch Winnie the Pooh or Monday Night Football or listen to early Hillary Duff?”Seth Meyerspointedto the “massive national backlash to Trump’s crackdown on free speech, even among conservatives”.“I haven’t seen a poll yet, but I think if you asked Americans if the president should be dictating what TV hosts can and can’t say, you’d get about 3% positive,” he said before playing a clip of Trump claiming that the coverage he receives is “97% negative”.Disney said it would bring Kimmel back on Tuesday, saying it had “spent the last days having thoughtful conversations with Jimmy, and after those conversations, we reached the decision to return the show on Tuesday”.In explaining its decision to take the show off the air, the company said it wanted to “avoid further inflaming a tense situation at an emotional moment for our country” and that some of Kimmel’s comments were “ill-timed and thus insensitive”.The suspension came after the FCC chair, Brendan Carr, threatened that the agency could come after outlets that aired Kimmel’s show after comments Kimmel made about Charlie Kirk’s shooter. Kimmel had said that the “Maga gang” was “desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them and with everything they can to score political points from it”. The comments came before charging documents alleged the shooter had left-leaning viewpoints.“But frankly, when you see stuff like this, I mean, look, we can do this the easy way or the hard way,” Carr said on a podcast. “These companies can find ways to change conduct and take action, frankly, on Kimmel or, you know, there’s going to be additional work for the FCC ahead.”Companies that hold the licenses for local channels that carry Kimmel’s show said they would pre-empt it, not airing it on the stations they own. Then, Disney said it would suspend Kimmel’s show indefinitely.However, not all stations in the US will broadcast Kimmel’s return.Sinclair Broadcast Group said it would not air the show on its ABC affiliate stations.“Beginning Tuesday night, Sinclair will be pre-emptingJimmy KimmelLive! across our ABC affiliate stations and replacing it with news programming,” said Sinclair, which has the nation’s largest number of the network’s affiliate stations.“Discussions with ABC are ongoing as we evaluate the show’s potential return,” the group said in a statement late on Monday.Another broadcast group,Nexstar, also said that it would continue to pre-empt the show.In a statement, Nexstar said: “We made a decision last week to pre-empt Jimmy Kimmel Live! following what ABC referred to as Mr Kimmel’s ‘ill-timed and insensitive’ comments at a critical time in our national discourse. We stand by that decision pending assurance that all parties are committed to fostering an environment of respectful, constructive dialogue in the markets we serve.”The actions of Nexstar and Sinclair combined mean that Kimmel’s show won’t air on almost a quarter ofABC’s affiliates.Explore more on these topicsJimmy KimmelWalt Disney CompanyUS politicsStephen ColbertJon StewartTelevisionTelevision industrynewsShareReuse this content"

It’s Alan (Partridge)– a new series featuring him returning to the UK having been doing promotional work in Saudi Arabia and attempting to rebuild his career through a documentary about mental health.It has been four years since Partridge last appeared on the BBC. Coogan says he and his co-writers bring the veteran presenter back when there is something to say about UK culture and society.The actor said Partridge was a “good conduit” to discuss “popular culture … and things that are difficult. Or say things that are perhaps taboo or would be difficult to talk about as … a private person.”“You [can] say things through the character or talk about stuff that’s potentially problematic,” Coogan said, adding: “It’s good to talk about stuff that is seen as taboo, not just to be provocative, but because you actually can, weirdly, shine a light on it and be more honest about it in some ways, by using Alan.“It feels relevant to do stuff which … gives people anxiety. It’s a way of talking about stuff that people can’t normally talk about. It’s a sort of Trojan horse.”He continued: “We highlight things by showing Alan’s small mindedness and prejudice, but sometimes he stumbles accidentally on shining a light on something, and can say that the emperor’s not wearing any clothes [and] say the unsayable.”Speaking at a screening of the new show in London, Coogan also said Partridge – who first appeared in 1991 Radio 4 series On the Hour – was now popular with gen Z, especially on TikTok, because, “that generation sees their parents in Partridge. They see that sort of trying to be relevant or not square, trying to be on message somehow, and that struggle of trying to be hip with their kids.”The show’s co-writers and directors, Neil and Rob Gibbons, said Partridge was also a “reflection of a lot of white, middle-aged, middle-class men of a certain age … the world’s changed too fast for them and they’re actually really scared [and] don’t really know what to do about it.”They added: “As soon as we started talking about Saudi Arabia, then we were interested.” During the series, Partridge is shown doing Saudi Arabia promos after work dries up after a disastrous stint hosting fictitious The One Show-style programme This Time.Coogan added he liked the Saudi scenes “because it makes me feel anxious watching it”.Partridge also reflects the concerns of some older presenters when he is shown panicking after accidentally playing an old audition tape of him doing an Asian accent.In a time when male hosts have lost their jobs due to their previous behaviour, Coogan said Alan would “definitely” be worried about being cancelled: “He feels the walls closing in, so he’s rapidly trying to think of an escape plan” by putting “on a millennial uniform”, shown by his attempt to tap into the trend for celebrities talking about mental health.“We have to build in to the premise ways that Alan can have jeopardy surrounded. So you have to give him a high wire. And mental health is obviously a subject that he knows very little about,” said Coogan.The character has also been given a domineering new girlfriend Katrina, whom he describes as, “one of the fittest women over 40 in Norfolk” and whom, the Gibbons brothers said, was originally based on Liz Truss.How Are You?

The punchline is long Covid, an illness that defies narrative – dissolves it. Patricia Lockwood’s new autofiction, Will There Ever Be Another You, is the product of that cruel dissolution. “I wrote it insane, and edited it sane,” she explained in a recent interview. The madness is the method. But must you know the mind before you can know the madness?Lockwood is the literary Frankenchild of Dorothy Parker and Flannery O’Connor: a heretical wit fused with gothic strangeness, vintage quippery rewired for the digital age. She’s the kind of writer who inspires parasocial devotion and copycat haircuts. Even her cats are internet-famous. The sacred text of Lockwood lore isPriestdaddy, her glorious 2017 memoir, which introduced readers to the American author’s trouser-resistant father, an ordained Catholic priest who blew his daughter’s college fund on a vintage guitar.The pandemic handed Lockwood a new absurdity. She contracted Covid early, in March of 2020, when transmission was blamed on grotty fingers and every doorknob was suspect – the era of fruit bleaching and handwashing jingles. She was among the first writers to give shape to the cognitive estrangement of the virus, its febrile illogic. “Hours, days of my memory had fallen out of my mind like chunks of plaster,” shewrote that July, as if the worst was behind her.Will There Ever Be Another You is the tale of what happened next, inflicted on a fictional Patricia: aphasia, hallucination, migraines, amnesia, paranoia, relentless self-obliteration. Can a novel carry that skull-fire without being consumed by it? That is the wager of this book.“What are you working on?” people kept asking me. Little stories, I would evade, and leave it at that, because if to write about being ill was self-indulgent, what followed was that the most self-indulgent thing of all was to be ill. But I was determined to do it. I was going to write a masterpiece about being confused.The result is cortical shrapnel – you can almost hear this book rattle when you open it. Lockwood’s title carries no question mark: it is prayer, punchline, eulogy, manifesto, nightmare, often all at once. Fragmentation is not a new mode for Lockwood (she was christened, after all, “the poet laureate of Twitter”). But it is one thing to disrupt, another to be disrupted. There is a new kind of anguish here, a longing for coherence.The book feels like the literary equivalent of a Wes Anderson film: over-styled and perilously close to self-parodyThe opening pages are where she comes closest. Hollowed by the loss of a child, an American family travels through Scotland, kept afloat by “pure itinerary”. A precious item is lost. Shortly afterwards, our heroine slips into fever. The treasure is returned; her mind is not. It feels like a dark enchantment, a faerie bargain. “It stole people from themselves.” Lockwood writes of her illness. “You might look the same to others, but you had been replaced.”Delirium reigns. We wheel from Roland Barthes to Cabbage Patch Kids, via Anna Karenina and the “butthole cut of Cats” (classic Lockwood territory). But there’s a drum of obsession beating underneath the chaos. Doppelgangers, changelings, clones, dolls; photographs and synonyms – these pages teem with replicants and replication. The modus operandi of a virus.It’s time to rouse the ghosts of Virginia Woolf and Susan Sontag: the patron saints of sicklit. Critics invoke Woolf to show how difficult it is to pin illness to the page (“English … has no words for the shiver and the headache”); Sontag to mark the grief of displacement (“the kingdom of the sick”). Woolf makes illness mystical; Sontag makes it ordinary. It has always been both. It’s time the conversation deepened. Our stories certainly have.A hundred years have passed since Woolf complained that literature ignored the body; now, it’s a site of wild and magnificent invention. Katherine Brabon’s novel Body Friend (2023) gives chronic pain human form, like an intimate version of Fight Club; Sanya Rushdi’s account of psychosis is so lucid it unsettles the very notion of madness (Hospital, 2023; translated by Arunava Sinha); Kris Kneen’s An Uncertain Grace (2017) is an orgy of transformations and transgressions: erotic, technological, and ecological. These are just three books within arm’s reach (all happen to be by brilliant Aussies).Across all forms and genres, writers are breaking taboos – of decorum, shame and syntax – to exalt in our corruptible flesh. There’s Ottessa Moshfegh’s metaphysical collapse (My Year of Rest and Relaxation), andHanya Yanagihara’s baroque trauma (A Little Life). Kazuo Ishiguro’s robots and clones; Jeff Vandermeer’s spores and mutations; the ravenous and rotting world of body horror. The body is no longer an absence, it’s a stage.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

We need accounts of long Covid, and plenty more of them. But Will There Ever Be Another You feels auteurish, the literary equivalent of a Wes Anderson film: over-styled and perilously close to self-parody. A delirious in-joke.Online and on the page, Lockwood’s brilliance has always been her ability to strip a joke back to its mechanics, and – somehow – make it sharper in the disassembly (see her viral poemRape Joke). But that power has begun to turn in on itself. Her first novel,No One Is Talking About This(a prequel of sorts), assumed a fluency in the language of the internet, known as “the portal”; Will There Ever Be Another You assumes a fluency in Lockwood.Fandom is the price of entry here: not just a familiarity with the cult author’s work, but with her life: her estrangements and griefs, her delights and obsessions, even the precarious state of her husband’s bowels. Maggie Nelson’s most recent book,Pathemata, read the same way: privileging intimacy over literacy. Nelson was also writing about chronic pain, and perhaps that’s no coincidence. Pain traps you deep inside your own brainbox; Will There Ever Be Another You recreates that trap. But how you read it – how you areableto read it – depends on your relationship to Lockwood. And this book assumes you already have one.Will There Ever Be Another You by Patricia Lockwood is published by Bloomsbury Circus (£16.99).

But anybody who’s anybody knows he goes by Boydy! Because of the time he once caught a ball, and ran around for a week, shouting, ‘I’m just like a real boy!’.”Like any jargon, it’s a system designed to dominate and exclude, dressed up in the language – not really language, more like mouth-noises – of the nursery, but reader, you do not have time to get irritated by this, because you will need all your resources of patience to get to the end of the sentence, without thinking: who cares whether he’s the 9th Duke of Marlborough? Who knows which century the 6th Duke was in? I bet the Spencer-Churchills don’t even know!In the end, the problem with any history of modern British aristocracy like Eleanor Doughty’s is not the implicit contempt of a class that believes in its own superiority to the extent that it considers the nicknames of its great-grandmother’s lurchers worthy of your time, yet will look you in the eye and tell you that hard work and merit are all that count – or to put that another way, piss on your shoes and tell you it’s raining.The problem isn’t even the posh-adjacent, their not-quite-aristo-enough army of admirers who’ll die on the hill of these people being fascinating, in which Doughty is an awesomely diligent officer. No, the real problem, from a narrative perspective, is that every sentence is loaded with so much extraneous information – where that character sits, not just in relation to the inheritance of their nearest stately home, but in relation to the queen, to their closest duke-by-marriage, to the second-cousin-twice-removed who would have pipped them to the pile were it not for his untimely death – that no amount of punctuation in the world can even rescue its syntax, still less hold your interest.So Henry “Master” Somerset, a notorious philanderer, “was asked at dinner by the wife of his heir presumptive, his first cousin twice removed David Somerset, who he considered the greatest man of the 20th century, [and] he opted, not for such an obvious figure as Winston Churchill, but Bernard Norfolk, ‘for his splendid work as chair of the Marylebone Cricket Club’.” The answer is maybefleetinglyinteresting but why does it matter who asked him? What’s David Somerset even doing in this sentence? Every story (and some of them could be diverting, there are some interesting deaths – in a biplane with a mistress; of alcoholism) is like watching a baby bird try to fly, except its tiny wings have been dipped in the cement of dynastic detail that tells you nothing at all about the human, yet is the only measure of his value.“Master” Somerset, by the way, wasn’t a good guy. “Pumped full of an extraordinarily exalted sense of self-worth and entitlement, he had little truck with good manners,” Doughty writes, going on to report a load of anecdotes in which Master is a prick. Effing and jeffing. Telling off proles for not moving fast enough, getting angry at dogs. In all this elaborate preservation of the bloodline, who bred out all the happy people?All that said, Doughty’s expertise jumps off the page. She started her career as a journalist on the Telegraph, and wrote their Great Estates column from 2017 (who even knew they had one of those? It’s like the Guardian and tofu, except their obsession connotes a value system that destroys its own young, whereas ours is just a tasty, proteinous ingredient). She knows everything – where an earl sits relative to a viscount, how many there are of each.

The balance of that can get quite thrown off,” Watson said.“I think I’ll be honest and straightforward, and say: I do not miss selling things. I found that to be quite soul-destroying. But I do very much miss using my skill-set, and I very much miss the art. I just found I got to do so little of the bit that I actually enjoyed.”Watson has been in the public eye since 2000, when she was first cast in the franchise adapted from JK Rowling’s books. Other key roles included Ballet Shoes (2007), My Week With Marilyn (2011), The Perks of Being a Wallflower (2012) and Sofia Coppola’s The Bling Ring (2013).She then starred as Russell Crowe’s daughter in Darren Aronofsky’s Noah (2014) and as Belle in the live-action adaptation of Beauty and the Beast (2017), before taking on the role of Meg March in Little Women.Although those three films were substantial hits, some of Watson’s other films were less successful, with 2016’s The Colonytaking just £47 at the UK box office.“The moment you get on a film set,” Watson continued, “you don’t get very long for rehearsal. But the moment you get to talk through a scene – or I got to prepare and think about how I wanted to do something – and then the minute the camera rolls, and getting to just completely forget about everything else in the world other than that one moment – it’s such an intense form of meditation. Because you just cannot be anywhere else.“It’s so freeing. I miss that profoundly. But I don’t miss the pressure. I forgot it was a lot of pressure. I did a small thing for a play, just with my friends. I was like, ‘Bloody hell, this is stressful!’ And that wasn’t even for a real public audience or anything. I don’t miss that.”Watson graduated from Brown university in the US with a degree in English literature in 2014 and is currently studying for a MSt in creative writing at Oxford. She remains an active campaigner for environmental justice and climate change mitigation and hasspoken outfor solidarity with the people of Palestine.Her stance on transgender issues has put her – as well as co-stars Daniel Radcliffe and Rupert Grint – indirect opposition to Rowling, and their ongoing feud continues to make headlines. The actor won the top prize at theinaugural genderless MTV movie and TV awardsin 2017.In her acceptance speech, Watson said the award “says something about how we perceive the human experience”.Along with her brother, Alex, Watson also runs a sustainable gin brand called Renais.“The most important thing, really – or the foundation of your life – is your home and friends and family. I think I worked so hard for so long that my life sort of bottomed out,” she toldHollywood Authentic.“The bottom fell out of the piece, which was actually me and my life. So I needed to go and do some construction work. Some good foundations for anything else to grow from. Because if you don’t have that, there’s a kind of mania that ensues; a kind of panic where you move from one project to the next, kind of terrified of the void in between them. You realise you don’t have a rhythm to your life.”Speaking to theFinancial Times in a 2023 interview, Watson said she “wasn’t very happy” with the acting profession and “felt a bit caged”.Explore more on these topicsEmma WatsonHarry PotterLittle WomenFilm industrynewsShareReuse this content"

Forget Dad’s signature childlike wonder; the youngsters in this post-apocalyptic outing – ostracised because minors are asymptomatic carriers of a plague that turns adults into cannibals – are completely feral, opportunistic and worryingly keen to kill. Spielberg’s film is a surprisingly nihilistic, if uneven, splicing of 21st-century young-adult and 1970s exploitation flicks.After making a break for the border, roving juvenile Mary (Zoe Colletti) takes up with a band of orphans squatting a nearby community centre. Leader Ben (Andrew Liner) is wounded during a botched armed robbery on a service station, so they take refuge in an isolated house. The unlikely owner is plummy, sardonic Brit Clara (Downton Abbey’s Michelle Dockery) – who stitches him up and deems that what these wastrels really need is a big plate of cookies. When the group wake up imprisoned in Clara’s attic, it should only reinforce rule number one: never eat the cookies.Mary is spared the sequestration because Clara views her as a potential replacement for her own daughter, part of the 1% of children who succumbed to the pandemic. So the youngster is installed in a flowery bedroom and forced to placate her captor like in Misery, and so the film enters into interestingly queasy gothic-fairytale terrain. But Spielberg balances it uneasily with the pure horror taking place upstairs, not quite satisfactorily constructing one or the other. As the group is shunted off one-by-one to a cold shower and an unspeakable fate in an adjacent room, the wan characterisation means the tension only intermittently smoulders. Breaking Bad’s Giancarlo Esposito periodically peps it up as a nosy sheriff.Please Don’t Feed the Children also has unfortunately frequent recourse to lazy storytelling shortcuts, with characters making ill-advised decisions or conveniently waking early from drug-induced stupors. But Dockery maintains rigour and bite at the centre as the genial jailer, and there’s an edginess to Spielberg’s direction, the camera roving around this posse of junior desperadoes and suggesting she may have inherited a certain cinematic intuition. But, like the abomination upstairs, she takes a ragged first bite here.Please Don’t Feed the Children is on digital platforms from 29 September and on DVD from 20 October.Explore more on these topicsFilmHorror filmsMichelle DockerySteven SpielbergreviewsShareReuse this content"

Perhaps not when they’re all hardened criminals and there’s a lot of money at stake. A quartet of robbers fresh from a heist hole up in a remote Dartmoor cottage in a grimy crime drama from music-video director Barnaby Roper, turning his hand successfully to feature films here.The gang’s leader is Ronnie, played byEddie Marsan, who unlike the others gets a voiceover, too, giving us a window into this veteran geezer’s thought processes. Marsan serves up the world-weary grit demanded by the character with aplomb; he can do this stuff in his sleep. More of a revelation is Sam Claflin, having an enormous amount of fun as a proper wildcard, the kind of loose cannon whose impulsive nature guarantees trouble. Claflin is more usually cast as a gentleman or dashing handsome hero and has played a posh version of this sort of character before, in The Riot Club; but he’s relishing the chance to work a rougher patch here.Torchwood’s Burn Gorman meanwhile turns in a splendidly oily performance as the accountant of the crew, while relative newcomer Tienne Simon in a quieter role gets a little lost by comparison. Perhaps Simon’s part is a shade underwritten in comparison to the others, but it doesn’t help that everyone is dialling it up to 11 as if they are trying to reach the back row of the main stage at the National Theatre. Indeed, much of the film unfolds like a kind of low-rent Harold Pinter play. Crime doesn’t pay, they say, and this low-key compelling chamber piece emphatically agrees.All the Devils Are Here is on digital platforms from 26 SeptemberExplore more on these topicsFilmThrillersCrime filmsEddie MarsanSam ClaflinreviewsShareReuse this content"

But on the evidence of this, Stallone is already letting the side down – by making a film so bad it shames American cinema itself. And it wasn’t even made in Hollywood! Instead, it was shot in Ohio (pretending, deeply unconvincingly, to be Poland), making this what’s called a runaway production, the phenomenon that is undermining Hollywood’s film-making industry.However, this cheapola would-be spy thriller is bad all on its own, whatever its politics. The idea is that secret agents Joe (Scott Eastwood) and his supposed antagonist Lara (Willa Fitzgerald) meet-cute in Prague (the real thing, shown in what looks suspiciously like stock aerial footage) while trying to kill each other, but instead they fall in love and get married. Five years later, Joe has seemingly retired from the spy business, but Lara is still working for an independent, territorially unattached agency called Alarum who supply her with what looks like a fancy pager to communicate with headquarters.Joe and Lara are near Gdańsk (the Ohio version) on holiday when a small aircraft falls out of the sky. Joe does a quick field autopsy to remove a thumb drive from one of the dead pilots, and soon a whole bunch of “Polish” soldiers led by Orlin (Mike Colter) descend on the area, shooting everything in sight. Separated from Lara, Joe makes his way to a town where he meets Chester (Stallone), a former colleague of Joe’s so grizzled he can barely move the muscles in his face; Chester pretends to be friendly but is secretly packing syringes full of deadly toxins. And, of course, he also has lots of guns.The film-makers at least paid up for a visual effect that created a small cloud of blood that poofs into the air, dainty as a mushroom spreading spores, whenever anyone got shot, which is often. The hand-to-hand combat sequences are even less convincing, featuring as they do a legion of disposable extras, their faces mostly masked so you can’t tell if it’s the same half-dozen people. Meanwhile, DW Moffett holds court in an empty warehouse as the agency director, and has explicatory conversations with his minions or answers the phone to growl at Joe or Chester. Even the quips are dismal.Mission Alarum is on Prime Video from 27 September.Explore more on these topicsFilmAction and adventure filmsSylvester StalloneThrillersreviewsShareReuse this content"

I never got Hula Hoops in my packed lunches because my Polish mum would give me cucumbers and I hadn’t seen High School Musical because we didn’t have Sky. Without those two major assets, you had to find a “thing” and mine became trying to make people laugh. I made a YouTube channel when I was 14, then eventually worked at the Edinburgh fringe when I was 18, and saw some amazing standup. I also saw some really bad standup. I thought: well, I can definitely do that!What’s been one of your all-timefavouritegigs?I did one where the average age of the audience was over 70. I decided to do some material about a vibrator and they absolutely loved it. A 92-year-old gave me some tips on the different settings.With all the prestige surrounding the Cambridge Footlights, did it meet your expectationswhen you were a member?It was definitely a mixed experience, some massive highs and some major lows which I won’t go into because this is a comedy interview. It was a huge privilege to not only be at Cambridge in the first place but also to get to practise a lot there. But a system like Footlights is at risk of producing a very samey, repetitive type of comedy, especially when the committee is dominated by white men, as it was when I was a fresher. In my second year I co-founded Stockings, a comedy society for women/non-binary performers which held workshops as well as open mics that you didn’t have to audition for to try to help create some new, less intimidating spaces and encourage different voices to participate. By the time I was on the Footlights committee, there were lots of conversations that were well overdue happening about representation and diversity there, and I hope things were changed for the better.Do you have a comedyhero?Jack Black in School of Rock is just wow. Robin Williams in Mrs Doubtfire, too. These are some funny guys!Do you have aheronot from the world of comedy?The team behind Colin the Caterpillar for their commitment to deliciousness and relentless innovation (see:Colin the Caterpillar rucksacks).Any bugbears from the world of comedy?Reviews. They can sometimes be useful in helping people decide what they might enjoy seeing but there are limitations and lots of context to them, and who writes them. If you’re a comedy goer, try to find a reviewer you share taste with, rather than just reading whatever comes out! I also recommend some less mainstream reviewers, such as Zoë Paskett and her newsletterLMAOnaise. I’d quite like for comedians to be able to review their reviewers. Obviously I’ll erase this answer if my next show gets exclusively five stars.View image in fullscreen‘I generally just try to write truthful comedy about stuff that scares or embarrasses me’ … Ania Magliano.Bestheckle?Any time a clip of mine goes viral it’s always well worth checking the comments section for the actual comedy gold. Recent highlights include “Who allows these women to speak into microphones?”, “She has a deep delusion” and “She is a bit strange I think.” I’d love to connect with these men more because I’ve never felt so seen.Can you recall a gig so bad, it’s now funny?My first ever gig was to two old men in an Arsenal-themed pub who were just trying to have a quiet pint. I did a lot of material about the concept of AirPods. Needless to say, it got absolutely nothing. The story isn’t that funny now, but it’s definitely funny that I confidently continued with a career in comedy after that.You’re on the new season ofTaskmaster. Tell me something that surprised you about the show?The first time you watch the tasks back in the live studio recording, it’s really challenging to see Alex Horne doing it with four other people. It’s like finding out he’s having four affairs behind your back … Alex, if you’re reading this, I thought what we had was special?Ania Magliano: ‘I have quite a lot of jokes about men being violent. There’s a dark undercurrent’Read moreWhat inspired yourforthcoming show,Peach Fuzz?My shows tend to reflect what’s been going on in my actual life in the past year or so. I’ve been trying to feel more connected to my body and less like a brain in a jar so there’s some stuff about that. I’m also on a journey of trying to figure out what I actually want in all areas of life. But to be fair a lot of it has come from watching videos of Sabrina Carpenter online and being fascinated by just how different we are. I generally just try to write truthful comedy about stuff that scares or embarrasses me to talk about because that is where the juice is.Do you have any regrets?I regret letting my hobbies slip. When comedy went from hobby to job, I never replaced it. But hobbies are good for the soul. I’ve just started a badminton WhatsApp group: 34 members strong and we haven’t managed to organise a game yet.What are you most excited aboutright now?I’m starting to paint again. Taskmaster made me remember how much joy I get from being creative (despite everything Greg said). When I didn’t do art GCSE, it just got dropped from my life, but it shouldn’t have been. You don’t have to be good at everything. I am going to lean into the fact that most of the paintings I start with will be shit and offensive. So I’ll probably just paint Greg.What have youlearnedfromstandup?Laughter is a nice thing. It can be easy to forget when it becomes your job, but fundamentally I think laughter can be such a connecting force (when used correctly) and help you feel like you’re not so alone in the world – both as audience and as comedian.Ania Magliano: Peach Fuzz ison tourfrom 6 FebruaryExplore more on these topicsStageComedy Q&AComedy (Stage)TaskmasterComedy (Culture)TV comedyTelevisionEdinburgh festivalfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I enjoyedEric Idle’s touring “one-man musical” very much: he seems like a thoroughly good egg, he’s led a remarkable entertainment life, and who’d begrudge him, now 82, the chance to bask in it – and his audience’s palpable affection – at least one more time? But even I found it a bit much when, reaching the end of this greatest hits compendium, Idle includesMonty Python’s 2014 O2 gigsin his pantheon of past glories. A show for nostalgists warmly recalling an earlier show for nostalgists? Welcome to entertainment in the age of the never-ending showbiz afterlife.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.In fairness to Idle, this show (called – what else? – Always Look on the Bright Side of Life, Live!) is not about Python, it’s about him, from South Shields childhood via boarding school in the Midlands, all the way to the Hollywood Bowl. It follows the now familiar format, with our host narrating his life and works in story, lots of clips on an upstage screen – and in song. A certain self-centredness is unavoidable with such shows, but Idle offsets that better than most, dedicating a substantial slice of the evening – and two sentimental songs – to sorely missed friends George Harrison and Robin Williams.‘I’d be proud to be thrown out of America!’ Eric Idle on Trump, life after Python and not talking before lunchRead moreRarefied name-dropping of the type indulged in tonight (a King Charles here, a Mick Jagger there) can sometimes pall. But it’d be hard for Idle to tell his tale otherwise, as we follow him from university revue with Bill Oddie and Tim Brooke-Taylor, to domestic comedy stardom with Python and “mock’n’roll” icon status in the US. We see him hosting Saturday Night Live next toJohn Belushi. We hear how Elvis Presley’s girlfriend told our starry-eyed host how Presley performed Idle’s sketches in bed.Happily, Idle retains a personality that seems immune to pomposity. Call him the anti-Cleese: his erstwhile bandmate receives a good-natured ribbing tonight. We get a handful of Python sketches onscreen (Nudge Nudge; the Queen Victoria Handicap), and a clip of the interview when the team “accidentally” spilled Graham Chapman’s ashes on live TV. We also get a long medley ofhis Beatles spoof the Rutles, an extract from his supposed Diary of a Legend, mocking his national treasure status, and a performance (in virtual duet with American clown Puddles) of his cosmos-sounding Galaxy Song from the Python’s 1983 film The Meaning of Life.No profound meaning of life is ventured by this octogenarian tonight, in what Idle jokes might be the last time we hear from him – not only because he might die soon, but because his audience might, too. But, in a show with an unmistakably elegiac undertone, Idle does conclude that his job has always been simply to cheer people up – cue a rendition of the signature song that’s helped us all digest life’s gristle for 46 years now and counting. If at times it’s not just nostalgia but nostalgia-squared tonight, at least Idle has a lot worth being nostalgic about.AtPavilion theatre, Bournemouth, on 24 September andRoyal Albert Hall, London, on 27 SeptemberExplore more on these topicsComedyEric IdleMonty PythonJohn CleesereviewsShareReuse this content"

So it’s right up there.”In thepast decade Duffy’s image of Bowie has been seen by thousands of people around the world. The Duffy archive loaned the Aladdin Saneartwork to the V&Afor its world-touringDavid Bowie Isexhibition.The V&A’s exhibition was the museum’s most visited international touring show in its 165-year history.About 312,000 visitors saw it in Londonbefore it travelled to Toronto, São Paulo, Berlin, Chicago, Paris, Melbourne, Groningen in the Netherlands, Bologna, Tokyo, Barcelona and New York. Last week, theV&A East Storehousein London opened a new Bowie archive.The photograph was also the centrepiece of the Southbank Centre’s exhibition to markthe 50th anniversary of Aladdin Sane in 2023, with Duffy’s son, Chris, calling the image “the Mona Lisa of pop”.Chris Duffy told the Guardian that the famous flash across Bowie’s eyelid was originally a tiny emblem on his cheekbone before his father stepped in, “grabbed some lipstick to draw an outline of a much bigger flash … and Aladdin Sane was born”.It was not only Duffy’s innovation that brought the image to life. The Stanley Kubrick collaborator Philip Castle, who worked on theA Clockwork Orange posters, airbrushed Duffy’s photograph, adding the watermark on Bowie’s shoulder and touching up his eyelashes.“It’s a dye transfer print, which is basically one of the highest-quality types of prints that you can do,” said Tole-Moir. “And at the time of its creation in 1973, it was the most expensive process that was really, really costly. So to have created it at that time was already a privilege.”Duffy had a long working relationship with Bowie, and also shot album artwork for Lodger and Scary Monsters (and Super Creeps) albums.The sale will open on 22 October.Explore more on these topicsDavid BowienewsShareReuse this content"

Queer kisses, shamanistic gurgling, miles of VHS tape and lasers in the jungle. This year’sTurner prizeexhibition opens this Saturday at Cartwright Hall in Bradford, the current UK city of culture.A soundtrack of a 16th-century Lutheran hymn and peals of church bells create an unresolvable conflict with the small photographs trapped behind glass on a low shelf inRene Matić’s installation. The voices of Nina Simone and bell hooks are dragged from the ether, along with the chants of trans rights activists and commuters calling for a free Palestine. Rihanna sings Lift Me Up a cappella as I go from snapshot to snapshot, looking for the story amid the club scenes and marches, the street graffiti and a baby in a bath. Here’s an elderly man in hospital, then lipstick and cigarettes and a page from a remembrance book: “Dad, Our Hero, VIP, Legend” reads the dedication.All these scenes, I take it, are from Matić’s life. It is all a mix of the personal and the political. I think of Nan Goldin and of a life being lived and documented. The artist, 28, displays their affinities in an installation that feels at once rich and sparse, restrained and confessional.View image in fullscreenRene Matić: mixing the personal and political.Photograph: David Levene/The GuardianBehind me, a huge printed cotton drop-cloth sags in space, as if it has run out of energy, or belief, or something. NO PLACE reads one side, FOR VIOLENCE, the other. Although repeating the calls for peace in response to the assassination attempt on Donald Trump’s life while he was on the campaign trail in 2024, there’s more than one way to read the banner. The private and the public, what’s background and what is foreground in the mixed race, gender fluid, working-class artist’s life? Peace and protest, friendship and family are all mixed together, along with contested ideas of nationhood and belonging. And what of Matić’s collection of black dolls, staring from their shelves, set into a pinkish brown wall? It all adds up to a frozen autobiographical tableau, suspended and ambiguous, like that banner, caught in the middle of things.Equally unsettling and deliberately ambiguous,Mohammed Sami’s paintings intimate violence. Broken crockery under an exploding sky. Clothing suspended in water, like the last view of someone drowning in a tank. A horseshoe-scuffed and trampled patch of ground where something or someone has been dragged from a field of sunflowers. A vast panoramic view of wind-thrashed palms in an orange haze, where green lasers blitz the undergrowth. It’s like a frozen screen in a stalled video game.An abandoned table and chairs are caught by a surveillance camera overhead, the view obstructed by the menacing shadow of a thwapping ceiling fan. Sami showed several of these heavily worked canvaseslast year, hung among the old masters and heirlooms at Blenheim Palace, a collision of past imperial might and modern violence, by an artist who began his career paintingofficial portraits of Saddam Hussein in Baghdad.View image in fullscreenMohammed Sami: too much painterly heavy breathing.Photograph: David Levene/The GuardianSami has always been good, like Luc Tuymans, at intimating catastrophe and violence in his unpeopled paintings, but it strikes me that his recent work has become technically a lot more tricksy, in the manner of Anselm Kiefer and Miquel Barceló. All that painterly heavy breathing gets in the way, and the more Sami does, the less I believe in it.Here come sounds again. This time, tinkling bells, whale song and radiophonic whoops, wind-chimes and the insistent warble of an old telephone. I was backing out of Vancouver-born Korean artistZadie Xa’s installation even as I shuffled across the shiny gold metallic floor in my specially provided overshoes, so as not to spoil the perfect sheen. The sounds all emanate from dangling giant artificial seashells. Undersea light drifts across the walls and tiny shamanic bells hang in a conch-like spiral over an octagonal dais shimmering with rainbow reflections, the whole thing mirrored in the floor under my feet.View image in fullscreenZadie Xa: overwrought and overthought.Photograph: David Levene/The GuardianThe paintings that line the walls are rife with folkloric Korean figures, skeletal musicians, swimming dolphins, passing squid and sea-turtles. This woozy, overwrought and overthought exercise in luxury brand shamanism is as excessive as it is unnecessary. The title, Moonlit Confessions Across Deep Sea Echoes: Your Ancestors Are Whales, and Earth Remembers Everything, says it all.Everybody’s got a spiel nowadays, and Xa’s is particularly unctuous. Everyone also has a story, as if that might explain everything. Ten large sculptures hang in space, melding and separating as you move around and between them.Nnena Kaluworks by repetitive binding and wrapping, knotting and furling, layer on layer, working on simple armatures with adhesive tapes, clingfilm, repurposed plastics, fabrics, cable ties, VHS tape, cardboard and spillage of manufactured, spun and extruded materials. Her additive, repetitive process depends on the artist’s reach, her concentration and persistence. Her sculptures are always the same and always different. They rise above us, reaching out or snarling in on themselves. They’re bound and unbound and filled with variety. These embodied forms have a complex physicality. I think of heads and torsos, arses, necks, bellies and manes, the human and the animal. They bulk and extrude, twist and float.People often talk of this or that artist being a force of nature, and of being driven. Neither artistic gifts nor disabilities are to be dismissed, as necessary as they are a hindrance. Born in Glasgow in 1966 Kalu is an autistic, learning disabled artist with limited verbal communication. Supported by visual arts organisation Actionspace, Kalu’s primary assistant, Charlotte Hollinshead, has worked with her since 1999, and describes her role as “a glorified assistant”, insisting that Kalu has total control of her art.Her work is irreducible. There’s a horizon to what we can know. Kalu’s sculptures have been compared to Phyllida Barlow and the fibre art of Sheila Hicks. One might also think of the complex, many-layered sculptures of American artistJudith Scott(1943-2005), who also worked with severe physical and mental limitations, finding her way after years of institutionalisation and neglect. Repetition and compulsiveness were also at the root of the immense corpus of work made by German artistHanne Darboven(1941-2009), who worked within rigorous self-imposed systems and constraints.View image in fullscreenCompelling … Kalu at work.Photograph: Courtesy of the Artist and ActionSpaceKalu works between the elective and the given. This is as true of her drawings as it is of her sculptural works. The repetitive spiralling vortices of her drawings all depend as much on where she leaves off, on their returns and alterations, on flow and variation, as they do on the body transcribing its actions on to paper. They are riotous and rhythmic, purposeful and compelling. There’s no fudging. Kalu deserves to win this year’s Turner prize.Turner prize 2025 is at Cartwright Hall Art Gallery,Bradford, from 27 September to 22 FebruaryExplore more on these topicsTurner prizeArtBradfordInstallationSculpturePaintingreviewsShareReuse this content"

But whenRembrandtdid it, it was “emulation” – a display of his craft, experts have said, as they revealed research pointing to an image in one of the Dutch master’s most famous paintings believed to have been inspired by another artist’s work.The Night Watch, Rembrandt’s 1642 masterpiece showing the citizens of Amsterdam marching out to defend the city, features a barking dog in the right-hand corner that is largely copied from a popular drawing by a lesser-known Dutch artist, it has been claimed.An academic paper by Anne Lenders, a curator at the Rijksmuseum, points out the many similarities between the Night Watch’s dog and a canine illustration on the title page of a 17th-century guide on how to defend oneself against sexual temptation.Taco Dibbits, general director of the Rijksmuseum, told the Guardian that – just like Shakespeare – Rembrandt drew widely and shamelessly from earlier sources.The dog in The Night Watch was copied from a drawing by another artist, it has been claimed.Photograph: Rijksmuseum“You see that in Italian treatises on painting in the 16th century, it really was the intention that you as a starting artist would copy a lot, make it your own, so that you could improve on it and continue the work another artist had left behind,” he said. “Rembrandt wanted to compete with the Italian masters, Raphael, Titian and Michelangelo. Now, you might call it plagiarising or copying but it really was not in that time – it was called emulation.”Lenders, a curator of 17th century art involved in thepublic renovationof the Night Watch, said she had realised Rembrandt’s source when she visited anexhibitionin the Zeeuws Museum in Middelburg last year.“I was just walking through the rooms and suddenly my eye fell on a book by Jacob Cats featuring a dog,” she said. “[The Dutch artist, poet and publisher] Adriaen van de Venne had made this drawing for the title page, and that is where the dog is shown but in a mirror image.”She was immediately reminded of the Night Watch, looked up the image on her phone and decided to study it further. The chalk underdrawing of the Night Watch – revealed in recent hi-tech scans – showed even more similarities, she added.In the final painting, Rembrandt gave his dog a more active position and imagined it barking with his tongue out.“Barking dogs don’t have their tongue hanging out of their mouth, but that is the case here,” said Dibbits, adding that the animal was also unlikely to have been so close to an animal skin drum: “Dogs are often very afraid of drums.”However, it was a device to bring action to one corner of the painting, said Lenders. “It is fascinating how [Rembrandt] put him in a corner in the shadows, to make it more exciting and insert a moment of action,” she said.Born in Delft in 1589, Van de Venne went on to become a versatile painter of the Dutch Golden Age and although he never achieved the acclaim of Rembrandt, he was popular. The work he did with Cats, a poet and thinker best known for his moralistic Emblem books, made him particularly well-known to his contemporaries.Explore more on these topicsRembrandtNetherlandsnewsShareReuse this content"

You can sample it in a “multi-sensory reflective space” created to display a Monet landscape lent by the National Gallery, one part of a constellation of exhibitions and events centred around the question: Can We Stop Killing Each Other? But by this point the only question I was asking is, why did I fall for it and make the trip to this glass house on the University of East Anglia campus?Jago Cooper, its director, is full of bright ideas. He’s set out to inject energy into the home of the Robert and Lisa Sainsbury Collection with such wheezes as declaring all its artworks to be “alive” – and staging shows around Big Questions of Our Time. Maybe this particular question is too big, but I think if it had been broken down and some logical clarity applied there might have been something to say – instead of saying nothing, which is what this windy absence does.Monet’s beguiling 1872 painting The Little Arm of the Seine at Argenteuil, which depicts a foggy day in the French countryside, is supposed to make us reflect on peace (but what if the light on the river interests me more?) in a setting the Centre seriously claims is a prototype “to develop and research trauma-informed cafes as part of the Sainsbury Centre’s Compassionate Museum programme”. But all the Monet room really does is typify the way random elements have been thrown together here with nothing but gibberish to tie them together.View image in fullscreenPeaceful reflection? … Monet’s The Little Arm of the Seine at Argenteuil, 1872.Photograph: Copyright The National GalleryEqually mystifying is Anton Forde’s Tiaki Ora, a gathering of wooden monoliths in the bright ground floor space. There is a historical and anthropological backstory but it makes no visual difference. Humanoid, figurative yet slipping into sacred-seeming abstraction, the carvings stand in a triangular formation with potted plants between them. To look at and walk among them, the effect is as bland as a garden centre.Sadly, in art as in music, the devil has the best tunes. Another exhibition, Eyewitness, is a survey of the dramatisation of killing in art, cinema and other global cultural forms. It sounds meaty but drifts into irrelevance. How can you have an exhibition about images of violence that does not gratify some need or desire to see violence? – the curators appear to have wondered. You can’t, and its only good moments are gory ones. Hogarth’s Four Stages of Cruelty prints, in which the brutalisation of a youth on the streets of 18th-century London leads him to kill a woman before being judicially killed himself and disembowelled by anatomists is shown beside Mat Collishaw’s photographs of the last meals chosen by prisoners on death row in the US. Arranged and lit like Dutch still-life paintings, these reconstructions of actual last meals chosen have devastating pathos.View image in fullscreenDevastating pathos … Mat Collishaw’s Last Meal on Death Row, Texas; Martin Vegas (framed).Photograph: Courtesy the artistBut that’s all too disturbing. Next up is a section on puppet theatre in India, then a ponderous display of Punch and Judy puppets. Things get even more eccentric and timid with a section on Shakespeare in which there are lots of cardboard cutout characters, toy theatres and third-rate Victorian paintings of tragic characters. It is impossible to fathom why any of this belongs in an exhibition about violence.At least Christian Marclay’s video installation Crossfire has violence in it. You stand surrounded by four screens, with clips of Hollywood gunfire all around you, caught in the crossfire. But coopting it as a condemnation of Hollywood violence risks exposing a shallowness in the work. Crossfire removes the context to make the shooting comically inane, but is movie violence always meaningless or can it in fact (as in Shakespeare) have dramatic power and truth? Marclay uses the final frames of Martin Scorsese’s Goodfellas with Tommy shooting at the audience. But Scorsese is a serious, moral artist, his use of violence a long way from meaningless. You would learn far more about human evil from watching Goodfellas at home.Then Eyewitness is over and there is another show by Ethiopian painter Tesfaye Urgessa, whose impassioned depictions of the human figure have nothing to do with the theme of violence. The wall texts make a vague link, but by this time this megalomaniac dream of solving global problems with puppets and toy theatres had lost me. It is utterly bonkers.Can We Stop Killing Each Other? is atSainsbury Centre, Norwich, until 17 May 2026Explore more on these topicsArt and designExhibitionsreviewsShareReuse this content"

A new podcast uncovers the sinister side of what happens when Brits throw things awayDaniel Dylan WrayTue 23 Sep 2025 04.55 EDTLast modified on Tue 23 Sep 2025 05.04 EDTShareOn his way to a remote industrial zone at the edge of Istanbul, Adnan Khan compares it to something out of Mad Max. Packs of wild dogs roam around desolate wastelands; toxic chemicals spill out into the street, with corrugated metal sheets and “slapdash factories” scattered around. “It’s like a shantytown,” he says.However, once he sets foot inside some of these factories, he reaches for a different cinematic comparison. This time he’s thinking of the torture-horror filmSaw, as he witnesses Afghan refugees working and living in conditions that he says fit the UN definition of modern-day slavery.Khan, a journalist, had been visiting three young men working in a factory – Samim, Hayat and Khalid – every week as he researched a story about refugee workers in the recycling industry. Then one day in 2022, Hayat asked Khan: “Did you hear what happened to Arifullah Fazli?” He showed Khan a photo on his phone of a young man who worked in a different factory. It was a harrowing image: a lifeless body, legs missing, laid out on the floor surrounded by piles of trash. He had been killed in an accident involving a recycling compactor machine.“The moment I was shown his body was such a shock,” says Khan. “The story became much bigger.”View image in fullscreenArifullah Fazli (left) with a friend in the mountains in eastern Afghanistan.Photograph: Unknown/Courtesy Adnan Khan via Afghan refugeesThe ensuing investigation has resulted in a three-part podcast series, Boy Wasted. It is produced by the team behind the BBC’s award-winning investigative podcast,Buried, and published by the environmental news titleENDS Report and the Dutch magazine De Groene Amsterdammer. It reveals that Afghan refugees are not only being exploitedby unscrupulous recycling factory owners, living in fear of deportation with no power or agency and working in perilous conditions – they are also dying at alarming rates while sorting through our rubbish. The UK exports thousands of tonnes of plastic waste to Turkey every year.“We thought we were looking into one mysterious body,” says Dan Ashby, one of the podcast’s producers and hosts, along with Lucy Taylor and Khan. “But what emerged was a whole broken system that is full of criminality and death.”As part of the investigation, the organisation İSİG Meclisi, which tracks workplace deaths inTurkey, carried out the first ever analysis of workplace deaths in Turkish recycling. It revealed deeply troubling findings. The researchers discovered that two people are crushed, ripped or burned to death in the recycling sector every month, and this has been the case for the last decade.“I just couldn’t believe it when these numbers started coming out,” says Ashby. “More than 200 boys and men have died in the last 10 years. So it then became an inquiry into: what are we doing with our plastic? What kind of workplaces is this enabling? What kind of organised crime is there?”The rubbish industry is a huge one. “Britain’s biggest export is waste,” says Ashby. “That’s what we make the most of now.” It has become so vast and profitable – and in many cases unregulated and unchecked – that one Environment Agency worker who features in the podcast describes it as being like “the wild west” and says that “waste crime is the new narcotics”. It’s a mammoth task to tackle.“A fifth of UK waste now passes through criminal hands,” says Taylor. “I’m sure the Environment Agency are doing everything they can with the resources they have, but there are only five full-time officers checking all the waste coming out of England’s ports.” Approximately 9m waste containers pass through UK ports every year, but only 0.02% are being inspected. “So when that waste arrives in Istanbul and isn’t what it’s supposed to be, it’s passed on to more and more dodgy smaller businesses,” says Taylor. “And they don’t have to do what they should do with it because no one’s checking.”View image in fullscreenIn the factory, Hayat speaks to his family in Afghanistan.Photograph: Adnan Khan/Via Afghan refugeesSince China banned plastic waste imports in 2018, Turkey has become a top destination for exports of plastic, with more illegal factories popping up to meet demand. There have already been reports that this plastic ends up being burned instead of recycled.Boy Wasted unearths a sinister picture of the human cost. It looks into cover-ups, payoffs and bribes, as well as a widespread indifference to the deaths of refugees, who, Khan says, are treated as “subhuman” and like animals. “Everybody is aware and it’s totally in the open,” he adds. “One boss literally said to me at a recycling facility: ‘My business wouldn’t survive without these people. We need the cheap labour for this industry to survive.’” Some of the undocumented workers work 14- to 16-hour days and live in storage cupboards inside the factories, with no access to running water or toilets.The industry is so reliant on exploiting this workforce that companies budget for compensation money to be paid to their families in the event of their deaths. In the podcast, Aslı Odman of İSİG Meclisi refers to this as “blood money”.“It’s accounted for in businesses,” says Ashby. “The idea that you don’t pay insurance or you don’t get safe equipment because it’s cheaper just to lose lives … that is such gross negligence and awful callousness towards human life that I can’t even think of a word for it.” Odman does find the word for it, though. “I think we have the right to call it murder,” she says in the series.‘Plastic recycling is a myth’: what really happens to your rubbish?Read moreThe podcast is an arresting and horrific insight into the link between consumption, waste and the loss of human life. It’s also a story that Ashby feels is especially timely. “With the great dehumanising of refugees in Europe and Britain that is going on, we’ve set out to humanise these people and to inhabit their world every single part of the way,” he says. “I hope even if listeners don’t care about plastic and the environment, it might be interesting from that perspective.”Aside from conveying empathy during a time of widespread cruelty, there’s also a searing environmental message burned into the show. “By sending so much dodgy waste out into the world, we are creating this system,” says Ashby. “We enable the deaths of refugees. Not just Britain – there’s other countries as well – but Britain is one of the biggest exporters to Turkey. They call it ‘waste colonialism’, and no longer can we just send out our toxicities to the rest of the world.“We cannot continue with creating this enormous tide of plastic. This is a scandal hiding in plain sight and we cannot turn a blind eye.”Boy Wasted is available via ENDS Report’s Eco Chamber podcast, wherever you get your podcasts.Explore more on these topicsPodcastsWasteRecyclingTurkeyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Ride bikes. Wild camp.” I’m in Perthshire on a three-day bikepacking trip – cycling with all my gear – and this is my itinerary for the day. For an endlessly calendar-checking parent of three, the simplicity of this schedule is almost dizzying. I feel like a child with my summer holiday stretching out ahead of me.Comrie Croft Journeysis a new initiative from eco-camping and mountain-biking destinationComrie Croft, started by experienced mountain bike instructor Emily Greaves. The off-grid cycling adventures aim to immerse visitors in Scotland’s wild landscapes while providing everything they need, from food to equipment. Guests can choose to be self-guided or led – and I’m heading out with Emily to explore on a mountain bike for the first time in my adult life.Scotland biking mapThe croft is set across quiet woodland and bucolic meadows and I arrive early to explore the onsite organic market gardenTomnah’aand enjoy a hearty mixed grain bowl with roast root vegetables and local Wee Comrie cheese atGorse cafe. I’ve driven here, but for the ultimate emission-avoiding trip, it’s possible to get the train to Gleneagles from Edinburgh or London, then be picked up in the Croft’s electric car.Before we hit the trails, Emily puts me through my paces with a mountain-biking lesson on the gravel pump track. We’re cycling for three days and everything we need – clothes, food, camping stove, tent, sleeping bags and mat – has to be strapped to our bikes. Beside me a French family is getting set up for a self-guided adventure. Emily has planned their route, pre-loaded on a GPX device with detailed trip notes, and prepped their bikes and equipment. I thought I’d packed light, but most of my clothes are soon in a discard pile. “You need clothes to cycle in, warm layers to sleep in, and waterproofs – that’s it,” Emily says.View image in fullscreenAilsa, right, with her guide Emily.Photograph: Ailsa SheldonFully laden we head off, uphill through ancient woodland and the pretty village of Comrie, then on to rough farm tracks heading into the hills. Tonight’s destination is a youth hostel, a last-minute change due to thundery weather. Bikepacking doesn’t always have to mean camping – many long-distance cyclists combine camping with stays at hostels and even hotels. It’s about enjoyment, not endurance, or “smiles not miles”, as Emily puts it.Today’s ride is 20 miles (32km), taking in 520 metres of ascent. It’s an intentionally gentle start, but for me still pretty challenging, as I get to grips with my cycling position, descending on loose gravel, and learning to trust the bike. We pass through fields of sheep, splash through little streams, slowly gaining height over the lower slopes of Carn Labhruinn and Meall Odhar. By the time we descend towards Callander, the clouds darken, obscuring the mountain tops, and heavy rain soaks in the seams of my jacket: I’m delighted not to be putting up a tent. AtCallander Hostel, run by a local social enterprise, we stay in a cosy pod in the garden (from £81), dry our soggy clothes, and sleep deeply.I’m getting to love the calf-burning push of a long uphill and the thrill of the downhill tooDay two is our longest in the saddle, with 44 miles to cover. Emily, sensibly, doesn’t tell me the ascent until later (it’s 1,020 metres). We set out in high spirits, fuelled by egg and haggis rolls fromMhor Breadin Callander.We’re riding through Loch Lomond and the Trossachs national park, an area I’ve often driven through but never stopped to fully appreciate – I’ve been missing out. With mountains aplenty, peaceful lochs and glens, and a well-connected network of paths and trails, there’s so much to explore. Emily’s well-designed route takes us along some quiet single-track roads, but is mostly off-road, on gravel tracks through heathery glens, forestry plantations and native woodland, and on winding lochside paths through the bracken.View image in fullscreenThe routes take in glorious open countryside.Photograph: Pete ScullionWe pedal along the quiet side of Loch Venachar before joining the Three Lochs Forest Drive, a rough track that links Loch Drunkie, Lochan Reòidhte, and Loch Achray. It’s hilly, but I’m getting to love the calf-burning push of a long uphill, and the thrill of the downhill too. At Aberfoyle, we stop atLiz MacGregors coffee shopfor lemon drizzle cake. “You have to keep your energy up,” Emily says. She has completed many long-distance cycles, including the epicHighland Trail 550, often named one of Scotland’s toughest off-road cycling races. If she says it’s time to eat cake, I’m only too happy to agree.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe TravellerFree newsletterGet travel inspiration, featured trips and local tips for your next break, as well as the latest deals from Guardian HolidaysEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It’s tempting, but given steamships have been running on Loch Katrine for over 180 years, it seems safe to leave it for another day. Today is all about the bikes, and I don’t want to miss a moment. Later we pitch tents by the shores of Loch Achray, with just a slight dance with the midges until the breeze returns. We collect water, heat up instant meals on our camp stoves, and drink in the views of Ben A’an and Ben Venue.View image in fullscreenLuxury accommodation and the Nowhere Sauna await at the end of the ride.Photograph: Seth TinsleyIn the morning, the loch shimmers silver in the pale sunlight and Emily and I wade in for a beautifully refreshing swim, then warm up with bowls of porridge. The last day of cycling has come round all too soon, and it’s 37 miles back to Comrie, with a lunch stop atMhor 84in Balquhidder. The last stretch takes in Glen Finglas estate singletrack, a popular local cycling route along an undulating ridge. I’m loving feeling the power in my legs.Back at Comrie Croft we’ve reserved seats atNowhere Sauna(from £16), one of the 12 micro-businesses that operate at the croft. Tucked into a quiet corner of woodland, it’s the perfect place to stretch and relax, interspersed with refreshing dunks in the icy tin bath. From here, it’s a short walk uphill for a decidedly more luxurious evening, at the croft’s newly openedcabin. Joining the site’scamping pitches,Nordic katas(conical, tipi-like tents) and itseco-lodge hostel, the handbuilt wooden cabin is a beautiful hideaway for two adults (plus a child or two on a convertible sofa, if you must). With a wood-burning stove, full kitchen, mezzanine bedroom and big private deck, it’s likely to be popular with onsite weddings and honeymooners. Tonight it’s all mine, and even better, local deliHansen’s Kitchenhas dropped me off supper, including local beers and a lasagne made with vegetables from the market garden. I sit out on the deck until the first stars appear, resting my tired legs and soaking in the scenery, reflecting on an incredible few days.The cycling trip and accommodation were provided byComrie CroftandComrie Croft Journeys.

Are any actually worth saving?With many classic puddings on the verge of dying out, I set out to discover which should be back on the menu. It was a journey through some of the heaviest desserts in historyTim DowlingTue 23 Sep 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 23 Sep 2025 11.10 EDTShareBritain’s puddings are under threat. According toresearch from English Heritage, only 2% of British households eat a daily homemade dessert, while a third never bake, boil or steam one at all.“Sweet puddings are closely intertwined with British history and it would be a huge shame for them to die out,” said the charity’s senior curator of history, Dr Andrew Hann. But he went on to suggest that, at the current rate of decline, the British pudding will be extinct in 50 years.View image in fullscreenNo history, no nostalgia … American Tim Dowling prepares to steam a sponge.Photograph: Alicia Canter/The GuardianLeaving aside complex questions about what does and doesn’t constitute a British pudding – we know an apple crumble is one, and a Calippo isn’t – we must ask ourselves why we’ve stopped producing old-fashioned cooked desserts. Do we lack the time, or the skill – or both? Have tastes changed? Have certain classic puddings simply faded from Britain’s collective memory?I can’t answer that last one – I’m American. I’ve been exposed to many British puddings over the years, but I have no history with them, or nostalgia for them. To remedy this, I tried cooking 10 of Britain’s endangered puddings, in an attempt to find out which, if any, are worthy of a rescue effort, and which may deserve their approaching extinction.Jam roly-polyView image in fullscreenTim’s slightly raw jam roly-poly.Photograph: Tim Dowling/The GuardianI’ve never eaten a jam roly-poly, AKA shirt-sleeve pudding, AKA dead man’s arm. My adult British children reckon they have had it for school dinners, but they were as surprised as I was by the recipe, especially the generous amount of beef suet. Suet, the fat around the kidneys of the animal, is commonly available in a fairly inoffensive, pelleted form. There is a vegetable version, but I stuck with the original.I watched chef Aaron Middleton’s video tutorial, because I figured there would be some technique to master, but the dough itself is basic: self-raising flour, butter, suet, sugar, milk. Once it comes together, you flatten it into a large rectangle, slather the whole thing in raspberry jam, roll it up and pinch the ends.View image in fullscreenShredded beef suet.Photograph: Alicia Canter/The GuardianThis assembly is then wrapped in a parcel of greaseproof paper and foil, and steamed in the oven, with a roasting tin full of boiling water sitting on the rack below.The most generous thing I could say about my first jam roly-poly is that it let me down: it didn’t rise; it didn’t form a crust; it didn’t, to be honest, come out of the oven looking materially different from when I put it in. If I were being less generous, I would also add that it was disgusting – claggy, sickly sweet and still raw in places. Something went wrong, and I’m not sure what. I forced a slice on my middle son and dared him to be complimentary.“You can really taste the suet,” he said.Rating (1 being the least palatable/hardest to make, and 5 the nicest/easiest): taste: 1; ease: 1Sussex pond puddingView image in fullscreenInferior to an actual apple … Tim’s Sussex pond pudding.Photograph: Alicia Canter/The GuardianI followed Mary Berry’s recipe for this timeless British pudding that I’ve never heard of; you have to wonder if the name isn’t a big part of the problem. Sussex pond pudding is made with apples, muscovado sugar and, yes, more suet. It also has a whole lemon at its heart, which I guess you’re supposed to cut around when you serve it. But we’re getting ahead of ourselves.It employs a similar dough to the one for the jam roly-poly that failed me so badly, though perhaps this one is a little drier. The apples are peeled, cored, diced into cubes and mixed with cold butter and sugar. You also need a pudding basin of about 1.5 litres capacity, or around 20cm diameter across the top.The basin is thoroughly buttered, the dough rolled out into a 30cm circle. Slice out one quarter of it – from noon to 3pm, say – and reserve. The remainder should fit snugly into the contours of your pudding bowl. Spoon a bit of the apple, butter and sugar mixture into the bottom of the pastry lining. Pierce the lemon all over with a fork or cocktail stick and sit it upright in the mixture. Surround that with more apples, and then turn your reserved dough into a circular lid.View image in fullscreenA dog’s dinner? Tim and his pudding.Photograph: Alicia Canter/The GuardianI had to watch a video of a guy sealing and tying his pudding bowl for steaming several times – it’s complicated – but you fashion a covering from a layer of greaseproof paper and one of foil, with a pleat down the middle for expansion. Then, you tie string tightly round the edge (pudding basins have a pronounced lip for this purpose), create a handle from more string, and trim off the excess foil. The resulting parcel is pretty impressive – if only one was allowed to stop there.This package goes into a big pan with a tight-fitting lid, with boiling water poured halfway up the sides of the bowl. Simmer with the lid on for – get this –three-and-a-half hours, topping up the water as needed.As soon as it’s cool enough, invert over a plate; you should end up with a crusty dome surrounding an apple pie filling. And a lemon.I used to think I understood what the word stodgy meant in a culinary context, but the Sussex pond pudding has reset my frame of reference. This is, by some measure, the heaviest dessert I’ve ever made, and while it’s not terrible, I can’t think of anything to recommend it over a hundred other apple-based foodstuffs, including an apple.Taste: 2; ease: 2Bread and butter puddingView image in fullscreenTim’s bread and butter pudding.Photograph: Tim Dowling/The GuardianBesides suet, the other big ingredient you’ll find in endangered British puddings is old bread – the older the better. Many pudding recipes even offer tips for ageing bread which is insufficiently past it.I’ve tasted – and, with certain reservations, enjoyed – bread and butter pudding in the past, but I’ve never made my own. I hadn’t quite realised the extent to which it is simply breakfast in another form – toast, butter, eggs, milk – with a few sultanas scattered over the top. As classic puddings go, it’s refreshingly foolproof – just layer everything into a deep dish, like a lasagne, and bake until set. My family ate this without complaint and, although I’ve always found it disconcerting that actual slices of bread are left sticking up out of it – like the sardine heads poking out of a stargazy pie – I would hate to see it become extinct for that reason.Taste: 3; ease: 3Queen of puddingsView image in fullscreenTim holds his queen of puddings.Photograph: Alicia Canter/The GuardianTo be on the safe side, I chose a recipe by the queen of puddings herself, Delia Smith. This is another old bread dessert, requiring fresh (ie stale) white breadcrumbs soaked in hot milk, combined with sugar, egg yolks, butter and lemon zest. The result is baked in an ovenproof dish until it takes on a weird rubbery texture. Then you spread melted jam over the top, layer stiff egg whites on top of the jam, and bake for another 10 to 15 minutes until the meringue peaks are nicely singed.This was a wholly surprising success – elegant and even a little decadent, although I only had a taste before my wife took the whole thing to a dinner party I wasn’t invited to, and came back with an empty dish. In the circumstances, full marks.Taste: 5; ease: 4Treacle sponge puddingView image in fullscreenShabby stuff … Tim’s treacle sponge pudding.Photograph: Tim Dowling/The GuardianI’m relieved to discover that this contains neither suet or old bread. According to Delia, it’s a sponge batter with a bit of black treacle in the mix, poured into a pudding basin that already has a generous puddle of golden syrup in the bottom, and steamed for two hours. When it’s turned out, the syrup should run down through it in the time-honoured fashion.My first ever attempt was a little shabby in appearance – some of the sponge clung to the bowl, and I missed the middle of the plate when turning it out – but it was absolutely delicious when accompanied by custard, double cream, clotted cream or, in my case, an unholy combination of the three.Taste: 5; ease: 4FlummeryView image in fullscreenTim adds whipped cream to his flummery.Photograph: Alicia Canter/The GuardianAn ancient, jelly-like dessert, flummery is traditionally thickened with the starch that comes from oatmeal soaked in water. This presents two problems from the modern cook’s perspective: first, a full 48 hours of soaking is required before the oatmeal is discarded and the starchy water preserved; and second, even that will not be enough.“So the flummery refuses to thicken,” is a phrase that could easily come from a 17th-century book of aphorisms. But that’s what happened to me. I stirred the mixture of cloudy oat water, orange juice and sugar for nearly half an hour, and still it doth refuse.View image in fullscreenTim and his son give his flummery a whirl.Photograph: Alicia Canter/The GuardianThe recipe I consulted says that if your flummery is reluctant to thicken you can add a bit of cornflour, which is another way of saying “warning: this recipe may not work”. A bit of cornflour, I decided, equates to about half a teaspoon. When that achieved nothing, I added another half teaspoon, and another, and another. By that point I was thinking: even if this works, it’s no longer a true flummery.Suddenly, almost an hour after I started stirring, the mixture turned to glue. I beat in some cream and put it in the fridge, as instructed, to set even further. The recipe is meant to yield six dessert glasses of flummery. My version stretched to exactly one.However, once I’d added a thin layer of honey mixed with whisky, and a thick layer of piped whipped cream dusted with orange zest, the dessert started looking the part. It even tasted good, although of the three layers, the bottom one – the flummery itself – was my least favourite.Taste: 3; ease: 1SpotteddickView image in fullscreenDull and dry … Tim’s spotted dick in progress.Photograph: Alicia Canter/The GuardianThis is the last of the suet puddings on the list, and ideally the last one I will ever make. I am getting very good at trussing up puddings for steaming, but progressively less good at eating them – I’m beginning to lose heart.This is essentially the same old basic suet dough, this time studded with currants, a sort of miser’s raisin. Curiously, James Martin’s recipe leaves out the protective foil layer for steaming – he uses greaseproof paper with a tea towel over the top instead. It sounds risky, but I follow his instructions because I’m not in a position to know if it makes a difference.The result, however, looks perfect, and tastes exactly as I guessed it would: dry and dull. It’s much better with custard, but not as good as custard on its own.Taste: 2; ease: 4Malvern puddingView image in fullscreenTim’s Malvern pudding.Photograph: Tim Dowling/The GuardianThis one is simple – apples in custard, with a demerara sugar and cinnamon crust on top, like a Worcestershire creme brulee. The Hairy Bikers’ recipe relies on what is essentially a creme patissiere; but if you can nail that part the rest is easy, as well as tasty. It’s also the only one of the 10 puddings here that you could conceivably produce on a whim. Malvern pudding came eighth in a list of the10 most threatened British puddingsback in 2006 (calf’s foot jelly came top), but on this showing it deserves reassessment.Taste: 5; ease: 4Cabinet puddingView image in fullscreenBegging for cream … Tim’s cabinet pudding.Photograph: Alicia Canter/The GuardianThe historical version of cabinet pudding – or chancellor’s pudding – seems to be another old bread recipe, but the version I made is a fairly ordinary kind of sponge. The gimmicks are the mixed peel added to the dough and the halved glace cherries decorating the sides. You must add the dough a bit at a time, to support each fresh row of cherries along the wall of the basin, otherwise they’ll slip off. It needs to steam for an hour and a half, which in the world of traditional British puddings is a blink of an eye.I like this one – it looks very impressive, for comparatively little effort, and, like almost all these puddings, it begs to be drowned in custard or cream or both. If you were the chancellor you may feel you deserved more, but I was happy enough.Taste: 3; ease: 4Rice puddingView image in fullscreenTim’s rice pudding.Photograph: Tim Dowling/The GuardianA confession: I have a longstanding aversion to rice pudding. I can’t call it dislike, because I’ve never actually let any pass my lips. But it doesn’t rise to the level of a phobia either; just a lifetime of saying, “None for me, thanks.”I trust the food writer Simon Hopkinson in all things, but I’m taking his word for it in this case, since I don’t know what rice pudding is supposed to taste like. He starts his rice pudding on the hob: melting butter, coating the pudding rice (not that easy to come by, but it’s basically paella rice), and stirring in sugar until the rice is swollen and sticky. Add milk – a whole litre – some cream, vanilla and a grating of nutmeg over the top. Bake for between an hour and 90 minutes, depending.I’m assured by my wife, who likes rice pudding, that this is a very good version. Having tried it for the first time, I can return to my aversion with confidence. At this point, I quite fancy a Calippo.Taste: 3.5; ease: 5View image in fullscreenNo tears shed … collateral from the spotted dick.Photograph: Alicia Canter/The GuardianOf all the puddings tested, I would say that Malvern pudding is most worthy of rehabilitation, and simultaneously the most in need of it. And while I would shed no tears if either spotted dick or Sussex pond pudding became extinct tomorrow, jam roly-poly is one pudding I’d be happy to terminate with extreme prejudice.Which puddings would you keep, and which would you bin?
