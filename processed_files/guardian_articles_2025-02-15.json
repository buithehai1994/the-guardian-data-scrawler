UK sources said they believed those invited to Paris by Macron would be the Nato secretary general, Mark Rutte, and the leaders of Germany, Italy, the UK and Poland.Starmer said: “This is a once-in-a-generation moment for our national security where we engage with the reality of the world today and the threat we face from Russia. It’s clear Europe must take a greater role in Nato as we work with the United States to secure Ukraine’s future and face down the threat we face from Russia. The UK will work to ensure we keep the US and Europe together. We cannot allow any divisions in the alliance to distract from the external enemies we face.”Macron’s speed in trying to unite European leaders behind a joint response shows the extent of anxiety in Europe about US efforts both to control the process and exclude European governments from any detailed negotiations between the US and Russia.1:53Zelenskyy says time has come to create an 'armed forces of Europe' – videoThe prospect of Starmer’s involvement also highlights how the UK prime minister is becoming drawn into a European response, despite the UK having left the EU. With European leaders expected to convene in Paris, it is anticipated that Russian and US officials will meet in Saudi Arabia this week to map out what they intend to be the peace process.The Europeans’ anxieties intensified on Saturday when Trump’s special envoy for Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, said it was not realistic for Europe’s leaders to be involved. “It may be like chalk on the blackboard, it may grate a little bit, but I am telling you something that is really quite honest,” said Kellogg at the Munich conference.“And to my European friends, I would say: ‘Get into the debate, not by complaining that you might, yes or no, be at the table, but by coming up with concrete proposals, ideas, ramp up [defence] spending.’”Kellogg said he was working on “Trump time”, and an agreement was expected in weeks and months.The US is also reported to have sent a letter to European states, asking what troops they are willing to supply to a peacekeeping force.One European diplomat said that “it appears Europe is going to be asked to police a deal that it had no direct hand in negotiating. In the meantime, Donald Trump is seeking to take 50% control of Ukraine’s rare minerals”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He said: “We need a guarantee that, if the agreement is violated, we can act, and this is a sufficient threat for the Russian Federation not to violate this guarantee.”He also urged the US not to disengage from Ukraine, saying the best security guarantee for the country against future Russian aggression was binding US industry, business and defence capability into its future. “That is what will make Putin sit up and pay attention, and that is what’s attractive to a US president who knows how to get a good deal.”Kellogg said one reason previous peace talks had failed was because too many countries were involved. “We are not going to get down that path,” he said on the margins of the Munich security conference.Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, had earlier used his speech to the conference to warn that Europe was likely to be excluded from the negotiations. He urged Europe to step up and form a European army in which Ukraine would play a central role.Zelenskyy told Europe to avoid being abandoned at the negotiation table by Trump. “Let’s be honest – now we can’t rule out that America might say no to Europe on issues that threaten it. Many leaders have talked about a Europe that needs its own military – an army of Europe. I believe the time has come. The armed forces of Europe must be created.“A few days ago, President Trump told me about his conversation with Putin. Not once did he mention that America needs Europe at that table. That says a lot. The old days are over – when America supported Europe just because it always had.“Ukraine will never accept deals made behind our backs without our involvement. And the same rule should apply to all of Europe. No decisions about Ukraine without Ukraine. No decisions about Europe without Europe.”With many European nations facing increasingly Eurosceptic electorates, his ideas about integration are unlikely to take off, but his remarks may galvanise the continent into more detailed discussions about what military role it can play in Ukraine, including by putting troops on the ground to protect a ceasefire.European leaders went into Saturday’s session of the Munich conference already reeling from theconfrontational speechon Friday by the US vice-president, JD Vance, in which he scolded them for ignoring popular concerns over immigration and accused them of suppressing free speech.The EU’s foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, characterised Vance as “trying to pick a fight” with Europe, home to some of the US’s closest allies.The Polish prime minister, Donald Tusk, responded on social media, saying: “Europe urgently needs its own plan of action concerning Ukraine and our security, or else other global players will decide about our future. Not necessarily in line with our own interest … This plan must be prepared now. There’s no time to lose.”Explore more on these topicsUkraineThe ObserverEuropeUS foreign policyRussianewsShareReuse this content"

Others have been concerned about the level of support for her from colleagues during the exchanges.While most MPs are sympathetic to Badenoch, who isless than four months into the job, some MPs and frontbenchers want to see her bolster her advisory team with Tory figures seasoned in the difficult task of landing political blows.One former cabinet minister said there had been complaints among MPs that Badenoch kept avoiding obvious attacks on Starmer’s handling of the economy, instead opting for “Westminster village-orientated” topics that she persevered with for too long. “People are putting on a brave face at the moment, but the comment I’ve heard more often than any other is that she keeps picking the wrong subjects,” they said. “There are some big things going on that could really resonate – like the economy.”An MP who shared the concerns said: “We have people who have been involved in PMQs prep for a long time and I hope she’s got some continuity there, because it’s important we get it right. It doesn’t necessarily mean she’ll be perfect, but she needs experience behind her. You need wise heads who know what they’re doing.”The discontent surfaced after this week’s outing, in whichBadenoch confronted Starmerover an attempt by a family from Gaza to use a Ukrainian resettlement scheme to come to the UK, as well as the appointment of a new borders inspector who lives in Finland.However, Starmer responded by stating that the government was already reviewing the findings of the case of the Gazan family, while the borders inspector had been appointed by the last government – and had now been instructed to work from the UK.Sympathetic Tory MPs said that the complaints over Badenoch’s approach were simply evidence of how hard it was to make an impression as opposition leader and pleaded for colleagues to give her time. “No one’s going to be a rock star immediately,” said one frontbencher. “It’s going to be incredibly difficult and she’s got to grow into the job. If it does seem clunky, she’s got four years to get this right. Having said that, Starmer is unbelievably crap.”Close allies of Badenoch reject the criticisms of her approach to PMQs. They argue that with Labour enjoying a “super majority” in the Commons, she is showing she is serious about holding the government to account. They also say that her attacks on Starmer for not being on top of what his government is doing will expose the prime minister.“Whatever the commentariat’s view, Kemi is holding Starmer to account,” one said. “This week, he misled the House of Commons [overthe Gaza family’s case]. He said this court case was heard under the last government. It was not. He also refused to say whether this government would appeal the verdict. There have been previous examples. Her job is to be an effective opposition and that is what she is determined to do every week. She’s not going to be sidetracked or worried about what people are saying.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

MPs said any discussion about replacing another leader would make them look absurd and must be avoided. Many Tories believe thatRobert Jenrick, the shadow justice secretary who Badenoch defeated to become leader, continues to have leadership ambitions and is waiting in the wings.“We’ve got the leader we’ve got,” said an MP. “People saying she’s got until after the local elections to prove herself are nuts. We cannot possibly change our leader again.”Explore more on these topicsKemi BadenochThe ObserverPMQsConservativesKeir StarmerRobert JenricknewsShareReuse this content"

The administration rescinded the order two days later and is re-evaluating it.Across the federal government, about 280,000 employees out of the 2.3 million-member civilian federal workforce were hired in the last two years, with most still on probation and easier to fire, according to government data.In addition to the visits to national parks, about 159 million people visit national forests annually. The Department of Agriculture, which oversees the Forest Service, said it could not comment on personnel matters.The agriculture department said in a statement that protecting people and communities, as well as infrastructure, businesses and resources, remains “a top priority”.“Our wildland firefighter and other public safety positions are of the utmost priority,” it added.However, the federal funding freeze is affecting programs meant to mitigate wildfire risk in western states as well as freezing the hiring of seasonal firefighters.The reduction in resources for wildfire prevention comes a month after devastating blazes in Los Angeles that are expected to be the costliest in US history.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It has already phased out eyestalk ablation in its supply chain.“Animal welfareis a top priority for Waitrose, and since 2023 we’ve been working with our suppliers to push our industry-leading standards even higher by trialling electrical prawn stunning,” said a spokesperson.“We’ve committed to rolling this out to our entire supply chain by the end of next year, and this applies to all our farmed shrimp and prawns.”It is thought that more than 440 billion prawns and shrimp are farmed each year, along with billions caught wild. The UK imports shrimp and prawns worth about£570m a year.The global supply chain of farmed shrimp is booming as consumers opt for healthier options, but welfare concerns are now being raised. Eyestalk ablation involves the removal, typically by a blade and then crushing, of one or both of a mother prawn’s eyes to stimulate egg production.View image in fullscreen‘There is growing recognition of the sentience of these animals’: Justine Audemard from the International Council for Animal Welfare.Photograph: Mykola Davydenko/AlamyWhen slaughtered, prawns are supposed to die from thermal shock in a mixture of ice and water, but campaigners say the method is often ineffective and prawns can have a prolonged death from asphyxiation.Legislation passed in the UK in 2022provided legal recognition that decapod crustaceans, including crabs, lobster, prawns and shrimp, are sentient animals with the capacity to experience pain, distress and harm.The International Council for Animal Welfare (ICAW) said it wants all retailers to commit to humane slaughter and end ablation. To date, according to ICAW, Tesco, Marks & Spencer, Sainsbury’s, Ocado and nowWaitrosehave ended the practice, or committed to end it, and are implementing electric stunning for farmed prawns. It has urged other supermarkets, including Co-op, Morrisons, Iceland and Asda, to follow suit.The group, which had been in talks with Waitrose on welfare issues, said shrimp have been “treated as if they were vegetables”.Justine Audemard, head of negotiations at ICAW, said: “Electric stunning has been recognised as the most humane method and will significantly reduce the suffering of prawns during slaughter. It’s easy to implement for retailers.“There is growing recognition of the sentience of these animals, by the UK government and other governments in Europe. We know that when people are educated about what they go through, they are willing to pay a little more for a product that is respectful of animal welfare.”Research has shownthat comparable levels of egg productivity can be reached without eyestalk ablation.The global shrimp market, which includes prawns and shrimp, is worth more than £30bn a year and has been boosted by increased demand for low-fat, protein-rich foods. The biggest exporters of prawns to the UK are Vietnam, India and Ecuador.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Smaller shrimp in standard supermarket sandwiches are typically cold-water prawns, while most king prawns on supermarket shelves or in takeaway meals will be farmed.The Shrimp Welfare Project, a UK charity, works with the industry to support sustainable farming and improved welfare. It provides electrical stunners to producers at minimal or no cost, ensuring animals experience minimal pain during slaughter.Krzysztof Wojtas, chief programmes officer at the project, said: “We have welfare policies for other farmed species, so why not for shrimp? We know they have anatomical structures to feel pain and react when pain is imposed on them.”The London School of Economics and Political Sciencepublished a review in November 2021that recommended all cephalopod molluscs, including octopus and squid, and decapod crustaceans, including crabs, lobsters and shrimp, be regarded as sentient animals.Evidence on the sentience of shrimp is significant but limited, however, and experts say more research is now required. The Animal Welfare (Sentience) Act 2022 provided legal recognition that these animals had the capacity to experience pain, distress or harm.Scampi scam?

The Swiss government introduced a law in 2018 thatrequired lobsters to be knocked out before boiling.A Co-op spokesperson said: “Animal welfare is very important to us, and all our fresh and frozen prawns are ablation-free. We continue to actively work with our suppliers to ultimately abolish eyestalk ablation in our supply chain.”It is understood the supermarket is also exploring use of electric stunning on supplier prawn farms.

They don’t have any open injury. Most [likely died from] hypoxia or maybe some blunt injury but that would only be confirmed after an autopsy.“There are also 11 others who are injured. Most of them are stable and have orthopaedic injuries.”Narendra Modi, the Indian prime minister, said on X: “My thoughts are with all those who have lost their loved ones. I pray that the injured have a speedy recovery. The authorities are assisting all those who have been affected by this stampede.”Authorities ordered an inquiry into the incident and said the situation was now under control.The defence minister, Rajnath Singh, said he was “extremely pained by the loss of lives due to stampede” at the New Delhi railway station.“In this hour of grief, my thoughts are with the bereaved families. Praying for the speedy [recovery] of the injured,” Singh said in a social media post.The governor of the capital, Vinai Kumar Saxena, said disaster management personnel had been told to deploy and “all hospitals are in readiness to address related exigencies”.The railways minister, Ashwini Vaishnaw, said additional special trains were being run from New Delhi to clear the rush of devotees.The six-weekKumbh Melais the single biggest milestone in the Hindu religious calendar, and officials said about 500 million devotees have already visited the festival since it began last month.More than 400 people died after they were trampled or drowned on a single day of the festival in 1954, one of the largest tolls in a crowd-related disaster globally.Another 36 people were crushed to death in 2013, the last time the festival was staged in Prayagraj.Explore more on these topicsIndiaKumbh MelaHinduismReligionSouth and central AsianewsShareReuse this content"

He is a Syrian national with legal residence in Austria, they said.The victims were all men. Two were seriously injured, according to police.A police spokesperson, Rainer Dionisio, said a motive was not immediately known. He added that police were investigating the attacker’s personal background. “We have to wait until we get secure information,” he said.A 42-year-old man who works for a food delivery company, and who is also from Syria, witnessed the incident from his car, police said. He drove toward the suspect and helped to prevent things from getting worse, Dionisio told Austria’s public broadcaster, ORF.Peter Kaiser, the governor of the Austrian province of Carinthia, expressed his condolences to the family of the 14-year-old victim.“This outrageous atrocity must be met with harsh consequences. I have always said with clarity and unambiguously: those who live in Carinthia, in Austria, have to respect the law and adjust to our rules and values.”Erwin Angerer, a lawmaker for the far-right Freedom party, said his party had been warning about the situation in Austria as a result of the country’s “disastrous asylum policy”.Austria’s interior minister, Gerhard Karner, was expected in Villach on Sunday morning.Police said it wasn’t clear whether the suspect acted on his own and continued to search for potential additional suspects.Several European countries, among them Austria, said in December they are suspending decisions on asylum claims by Syrian nationals because of the unclear political situation in their homeland following the fall of Bashar al-Assad.Agence France-Presse contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsAustriaEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

The suspect was a man who knew the victim, police said.The suspect may have entered the water at the Dartford Crossing, police said, after call handlers received reports of a man on the wrong side of the barrier.The senior investigating officer, DCI David Higham, said they are “not ruling out the possibility that he may have entered the water”, and that the force is “currently only looking for one suspect and do not believe there to be an ongoing risk to the public”.Map of area where murder occurredOfficers were called to the pub near Sevenoaks just after 7pm on Friday. The force said in a statement: “Officers attended the scene along with South East Coast ambulance service where a woman in her 40s had suffered injuries consistent with gunshot wounds.“She was declared deceased at the scene and a murder investigation is under way. Her next of kin has been informed.“As part of inquiries, officers attended the Dartford Crossing where a vehicle linked to the incident was recovered, alongside a firearm. Inquiries are ongoing to identify and locate all persons potentially involved.”Ray Picot, a local parish councillor, told Kent Online he had heard “a couple of loud bangs” at 7pm. “It’s a shock. We’ve never had anything like this,” he said. “It’s a very busy pub, a great pub. It never has any trouble and is very well-managed.“I understand those inside the pub were ushered back to their houses by police as they were all in terrible shock. It sounded awful.”Fellow parish councillor Steve Maines told the BBC: “We were sitting having our Valentine’s Day meal when all of a sudden we heard this huge commotion outside in the car park. We were told someone had been shot so we had to leave.”Dorothy Wong, who lives in the village, said: “I heard around three to four bangs outside and loud shouting from a woman’s voice.”It is understood neither the suspect or victim were from Kent but had local connections to the area.PA Media contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsKentEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

For Carras, who founded the heritage society 50 years ago with her late Anglo-Greek shipowner husband, Costas, it’s a battle redolent of older struggles. More than four decades after the “neighbourhood of the gods” survived being overrun by nightclubs and terrace bars, its discovery by developers, avaricious investors and global real estate firms, is again posing an existential threat. On the back of the tourist boom, entire buildings had fallen prey to the short-term rental industry and Airbnb. The few shops that have held out are, like residents, on the brink of extinction.“Plaka is meant to be protected as it’s so unique,” says Carras. “Thanks to special zoning laws enshrined in presidential decrees it was saved all those years ago. The reality now is that residents are leaving and not only because laws are being violated; the crowds, the noise, the chaos have made their lives unbearable.”Visitors, she said, did not want to experience “lifeless stage sets” but inhabited areas that felt authentic and real. “This is a small neighbourhood. It was built for residents, not what we’re seeing today.”View image in fullscreenRestaurateurs enjoy a brief respite from the crowds in the Plaka district of central Athens.Photograph: Louisa Gouliamaki/AFP/Getty ImagesIn his cavernous city hall office Doukas does not disguise his consternation. The projections of tourist arrivals are nothing short of pleasing – further proof that Athens is no longer a pit stop for travellers en route to the islands. But at record highs the forecasts are also replete with risk.This year, 10 million visitors, two million more than in 2024, are predicted to descend on the capital, many for city breaks that have made it so popular. If only a fraction head towards Plaka, there will be “intolerable pressure” on its labyrinthine network of alleys and streets.“Of the 35 million tourists Greece is set to receive, 10 million, nearly equal to Greece’s entire population, will visit Athens,” he says. “For the first time we’ll be Greece’s top destination, but it’s unsustainable. Plaka, in particular, is oversaturated. It can’t go on.”A recent “carrying capacity” study commissioned by the municipality and drafted by the university of Piraeus, urged authorities to take immediate action if Athens wanted to avoid becoming a victim of its own success.“There’s not a day to lose. We have to act if we don’t want to become the next Barcelona, which is why the task force, with the support of the municipal police, will have every service at its disposal,” explained Doukas, a professor of energy policy before the centre-left Pasok party fielded him for the post.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It’s already happened several times with short-term rentals.”Few neighbourhoods inEuropehave been lived in as continuously as Plaka. Nestled on the northern and eastern slopes of the Acropolis, its mansions and two-storey buildings, wrapped around the Agora and other archaeological sites, it is an area that has been inhabited since neolithic times. For Greeks the quarter is not just a window on the classical world but an unbreakable link with antiquity.“When inhabitants leave, places die,” says Giorgos Zafeiriou, an architect who heads Plaka’s residents association. “We’ve seen it time and again.”The situation had become “desperate” for the district’s diminishing community, long forced into a fragile coexistence with the owners of cafes, restaurants and bars. In summer the influx put extraordinary pressure on Plaka’s antiquated infrastructure, he said, especially its sewage system. Worries about overtourism were such that residents joined the network of Mediterranean Historical Cities to exchange experiences on how to deal with the issues.“What we’re seeing,” says Zafeiriou, “is a fight for the soul of Plaka. But there’s cause for optimism, too.”One ray of hope is an upcoming, potentially landmark ruling from the Council of State, Greece’s highest administrative court, on the legality of 16 buildings being converted into Airbnb units in Plaka, given its protected residential status. Brought by Ellet, the action will be pivotal in determining whether land use regulations, enforced to preserve the neighbourhood’s character, have been contravened. If the judges rule in favour a precedent will be set.“The two presidential degrees establishing Plaka’s particular urban planning rules were specific. Hotels could exist but only in selected spots,” notes Dimitris Melissas, a professor of law representing Ellet at the 5 March hearing. “Here we have buildings acting as clandestine hotels, offering accommodation and breakfast and meals on terraces, where commercial activity is also strictly banned. That we argue is unconstitutional.”An epidemic of falls on the ‘mean streets’ of AthensRead moreWith soaring rents fuelling an incipient housing crisis, the centre-right government recently banned new, short-term rental registrations on online platforms in central Athens.Passed in January the legislation has raised hopes that hedge funds and developers, who moved in a decade ago, snapping up property at rock bottom prices during Greece’s debt crisis, will also begin to move on.“Foreign investors see Athens as some kind of El Dorado. They’re reaping the profits, not Greeks,” says Doukas, warning many could end up with stranded assets if they continue to defy the decrees protecting Plaka. “First, they attempted to get around the ban on hotels in the neighbourhood through Airbnb and now they’re trying to get around the ban on Airbnb by advertising properties as ‘serviced apartments’, thanks to an oversight in the new law that clearly needs to be amended.”The message, he says, is simple. Investors should “forget it” if they want to invest in short-term rentals in the neighbourhood of the gods.“Go elsewhere! Plaka is our connection with antiquity. It’s integral to the strength of Athens. We’re not going to allow it to become some tourist luna park, an endless shopping mall, denuded of residents and destroyed.”Explore more on these topicsOvertourismThe ObserverGreeceEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

The bind she finds herself in is more the stuff of a chancellor’s nightmares than dreams.Things, broadly speaking, have not gone to plan for Reeves since the end of October, at home or abroad.Growth has stalled – the Bank of England said earlier this month that it hadreduced its growth forecastfrom the 1.5% it was expecting in November to 0.75% – and borrowing costs have risen.This has meant less money in to the exchequer in taxation and more heading out of it to finance the government’s huge mountain of debt.In this double-negative scenario, bond markets have suffered bouts of jitters (though not quite Liz Truss style) putting everyone including the Treasury on edge.The£9.9bn of headroom, or spare money, which Reeves had left in the system to keep within her own “iron-clad” fiscal rules (which say she must pay for day-to-day expenses out of taxation) will in all probability have disappeared when the Office for Budget Responsibility reports ahead of her spring statement at the end of next month and lowers its forecasts again. Something has to give and soon.Government ministers roll their eyes in desperation when asked what Reeves can do. Global threats – Donald Trump’s tariffs and the effects they will have on America’s trading partners including Britain, together with demands for European countries to massively increase their defence spending, have added a sense that whatever strategy is adopted could be blown out of the water by international events.Labour MPs know there are three short-term options for Reeves. But they also know that all of them would be hugely damaging politically.View image in fullscreenDonald Trump’s trade tariffs are likely to hurt Britain’s economy.Photograph: Adam Vaughan/EPAOne is to raise taxes again at the spring budget. The second is to cut spending by more than planned already in real terms towards the end of this parliament. And the third is to break the “iron-clad” rules, and be damned.Rob Wood, chief UK economist at consultants Pantheon Macroeconomics says that while there are now some positive messages from the economy, the chancellor is almost certain to be told by the OBR in the coming weeks that all her financial leeway has indeed evaporated and that therefore she will need to cut spending or raise taxes.Not to act could be disastrous. “If the chancellor declines to take any action next month should her headroom be gone, there will be an adverse market reaction,” he said.James Smith, research director at the Resolution Foundation, agreed: “With the Treasury confirming that the fiscal rules are non-negotiable, this throws up unenviable policy choices for the chancellor – putting in place unpopular tax rises or painful cuts to public services or welfare. Failing to do this would risk a loss of confidence in financial markets.”But Reeves’s difficulties are compounded by the fact that she has explicitly, during and since the budget, ruled out going down any of the three main routes available to her.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionOn tax she has boxed herself into a very tight corner. Many economists now believe her best option on raising tax would be to extend the Tories’ freeze on tax thresholds beyond 2028, thereby reversing a pledge she made in the budget to end the freeze then. A move to extend the freeze, the Institute for Fiscal Studies says, would bring in £3.5bn to £4bn if national insurance thresholds were also frozen.But during her October budget Reeves said that extending the freeze would “hurt working people”. She added: “When it comes to choices on tax, this government chooses to protect working people every single time.” Shortly after delivering the budget she also told businesspeople that the Labour government wouldnot be “coming back for more”in tax.As for spending cuts, the pledges from Reeves and Keir Starmer not to return the country to austerity have become a mantra. More departmental spending cuts on the NHS, schools, courts or transport and sub-inflation pay rises for public sector workers would look like breaches of promises.As for breaking her fiscal rules it is, says one senior economist, the most unthinkable of all. “It would set the markets off like that. She won’t allow that to happen.”All she can do, says Ben Zaranko at the Institute for Fiscal Studies is to pray for growth. But even that looks like it would be too late.“The best way out of this fiscal bind is, of course, economic growth,” he said. “Here, the recent data is mixed. The government has announced a raft of proposals and policies aimed at boosting growth, many of which are commendably focused on the longer term.“But that’s just the problem for Reeves – an infrastructure building boom would likely deliver considerable economic benefits to the UK in future, but those growth benefits won’t arrive in time to ease the fiscal constraints she faces in the short term.”Explore more on these topicsEconomic policyThe ObserverRachel ReevesEconomic growth (GDP)EconomicsBudget deficitanalysisShareReuse this content"

Worldwide requests toGooglefor content removals have more than doubled since 2020, according to cybersecurity company Surfshark.Google is one of the world’s most powerful information gatekeepers, with billions of people using its ­products such as Search, YouTube, Drive and Chrome every day.The company regularly receives requests to take down information from national and local governments globally, as well as judiciaries, police forces and military bodies.Information can be taken down for a variety of reasons, such as copyright infringement, privacy breaches, defamation, or for violating the company’s policies.Google does not publish full data on takedown requests, but it does produce a selection of summaries about certain censorship requests it believes “may be of public interest”. These summaries are included in the company’sTransparency Report, which it updates every six months.Analysis by theObserverof this report has revealed an opaque process for removing content and incomplete data. It raises questions about Google’s role in controlling public information, and in areas such as disinformation, war propaganda and geopolitics. Critics have expressed concern that Google is “playing God”, with little oversight or regulation.TheObserveranalysed the removals data for specific countries, the types of requests made, who was making them and over what time period they were made. In some cases, where Google has set out details of specific requests, these were also analysed.After national security, the majority of global takedown requests to Google since 2020 are on the grounds of copyright, and privacy and security. Thousands of requests are categorised as “other”, with no further explanation provided by Google.One removal request can be for multiple items of content. Google, whose parent company, Alphabet, made revenues of $350bn last year, also gives figures for the total items it has “named for removal”, but does not specify how many it has actually removed.In the four years to June 2024, Russia accounted for more than 60% of takedown requests.The country’sinternet censor, Roskomnadzor,is one of the government agencies that corresponds most frequently with Google – and has earned the nickname “Rosco” in some of its reports.At the behest of Roskomnadzor, the tech company removed a YouTube video that allegedly exposed “corruption among politicians” and made “some rhetorical threats of violent action against the alleged corrupt politicians”, Google’s report said.Russian citizens were also prevented from viewing certain posts on the company’s Blogger platform, which “included criticism of Russian military history and policy, and Russian patriotic holidays. It also incited violence against residents of a Russian town,” the report said.YouTube footage of Ukrainian protesters burning a Russian flag and of people insulting Russian state symbols was also taken down.View image in fullscreenLate Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny’s tactical voting recommendations were temporarily blocked by Google during the country’s September 2021 election.Photograph: Shamil Zhumatov/ReutersIn 2022, Google censored multiple YouTube videos calling for protests against Vladimir Putin’s government. Other pieces of content that criticised Putin, including the late Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny’s tactical-voting recommendations, were temporarily blocked during the September 2021 election period. Roskomnadzor “and other Russian government entities” also asked that Googleremoved Navalny’s Smart Voting appfrom its Play store, which it did.A Kremlin cabinet minister, a senator, the boss of a state-owned bank and the head of a government agency have all sought Google’s assistance to scrub information from their domestic internet. But it is not known if Google agreed or what it removed for them, and the company did not provide further information when asked.InChina, at the request of the ministry of public security, which oversees the police and domestic political spying networks, Google took down more than 200 videos. The ministry had requested removals for 412, of which 346 “contained allegations about corruption within the political system in the People’s Republic of China or stories about top government officials”.Google also assisted in China’s crackdown on free speech, removing profiles that impersonated the country’s president, Xi Jinping.Online impersonation accounts were banned in 2015after Chinese citizens used them to covertly criticise Xi and to circumvent censorship laws, which are some of the world’s most prohibitive.View image in fullscreenThe executive government of Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei asked Google to remove content in 2016 on the grounds of ‘bullying/harassment’.Photograph: APIran’s most recent request to Google was in 2016, ruled then, as now, byits supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.

Google has not made public any further information about these requests and did not respond when asked for details.Harriet Moynihan, an associate fellow at the Chatham House thinktank, said: “Part of the right to freedom of expression is the right of access to information – which is restricted when censorship is in place.”Moynihan said that, even if Google was only removing content in line with its own guidelines, “there’s a strong broader point about whether Google and other technology companies should be operating and playing God in this way, with such little regulation.“Transparency is the big issue. We are only scratching the surface as researchers into what these tech companies are doing, including the use of their algorithms … The balance of power has shifted way in their favour.”By Google’s own admission, the examples it makes public only “provide a glimpse” of what it is asked to take down and are “not comprehensive”. Much of the data published by the company illustrates when it has stood firm against government requests, not when it has agreed to them. Nor does Google provide data on its decision-making framework or who regulates these decisions.US authorities have made more than 12,000 takedown requests since 2011 – with multiple items of content often included in a single request – but Google has published details of fewer than 40 of these.Google addresses the political nature of its role in its Transparency Report, stating: “Often times, government requests target political content and government criticism. Governments cite defamation, privacy and even copyright laws in their attempts to remove political speech from our services.“Our teams evaluate each request and review the content in context in order to determine whether or not content should be removed due to violation of local law or our content policies. We always assess the legitimacy and completeness of a government request.”The company added: “We share this information to shed light on the scale and scope of government requests for content removals. We hope to draw attention to the laws and legal processes around the world that affect access to information online.”Google does challenge takedown requests and has publicly fought with Russia over censorship. Last October, a Russian court fined the company $20 decillion,a “symbolic” sumthat is more than the world’s gross domestic product and equal to two undecillion roubles – a two followed by 36 zeros – for restricting Russian state media channels on YouTube. Russia has continued to make censorship requests to Google, however, and last did so in the period ending June 2024, the most recent data available.View image in fullscreenDays before Vladimir Putin, right, invaded Ukraine, Russia unsuccessfully asked Google to remove 600 domestic links related to the Chinese president Xi Jinping, left.Photograph: Sergey Guneyev/APDays before Russia invaded Ukraine, and before it declared a“no limits” partnership with China, Russia unsuccessfully sought the removal of 600 domestic links related to the Chinese president.

ButFriday’s speech by JD Vance, the US vice-president, has the potential to be the most consequential – the moment the world order against which Putin railed fell apart.Sometimes, even in this digital age, speeches can act as clarifiers. Yes, the 22 minutes were full of laughable hypocrisy,distorted portraits of European democracyand insensitivity to Europe’s trauma with fascism, but for what it said about the chasm in values between most in Europe and the Trump administration, it was hard to overlook.The shock was in part because the conference traditionally tends to talk about the polarisation of populism, as opposed to invite a populist to speak. The organisers had expected a dissertation onUkraine, but instead got the full populist pulpit, and therefore something more significant.The speech signalled that the pre-existing dispute between Europe and the US was no longer to do with the sharing of the military burdens, or the nature of the future security threat posed byRussia, but something more fundamental about society.It was not just a collection of cheap shots in a culture war, while a real, life-and-death military war was largely ignored. It was a call to arms for the populist right to be able to seize power inEurope, and a promise that the “new sheriff in town” would help them to do so.Speaking to the populist right, and defending digital freedom, Vance said: “Under Donald Trump’s leadership, we may disagree with your views, but we will defend your right to offer it in the public square – agree or disagree.”The greatest danger to Europe, Vance claimed, was not Russia, not China, but the “danger from within”. An entrenched elite had instrumentalised the judiciary, eroded freedom of speech to keep their cartel in power, annulled elections in Romania on flimsy intelligence and run away from voters’ valid concerns about mass migration, leaving them locked out of political debate.His conclusion was thatGermanyshould tear down its firewall, and so legitimise the populists. (He did not mention Alternative für Deutschland by name, but met the far-right party’s leader afterwards.) If it did not, he warned, Germany might not survive, since no democracy would survive “telling millions of voters that their thoughts and concerns, their hopes, their requests for help are invalid”.Vance portrayed a continent that had lost its way. Why was the security conference talking about defence budgets when it was not clear what they were actually defending? he asked. It was clear “against what” they were defending, but not clear “for what reason”.And then came the crunch, and the explicit severance. “If you’re running in fear of your own voters, there is nothing America can do for you, nor, for that matter, is there anything that you can do for the American people who elected me and elected President Trump. You need democratic mandates to accomplish anything of value in the coming years.”He continued: “For years, we’ve been told that everything we fund and support is in the name of our shared democratic values.” But he looked at Europe today and wondered why the cold war’s winners had abandoned the values that let them prevail against “tyrannical forces” on the continent.The message was implicit, but clear.Natohad been founded in the cold war as an expression of US determination to defend shared western values, but if those values were no longer shared, then the moral purpose of Nato itself fell away.In identifying Europe’s perceived faults – multiculturalism, “globalism”, migration, gay rights, liberal wokery – and in excluding Russia from criticism, the speech came close to arguing that US democracy was at best neutral on the relative values of Russia and of the European elite.For years, many Maga activists, such as Steve Bannon, have claimed an affinity with Putin’s ideologue Alexander Dugin, a man Bannon has met and praised. They both believe European elites promote a “globalist” ideology that denies the existence of different cultures and traditions. But it was one thing for Bannon to see these connections, another for them to be echoed by the White House.For the Maga movement, and for Vance, judging by his speech, the withdrawal from Europe as it exists now is not about burden-sharing, American isolationism, disputes about the trustworthiness of Putin, or even tariffs, but about an ideological fissure.Europe’s leaders at the security conference, after reeling, started a fightback, but still seemed in denial. Olaf Scholz, the German chancellor, reminded Vance that the vice-president had visited the former concentration camp Dachau this week and pledged that such unspeakable crimes against humanity would never be repeated. Germany had a historic duty to fight the return of parties with roots in nazism, Scholz said. A firewall was not about censoring AfD. It was about refusing to work with them in government.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Germany defended free speech but not fake news, he said, and hate speech and offensive speech remained subject to legal constraints and independent courts. He added: “We would never kick out a press agency from the office of our chancellor.”But when the discussion turned to the implications for Ukraine, the enormity was too much. The leaders reverted to familiar complaints about the slow delivery of air systems, sclerotic European arms production and the absence of security guarantees for Ukraine. The full consequence for European security of Trump cutting off support was downplayed.But it was Volodymr Zelenskyy who really drove home the collapse of the transatlantic alliance. He said “The US vice-president made it clear: decades of the old relationship between Europe and America are ending. From now on, things will be different, and Europe needs to adjust to that.”1:53Zelenskyy says time has come to create an 'armed forces of Europe' – videoDiscussing his recent talk with Trump, he revealed: “Not once did Trump mention that America needs Europe at that table. That says a lot. The old days are over – when America supported Europe just because it always had.”He continued: “Some in Europe may not fully understand what’s happening in Washington right now. Does America need Europe as a market? Yes, but as an ally, I don’t know. For the answer to be yes, Europe needs a single voice, not a dozen different ones.“We need confidence in our own strength so that others have no choice but to respect Europe’s power. And without a European army, that is impossible. Once again – Europe needs its own armed forces.” But how many Europeans, divided by the issues Vance highlighted, are willing to take the course that Zelenskyy urges?Explore more on these topicsEuropeJD VanceNatoEuropean UnionRussiaUkraineGermanyanalysisShareReuse this content"

It’s a shame none of us recalls exactly how good we once had it.At Christmas, I watched my daughter, somehow already a toddler, being passed between her grandfathers and thought, wistfully: she won’t remember any of this. In parks, I push her endlessly on swings, making small talk with fellow parents who have been yoked into Sisyphean servitude, and think, ruefully:whywon’t she remember any of this?Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailIn 1905, Sigmund Freud coined the term “infantile amnesia”, referring to “the peculiar amnesia which, in the case of most people, though by no means all, hides the earliest beginnings of their childhood”. More than a century later, psychologists are still intrigued by why we can’t remember our earliest experiences.“Most adults do not have memories before two to three years of age,” says Prof Qi Wang at Cornell University. Up until about age seven, memories of childhood are typically patchy.How is it that those experiences affect our life forever if they are forgotten?Until relatively recently, researchers thought that young brains weren’t developed enough to form lasting memories. Butstudies in the 1980sshowed that toddlers as young as two can form memories and recall events from months earlier in great detail. Exposure toearly childhood traumais also well documented to increase the risk of later anxiety and depression. The paradox of infantile amnesia, says Cristina Alberini, a professor of neural science at New York University, is “how is it that those experiences affect our life forever if they are forgotten?”Alberini’sresearchin animals has found that memories formed during the infantile amnesia period are, in fact, stored in the brain until adulthood, even though they aren’t consciously remembered. In both animal and human adults, forming and storing long-term memories about one’s life experiences isn’t possible without a region of the brain known as thehippocampus.Alberini’sworkhas shown that the region is also important in early memories and suggests that infantile amnesia occurs because of a critical period where the hippocampus develops due to new experiences. “It makes a lot of sense with all the literature of trauma,” she says. “If the children are learning difficult situations in early childhood, maybe they don’t remember the specifics, but their brains are going to be shaped according to that experience.”Why Māori memories emerge earlierDiffering experiences may also explain why the age at which people recall their first memories varies significantly. Wang, an expert in how culture affects autobiographical memory, has shown that theearliest memories in Americansdate from an age of about 3.5 years, almost six months younger than in Chinese people. The American memories tended to be more self-focused and emotionally elaborate, while the Chinese recollections tended to centre on collective activities and general routines, she found.“In the Asian context, identity and sense of self is less defined by being unique, but [more] about your roles and your relationship with others,” Wang says. To that end, memories may be less important for defining identity than for informing behaviour and imparting lessons. “If you want to use memory to construct a unique sense of identity, you probably remember a lot of idiosyncratic details,” Wang says.Another explanation for the discrepancy seems to be how parents discuss past experiences with their children. In New Zealand Māori, first memoriesemerge earlierthan in those of a European background, at about 2.5 years old. Prof Elaine Reese at the University of Otago, who studies autobiographical memory in children and adolescents, points to a strong emphasis on oral traditions in Māori culture but alsoelaborative conversationswhen reminiscing about past events.Reese has tracked groups of children from toddlerhood to adolescence, finding that individuals who had richer narrative environments in childhood could recallearlier and more detailed first memoriesas teenagers. This was the case for children whose mothers asked open-ended questions and were more detailed when talking aboutshared past experiences, as well as children who grew up inextended family households.“We know that from the time [children] are, say, six-month-old babies, they’re capable of some kind of mental imagery of something that happened from the previous day or week,” Reese says. “It’s taking that mental image and describing it in words that I think is so important for helping them to hold on to that memory over a lifetime.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFive Great ReadsFree weekly newsletterEach week our editors select five of the most interesting, entertaining and thoughtful reads published by Guardian Australia and our international colleagues.

Human researchers suggest memories may be limited by an inability to give language to early experiences. “But there must be something more fundamental that also plays a role because we see this same [infantile amnesia] effect in non-linguistic animals like rats,” says Prof Rick Richardson of the University of New South Wales.‘Improbably early’The brain lays down memories not as discrete files as on a computer but as networks of neurons across the brain. Recalling a memory activates those networks and strengthens the links between neurons. This is not to say memory is stable: “Every time you revisit a memory and think about it, you’re changing it,” Reese says.Repeated suggestions can lead people to create images and formfalse memories, Wang says, citing a famous case in Jean Piaget, the influential child development psychologist. Piaget had a clear memory of his nanny fighting off a would-be kidnapper when he was two – but years later, she confessed that she had fabricated the story.In a2018 survey, 39% of respondents reported their first memories occurred at age two or younger. The researchers suggested that “improbably early” memories, such as recollections of being pushed in a pram or walking for the first time, were likely fictional and based on photographs or family stories. But though memory is malleable and young children are more suggestible, “confabulation is not that common”, Wang says. “Under normal conditions, even children do not just take for granted whatever you tell them and incorporate those memories.”So if experiences of our early milestones – first birthday, first steps, first trip to the beach – seem to be cached somewhere in the brain, why can’t we consciously access them? While psychologists say it can be adaptive to forget, that doesn’t explain why the memories formed before age seven seem to decay faster than when we’re adults. Alberini hypothesises that early unrecalled memories may function as schemas upon which adult memories are built. Like the foundations of a home, they remain concealed but crucial.Explore more on these topicsScienceChildrenfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Archive image: courtesy of Sara CoxBorn in Bolton, Greater Manchester, in 1974, Sara Cox began her career as a model before becoming a presenter on Channel 4’s The Girlie Show in 1996. In 2000, she took over BBC Radio 1’s breakfast show, hosting for three years. She now presents for BBC Radio 2, fronted TV shows includingBetween the Covers, and has published two novels. Cox lives in London with her husband, Ben Cyzer, and three children. This month, she and her best friend Clare Hamilton launch Teen Commandments, a podcast about parenting adolescents.SaraThis was taken in Granada. We had ciggies on the go and decided to have a pamper session, but as we only had one face mask we had to rip it up and plonk on as many bits as we could. The rest of the day would have involved room service and a few hours of telly, specifically Jerry Springer and Montel Williams. Then we’d probably have ventured out to our plunge pool to do handstands. We were a couple of crackpots back then. Absolutely wild.I met Clare when we were teen models. That sounds glamorous, but only a small percentage of models make real money. The rest are girls like us trying to avoid going to university. At the time, my family lived above a pub in Bolton called The Pineapple. Mum was working every hour God sent, while I didn’t lift a single finger. I was mainly lounging around going: “I can’t do the dishes! I’ve just painted my nails!” So when I was offered a five-month job in Korea, Mum’s reaction was: “Where do I sign?”I arrived in Seoul a few weeks before Clare, and had been hanging out with two Mormon girls from Hawaii. They were God-fearing and very different from the 17-year-old me, who was immersed in rave culture and mostly friends with lads. When Clare arrived I was thrilled. She’s from Whitefield, down the road from Bolton, so as soon as I heard her accent I knew I’d be OK. I asked her two questions to pass the friendship test: “Do you drink coffee, and do you smoke?” Thankfully, she answered yes to both.Meeting Clare was great for me, but not so much for the people who hired us. We did one shoot in a location that involved a long ride in a minibus. Everyone else fell asleep immediately; they were sensible and knew it would be nonstop work for 12 hours when we arrived. Meanwhile, we decided to stay up, laughing. We were exhausted for the shoot, and so giddy when we got back to the hotel that Clare was wearing my pants on her head and claiming she saw a ghost.We did all the red carpets together. I was asked to interview Eminem in New York, and, as record companies had loads of money back then, Clare was allowed to comeIn the end, I got sent back to Bolton for bad behaviour. I’d put on weight as I was eating a lot of comfort food, mainly hard-boiled eggs. I also missed a shoot because I was so hungover. Our hotel was next to an American army base, and me and Clare were drinking a lot with GIs. They loved a British accent – every time I went to light a cigarette, eight Zippos would get whipped out.The moral of this story isn’t: “Lose your job and get sent home.” But it kind of is, because when I got back to the UK I got a call asking if I wanted to go to a casting for The Girlie Show. I’d have missed it otherwise.Clare and I did all the award red carpets and film premieres together. I was asked to interview Eminem in New York, and, as record companies had loads of money back then, Clare was allowed to come with me. He was super-sweet and we even went to an Italian restaurant afterwards with his 20-strong entourage. When the bill came, they played credit-card roulette – we all threw our cards on to the table and whichever one the waitress picked would have to pay the whole lot. Me and Clare sat on our hands, terrified.Because we’ve lived far apart for decades we’ve had to make other friends. But Clare is my bestest friend, and bridesmaid, which makes me sound 11 years old and quite pathetic. I love her for lots of reasons: she is patient with me when I wang on, and I can be grumpy with her and know that she knows my bark is worse than my bite. Clare is also really badass – she brought up two little kids on her own and is one of the toughest people I know.Clare is my absolute soulmate. Sometimes my phone background is a photo of her in a Jacuzzi – as if she’s my wife. In fact, don’t ask me to choose between her and my husband, because it wouldn’t be pretty. When we’re together, we’re the Sara and Clare club. Even now when she stays over and my husband comes in the room, we’ll look at him like: “Yeah, can we help you?” Not that he minds. He loves it when she’s visiting. He gets a break from me.ClareTV presenter Olivia Attwood looks back: ‘I was a big character on Love Island, but it was all bravado’Read moreThis was one of many brilliant holidays we’ve had together. The hotel was quite romantic and full of older couples; meanwhile, Sara and I were having margaritas at breakfast.I was 17 and had only been modelling for a few weeks when I was asked if I wanted to go to Seoul. Everything about Korea felt alien to me, so it was such a relief to hear Sara’s voice shout “Hullo!” from the steps of the apartment when I arrived. We were finishing each other’s sentences straight away; already inseparable.The rest of our time there was a mix of homesickness and hysterics. I remember being measured and weighed all the time, but we were drinking a lot of Soju and partying. At breakfast they’d bring a bowl with a crab in broth and we’d have to eat it with chopsticks. To this day, we’re both still quite handy with a pair.In the early days of Sara’s career, we’d go to events and be the ones giggling in the corner, watching all the action happen. Then suddenly everyone wanted to speak to her. There was a big shift, but I loved getting a side seat to someone else’s success. I got to do all the fun things without any of the pressure of having to be public-facing. In 1997, we went to the Batman and Robin premiere and wore matching dresses I got for my 21st birthday. They were quite low cut and I kept telling Sara to make sure everything stayed in place, but she obviously got distracted. In the end some guy tapped me on the shoulder and said: “Sorry to bother you, but both of your boobs are out.”As well as the highs, Sara has supported me through some tough periods. It was a very dark time when I became a single mum: I had a baby and a two-year-old. As soon as the relationship ended, I shoved everything I owned in the boot in bin bags and drove straight to London. That’s testament to our friendship. It could be 3am, and if I’m having a shitty time I know she’ll be there.I can’t imagine my life without Sara. A lot of people make friends for life at university, but we were on a dusty backstreet in Seoul. Not much has changed since – she is still hilarious, inspirational and selfless. And now the kids are teens, I can finally see holidays, talkshows and face masks back on our horizon.Explore more on these topicsSara CoxFlashbackFriendshipfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I was used to having admirers – groupies not so much.I was on tour in Brisbane when members of a gay and lesbian alliance made a group booking and invited me to a party after my show. One of the members, Scott, was assigned as my chaperone. He was tall, handsome and youthful. In the taxi back to my hotel after the party, I asked Scott if he wanted to visit me the next day. He said yes. As I got out of the taxi, I held his finger as a goodbye gesture. It seemed a tenuous connection.But the next day Scott turned up at my hotel room overlooking the Brisbane River. He was in his 20s and I was in my 50s but I found his intellectual curiosity and passion for gay politics immensely attractive. When the talking was over, we lay on the bed and kissed for a long time; nothing further – Scott was someone who didn’t like to be rushed.The moment I knew: as two pythons writhed above us, I realised our lives would always be intertwinedRead moreA few weeks later he came to visit me in Sydney, where it became clear our 30-year age gap was just the start of our differences. I’m a bleeding-heart artist with a hard edge, while Scott’s head was always in a book about history, science or visual art. I was relieved, however, that he liked classical music – the last thing I wanted was to wake up to someone playing gay disco anthems over breakfast.Over the following months and years, we fell into the rhythm of a long-distance relationship, visiting each other every couple of months – I’d stay in his sharehouse in Brisbane, and he’d come to my home in Sydney. Together, Scott and I would visit art galleries, go to shows, meet up for holidays and go on meandering bushwalks – me taking photos, Scott lending a forensic eye to the plants we passed. Although we maintained an open relationship, Scott and I began introducing each other to friends and family as “my boyfriend” or “my partner”. But the most important thing we had in common was we both liked living alone. Neither of us wanted to live in the other’s pocket.Then, in 2010, my brother Alan died suddenly in Brisbane. Amid the shock and grief I found myself in charge of arranging the funeral. There were hundreds of things to do. As family tensions resurfaced when my sister and nephew flew out from the United States, Scott was by my side as a stabilising presence. After the funeral we still hadn’t found Alan’s will, but Scott used his clerical skills to methodically trawl through Alan’s papers until he found it. I’d had lots of lovers, but during this crisis I realised Scott was someone I could depend on – who I wanted in my life.View image in fullscreen‘I realised Scott was someone I could depend on’: William and Scott in the United States in 2022Getting older has made me re-evaluate what I look for in a relationship, and trust is the number one quality. Although we continue to live in separate states of Australia and keep our relationship open, six years ago I gave Scott power of attorney, which is the act of giving your life over to another person.

She grew up in north London and is a contributing editor at the leftwing websiteNovara Media. A regular pundit on TV and radio, she made waves with aviral 2018 appearanceon ITV’sGood Morning Britain, where she clashed with Piers Morgan, telling him: “I’m literally a communist, you idiot.” Her first book,Minority Rule: Adventures in the Culture War(Bloomsbury), is a lively analysis of how the ruling classes purposefully misdirect political blame by stoking the fear that minorities are working to oppress the majority.What does “minority rule” mean to you?I realised that every moral panic – whether it was trans rights, BLM [Black Lives Matter], Extinction Rebellion – was 1,000 doors opening on to the same place. The story was: here are these minorities who want to tell you how to live. But at the same time, I believe society is governed by minority rule – oligarchic power, corporate power, the way in which electoral systems devalue the votes of people who live in densely populated areas. So minority rule describes both this moral panic and the true state of affairs.Who is the book’s ideal reader?Somebody who shares political content on Instagram, but doesn’t have a job in politics; someone who consumes a bit of news media, but isn’t an obsessive. They could think of themselves as anywhere from very left wing to in the middle. My hope is that I meet them where they’re at, and give them the tools to perform their own analysis.And what should readers expect to learn from it?It starts by looking at how identity became the dominant preoccupation among progressives, then it goes on to examine media, lobby journalism, electoral politics and the insurgent far right – and how all of these forces contribute to breaking down unity among the majority of people who aren’t part of the super-wealthy. What I hope readers will learn is that a big part of formal democracy is about making sure that ordinary people don’t identify their shared interests with one another.So how do we break free of minority rule, especially in light ofgenZ, whom recent research found are disillusioned with democracy?I wish I had a simple answer! Obviously young people are growing disillusioned with democracy – all they’ve ever known is democratic representatives and institutions telling them: “No, sorry, things can’t get better and you’re an idiot for thinking anything different.” I think the starting point is thinking, working and organising with building majority coalitions in mind. That doesn’t mean abandoning causes like anti-racism or trans rights, but understanding that you’re going to have to speak to the issues that the majority of people are contending with if you want to get anywhere.The family business was social work – which is like growing up in the mafia except everyone’s an active listenerWhere do your politics come from?I grew up in a family where women talked about politics all the time. My grandma was an anti-racist activist. My mum was an anti-racist activist and trade unionist. But the family business was social work, which is like growing up in the mafia except everyone’s an active listener. The fact that my mum, my auntie, my grandma would be talking about things they observed at work – like the way in which for children who have been in care, there’s a pipeline that can end in prison because of state failings – was massively impactful for shaping my thinking.What has been your experience of XsinceElon Musktook over?I interact a lot less than I used to because I know underneath is going to be a hailstorm of racism. It’s got continually worse since Musk’s takeover. You can report it. Nothing will get done. The other day I saw someone tweet: “Ash Sarkar would be so easy to rape.” I worry that something really bad is going to happen [to me] in the real world, and it will cause my mum and husband so much pain – just because of the job I choose to do.Has that changed the way you live?I’m very careful. I don’t share [online] where I am when I’m there – ever. I prefer facing doors when I’m sitting down. I’m a lot jumpier than I used to be.What made you want to write a book, given that you’d get wider reach on TV or radio?McDonald’s sells more food than Ottolenghi, but one is better for you. I think broadcast is really important, and the success of Joe Rogan and Theo Von demonstrates the appetite for long-form interviews. But conventional broadcast is way behind social media for meeting the desires of its audience. And I never learned much of value from TV. The things that made me feel like I had the ability to marshal the chaos of the world into some kind of comprehensible shape were books.What were those books?Black Skin, White Masksby Frantz Fanon.The Communist Manifesto, obviously. Stuart Hall’s essays The Neo-Liberal Revolution, The Great Moving Right Show, New Ethnicities – banger after banger after banger.What about fiction?I love Hilary Mantel’s work. I’m a Mantel stan. InA Place of Greater Safetyand theWolf Halltrilogy you see that moment-to-moment decision-making of people who want to hold power, and you see those moments where it just slips out of their grasp. I also love Jane Austen. I love that her books are just people going over to each other’s houses.What book would you give to a young person?I think any person who is interested in writing should look at the facsimile edition ofThe Waste Land, where you’ve got the original TS Eliot draft and then you see where Ezra Pound drew straight lines through, like “no, no, no”. It tells you how important an editor is, and how shape comes from being willing to take things away.Are you hopeful that you’ll see political change during your lifetime?Antonio Gramsci spoke of “pessimism of the intellect and optimism of the will”. I don’t think it’s likely, but if you’re not hopeful, what are you doing?Minority Rule: Adventures in the Culture Warby Ash Sarkar is published by Bloomsbury (£18.99).

This week, that extra cost will appear in figures that City analysts say will showinflationjumped to 2.8% in January, from 2.5% in December and 1.7% last September.The Bank of England says inflation will keep rising towards 3.7% this year. The National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR) has predicted the rate will rise to 3.2% in 2025.After the price shock of the past two years, the return of inflation will come as a financial wrecking ball to many households and businesses as prices growth begins to match or overtake wages growth once again.Living standards have improved for some over the past 18 months as wage rises have outpaced prices, but the outlook shows that may not last.In another blow to the government’s plans to improve its standing with the public,unemploymentis also on course to edge higher.There was a moment of cheer for the government last week when data showed the economy grew in the last quarter of 2024, confounding many City analysts. The increase was only 0.1%, but the economy was expected to shrink, giving Rachel Reeves a surprise boost.This week may not be so generous to the chancellor. Any hopes that a better-than-expected rate of growth last year would feed into the jobs market in the first months of 2025 are likely to be dashed.City analysts not only expect a jump in the consumer price index (CPI) measure of inflation, they are also predicting that the unemployment rate will increase from 4.4% to 4.5%. In August 2022 the unemployment rate was 3.6%. Continuing the trend, the Bank of England says unemployment could reach 4.75% by the end of the year.Stagflation is the word used by many analysts to describe an economy blighted by high inflation and high unemployment, and there will be many who will use it should the inflation and unemployment figures track expectations.However, not every forecaster is so gloomy. Rob Wood, chief UK economist at the consultants Pantheon Macroeconomics, says the unemployment rate will be restricted to 4.5% and CPI will end the year at 3.1%.Trump could also use the threat of flooding the market with cheap US gas and oil if Vladimir Putin refuses to make concessionsEconomists recognise, though, that there is a strong probability their forecasts, in particular for inflation, could be wildly inaccurate.Donald Trump’s mission to end theUkrainewar could bring a rush of cheap energy on to the world market, cutting prices at a rapid rate.A more normal, prewar energy market could cut the cost of oil and gas for European users, especially as the weather is already beginning to warm up.Trump could also use the threat of flooding the market with cheap US gas and oil if Vladimir Putin refuses to make concessions, making it more difficult for Russian suppliers to make a profit and worsening Moscow’s finances.Either way, global energy prices would fall and inflation with it.In the UK, the impact is likely to be muted if the government sticks with the energy price cap. The cap lessened the impact of gas price rises before Christmas by restricting how much suppliers could pass on in higher bills.A 1.2% increase in the cap between 1 January to 31 March to £1,738 a year for a typical household will feature in the January inflation rate. However, analysts are predicting a rise of about 5% to 7% in April, followed by a further rise in July, even if prices at the moment are dropping.Trump’s threat to impose trade tariffs is also haunting the UK jobs market. Plenty of firms have indicated that global political and economic uncertainty has deterred them from hiring staff. It’s a situation likely to persist while Trump uses the threat of tariffs to meet his political goals.Benjamin Caswell, an economist at the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, said last week that forecasting was becoming especially hard in the second Trump presidency. Predicting how businesses will react to the uncertainty and threat of extra costs from tariffs, and what impact this will have on jobs, inflation and the economic outlook, was becoming more challenging every week, he said.Explore more on these topicsInflationObserver business agendaGasOilCommoditiesUkraineEuropeEconomicsanalysisShareReuse this content"

It’s a really involving picture which beckons you hypnotically towards the tacit promise of a sensationally unhappy and violent denouement, and of course Franco is unlikely to deliver any other kind. The two final plot developments are shocking, if not precisely surprising, and in fact vulnerable to the charge of being crudely obvious – but Franco certainly gives us a gripping emotional drama, supercharged with toxic sensuality and fear.Jessica Chastain plays Jennifer McCarthy, a wealthy woman based in San Francisco extensively accustomed to high-end restaurants, couture, private planes and chauffeur-driven SUVs and Franco has an eye for the luxury-porn scenarios familiar from TV dramas such as Succession and The White Lotus, though with a more dyspeptic and fearful edge.Jennifer’s full-time job is administering various high-minded arts projects made possible by the colossally wealthy endowment set up by her widowed father Michael (Marshall Bell); her more unreflective brother Jake (Rupert Friend) manages other parts of the fund. She is always to be seen walking, with various attendant functionaries, through the architecturally vast modernist lobbies of galleries and theatres that her dad’s money has bankrolled. One of Jennifer’s projects is a dance school in Mexico City where she has met and had a passionate fling with ballet star Fernando (played by real-life dancer Isaac Hernández) and rather tactlessly left him a lot of cash before she left.Fernando uses that money to get over the border into Texas as an illegal and then hitches to San Francisco to see Jennifer who is overwhelmed with the transgressive, erotic excitement of a star-crossed romance.Yet Fernando himself, disclosing a proud and prickly personality, is upset when Jennifer won’t be seen with him in public with her grand friends. As for Jennifer, she is furious and excluded when he chats with Mexican-immigrant waiters in Spanish — she herself can only speak with Mexicans through her phone’s Google translate app: absurdist moments that reveal unthinking arrogance. At first Fernando has all the power by withdrawing haughtily from her and retreating as she obsessively and woundedly follows him and Franco lets us suspect some kind of grisly Ruth Ellis situation.But what exactly is it that Jennifer imagines for them both in the long term? Marriage would solve Fernando’s problems as an illegal, and Jennifer is divorced, something that may or may not have something to do with an inability to have children. Remarriage might affect her position in the family estate – and remarriage to a Mexican, someone whom the family is prepared to countenance as one of their artist serfs, would be something else again.Franco shows us a panorama of hidden cruelty and racism, and shows us the condescension involved in super-rich arts patronage, of which the slumming excitement of wealth-gap sex is a part, perhaps even a kind of kink. In so far as they think about the art they subsidise, the McCarthy family solemnly believe that their Mexicans are artistic because they are alienated and poor, a picturesque underclass of talent on their doorstep – close and maybe too close. It is quite a vision: mordant, satirical, brutal.Dreams screened at theBerlin film festival.Explore more on these topicsFilmBerlin film festivalFestivalsJessica ChastainreviewsShareReuse this content"

But it was still bright, golden – as vibrant as my mum had been. On the drive home along the Tasmanian coastline Mum had loved so much, the sea spread out to the horizon in rolls of brilliant emerald.Being with her in the months, days and hours up to her death from cancer was the hardest thing I have ever done. It also felt like the most important.And there was one piece of information that allowed us to recognise what was happening at a crucial moment: a sign that death was close.This information was imparted by a nurse whose name I don’t know. She pulled us aside in the hospital corridor when it suddenly became apparent they wouldn’t be sending Mum home with a dose of antibiotics like the times before.The nurse asked if we knew there are often changes to someone’s breathing shortly before death: alternations between periods of shallow breathing, deeper rapid breaths and sometimes substantial pauses known as Cheyne-Stokes breathing.This meant that several days later, when her breathing did exactly this, rather than calling for a nurse to ask what was happening, my dad, brother, sister-in-law and I spoke to Mum as she died.It meant Mum died hearing the voices of her family telling her how much we loved her; she died being held.None of us wants to think about death. But pretending it won’t happen may not be the best option | Simon SmartRead moreThere are some other things I wish we had known about death in the months beforehand – things that were confronting, heartbreaking, signs of impending death we missed entirely or which we misunderstood as meaning she had more time left.And while every death is different, experts say knowing some of the common signs that it may be near can change the experience for both the person at the end of their life and their loved ones.Dr Kerrie Noonan, a clinical psychologist and director of the Death Literacy Institute, says that today most people are quite removed from death, dying and illness – meaning we may not recognise signs that someone is approaching the end of their life.“So, when those signs come, we often haven’t seen them before and are relying on health professionals to point them out,” says Noonan, an adjunct associate professor at La Trobe University’s public health palliative care unit. “And if that doesn’t happen, they can be quite shocking and difficult to cope with.”Understanding the signsJason Mills, a registered nurse and associate professor at Flinders University’s research centre for palliative care, death and dying, says the dying process – from months to hours before death – varies for everyone and there will be different symptoms and trajectories even among those with the same illness.But he says there are some common changes when someone’s body is shutting down due to advanced illness or age-related decline.Eating and drinking decreases, and may stop altogether. This can be upsetting to loved ones, Mills says, because food has such a prominent place in our social and family lives.But he stresses: “It’s not that they’re giving up on you or that they don’t love you. Their body just can’t tolerate it any more.”Ken Hillman, professor of intensive care at the University of New South Wales and director of the Simpson Centre for health services research, says “becoming weaker, not moving around as much, drifting in and out of consciousness” are all common.As is delirium, which may range from confusion, drowsiness and delusions, to hallucinations, euphoria and agitation.I’m not trying to romanticise death – it’s not easy, but it’s an important part of lifeJason MillsSome dying people experience a surge inmental clarityor energy levels in their final days or hours. This may offer a chance for lucid goodbyes – but can also give friends and family false hope the person is recovering.Irregular, loud and laboured breathingcan also be distressing to hear, or make it seem the person has died before they actually have.“It can be really frightening when you’re at the bedside of someone dying, and the period of them not breathing is very, very long and so relatives think they’ve passed, then suddenly they take this huge breath,” Hillman says.Mills recommends asking a health professional if you’re concerned by something, since there are often things that help – including adjusting positions, medication or sometimes simply an explanation.“For example, rattly breathing can be really distressing for family and people around someone who’s dying, and often clinicians can prescribe [medication], because ultimately the noisy breathing is due to fluid secretions accumulating at the back of the throat … but it’s not actually causing distress or harm to the dying person.”Both experts encourage holding the dying person’s hand or gently stroking their forehead, and continuing to speak to them.“I always tell relatives hearing is the last to go,” Hillman says.‘Death-denying society’Hillman says the medicalisation of death – while alleviating a lot of suffering – can mean social and spiritual aspects are forgotten.“We live in a death-denying society,” Hillman says, noting that since doctors are “programmed to cure people” even they can struggle to step back and recognise that someone is dying.Pressure to do everything possible to extend life can come from both families and health professionals, Mills adds. “Whether it’s tacit or otherwise, death is often seen as a medical failure.”Cultural and religious beliefs also influence if and how death is discussed.My brother and father drowned on a bright summer day. Swimming brings me closer to the two men I’ve lost | Indigo PerryRead moreEliza Munro, a Gamilaroi woman and sorry business consultant with Ngiyani Wandabaa, is exploring death and dying in First Nations communities globally as a Churchill fellow.She says beliefs vary across communities. In some, death is celebratory – a return to ancestors; some hold to Christian concepts of heaven and hell; and for some,talking about death and dying is taboo and often seen as “manifesting death”.“[If it’s taboo] this impacts access to palliative care and planning ahead for sorry business and sad news … as well as the cultural protocols after someone has passed,” Munro says.Munro and Mills both stress that not knowing a person’s wishes for their death and beyond can affect the grieving process and have significant financial impacts on families trying to make decisions for them.Mills says avoiding the topic also means missing opportunities to support others.“If we’re all busy being in denial about death, what often happens is people disappear – when they find out someone is dying, they think, ‘That’s scary, I don’t know what to say’.”“Death literacyis our ‘knowhow’ around death, dying, loss and grief, and how that helps us to plan better and to be prepared for end-of-life and death experiences,” says Noonan, who helped develop the concept anda tool to measure it.Using this index in asurvey of 1,202 Australians(chosen to be nationally representative, though the full data is not yet published), Noonan says death literacy appeared to grow between 2019 and 2023, with Covid-19 and the introduction of voluntary assisted dying laws triggering more learning about end of life.For all of us, information helps reduce the fear of the unknown.“Uncertainty tends to cause stress and anxiety … so whether you read some information, or have a conversation with a friend – if you can find a way to alleviate that uncertainty, your anxiety and stress, on one level, can come down,” Noonan says.Even withextensive planning,supportand a knowledge of the most common signs, Mills also reminds family and friends to be gentle with themselves, as dying is unpredictable.“When someone has been spending hours on end by someone’s bedside wanting to be there the moment they die, then the moment they walk away to go to the toilet, that person dies … it’s not helpful to beat ourselves up and say, ‘I should have done this or that,’” he says.Alongside decision-making, he says discussions about death can help us to live more meaningfully.“I’m not trying to romanticise death – it’s not easy, but it’s an important part of life and the better we can understand it and prepare for it, then I think we’re all better for it, individually and collectively.”In Australia, support is available atBeyond Blueon 1300 22 4636,Lifelineon 13 11 14, and atMensLineon 1300 789 978.

But here’s how we in gen Z really feelRecent surveys claim to have discovered a lot of alarming things about my generation. But they’re not telling you the whole storyOpinion: Not wanting to die for Britain doesn’t make gen Z stupidKate McCuskerSat 15 Feb 2025 12.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 15 Feb 2025 12.59 ESTShareOne of the most ignominious accusations that has recently been levelled against gen Z – people born between 1997 and 2012 – is that we cannot do DIY.Nearly a quarter of us can’t change a lightbulb, a fair chunk can’t identify a flathead screwdriver, and a fifth don’t even know what a spanner is, according to research by DIY enthusiasts’ favouriteHalfords, which surveyed 2,000 people, 323 of which were aged between 18 and 27. (I should get out of the way early that I was born in 1997 and no, I don’t know my flathead screwdrivers from whatever the other ones are called.)The commentators, as they are wont to do, had a field day. “Why young people can’t handle DIY,” ranone headline, as though it were national service. “Revealed: the basic DIY tasks gen Z won’t do – as young adults pay thousands of pounds for others to do easy household tasks,”said another. Op-eds were commissioned. Radio producers were dispatched to social media to seek these feckless layabouts out for a soundbite. Instead of a nation of DIYers like great generations past, we have, according to the people who sold bikes before we all started Living in the Moment Everyday (limeing), become a generation of Gotdits – the get others to do it-ers. It practically trips off the tongue.If young people knew going to work resulted in a decent standard of living, if they knew they could get a hospital appointment, I think attitudes would completely changeJovan Owusu-Nepaul, ex-Labour candidateRegrettably, though, it’s not just “basic DIY” that we’d outsource completely if given the chance. According to recent – and, yes, markedly more worrying – research from Channel 4, 52% of gen Z would chuck democracy in for a “strong leader” who “doesn’t have to bother with parliament and elections”. (This from a sample size of 3,000 adults of all ages.) Not only that, but 47% agreed that “the entire way our society is organised must be radically changed through revolution”. A not insignificant margin – 33% – thought the UK would be “better off if the army were in charge”.Hot on the heels of this was polling from theMail on Sunday, which found that 45% of 18- to 27-year-olds supported the death penalty, and 67% were in favour of chemically castrating sex offenders. The revelation that my generation can’t change a lightbulb suddenly feels quite small-fry.Last week, in the latest dispatch from the gen Z trenches, theTimesand YouGov published a survey of 1,161 adults aged 18 to 27 (comparable to a similar report the paper ran in 2004) exploring their views on everything from national pride (no chance) to one night stands (very much not happening). Just 41% of those surveyed said they were proud to be British (this compared with 80% in 2004); only 11% would fight for their country; almost half thought that Britain was racist; and only 11% would trust the police “a lot” if they were the victim of a crime.View image in fullscreenYoung people are reported to be drinking less but also to be relaxed about the decriminalisation of recreational drugs.Photograph: seksan Mongkhonkhamsao/Getty ImagesConfronting reading? Yes. Unexpected? Not exactly. As Jovan Owusu-Nepaul, the impeccably dressed 28-year-old who stood against Nigel Farage in Clacton at last July’s general election, tells me: “If young people knew that going to work resulted in a decent standard of living, if they knew that they could get a hospital appointment, if they had confidence in the areas they were living, they felt a sense of community and solidarity among people, they knew their neighbours, they were proud of the contributions of their town to the national story, then I think those attitudes would completely change.”Instead, it feels like the social contract has been torn up, put in an envelope and mailed back to us alongside a statement from the Student Loans Company. The labour market’s a dud, starting salaries are risibly paltry, owning so much as a parking space is a pipe dream and the great, terrible truth is that we’re heading for an uninhabitable planet. When I canvass my own friends for their thoughts on the state of the nation, the answers variously come back as “a joke”, “a mess” and “girl, I’ve literally just been Googling how to move to Australia”. It’s not exactly life-affirming stuff.“With gen Z, so much of politics has been donetous, and there have been so many really big decisions taken that we have been locked out of,” says 22-year-old Issy Waite, the national secretary of Labour Students, who stood in Kemi Badenoch’s North West Essex seat as the party’s youngest candidate last July. “Whatever your views on Brexit, a lot of gen Z didn’t have the option to even exercise our opinion – and this is a life-changing decision that’s going to affect the rest of our lives.”“Young people seem to think that the picture’s broken,” says Joshua Reynolds, the 26-year-old Lib Dem MP for Maidenhead, a seat that was held by Theresa May for 27 years until she stepped down at the general election. He is one of the first generation Z MPs. “I think it’s a feeling of, well, what has politics done for me?View image in fullscreenJovan Owusu-Nepaul: ‘Our generation has been politicised because the promise of what was meant to be pretty standard in society has completely broken down.’Photograph: Martin Suker“I don’t in reality think that young people want to get rid of elections or democracy. I think it’s that democracy and politics and politicians haven’t listened to young people for so long. They feel disillusioned by it.”Which is probably why we’re already feeling the creep of “strong leader” syndrome. Reynolds says he visited a school in his constituency a few weeks ago and asked some of the students to name three politicians. “The answers were Nigel Farage, Boris Johnson and Elon Musk.”Reynolds isn’t the only one unconvinced that democracy is as out of fashion with gen Z as Channel 4’s polling would suggest. “It just seemed wrong,” says Chris Prosser, a political scientist and co-director of theBritish Election Study, who pointed out that the response to the “strong leader” question contradicted other data from the British Election Study and the World Values Survey – the former byalmost 40 percentage points.“I’m obviously biased, but we’re quite a well regarded organisation, and according to our research, gen Z are theleastlikely generation to support a ‘strong leader’. There are all sorts of reasons that number might have arisen.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The broadcaster had toldtheGuardianin a previous statement that it was “a robust, reliable and carefully thought through piece of research”.When it came to theTimesstudy, despite liberal views on issues such as trans rights (most of those surveyed thought pupils should be allowed to socially transition at school), drug decriminalisation (those in favour of decriminalising cannabis, ecstasy and cocaine had increased significantly in the past two decades), and immigration (76% thought it was good for the economy and society), gen Z’s monastic reputation preceded us in other areas.View image in fullscreenChris Prosser of the British Election Study says that, contrary to other findings, his organisation’s research suggests gen Z are the least likely people to support a ‘strong leader’.Photograph: handout from Chris ProsserJust 33% believed their friends were frequent binge drinkers, just 16% thought their peers were having regular casual sex, and – maybe most surprisingly – more young people believed in the institution of marriage in 2024 than they did in 2004.“There’s a positive and a negative story to be found” about gen Z’s relationship with sex, says Natasha McKeever, a lecturer in applied ethics at the University of Leeds. “The negative is that gen Z are interacting less in person, and interacting more over screens. If they’re meeting less in person, they’re less likely to have sex or date. But the positive spin on that is that they’re drinking less, they’re less likely to have drunk sex, and they’re more clued up on things thanks to better sex and relationships education in schools.”McKeever’s research reflects what I’ve been hearing rumbles of among my own friends over the past year: dating apps are dying a death among beleaguered young singles. (No wonder Bridget Jones, a woman who only had to walk downstairs at her own parents’ turkey-curry Christmas buffet to meet the love of her life, hasfound such an ardent new young audience.)“It seems like, actually, young people don’t want to be hiding behind screens – they seem to be craving something different and authentic,” says McKeever. According to a report published by the alternative dating app Feeld last September, gen Z was the most likely age group to report having fantasised about monogamy.And yet, there is still humour, albeit gallows-style, and there is some remaining sense of hope – at least in the people I speak to.“This sense of injustice that people feel is motivating,” says Owusu-Nepaul. “I think our generation has been politicised just because the promise of what was meant to be pretty standard in society has completely broken down.”As one friend reasons when we, two tipsy statistical anomalies, talk about it over a glass of wine: “At least we’re not America. Yet.”I’ll drink to that.Explore more on these topicsYoung peopleThe ObserverSocial trendsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

For Jannik Sinner, thethree-month ban he has acceptedfrom the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) is less than he might have received had he let the appeal go the natural distance. While he will miss almost nothing of note, at least in terms of grand slams, since the world No 1 will be free to return in early May, ready for the French Open and a shot at a third successive major title and fourth in total.ForWada, Sinner’s partial admission of responsibility holds up a key part of the anti-doping programme: that an individual is responsible for what goes in their body, a responsibility that extends to their entourage. And for the sporting world at large, it’s something of a rebuttal to those who say the superstars get preferential treatment.‘A sad day for tennis’: critics round on Sinner after three-month ban agreedRead moreHaving therecently crowned Australian Open championreceive a drugs ban is not a good look for the sport, of course, but it could have been a lot worse. In appealing against the original decision by the International Tennis Integrity Agency (ITIA) not to ban Sinner, Wada said it was seeking a ban of at least a year.The three-month settlementmeans it will be out of the way before the next grand slam begins at Roland Garros in May.Sinner will be breathing a big sigh of relief, no doubt. A lengthy ban would have been a heavy weight to bear for something that he, the ITIA and Wada all agreed was not his personal fault. If the explanation given – that the clostebol accidentally entered the Italian’s system via contamination from a medicine used by his physio to treat a cut finger – seemed a little fanciful, few inside tennis believed that Sinner had actually tried to cheat.Indeed, had there been a provision in the original case for a three-month ban to be issued, Sinner might have settled for that, too. It would have allowed him to say: ‘OK, I know I did nothing wrong myself, but appreciate that my entourage did and accept my fate.’ As it was, the panel that judged the case was restricted to handing out a minimum 12-month ban if it felt he was guilty.That, too, was surely a factor in the Wada settlement. From 2027, more flexibility will be shown to those who fall foul of contamination in doping cases.Panels will be allowed to issue bans of 0-24 months, offering the likelihood that those who can prove their doping sample was the result of a contamination will receive shorter bans. It’s a safe bet Sinner’s lawyers were stressing that point.View image in fullscreenSimona Halep was also a victim of contamination but was treated less kindly.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianThe settlement will have done little to appease the feeling among some other players, however, especially Simona Halep and Britain’s Tara Moore. Both players were also the victim of contamination: Sinner was treated with greater kindness than they were.The cases of Halep and Moore were significantly different to that of Sinner, more complicated and requiring more assessment, but it’s also true that Sinner, as the world No 1 and a rich man, had the luxury of being able to call on a team of lawyers immediately.Throughout the entire case, Sinner has done a decent job of answering every question asked of him in press conferences, something that may sound like a given, but which nevertheless helps him in terms of the way he is perceived by people inside and outside tennis.All the way through, he has suggested the reason he has been able to continue to play his best tennis has been because his conscience is clear, that he personally had done nothing wrong.With the doubt lifted from his shoulders, it seems likely Sinner will continue to be the man to beat. The Italian lost six matches in 2024 and began this year in brilliant fashion, winning the Australian Open to claim his third major.Three months off might halt his momentum but it might also allow for recovery after an intense period on and off the court. The chances are that when he does return – most likely at the Rome Masters in May – he will do so with his head clear and body rested, which spells bad news for his rivals.Explore more on these topicsJannik SinnerThe ObserverTennisDrugs in sportWadacommentShareReuse this content"

The setback is likely to mean a lengthy lay-off for the Ivory Coast International whose contribution has been signficant of late, scoring six goals in the last 14 games. Manuel Ugarte and Toby Collyer also picked up injuries in training this week, leaving Amorim with scarce options in midfield.Amorim has struggled to turn the ship around and United travel to Tottenham on Sunday, a fixture that started the weekend as 14th v 13th and with a combined total of five wins between them in their past 22 league games.Asked if poor morale among staff at the club was affecting the team, Amorim said: “I think it’s really important for us in the first team, coaches and players, to not ignore that. People are losing their jobs so we have to acknowledge that and the biggest problem is the football, because we spend the money, we are not winning, we are not in Champions League, so the revenues are not the same.“We spent a lot of money in the past and now we have to be careful with the finances. We cannot rebuild the team the way we would like. People are losing their jobs, of course it’s hard to have that feeling of people safe in their job and it affects the environment. We cannot ignore, we acknowledge that problem and I want to say that the responsibility is the first team.“We have to change that. The first part, what we should do is to win at Tottenham. That is the small step to try to help these people, to try not to push the prices of the tickets higher. We are responsible for that.”View image in fullscreenManchester United co-owner Jim Ratcliffe’s new regime has instigated several rounds of redundancies at the club.Photograph: Andrew Couldridge/Action Images/ReutersAfter Ratcliffe’s investment, 250 employees left United in an original round of redundancies last autumn and winter and now the co-owner is seeking to further reduce staffing levels.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The 20-year-oldPatrick Dorgu was the only winter arrival, costing an initial £25.2m. There is an agreement thatUnited will need to sell players before they can invest in new onesthat will fit Amorim’s 3-4-3 formation.The head coach has brought the same strategy that served him well at Sporting, but those he inherited at Old Trafford are yet to thrive in the system. “I think it can be a weakness in the moment,” Amorim said of sticking to his principles. “But then you believe in one thing or another and you have to stick with that. I feel that we focus a lot on the system but the way we want to play the system is completely different than what we are doing at the moment. We are trying to improve.”United have backed Amorim’s methods, showing faith in his carefully constructed philosophy. Time will be required when it comes to an improvement in performance and results as the Portuguese seeks to find a coherent team to play how he wants.Explore more on these topicsManchester UnitedThe ObserverRuben AmorimnewsShareReuse this content"

For 80 minutes it seemed fears of being blunt in attack would be founded in a frustrating stalemate at struggling Leicester but then the excellent Ethan Nwaneri dinked a feathery cross into the box and the substitute Mikel Merino, unmarked between Wout Faes and Woyo Coulibaly six yards out, twisted his head to power in the first of his two goals. Merino, who replaced the ineffective Raheem Sterling, sealed victory with his second with three minutes of normal time to play.Keown apologises to Van Nistelrooy for infamous Old Trafford ‘shenanigans’Read moreArteta began with Leandro Trossard as a false 9, Sterling to his left and Nwaneri to his right in a three-pronged attack but until Merino’s header the Arsenal manager must have been wondering how else to penetrate Leicester, now without a clean sheet in 21 matches in all competitions. This was the firstPremier Leaguegame in which Arsenal began without any of Bukayo Saka, Gabriel Martinelli, Gabriel Jesus or Havertz, who is out for the season with a hamstring injury, for almost four years. But Merino ensured Arsenal cut the gap to Liverpool, the leaders who host Wolves on Sunday, to four points for at least 24 hours.It could, as Arteta acknowledged, have been a different picture had another Arsenal teenager, Myles Lewis-Skelly, not made a magnificent intervention. Eight minutes before Merino’s header, Arsenal surrendered possession on halfway and Jordan Ayew sent a ball rolling invitingly across the face of goal. Bobby De Cordova-Reid was lurking at the back post for a tap-in but the 18-year-old Lewis-Skelly spied the danger and flicked his right boot at the ball to make a goal-saving interception and clear for a corner. It was arguably the moment of the match given how the game was poised at that point. A magic touch, as Arteta put it.View image in fullscreenMikel Merino heads Arsenal’s first goal past Leicester’s Mads Hermansen.Photograph: Chris Radburn/ReutersThe game had been approaching the point where William Saliba, a striker at boyhood club Bondy, where he was coached by Kylian Mbappé’s father, must have thought about piling forward from centre-back. Sterling and Trossard fluffed half-chances. Martin Ødegaard slipped in Nwaneri but, on this occasion, the teenager ran out of road. When Arteta withdrew Sterling, it was down to Merino to operate as a forward. “It’s the first time that I’ve played as a striker,” the Spain midfielder said. “It’s a good day to score because I forgot to give my wife a Valentine’s Day present, so I think she’ll appreciate this more than a rose or some chocolates.”It was inevitable that Nwaneri was involved in Arsenal’s significant first goal. The twinkling 17-year-old was Arsenal’s most dangerous player, full of juice, deft in possession, adept off both feet. Just after the hour the teenager’s shot skimmed the top of the Leicester crossbar and with time ticking he cracked a shot against a post, via the fingertips of Mads Hermansen.“Every sign that he’s given us is: ‘Let me go for it, let me go,’” Arteta said of Nwaneri. “When a player is giving you all those signs, you should not stop it. You have to play with that freedom, with that creativity, with that confidence he’s playing with, and the players believe in him. He’s a massive threat, a massive talent and deserves to play.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The substitute Riccardo Calafiori brought the ball forward and passed the baton to Trossard, who curled a ball towards the far post where Merino did the rest. “He’s a good threat because he can smell danger,” Arteta said.For Ruud van Nistelrooy, it was another agonising brush with Arsenal, though before the match Martin Keown did at least apologise for “the shenanigans that went on back in the day”. On the day Leicester’s supporters staged a series of protests against the board, starting at the Local Hero pub, half a mile from the stadium, a couple of home-reared talents helped Arsenal stay in the hunt at the top. “With everything that happened in the last few days, it was important to show how much we want it, we’re really going to go for it and that we believe in what we have,” Arteta said.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueThe ObserverLeicester CityArsenalmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

For the Egyptian and Manchester City, joy; for the visitors, despair, as they were sent home reeling, on the back of a 16th consecutive Premier League reverse here.At the break, a home fan suggested it was “the best first 45 minutes I’ve seen all season”: he was not far wrong, because when City are performing like this you see how Pep Guardiola might revive his embattled champions.Emergency striker Merino rescues Arsenal with double to sink LeicesterRead moreWith a quarter of an hour left Marmoush had his moment, as the manager removed him and the jubilant home congregation gave him a richly deserved ovation. Of his star act, Guardiola said: “Three goals – we knew it. In Germany he made good numbers. We knew with his dynamism he would do good. Hopefully he can handle the biggest compliments. It’s so simple, when you play well everybody adapts quickly. When you don’t play well you need time.”Nico González was as impressive, doing the type of cleaning up and work City sorely miss due to the absence of Rodri, to whom his manager compared him.“He is like a mini-Rodri, a big compliment,” said Guardiola. “He’s miles away from Rodri – he’s the best – but we have the feeling he’ll help us in the last part of the season with his presence [because] Nico helps a lot, in the 50/50s [or] if there are 10 balls he wins seven. There was a moment he was correcting Erling [Haaland] – when this happens, you think in the next six, seven years and when we have Rodri back that will give us more presence and stability.”The manager was as approving of a Haaland stampede that zigzagged him into Newcastle’s area and required Dan Burn’s sliding tackle to stop a shot. All day, Newcastle could not cut off City’s attacking pipeline, and soon Marmoush had a first effort, unloading after darting along his left flank.The next time he took aim, he scored, a product of a beautiful route-one move: Ederson advanced and flipped a sweet low 50-yard pass; Kieran Trippier, tracking Marmoush’s left-right diagonal, leaped, missed the ball, and as Martin Dubravka rushed out, the forward’s chip bounced and kissed the open net. Ederson’s assist was the sixth of his career in the Premier League– the most for a goalkeeper.View image in fullscreenOmar Marmoush chips Martin Dubravka for his first goal in Manchester City colours.Photograph: Conor Molloy/ProSports/ShutterstockMarmoush’s second goal in City colours soon followed and had a case for being better than the first. As he and other teammates assembled near Newcastle’s area, Ilkay Gündogan tapped to Marmoush. The initial touch knocked the ball to his right, again Trippier was left a patsy, and the finish, coming from an inside-left channel, defeated Dubravka at the tighter, near corner.For a phase Newcastle camped near Ederson’s goal and went close when a City mix-up allowed Alexander Isak to shoot, John Stones’s intervention doing enough to send the ball wobbling wide.Marmoush’s outing rocketed further, and this was City at their ruthless best: Phil Foden passed to Savinho, who glided along the right, beyond Lewis Hall, and turned the ball into the area for City’s No 7 to steer home.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The corner proved a dud but there was hope, perhaps, that Newcastle could do what Feyenoord did here and claw back asecond half 3-0 deficit. But this soon faded as City kept their foot on the jugular.Haaland hunted down Burn as he meandered across his goal and the No 9 set up Savinho. Then, Josko Gvardiol launched a buccaneering run along the left and had Guardiola imploring the faithful to join in with his claps. An entertaining subplot was the Haaland-Burn tussle that now featured the big striker manhandling the even bigger centre-back at a rare Newcastle free-kick that was theirs after the Norwegian, captain for the day, hurled Bruno Guimarães to the turf.Towards the end a Haaland flick was volleyed in by James McAtee to top off City’s day.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueThe ObserverManchester CityNewcastle Unitedmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Brave? Or visionary? The sceptics and gatekeepers certainly had their doubts. But the sight of hundreds of teenage and young girls dancing to Taylor Swift, Rosé and Bruno Mars, and Psy’s Gangnam Style in between races at her brand new event, the Keely Klassic, was quite the riposte.Emma Raducanu takes new wildcard in Dubai in bid to stop losing runRead moreNormally an athletics event in the UK feels a bit like a vicarage tea party. This felt more like being on the Road to Damascus. This observer has certainly never seen a British athletics crowd as young or engaged.What made it even more remarkable still was that Hodgkinson, who was intending to go for the 800m short-track world record, was not competing having injured her hamstring during the week. The races themselves were largely made up of British athletes rather than star names.It helped that organisers had brought in the DJ Tony Perry, who had previously warmed up fans at the 2024 Champions League final and 21 matches during the 2022 World Cup, into the infield.View image in fullscreenKeely Hodgkinson with DJ Tony Perry.Photograph: David Davies/PAIt meant that when the athletes weren’t tearing around the track at the Utilita Arena, there was music and dancing to keep the 4,000 crowd – which was young and largely female – engaged. Hodgkinson and the other athletes also played their part by signing autographs and posing for selfies.“The gold medal has enabled me to put on events like this and to bring a new generation to the sport to enjoy watching it,” said Hodgkinson. “It’s so amazing to hear the stories from little girls and boys who watched me perform in Paris. That’s what really inspires me.”But this was really about the Keely effect in action. When she won gold in Paris she was watched by 9.1 million people in the UK – more than anyone else at the Olympics.It all made the BBC’s decision to relegate the event to the iPlayer even more puzzling – especially as it opted to show reruns ofFlog It!and the filmMr Malcolm’s List, which it had aired as recently as October 2024, instead.The athletics’ record books will show that this was a day where the Olympic bronze medallist Georgia Hunter Bell held off Irish star Sarah Healy to win the women’s 1500m in 4min 0.65sec – while Lina Nielsen and Neil Gourley set British records in the women’s 300m and men’s 1,000m. But the overriding memory was of how different everything was.View image in fullscreenGeorgia Hunter Bell on her way to winning the women’s 1500m during the Keely Klassic at the Utilita Arena, Birmingham.Photograph: David Davies/PA“It felt like a really fun atmosphere,” said Hunter Bell. “When we came out everyone was dancing, so it was a bit different to the usual meet.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The atmosphere was absolutely superb, and we even won prizes for getting our entire row up and dancing.”Perhaps we shouldn’t have been surprised.

Exeter Chiefs found out the hard way as they offered plenty of huff and puff but were ultimately shut down by a more ruthless and efficient team. The visitors needed to win this one and their final game against Leicester Tigers to have any hope of qualifying for the semi-finals. Now they will be spectators when the competition narrows to four.Saracens will be in the mix. They won ugly here, and were mostly on the defensive, but that is the thing with formidable outfits, they simply get the job done. This 21-12 win takes them to second in the table and puts them in the driving seat to secure a home semi-final with a final fixture against basement dwellers Sale Sharks to come. After their shock reverse to Bristol in the playoffs last season, the most successful club in English women’s rugby with three titles will be itching to lift a trophy they have not held since 2022.‘High-energy, risk-taking, intense’ US women’s league shows its rugby colorsRead more“We had a team coming to us who were fighting for their season and we knew they’d keep the ball and throw the kitchen sink at us,” Marlie Packer said. “We knew we’d have to defend. We got the win and sent them back down the M4.”Exeter’s Nancy McGillivray opened the scoring on five minutes when she stepped in from midfield to cut a hole in the line. Saracens, though, kept their patience. Three first-half entries in the red zone resulted in three tries and the game was in effect over at the interval. “We’ve worked on being clinical,” Packer said.First Sophie Bridger scored; a scrum penalty on halfway became a driving maul from a lineout which became five points several phases later. May Campbell notched her 16th try in 14 games thanks to excellent work from Packer who tore down the blindside and popped a perfect pass off her shoulder. Then, three minutes from the break, Poppy Cleall burrowed over with Zoe Harrison slotting her third conversion for a 21-7 lead. Exeter’s job became all the more difficult when Claudia MacDonald was shown a yellow card for illegally slowing down the ball close to her own line.Saracens should have added another after the restart, twice fluffing promising attacks and once being held up over the line. Exeter were just as wasteful and were regularly turned over on the ground inside Saracens’ 22. The Chiefs were incisive off first-phase strike play, and deserve credit for the intricate patterns they put together, but too often they spilled the ball in contact or found themselves in cul-de-sacs. “We’ve got to learn as a team not to panic, that it’s OK not to have the ball,” Packer said. “Sometimes we’re guilty of that. But we’re working on it.”Exeter offered the suggestion of a comeback on the hour when Sabrina Poulin launched a counterattack from a loose kick and teed up MacDonald who raced over in the corner. Packer left the field but not before distracting Liv McGoverne who missed the conversion.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Their substitute forwards kept them in the ascendency and the closing minutes were staged inside Chiefs territory. Harrison is not the most creative 10 in the land, but her ability to control tight games behind a gnarly pack means she is a player for big games.

Levy’s second-class Tottenham Women mired in mediocrityJonathan LiewAmbition for the women’s team – like the men’s – seems based on hanging in there until the big money starts rolling inSat 15 Feb 2025 15.00 ESTShareAcouple of years ago it was reported that Daniel Levy, the man in charge ofTottenham Hotspur, was lobbying to abolish promotion and relegation to and from the Women’s Super League. Levy’s vision was of a steady-state league, with no mobility and therefore no real jeopardy, where the same teams competed for the same stuff every season. How we laughed. As it turned out, he needn’t have gone to the trouble. It pretty much ended up happening anyway.For Tottenham at least, a season that began replete with possibility has buffed down to a blunt point. Marooned in mid-table, eliminated from both cup competitions, safe from relegation and well out of the Champions League race, their last nine games – starting with the north London derby at the Emirates on Sunday – are essentially pure content, dead rubbers, puff football. Will they put in a strong run of results and finish in fifth? Or will they falter and slump to seventh? Tune in to find out!‘Dark day for parks’: Plans to build Spurs academy on London green space approvedRead moreAnd this has pretty much been the story of Spurs in recent years, barring a brief flirtation with relegation in 2022-23: an entire women’s football operation whose success basically turns on whether or not they can finish ahead of Everton. Almost invariably they beat the weaker teams at the bottom. Almost invariably theylose to the big four. Since winning promotion to the WSL in 2019 their record against Arsenal, Chelsea and the two Manchester clubs in all competitions reads: played 54, won two, drawn six, lost 46. All of which raises a salient question: what, really, is the big idea here? What is the growth plan, the blueprint for progress?This is a question that gathers urgency when you examine Tottenham’s systems and processes in more detail. Under Robert Vilahamn, Spurs have sought to play an attractive, high-energy passing style of football that moves the ball quickly up the pitch to create scoring chances. And, you know, who doesn’t love that?In practice, and certainly against the bigger clubs, it works out a little differently. Tottenham pass the ball out from the back. Tottenham get pressed. Tottenham panic wildly. At which point, Tottenham either lose the ball or lump it long. This season Spurs are second in the WSL for touches in their own defensive third and only eighth for touches in the attacking third.And fair enough, this is a defined style. But not really a style that has ever felt sustainable or effective, or threatened to get the best out of the club’s attacking talents. Meanwhile a team that was renowned for being dour but hard to break down under Rehanne Skinner has become the second-leakiest defence in the league.View image in fullscreenNew Spurs signings like Olivia Holdt need a period of adjustment to the Women’s Super League.Photograph: Joe Toth/Tottenham Hotspur FC/ShutterstockNaturally, there are mitigating factors here. The serial injuries to Kit Graham, one of the few players able to take the ball under pressure and progress it with class, have been a major blow. The arrival of Lize Kop in January finally seems to have addressed the chronic lack of a top-class goalkeeper comfortable playing the ball with her feet. New signings such as Olivia Holdt and Anna Csiki still clearly need a period of adjustment to the league. An overreliance on Eveliina Summanen was badly exposed by her injury in January.But perhaps the brutal truth is that for some time now, Tottenham have been trying to play champagne football with Lambrini footballers. An erratic recruitment strategy has swung from spending big on older established stars to signing young players with potential, and still boasts far more misses than hits. Vilahamn’s stated objective is to get Spurs into the Champions League within three years, but if anything the gap to the elite is actually widening.At which point, with regrets, it is necessary to mention the plight of the men’s team, but only because these appear to be common plights with a common root. In a landscape where the biggest clubs are becoming ever more assertive in the transfer market, Levy’s Spurs have remained largely reactive: unwilling to dig deep and invest the sums that might genuinely help them make the leap out of mid-table, unwilling to commit to a defined strategy or identity for more than a couple of years at a time.View image in fullscreenRobert Vilahamn, who recently signed a new contract at Spurs, has the makings of a fine coach.Photograph: Joe Toth/Tottenham Hotspur FC/ShutterstockPeer even closer and the parallels are unmistakable. The made-for-television acquisition of Alex Morgan in 2020 coincides almost perfectly with Levy’s phase of hiring celebrity managers such as José Mourinho and Antonio Conte, straining to project Tottenham as a Proper Big Club. The panic spree of 2022-23 when Bethany England arrived for a record fee and saved Spurs from relegation tracks neatly with the chaos and short-termism of Conte’s final season. Ivan Perisic is basically the male Amy James-Turner. “Abolish relegation” is basically Levy’s bespoke twist on the European Super League.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties. For more information see ourPrivacy Policy. We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionAnd so to the current “Stay Humble” era, in which two appealing progressive coaches try to impose their maximalist ideas with minimalist resources. It should embarrass Levy that the men’s team should have to play a bunch of exhausted teenagers in defence because of inadequate recruitment. It should embarrass him that there are more Arsenal academy graduates than Spurs academy graduates in the women’s first-team squad. That no home-produced player has started in the WSL for them all season.It should embarrass him that when Chloe Morgan left in 2020 she accused Tottenham of treating the women’s team like second-class citizens, that the women were not even allowed to train on the same site as the men until – according to reports – a shocked Alex Morgan had to persuade Levy to let them do so. It should embarrass him that Spurs are so clearly paying the price for those years of undernourishment, and that while Chelsea redraw the lines of the market, they are barely treading water now.But, of course, Levy – like many of his ilk – is basically post-embarrassment, an owner who has confused his longevity and impregnability for a kind of enduring genius. Whose strategy for the women’s team appears to extend no further than simply hanging in there until the really big money starts rolling in. Fifth, seventh: who really cares?There are good people underneath him. Vilahamn – who recently signed a new contract – has the makings of a fine coach. Anew centre of excellencein Enfield, given approval this week over the objections of residents and environmental campaigners, will doubtless start producing the Spurs players of the future. The vision is there. But for now the conviction is absent.“One club” is one of Vilahamn’s favourite phrases. He meets his counterpart Ange Postecoglou on a regular basis. The two teams share backroom staff and facilities and recruitment expertise and a common vision of fast, attacking football. In a way, their fates are yoked together. But a shared blessing can also be a shared curse.Explore more on these topicsTottenham Hotspur WomenSportblogWomen's footballWomen's Super LeagueTottenham HotspurcommentShareReuse this content"

Pyle’s ignorance, arrogance and dangerous scheming, intended to bring peace, result instead in the deaths of many innocents and ultimately his own. In today’s too-real, nonfiction world,Donald Trumpis Pyle. Except he’s The Noisy American.He thinks he’s a great deal-maker. He never stops trumpeting his brilliance. Yet his North Korea “deal of the century” was a fiasco. He handed Afghanistan to the Taliban on a plate. Israel’s Benjamin Netanyahu runs rings around him. Now Trump-Pyle proposes another rubbish deal –selling out Ukraine. America’s very own surrender monkey is Vladimir Putin’s useful idiot. No matter how officials spin it,Trump’s concessions, made before ceasefire talks with Russia even begin, are calamitous, primarily for Ukraine but also for Europe’s security, the transatlantic alliance, and other vulnerable targets, such as Taiwan. As stated,Trump’s giveaways– accepting the loss of sovereign Ukrainian territory to Russian aggression, denying Nato membership to Kyiv, withholding US security guarantees and troops – are shameful appeasement, amounting to betrayal.It was Putin, remember, who launched an unprovoked, murderous full-scale invasion three years ago. But Trump suggests that President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Ukraine’s brave, battered people are somehow to blame. He even regurgitates Kremlin calls forfresh elections in Kyiv. Such hypocritical cant from a regime that routinely subverts other countries’ polls is beyond sickening. But Trump the duplicitous dupe willingly buys it. Putin surely cannot believe his luck. Bychatting chummily on the phonefor 90 minutes, praising Russia’s “genius” tyrant for his “common sense”, and inviting him to a Saudi summit, Trump rehabilitated a pariah and pulled the rug from under Nato allies. Putin gave nothing back. He thinks he’s winning, on the battlefield, politically and diplomatically. He’s right. Worse, Moscow continues to demand that any lasting deal address “structural issues”. These include Ukraine’s disarmament, non-aligned status, the “denazification” of its leadership, and even its existence as an independent state, which Putin abhors. Russia wants to re-order Europe’s security architecture, shorthand for weakening, dividing and pushing back Nato.Pete Hegseth, the US defence secretary and Pyle clone, gave Putin a big assist last week, insisting that European security wasno longer Washington’s “primary focus”. Europe (including Britain) must pay more for its defence – he proposes 5% of GDP – and “provide the overwhelming share of future lethal and nonlethal aid to Ukraine”. US troops in Europe could be cut, he suggested. All this raises a wider question about the transatlantic alliance under Trump’s malign reign. The Americans have shattered Nato’s united front on Ukraine. They have broken their word. They have undermined Zelenskyy and leading supporters – Britain, Germany’s Olaf Scholz, Poland’s Donald Tusk and Kyiv’s allies in the Baltic republics and Scandinavia, all of whom put their trust, wrongly, it transpires, in US leadership.What, then, is Nato for? By prioritising China and the Indo-Pacific over the North Atlantic area – while threatening to emulate Putin and invade sovereign countries such as Canada, Panama and Danish Greenland – Trump undercuts Nato’s raison d’être and shreds the global rulebook it was created to uphold. He previously threatened to quit the alliance. Maybe he should. It could forceEuropeto take charge of its own destiny.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Trump has long viewed European governments, hard-right politicians such as Hungary’s Viktor Orbán excepted, as spongers. He harbours irrational animositytowards the EUand has so far refused to speak to Brussels. His steel tariffs reflect this visceral disdain. So cries of shock and pain from the likes ofKaja Kallas, the EU foreign policy chief, and Britain’s defence secretary,John Healey, who insist they must have a central role in any US-Russia negotiation, come a bit late. They should have taken a tougher public and private stance with Trump from the start, to prevent him going off on a unilateralist tangent. Instead, Europe was, and still is, divided on how best to deal with both Trump and Ukraine, with some leaders, such as Italy’s Giorgia Meloni, currying favour, and others, like Keir Starmer, biting their lip. This is vindication for France’sEmmanuel Macron, who has repeatedly called, largely in vain, for the EU to develop and fund its own collective, non-Nato defence force, arms procurement and manufacturing. That effort must be ramped up immediately.The global ramifications of last week’s watershed American capitulation will be widely felt. China will be emboldened by this spectacular, self-harming rupture inside the western alliance. It’s probably fair to say an invasion of Taiwan, threatened by President Xi Jinping, has moved appreciably closer. Russia’s rogue allies, Iran and North Korea, will also relish western disarray. Is it too late to turn this around? Europe’s claims to be a global player have been torpedoed. America’s reputation as guarantor of peace, security and the UN-charter-based rule of law is shot. It’s a red letter day for the axis of autocrats and authoritarians everywhere. The Trump doctrine has been unveiled: might makes right, the weak go to the wall.All options must remain open. Ukraine and Europe must be directly included in any ceasefire talks. Rowing back rapidly, Hegseth and the US vice-president, JD Vance, now seem toconcede these points. But concerted pressure on Washington by all the western democracies must be maintained to ensure Kyiv survives flaky Trump’s patsy deals and a catastrophic precedent is avoided.If the US-UK so-called special relationship is still worth anything, it is time to cash in. Britain must quietly work behind the scenes until this noisome, noisy American grasps a hard-earned truth: peace at any price is no peace at all.Simon Tisdall is the Observer’s Foreign Affairs CommentatorExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionVladimir PutinUkraineNatoVolodymyr ZelenskyyEuropeForeign policycommentShareReuse this content"

Prominent columnistswroteendless piecesdeclaring that the word “women”had “become verboten”. The thought police, these people claimed, were forcing everyone to say “bodies with vaginas” and “menstruators” instead. Even the likes ofMargaret Atwoodtweeted articles with headlines like: “Why can’t we say ‘woman’ anymore?”That, of course, wascomplete nonsense. While there was certainly a push for more inclusive language, nobody with any influence was trying tobanthe word “women”.Now, however? Now, it’s a very different story. Thanks to Donald Trump’s sweeping executive orders attacking “gender ideology” and DEI programs, the word “women” – along with a number of other terms – is quite literally being erased. Thelikes of Nasa havebeen busy scrubbing mentions of terms related to women in leadership from public websites in an attempt to comply with Trump’s executive orders, for example. Agencies like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have taken down numerous webpages related to gender in the wake of Trump’s orders – although a federal judgedordered on Tuesdaythat they should be reinstated.Meanwhile, the National Science Foundation (NSF) has an internal list of hot-button words (which include “women”, “gender”, “minority”, “biases”) that they are cross-referencing against active research projects and grant applications. TheWashington Post reportsthat once one of these very dangerous words is identified, staff then have to go through a flowchart to see whether a research project should be flagged for further review.The National Institutes ofHealthand multiple university research departments are going through a similar dystopian exercise. Researchers at the University of California at San Diego, for example, have said their work is now at risk if it contains language deemed potentially problematic, including the word “women”.Rebecca Fielding-Miller, a UCSD public health scientist, told KPBS that the list of banned words circling in scientific communities was Orwellian and would hamper important research. “If I can’t say the word ‘women,’ I can’t tell you that an abortion ban is going to hurt women,” Fielding-Miller said.Fielding-Miller also noted that it was illuminating to see which wordshadn’tbeen flagged as problematic. “I guess a word that’s not on here is ‘men’, and I guess a word that I don’t see on here is ‘white’, so I guess we’ll see what’s going on with white men and what they need,”Fielding-Miller added.Amid all the anxiety about what you are allowed to say in this brave new world, a lot of researchers are erring on the side of caution. Some scientistshave saidthat they are considering self-censoring to improve their chances of getting grants. Others are gravitating towards “safe” topics – like, you know, issues that concern white men. This is a dance we’ve seen many times before: Republicans will advance ambiguous, and possibly unconstitutional, legislation. Because no one knows what the hell is going on or how they might get punished for violating these vague new laws, people self-censor and aggressively police themselves.So, I guess this is where we are now: Republicans aren’t justbanning books, they’re policing words. An administration effectively fronted by Elon Musk – a self-proclaimed “free speech absolutist” – is so touchy about the language that we use that scientists are now self-censoring. It’s so prescriptive about what things are called that it’s blocking journalists from events for continuing to refer to theGulf of Mexicoinstead of the Gulf of America. It’s so obsessed with controlling how we think that it’s erasing references to trans people from the website for theStonewall national monument. Under the disingenuous guise of “restoring freedom of speech”, the Trump administration has made clear it is intent on controlling the very words we use.Errol Musk, who impregnated his former stepdaughter, says Elon is a bad dadElon Musk seems to get some of his extreme views about pro-natalism from his father, Errol, who also has multiple children. Errol has even fathered two kids with his former stepdaughter, who was only four years oldwhen he married her mother. I bring this up because Errol is currently in the newscalling Elon a terrible father. He’s certainly not wrong about that – the Tesla billionaire seems to treat his kids like props rather than people – but his statements bring to mind certain adages about pots and kettles as well as glass houses.Investigation launched into human egg trafficking ringThailand and Georgia have said they are investigating a human-trafficking ringaccused of harvesting human eggsfrom Thai women who came to Georgia thinking they’d be surrogates. Instead, they werereportedly held captiveand had their eggs harvested. This story is just the latest example of the way in which the global egg trade has given rise to black markets and abuse. Last year, for example, aBloomberg Businessweek investigationreported that Greek police had identified up to 75 cases of alleged theft of eggs taken from the ovaries of IVF patients at a clinic on Crete.Infant mortality rates rise in US states with abortion bans, study findsJustyour latest reminderthat anti-abortion activists are in no way “pro-life”.Domestic violence study that strangled rats should not have been approved, animal advocates argueThe rats were non-fatally strangledas part of researchthat aimed to improve the detection of brain injury resulting from intimate partner violence.The Syrian feminists who forged a new world in a land of warThe Guardian has afascinating pieceon the autonomous region of Rojava, in north-eastern Syria, which has a government with arguably the most complete gender equality in the world.A pregnant woman in the West Bank was shot by Israeli soldiersSondos Shalabi, 23,was eight months pregnant.

That may still come as a bit of a shock for a nation that, despite everything, has an entrenched habit of considering itself the gold standard.But of course we are not, at least when it comes to prisons. Here are just a few more details from a recent report that compiledtestimonies from officers: rooms flooded with “the smell of urine from rodents”; broken CCTV cameras; floors breaking down into trip hazards; “ongoing legionella issues”; kitchens with no heating for eight years; a jail that has been without hot water since April 2022. Things have got so bad that some prisons are commissioning inmates to do the repairs themselves.Part of the problem is privatised maintenance, which the Prison Officers Association report criticises. In 2015, this was outsourced. A recentNational Audit Office reportfound that a quarter of prison places don’t meet basic fire safety standards, and that the backlog of maintenance works has doubled in the last four years. It has estimated that sorting all this out will cost£2.8bn over five years. But this is not the only reason prisons are in such a state.It all started with a steep increase in the prison population – now far higher than other countries in western Europe. Stiffer maximum sentences, rising prosecutions and swelling numbers of people on remand means that in over three decades the population doubled to 86,000, and is now set to reach100,000 by 2029. Since September, thousands of inmates have been set free early, which has held off a crisis. But only temporarily. By July, critical capacity will probably be reached again.More prisoners has led to overcrowding, as spending on space and officers has not kept up. Inmates are jammed into cells meant for one. When there are too many people in prison, it is harder to manage them, and engage them in activities that lead to rehabilitation. Instead of exercising, studying, working or training, about four in 10 prisoners spend nearly all day locked up, rattling around their cells, bored. Boredom leads to self-harm, drug use and violence. Violence is then exacerbated by the staff shortage, which means it can rapidly get out of control. Between 2020 and 2023, the number of prisoners attacking each othergrew by 57%. Assaults on staff are now higher than at any point before 2015.This exacerbates the problem – it means fewer people want to work in prisons in the first place, and current officers leave. Last week it was reported that one guardgave up his 20-year careerafter being kicked and stamped on by an inmate. There has been a recent exodus of the most seasoned prison officers: in 2017, there were 11,100 guards with more than a decade’s experience. That hasfallen to just 6,681. One in four new recruits leave within a year. A survey suggests that things will get worse still: half of prison officers do not feel safe at work and about 40% plan to leave the service in the next five years.A man jailed for shoplifting pleaded for help in the days leading to his death but was not seen by a mental health clinicianWhen prisons are desperate for recruits, standards go down. Officers now arrive after just a few weeks of training, often done online. And when staff are underprepared or unsuited to the work they are doing, things get grimmer still. A report last week found that four in 10 prisoners who took their own lives in custody weredenied proper healthcare. One man, jailed for shoplifting, pleaded for help and did not eat or sleep in the days leading up to his death, but was not seen by a mental health clinician. Relatives described his treatment as “medieval”.And then there’s a final twist: hellish, violent jails make inmates less fit for the outside world. Reoffending goes up, and yet more people get shovelled into the prison system. The vicious cycle starts again.What’s the solution to all this? The most obvious way to shrink the prison population is to reduce the length of sentences. There is no point giving criminals longer time in jail if they spend it acquiring more violent habits and becoming mentally unwell. But this will be hard for Labour to do. Politicians believe that any signs of being soft on crime will be punished by voters. They are not wrong to be worried – when asked, the public tend to say that sentencing is too lenient.But politicians may underestimate the space for persuasion. It turns out that the view we should be tougher on crime ismainly reserved for violence, and, say, death by dangerous driving. Fewer feel the same about theft, or drug dealing. Giving people more details about sentencing guidelines tends to soften this stance further. Presented with examples and case studies, the public are more inclined to think judgments are not too lenient, after all. We are also keen on the idea of rehabilitation.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The art of persuasion has gone out of fashion in politics, but there is a clear case to be made for shortening some sentences. It could and should be made.One tactic might be to talk about how much we are paying for all this. The average cost of a prison place in 2022-2023 was £52,000. Another would be to highlight the dangers of unrehabilitated prisoners roaming the streets, ready to reoffend. The Netherlands has managed to cut prison numbers dramatically, while keeping crime low. There is just a chance we could do the same.Martha Gill is an Observer columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

But there are more practical and valuable things to achieveSat 15 Feb 2025 11.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 15 Feb 2025 14.46 ESTShareThere’s a moment in the 1967 filmThe Graduatethat has become renowned. At a party thrown by his parents to celebrate his graduation, Benjamin (Dustin Hoffman) is approached by Mr McGuire, an elderly bore who wants to say “just one word” to him: “plastics”. “Exactly how do you mean?”, asks the hapless Ben. “There’s a great future in plastics,” says McGuire. “Think about it.”Listening last week to the spending plans of the techlords who run Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon and Meta leads one to wonder if something analogous might have happened to them on their graduation nights. Except that in their cases, the magic word would have been “AI”.How else could one explain why four companies that reported combined capital expenditure of $246bn in 2024 – up from $151bn in 2023 – nowpropose to spendmore than $320bn this year on AI, a technology for which no business model currently exists that could conceivably provide a reasonable rate of return on such an investment?Why are they doing it? Several reasons come to mind, none of them impressive, and all involving the fantasy of getting to artificial general intelligence (AGI). First off, there’s plain old Fomo – fear of missing out – which leads to a conviction that each can’t risk not being in the game. Then there’s terror that there might be an immense “first-mover advantage” for whoever gets to the mythical goal first, with the winner becoming master of the universe. One AGI to rule them all, and all that.But the most persuasive explanation for the collective madness is the most mundane. It is that tech companies are so obscenely profitable that if they don’t do something risky and exciting with their Everests of spare cash they might – shock, horror! – have to give most of it back to their shareholders. And they would much prefer to cover the countryside with gigantic aluminium sheds – full of Nvidia chips running white-hot, overwhelming electricity grids, lowering water tables and draining reservoirs – than do that.The current lavish spending plans of the American giants suggest that they haven’t yet got the messageUntil the arrival of China’sDeepSeek-R1, the consensus in the industry could be expressed in Margaret Thatcher’s favourite acronym: “Tina” (There is no alternative). There was no alternative route to AI, it seemed, other than brute-force computing. The Chinese model rather undermines that. It suggests that there are other, less resource-intensive, paths to usable AI. The current lavish spending plans of the US giants suggest that they haven’t yet got the message. Or perhaps it’s just the latest variation on the problem first articulated by Upton Sinclair: that it’s difficult to get someone to understand something if their share options depend on them not understanding it.Either way, an interesting fault line has opened up in the field of artificial intelligence. Felix Martin, a perceptive Reuters columnist,sees itas a forthcoming civil war. “On one side,” he writes, “are those who strive for artificial general intelligence (AGI), the point where machines match or surpass human capabilities. Let’s call them AI Cavaliers. Facing them are AI Roundheads who are focused on the more mundane goal of solving specific problems as efficiently as possible. Deciding which side to back in this AI civil war will be a defining decision for investors in the world’s hottest technology.”It’s a colourful metaphor with more than a grain of truth. My favourite Roundhead isDemis Hassabis, the co-founder ofDeepMind, a Nobel laureate and now a big shot in Google (which bought DeepMind for a song in 2014). Although he’s always said that his ambition is to get to AGI, his company’s work in London has had a markedly different trajectory from that of the brute-force-computing crowd in Silicon Valley. It’s been focused on specific types of applications, and on training AI models on very carefully curated datasets.And it’s had some remarkable successes. It built a machine-learning system, for example, that could read retinal scans at very high speed and accurately pick out ones that needed specialised inspection. DeepMind’sAlphaGomodeldefeated Lee Sedol, the champion Go player, in 2016. More importantly, though, itsAlphaFoldmodel solved a major (and formidably difficult) problem in biochemistry – predicting how proteins fold – and then led to a spin-off company that is using the technology for drug discovery. It’s also built a powerful weather forecasting model which seems to outperform traditional physics-based systems, and tons of other interesting stuff. So if there is going to be a civil war in AI, the Roundheads are the side to be on. And there is a great future in AI, at least in London.What I’ve been readingThe end of programming as we know it?Very perceptiveessay about the future of codingby Tim O’Reilly, one of the sharpest observers of the tech industry, on his website.Misunderstanding the social media crisisAninsightful pieceby the redoubtable Henry Farrell on his Substack, Programmable Mutter.

However, the cause of his undoing was nothing as trivial as democratic principles; it illustrates a far more profound question that, sooner or later, we all confront: are you a cat or a dog person?Garnor, we may safely conclude, is not a cat person. He quit following allegations that he rigged up a bird table with a firework device so that it explodedwhen a cat paid a visit. The consequences of this shocking but non-lethal incident, which took place back in 2023, have only now come to a head, but it’s fair to say that, as anti-cat statements go, a remote-detonated IED is at the extreme end of things.Apologists for feline terror will doubtless argue that it wasn’t really anti-cat so much as pro-bird. For it’s estimated that domestic cats account for more than 50m avian deaths each year in the UK.As the dog-lover’s favourite walk is up on the moral high ground, that’s a statistic that could appear decisive in the matter of which species of pet is most deserving of our respect and affection. But before anyone cracks open a celebratory can of Chum, let’s note that one Australian study found thatdog-walking in woodlandled to a 35% reduction in bird diversity.Added to which, there’s also a 5,000-10,000 annual UK death count of sheep (mostly lambs) to be placed in the canine con column. Suddenly that familiar hangdog look, often witnessed when a cut of meat goes missing, makes more sense.It’s a measly number compared with the14m sheep slaughtered each yearby human hand in this country, but then this is not about us. It’s abouttheirrelationship with us.“What relationship?” is the question many dog people might ask of cats. For, make no mistake, you could die in a ditch before your average kitty would give you a second look – unless it’s feeding time. Imperious, capricious, indifferent, oblivious and bored are just some of the adjectives that are closely associated with what we must term the feline mystique.If that sounds harsh, it should be said that these are the very same qualities that many of us look for in our partners in human relationships. Perhaps this is why it is often and wrongly claimed that Sigmund Freud said: “Time spent with cats is never wasted”, as if their enigmatic detachment repaid close behavioural study.In reality he once wrote to a friend: “I, as is well known, do not like cats.”The American cultural critic Adam Gopnik once went so far as to argue that all cats are Republicans and all dogs are DemocratsYes, the father of psychoanalysis was actually a dog person, and dog people appreciate other characteristics such as loyalty, obedience and enthusiasm. Or to put it another way, eager subservience.Philosophically speaking, is it better for an animal to be content in servile compliance or miserable in haughty independence? Which is smarter, the stoic conformist or the high-maintenance rebel?Looked at from a different perspective, dogs aren’t submissive and oppressed but noble and collaborative, and cats aren’t suave and independent but selfish and calculating. The American cultural critic Adam Gopnik once went so far as to argue thatall cats are Republicans and all dogs are Democrats, although that was before the rise of Donald Trump and the triumph of fat cats and top dogs.It’s easy to run through their respective plus points: dogs can help the blind but cats are less needy; you can’t take a cat for a cross-country walk but thenyou don’t have to;dogs greet each new morning as if it were their first, while cats are cool if you just want to have a lie-in.Yet this doesn’t establish exactly why we like one more than the other or what the healthiest preference is.

All those wasted hours of scrolling through videos of daredevil cats living their nine lives and hysterical dogs reuniting with someone they haven’t seen for a decade are, like so much in the digital world, siloed endeavours, reaffirming tastes we already hold.The age-old nature of the subject demands a more primal reckoning. It’s not about whom we love most but whom we dislike most. The critical thing about us is not whether we’re cat or dog people but whether we’re anti-cat or anti-dog people. Our latent antipathies may be more telling than our avowed predilections.Garnor clearly nailed his colours to the bird table, but say what you like about cats, they’re not in the habit of leaving a steaming shoe-ready pile on the pavement. And they don’t go to pieces if you go out for the day. Nor do they bark or bite.Cats can be vicious, especially with other cats (and birds), but around humans they’re, well, pussycats. Whereas who has ever encountered a salivating XL bully straining at the leash, and felt wholly at ease? As the old joke goes, it may be safe but you’re not.And yet, and yet, what has a cat ever done for me? They’re all but giant fur balls during the day, as animated as a scatter cushion. Then at night they’re out screaming like wounded banshees, martyrs to petty territorial battles. They are, let’s face it, squarely among life’s withholders and takers, those incurably precious beings whose idea of giving is tolerating your generosity.That doesn’t mean they should be blown up. I’m not deranged. But when I see our 11-year-old terrier growl at some insouciant moggie strolling along the top of the garden wall, I know in this ancient enmity which side of the fence I’m on.

Let’s opt instead for opennessThey say we don’t like drugs, sex, democracy or DIY. Here’s how gen Z really feelSat 15 Feb 2025 12.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 15 Feb 2025 13.00 ESTShareAfter years of being told that the progressive attitudes of younger generations would “save us” and take us towards a utopian future, we are rapidly learning that the politics of gen Z – today’s 13- to 27-year-olds – are something more fractured, with just as many young people carrying rightwing views as leftwing ones (and, on ­certain issues, even more).This reality has become starker in recent days in the wake of many surveys uncovering “shocking” new findings about gen Z’s political attitudes. AMail on Sundaysurveypublished two weeks ago found that more than two-thirds of the 18- to 27-year-olds questioned supported chemical castration for sex offenders – and just under half supported bringing back the death penalty.A survey from Channel 4 –Gen Z: Trends, Truth and Trust– published a few days earlier found that more than half of gen Zers thought “the UK would be a better place if a strong leader was in charge who does not have to bother with parliament and elections”. A third said the UK would be a better place if the army was in charge.Apoll from theTimesreleased on Monday discovered far less alarming views, such as that most gen Zers aren’t proud to be British and only one in 10 would fight for their country – findings which were framed as shocking toTimesreaders.You might think that this evidence would be met with concern and alarm and calls for urgent intervention debating how best to help and understand these reactionary young people in order to divert them away from such disturbing beliefs. However, the response has instead been the opposite: these young people have been roundly mocked, patronised and described as ­“ahistorical”, “illiterate” and simply “stupid” online and in the media.But how effective is this criticism at changing young people’s minds, if that is indeed the real intention? Recent history has shown that not only is this approach useless but that it can also be dangerous too.Rather than trying to understand and dissuade disenfranchised individuals, commentators speak down to and make fun of themThese commentators are falling into an obvious trap, familiar since 2016, in which ridicule, alienation and scolding (while patting yourself on the back for your moral superiority) have only caused these harmful views to fester and grow. It’s the exact problem with how the left and centre approached the rise of racism and anti-feminism over the last decade.Rather than trying to understand and dissuade disenfranchised individuals, they speak down to and make fun of them – making it easy for hard-right figures, like Andrew Tate and even Donald Trump, to capitalise on their disillusionment.Now, these views aren’t just a fringe movement but squarely in the mainstream (and increasingly the ones in power). It’s naive to think we are not encountering identical circumstances with gen Z and that the same phenomenon won’t occur again if – instead of trying to understand what has pushed them rightward – we merely call them idiots.Gen Z has landed here after suffering dire socioeconomic circumstances. They entered adulthood in a recession just as the guardrails against disinformation began rapidly decreasing and, having come of age during Covid, have not known life without the blaring, misinformed noise of social media. They deserve connection and curiosity, especially from older generations that have not contended with even a shadow of these difficulties.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We need to ask what we can do to keep them with us, to weave them into a community that we who came before them and those who come after them can all share.”For a healthy democracy, and even just for harmonious intergenerational living, there needs to be an active desire to grapple with what has made us each come to the views we hold. It’s understandable why this might feel uncomfortable – after all, many of these opinions are heinous and dehumanising.But these findings are ultimately symptoms of a deeper problem, one that won’t be solved without openness and understanding. This doesn’t require acceptance but a willingness to reach out and help – and not to turn our backs on those in crisis.Sarah Manavis is a US writer and critic living in the UKExplore more on these topicsYoung peopleOpinionSocial trendsOpinion pollscommentShareReuse this content"

He wrote it after returning from the Spanish civil war where he had been horrified by leftist factional fighting. His attempts to get the book published were thwarted by an unwillingness among the establishment to so obviously attack Stalin’s Russia at a time the countries were allies.A response from Jonathan Cape publishers suggested that if the fable were addressed “more generally to dictators and dictatorships at large, then publication would be all right”, but it was too obviously telling the history of post-revolution Russia. Jonathan Cape need not have worried. Watching last week, few in the audience were thinking of Stalin and Trotsky.All must have been thinking about right now and how, little by little, a leader goes from saying, “I am with you” to “I am the chosen one”. How he harnesses minds into paranoia about saboteurs and “enemies of the people”. How he tears up the rules and makes his own. And how power and wealth become ever more controlled by a small group of already powerful people – leaving ordinary people lugging boulders up hills.It may be that after a couple of months of whirlwind actionDonald Trumpwill be content to retire to the golf course, the constitutional guardrails will kick in and things will calm down.

It doesn’t look good for Boxer.Naked anklesView image in fullscreenWhere have all the socks gone?Photograph: waywardcanuck/GuardianWitnessOf all the things that seem to be disappearing from modern life – pubs, libraries, politeness and basic truth – the one most worrying me lately has been… socks. It’s been a cold week. Bitter. With icy blasts gouging the skin. So where have all the socks gone? On draughty station platforms, buffeted bus stops and icy high streets, more and more people are leaving their ankles to brave the cold. There they are wrapped in a bobble hat, quilted jacket and scarf – but with a gaping gap between where their trousers end and their trainers begin. Any socks that are on show are those silly ones that don’t quite hit the ankle bone. It’s all too much. Or certainly not enough for this time of year.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Adrián had been out with his father, Dell, in the Strait of Magellan, Chile, when a humpback surfaced and snapped up the kayak.Jonah famously survived three days inside the whale before being spat out; for Adrián it was just moments. Apparently the humpback can only swallow objects no bigger than a watermelon. Adrián’s greatest risk would have been asphyxiation inside the whale’s mouth, which has no breathable air.

By amending the “good character” guidance for immigration staff processing asylum applications, ministers have effectively removed the right of refugees to apply for British citizenship if they arrived in the UK illegally or via a dangerous route, such as in a small boat or stowed away in a lorry.This cruel change means that refugees fleeing conflict, torture and human rights abuses, and who have long been granted protection and the right to live and work in the UK, will no longer be able to become British citizens. There is no justification for it. Although the government has said that the home secretary retains the discretion to grant citizenshipon an exceptional basis, that is likely to be highly unusual. While immigration caseworkers have the discretion to disregard illegal entry for refugees who arrived in the UK as children, there is far from any guarantee that this will happen, and, given the high citizenship application fee, this measure will ensure that even child refugees are penalised as adults for their method of arrival. The immigration lawyer Colin Yeo has said these changes amount to acontravention of the 1951 Refugee Convention, to which Britain was a founding signatory.It is a worrying signal that there is more continuity between the punitive refugee policy of the Labour government and its Conservative predecessor than might have first appeared. One of Keir Starmer’s earliest actions in government was toscrap Conservative policiesthat detained anyone arriving in the UK through irregular means and prevented them from applying for asylum, with the intention that a small fraction would be deported to Rwanda, where their claims for asylum would have been heard and potentially granted by the Rwandan government. This effectively restored the rights of refugees to apply for asylum regardless of their means of arrival, in line with international law.This latest policy – not even debated by MPs prior to its introduction – is a step in the opposite direction, presumably designed to make the government look tough on refugees through undermining Britain’s international obligations. The government undoubtedly hopes that removing the right to ultimately seek citizenship in this way may deter desperate people from attempting the dangerous Channel crossing. But in recent years thenumber of deaths in the Channelhas risen even as ministers have tried to make Britain a more hostile place for asylum seekers.The truth is that, in a world where conflict and abject poverty act as strong push factors to increase the irregular movement of people across borders, the number of people making the Channel crossing is largely out of the government’s control. To the extent that it can influence these flows, enforcement to crack down on the human traffickers charging individuals thousands of pounds for dangerous journeys needs to be accompanied by the establishment of safe and legal routes that enable those who are in mortal peril to apply for asylum in the UK and other safe countries.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But there are serious political risks. Aplurality of the publicsupports all refugees being able to apply for citizenship regardless of how they arrived in the UK; for those who voted Labour last year, it is 62%. In trying to appeal to Reform voters, there is a danger that Labour repels voters who might next time decide to vote Lib Dem or Green.In misleading the public by suggesting that reducing the number of people arriving on small boats to claim asylum is within the gift of politicians, Starmer risks building further support for Reform in the medium term if he cannot deliver on his pledge to “smash the gangs” and bring down the number of small boat crossings. He would do better to have an honest conversation with the public about the fact that we live in an unstable world where the irregular movement of people is likely to increase, and that reducing this requires a long-term strategy involving not just deterrence but strategies to reduce conflict, poverty and climate change, alongside the provision of more safe and legal routes to the west. This would undoubtedly take bravery and leadership. Ultimately, however, it is both the morally correct and the politically wise thing to do.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

We must accept it and begin planningGaia VinceAs wildfires, floods, droughts and record-breaking temperatures have shown, the post-climate change era has arrived. Now we need honesty and action from our leadersSat 15 Feb 2025 10.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 15 Feb 2025 14.43 ESTShareNot yet a quarter of the way into this century and global average temperatures are already 1.75C above the preindustrial average.January 2025 was the hottest on recordand has also set a record for the highest yearly minimum global surface temperature, and likely the highest minimum in the past 120,000 years. It is part of a clear pattern.Last year’s global average was 1.6C above the preindustrial– a sobering reality check, given that, only three months ago at the UN Cop29 summit in Baku, Azerbaijan, leaders were still declaring that limiting global temperature rises to 1.5C was within reach.We are firmly in the post-climate change world now, and the serious implications of this demand honest acknowledgment. The reality is that we are living now in a time of continual disasters that are unfolding alongside our slower, planetary scale disaster. In this riskier time, we need to prepare.The hottest January began with scenes literally from Hollywood ofraging wildfires engulfingsome of the world’s most valuable property, in Los Angeles, in one of the world’s richest countries. Among the apocalyptic images of devastation filling our screens were tens of thousands of dazed citizens forced to evacuate, some of them our planet’s wealthiest climate refugees.As the 200,000 Los Angeles residents return home, tough decisions will have to be made in this new disaster-prone time about where to rebuild and which places should be abandoned in the retreat from risk. It is clear that we will need better protection, sometimes by adapting buildings, but also that some places will no longer be able to sustain larger populations.View image in fullscreenRain-damaged crops near Fakenham, Norfolk, in 2023.Photograph: David Goddard/Getty ImagesIt is a plight faced more invisibly by millions of other climate-displaced people around the world, from the Philippines to Somerset, from Kenya toSpain. In poorer places, when forced to flee unlivable homes, people can end up imprisoned. Take theDadaab refugee camp, located in what is now desert in Kenya. It is home to more than 300,000 trapped refugees, the majority of whom are Somali women and children fleeing chronic drought and starvation, as well as devastating floods. The ongoing conflicts in the region are only exacerbated by these extreme conditions, all of which make the Horn of Africa increasingly unlivable.Poor people living in equatorial deserts are first and worst hit. But our planet is now more dangerous for humans wherever they live. Fires, floods, heat and droughts are killing and injuring people, property and infrastructure. The social and psychological toll is devastating for communities that are affected. And so, too, are the economic costs. Insurance is already unaffordable – unavailable, even – in riskier places, which drives up other costs, changes the face of a neighbourhood and exacerbates other inequalities. We all need to consider climate risk when choosing our home, business or holiday.How the climate crisis threatens the Panama Canal – and the country’s futureRead moreThe impact of natural disasters can easily be international. For instance, the prolonged drought that has affected the Panama Canal over the past two years pushed up shipping costs and delayed global trade at a time when alternative sea routes were constrained.Agricultural disasters can be devastating both locally and globally. I have met relatives of drought-hit farmers pushed to suicide and others forced to migrate across borders. I have heard from flood-hitBritish farmers who lost entire harvestsand were left saddled with debt. The impact on food prices can be widespread. Food inflation in the UK rose to 19.1% in 2023, significantly adding to the cost of living and pushing some on the poverty line into malnutrition. The price of orange juice more than doubled after Florida’s citrus belt was hit by hurricanes at the end of last year; olive oil soared in price after heat and drought hit olive trees, making itthe most shoplifted item in Spain.Disasters impoverish people and they are costly for nations, especially when multiple disasters hit the same country. Last year, Brazil suffered catastrophicfloods across its southern statesthat displaced more than half a million people. The same year, prolonged drought and heat triggered devastating fires across the Amazon and Pantanal region. Often, one disaster cascades into others, such as when Pakistan was hit by unbearable heat and drought in 2022, before violently destructive flash floods displaced 33 million people in a week, only to be followed by landslides that destroyed key infrastructure.Technological resilience must be combined with social resilience, and that comes from investing in societyIn this post-global heating era, we can expect more severe and frequent extreme events. Disasters will affect you and the people you care about over the coming decades. We must accept and factor this new reality into our plans.Adaptation means changing the language we use and adjusting our expectations and strategies. It requires honesty from our leaders. It is no longer acceptable to talk about global heating as if it is a future possibility that can be avoided. People are dying and having their lives destroyed today; we need a much more practical response.Planning homes in high-risk flood zonesis climate denial. And what about those already living at risk?Adaptive planning can make a huge difference. The Netherlands is highly adapted for flood risk – they have been doing it for centuries. This includes sacrificing land as “room for the river” and the incredible Maeslant storm barrier, a marvel of engineering that protects vulnerable areas including Rotterdam. Storm Pía, which caused substantial damage in Germany, Switzerland and Belgium in December 2023, left the well-protected Dutch unscathed.View image in fullscreenPatricia Pescarolo holds her son Gael inside their flooded home in São Paulo, Brazil, earlier this month.Photograph: André Penner/APDisasters will stretch nations and most,including the UK, are not spending anywhere near enough on preparedness. Civil protection organisations now need to respond to multiple disasters in the same country as well as helping their neighbours and sometimes spanning continents. For instance, Australia relies on using loaned air tankers from North America to help quench its summer bushfires during the northern hemisphere winter. But the LA fires occurred in January, while Victoria was also battling extreme flames. Now that fires are occurring year-round on both continents, this is problematic and Australia, the US and Canada will need to raise their capabilities.Adaptive protection doesn’t have to mean vast engineering works. I have visited villages in disaster-prone Bangladesh where people flexibly change jobs during high water, buildings are made safer and, crucially, everyone knows what to do when the warning sounds. Disaster preparedness means that over recent decades,deaths from cyclones in the Bay of Bengal have plummeted, even though cyclones have increased in severity and frequency over the period.Your life is under threat. You might have to run any second. What do you take?Read moreDo you have a plan for if your home flooded? Would you even get an alert? Where would you stay and what would you take with you if flames overtook your building or you were evacuated from your holiday resort? Living in this new reality means being prepared, from compiling an emergency “go bag” to getting aflood sensor.Technological resilience must be combined with social resilience, and that comes from investing in society. Change is unsettling, especially when you haven’t chosen or planned for it, but the relationships you have, the networks you build, allow stronger parts to compensate for weaker – they are what will support us when we are hit by disaster. Ensuring that communities are supported with reliable services, that young people feel purpose and hope for their futures, are central to this.Wherever you live, conditions are changing and people are feeling the impact of extreme weather physically, financially or socially. We are all refugees from a gentler climate but some of us have been able to stay in our homes. Our new world is being built on the shakiest foundations, but with honesty from leaders about our climate reality we can all learn to live with uncertainty.

Inverto said a long-term trend towards more extreme weather events would continue to hit regional crop yields, causing price spikes.The highest price rises were forcocoaand coffee, up 163% and 103% respectively, due to a combination of higher than average rainfall and temperatures in producing regions, according to the research.Arabica coffee pricesSunflower oil prices increased by 56% after drought caused poor crop yields in Bulgaria and Ukraine, which also continued to be affected by the Russian invasion. Other food commodities with sharp year-on-year price rises included orange juice and butter, both up by more than a third, and beef, up by just over a quarter.“Food manufacturers and retailers should diversify their supply chains and sourcing strategies to reduce over-reliance on any one region affected by crop failures,” Katharina Erfort, of Inverto, said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Until greenhouse gas emissions are actually reduced to net zero, heat and drought extremes will continue to intensify across the world, causing greater problems for agriculture and food prices than those we are currently facing.”Explore more on these topicsFoodFood & drink industryGlobal economyClimate crisisExtreme weatherEconomicsnewsShareReuse this content"

In some regions, polar bears areshowing signs of declining physical condition, having fewer cubs, and dying younger.Despite their endangered status, polar bears are hunted commercially in Canada, the only country that still allows the practice after it was banned by Russia, Greenland, the US and Norway. Anannual average of 300–400 skinsare exported, primarily to China, where a full pelt sells for an average of $60,000 (£48,000) and is often used for luxury clothing or as a rug.Trophy hunting: can killing and conservation go hand in hand? - podcastRead moreIt is estimated that there are between22,000 and 31,000 polar bears left in Canada, meaning the trade accounts for the deaths of 1-2% of the country’s polar bear population every year.A two-year investigation has found that WWF has helped facilitate theinternational commercial trade in polar bear fursas part of its support for the policy ofsustainable utilisation. The idea is that by licensing the exploitation of a small number of animals for economic purposes – such as for fur or trophy-hunting – the status of the species overall will be improved.WWF has made clear statements about its position regardingtrophy-huntingand the trade inelephant ivory.It has saidit is “not opposed to hunting programmes that present no threat to the survival of threatened species and, where such species are involved, are part of a demonstrated conservation and management strategy that is scientifically based, properly managed, and strictly enforced, with revenues and benefits going back into conservation and local communities”.At the Convention of the International Trade in Endangered Species (Cites), the global organisation that regulates the trade in endangered species, WWF haslobbied consistentlyfor the continuation of the commercial Canadian polar bear fur trade. In its position statement, it acknowledged there may be a significant decline in the polar bear population in the coming decades, but said trade “is not a significant threat to the species [though there are a] number of polar bear populations in Canada where harvest may be unsustainable”.WWF lobbied against granting full protection to polar bears in2010and2013at Cites meetings when the US, supported by Russia, proposed a ban on the international commercial trade of polar bear skins.Both timesWWF recommendedthat parties should not vote for a full ban, arguing that polar bears had not yet met the criteria for this.This view persists. When asked at the Cites meeting in Panama in 2022 whether WWF would recommend better protection in the forthcoming decade, Colman O’Criodain, WWF International’s policy manager for wildlife and adviser to WWF’sArcticprogramme, said he “[did not] think so in terms of the numeric criteria”.WWF said in a 2013 statement:“If, at some stage in the future, polar bear populations become so diminished by climate change and habitat loss, and/or if international trade presents a greater threat, we would want to revisit the Cites listing issue. But we’re not at that point.”WWFhas also claimeda ban on the international commercial trade would damage the livelihoods of Indigenous communities.However, this is contentious. Robert Thompson, an Iñupiat resident and polar bear guide fromKaktovik, Alaska, said: “We didn’t sell these animals for 10,000 years and that’s why they are still here – we didn’t have a commercial need.”Thompson said a better income could be made without killing polar bears. “There can be a good income by taking people to view the animals – and that is sustainable,” he said. “I think if we just shot the bears to have money, pretty soon we wouldn’t have any more bears and then that’s the end of it.”Atboth Cites meetingstheproposal failedto reach the two-thirds majority required for a ban on the trade.Jean-Paul Jeanrenaud, a former director of WWF who worked for the charity for 27 years, said: “The WWF name, certainly from my experience, had a lot of leverage. If I approached people, they wanted to hear what I had to say … WWF has an influence, and it still has an influence.“I think the public will be even more than surprised, perhaps shocked. I know that it’s the sort of thing that I have difficulty getting my head around.”WWF has also lobbied against granting full protection under Cites to other animals including elephants, hippos, giraffes and rhinos. This was particularly evident at the 2022 Cites meeting, where WWFlobbied successfullyfor changing the listing of Namibia’s white rhino population from full protection under appendix I to the less restrictive appendix II.The majority of wildlife protection organisations do not support WWF’s position, and at the past four Cites meetings acoalition of about 80 NGOsopposed WWF’s recommendations.WWF told the Guardian that an appendix I listing of polar bears would not have prevented trophy hunting. “Under appendix II … commercial trade, in skins for example, is also allowed and the Inuit in Canada avail of this. For this reason, on both occasions when the appendix I listing was proposed, Inuit representatives spoke passionately against it. Rejection of the proposal was also recommended by the International Union forConservationof Nature, [the NGO] Traffic, the Pew Environment Group and the Cites secretariat.”The spokesperson said that after the 2013 debate the Cites committee had looked at the sustainability of the trade: “Canada submitted its case to the following meeting in 2015 and the committee concluded, by consensus, that the trade was sustainable.”Explore more on these topicsWWFEndangered speciesHuntingConservationAnimalsWildlifeArcticnewsShareReuse this content"

Their talks came after Lord Foulkes said recently that he had beenrefused permission to table a question­proposing a ­public register of royal interests. He has called for greater scrutiny of the royals, including in parliament.Parliament’s standing orders and Erskine May, the “bible” of procedure, prevent scrutiny at Westminster of the conduct of members of the royal family. Erskine May states: “No question can be put which brings the name of the sovereign or the influence of the crown directly before parliament, or which casts reflections upon the sovereign or the royal family.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Lord Gardiner does not appear to have gone that far but has helped Foulkes navigate the restrictions, which also include the requirement that parliamentary questions should relate to matters of government responsibility.Foulkes has asked ministers to publish details of any briefings provided to the Duke of York by the Ministry of Defence after he left the Royal Navy and during his tenure as the UK’s special representative for international trade and investment from 2001 until 2011. Foulkes has asked for details on the nature of the briefings, when they ceased and the reasons for their continuation post-service.“There are some suggestions he may have had sensitive briefings and then used the information while talking to other people,” Foulkes said.Prince Andrew’s ‘opaque’ finances provoke calls for register of royal interestsRead moreHe has also tabled a question asking the government to publish annual figures for the cost of royal security and plans further questions about the use of taxpayers’ money by the royal family.Foulkes, who is awaiting written replies from ministers, said there has been less scrutiny and debate in parliament about the cost of the royals since thecivil list was replaced in 2012 by the sovereign grant, which is automatically benchmarked to the equivalent of 12% of the profits of the crown estate, an independent business that hands all its profits to the Treasury.In the Commons, there has been no opportunity for MPs to discuss concerns about the duke’s activities. MPs have proved unable or unwilling to circumvent Erskine May, and the Commons public accounts committee chaired by the Conservative MP Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown has not made investigating the duke’s taxpayer-funded activities a priority.Explore more on these topicsPrince AndrewThe ObserverMonarchyHouse of LordsCrown estatePublic financenewsShareReuse this content"

Vance said he had been charged with the “heinous crime of standing 50 metres from an abortion clinic and silently praying for three minutes, not obstructing anyone, not interacting with anyone, just silently praying on his own”.Smith-Connor, who is receivinglegal support from Alliance Defending Freedom International, a conservative Christian legal advocacy group in the US, was convicted of breaching a safe zone in October last year after refusing repeated requests to move away from outside an abortion clinic in Bournemouth in November 2022.A community officer spoke to him for an hour and 40 minutes and asked him to leave, but he refused. Smith-Connor was handed a two-year conditional discharge and ordered to pay more than £9,000 costs after the case brought by Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole council.Vance also claimed the Scottish government had distributed letters to citizens whose houses lay “within so-called safe access zones, warning them that even private prayer within their own homes may amount to breaking the law”. Shortly after his statement, a Scottish government spokesperson said: “The vice-president’s claim is incorrect. Private prayer at home is not prohibited within safe access zones and no letter has ever suggested it was.”TheAbortion Services (Safe Access Zones) (Scotland) Act, introduced last year, banned “silent prayer” to prevent mass silent vigils that have been used by large groups of US pro-life protesterssuch as 40 Days for Life. The law states that the actions are only banned if they are likely to cause alarm or distress to someone accessing abortion services.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

She said: “He is one of the most powerful people in the world but he is peddling total nonsense and dangerous scaremongering.”The managing director for theAbortionSupport Network, Camille Kumar, accused him of “dog-whistle messaging” and an attack on “fragile” women’s rights. “It is deeply concerning that within days of pardoning [protesters] in the US for their harassment of women and pregnant people outside abortion clinics, JD Vance is now trying to stir up anti-abortion rhetoric in the UK.”The director of the End Violence, Andrea Simon, said: “Safe access buffer zones were introduced to ensure that women can safely access abortion services without fear of harassment.

Britain exports about 209,000 tonnes of steel to the US every year and imports about 16,000, making it the second-biggest export market after the EU.“It is in neither of our interests to have these tariffs,” said Reynolds, who said he remains optimistic that talks with US officials could lead to a resolution before serious damage is done.The director general of industry body UK Steel, Gareth Stace, said last week that the US action wouldstifle UK exportsand damage Britain’s balance of trade at a time when global protectionism was on the rise.“The US is our second-largest export market after the EU, and this move threatens more than £400m of steel exports [each year],” Stace said.View image in fullscreenA £500m investment has been set aside the fund new steel production at Port Talbot in south Wales.Photograph: Andrew Ray/AlamyIn its election manifesto, the then Labour opposition announced plans to spend £2.5bn in order to “rebuild the UK steel industry”. The money would sit alongside aseparate £500m packagefor Tata Steel to part-fund new steel production at Port Talbot in south Wales.Now ministers intend to turbocharge decisions on how that money can best be used to strengthen the steel industry, with the emphasis being on government co-financing of innovative projects led by the private sector. Part of the aim is to ensure that a severely weakened UK steel industry is healthy enough to act as primary supplier in key infrastructure projects in this country that lie at the heart of the government’s drive for growth.Last week, Heathrow delivered welcome news to British Steel, and the industry nationwide, bypledging to use UK-made steelin its largest-ever investment programme, and indicated it would also do so if and when the controversial proposal for a third runway gets the official go-ahead.Heathrow’s plans that would use UK steel include the main new terminal’s infrastructure, with investment in the capacity of Terminal 2 and Terminal 5.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

She died at the age of 68 from chordomaThe ObserverCancer researchBritish professor makes ‘thrilling’ breakthrough for cancer that killed his motherPaul Workman has researched untreatable chordoma for years. Now new technology points towards to a potential drug to beat itRobin McKieScience editorSat 15 Feb 2025 09.04 ESTLast modified on Sat 15 Feb 2025 10.13 ESTShareProfessor Paul Workman was 37 and already well established as a medical researcher when his mother, Ena, died of a rare bone cancer known as chordoma. About one in a million people are affected by the condition, which is untreatable.“It was utterly frustrating,” said Workman, who later became head of the Centre forCancerDrug Discovery and then chief executive of the Institute of Cancer Research, London. “Thirty-six years ago, there was little we could do to treat chordoma. There was little understanding of the disease and no drugs were available to help my mother.”That grim state of affairs could soon be about to change, however. Workman and his colleagues, working as part of an international collaboration, recently pinpointed a key protein, known as brachyury, which they realised was crucial to the survival of chordoma cancer cells in a patient’s body.The discovery caused great excitement among researchers because it suggested a route for attacking chordoma: block the protein brachyury and this would damage the cancer cells whose growth it was promoting. All that was needed was a drug that could effectively attack the protein.View image in fullscreenPaul Workman: ‘We will use the body’s own defences to deal with brachyury.’The problem was the complex makeup of brachyury, which was considered to be drug-proof. However, in apaper published inNature Communicationslast week, Workman – with colleagues in Oxford and North Carolina – revealed that, after studying brachyury in unsurpassed detail, they had pinpointed several sites on its surface which could be used as targets for specially designed drugs.This breakthrough was achieved by using one of the world’s most powerful generators of X-rays: theDiamond Light Sourcesynchrotron in Didcot, Oxfordshire.As a result of this work, Workman’s team has already been able to isolate several promising compounds that are now being used to create potential treatments that could attack brachyury and destroy the protein. In this way, doctors may soon be able to tackle chordoma, a condition that has until now resisted efforts to combat its growth and spread.“It is thrilling to realise that I am now helping to do something about a disease that killed my mother. It has taken considerable effort by a lot of scientists from centres on both sides of the Atlantic but it has been worth it,” said Workman.Crucially, the techniques now being developed to tackle brachyury and chordoma have wider potential and could be used to improve treatments for other, more common, cancers, added Workman. “For a start, brachyury appears to be involved in the metastatic spread of other tumours, which means that drugs that block its activities could also help to obstruct the spread of other cancers,” he added.Workman is the only child of John and Thomasina (Ena) Workman. His father worked in the steel industry, while his mother was active in various community projects in their home town, Workington, in Cumbria. “My father died first, of bowel cancer, many years before my mother succumbed to chordoma,” he said.Ena Workman’s diagnosis was complicated by the fact that she had suffered severe back pain for much of her life: this could have led to her diagnosis – in which chordoma began as a tumour at the base of her spine – being missed in its early stages.View image in fullscreenThe Diamond Light Source in Didcot.Photograph: Nigel Francis/Alamy“Brachyury plays a role in the embryo in promoting the notochord, a precursor of the spine,” said Workman. “Then it is switched off after birth. However, in a very few cases it reappears, and when it does it can trigger chordoma, as was the case with my mother.”Workman himself has not evaded the cancer diagnoses that affected his mother and father: in 2022, doctors told him he had prostate cancer.“It helped that my cancer was localised, small volume, of intermediate risk and likely to have a favourable outcome. I’m well aware that many others have much more difficult news to take in,” said Workman, who was successfully treated with radiotherapy.As for the types of drugs that might one day be used to treat chordoma, Workman says most hopes lie with a system called targeted protein degradation or TPD. This involves a process of co-opting a cell’s natural disposal system to remove the offending protein.Matt Forde: ‘Football is medication. For an hour and a half you forget you’ve got cancer’Read more“One part of the drug will bind to the target protein, while the other part engages directly with cells’ waste disposal systems, which then degrades and flushes everything out of the cell,” said Workman. “We will use the body’s own defences to deal with brachyury.”This progress towards the development of drugs to tackle chordoma has taken years and involved a host of different advanced technologies. Apart from the Diamond Light Source and the use of TPD techniques, a process known as crystallographic fragment screening played a crucial role in highlighting sites where drugs could best latch on to the brachyury protein. “It has allowed us to develop the best-fitting drugs that can fasten on to the protein’s surface,” Workman said.However, Workman stressed that more research was still needed to perfect a drug that would be effective in treating chordoma. “We need to begin trials in chordoma cell lines first and then in chordoma models in animals before we start trials in humans. That could take five years to complete. Then, hopefully, we will finally be ready to tackle the challenge of chordoma.”Explore more on these topicsCancer researchThe ObserverCancerHealthMedical researchfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Most people regain their sense of smell as their infection fades, but some never recover. It means not being able to tell if milk is off, if there’s a gas leak or what your newborn baby smells like.But for victims of anosmia and its crueller sibling, parosmia, where ordinary smells are transformed into the stench ofrotting flesh or sewage, there is new hope. Researchers have discovered that a simple procedure can help people recover their sense of smell years after losing it to viral infections such as Covid, or even decades later.The first patient in the UK began receiving treatment this month and doctors hope the process could be easily rolled out across the NHS.Chrissi Kelly is the first patient in the UK to receive the treatment, which consists of injections of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) from her own blood,prepared by using a centrifuge to separate the platelets from red and white blood cells.“It’s amazing to be able to say ‘there’s a treatment’, because for years that was just off the table,” Kelly said. “And it’s thrilling to be asked to be the first one to receive it.”View image in fullscreenResearch has suggested the sense of smell can be regained by inhaling coffee.Photograph: Viktor Fischer/AlamyKelly lost her sense of smell after developing sinusitis in 2012, and describes anosmia as “like a bereavement”. After three months she began to hallucinate smells, a condition known as phantosmia, then developed parosmia.The only help she could find was research that suggested she could retrain her sense by inhaling known smells such as coffee and lavender. The condition was so little known that Kelly decided to set up a charity,AbScent, to offer support to other sufferers and make other smell-training kits.The Covid pandemic changed everything, with millions of people around the world losing their sense of smell, including Katherine Ryan, the comedian, who said the disorder made her feel “helpless”. AbScent went from 1,500 members in its support group to 95,000 at the same time as its income from the smell-training kits disappeared when cheaper competitors emerged. She closed the charity last year.View image in fullscreenChrissi Kelly at home in London after receiving the first stage of her PRP (platelet-rich plasma) treatment to cure her loss of smell following a virus in 2012.Photograph: Antonio Olmos/The ObserverBut the pandemic also sparked a new wave of research. Prof Zara Patel, director of endoscopic skull base surgery at Stanford University, had been examining anosmia for some time and spotted a neurology paper that suggested PRP might help regenerate nerves.This is important because of the reason Covid affects smell – the SARS-CoV-2 virus binds to cells around the olfactory nerve at the top of the nose.“The way that the olfactory system and olfactory nerve works is unique in all the other cranial nerves,” Patel told theObserver. “None of the other cranial nerves have the ability to regenerate, but the olfactory nerve does.”So if PRP could help the olfactory nerve regenerate, it might relieve anosmia. Patel set up a series of randomised control trials – easier to recruit after Covid – and found that PRP worked better than a placebo after three months and the effect was greater after 12 months. In one case, a 73-year-old man recovered his smell45 yearsafter losing it.Patel’s work impressed Prof Claire Hopkins, a former president of the British Rhinological Society and professor of rhinology at King’s College London who practises at Guy’s hospital in London. She was one of the first people to identify a link between Covid and anosmia and had been investigating other treatments such as steroids.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The risks are small, so I think it is something I can now offer. I will look to try to set this up within the NHS. PRP is used within the NHS for other things, so I’m hopeful we will be able to offer it.”Because PRP is made with centrifuges that are already being used in hospitals, and uses a patient’s own blood, there are fewer regulatory hurdles than other medical procedures. Hopkins and other ear, nose and throat teams need to get approval for the procedure from their hospital boards.Kelly needs to have two further PRP injections over the next three months to complete the treatment. She is cautious about whether she can already sense any effects.“I’m probably the most acute observer of my own sense of smell,” she said, referring to her years of smell training. “I still can’t eat onions. I’m great with coffee, but there are other things like roasted meat I really don’t enjoy as much as I used to.“When I step out of the house in the morning, I will recognise that I’m getting some kind of feedback on what the time of year is and that sort of thing. It’s not always easy for me to say I smell something specific, but I’m always aware of that.“And the other day, I stepped out of my house, and I’m thinking to myself, ‘Oh gosh, that smells good.’ And before I turned around, I thought to myself, ‘That smells like winter-flowering jasmine.’ And it was.”Explore more on these topicsMedical researchThe ObserverLong CovidCoronavirusInfectious diseasesHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

But, according to a series of health inspections, they have needed to clean up their acts in more ways than one.Instances of mouse-nibbled snacks, repeated discoveries of their droppings, mouldy veg and other serious hygiene issues have been raised in recent years in inspections of canteens, cafes andrestaurants across Westminster, theObservercan reveal. In one case, the inspector warned that eating in one government department’s canteen posed “an imminent risk of injury to health”.An 2022 inspection of aMinistry of Defencerestaurant at Ripley Buildings, Whitehall, led to a food hygiene rating of just one out of five. “Our inspection revealed a serious widespread mice infestation and poor maintenance of routine cleaning resulting in a significant risk of food contamination,” an inspector wrote.The inspector went on to serve a hygiene emergency prohibition notice, a legal order stopping the use of one of its dry food stores because of a risk to public health. It found that chocolate bars and a bag of bread crumbs had been gnawed by mice.A 2022 report inspecting a series of facilities at theHouse of Commonsawarded two out of five stars. It detailed that there were “ongoing issues with pests in the House of Commons”, with mouse droppings in 14 locations, including under a food preparation area, in a washing-up area, where chopping boards are stored, and next to fridges.“I was informed that staff had thoroughly cleaned the kitchens on Friday before my visit and therefore I was disappointed to find mice droppings in several kitchens and in clear view,” the inspector noted.A separate 2022 report, looking at a different group of House of Commons outlets, also scored them as two out of five and documented another series of mouse-related issues. It also found “a build-up of food debris on the underside of the blade” on the meat slicer in one kitchen.A report of the same facilities in 2023 demanded “immediate” action on some issues. “A member of staff in the pastry section was seen placing containers of food directly on the floor, then returning them to the fridge,” it noted. Another Commons outlet had given vacuum-packed food a shelf-life of one month, when it should have had a shelf life of just six days.The Ministry of Justice did not escape, with a 2022 report noting “potatoes with mould in the kitchen” of the staff restaurant. Meanwhile, at the Foreign Office, a 2022 inspection found “courgettes with mould in the cold room” and criticised “old mouse droppings in the premises” and “lapses in cleaning”. Out-of-date food was found at the department for international trade in 2023.Even those serving peers of the realm were not immune from criticism. A 2020 report on House of Lords facilities warned that there was a legal requirement to take action because of “food waste and dirt noted on the floor area”. All the inspections were revealed to theObserverunder the Freedom of Information Act.Action has been taken, however. The House of Commons and the Lords said their outlets now had a five-star rating after their most recent visits from inspectors. “We serve thousands of customers each year, with robust food safety and hygiene processes in place,” said a House of Commons spokesperson. “If issues are identified, we act quickly to address them.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In addition to inspections by Westminster city council, we have annual inspections from an independent food safety consultancy.”A government spokesperson said: “These reports are outdated, with most being over two years old. The health and safety of all staff is a top priority, and the issues raised at the time were promptly addressed. The most recent inspections have resulted in high, positive ratings for food hygiene.”Local authorities are responsible for inspecting businesses and enforcing food hygiene laws in their area. They can take action if they find standards unacceptable, with their powers ranging from requiring that issues be fixed, to closing the premises or bringing a prosecution. Inspections take place at up to five-year intervals, but are often more frequent.Explore more on these topicsFood safetyThe ObserverHouse of CommonsMinistry of DefencenewsShareReuse this content"

And, frankly, it’ll consign Keir Starmer to the bin of history.”The US president, Donald Trump, a longstanding critic of the amount fellow Nato countries spend on defence, has suggested members of the transatlantic alliance should spend 5% of GDP on their militaries.That prompted John Healey, the UK defence secretary, to acknowledge the UK and European allies must do more of the “heavy lifting” by increasing their defence spending so the US would not be tempted to leave the Nato alliance altogether, but he did not say when and by how much.Dannatt, a crossbench peer who was head of the army from 2006 to 2009, was also asked about Starmer’s suggestion that British soldiers could be deployed to Ukraine as peacekeepers in the event of a deal to end the war.Reflecting on how many soldiers would be needed, he told the programme: “It would probably require about 100,000 people. The UK would have to supply quite a proportion of that. And we really couldn’t do it. Our military is so run down at the present moment, numerically and as far as capability and equipment is concerned, it would potentially be quite embarrassing.”G7 delegates gathered in Munich on Friday for a major global security conference, amid concerns that officials in Moscow and Washington could be negotiating the future of European security over the heads of its leaders.Britain has so far sought to manage a delicate balance between supporting Ukraine against Russia’s invasion and keeping Trump on side, who has said heagreed with Putin to start “negotiations”.The foreign secretary, David Lammy, on Friday sat down for talks with the US vice-president, JD Vance, who said “we have a lot in common, and the special relationship between the United Kingdom and the United States will remain very strong”.In a call with the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Starmer said Britain was committed to Ukrainebeing on an “irreversible path” to joining Nato, and was “unequivocal that there could be no talks about Ukraine without Ukraine”.Explore more on these topicsDefence policyMilitaryBritish armyRichard DannattKeir StarmernewsShareReuse this content"

What I do know is that if you have a campaign which is led by state authorities to say this lawyer is not to be trusted and they’re undermining the Chinese state by engaging in legal work with the United Nations, it sends a green light to [its supporters] to send material like that.”As the leader of Lai’s international legal team, Gallagher has been targeted the most, including “hundreds” of attempts to hack her bank account. There has also been so-called “privilege phishing” – attempts to seek to persuade those who are targeted to divulge sensitive information, whichthe Bar Council has also warned about. Sometimes it is through emails created to appear to have been sent by Gallagher, or her contacts or colleagues.On one occasion an email purporting to be from her was sent to all of the other KCs in her chambers saying she had decided to resign because her work on the Lai case was putting all of them and their families in danger. “I woke up in a hotel room to a whole load of messages saying: ‘Are you OK? What can I do?’” she said.The team have also received WhatsApp calls which show up as being from colleagues when they are not.In March 2023, Gallagher and Jennifer Robinson, who is also on the Lai team, were followed around the UN office in Geneva by a man.. In June 2023, a fellow barrister, Tatyana Eatwell, hada speech at the UN human rights council interruptedby a delegation from China when she mentioned Lai. She said at a separate UN event “they accused us of being criminals … [it was] deeply intimidating”. Such behaviour has been highlighted in the last twoannual reprisals reportsby the UN secretary general.View image in fullscreenJonathan Price, Caoilfhionn Gallagher and Tatyana Eatwell, who cannot travel to countries that have extradition arrangements with China or Hong Kong.Photograph: Alicia Canter/The GuardianActivity obviously emanating from the Chinese state has also included denunciations in government statements and its closely controlled media. Other targeting of the lawyers is not so easily attributable, but Gallagher said: “We think because of the coordination of the emails and the cyber-attacks and the fact that they coincide with key moments in the case, we’ve good reason to believe that they’re state linked.”They have reported online attacks to specialist Metropolitan police officers, who she said had been helpful but were hamstrung by the sophistication of the overseas perpetrators. Gallagher said there were once 32 simultaneous attempts to hack her email account using virtual private networks (VPNs) to make it look as if the perpetrators were based anywhere from Delaware, in the US, to Kazakhstan and South Africa.Clerks and researchers – one of whom had their iPhone cloned – have also been targeted.Jonathan Price, another barrister on the team, said: “We have to be careful about who’s publicly in the team. It’s a conversation we have to have with anyone we use and sometimes the answer is: ‘I’d rather not.’”The lawyers, who cannot travel to countries that have extradition arrangements with China or Hong Kong, have chosen to speak out now because they believe that transnational repression and the targeting of lawyers is growing. Gallaghergave evidence on the issueto the UK parliament’s joint committee on human rights last week.“It is very difficult to deal with,” she said. “They are tactics which are designed to frighten us off doing our job or to make us worse at our jobs. And I think that’s why we’re redoubling our efforts. Because if they hate us – the lawyers – this much, think about how much they hate our client.”When contacted for comment, a spokesperson at China’s UK embassy just condemned Lai.Explore more on these topicsJimmy LaiChinaSurveillanceBarristersHackingnewsShareReuse this content"

Only half of those on board had life jackets. The French navy’s Dauphin helicopter was also involved in the rescue operation.Two people were carried unconscious on to the Abeille Normandie. One was resuscitated while the other was taken by helicopter to hospital, where they were later pronounced dead.The person is at least the fourth so far this year to die attempting to cross the Channel in a small boat.A Syrian man in his twenties is thought to have been crushed to deathon 11 January in an overcrowded boat that began to collapse after setting off from Sangatte. On 10 February two bodies were found after attempting to swim out to a small boat.So far this year more than 1,500 people have crossed the Channel in small boats including three people who made their own boat and crossed the Channel on 10 February. The UK government haslaunched initiativesthey say will“smash” the business modelof the smugglers who organise the Channel crossings.Last year 36,816 people crossed the Channel, down fromthe record high in 2022, when 45,755 crossed. Since small boat crossings began in 2018, more than 150,000 people have arrived in the UK by this route.A statement from the French maritime prefecture for the Channel and the North Sea said the Channel was particularly dangerous in the middle of winter for precarious and overloaded boats, as it was a busy shipping lane with difficult weather conditions.Utopia 56, a French organisation that supports migrants in northern Franceposted on X about Saturday’s death, describing it as a “harmful consequence” of government policies to stop small boats from crossing the Channel.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Several contractors also reported being laid off this week.Probationary employees include any staff who haven’t served the full time (usually a year or two) needed to gain civil service protection in their positions – and this also applies to senior officials who have recently changed positions.Staff at some health agencies, including HHS and CDC, reported being instructed not to talk about Doge in internal emails and messages, for fear of attracting attention through Freedom of Information Act (Foia) requests or searches from those who had gained access to these systems.“In my whole time in the federal government, I’ve never seen this,” said the CDC employee. “It’s just a complete upheaval.”Representatives of Doge gained access to the Atlanta offices of the CDC last week, according to sources who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak.Doge-affiliated officials also gained access to payment and contracting systems at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), according toreportingfrom the Wall Street Journal.Musk, the unpaid “special government employee” heading up Doge, appeared to confirm the CMS access and the search for potential fraud in Medicare payment systems: “Yeah, this is where the big money fraud is happening,” heallegedon X on 5 February.Medicare fraud has long been a focus of careful investigation, with 193 medical professionalsarrestedin June under the Biden administration on charges related to $2.75bn in suspected healthcare fraud.But stopping payments already authorized by Congress, as the Trump administration has already done with foreign assistance and federal grants and loans, is an unprecedented move.Doge representatives have also sought access to the HHS payment systems that process billions of dollars in healthcare funding, and seem to have gained access to at least some of them, the Washington Postreported.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Even small changes are a big deal, and need to be tested extensively before being deployed.Yet the legal repercussions of unlawful access and activities in federal systems are limited, he said.“The constraints on bad actors who are in there, inside the system, doing bad things, are relatively few,” Cory said.The data collected by agencies plays a crucial role in keeping Americans safe – particularly in ongoing outbreaks like bird flu, Cory said: “If it’s not possible to report that data and disseminate that data, then we’re all at risk.”Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationDonald TrumpElon MuskUS politicsBird fluEpidemicsHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

Some of the members have worked at the tech giant Google, and many have advocated for veganism and identify as transgender.Along the way, the group is believed to have bought a tugboat in Alaska under a plan to live on it to avoid high rents in northernCalifornia. The tugboat, part of the group’s “Rationalist Fleet”, now sits half-submerged near Pillar Point Harbor near San Jose.Much of what is known about the Zizians’ philosophy is gleaned from online postings in which LaSota wondered what would happen to society if it were stripped of morality through “evil people ganging up to kill off good people” or if the group’s goals “ultimately required sociopathy”.In one instance,according to an article in SFGatepublished earlier in February, LaSota faked her death. An obituary posted online mentioned a boating accident and spoke of LaSota “loving adventure, friends and family, music, blueberries, biking, computer games and animals”.But an analysis of interviews and online postings published by the Associated Press on Friday revealed how the group of young computer scientists appeared to have become increasingly violent.Maland, 44, was killed in a 20 January shootout following a traffic stop in Coventry,Vermont, a small town about 20 miles (32km) from the Canadian border. Washington state resident Teresa Youngblut, 21, faces two weapons charges in connection with the killing.She was traveling with German citizenOphelia Bauckholt. Both had connections to LaSota. The pair had been under the surveillance of authorities for several days after an employee at a hotel where they were staying reported seeing Youngblut carrying a gun.According to SFGate, they wore all black, carried weapons openly and wrapped their phones in aluminium foil. Investigators also said a night vision device and laptops were found in their Toyota Prius. Court records note that Youngblut’s diary contains several references to taking LSD.Bauckholt, 26, died in the Vermont shootout. Authorities have not specified whose bullets hit whom. Youngblut’s lawyer said through a spokesperson that they are not commenting. Youngblut pleaded not guilty in federal court on 7 February.In November 2019, LaSota; Emma Borhanian, 31; Gwen Danielson; and Alexander Leatham, 29, were arrested at a protest outside a northern California retreat center where a rationalist group was holding an event. The group said they were protesting sexual misconduct inside the group.In 2022, landlord Curtis Lind went to court to evict Borhanian, LaSota, Leatham and other tenants who had stopped paying rent at a Vallejo, California, property. Two days before the 15 November eviction deadline, prosecutors say, Leatham, Borhanian and Suri Dao attacked him.Lind shot his attackers, killing Borhanian and wounding Leatham. He survived being impaled with a sword but lost an eye. Prosecutors concluded he had acted in self-defense and charged Dao and Leatham with violent crimes.On 17 January, the 82-year-old landlord was stabbed to death. Maximilian Snyder, 22,an Oxford-educated data scientist, who had applied for a marriage license with Teresa Youngblut in Washington state in November, is charged with murder in that case.On New Year’s Eve 2022, Rita and Richard Zajko were shot and killed in Chester Heights,Pennsylvania.Police questioned the couple’s daughter, Michelle, at her home in Vermont, and a few weeks later, took her into custody at a Pennsylvania hotel. She was not arrested or charged. LaSota was at the hotel, too. She was arrested after refusing to cooperate with officers and charged with obstructing law enforcement and disorderly conduct.Six months later, LaSota was released on bail but stopped showing up for court. LaSota’s attorney, Daniel McGarrigle, said last month his client was “wholly and unequivocally innocent of the charges filed in this case”. She has missed court appearances in two states, and bench warrants have been issued for her arrest.Authorities attempting to piece together the pieces of the Zizian puzzle have acknowledged the potential connections between the Vermont shooting and previous incidents.“Teresa Youngblut is believed to have associations with other individuals suspected of violent acts in multiple states, to include Pennsylvania and California,” Sarah Ruane, a spokesperson for the FBI in Albany, New York,told USA Today.“The FBI is coordinating information sharing on any case-related details with our partners from various law enforcement agencies to effectively follow every lead and aggressively investigate these connections,” Ruane added.Explore more on these topicsUS crimeVermontPennsylvaniaCaliforniaGun crimeWest CoastnewsShareReuse this content"

In New York, Mangione is charged with three counts of murder as well as allegations that he killed Thompson “in furtherance of terrorism”, a charge that carries a maximum sentence of life in prison.Federal prosecutors separately charged Mangione in the killing with a four-count indictment that could bring thedeath penalty if he is convicted.Mangione was arrested in Pennsylvania days after Thompson’s slaying and transferred back to New York. He has pleaded not guilty to all charges against him.Mangione’s comments on the website are the first he has made since he yelled to reporters that coverage of the event had been “an insult to the intelligence of the American people and their lived experience”.The suspect, who is being held at Brooklyn’s Metropolitan Detention Center while awaiting trial, has been fighting the charges as much in the court of public opinion as in the courtroom. Amid the public, many have come to see him as a handsome vigilante.Pennsylvania’s governor, Josh Shapiro, has sharply criticized people who have suggested Mangione is a hero or justified in allegedly killing Thompson, whose survivors include his widow and their two high school-aged children.Shapiro said some reactions have been “deeply disturbing as some have looked to celebrate instead of condemning this killer”.“In a civil society, we are all less safe when ideologues engage in vigilante justice,” Shapiro said. “In some dark corners, this killer is being hailed as a hero. Hear me on this: he is no hero.”Apollpublished in late December by the National Opinion Research Center at the University of Chicago concluded that most Americans believe the national health insurance industry’s profits – aided greatly by routine denials of coverage – shared some responsibility for Thompson’s slaying. But the survey found about 80% of Americans believed Thompson’s killer had either “a great deal” or “a moderate amount” of responsibility for the murder.Nonetheless, people who are sympathetic to Mangione had raised more than $425,000 for his legal defense as of Saturday. His legal team has said it intends to accept those donations, which are being raised on theGiveSendGo platform.Explore more on these topicsBrian Thompson shootingGun crimeUS crimeHealth insuranceUS healthcarenewsShareReuse this content"

The gaunt appearance of the last group of released captives shocked and angered the Israeli public, andraised fears about the wellbeing of the remaining hostages.Of the Palestinian prisoners released on Saturday, 333 had been captured or arrested in Gaza since the beginning of the war. They were taken straight to the territory. Thirty-six Palestinians serving life sentences in Israeli jails were also released. About two dozen were immediately deported through Egypt to other Arab countries. One was taken to Jerusalem and 10 arrived by bus in Ramallah, the main city in theWest Bankand administrative centre of the Palestinian Authority, where a crowd had gathered to welcome them.1:33Tears and joy as released Palestinian prisoners and detainees reunite with families – videoThe prisoners, who were transferred to private cars and taken home, had all spent more than 20 years in Israeli prisons, according to Abdullah al-Zaghari, the chair of the Palestinian Prisoners Society.Most of those released on Saturday had been part of the military wing of Fatah, the dominant faction of the Palestinian Liberation Organisation, and had taken part in violent uprisings against Israeli occupation.“To feel free is indescribable,” said, Ameer Abu Ra’adaha, who spent 32 of his 51 years in jail. He said the prisoners knew there would be an exchange a few days before as the guards conducted raids on the cells and beat some of the inmates.Abu Ra’adaha said he only found he would be among those released at 6.30am on Saturday. He was told by prison guards who presented the departing prisoners with a T shirt expressing their reluctance to let them go.The T-shirts, produced on the orders of the head of the prison service, were printed with the words: “We will never forget and we will never forgive.”Abu Ra’adaha was hailed a hero at a community centre in al-Amariri camp in Ramallah, dressed in a black cap and green jacket with a Palestinian keffiyah around his shoulders. Men queued to embrace him, while the hall filled with teenagers and young boys who had come to catch a glimpse of the emaciated veteran, who looked stunned and exhausted.“I just want to get married, build a house and live my life,” Abu Ra’adaha said.Saturday’s exchange marks the latest scheduled step in the first phase of the Gaza ceasefire agreement, which came into effect on 19 January. However, the future of the agreement is still uncertain: under the terms of the 42-day first phase of the ceasefire brokered by Qatar, Egypt and the US, negotiations for a second phase had been due to start on 3 February.‘Time is running out’: frailty of freed hostages raises pressure on NetanyahuRead moreThe Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, sent negotiators to Doha days later, but the delegation was not mandated to discuss phase two, which is meant to lay out steps towards ending the war.The US secretary of state,Marco Rubio, whose country is Israel’s top backer and one of the truce mediators, is due to arrive in Israel late on Saturday to discuss the truce’s future and Trump’s depopulation plan with Israeli officials.Arab leaders have flatly rejected Trump’s proposal, which international law experts say amounts to ethnic cleansing.Saudi Arabia is hosting delegations from Egypt, Jordan, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates on Thursday for a summit on the issue, and the Arab League will convene to discuss alternatives on 27 February.Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warGazaHamasIsraelWest BankPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

However,Rwandacontinues to deny its forces have crossed into the country and has repeatedly denied involvement in supporting the M23 rebels.View image in fullscreenThérèse Kayikwamba Wagner, foreign minister of the Democratic Republic of the Congo.Photograph: Lev Radin/Rex/ShutterstockWagner told the Guardian: “We offered to meet Arsenal, but they didn’t reach out or take us up on the offer. We have not received an answer. Apparently they are not interested in meeting us.”A member of a Congolese diaspora group in London, who requested not to be named, said Arsenal’s response was an “outrageous insult” to what they said were “millions” of fans in a country the size of western Europe.In contrast, another leading club with the same Rwandan sponsorship deal – Germany’s Bayern Munich – sent two employees to Rwanda to monitor the escalating situation and is in contact with the German foreign ministry.Before Wagner arrived in London she urged the owners of Arsenal to end what she called its “bloodstained” deal with Visit Rwanda.Arsenal’s current Visit Rwanda arrangement, which has been running since 2021, is believed to be worth £10m a year and will continue until next year. Visit Rwanda is an arm of the Rwanda Development Board, a government department.Rwanda’s president,Paul Kagame, is also head of its military.Last week, the Guardianexposed the extent of Rwanda’s involvementin the M23 offensive, revealing that hundreds, possibly thousands, of its troops had been killed during clandestine missions in the Congo.Rwandan troops led by the M23 recently seized the Congolese city of Goma, and are now moving south in an offensive that experts warn threatens to deepen a humanitarian catastrophe with about 700,000 people forced from their homes already this year.Signs of a concerted international response to the crisis have been slow but on Thursday the European parliament urged theEU to freeze direct budget support for Rwandauntil it breaks links with the M23 rebels.The UK foreign secretary,David Lammy, last month warnedthat Rwanda had put $1bn of global aid under threat by taking part in the invasion of the DRC. No funding, however, appears to have been withdrawn as yet.Wagner said: “Condemnations and declarations have had a limited impact when it comes to curtailing President Kagame’s actions and ambitions.”The fall of Goma: 16 days of chaos and fear – in picturesRead moreWagner met Lammy and Africa minister Lord Collins of Highbury this week and said there was a “continuous conversation” in which she was pushing for action. “Different options are being analysed but I have not had a firm promise of what is to come.“There is still an imperative for sanctions and firm action. We have a situation where a country is occupying another country and which is pillaging natural resources, is responsible for the killing of at least 3,000 civilians and also peacekeepers.“The killing has to stop, the pillaging has to stop. The crooks have toleave the DRC.”Another big European club – Paris St-Germain – is also under pressure because of its Visit Rwanda deal, withformer DRC captain Youssouf Mulumbuasking it to reconsider its partnership.View image in fullscreenProtesters call for football teams to end their Visit Rwanda deals outside the BBC Broadcasting House on 8 February.Photograph: Sopa Images/LightRocket/Getty ImagesThis week, theDRC also urged Formula One to end talks with Rwandaover hosting a race, saying the sport risks having its brand “smeared by a bloodstained association”.Arsenal’s deal with Visit Rwanda began in May 2018, when it signed a three-year deal with the Rwanda Development Board, followed byanother in 2021.Its logo appears on the shirt sleeves of Arsenal’s men’s, women’s and youth teams and can be seen on boards at the Emirates Stadium and on interview backdrops.Part of the deal has seen past and present Arsenal players visit Rwanda, most notably during August 2022 whenthe club published footage on its channelsof Ray Parlour and Robert Pires’ trip.Arsenal did not respond to requests for comment.Explore more on these topicsGlobal developmentArsenalDemocratic Republic of the CongoRwandaAfricaConflict and armsnewsShareReuse this content"

And given Trump’s eagerness to flex his presidential authority, the fallout could be particularly severe, depending on how the office of management and budget (OMB) handled a shutdown.To be sure,Republicansare taking the lead on reaching a funding deal, as they control the White House and both chambers of Congress, but party leaders will absolutely need Democrats’ assistance to pass a bill. While Republicans hold a 53-to-47 advantage in theSenate, any funding bill will need the support of at least 60 senators to overcome the filibuster.In theHouse, Republicans hold a razor-thin majority of 218 to 215, and hard-right lawmakers’ demands for steeper spending cuts will likely force the speaker, RepublicanMike Johnson, to also rely on Democratic support to pass a funding bill.US Democrats call for more aggressive tactics against Trump and Musk: ‘We’re going to be the opposition’Read more“There’s no reasonable funding bill that could make its way through the Senate that wouldn’t cause uproar in the Republican party on the House side,” said Ezra Levin, co-founder and co-executive director of the progressive group Indivisible. “That is the fault of theRepublicansin the House, not anybody else. But because of that, it is something that is giving Democrats in the House leverage.”In recent weeks, a bipartisan group of congressional appropriators from both chambers have met to hash out the details of a potential funding agreement, butHakeem Jeffries, the House Democratic leader, suggested on Thursday that Johnson had instructed his conference members to “walk away” from the talks.“At this moment, there is no discussion because the speaker of the House has apparently ordered House Republican appropriators to walk away from the negotiating table,” Jeffries told reporters. “They are marching America toward a reckless Republican shutdown.”Johnson shot back that Democrats appeared “not interested in keeping the government funded”, adding: “So we will get the job done. We’re not going to shut the government down. We’ll figure out a path through this.”The dynamics of the funding fight have empowered some Democrats to suggest that the negotiations could become a powerful piece of political leverage as they scramble to disrupt Trump’s efforts to freeze federal funding, unilaterally shutter the foreign-aid agency USAid and carry outmass firingsacross the government.“I cannot support efforts that will continue this lawlessness that we’re seeing when it comes to this administration’s actions,” Andy Kim, a Democratic senator of New Jersey, said on NBC’s Meet the Press last weekend. “And for us to be able to support government funding in that way, only for them to turn it around, to dismantle the government – that is not something that should be allowed.”Progressive organizers have called on Democratic lawmakers to hold the line in the negotiations to ensure Congress passes a clean funding bill that Trump will be required to faithfully implement.On Monday, prominent congressional Democratsralliedwith progressive groups outside the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in Washington, and 15 of them pledged to withhold their support from a funding deal until Trump’s “constitutional crisis” comes to an end.“We’re not just looking for statements. We’re not looking for protest votes. We’re also asking them to identify where they have power, where they have leverage and use that power,” Levin said. “And because of the nature of this funding fight, this is a clear opportunity.”Other Democrats have appeared much more cautious when it comes to the possibility of a shutdown, even as they insist that Republicans should shoulder the blame for any funding lapse.The senatorCory Booker, a Democrat of New Jersey, argued that Democrats must now embrace their role as “a party of protecting residents, protecting veterans, protecting first responders, protecting American safety from [Trump’s] illegal actions”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They’re the party of government chaos,” Booker said on CNN’s State of the Union last weekend. “So we’re not looking to shut down the government. We’re looking actually to protect people.”The political fallout of past shutdowns may give Democrats pause as well.The last shutdown occurred during Trump’s first term and began in December 2018, eventually stretching on for 35 days and becoming the longest shutdown in US history. It started after Trump demanded that Congress approve billions of dollars in funding to construct a wall along theUS-Mexico border, and it ended with Trump signing a bipartisan bill that included no money for the wall. At the time, an NBC News/Wall Street Journalpollshowed 50% of Americans blamed Trump for the shutdown, while 37% said congressional Democrats were responsible.“Historically, I think it has been the case that shutdowns are costly, and they’re disruptive. When they conclude, you look back and wonder, what did we get for all of that? The answer is usually nothing,” said Gordon Gray, executive director of Pinpoint Policy Institute and a former Republican staffer for the Senate budget committee. “For people who have to interact with the government during a shutdown [and] for the workforce, there’s real downsides. Politically, there just seems to be more downside than upside.”This shutdown, if it occurs, could be unlike any other.Democrats demand conflict-of-interest answers over Elon Musk ‘Doge’ roleRead moreTrump has shown an extraordinary willingness to test the bounds of executive power, and while past presidents have taken steps to alleviate the pain caused by shutdowns, he may choose not to do so. Considering his apparent fixation on eliminating government “waste”, some fear Trump and the new OMB director,Russell Vought, might use the shutdown as an opportunity to sideline federal agencies and departments that the president deems unimportant.“There’s a tremendous degree of discretion that OMB can exert in its interpretation of this,” Gray said. “Clearly this administration is willing to contemplate its discretion more expansively than we’ve seen. It would not surprise me if we saw novel developments under Trump.”Levin agreed that it is entirely possible Trump and some of his congressional allies may want to “shut down the government so that they can more easily steamroll” federal agencies. He expects some House Republicans to propose funding provisions that will be absolute non-starters with Democrats, such as eliminating the health insurance program Medicaid, to potentially derail negotiations.“I absolutely think it’s possible that the Republicans’ plan is to drive us into shutdown. I think that it is giving them the benefit of the doubt to say that they are interested in making any kind of deal,” Levin said. “Democrats have some amount of leverage here, but if we head into shutdown, there should be no illusion of who benefits and whose grand plan this is.”Explore more on these topicsUS CongressDemocratsRepublicansMike JohnsonTrump administrationDonald TrumpElon MuskShareReuse this content"

He closed his eyes and held his breath.“When its mouth closed around me and pulled me down, I felt like I was in a whirlpool, lying down and spinning around,”he said. For a few fleeting moments, his fate was in the jaws of the 40-tonne cetacean. “If it had eaten me, I would’ve died. There was nothing I could do about it.”View image in fullscreenAdrián Simancas.Photograph: APThe terrifying ordeal lasted only a few seconds. Before he knew it, Simancas felt himself being pulled up to the surface by his lifejacket. Unhurt but shocked, he called for his father, who was paddling alongside him – and who had captured the incident on the 360-degree camera mounted to his raft.The video has since gone viral, prompting a wave of global commentary playfully comparing Simancas to figures including Pinocchio and Jonah. But it has also fuelled some misinformation about whale behaviour, causing concern within the scientific community.“Humpback whales have a small oesophagus and feed on small prey (small fish, krill), so they could not ‘devour’ or ‘swallow’ a human,” said María José Pérez Álvarez, a marine biologist at Universidad de Chile and Base Millennium Institute. She added that humpback whales do not have teeth, but rather brush-like plates they use to trap and filter their prey. “It could not have bitten him either,” she said.Although Simancas was unharmed, Pérez Álvarez cautions that human-whale interactions should be avoided at all costs: “A humpback whale is around 18 metres long. It could have hit him hard with some part of its body, even if unintentionally, and the person could have been injured.”0:57'I thought it had eaten me': humpback whale briefly swallows kayaker off the coast of Chile – videoKayakers in the area have also urged caution. Guillermo Meza operates a company specialising in kayaking tours and worries that Simancas had been too far out at sea.“I would never have gone that far into the open sea on an inflatable raft,” he said. He also warned that the two men had been far too close to the whale. “We advise maintaining distances of more than 100 metres, and if they get close to us, we stay completely still,” he said.Chilean law stipulates that legal sighting distances must be at least 100 metres from any whale. Simancas and his father are both wildlife and outdoor enthusiasts, and Simancas maintains that neither saw the whale nor intentionally approached it.“The sea was very calm. We were reaching the end of the bay when the whale appeared,” he said. “I didn’t see any schools of fish or any type of strange movements. The whale lunged from behind. It was a total surprise.”Simancas has practised pack rafting for about a year. The inflatable raft folds into a portable backpack, allowing him to combine trekking with rafting, traversing both sea and land.View image in fullscreenThe humpback whale breaks the surface near Adrián Simancas’s raft.Photograph: APCelebrating the father’s birthday, the duo had started their journey at Fin de Camino, which marks the end of the road on the continent, and one of the southernmost places in the world. Their planned route combined rafting and trekking to a small island.As one of Simancas’s paddles had been damaged in the whale encounter, they turned back and navigated their way home by holding their rafts together, with one manning the left and the other in charge of the right paddle.Simancas says that the experience has left him with a deeper respect for nature, and that he will take even greater safety precautions in future – namely, staying closer to the shoreline.“I felt blessed with a second chance to review the mistakes that led me to be there – not just in the expedition, but in life itself,” he says. But he won’t be going on any more rafting adventures this season: “I’ll wait until next year.”Explore more on these topicsEnvironmentSeascape: the state of our oceansWhalesCetaceansChileWildlifeMarine lifeAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

Colbert eventually left alone. Hotel staff found Manzano dead after he missed a meeting about his work for the Spanish-language television channel Telemundo Kansas City, which would be chronicling that city’s football team, the Chiefs, playing the Philadelphia Eagles in the Super Bowl at New Orleans’ Caesars Superdome on 9 February.Woman linked to death of Super Bowl reporter allegedly had similar arrestsRead moreInvestigators later arrested Colbert, 48, on allegations that she had stolen the credit card Manzano had used to check in to his hotel along with his cellphone. They also began theorizing that Colbert may have drugged Manzano, 27, before his death because of news stories documenting allegations that she had drugged and robbed men in Las Vegas, though the results of tests showing which substances may have been in the late reporter’s body remained pending Friday.Those test results could lead to Colbert being charged directly with Manzano’s death. Nonetheless, in the meantime, international news coverage of Manzano’s death prompted Butler tocome forward in the mediaand describe what he endured when he, too, had met Colbert on Bourbon.He said he had been in the city from out of town renovating a property he owns and had gone out to Bourbon Street to unwind on the evening of 5 November 2021. Late into the night, Colbert and another woman accompanied Butler into a bar, where they shared drinks. He “started feeling woozy” unusually quickly, as police later wrote in a sworn statement filed in court, and he decided to head home.As he climbed into a cab, Colbert got in and said: “Let me get you home safe.” Then she accompanied him to the property he was renovating, court documents said. Butler’s last recollection of the night was walking into the home. His next memory was being woken by his leasing agent and realizing that his gold ring, watch, cellphone and wallet were gone.More than $80,000 in cryptocurrency that he had been counting on for his retirement was missing, too. His credit card had been used to charge thousands of dollars at retailers.Because he was focused on finding out who had robbed him, Butler said he did not go to the hospital to see what may have been put in his drink.Police said they eventually identified Colbert as Butler’s thief because she had been associated with the name of the digital cloud account to which his crypto savings was transferred: “QueenTX100.” Authorities charged her with crimes including theft and fraud, at one point publishing a news release about the case.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines USFree newsletterGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Both men filed reports with police in New Orleans, as NBC Newsreportedon Saturday, but neither evidently led anywhere.Colbert was eventually convicted at trial in Butler’s case. Butler hoped she would receive a stiff punishment: not only had he submitted a statement to the court outlining how Colbert’s actions had “devastated [his] life”, but also, in early 2022, she had been accused of stealing $100,000 in cash, jewelry, upscale luggage and casino chips from the Las Vegas hotel room of another man whom she had allegedly drugged.Furthermore, while out on bond in the Las Vegas case, she had allegedly drugged another man there and stolen his $60,000 watch, casino chips and credit cards after he invited her to his hotel room.Prosecutors in Las Vegas ultimately dismissed both of those cases, according to court records. However, a third case from 2022 in Las Vegas remained unresolved, centering on allegations that she had driven through a school area at nearly 100mph, landing her charges of speeding, among other offenses.Butler did not see Colbert get the punishment he had hoped for. She was put on probation for five years and ordered to pay $50,000 in restitution – at monthly payments of $834 for the duration of her sentence.According to Butler, Colbert has not paid him a cent of restitution. He submitted a letter to the courthouse where Colbert was convicted that asked: “Why was someone with such a history of endangering lives given yet another chance? If someone dies due to her actions in the future, their blood will undeniably be on the hands of those who allowed her to escape real accountability today.”It was a little more than two months after Butler sent his letter that Manzano – a widowed father of a toddler – was found dead, and Colbert was arrested again.Among hernumerous other legal issuesconfronting her in various jurisdictions, prosecutors in Butler’s case by Monday had filed a motion to revoke Colbert’s probation and send her to prison.Authorities have also said they are revisiting the death in New Orleans of a tourist from Maryland who was found dead in his hotel room in December after last being seen walking down Bourbon Street. John Jenkins’ death was ruled accidental – resulting from cocaine and ethanol toxicity – but his family reported to police that some of his belongings were missing, as New Orleans’ nola.comreported.Butler on Friday said all he could hope for now would be for his case and Colbert’s to spark a meaningful dialogue about the need for people with histories like hers to face substantial consequences before it’s too late.“I was afraid she would strike again and again and again,” Butler said. “And … I guess I would like to see some reform.”This article was amended on 15 February 2025 to correct the age of Adan Manzano; he was 27, not 26 an earlier version said.Explore more on these topicsLouisianaSuper Bowl LIXUS crimeNew OrleansnewsShareReuse this content"

It’s a bit disconcerting to stop watching two-fifths of the way in, but for those wondering if this dilutes or betrays the great cause of the big screen – well, it was good enough for David Lynch. Justin Kurzel’s The Narrow Road to the Deep North has now come to Berlin, a big, bold, complicatedly sensual epic of wartime anguish and personal reckoning, adapted by screenwriter Shaun Grant from the Booker prize winning bestseller by Richard Flanagan.The story operates in three phases: before, during and after the second world war.Jacob Elordiis Dorrigo Evans, an Australian medical student about to ship out, engaged to a beautiful woman from a wealthy family – but he has a passionate affair with Amy (Odessa Young), the younger second wife of his uncle Keith (Simon Baker).During the war, he is captured by the Japanese and forced to work on the Burma railway – beaten, brutalised and tortured like all the rest. After the war, as an older man in 1989, Dorrigo is played by Ciarán Hinds; he has become a celebrated surgeon living in a handsome modernist house and a spokesperson for his generation of ex-servicemen. He is shown exploding with rage at a young journalist who suggests that what the Japanese suffered at Hiroshima and Nagasaki more than cancels what they did to Allied PoWs on the Burma railway.View image in fullscreenA passionate affair … Jacob Elordi and Odessa Young as Dorrigo and Amy in The Narrow Road to the Deep North.Photograph: Ingvar Kenne/Curio/Sony Pictures TelevisionWhat is interesting here is not that all the drama – of Dorrigo’s relationship with Amy, of the war itself – happened in the past, while the present is a matter of bittersweet memories and a placidly married Dorrigo not talking to his wife Ella (Heather Mitchell) about a lifetime of lies and guilt. No: dramatic and transgressive things are happening right now. Older Dorrigo is having a passionate affair with Lynette (Essie Davis), the wife of a surgeon colleague, and who’s to say if that liaison is not every bit as meaningful as the one transfigured by the wartime past? Perhaps what the war has taught Dorrigo is to grab moments of sensual pleasure when you can.The drama indirectly discloses mysteries which underpin events: Dorrigo’s unreflective Uncle Keith (an unassumingly good performance from Simon Baker) seems very relaxed about letting his nephew spend quality time with the young second wife he took soon after the death of his first. Is it because he himself feels guilt? That he senses Amy is dissatisfied and is prepared to turn a blind eye to a connection with the nephew he thinks may well die in the war? And what are Dorrigo’s feelings about that or anything else? Both Elordi’s younger and Hinds’s older Dorrigo are opaque – as the older man testily explains to the young journalist: feelings were not as fashionable in the 40s as they are now. And perhaps feelings are what got scorched away by the violence of war.Any drama with this subject and these scenes – the brutality of the work camps, the terrible poignancy of the PoWs taking a delusional pride in their enforced labour, the muster parades of emaciated men, the confrontations between western and Japanese officers – inevitably brings back memories of a classic like David Lean’s The Bridge on the River Kwai (even the title of this has, I suspect, a tiny echo). Perhaps the key horrible sequence is the hint of friendship between Dorrigo and the relatively kindly Maj Nakamura (Shô Kasamatsu), who then tactlessly reveals to his commanding officer Col Kota (Taki Abe) that he has been almost fraternising with him. Coolly, Kota asks the Major if he has ever beheaded a man, an experience he suggests should be a rite of passage for a Japanese warrior. He orders one shivering Australian captive to kneel in front of him, the increasingly uneasy Major and the rest of the prisoners – just to demonstrate the stance with the sword, just a theoretical test, he assures everyone.Kurzel handles the material with confidence and storytelling verve and gets fervent, focused performances from Elordi, Hinds and Young.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewBerlin film festivalJacob ElordireviewsShareReuse this content"

Adapted by Bong from Edward Ashton’s novel Mickey7, it starsRobert Pattinsonas a bio-clone menial worker of the future condemned to eternal life, or eternal death, by being repeatedly killed in the service of a space exploration corporation doing fatally dangerous jobs and then reincarnated.It’s a broad-brush futurist satire on the theme of Elon Musk-type tech bros who say that whining about the environment is for libtards because we’re all shooting off for space really soon, where there have to be viable planets somewhere, and any current alien inhabitants are expendable – as indeed are the working humans who are getting us out to new worlds.Mickey 17 is something in the style of hisSnowpiercer(2013) orOkja(2017), and Bong’s “creature feature” reflex is an extravagant style that’s been enjoyable in the past. Mickey 17 is visually spectacular, with some very sharp, angular moments of pathos and horror – maybe inevitably, these come in the first act when the bizarrely shocking premise is established and before the story grinds more sympathetically into gear. But at two hours and 17 minutes, this is a baggy and sometimes loose film whose narrative tendons are a bit slack sometimes; the panto-villain turns from Mark Ruffalo and Toni Collette sometimes make it look – not unpleasantly, in fact – like a kids’ TV special.Pattinson plays Mickey Barnes, a hapless loser who owes money to terrifying loan sharks, along with his equally rackety business partner Timo (Steven Yeun). To escape these goons, Mickey and Timo sign on for a dangerous interplanetary expedition masterminded by a creepy populist-plutocrat with shiny teeth and slicked-back hair: Kenneth Marshall (Ruffalo) and his lady wife Ylfa (Collette); their presence reminds us of Bong’s apparent interest in Roald Dahl.View image in fullscreenMark Ruffalo and Toni Colette in the film.Photograph: Jonathan Olley/© 2025 Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc. All Rights ReservedThey blast off into space where poor, stupid Mickey agrees to be an “expendable”: he has to do all the suicidally dangerous jobs because when he dies, his body is just disposed of and a new one is bio-printed with all memories and personality reinstalled – something Mickey accepts with stoic humility. The crisis comes as the ship approaches a likely looking planet whose “creeper” inhabitants, like giant fanged insects, have to be exterminated; Mickey himself, on his 17th incarnation, falls in love with fellow crew member Nasha (Naomi Ackie), but things are complicated when Mickey fails to die as anticipated and must live alongside a new version – Mickey 18, a “duplicate” who is as ruthless and violent as Mickey 17 is gentle and kind.It’s a strange story in its way, like a sci-fi horror in which all the horror, as well as all the cynicism and pessimism, has been removed. For all the bizarre violence and gross-out display, Mickey 17 has a kind of optimism operating against the fear, and we can feel the happy ending’s eventual arrival – although with this running time, it’s a long way off. There is, however, a weird moment when one of the creepy creatures appears to suck on a crew-member’s face – the visual echo of Ridley Scott’s Alien is a reminder of something leaner, meaner and darker.View image in fullscreenNaomi Ackie and Robert Pattinson in the film.Photograph: © 2025 Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc. All Rights ReservedPerhaps the most interesting part of the film is something on which Bong spends least time: the fact that Mickey knows something of which the rest of humanity is ignorant. The crew keep asking him: what is it like to die? Is it a feeling, an experience? Do you remember it afterwards? It has happened to him 16 times. Surely he knows the answer to this by now? Or is the eternally living, eternally dying Mickey as clueless on the subject as everyone else?Pattinson’s saturnine look gives something mysterious to the role, but in years gone by Bong could just as well as have cast Tom Hanks and encouraged him to go into Forrest Gump mode. It’s eerie, startling – and yet also unexpectedly benign.Mickey 17 is premiering at theBerlin film festivaland opens in the UK on 18 AprilExplore more on these topicsBerlin film festivalThe ObserverFestivalsBong Joon-hoParasiteRobert PattinsonToni ColletteMark RuffaloreviewsShareReuse this content"

But when it was announced that ­season three would not only be filmed in her country, but would also ­feature one of Thailand’s most famous pop stars,Lalisa Manobal– better known ­simply as Lisa – Geeratiya and legions of other fans have followed the ­filming closely.Over the past year, photos of the crew filming on the tourist islands of Phuket and Samui have gone viral across Lisa fan pages, and hashtags speculated on the kind of character the singer, from the K pop group Blackpink, might play. A premiere was held in Bangkok on Friday night and ­season three will be released on Sunday in the US and on Mondaytomorrow in the UK.“It’s very exciting for me – it’s her debut as a Thai actress, and she’s starring as a Thai character,” said Geeratiya, 36. She felt goosebumps when she heard Lisa, who often speaks in English in international interviews, using Thai in a promotional clip from the series. “I can hear her lines without having to translate it … I feel like it’s a little win for us.”View image in fullscreenK-pop star Lalisa Manobal – better known simply as Lisa – at Friday’s premiere in Bangkok.Photograph: Rungroj Yongrit/EPAThe country’s tourism sector is also excited. The show’s previous settings, Hawaii and Sicily, both saw surges in interest from tourists after appearing, leading to a phenomenon dubbed “theWhite Lotuseffect”. The first season, which was filmed at the Four Seasons Resort Maui at Wailea in Hawaii, prompted a 425% year-on-year increase in the hotel’s web traffic, according to reports. San Domenico Palace, a former monastery in Sicily that featured in season two, reported that it wasfully booked for months.InThailand, industry experts are hoping for a similar boost. Thienprasit Chaiyapatranun, president of the Thai Hotels Association, said he believed bookings had already increased. “The high season last year – November, December, and January – in the southern part of the country, especially Samui, was fully booked,” he said.He expected luxury parts of the market would benefit the most fromThe White Lotus, a satire on wealth and privilege. The series features some of Thailand’s most exclusive locations, including the Four Seasons Samui, a resort surrounded by pristine sandy beaches, ­tropical forest and the Gulf of Thailand. A two-night stay in March would cost upwards of £1,700.Marisa Sukosol Nunbhakdi, president of the tourism subcommittee of the National Soft Power Strategy Committee, said she believed the series, which explores spirituality and Buddhism, could also help establish Thailand as a spiritual or wellness destination, one of the government’s ambitions.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But when you harbor its cultural cachet, the respect artists have forSaturday Night Liveand its stunningly expansive rolodex, as well as the sheer production power of both SNL honcho Lorne Michaels and producer Mark Ronson, the result is a three-hour-plus extravaganza to rival even the starriest, most packed Grammys, Oscars or its ilk.Saturday Night Live: the 20 greatest sketches everRead moreAmid New York’s bitter chill on Valentine’s night, the event took place at Radio City Music Hall, a perfect home considering its Rockefeller Center confines are only a hop, skip and a jump from SNL’s Studio 8H at nearby NBC Studios. Its art deco space serves as the epitome of New York City: a tourist mecca beloved by hardscrabble locals. So it seemed natural that the Rockettes and SNL would both have graced its hallowed stage at one time.It was clear this was a unique audience. Aside from normal fans who populated the pit, the audience was made up of former hosts, cast members, writers and friends of the show. The show’s expansive legacy played out as a dynamic tapestry in the lobby: lumbering down its carpeted floor flanked by his family was a baseball hat-clad Chevy Chase, a veteran of the original 1975 cast. Over there, in a tank top in line for beer at the concession stand, palling around with the bartender, was Jason Momoa; nearby, Pete Davidson (cast member 2014-2022) kibitzed with Nate Bargatze.View image in fullscreenAlec Baldwin and Lorne Michaels.Photograph: John Nacion/Variety/Getty ImagesAll-star SNL host Alec Baldwin chatted gamely and caught up with the SNL team, as Paul Rudd and James Franco hugged it out outside. Sharp-in-a-suit Miles Teller, a former host, and his wife seemed to be on a double date with fellow former host Anya Taylor-Joy and her husband. Former cast members Jon Lovitz (1985-1990) and Horatio Sanz (1998-2006) also hugged it out. New-generation stars also made their presence known, from Hot Ones ringleader Sean Evans to the comedian/podcast host Theo Von, as did TV personality besties Andy Cohen and Anderson Cooper, to name a small smattering of faces.Inside, the 6,000-seat venue was outfitted with three stages, two of them flanked by replicas of Grand Central Station, a nod to the show’s current set. Opening the proceedings was Tonight Show host Jimmy Fallon (cast member 1998-2004), who busted out an energetic tribute to the Blues Brothers: perhaps it was too energetic, with Fallon subsequently out of breath for his monologue, adding a sense of energy. “I have two things in common with SNL,” he said into the mic. “This year we both turn 50 and, if we’re being honest, we both peaked around 25.”The show was divided into segments meant to honor a specific aspect of SNL’s music history. Miley Cyrus, who memorably sang during SNL’s 40th anniversary special 10 years ago, helped start things off with her own hit Flowers as well as a tribute to Queen in the form of a cover of Crazy Little Thing Called Love, which the Freddie Mercury-backed band performed on the show in 1982. Bad Bunny was trotted out to show continuing force, as the Puerto Rican icon performed his latest hit DtMF.View image in fullscreenBill Murray.Photograph: Peacock/Todd Owyoung/Getty ImagesIn tribute to frequent SNL guest Tom Petty, Eddie Vedder performed The Waiting while nodding to other fallen SNL favorites, like John Belushi and Gilda Radner. Jelly Roll paid tribute to Johnny Cash, while Post Malone and the surviving members of Nirvana sang Smells Like Teen Spirit (they were introduced as Post Nirvana), while an alt all-star mashup of David Byrne,Arcade Fireand St Vincent teamed up for Heroes in honor of David Bowie (who performed on the show four times, first making his debut in 1979).Following up memorable appearances during both Fire Aid and the Grammys earlier this month wasLady Gaga. When she first tried to perform her Star Is Born hit Shallow early in the show, she was sitting alongside Andy Samberg, who, in a cowboy hat, garbled the song’s first line deliciously out of key. “Andy, Andy, I gotta stop you,” said Gaga with her hands on her head. “’Cause it’s bad?” he shot back. “Yes, it’s very bad,” she said.In reality, it was a gag to lead into a medley of Samberg’s comedy trio The Lonely Island’s range of viral musical parodies including Dick in a Box (with Gaga taking original duet partner Justin Timberlake’s lines), I Just Had Sex (assisted by Bad Bunny) and I’m on a Boat (assisted by T-Pain). Most impressive was a performance of Lazy Sunday, a rap he concocted with cast member Chris Parnell (1998-2006) with the two delivering a pitch-perfect version of the song that shot him to fame and wound up popularizing YouTube at the time.View image in fullscreenBad Bunny, Chris Parnell, Lady Gaga and Andy Samberg.Photograph: Virginia Sherwood/APThe extravaganza was sprinkled with a bevy of other comedy music moments, with Bill Murray (and his 70s-era Nick the Lounge Singer bit) as well asWill Ferrelland Ana Gasteyer (as hopelessly-out-of-touch music teachers Bobbi and Marty Culp), the latter of whom nerdily covered Kendrick Lamar’s fresh from the Super Bowl anthem Not Like Us. Elsewhere, Tracy Morgan sang his swingin’ theme to his popular sketch Astronaut Jones.“Please take your seats, please take your seats,” the director pleaded into the mic every commercial break as the connected audience caught up with each other. Despite its extended runtime, the show’s incredible zigzagging demanded and secured everybody’s ongoing attention, with the audience perhaps cheering loudest for Cher (If I Could Turn Back Time) and the Backstreet Boys, with the crowd (including Jerry Seinfeld) singing along to every word of I Want It That Way. Meanwhile, Brandi Carlile earned a standing ovation for her 2018 ballad The Joke.View image in fullscreenLauryn Hill and Wyclef Jean.Photograph: Todd Owyoung/APYou know it was a big night when Chris Martin merely served as a piano player for one set, simply accompanying Bonnie Raitt on Thing Called Love, a song she originally performed on the show in 1990. Speaking of all-star musicians, The Roots deftly served as house band; with Questlove on drums, they helped back everyone from the B-52’s to Lauryn Hill and Wyclef Jean. Elsewhere,Snoop Doggrapped Gin and Juice, which he performed on the show in 1994 (then known as Snoop Doggy Dogg, of course).By the end of any regular episode of Saturday Night Live, it’s clear where the highs and lows were; the very nature of the show is that it’s designed to represent a disparate litany of comedic tastes. Music, perhaps, is less subjective; every song has a beat to latch on to. Perhaps in that sense, as Jack White closed things out with Seven Nation Army, the homecoming bash was void of any low points. If only every concert were like this.Explore more on these topicsSaturday Night LiveWill FerrellLady GagaArcade FireSnoop DoggUS televisionTV comedyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The pair discuss censorship, risk-taking, the far right, and ask: are celeb-led plays ruining the West End?Sat 15 Feb 2025 06.55 ESTLast modified on Sat 15 Feb 2025 07.39 ESTShareThe first timeCate Blanchettwas cast in The Seagull, she was in Sydney and in her 20s, a young stage actor playing the part of another young stage actor who was desperate for fame and dizzyingly in love. It was 1997, at Belvoir St theatre, and Blanchett was very much in love herself, having recently got together with the writer-director Andrew Upton, who she would marry later that year. Though the part of Ninain Anton Chekhov’s drama involved far more heartbreak – the character is left emotionally wrecked after being dropped by her lover – and Blanchett remembers “I’d just met Andrew and was madly in love and thought: ‘How am I going to go out every night and be broken open when I’m so deeply happy?’”She clearly pulled it off: among those who saw her in the Australian director Neil Armfield’s production was the director Jane Campion, who reportedly thought Blanchett’s portrayal so “utterly perfect and true” thatshe wished Chekhov had been there to see it.If the audience fell in love with Blanchett then, she in turn fell in love – with Chekhov’s play: “It’s so fuelled by perplexed, dissatisfied, annoyed people who do really strange things, but in Chekhov those people really are anchored by love,” she says today.It’s no surprise that almost 30 years later she is returning to the 1896 comedy at the Barbican theatre in London, to play Irina Arkadina, another actor, but this time in her middle years and supremely starry, having made her name on screen and stage. The original drama sees Chekhov’s typically unfulfilled characters become embroiled in a four-way love triangle: Nina is the aspiring actor who falls for Trigorin, a famous writer romantically attached to Arkadina, whose son, Konstantin is, in turn, besotted with Nina and at loggerheads with the artistic values of his famous mother and her lover. It is a play that treads a delicate line between the comic and tragic, and tussles with questions around the value of theatre as well as intergenerational conflict.Its two central female characters stand at diametric opposites, in love and in the world of the stage. There is an evident synergy between life and art, from Nina to Arkadina, given the trajectory of Blanchett’s career since 1997. “It’s really interesting coming back from inhabiting the equal and opposite end of the spectrum after having a career in theatre,” she says, but she also points out that this production is “profoundly different” because of its director and company of actors, which ranges from Tom Burke and Jason Watkins to Emma Corrin (playing Nina) and Kodi Smit-McPhee (The Power of the Dog) making his professional stage debut as the tormented Konstantin.Helming the production is Thomas Ostermeier, the artistic director of Berlin’s Schaubühne and a leading light of European theatre, who last year staged a reimagining of Ibsen’s An Enemy of the People, starring Matt Smith, in London’s West End. Ostermeier first met Blanchett in 2011, when he took his acclaimed Hamlet (complete with a soil-covered stage) to Sydney, where she and Upton were then co-directors and CEOs of the SydneyTheatreCompany.Ostermeier remembers that first meeting vividly: “I was blown away when someone called me to say ‘Cate Blanchett wants to meet you.’ I was close to peeing my pants on my way to her house in the taxi. Then we stayed in contact and always wanted to work together.”View image in fullscreenLook who’s back … Cate Blanchett and Thomas Ostermeier.Photograph: Manuel Vazquez/The GuardianWe meet at teatime, the end of rehearsals for the day, with Blanchett on one side of a kitchen table and Ostermeier, ever the director, seated at a remove, as if overseeing proceedings. She, in trouser suit, gusts from remote to warm to cold again while he, rangy in casuals and baseball cap, is more smiley and unguarded. Together they are an intense presence, engaged and earnest, with a stilted sense at first that they are performing for each other: the actor and the auteur, in a conversational continuum from the rehearsal room upstairs.This Seagull is a modern version by Ostermeier and Duncan Macmillan (with whom he co-adapted The Enemy of the People) where characters swear and vape. Arkadina, in the script, “loves applause and chiffon” and Konstantin feels desperately overshadowed by his mother’s celebrity. How does Blanchett find her way into playing a character so seemingly self-regarding, even unlikable? “By not using those adjectives. Just putting them to one side … That term ‘unlikable’ – we’re all unlikable, we’re all absurd.” Does Blanchett like the character, then? “I think you have to love them [the characters], which is different. I love my children [she has three sons and a daughter with Upton] but I don’t always like what they do. All of the characters have warts. You have to love them enough to show those bits.”Is it easier to prepare for the part of an actor though, as an actor herself? “I guess so but there’s the cliche of what an actor is. I’m not an actor who makes decisions about what I’m going to do before I get on the floor … The temptation is that you can hide behind the mask of what an actress is meant to be and not confront yourself with who you are as an actor.”It’s follow-spot theatre, where the lead actress or actor is slightly more brightly lit. You used the word ‘cynical’Ostermeier has returned to The Seagull repeatedly, staging it at the Schaubühne only two years ago. Ironically, he is not the biggest fan of the play, he says, but it is an opportunity to gather “a great group of actors”. He certainly feels no reverence towards Chekhov’s vision. “You need to say, ‘Ja, you’re Chekhov, one of the greatest, of course you are, but I don’t need to do another religious bow in front of your altar. I need to wrestle with you, I need to play with you and fight with you.’”It is not a surprising statement from a former enfant terrible, who hit the headlines in 2001 after saying that any director over the age of 40 should retire for being out of touch. Konstantin says exactly that in his play. Given that Ostermeier is now 56, is he poking fun at his younger self through that line?View image in fullscreenCate Blanchett and Thomas Ostermeier.Photograph: Manuel Vazquez/The Guardian“I’m constantly trying to make fun of myself. That’s not the only self-referential moment [in the play],” he says, and points me to Konstantin’s rants about modern theatre being overpriced, elitist, indulgent and irrelevant. You imagine Konstantin might complain about the glut of celebrity-led vehicles, too, which are increasingly dominating West End billboards, from Nichole Scherzinger and Sigourney Weaver to Brie Larson currently in Elektra. Present company excepted, of course, is this cynical stunt-casting designed to extract big bucks from people paying to see their screen idols in the flesh? Ostermeier jumps to the defence of his production. “The actors involved in this show all auditioned for it [except Blanchett] and they were simply the best coming out of those auditions.”Blanchett is thoughtful about the broader picture: “As long as theatre does not become homogenous. It’s about how that person is used and whether their celebrity is harnessed to the cart of the production in a positive way, because sometimes that can really work. But it’s the follow-spot theatre that you’re talking about, where the lead actress or actor is slightly more brightly lit than others … You used the word ‘cynical’. I think you can smell that.”The Seagull is produced by Wessex Grove, who brought An Enemy of the People to the West End as well as Andrew Scott’s one-man Vanya, and A Little Life, starring James Norton. Ben Lowy, one part of the duo who founded the company alongside Emily Vaughan-Barratt, later speaks of the “deep history in England of great actors ‘coming back to their roots,’” while Vaughan-Barratt vouches for the rigorous casting process in this show. Despite Ostermeier’s work internationally, this is only his second English-language production. He has a relatively limited knowledge of British acting talent as a result, Vaughan-Barratt says, and that contains its own purity. “Last year [for An Enemy of the People] he auditioned Paul Hilton, a stalwart of British stage and screen who starred alongside Amy Adams in theWest End’s revival of The Glass Menagerietwo years ago and couldn’t believe how brilliant he was. I was trying to explain how he was one of the best stage actors of our time. To him, it was a cold audition …”Neither Blanchett nor Ostermeier grew up in households with theatre running in the blood. It wasn’t affordable for Blanchett’s single mother (her father died when she was 10) or for Ostermeier’s working-class household in Bavaria. “I’m always sad because I know my parents, who are both dead now, could not have afforded to come [to the Schaubühne],” he says. “Even if they were in Berlin they could not have come. I still have in my head how my mother, every evening, after the dishes were done, would sit in the kitchen like this,” he says, and mimes scribbles numbers on paper.“The money,” says Blanchett.“Yes, every evening, and then it was like: ‘Oh, OK, we have this much left until the end of the week.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

The theatre group was the only place I felt safe and valued for what I am.”Blanchett, meanwhile, was always getting people to sit down and watch stuff that she had made as a child. She went to a music school in Melbourne where she was encouraged to keep doing it. “We had an amazing drama teacher. It was really messy and it felt circus-like, with all the girls who didn’t fit into other groups, all the mis-matched ragamuffins. We just made stuff, and when you make people laugh it’s quite addictive.View image in fullscreenTheatre is not always dangerous enough … Cate Blanchett and director Thomas Ostermeier.Photograph: Manuel Vazquez/The Guardian“But I never, ever, ever thought it was something I would do, or that I could do, that one did with one’s life,” she continues. “I was doing it for fun, and then I was going to go and get a proper job. This is where it’s a vocation I think – it sounds very precious these days when you say that – but in the sense that I didn’t pursue it, it pursued me. Someone suggested I try out for drama school and I did, kind of as a dare, and I got in.”She studied fine arts and economics before that and thought she might get into arts curation, “so I’d be around artists”. In fact, she still dabbles in art now – “I’m not a painter. I doodle, I do ceramics,” she says, almost under her breath, “and nothing that I show people because it’s not [about] the outcome.”Konstantin, in the play, rails against his mother’s brand of middlebrow entertainment, speaking of finding new, experimental forms on the stage. What is the purpose of theatre for Blanchett and Ostermeier? “I love vaudeville, I also love Sarah Kane,” says Blanchett. “It’s not an either/or thing. I love dangerous theatre and it is not always dangerous enough but I’ve made the type of theatre that Konstantin is levelling his criticisms at, too. It’s not like it’s always alive but you do strive for that.”The moment that theatre tells us that rightwing thinking is OK is the moment to leave the countryThomas OstermeierFor Ostermeier, it is about examining human behaviour rather than messaging. “We all know we live in terrible times and I don’t want to see any director telling me what to think about any conflict in the world now, because we would possibly agree, anyway. The moment that theatre tells us that rightwing thinking is OK is the moment to leave the country. This hasn’t happened so far but I’m waiting for it.”It has come perilously close in Germany by the sounds of it: the rightwing party, AfD, “are the only party that have a clearly explicit programme on the politics of culture”, he says, and explains how it has tried to censor the Schaubühne in the past, taking a politically charged show byFalk Richter, called Fear, to court. The AfD ultimately lost the case but “we were terrified” all the same, he says. The party’s rising prominence extended its reach last month to Elon Musk, whoendorsed the AfD as Germany’s “best hope”.Trump might be charged with attempting to capture people through art and culture, too; doesn’t his recent appointment of special Hollywood ambassadors (Sylvester Stallone, Jon Voight and Mel Gibson) seem like a bid to Make Hollywood Great Again? What does Blanchett make of it? “It is exactly what it seems it is, it’s McCarthyism. We’re repeating history.”Curtain up! Meet the new artistic directors with great plans for British theatreRead moreHollywood is less a place than a state of mind, she says, and she seems to have found a healthy distance from it, straddling her time between Los Angeles, Australia and East Sussex. She will always continue doing theatre alongside the screen work, she says. “Of course, I had a film career by default!”Ostermeier is also immersed in both forms, having directed as well as acted in films. Which medium do they prefer, ultimately?“Film,” he says. “It’s more working -class.”“Theatre,” she says in a whisper. “In everything you do, you’re very aware that you’re walking that line with an audience where you’re saying: ‘We’re doing this for you but it is absolutely happening’. Theatre’s like a magic trick. Are you coming with me? Are we going here together?”The Seagull is at Barbican theatre, London, 26 February to 5 April.Explore more on these topicsCate BlanchettTheatreinterviewsShareReuse this content"

But in fact, perhaps more than any other form of animation, stop-motion is a medium that lends itself to darker, more violent themes: the macabre sentient tendrils of Jan Svankmajer’sLittle Otik; the haunted gothic fairytales dreamed up in the imagination of Tim Burton; the chilling pre-teen horror ofCoraline. Add to this list the singular vision of Australian stop-motion animator Adam Elliot (Mary and Max;the Oscar-winning shortHarvie Krumpet), whose tragicomic tales of loneliness, eccentricity and outsider status are told in a glum colour palette that evokes black mould, peeling wallpaper and crushed dreams.Elliot’s latest, the multi-award-winning, Oscar-nominatedMemoir of a Snail,is the sorry tale of a melancholic woman named Grace Pudel, voiced with world-weary resignation bySuccession’sSarah Snook. It’s a catalogue of misfortune: Grace’s mother dies in childbirth; she and her twin brother, Gilbert (Kodi Smit-McPhee), are orphaned when their depressive, alcoholic father succumbs to his sleep apnoea. And then things getreallybad. Grace, like the pet snails she counts among her closest friends, just wants to crawl into her shell and hide from the world.It’s bleak, certainly. But what makes this a distinctively Elliot film is not the relentless misfortune but the flashes of mordant humour to be found alongside Grace’s hoarded knick-knacks, and the care with which the director handles his damaged, cherished social outcasts.In UK and Irish cinemasWatch a trailer for Memoir of a Snail.Explore more on these topicsAnimation in filmThe ObserverSarah SnookEric BanareviewsShareReuse this content"

Similarly, the pasta shouldn’t taste plasticky; the closer it is to homemade, the better.I tested all these tortelloni with unsalted butter, side by side in batches, to give an accurate comparison of the seasoning. Almost all of them benefited from a couple of minutes less than the recommended cooking time when tested a second time.Bestall-rounder:M&S spinach & ricotta tortelloniView image in fullscreen£2.30 for 300g at Ocado★★★★★A really well-seasoned filling, with great texture and flavour.

Otherwise, they’re well-seasoned and not stodgy, with a nice, light texture. The pasta tastes a little mass-produced, but it’s basically fine.

It certainly doesn’t work for the kind of procrastination that has obstructed my best life: swerving that relationship I craved; postponing for years a book on the philosophy of love that I yearned to write before finally putting pen to paper; failing to pursue the hobby – piano playing – to which I’ve been devoted since childhood, while my piano sat in a corner, closed and silent.Play is entirely consistent with hard work and ambitionIt’s no use being told by self-help books to formulate my top priorities when I already have core goals that define who I am or want to become. Or to be urged to break up tasks into bite-sized steps, with a deadline for each step, because how does that work when it’s a relationship or a vocation that I’m avoiding? Conventional advice says I should forgive myself my paralysis rather than beating myself up about it but, soothing as this is, it doesn’t magically give me either the focus or the energy I need to fulfil those prized goals. I can remove external distractions, especially online access, but what am I to do about distractions inside my head: fantasising, say, about a holiday or a romance as an escape from the task in hand?When the philosopher Augustine (354–430 AD) begged God to grant him “chastity and self-control, but not yet,” he, too, wouldn’t have been helped by, say, Cal Newport’s core recommendations inSlow Productivity: “Do fewer things”, “Work at a natural pace”, and “Obsess over quality”. Augustine knew exactly what his top priority was: to abandon sensual pleasures for a life of total devotion to God. His problem wasn’t doing too many things, a manic work schedule or poor quality. Rather it was that he couldn’t unleash his inner motivation to live his best life. And so he was putting it off, helped by procrastination’s crucial illusions: that deferral is always temporary and that nothing decisive will be lost by it.When it comes toavoiding, resisting, even sabotaging our highest priorities, we need a very different approach to conquering procrastination. First off, let’s realise that a priority’s very significance – it is our ticket to a meaningful life and self-esteem – can paralyse and overwhelm us. So why not imaginatively lower its stakes and think of it instead as our favoured displacement activity, there to sneak off and have fun with while we sideline everything else?Then let’s reimagine our priority not as grim slavery to a maximally successful life, as if we’re machines to be optimised for efficient productivity, but rather as play. By play I mean an explorative, joyful mindset by which to loosen those paralysed cogs of our mind, releasing it from servitude to the managerial dullness of the to-do list mentality and allowing it to move nimbly. Play is a way of becoming open to new ways forward, new ideas, surprise. It’s entirely consistent with clear goals, tight focus, hard work and ambition. Which is surely why, historically, the spirit of play has catalysed so many innovations, from 9th-century Baghdad, where far-sighted engineering breakthroughs were developed that, centuries later, fuelled the west’s industrial revolutions, right up to today’s digital and AI revolutions. It’s why corporations such as Google and Nvidia cultivate an environment of free-wheeling exploration. When dull, dutiful routine is bogging us down, the spirit of play can be just what’s needed to break the logjam.But if neither the spirit of play nor lowering the stakes of our priorities suffices, then it’s time to harness the creative power of regret and boredom – two emotions abundantly created by procrastination and often, wrongly, seen as entirely negative. Yes, they can further paralyse us procrastinators, corroding our self-esteem and wasting our one shot at living. But sometimes the message they’re sending us isn’t to try again and try harder. Rather it’s that our ambitions are unsuited to us, even when they’re strongly held. Or that how we’re pursuing them is unthinking and ossified by routine. Or that we’re not yet ready for them; for it can be perilous to come too early to, say, our vocation or an important relationship. In other words, regret and boredom can turn procrastination into a blessing: a rebellion against stale priorities and soulless routines; a life-giving refusal, arising deep within us, to go on as before.The 19th-century philosopherSøren Kierkegaarddescribes how regret fuelled, but was eventually key to resolving, the greatest dilemma of his life: whether or not to marry Regine Olsen, whom he loved. One of history’s great amorous procrastinators, Kierkegaard discovered he would regret it if he married Regine and regret it if he didn’t. No sooner had she accepted his proposal, after a three-year courtship, than he panicked. Gradually, however, his regret afforded him deeper insight into who he was, propelling him to the wrenching decision to forgo the woman he loved for his vocation as a writer – a vocation he came to believe was incompatible with the duties and responsibilities of marriage. He learned how regret’s clarifying pain – its tremendous power to make vivid to the mind’s eye what is lost by pursuing one life priority over another – can impel us to choose and then to live our choice authentically and to the full.What, however, if we successfully choose a course in life, or accomplish a long-cherished priority, yet we soon feel empty, unfulfilled? We’re besieged by that fatal little question, “So what?” – fatal for procrastination because it leeches all motivation, as the great Russian writer Leo Tolstoy discovered at age 50, already world-famous and with timeless novels likeAnna KareninaandWar and Peaceunder his belt. “Well, fine,” the question whispered to him, “so you will be more famous than Gogol, Pushkin, Shakespeare, Molière, more famous than all the writers in the world, and so what?” In the face of inevitable death, Tolstoy agonised, what is the greatest success worth?If that question can paralyse a driven superachiever like Tolstoy, it can paralyse any of us. How then can we recover our motivation?To start with, by abandoning our expectation of stable fulfilment. The reality is that fulfilment – like most pleasure – is temporary. Our memory is remarkably poor at retaining the experience of it. Nor can we ever know – as the “So what?” question assumes we can – what exactly our achievements add up to or how and whether they’ll endure. Like Tolstoy, none of us can sum the net value of the meanings, delights, fulfilled desires and other outcomes we’ve secured on justoneof our top priorities, say being a writer, a parent or a charity worker. Let alone across all of our top priorities.We can’t even know to what extent we’ve fulfilled our potential, because the very idea that we each have a fixed potential waiting to be fulfilled (or, even if we do, that we could know when we’ve attained it) is probably an illusion.What really matters are the delights of the journey. Shakespeare’s Cressida surely expresses this when she says: “Things won are done; joy’s soul lies in the doing”; as does a remark attributed to Confucius: “Roads are made for journeys, not destinations.” A well-lived life is one where we richly employ our energies and talents in theactivityof pursuing those ends we most cherish.In life, what really matters are the delights of the journeyWhat then of death annulling all our achievements, which was at the heart of Tolstoy’s paralysing nightmare? How do we stop that thought from miring us in procrastination? The answer, ironically, is by diving deeper into death’s reality. Here we need to learn from the experience of so many of the incurably ill who, alongside fearful uncertainty, discover thrillingly fresh vitality, clarity of purpose and joy in life, whether in its most routine moments or its largest priorities. These brave people teach us that nothing can commit us more powerfully and meaningfully to the people and projects we love than truly experiencing ourselves as mortal.But this requires us to go far beyond “mere acceptance that we’ll eventually die”, transience, or the shocking brevity of even a long lifespan – acceptance that remains too abstract to motivate us more than sporadically. Instead we need to attain a deep awareness that death can arriveat any moment.To achieve this awareness, those of us who have no experience of a terrible diagnosis will need to use that most powerful of all motivators: our imagination. For the most vivid possible relationship to our mortality is the key to rediscovering the living force of our hopes and commitments, and so to conquering procrastination.High time, therefore, for me to get back to the piano. To reimagine it as my favoured displacement activity. To enjoy it as disciplined, goal-driven free play. To learn from my boredom with my own playing. To delight in the beauty of sound right now. And above all, to realise that life could be over in just a minute.Jump! A New Philosophy for Conquering Procrastination by Simon May is published by Basic Books at £16.99 on 25 February.

As well as a mother of four.Marie defines her style as “boho wild”, and there is perhaps no better definition of it than this home full of reassuring objects, soft and dusty colours, vintage design gems and joyful chaos.View image in fullscreenOne of the walls in the living room painted by artist Mirja Ilkka. Others are left untouched ‘because it’s a great background for photos’.Photograph: Monica Spezia/Living InsideThe large Swedish apartment in Helsingborg, a small town in the south of Sweden, close to Denmark, is her latest creation. She lives here with her husband, William, and their children.What struck her most about the house when she first saw it were “the windows, the entrance, the vaulted parts with the balcony. The whole feeling that this place gave back immediately drew me in. I think this flat is my destiny.”Marie had been looking for somewhere to live in the area for a year and had already seen the building, which she had always liked. “It’s in a very special area in the city centre. I knew the owner of the building a bit, so I sent him an email to see if there was anything available. We were lucky, because just the day before this flat had become vacant.”View image in fullscreen‘I think this flat is my destiny’: Marie Olsson Nylander and pet in the master bedroom.Photograph: Monica Spezia/Living InsideIt is a typical apartment from the end of the 19th century (it was built in 1884), consisting of a “parade” of large living rooms for entertaining and then another section, used as a sleeping area, with the bedrooms and servants’ quarters, the kitchen with its own entrance and a small room for the maid.When it came to refurbishment and decorating, some of the walls were painted by her artist friend Mirja Ilkka from Helsinki, while she left others untouched, “because it’s a great background for photos. And leaving them like that allows us, if we want to one day, to paint them, as we have done for many other walls in the house. But I did do the ceilings. It would have been too much to leave those bare, too, in this big room.”Much of the furniture is secondhand or antique, but it always has to be comfortable – demonstrated by the super-furry carpets and the many cosy seats. “I wish I had 30 flats, so I could furnish them all,” she says. “I see a piece of furniture and suddenly I’ll imagine a room, or even a whole house, that could accommodate it. I am very fast,” she adds. “I often know immediately what to wear, what to do… And if I don’t know, most of the time it means I’m not interested.”View image in fullscreenRetro tulip chairs in the kitchen.Photograph: Monica Spezia/Living InsideHer home, she explains, is a mix of everything she loves. “The carpets, for example. The house is my project: so many things fit together, as if following an invisible thread, without me thinking much about it. I love furniture – old classics, vintage and new furniture by unknown designers. All objects that I find beautiful, attractive and that deserve a second chance.“I love our bedroom with the bow window,” she continues. “It’s very warm and light, it’s bright. I love spending time there, even for work, sitting on one of the leather chairs.Most of all, Marie loves the colour pink: “It has to be a dirty, dusty pink with a hint of black. It’s nice in combination with brown or olive green, for example, because it makes both colours stand out. But I don’t wear a lot of pink, I prefer it on home textiles and cushions.”View image in fullscreenMarie Nylander loves ‘a dirty, dusty pink with a hint of black’, as seen in the bedroom.Photograph: Monica Spezia/Living InsideA free spirit who loves to collect vintage pieces and rarities, an all-round creative who loves shades of colour and the softness of fabrics, Marie is interested in cracks in walls rather than perfect surfaces – it’s in the gaps of life that she finds her sense of beauty.“I love creating spaces, rooms and houses. I am a woman who works hard and takes nothing for granted. ‘Never give up’ is my mantra. My style is mine; it’s difficult to describe. But if I had to list some of my cornerstones, they would be that I prefer unique pieces and scenic arrangements and if, for example, I need a cushion, I don’t like to buy any – rather, I make it myself.”Explore more on these topicsInteriorsThe ObserverHomesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Share the story of your sex life, anonymouslyAs told to Olivia LadanyiSat 15 Feb 2025 07.00 ESTShareStella, 31When I looked at the body of his favourite porn star I felt insecure and started cryingWhen Gabriel and I first met, a year and a half ago, we were living in different countries. I was in a fallow period, and hadn’t had sex in months, but we slept together for the first time the next day. I don’t remember much about the sex – but I remember telling him I was out of practice.Whenever I visited him, we’d have sex late into the night, skipping all the plans we’d made. When we were apart, we’d send each other videos of touching ourselves and share links to our favourite porn. But when I looked at the body of his favourite porn star I felt insecure and started crying, so that was the last time we did that.Seven and a half months in, Gabriel moved to my city so we could be together. He didn’t feel confident in his new surroundings, and we soon fell into a pattern of having less sex. I discovered that how good he feels about himself is closely connected to his sex drive. Whereas I don’t think my self-confidence level has that much effect on my own sex drive.I miss feeling his hands on me in the night telling me he wants me, rather than I’m taking up too much room on his side of the bedI crave physical connection when I’m feeling insecure, which can cause a disconnect. When I’m seeking validation, I need Gabriel to show he’s sexually attracted to me by taking the lead, but if he’s not in the headspace for it we end up in a stalemate, where neither of us feels desired by the other.In an effort to spice things up, he bought straps to tie me up in bed, which lay hanging from the mattress for months after, like a ghoulish reminder that we weren’t having the kinky sex we hoped we would. We now have sex about once a week, but can go weeks without either of us initiating. Sometimes, I just want to be objectified. I miss feeling his hands on me in the night and telling me he wants me, rather than I’m encroaching on his side of the bed.I used to wait for him to initiate and I’d get frustrated when he didn’t, but now if I feel like we need to connect, I light candles or get out the massage oil. I’ve said that I’d like to have more sex in 2025, so I’m hopeful that this year will bring a deeper understanding of our desires.Share your experienceIf you’re keen to talk to us about your sex lives you can get in touch by filling in the form below.

What started as a holiday hookup soon became meaningful. I’d been single for seven months and was dating a lot, but I was failing to find much intimacy. There was a vulnerability about Stella, which made me feel attracted and close to her from the start.I’d done long distance before but it was nothing like this; I’d never had phone sex or exchanged such explicit nudes. Stella led the way, encouraging a more open version of sexuality that felt new to me. I admired her boldness and felt emboldened to reveal more of myself. It felt safe but still exciting.Sex with Stella is always hot and adventurous without feeling contrivedWe spent the first seven months in this rhythm, building up anticipation for the next time we would see each other. When we’d reunite, we would try to squeeze in as much sex as possible to make up for the droughts.Looking back, this dynamic probably set us up for disappointment down the line, but sex with Stella is always hot and adventurous without feeling contrived. We’re still finding new ways to express ourselves in the bedroom, though perhaps less regularly than when we first started living together a year ago.I mainly put this down to my libido, which can fluctuate depending on the current health of our relationship, as well as my own mental state. When my life feels out of balance, I’m that insecure kid again, which makes me feel unattractive and not up for having sex. It’s probably a form of self-flagellation, too; like I’m undeserving of intimacy if I’ve been unproductive or have not taken care of myself. Stella gives me space and support at these times, knowing that adding pressure would only make things worse. It’s this mutual vulnerability and closeness that made me fall in love with her in the first place.Explore more on these topicsSexThis is how we do itRelationshipsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

In fact, around83% of womenget pregnant within the first 12 months after coming off the pill. Why, then, do69% ofcollege students worry that it’ll affect their future fertility?“The pill masks changes in your natural cycle. So when you stop taking it, you may see symptoms that indicate shortened cycles or painful periods,” says Dr Danielle Lane, an obstetrician and gynaecologist, fertility specialist and medical director at Lane Fertility Institute in California. These are often mistaken for side effects of coming off the pill.In reality, the pill can reduce the risk and slow the progression of endometriosis and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Many people don’t realise that they have a condition that affects their fertility until they stop taking the pill and the symptoms are no longer masked.Infertility is a female problemFALSEAround 17%of adults(one in six) experience infertility, meaning they don’t conceive after 12 or more months of regular unprotected sex. And there’s “male factor fertility” – problems related to sperm, sperm production and the reproductive tract – present inaround 50%of these cases.“This means that men should be evaluated as a part of a fertility assessment and women should not be treated until their partners have been seen,” Lane says. “Since women carry pregnancies, we often think of fertility as a female problem. This results in tremendous guilt and stress in women  who feel that they are solely responsible for not conceiving.”View image in fullscreenIllustration: Lisa Sheehan/The GuardianWomen’s fertility drops off a cliff when they hit 35FALSE“Fertility decreases every year but there isn’t a fertility cliff that women fall off at age 35,” says Eve Feinberg, professor of obstetrics and gynaecology at Northwestern University, Illinois. “There’s a steeper decline at age 38 and again after 40, but none of these are cliffs.”It’s more of a gradual slope. For women aged 30-34 with no known history of infertility, endometriosis or PCOS,one studyfound that the chance of getting pregnant is 87%. For 35-40 year-olds it’s 76%; and for 40-41 year-olds its 53% .Men’s fertility declines with ageTRUE“Some men can continue to father children into old age – look at Charlie Chaplin and Mick Jagger. However, not all men remain so fertile,” according to Kevin McEleny, consultant urologist atNewcastle Fertility Centre.Dr Sami Almusawa, medical director and fertility consultant at thePlan Your Babytelehealth clinic says: “Sperm quality – including motility (movement), morphology (shape) and DNA integrity –deteriorates over time. Testosterone levels also gradually decline from around age 30, impacting sperm production.” Plus, as men get older, there’s an increased risk of genetic abnormalities. Almusawa adds: “Although men in their 40s, 50s or beyond can still father children, conception may take longer, and there is a higher risk of miscarriage or complications.”IVF has low success ratesTRUE and FALSE“In women under the age of 35, success rates can be quite high (more than 50-60% per cycle) depending on the specific diagnosis and the embryology lab used,” Lane says. “However, in women over the age of 40 success rates can be low (less than 10% per cycle).” So the biggest predictor of success in most IVF cases is the age of the egg.The average age of someone undergoing IVF is now36, compared with 31for those conceiving naturally. Lane says delaying treatment and thinking of IVF as an easy solution is a problem. “IVF was originally designed to bypass fallopian tubes that were blocked either by disease or tubal ligation (contraception),” she says. “It was not designed to address age-related fertility, endometriosis and other causes such as fibroids and polyps.” Although she has seen IVF work for people in their mid-40s, “it required multiple rounds and these women had genetically high egg counts to begin with. While this is amazing, it shouldn’t be assumed that IVF will be successful in this age group.”You can get pregnant if you have sex on your periodTRUE (but unlikely)“For most people, the chance of pregnancy is close to zero in the first couple of days of menstruation when bleeding is heaviest. But the risk increases with each successive day, particularly for those with shorter cycles,” says Dr Ippokratis Sarris, a consultant in reproductive medicine atKing’s College hospital, London. “If someone has unprotected sex towards the end of their period, sperm could survive long enough to fertilise an egg released during early ovulation.”For those who are trying to avoid pregnancy, the misconception that menstruation and fertility are mutually exclusive “creates a false sense of reassurance that it’s entirely safe to have unprotected sex during this time”. And if you’re trying to conceive? Having sex during your period is unlikely to lead to pregnancy. Sarris says you’ll have more luck on the most fertile days of the cycle: “The three to four days leading up to ovulation and including the day of ovulation itself.”Tight underwear makes men infertileFALSE“Tight underwear can slightly increase scrotal temperature which may negatively affect sperm production and motility,” Almusawa says. Some studies have found that heat exposure, such as taking hot baths or saunas, canimpair sperm production, which is why there’s a theory that tight pants may have the same effect. “However, the impact is generally minimal compared to other factors such as lifestyle, diet, smoking or medical conditions.”While switching to looser underwear may benefit sperm health, it won’t resolve significant fertility issues. “In my practice, I’ve had patients overly focused on external factors like underwear while neglecting the more substantial contributors to infertility.”Egg freezing doesn’t guarantee a future pregnancyTRUEWith a64% risein egg freezing between 2019 and 2022, Feinberg has noticed an over-reliance on “social egg freezing” (storing the eggs of a healthy and fertile person so they can have a pregnancy later in life). “The success of egg freezing is tied to several critical factors: how old a person is when they freeze their eggs, how many eggs they get, the skill of the embryologist freezing the eggs, the specific protocol used and a person’s overall health when the embryo is being transferred back,” she says.Amy Klein, author ofThe Trying Game: Get Through Fertility Treatment and Get Pregnant Without Losing Your Mind,and who started IVF treatment at 41, agrees. “While it’s far from a guarantee, in my personal and professional opinion, if you can afford it [the process can cost up to£8,000], you should do it by age 35,” she says. “If I’d had 35-year-old eggs, my journey to have a baby – 10 doctors, nine rounds of IVF and four miscarriages – might have been less protracted.”But remember, the actual egg freezing is only one part of the equation. “You don’t know what could go wrong,” Klein adds. “The eggs might not thaw, fertilise or make healthy embryos.”Acupuncture helps you conceivePARTLY TRUEAlternative therapiesdo not directly influence the likelihoodof getting pregnant. Feinberg says: “Often people will add in therapies such as acupuncture, after they have been in fertility treatment for a while. Then when treatment works they make the incorrect association that it was due to the add-ons and not the original therapy.”She does, however, believe acupuncture can have indirect benefits. “The biggest barrier to fertility treatment success is dropping out of treatment. Alternative therapies can help patients to feel cared for mentally, and can keep them in treatment, which ultimately leads to higher success.” Perhaps most importantly, acupuncturemay reduce stress. One study found women with fertility issuesexperienced the same stress levelsand symptoms as cancer patients.If youhad a miscarriage youwill struggle to get pregnant againFALSE“The majority of people who experience a miscarriage, who are trying for a baby, will go on to have a healthy pregnancy in the future,” says Vicki Robinson, chief executive atThe Miscarriage Association. People who have had one miscarriage have about a25% chanceof having another, which is only slightly higher than someone who hasn’t had a miscarriage (up to a 20% chance).“Miscarriage can be heartbreaking. Many people associate miscarriage with something ‘being wrong’ with their body, when in most cases there’s a one-off problem with the genetic makeup of the embryo,” she adds – and this is beyond anyone’s control. “However, in some cases, recurrent miscarriage or late miscarriage may indicate an underlying issue that can be investigated by a specialist. No matter your situation, you don’t have to go through this alone.”The vaginal microbiome plays a vital role in fertilityFALSEVaginal microbiota, or vaginal flora, are the microorganisms present in the vagina thatplay a crucial rolein protecting it from disease. Enter an explosion of at-home vaginal microbiome tests promising to identify imbalances and improve fertility, costing up to £250. “Some studies suggest that identifying and treating microbial imbalances might improve fertility, particularly for those undergoing assisted reproductive technologies,” says Sarris. “But most of the evidence is limited and comes from clinical studies conducted under a research setting, rather than over-the-counter tests.”Sarris is concerned about the accuracy, regulation and commercial motivations surrounding these tests. “I frequently come across patients in my practice who have purchased and performed them at home. They rarely provide actionable insights and often create anxiety.” Likewise, he says the vaginal probiotics advertised on social media that claim to treat imbalances and improve fertility lack robust clinical validation.“Intervening with your vaginal microbiome based on flawed tests, then using equally flawed treatments (such as commercialised and unvalidated probiotics), may lead to a worsening of whichever condition you’re trying to cure or avoid in the first place,” Sarris says. “Consulting healthcare professionals for fertility issues is always recommended.”Explore more on these topicsLife and styleFertility problemsWomen's healthMen's healthHealthfeaturesShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Walk into any big UK supermarket, and somewhere between the pasta and pet food you’ll find an aisle stacked with seductively stylish yet affordable homeware. From tableware to throws, cushions to coasters, objets d’art to duvet covers, the shelves will be teeming with everything you could possibly need to furnish your home – all in the latest shades and styles, and most costing less than the price of a takeaway.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Just a few years ago, this would have seemed strange, but with Asda, Sainsbury’s and Tesco all launching own-brand homeware ranges in the past decade, and the expansion of Lidl and Aldi, both known for their “middle aisle” bargains, purchasing homewares during the weekly shop has become the new normal.“If there were bits and bobs that could be bought, I would buy them,” admits Scottish former cheap homeware addict Carol Murdoch, 42. “You’d go shopping for a loaf of bread and come home with a candle.“It took doing my master’s in sustainability for me to actually look at it, and go: ‘We’re being completely conned here,’” says the former teacher, and director at an outdoor learning company. “As much as I now go, ‘Blooming heck!’, I did it – I bought homeware, all the time, without giving it a second thought.”In recent years, fast fashion has faced a reckoning – in part due to theRana Plaza disaster in 2013, in which 1,134 people were killed and at least another 2,000 injured when a factory collapsed in Bangladesh. The garment workers inside – who operated in sweatshop conditions, earning less than $2 (£1.60) a day – made clothes for big name high street retailers, including Primark and Matalan. Since then, a slew of initiatives – fromsustainable fashion weektoSecond Hand September– have changed how many of us buy and think about clothes.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Ilka & Franz/The GuardianYet, at the same time, the ever-growing fast homeware industry has slipped under the radar. According to market and consumer data provider Statista, the UK homeware market has “expanded substantially” in the past decade. Business intelligence platform GlobalData estimates the industry wasworth £14.32bn in 2023, with discount sellers witnessing the strongest growth, and key retailers including Dunelm, B&M, Ikea, The Range, Amazon and John Lewis.The homeware market began to speed up in the years after the second world war, when brands such as Ercol – whose original designs are now highly sought-after as vintage pieces – began mass-producing modern, affordable furniture. By the 1970s, Ikea was expanding worldwide, opening its first UK store in 1987. Throughout the 1990s, production continued to grow. When Urban Outfitters arrived in the UK in 1998, it changed the game again; highly curated, trend-led homewares and gifts mingled with shoes and clothes. It was selling a lifestyle, and it wasn’t long before the rest of the high street caught on.Zara Home was launched in 2003. It may have been the first fast fashion chain to add a dedicated homewares line, but it was far from the last. In 2009, H&M Home entered the market, and by the 2020s Primark and hyper-fast online brands such as Boohoo, Pretty Little Things and Shein had followed suit.The similarities between the fashion and homewares industries is no coincidence. Interior designer Helen Gordon – who has since co-founded regenerative interior design and build studioNested Living, and sits on the British Institute of Interior Design’s sustainability committee – witnessed this first-hand as a retail buyer for high street homewares brands in the early 2000s.We need to slow down and start thinking about how we value things – why we’re buying something, where it has come from and who has made it“It was very much about looking and understanding what fashion did, to make it the same,” she says. Although Gordon loved her job as a buyer, she grew increasingly uncomfortable with the hidden human cost.“You’re going toChina, and in the factories you’re seeing people who only see their families for two weeks a year, when it’s Chinese new year, and they’re in a dormitory, lights go out at 9 o’clock, there’s no electricity after that. That’s their life,” she says. “It’s all ethical, quality standard, big companies I was working with, but it really hits you when you go there and you see it.”Six years into her career, Gordon’s misgivings about the high street’s business practices crystalised when the company she was working for went bust, with shocking consequences.“Suppliers were left with already made stock and substantial unpaid invoices. There was always a clear power dynamic, with us as the retailer often in the driving seat, but this imbalance became particularly evident during this difficult time,” she says. “Not long after we went into administration, one of our suppliers in the far east tragically took his own life. As the primary liaison, I felt a deep sense of responsibility; they’re our friends, our suppliers. I couldn’t help but reflect on whether the pressures of working with us had contributed to his situation. From that point on, I just thought: ‘I can’t keep doing this.’ I realised this just wasn’t a sustainable way of working for me.”It’s not just foreign workers who are being exploited. In 2018, Bristol-based ceramicistSarah Wiltondiscovered that Urban Outfitters were selling factory-made pieces apparently copied from her handcrafted designs. Her pieces were part of an exclusive range of 100 hand-thrown plant pots and ornamental vases that she had created for the luxury London department store Liberty.“The collection was unapologetically handmade,” Wilton says. “The motifs were inspired by music and melody, and the forms fused a combination of inspirations from mid-century British ceramic design, Oriental ornamentalism and art nouveau colour palettes.”While each of Wilton’s pieces was unique and retailed for £55 to £100; Urban Outfitters batch-made copies were on sale for £15 to £30.“It crushed me,” says the 36-year-old. “I was working so hard, juggling jobs, serious graft. I had a newfound confidence in the stuff I was making, I had been picked up by Liberty and featured in American Vogue. But then, very swiftly, it was followed by the Urban Outfitters incident. I felt totally robbed.”With the help of friends and mentors, Wilton sought legal advice and created a storm on social media. In response, Urban Outfittersissued a statement, saying: “We take intellectual property very seriously, both in protecting what has been developed by our own artists and designers, and also respecting the intellectual property and designs of others. Out of deference to the artist Sarah Wilton, we have removed the vase in question from stock.”However, Wilton says the situation was never fully resolved to her liking: “I had some evidence of units sold, but received no receipt of units made, and no receipt of the destruction of remaining items. They did, in fact, continue to sell them after the initial dispute was resolved – followers shared this with me and I had to repeat the process. They may well have sold remaining units to other wholesalers, as this is fairly common practice and has happened to artists and makers I know.”Unfortunately for independent makers such as Wilton, high-end looks for low prices is exactly the appeal for many shoppers.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Ilka & Franz/The Guardian“I know dupes are frowned upon, but I love that people are able to have the affordability of the pieces they like,” says interiors influencer Ellie Fenlon, who has more than 100k followers and subscribers acrossTikTok,InstagramandYouTube, where she posts shopping hauls, trend roundups and styling videos. “Some pieces are an extortionate price, so if brands are able to create it for those with smaller budgets to enjoy, why not?”As well as her eye for an uncanny copy – “when it comes to spotting a dupe, I’m on it, which is why a lot of people follow my accounts” – Fenlon is also known for her visits to her local Homesense store (a subsidiary of TK Maxx), where she worked for six years as a visual merchandiser.“My audience love a ‘come shop with me’,” she says. “I’m in there every single day.”Fenlon also admits she’s “guilty” of loving a seasonal trend – and she’s not alone. While historically Christmas was the only season in which people redecorated their homes, in recent years homewares retailers have created entire ranges to mark everything from Valentine’s Day to Halloween. Asurvey released by YouGov in October 2024found that 19% of UK adults were planning to purchase “autumn decor”, including candles and diffusers, but also new lighting, kitchenware and cushions to mark the season. Unsurprisingly, this trend owes much to social media, with 39% of respondents saying their purchases were inspired by influencers, and 37% by social posts from retailers.“I love the newness and excitement it brings to the homeware game, otherwise it would be boring,” says Fenlon. “Just like having trending pieces in your wardrobe, I also like them in my home.”Murdoch, too, knows the appeal of refreshing your interiors throughout the year, saying: “There is something nice about switching your home up and making it seasonal. I used to have boxes full of seasonal decorations. In spring, I would have little coloured eggs, my pastel-coloured candles and holders, vases, little lambs – ornaments like that. Then, come autumn, I’d pull out my owls – I loved my owls. Winter, you’d be looking at getting the reindeers out and things like that, wintery-themed animals. And then, of course, there were decorations just for Christmas.”If you buy something from a local producer, you know it’s making a difference to somebody’s life. It will last a lifetime and bring you joy for years to comeAs with fast fashion, the environmental impact of our lust for the latest, on-trend homeware is catastrophic. Research commissioned by British pottery brand Denby as part of itsReloved campaignfound that the British throw away about70m homeware items each year, with 35% of people admitting to binning things simply because their tastes have changed. But the amount of waste is not the only problem. Due to the diversity of materials and toxic compounds used, fast homeware is incredibly complex to dispose of – and much is not recyclable.“In terms of the flame retardants we have to use on our cushions and furnishing fabrics, it’s all phthalates, so you can’t just take them to the dump,” explains Gordon. “Then, if it’s chipboard, that’s already rubbish that can’t be recycled, and then it’s laminated over as well. There are these recycling places that have started to come up – like for MDF, there’s one in south Wales that was set up a couple of years ago. But then how do you get your MDF to them?”It’s a problem the industry is aware of, and many big-name brands are actively taking steps to be more transparent with consumers and lessen their impact. As one of the leading names in the industry, Ikea is at the forefront of this with amulti-pronged strategyto transition to a fully sustainable, yet still profitable, business model by 2030. H&M has included detailed information aboutits supply chainfor each item on its website since 2019, and has a line of products under itsMeet the Makerbanner, which are made in collaboration with small-scale artisans around the world.As to how we move forward, Gordon believes we can’t rely on governments or industry alone to drive the change, saying: “I’m very concerned about this idea of greenwashing. There’s a whole world of hidden lobbying going on by people who are trying to keep this industry going, because they know that their company will go under otherwise.”She hopes that raising awareness of the problem will help shift our collective mindset, saying: “Somehow we need to slow down. We need to start thinking about how we value things, and getting back to this whole idea of stories – thinking about why you’re buying something, where it has come from and who has made it.”Murdoch agrees, and hopes that her story will inspire others. “You can go from being somebody like me who has seasonal boxes full of tat, to someone who now actively discourages it,” she says. “Months go by where I don’t buy anything.”Murdoch is not alone in embracing a “less is more” philosophy. Search the term “underconsumption” on social media, and you’ll find thousands of posts celebrating this anti-consumerist ideology, with users sharing tips on upcycling and visible mending, or simply celebrating well-worn pieces they’ve had for years.As Murdoch has learned first-hand, conscious consumption can lead to a sense of satisfaction that more than makes up for the loss of quick-fix dopamine hits. She says: “I adore my wool blankets. They’re now probably 10 years old, and yet I still feel joy when I coorie under them. I didn’t feel that way about the £5 fleece ones from the supermarket that fall apart in two or three years.“Most things we buy don’t have an emotional connection. It’s made no difference, except to the fat cats. Yet if you buy something from a local producer that’s properly handmade, you know it’s making a difference to somebody’s life. It’s something that will last a lifetime, that you’ll be able to pass on. It’s something that will bring you joy for years to come.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Photograph: Lydia Goldblatt/The GuardianMost people with small children are worn out – but for some, the pressure of striving to be perfect parents can drive them to the edgeByDeborah LintonSat 15 Feb 2025 06.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 15 Feb 2025 08.39 ESTShare‘Icried like someone had died,” Rachel Stern says of the day things unravelled at home. “I thought: ‘I can’t do this any more.’ I didn’t want to spend time or play with my children. I was just going through the motions.”It was a Sunday morning in January 2022. Stern’s sons were five and two. She wrote her husband a note – “I just need some space” – asking him to watch them, left their home in Manchester and started walking. “I was inconsolable,” says Stern, now 39. “And it was so shameful to admit that I just couldn’t be with my kids.”Stern was working condensed, full-time hours in a new job as a brand strategist. The family had moved cities during the pandemic, bought and renovated a house, and her eldest had started school four months earlier. She had reached her limit: “I didn’t have the mental capacity to be a mum any more.” She now understands that she was suffering from parental burnout, a syndrome defined by academics as “chronic and overwhelming stress which leads parents to feel exhausted and run down by their role”. At its worst, it can give rise to thoughts of suicide – more so, say researchers, than in cases of job burnout or depression.In a busy, perfectionist world, in which parents are trying to be the very best at home, at work and within their wider families, the term has gained traction, and is the subject of academic study at theParental Burnout Research Labat the University of Louvain in Belgium. Run by academics Moïra Mikolajczak and Isabelle Roskam, the lab has gathered evidence from 30,000 parents worldwide and has created a 23-point questionnaire to help people determine whether their feelings are, overall, balanced or whether there’s cause for concern. Is parental burnout an inevitable symptom of the impossibility of doing and having it all – or a worrying condition we should be taking more seriously?“In reality, it had been going on a long time,” says Stern, who had “always wanted to be a mum” but found her first maternity leave more challenging than she had imagined. “I found the monotony hard. Among other mums, I was the anomaly, saying, ‘I’m not enjoying this, I want to go back to work.’” She then found the jump to two children “unbelievably hard. I’d wanted to give my son a sibling but I’d be on my own with these children all day while my husband worked, and I dreaded it. I was clock-watching. It was constant: ‘I can’t do this, I can’t cope.’”After stepping out of her front door that Sunday morning, she walked the streets for a while before ending up at her parents’ house. She saw a GP, followed by a psychologist, who diagnosed acute stress. She took nine months off work. “My husband had always been hands-on but he picked up more. He did bath and bedtimes or our parents helped. I couldn’t be left alone with the kids, not because anyone feared for their safety; they feared what it would do to me.”Through reading books, researching online what she was feeling and listening to podcasts during that time, she stumbled across the term “parental burnout”. “It was a lightbulb moment,” she says.It’s an intensity of overwhelming exhaustion far beyond anything you’ve imagined. You wake each morning already exhaustedThe term was conceptualised by Roskam and Mikolajczak. Roskam, who herself has five children, noticed a pattern in her clients. “I saw parents coming to a consultation talking about themselves, how they were suffering. Moira wondered: ‘Is there something similar to burnout, but in parents?’” Academically, the term emerged in the 1980s but had only ever been considered in families with severely ill or disabled children. But the pair’s research has found it to be more widespread. Their diagnostic test includes practical questions about whether parents feel they have anyone to share the load with, as well as emotional ones about how much they feel able to handle stress. “We applied a scale, like in job burnout, changing the features to parenting situations.”The syndrome presents as extreme exhaustion and emotional distancing. Roskam describes a “cold parenting, autopilot mode”; a feeling of no longer wanting to parent or getting pleasure from it; and, critically, a sense of not measuring up to the parent they want to be, leading to intense feelings of shame and guilt.Is this different from the everyday fatigue of raising children? Yes, Roskam says. “Every parent feels exhausted at the end of the day, whether you have a lot of children or your children are young; and every parent feels happy once they’re in their beds at night and you have some time for you. But if the next day you wake up with your energy replenished and you are able to see your children and be involved in parenting them again, you are not in burnout. You are, though, if, even with a long and good night’s sleep, you are not able to recover or feel good in your parenting role. It’s not a normal exhaustion but an intensity of overwhelming exhaustion far beyond anything you’ve imagined. You wake each morning already exhausted at the thought of what to do for or with the children.” Parents who are in burnout will also feel they have lost direction, can no longer stand their “mum” or “dad” role and are only able to do the bare minimum for their children.By 2020, Roskam and Mikolajczak had worked with 100 researchers in 40 countries to understand the phenomenon, which is still not taken seriously by some health agencies. While the charityAction for Children recognises and offers advice on parental burnout, theWorld Health Organization categorises burnout as a work-related phenomenon, not a parenting syndrome. The NHS, meanwhile, shares advice on occupational burnout but doesn’t have a page for either that or parental burnout in its A-Z of conditions.The researchers attribute the cause of this particular burnout to a gap between a parent’s resources (family or peer support, health and finances) and the level of demands (number of children, presence, support and relationship with a co-parent, and expectations). They say it’s most prevalent in individualistic societies – Poland, Belgium, the US and Canada among them – where a high value is placed on personal achievement, perfectionism and self-reliance. (The institute does not yet have a research group in the UK.)“In these countries, it’s not enough to be a good mother or father, you have to be thebest,” Roskam says. “It creates discrepancies between the mother you should be and the mother you are, and that’s exhausting.” They have found the prevalence of parental burnout to be lowest in countries including Cameroon, Thailand, Vietnam and Cuba where traditional family bonds are valued and the parental load is more likely to be shared.View image in fullscreen‘If the rhetoric is, yeah, parenting’s hard, then people who are suffering feel they can’t speak up.’Photograph: Lydia Goldblatt/The GuardianIt’s not about wealth, Roskam says. “Low- or middle-income families may have different stressors to one another but it’s the balance [between those resources and demands] that matters.” For example, their research found single parenthood to be a vulnerability factor in Iran, meaning it was more likely to contribute to burnout, but not in Belgium or France where there was more widespread cultural acceptance of single-parent families. And while it may be harder for a single parent or low earner to get a babysitter or go to a restaurant to compensate for stress, a higher-earning parent dealing with poor family or spousal support, bad health or a schedule overloaded in pursuit of perfectionism can also unravel. “The way to prevent and treat burnout is to adjust the balance,” Roskam says.For real-estate agent Alyssa Soto, 47, in Milwaukee, US, it was a compliment from a well-meaning relative that helped her realise she was experiencing burnout. “I remember her saying, ‘Your house is so clean, I could eat off the floor.’ I look back and think: how was I doing this, where was I finding the time? I was working full-time, making dinners and lunches, picking up and dropping off at school, and studying for my real-estate licence. I went to bed late, got up at 5.30am and started again. It was tedious.”Divorced, and with her children then aged 11 and eight, she hit burnout. “My work and home self were separate entities,” Soto says. She had energy for work but not her children. “I fought myself, because how could I feel that way about looking after my children who I worked so hard for?”It was years later that Soto would come across the term parental burnout and recognise her experience. At the time, she felt she had hit rock bottom, soforced herself to make changes. “I taught the kids to do more for themselves – house tasks, help with our dogs, cleaning the yard – and involved their friends’ parents more in picking them up. I realised I didn’t have to do things at 110% to be a good mom. The kids responded just fine.”The syndrome may be a relatively new label but it is not a new experience. “Parental burnout existed before but people were not interested,” Roskam says. Stories of mothers reaching breaking point or even walking out on their families have circulated for decades without their underlying reasons being explored. “My opinion is that mothers were exhausted by their maternal role but no one considered it an important or interesting topic. As soon as we came into a child-centred society, especially after the United Nations Convention on the Rights of a Child was introduced in 1989, the pressure on parents grew.”It’s not just about mothers, of course. Han-Son Lee, who lives in London, is the founder ofDaddiLife, an online fatherhood community with 250,000 members. He sees plenty of posts from men on the topic of parental burnout. “The language is always the same: ‘How do you guys manage this?’ It’s a solution-hunting exercise,” he says. “They’ve reached a cliff edge and are saying it’s unsustainable. The first few responses are always, ‘I’m glad someone said this.’” He adds, “The need and drive for dads to be more involved means they end up burning the candle at both ends. There’s a sense of being a failure if you’re not spending enough time with your children, and it comes with guilt and shame.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

In July 2021 she felt like “one of those cars trapped in an alley, doing three-point turns, unable to get out”, she says. “After I’d fed the kids or they were in school, I’d drive to a friend and just sit there. I thought, ‘I cannot mom any more.’ I had become everyone’s something – tech support, cook, taxi driver – but very little to myself. I loved my children but needed time apart.” When she was in a minor car accident, necessitating a doctor’s checkup, she says, “It was a very small accident, but my neurons were firing. My blood pressure was through the roof. My resilience was low and my stress was high. My doctor said, ‘I think you need to take a break.’”As she recovered, Chew had to let go of the idea that good motherhood equalled perfection. “I think a lot of the cause was the mental stress and expectations we put on ourselves as mothers, wives, sisters, women,” she says.I told everyone: ‘I’m exhausted, I can’t push myself up the hill any more, so I’m just going to sit right here for a bit'She dialled down those expectations. “You can’t walk away from parent-teacher meetings or disagreements with your children, but I told everyone: ‘I’m a little exhausted, I can’t push myself up the hill any more, so I’m just going to sit right here for a bit.’ I told my daughter, who had an exam, ‘I have given you the tools that you need.’” Her husband was supportive: “He told me, ‘You do what you need.’”When she examined what was triggering the feelings, she reassessed those, too. “I muted parent group chats with ‘one-up’ bragging rights and chose when to engage. On social media, I unfollowed a lot of ‘Hey guys, look how impressive I am’ types.”While Chew wishes she had never burnt out, she views it as an awakening. “I wrestled a lot with guilt. I held on to the belief that if so-and-so could do this, why couldn’t I? But when I spoke to my own mother, she told me: ‘Your best is good enough.’”Parents are anxious, lonely, overwhelmingly stressed – and their crisis affects everyone | Emma BeddingtonRead moreRoskam explains that the roots of burnout are the “need to be a good parent … It’s because you’re highly involved in your children.” Before it hits, she says, “you’ve probably been the best parent for several years or months”. But when that becomes untenable, the researchers have found that cortisol levels spike in both parents and children.A 2020 studyby Roskam and Mikolajczak found the presence of hair cortisol – a universally recognised stress biomarker – to be 213% higher in those suffering parental burnout than in other demographically matched parents; the levels are higher than those in chronic pain patients, the researchers say, signifying the extent of distress experienced by these parents. After psychological treatment for the syndrome, the cortisol levels returned to normal.When a parent is in burnout, Roskam says, partners and children often say they “cannot recognise their partner or parent” any more. She adds, “Children often talk about an event: the day their mother asked them to do something and they did not, so she cried and was furious.” It might sound trivial in itself, but it marks the straw that broke the camel’s back. Consequences can be serious:a 2023 academic reviewof 15 years of research into the topic reported a high correlation between violence and burnout, after following 4,450 parents through international studies. “Severe” escape and suicidal ideation were another risk. In 2019, Mikolajczak wrote that parental burnout “strongly and linearly increases the frequency of neglectful and violent behaviours towards one’s children”.In Manchester, Stern put in place changes to prevent burnout returning. “I learned to be OK asking for help, speaking up before things reached a crescendo,” she says. “I created ‘Rachel’s Rules’, a list that I stuck up at home: good is better than perfect; recognise when it’s time to take a break; it’s OK to say no.”There is, she believes, real value in labelling the problem. “When I first had it, my parents were like, ‘Parenting’s hard,’” she says, adding that, in older generations, there is resistance to pathologising mental and emotional health. Stern reasons that, if health agencies acknowledge workplace burnout, they should also acknowledge this familial version. “If that is a globally accepted condition, with support structures in place, then why not recognise that burnout can happen in other areas of people’s lives? Having a label attached helps with that recognition.”She adds, “If the rhetoric is, ‘Yeah, parenting’s hard’, then people who are really suffering feel they have to get on with it and can’t speak up or get help. There is this tipping point with burnout that carries a real mental health risk to parent and child, and their relationship. Calling it what it is will help this generation and future generations of parents get the support they need.”Once back at work, and while still raising her sons, Stern trained with Roskam and Mikolajczak’s institute to help others through their experiences of the phenomenon, setting up as aparental burnout coach. “I felt compelled to contribute to the field, raise awareness and, one day, do my own research to better understand this and make sure people don’t reach the point I did,” she says.Today, she parents differently. “I’ve lowered my standards. I remind myself most days that all I need to do is get through, make sure everyone is fed and remember that OK is enough.” It has allowed her to enjoy more moments such as watching her youngest learn to read or going swimming with her eldest. “I still find it hard,” she says. “Characteristics of parental burnout come out. They’re nowhere near as extreme but I’m always going to be on the precipice.”Explore more on these topicsParents and parentingFamilyHealth & wellbeingChildrenMental healthHealthfeaturesShareReuse this content"

She replied, ‘Because I loved my people’ | Stuart RintoulRead moreO’Donoghue would go on to play a critical role in some of the most historic moments in Indigenous affairs, including the 1967 referendum, the passing of the Native Title Act in 1993 and the 2008 national apology to the stolen generations.She found her birth mother after a chance encounter with relatives in Coober Pedy in 1967, but after more than 30 years apart it was anuneasy reunion.The documentary evidence of her extraordinary life has, until recently, been bundled in boxes at the National Library of Australia – and in Edwards’s lounge room.When Edwards and her daughter pried them open, they found copies of every nursing exam O’Donoghue had taken; a framed copy ofPaul Keating’s Redfern speechsigned by the then prime minister; and a report she’d written, outlining a model for the first national elected representative body for Indigenous people, which she would later chair.View image in fullscreenDr Lowitja O’Donoghue AC CBE DSG, with great niece Ruby Edwards, left, and niece Deb Edwards.Photograph: Leanne KingThere were personal mementoes too: black and white photos of O’Donoghue, young and in love, with her husband-to-be in the Flinders Ranges; a letter from her sister as she approached retirement, which read: “We loaned you to the commonwealth … it’s time to come home now.”Edwards says they speak to her aunt’s ability to have “a foot in each world”.She recalls when her own daughter, Ruby, was born. “It meant the world to her, and she totally immersed herself in me being a new young mother … yet the next day she could go, ‘Well, I’m jumping on a plane because I’m going to meet Nelson Mandela’,” she says.The mammoth task of curating the exhibition is ongoing, but Edwards – also the head of the Lowitja O’Donoghue Foundation – hopes it will show a softer side of the woman famed for her staunch advocacy.Earlier this month, on the first anniversary of her aunt’s death, Edwards and her daughter went to the site of the old Colebrook home in the Adelaide foothills. There is a sculpture of an Aboriginal woman, eyes downcast and empty arms outstretched, calledThe Grieving Mother.They laid flowers in her arms.When O’Donoghue’s biographer asked what motivated her life’s work, she replied: “Because I loved my people.”For Edwards, the answer is just as simple. “It’s what she’d want me to do.”Lowitja – A Life of Leadership and Legacy will be held at the Kerry Packer civic gallery, managed by the Bob Hawke prime ministerial centre, University of South Australia in Adelaide from 4 June to 25 July 2025.Explore more on these topicsIndigenous AustraliansIndigenous affairs reportingAustralian politicsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

His wife works at a daycare and the couple is raising two sons. He and his family have built a new life on the shores of Lake Erie, having fled Ukraine after a Russian bomb blew out two windows of their Kyiv apartment in December 2022.“There was no electricity, no water, so we decided to come to the US,” he says.‘We no longer go out alone’: what happens after Trump revokes temporary protected status?Read moreBut theTrump administration’s threats to end programs that have allowed Ukrainians to live and work legally in the US has cast a pall over all his efforts.“I applied for TPS [Temporary Protected Status] five days ago, but who knows [what will happen]. Our applications are still pending,” he says.Three years since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians have forged a new life in the US. One of the largest communities – about 15,000 people – has come toCleveland, a city that’s been hemorrhaging residents for decades.Shortly after taking office, Trumppaused application decisionsfor the Uniting for Ukraine (U4U) parole sponsorship program that allowed about 150,000 Ukrainians fleeing the Russian invasion to enter and work legally in the US for up to two years. Many fear the program could be permanently shut down.Last month, the Biden administration extended TPS for more than 100,000 Ukrainians already in the US for 18 months until October next year. Trump has since ordered a review of the widerTPS program, which could affect the residency statuses of about a million people from 17 countries who have fled violence, unrest and environmental disasters.We don’t know what will happen here tomorrowTetianaJD Vance, the US vice-president, has for several yearsrepeatedly called for ending supportfor Ukraine, and many fear he may push Kyiv to agree to a settlement with Russia that would see Moscow keep some or all of the Ukrainian territory it currently occupies. Last weekcomments bythe Pentagon chief,Pete Hegseth– and Trump himself – appeared to embrace that stance and undermine Ukraine’s bargaining position in any peace talks to potentially end the war.The ties that bind Cleveland andUkrainego back more than a century. The first Ukrainian immigrants settled in the Tremont area of the city in the 1880s, working in the region’s booming manufacturing industries. Thousands more were drawn to Cleveland after the first world war.Today, Parma, a city south of downtown Cleveland, is home to the Ukrainian Village neighborhood where half a dozen Ukrainian churches and cathedrals, several built in the stunning Byzantine architectural style, are found. Its main thoroughfares are lined with Ukrainian flags and Ukrainian is the language heard in many local stores and cafes.With one in 10 of all Ukrainians in the US through TPS living in north-eastOhio, Cleveland has served as a key center for Ukrainians, some of whom have been employed as medical experts at Cleveland Clinic.“Over the past three years I’ve seen cleaning companies, flower shops, design shops open up. I’ve had coffee atbrand new Ukrainian coffee shops. I’ve seen new Ukrainian stores open in Parma,” says Zachary Nelson, the program director atGlobal Cleveland, a non-profit that works with immigrants, including dozens of Ukrainian families through the Uniting for Ukraine program.The heartlessness of the deal: how Trump’s ‘America first’ stance sold out UkraineRead more“There are Amazon resell places where 80% of the staff are U4U recipients. They are our rust remover in the Rust belt. They are our buffing agent.”Midwestern states such as Ohio have struggled to maintain or grow their populations for decades, withrecent research suggestingthat declining numbers have only been held off due to the presence of immigrants.Nelson says several Ukrainians have shared their fear that their immigration status may be canceled. “They’re asking: ‘Will we have to leave within two months? Are they going to arrest us and send us to Guantánamo Bay?’” he says.“When they are getting all their information from Facebook or Twitter, the stress is real.”Although other global events have overtaken much of the coverage of the war in Ukraine, the conflict there continues unabated.“I speak to my parents and sister inKyiv,” says Tetiana, a mother of one living in Cleveland who asked not to be fully identified as her husband serves in Ukraine’s special forces. “There are still attacks every day.”They are our rust remover in the Rust beltZachary Nelson, Global ClevelandThis winter, as in previous years, Ukrainians have suffered from rolling blackouts due to Russia’s bombing of power plants and other key infrastructure. The US State Department currently has alevel 4 “do not travel” warningfor Ukraine, and Moscow is expected to up its attacks across the country in the coming weeks as the third anniversary of its full-scale invasion approaches.Now in Cleveland for almost two and a half years, Tetiana says her six-year-old son has settled well in school and has even become a fan of the Cleveland Browns, who he watches on TV every Sunday during the NFL season.“We go to church in Parma,” she says. “There is a really great community here.”But recent weeks have created panic among her – she came to the US through U4U and has also applied for TPS – and her relatives.Relief for immigrants as legal services restored after Trump-induced chaosRead more“Now I’m very worried about what will happen because the war is continuing – the war hasn’t stopped and we don’t know what will happen here tomorrow,” she says.“Maybe the government will close this program – I heard they can stop it immediately – and tell us to go home, but it’s still dangerous in Ukraine. I only have TPS until April; it’s very soon. I don’t know what I’m supposed to do.”She says her son wants to stay in the US because it’s safe. “He hears every day that there is still a war in Ukraine,” she says.“I’m worried about my son’s life.”Send us a tipIf you have information you’d like to share securely with the Guardian about the impact of the Trump administration’s temporary protected status decision, please use a non-work device to contact us via the Signal messaging app at(929) 418-7175.Explore more on these topicsClevelandUkraineTrump administrationOhioKyivDonald TrumpfeaturesShareReuse this content"

What if he ignores their orders?Experts warn ‘this isn’t normal’, as administration defies rulings and Vance expresses contempt for legal constraintsChris McGrealSat 15 Feb 2025 07.00 ESTShareYears before he became the US vice-president and openly advocated defiance of the courts over the Trump administration’s blitz through the federal bureaucracy and constitution,JD Vancerevealed his contempt for legal constraints.In 2021, Vance predicted thatDonald Trumpwould again be elected president and advised him to “fire every single midlevel bureaucrat, every civil servant in the administrative state, replace them with our people”.“Then when the courts stop you, stand before the country like Andrew Jackson did and say: ‘The chief justice has made his ruling. Now let him enforce it,’” he told theJack Murphy Livepodcast.Whether the seventh American president actually said that remains disputed, but the sentiment is alive and well as the Trump administration defiesfederal court ordersto at least pause its subversion of the constitution and destructive rampage through the federal bureaucracy led by Elon Musk.Trump’s illegitimate power grab brings US closer to dictatorshipRead moreIn the absence of action by Congress to defend its powers, it has been government workers, state attorneys general and unions who have counterattacked, with aflurry of lawsuits– challenging presidential orders to limit the constitutional right of anyone born in the US to be a citizen, a federal funding freeze, and the dismissal of corruption watchdogs, among other measures. Nearly50 legal challengeshave been filed in the last three weeks, an unprecedented pushback in the courts against a new administration.The lawsuits have resulted in a string of court rulings. They have put a hold on some of Trump’s executive orders freezing some spending. They have also restricted Musk, head of the so-called “department of government efficiency”, from sending his staff to rifle through the financial records of federal agencies such as the US Agency for International Development (USAid) and the education department as a means to restrict their work or even close them down.But it quickly became apparent that the administration was defying some of the court orders, while its supporters attacked what they called “rogue judges” for ruling against Trump – and Vance portrayed the courts as just another bureaucratic obstacle to the president implementing the people’s will.What we’ve seen in the first three weeks is unprecedented in American historyErwin ChemerinskyThat has prompted warnings from legal scholars, including Erwin Chemerinsky, dean of the University of California Berkeley law school, of a constitutional crisis in the making.“It’s very frightening to think that they will disobey court orders. If they don’t, it will be a constitutional crisis unlike anything this country has seen, because if the president can violate constitutional laws and disobey court orders then the name for that is a dictatorship,” he said.“This isn’t the realm of normal. What we’ve seen in the first three weeks is unprecedented in American history.”The judge John McConnell has accused theTrump administrationof deliberately disobeying an order obliging the government to reinstate billions of dollars in grants. Another judge, Loren AliKhan, accused the administration of defying its legal obligations after she ordered the office for budget and management (OMB) to halt a spending freeze.Vance pushed back against the rulings on X.“If a judge tried to tell a general how to conduct a military operation, that would be illegal,” hewrote.“Judges aren’t allowed to control the executive’s legitimate power.”Muskcalledfor one of the judges involved to be impeached.Trump won a victory on Thursday when a judge ruled in favour of Musk’s offer to almost all of the 2 million-strong federal workforce of eight months of pay for not working if they resign now. The email’s subject line, “Fork in the Road”, was the same as one he used in a message to employees when he bought Twitter in 2022 and got rid of about 80% of its staff. Shortly after the deadline set by the email for voluntary redundancy, which was accepted by about 65,000 federal workers, unions said involuntary dismissals had begun.Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, praised the rare court victory.“This goes to show that lawfare will not ultimately prevail over the will of 77 million Americans who supported President Trump and his priorities,” she said.But mostly the courts have so far ruled against the Trump administration as it pursues a power grab.The American Bar Association, which represents hundreds of thousands of lawyers in the US, has condemned what it called the Trump administration’s “wide-scale aﬀronts to the rule of law itself”.“We have seen attempts at wholesale dismantling of departments and entities created by Congress without seeking the required congressional approval to change the law,” it said.The ABA also condemned “eﬀorts to dismiss employees with little regard for the law and protections they merit” and social media posts intended “to inflame”.“This is chaotic. It may appeal to a few. But it is wrong. And most Americans recognize it is wrong. It is also contrary to the rule of law,” it said.It’s likely that at least some of the flood of lawsuits will end up before the supreme court. The administration may in fact want to see some cases reach the highest court, which has a solid conservative majority after Trump appointed three of its nine justices during his first term, as it seeks to consolidate even more power in the presidency over issues such as who has final control over spending allocated by Congress.But the process of moving through district and appeals courts before making it to the supreme court is unlikely to be swift, by which time Musk may already have achieved much of what he aims to do in wrecking the work of USAid, the education department and other federal agencies.Then there is the unpredictability of a supreme court that has already overturned precedent in striking down the right to abortion.Chemerinsky believes the Trump administration is all but certain to lose cases on birthright citizenship, the freeze on spending and the dismissals of commissioners that oversee labour rights, consumer protection and equal employment opportunities, because they are in breach of federal law. He said the court was also likely to order the administration to back down from attempts to eliminate individual agencies created by Congress.But what if the administration follows Vance’s call to openly defy the courts? Chemerinsky said that would set up “a constitutional confrontation unlike any we’ve seen”.“The courts have limited ability to enforce their orders. They could hold individuals other than the president in contempt of court. They could figure out who’s responsible for carrying out the court order and hold that person in contempt with fines or jail for civil contempt. But the idea of the courts holding a cabinet secretary, an attorney general, a secretary of defence in contempt is just unheard of in the United States,” he said.“It’s so hard to imagine where we’ll be in four years. When you think about what’s going on in just three weeks, it’s certainDonald Trumpis claiming expansive executive power beyond what any president has ever asserted. How much will the courts allow that? There’s no way to know.”Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationUS politicsLaw (US)JD VanceDonald Trump JrUSAidElon MuskfeaturesShareReuse this content"

She had looked me up and down, considering my skirt suit and heels. “You have to dress modestly,” she said, “to meet theIslamic Statewomen.”It was 2019, and so far my career had revolved around mostly failed efforts to help stabiliseIraq, including attempts to influence US Iraq policy from Washington thinktanks and convening high-profile Iraqi leaders in various absurd peace processes. I had grown up half-Iraqi in the UK during the invasion of Iraq – and I felt duty-bound to help my motherland.Eventually, I became a peacebuilding consultant (yes, that’s a real job) and spent most of my time in Baghdad meeting politicians. I would urge them to embrace political inclusion as a means of preventing a resurgence of violent extremism. They would call me a terrorist sympathiser. And we’d do that dance over and over again. But I was growing tired of the lack of progress. So, when the Iraqi government suggested I focus on a new problem – the fate of IS families – I jumped at the chance.After the military defeat of IS, the fighters had been killed or imprisoned, but their families were stuck in refugee camps. The government was concerned they posed a threat and their communities didn’t want them to come home. Security services floated the idea of a “deradicalisation programme”. Could we interrogate the beliefs of IS women and make sure they were safe to release?So, the Iraqi MP and I dressed in our most modest clothes and visited a refugee camp to investigate. Camp authorities arranged for us to meet some suspected IS women. We stood for a moment outside the tent, feeling suddenly afraid. What if these women were dangerous?We walked in, the light straining through the dark plastic ceiling. Four women sat on thin foam mattresses on the floor. They wore colourful headscarves and long dresses, their blackened feet bare, plastic slippers stacked by the back entrance. Scores of children ran in and out, yelling as they played tag.“IS came to our village and took girls to marry,” said one of the women. “What could we do? We cannot say no.” She gestured towards a teenage girl, who stared at the ground, picking at her cuticles. “This one is 17, they forced her, now she has two children.”I’d spent my entire career trying to be taken seriously as one of few women working on Middle East policy. Now I was writing a novel full of sex jokesAs I looked at her, I felt silly for having been afraid. These women, like most in the Iraqi camps, were unequivocal victims. “We’re not like the foreigners,” the woman continued, “who came from outside to join IS. We had no choice.” My mind turned to the British teenage girls whohadtravelled to the Islamic State. They were now sitting in camps just across the border in Syria. Could they be considered victims? The thought triggered a deep uneasiness.As we travelled back to Baghdad, I wondered why I felt such a strong sense of discomfort. I didn’t just feel pity towards the IS women, I felt personally connected to them. That’s when it dawned on me. I’d come close to radicalism myself, and given the right circumstances, I could have ended up an IS bride.I’ve always been a bleeding-heart empath: that’s why I went into peacebuilding. But as a teenager, that same impulse could have seen me join a terrorist group. I grew up watching my mum sob over mass killings in Bosnia, did my GCSEs as the UK bombed Afghanistan, prepared for my A-levels when we invaded Iraq. Dead Muslim bodies on TV were ubiquitous, and it felt targeted and intentional. One summer, when I was 17, I studied with sheikh Anwar al-Awlaki, a charismatic Yemeni-American preacher who spoke compellingly about Muslims being under siege. I was entranced by him. A few years later, Awlaki joined al-Qaida. He never tried to recruit me, but what if he had? What if he told me I could defend innocent lives, that the terrible things I’d heard about al-Qaida were just western propaganda? I might have believed him.Instead, I went to university and my capacity for critical thinking grew and matured. I still believed in fighting injustice, I just knew al-Qaida wasn’t the right vehicle to do it. But there was another generation of teenage girls who weren’t as lucky as me. The ones who came of age watching massacres of Syrian civilians on YouTube, who were persuaded that by joining IS they could save lives.In the weeks after my camp visit, as I read the academic literature on deradicalisation, I kept imagining my teenage self as an IS bride. What would she say to me now? “You want to brainwash your people to make western war criminals feel safer in their beds?”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

She saw the absurdity of my work in the international aid industry, the daily compromises to my integrity, the types of people I had to suck up to – and she told me the unvarnished truth. She reminded me of how far I’d strayed from my ideals. But in her words I also heard inexperience, youth and naivety, and my heart broke for her. She’d taken the wrong fork in the road, all her well-meaning passion squandered on that catastrophic choice.As we conversed, a 35-year-old peacebuilding practitioner and an imaginary 15-year-old, we covered rich ground. The dislocation we’d felt as second-generation British Muslims, the struggles we’d had connecting to our parents, the friendships we’d used to fill the resulting void. We argued about religion, politics, international institutions, sexuality, women’s liberation and the roles we wanted to inhabit.But what surprised me most about those conversations was how much they made me laugh. There’s something hilarious about a person who says things you’d never dare say, who sees you for exactly who you are. She was witty, precocious and unafraid – unbound by the strictures and expectations of educated, middle-class Britain.That’s when I knew I had a novel. It felt precious, this spark of joy I’d found in what could’ve been the bleakest of subjects, and I resolved to cultivate it. So, I took a standup comedy course. I wrote down everything from my religious youth, my peacebuilding career, my time in Baghdad, and tested it out on my class. Whenever they laughed, I’d take note.If I was going to write about IS brides, it had to be laugh-out-loud funny, it had to earn its place on a reader’s nightstand. That’s how I would reach the widest audience. The fate of British IS brides is a national debate, but few people have access to the reality of that experience, and there’s so little understanding of its emotional truth. Through an entertaining, plot-driven, page-turner of a novel, I could make it possible for all types of readers to engage.It was a huge risk. I’d spent my entire career trying to be taken seriously as one of few women working on Middle East policy. I’d done a PhD, gone to Oxford and Harvard, published extremely sober papers and articles, spoken at endless dreary conferences. Now I was writing a novel full of sex jokes. But when the plans for a deradicalisation programme in Iraq collapsed, and the foreign IS brides remained stuck in camps in Syria, and the policy debates grew vitriolic and reductive – I knew I had to take the leap. Nothing else I’d done had made any tangible difference. And who knows, maybe a naughty, funny novel full of relatable characters will be the thing that finally moves the conversation on.Fundamentallyby Nussaibah Younis is published by W&N on 25 February.

In other words, pushing to make a once shambolic party into a credible electoral force.Zia the gatekeeperReform has moved into Millbank Tower, on the banks of the Thames and minutes from Westminster. Fittingly for a party aspiring to govern, this block was once home to David Cameron’s Tories, and it was where Tony Blair’s Labour plotted its 1997 victory. Yusuf, Reform’s 38-year-old chair, is said to be there “all the time” and Farage also has a desk.Insiders say that after the 2024 election, Farage delegated almost all operational control of the party to Yusuf, who had emerged as a donor months before. They quickly shut Reform’s HQ in the Leicestershire town of Ashby-de-la-Zouch and left a serviced office in London’s Victoria that was considered to be “little more than a meeting room”.View image in fullscreenZia Yusuf has said his and Farage’s ‘views of the world … aligned very, very well’.Photograph: Hollie Adams/ReutersYusuf, who has known Farage for more than a decade, is said by staffers to have got in touch last spring out of the blue and offered to donate a six-figure sum. Insiders say he appeared ready for the next thing after selling his concierge company, Velocity Black, and making a reported £32m.Staffers say the former Goldman Sachs executive caused surprise within HQ when he suggested introducing key performance indicators (KPIs) to spur on Reform’s army of canvassers. “It took some of the old guard who’ve been around to point out we were basically talking about older volunteers in the country who were doing this for free,” a source said. But Yusuf appears to have been persuasive about the targets: Reform officials are now subject to KPIs.Yusuf has helped the party grow from zero official constituency branches to more than 400 across Britain, and he told the Guardian that Reform was building its own tech that he believed would be “decisive” in the next election.Recalling the first time he met Farage, Yusuf said: “It was very clear that mine and Nigel’s views of the world and our philosophies aligned very, very well.”Last year Yusuf replaced the Ukip veteran Paul Oakden as Reform chair and set about removing old hands, including Gawain Towler, the party’s communications chief who had been removed and reinstated at least twice before.Yusuf is now gatekeeper to Farage and at his side for crucial conversations, such as those with defecting politicians. Ann Widdecombe, the former Conservative minister and Reform candidate, said: “I tend to feed my thoughts in via Zia, who is very sharp. Nigel is leading the party and has his constituency [too].”The tribeAside from Yusuf, Reform’s engine room features a crew of young male advisers who are instrumental in building Farage’s social media image. He now has more than 1 million TikTok followers and 2.2 million on X – more than Keir Starmer’s 1.8 million and far outstripping Kemi Badenoch’s 300,000.These staffers are responsible for Farage’s packed rallies from Essex to the north-east of England, which are unlike anything Labour or the Conservatives are doing.The events typically kick off with high-energy warm-up speeches before Farage, flanked by bodyguards, makes a passage through fans to the sound of Eminem’s Without Me. With the lyrics “Guess who’s back?”, the song was deployed in last year’s election. Insiders say the party “picked it up and ran with it” after supporters used it in online memes.View image in fullscreenNigel Farage listening from the wing preparing for an appearance at a Reform rally at Sandown Park racecourse last month.Photograph: Sean Smith/The GuardianThe team includes a slew of 20-somethings with rightwing media backgrounds, from Aaron Lobo, a former producer at GB News, to Jack Anderton, 24, whose own videos seek to present being anti-immigration as a gen Z priority (“the kids want deportations”).A nephew of the former Fox News host Tucker Carlson has recently been recruited to the communications team: Charles Carlson fields calls from reporters and is a frontline presence at press conferences.Others now working with the party include Archie Manners, a ​YouTube creator and prankster whose stunts included arranging a “dick of the year” award for Suella Braverman, the Tory MP most tipped to defect to Reform. Despite many of its senior figures being men, Reform says it also has lots of female employees in its HQ and regional campaign teams.Once a month many staffers, along with Reform supporters and even some politically adjacent Tories who forged friendships in the Brexit years – known by some as “the tribe” – gather in a Millbank pub to exchange ideas.‘Professionalisation’While Farage and Yusuf talk of professionalisation, there is also a sense within Reform that loyalty and common ideology are more important than spotless backgrounds. Yusuf has hired as his chief of staff another former Tory, Matthew MacKinnon, who in 2012 wasbanned from football groundsunder a civil order after pleading guilty to disorder. The ban was lifted two years later, after he made an application to end it.The party has also stood behind its MPs James McMurdock, after it emerged he wasjailed as a teenagerfor kicking his girlfriend, and Lee Anderson, who wassuspended from the Conservative partyafter suggesting the London mayor, Sadiq Khan, was controlled by Islamists.Mugshot of George Cottrell in 2016.Photograph: Federal Bureau of PrisonsThen there is Cottrell, known as “Posh George”, a 31-year-old financier and high-stakes gambler whoreportedly lost £16min a Montenegro casino last year and who served eight months in a US jail for wire fraud, ending in 2017.No one is clear what Cottrell’s role is within Reform. One friend says he is “personally important to Nigel but not politically important”, describing him as “mercurial” but also “hugely generous”. He was at a swanky fundraiser in Mayfair last month, at Farage’s side when he was“milkshaked” in Clacton, on helicopter trips during the election campaign and on the sidelines of last week’sReform press conferenceon the local elections.Cottrell’s mother, Fiona, hasdonated £500,000 to Reformand Cottrell funded Farage’s £9,000 trip to a Brussels conference. Tatler reported earlier this year that Cottrell sometimes referred to Farage as “Daddy” and that the Reform leader was “often there, making coffee” at Cottrell’s west London house.SplitsIn contrast to Farage’s embrace of colourful characters within his circle, the party has taken a hard approach to activists deemed to have brought it into disrepute – and a red line appears to be support for the far-right activistTommy Robinson, who founded the English Defence League “against the rise of radical Islam”.This has upset many Reform members, often veterans of its Brexit party and Ukip heritage, who claim to have been purged and are organising what could eventually become a rival party.Trouble is also brewing after Yusuf’s reorganisation included a message that branches could no longer engage withBen Habib, the party’s former deputy leader who quit after pushing for members to have more power.“You certainly can’t work with Ben Habib at all, that decision came directly from Zia,” one member was told by Graham Young, Reform’s national campaign manager, in messages seen by the Guardian. Richard Tice, the deputy leader, told another branch official who queried why Habib couldn’t be a speaker: “Please do what HQ says.” Reform says there was no specific edict against Habib but that non-members are not allowed to come to branch meetings which it says is “normal for all political parties”.View image in fullscreenBen Habib quit as deputy leader after pushing for members to have more power.Photograph: Gary Calton/The ObserverSome of those suspended over support for Robinson believe the real reason is their complaints about a lack of democracy in Reform, which remains a company majority-controlled by Farage. A new constitution voted on by members at last year’s conference was only recently submitted to the Electoral Commission.The splits could yet cost votes for Reform in target areas. Last week, suspended Reform members from Wales, Sussex and elsewhere gathered in Derbyshire, where 10 councillors broke away from the party weeks earlier. If a rival party is formed, there is speculation it will be led by Habib. The former Brexit party MEP has joined forces with the Conservative peer Daniel Hannan to found GB PAC, which could back independent rivals to take on Reform.The rebels suspended in Wales include Vicki Roskams, a one-time Reform star who came second in a north Wales seat and is taking the party to tribunal alleging constructive dismissal.She described a dictatorial approach under Yusuf and suggested Badenoch was right to question whether Reform had 140,000 members. Those members, she claims, included a dog called Maverick in Wales signed up as a “young member”. Reform says it has invited media organisations to inspect IT systems recording the size of its membership, which now exceeds 200,000.Roskams said: “So many people at grassroots level feel really taken for granted or are being pushed out.” She said she was also acting for people surprised when Reform continued to debit £25 from their accounts after they were suspended. “If they can’t run a party and treat people correctly then how can they run a country?”The Musk momentGrassroots tensions over how to treat the extreme right are mirrored among Reform’s five MPs, with Farage caught in the middle. At one end, Rupert Lowe, the MP for Great Yarmouth, has said Robinson “deserves credit” for his controversial focus on grooming by gangs of Pakistani-heritage men and described his supporters as “solid British citizens”. At the other, Tice insisted “we want nothing to do with Tommy Robinson” and “all of that lot”.In the end, Farage came down on the side of Tice, saying Robinson was not welcome in the party – a statement that may have cost a donation of $100m from Elon Musk.View image in fullscreenNick Candy, Elon Musk and Farage at Mar-a-Lago in December.Photograph: Stuart Mitchell/PAAfter years of wooing Trump, Farage was riding high after being given a shout-out by the presidential candidate at his eve-of-election rally in November. He later went with Candy, Reform’s chief fundraiser, to meet Musk. But things started to go wrong: the unpredictable billionaire was unhappy with Reform’s anti-Robinson stance, and subsequently posted on X that Farage was not the right man for the job, questioning whether Lowe could replace him.One Reform official says this was the worst moment he had known for Farage, causing pure panic for 45 minutes before they worked out how to deal with it. In the end, Farage was firm. Reform would have nothing to do with Robinson, even if that meant losing money from Musk, he said, while being careful to not pick a fight with him.Later, the Reform leader did not make the cut for Trump’s inauguration ceremony, unlike Boris Johnson. Instead, Farage attended a pollster’s party alongside the former Trump adviser Steve Bannon, the former Brexit campaign donor Arron Banks, and Christopher Harborne, the crypto and aviation fuel entrepreneur who gave Farage’s Brexit party about £10m in 2019.Farage shrugged off the episode. But Musk’s support for Lowe helped fuel the idea among some Reform activists that they would prefer a leader more favourable to Robinson.Farage may have sided with Tice but Reform watchers say the two men are not as close as they once were. Tice kept the party afloat with £1.4m of loans and a skeleton staff after Brexit. But in the end he was told only at the last minute that Farage had decided to take over as leader and stand as an MP, two weeks into the election campaign, after meeting people in Skegness and Ashfield who told him he was “letting the base down”.View image in fullscreenRichard Tice in London this week at a farmers’ protest against changes to inheritance tax rules.Photograph: Henry Nicholls/AFP/Getty ImagesTice is still friendly with Farage, and his allies insist he has not been sidelined. The former leader and MP for Boston and Skegness in Lincolnshire is now focused on Westminster politics and some policy, such as opposing the push for net zero. “But he is not in favour as much as Zia,” said one insider.Two sources said there were some at the heart of Reform who did not trust Tice’s partner, Isabel Oakeshott, the former Sunday Times political editor who turned over Matt Hancock’s lockdown WhatsApp messages to the Daily Telegraph after helping the former health secretary write a book. Oakeshott described these suggestions as “nonsense” and said she was “full square behind everything the party leadership is doing”.DefectionsOne-time Tory donors thinking of switching to Reform are delighted by Yusuf’s moves to tighten its operation. A rejection of Robinson also creates a dividing line with the far right and makes alignment with the Tories more possible, if not under Badenoch then under an alternative leader such as Robert Jenrick.Reform has poached at least two former Conservative staffers – Luigi Murton and Michael Hadwen, who both worked on Jenrick’s leadership campaign – and there have been rumours swirling about plots to bring the Tories and Reform together in a Farage-Jenrick or Farage-Johnson merger, denied vigorously by all sides.View image in fullscreenAndrea Jenkyns is running as the Reform candidate for Lincolnshire mayor.Photograph: Leon Neal/Getty ImagesAndrea Jenkyns, the former Tory MP who is running as the Reform candidate for Lincolnshire mayor, said she would like a pact with the Conservatives and claimed Reform has better resources than her old party, including candidate WhatsApp groups with direct access to HQ officials.“When I first defected, a few former colleagues contacted me but didn’t want to do it at the same time. It’s a big move – your friendship group as well. But I know more want to come over, including a former secretary of state,” she said.The mooted defections may include Braverman, the former home secretary whose husband, Rael, isin Farage’s circleand attended the party’s fundraiser last month. Associates of Braverman think she will jump but is biding her time to attract maximum attention, such as a bad set of local election results. In the meantime, some in Reform are uncomfortable about having the husband of a Conservative MP so close to the top and wish she would make up her mind.While Reform has been hampered by thepostponement of some local electionsin May, Farage is still bullish, suggesting it could eventually be in a position to take a governing role on Essex county council. In the mayoral elections, the party is advertising for candidates, with “no prior experience … necessary”.Ant Middleton, the former soldier who left Channel 4’s SAS: Who Dares Wins show after controversial comments about the pandemic and Black Lives Matter, is tipped as a potential Reform London mayoral candidate. But making headway in the polls requires well-funded campaigns, something Farage did not have under his previous party, Ukip.Candy the money man“This is the house that Nick built,” says one Reform insider of the money rolling into the party. Candy, a property developer who owns Britain’s most expensive home (a£150m penthouseat One Hyde Park), is the other linchpin of Reform’s new-look operation and has been persuading Tory donors the party is worth a punt.He is understood to be eager to fundraise “more in the American way” and is not bashful about asking for cash outright. Along the way, Farage and Candy want to make it “fun” – plans were drawn up for a “Reform Glastonbury” festival at Blenheim Palace, though it appears to have beendropped because of charity laws.Candy was drawn into the party by his wife, the former Neighbours actor and pop starHolly Valance, who came close to contesting a seat for Reform. Tory donors including Bassim Haidar and Mohamed Amersi, whopaid £25,000 a headto attend Reform’s Mayfair fundraiser, where guests supped on Dom Pérignon and Farage aped Trump by singing along to YMCA, have come through his contact book.View image in fullscreenHolly Valance and Charlie Mullins, the owner of Pimlico Plumbers, at a Reform event last June.Photograph: Guy Bell/Rex/ShutterstockPeter Hall, a London-based Australian financier who gave £500,000 to the Tories, told the Guardian he wanted to stand as a Reform MP and had given Farage a copy ofSix Degrees, a seminal book warning of the impact of the climate crisis, which they have debated.“It [Reform] was born of the fringes and it is gradually moving towards the centre,” said Hall, who is sometimes credited with bringing the flat white coffee to Britain and has given Reform £60,000.Amersi, a controversial figure who gave almost £500,000 to the Conservatives, is considering a switch to Reform too and said he and others may fund a thinktank for the party to prepare for government.“The Tories have had thinktanks like Policy Exchange and Onwards. This would have financial support and it’s always best to have at least 10 funders. Anything less than that, then it looks like it’s captive – but if it’s diverse and spread out then nobody can control [it],” he said.Stumbling blocksOne old friend of Farage says they do not believe the Reform leader will stumble now before the next election as he is “pretty much the most experienced politician in Westminster”. But they said of his faults: “It’s the same story: details and patience.”They also do not believe Farage will be prepared to shift towards the centre or follow the whims of focus groups to win. “He’s actually not a populist,” the friend said, arguing that the Reform leader sought to persuade people to come round to his position, as on Brexit, which for many years was seen as eccentric.At the same time, some observers think Farage is still too attached to fringe-right hangers-on who could cause future problems over controversial comments or conspiracy theories. Among those at his Mayfair fundraiser was Amanda Eliasch, one of the founding supporters of Turning Point UK, a spin-off from a pro-Trump US youth campaign, whose personal blog contains conspiracy theories about 5G, George Soros and vaccines.View image in fullscreenThe City financier Jeremy Hosking, pictured in 2016, is among Reform’s donors.Photograph: Jack Taylor/Getty ImagesThe party is also accepting donations from Jeremy Hosking, the former Tory donor turned funder of the Reclaim party, led by a hard-right figure, Laurence Fox, and supportive of Andrew Bridgen, wholost the Conservative whipover Covid vaccine claims that were criticised as “dangerous”. Hosking said he gave £100,000 to Reform before the last election seeking to encourage it to “engage more in cultural issues”.View image in fullscreenFarage and Conor McGregor at a rally for Donald Trump in January.Photograph: Brian Snyder/ReutersFarage himself walks a thin line when it comes to his associations with macho online podcasters and rightwing pundits, using them to build support among young men. In America he wasphotographed with Conor McGregor, the MMA fighter who lost a civil rape case in Ireland, while Farage has more than once said he can see why young people are drawn to Andrew Tate, the self-styled misogynist influencer.Then there are his jobs. Since becoming an MP, Farage has made £600,000 from social media activities, his GB News job and a gigflogging goldfor a firm called Direct Bullion. In one month, he spent 28 hours recording personalised Cameo video messages for £76 each, making £27,000.While there is no suggestion he has broken any rules, the amount of time Farage spends on non-political work may ultimately play badly with the electorate, both in his Essex seat and at the next election.When asked about the professionalisation drive, tensions within Reform and criticisms of the party, a party spokesperson said “hit pieces” on Reform were “unsurprising given that under new management it has surged to be the most popular party in the country”.They said: “Bad-faith actors attempting to infiltrate Reform will not succeed. Our grassroots strength is illustrated by the remarkable membership growth, Reform has added 100,000 members in 75 days and will shortly become the largest party in the UK.”View image in fullscreenA Reform supporter tapes a campaign poster to his car in Clacton, July 2024.Photograph: Henry Nicholls/AFP/Getty ImagesAll eyes on 2029“All deliveries via the Big Fat Greek Taverna, please,” says a Reform-branded sign on the door of Farage’s new office in his Clacton constituency, in the side room of a Mediterranean restaurant on the seafront.During the election, Farage operated from an office block above an amusement arcade, but he vacated the £1,500-a-month space last summer, leaving alandlord angryabout late bills, walls painted Reform-turquoise and scattered political detritus.Farage claims the Essex town appreciates being “put on the map” by his presence, despite frequent trips to the US and various side gigs. Countering criticism that he is rarely there, he has justbought a housein Frinton-on-Sea, an upmarket seaside town within the constituency.Giles Watling, a former Tory MP, is charitable, saying it is difficult to balance being an MP with being a big public figure. But he says that despite smartening up its act, Reform still does not have enough depth beyond Farage.“Anyone can just rush in front of an audience in a presidential style and say: ‘Do you believe in Britain? Do you believe in the NHS?’ Everyone says yes. But at the moment Reform doesn’t have the basis, background or detailed policies.”More policy may be the next step from Reform, which had no manifesto last year, having released instead a “contract” with the electorate. It began by announcing plans last week to impose taxes on the renewable energy sector.View image in fullscreenThe election count in Clacton where Farage won the seat last summer.Photograph: Graeme Robertson/The GuardianPolitical analysts are on the fence about whether Reform can break through a ceiling among voters while its MPs continue to hold stances including support for the death penalty and hostility to net zero. Farage’s pastattacks on the NHS modeland claims Russia was “provoked” on Ukraine hang over him.Polling from YouGovthis week put Reform on 26%, Labour on 25% and the Conservatives on 21%, but showed Starmer holding a firm lead over Farage on who would make the best prime minister; the Reform leader was neck and neck with Badenoch.Despite the doubts, Rob Ford, a politics professor at Manchester University and co-author of one of the first books to examine the appeal of Farage’s politics, says “there has never been a better window of opportunity for them”.“What they represent now is a distinctly more credible challenge to the two-party duopoly than the Farage-led parties before,” Ford said. “Britain’s first-past-the-post system mitigates against new parties, but once you can get past a certain point it can really help them to take off. They are now just below the take-off zone, but if they can get to above 25% and 30% then the electoral impact is enormous and could translate into hundreds of seats in the Commons.”In words that will come as a boost to Reform as it tries to professionalise, and will strike fear into the hearts of those on the mainstream right and left of UK politics, he added: “With this current combination of three parties being in the mid-20s, it is a very unusual sort of electoral weather formation. If you were trying to design a scenario in which a party like Reform overturned the established two-party duopoly, it would look rather like this.”Explore more on these topicsReform UKNigel FaragenewsShareReuse this content"

Here are the key players at the top.First circleZia YusufA former entrepreneur who founded a concierge company, the new Reform chair, aged 38, is in charge of day-to-day operations and has overseen a drive to professionalise the party. He has hired his own chief of staff, Matthew MacKinnon, a Welsh former Conservative who in 2012 was given a civil ban from football grounds after pleading guilty to disorder.The ban was lifted two years later after he made an application to end it.Nick CandyA developer who owns the most expensive property in the UK, valued at about £150m, Candy is Reform’s treasurer. He has personally pledged a seven-figure sum to the party and spearheaded a fundraising drive among wealthy donors. His importance to Farage was underlined by him accompanying the party leader on a US trip to see Elon Musk in December. Reform says “Candy has no operational involvement in the party beyond helping raise funds.”A photo of Nigel Farage with two circles radiating out from him with pictures of his ‘first circle’ right-hand men and ‘second circle’ inner influencersSecond circleArron BanksA former Ukip donor and a Trump supporter, Banks has not donated for a while. However, he is still in Farage’s coterie, attending big events and moving in the same Maga circles in the US.George CottrellSomewhat mysteriously, Cottrell has no official role in the party, though he is regularly at Farage’s side. He often turns up at events slightly before the party leader and has been present on the sidelines of recent press conferences. Cottrell, 31, has previously been convicted of wire fraud in the US. His mother donated £500,000 to Reform last year.Dan JukesA longterm aide to Farage, he has had the job title of director of communications since the age of 19. Now 28, he has been a constant during the leader’s political career, covering his time in the European parliament and as part of Leave.EU, the unofficial Brexit campaign.Richard TiceThe party’s deputy leader, Tice is still friendly with Farage despite having been replaced by him as leader last year, though insiders say the pair are not as close as they were. Tice became the MP for Boston and Skegness in Lincolnshire last year.Reform MPsThe other MPs areLee Anderson,James McMurdockandRupert Lowe, who are important figureheads for the party but not part of Farage’s core circle.Lowe is a former Southampton football club chair and the MP for Great Yarmouth, who enjoys a cult following among some Reform supporters and has been endorsed by Musk as an alternative leader.Anderson, the MP for Ashfield in Nottinghamshire, was a high-profile defector from the Tories, having previously been a Labour staffer.The backroom teamThe party’s media operation is crucial. As well as Jukes, it includesAaron Lobo, a former GB News and LBC producer, who is now a freelancer but integral to Reform’s operation.Others areEd Sumner, another Welsh former Tory, who runs Reform’s press operation, andJack Anderton, a digital chief specialising in YouTube and social media.ArchieManners, a prankster and magician, is helping with TikTok and other social media.Graham Young, a former gamekeeper, andAdam Boundsare Reform’s national campaign managers.The party has installed a number of former Tories in key roles. Its head of policy is a former Conservative candidate,Simon Marcus, who last ran in 2015.Richard Murphywas poached from Conservative campaign headquarters (CCHQ) to run a new “centre of excellence for candidates”.Michael Hadwen, a veteran of Robert Jenrick’s Conservative leadership campaign, andLuigi Murton, another former CCHQ Tory, are also working on strategy. One insider said the only senior woman at Reform HQ isKiera Hubbard, who runs events, although the party insists it has many female employees in its headquarters and elsewhere.OthersSome higher-profile figures have left the party, such as the former co-deputy leader Ben Habib and Howard Cox, the party’s 2024 London mayoral candidate, but others act as media outriders or have come to the fore.Ann Widdecombe, the former Conservative minister, andAndrea Jenkyns, the former Tory MP and now Reform’s mayoral candidate in Lincolnshire, are key figures.Rael Braverman, the husband of the Conservative former home secretary Suella Braverman, recently joined Reform and was at theparty’s fundraiser in Mayfairlast month.Explore more on these topicsReform UKNigel FarageArron BanksRichard TiceLee AndersonexplainersShareReuse this content"

Six weeks later, he was dead, and a co-worker charged with his murder. Now his partner is struggling to make sense of what happenedByWill ColdwellSat 15 Feb 2025 02.00 ESTShareIn October 2022, Robbie Robson, 38, a British offshore worker, travelled to Qatar for an eight-week contract in the oilfields of the Persian Gulf. Robson was handsome, ambitious, and determined to do well by his family. The job was an attractive opportunity: after years working on vessels, and as a pipelayer, he was pursuing safer and more lucrative positions piloting the remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) that are used to monitor underwater structures. It was a long stint away, but at least he’d be back to enjoy Christmas in South Tyneside with his partner, Kristie Graham, 39, her daughter Willow, 10, and Sefa, their 17-month-old son, in the new house they’d just bought.Until then, his home would be theSeafox Burj, a three-legged jack-up rig planted in the shallow waters of the Al-Shaheen oil field, 80km from land. Robson hated being away, but stayed connected to Graham and his friends over WhatsApp. From his vantage point in the middle of the Gulf, he’d take photos of dramatic sunsets and send them to Graham. It was a window into the strange world of offshore workers and a sign, for her, of the way he could always find the positive in any situation.Yet aspects of this particular job were wearing on him. When he first arrived on the Burj, he was surprised to learn that he was to be sharing a cabin with two other men, who, like him, were working for Film-Ocean, a Scottish subsea contractor that supplies ROVs (they look a bit like a box of propellers and robotic arms) and personnel to projects around the world. One of the men, Christopher Begley, 38, was a rosy-cheeked chap from Scotland. They got on well, bonding over football. There were no problems with the third team member either, but after a week or two, he had to leave the rig due to illness. His replacement was Scott Forrest, 44, another Scottish oil man. Forrest was a large guy, well over 6ft tall, but he didn’t make a big impression on Robson, who described him to Graham as “a bit boring”.Robson expressed his frustration to Graham about living conditions on the rigLike most cabins on rigs and vessels, Room 230 on the Burj was small and simple: four bunks with privacy curtains and a desk. But the men, who were working nights, were on the same shift rotation. After 12 hours on the job, they’d bundle into the cabin. Their sleep was frequently disrupted by the rig’s alarm system, which would blast through a public address system in their room. By Robson’s account, it was “oversensitive” – reacting to gas sensors he believed were well within safe levels – but each time it sounded they’d have to respond as if it was an emergency. Robson would send Graham pictures of himself in full breathing apparatus on the helipad: “We’re back on the deck again … ” It could take up to an hour before the crew were allowed back down. Sometimes this would repeat four or five times during the day, when the ROV team were meant to be sleeping.Robson expressed his frustration to Graham. “He said it was an absolute joke,” she says. “[That] I can’t believe this is the expectation for eight weeks.” She encouraged him to complain, which he did, but he was told there was no alternative accommodation available. As Graham understood it, there was no animosity between the men. “He wasn’t happy with the situation,” says Graham, “but he made the best of it.”Six weeks after he set foot on the rig, Robson would be dead, Begley in hospital, and Forrest in a Qatari jail charged with murder.The last time Graham and Robson spoke was 11 December 2022. Graham awoke that morning to a message wishing her happy birthday, a delivery of flowers at the door; whenever he was away, Robson prepared well for the moments he’d miss. Graham took the children to her parents’ house, but it wasn’t until later that day that she and Robson finally managed to talk. It was a 10-minute chat on the phone; the children were tired and it was a school night, so they decided to keep it brief. Robson told Graham he’d call her back at the end of his shift. He never did.View image in fullscreenKirstie Graham photographed near her home in South Tyneside.Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The GuardianAround the time Graham was putting the kids to bed, Robson was, most likely, sitting at the desk in Room 230, working at a computer. That’s where he was at 11pm Arabia Standard Time, when Forrest entered the room behind him. Earlier that day, Forrest, who had been sleeping, had awoken in a state of panic. According to his account, given to the Qatari police, this was caused by lack of sleep; his mind had been disturbed “by the sound of the sea” and the repeated alarms. Forrest was, he said, convinced there were people on the rig who were going to attack him. Roaming the Burj in search of an item to protect himself, he had found a 10kg weight used to provide ballast to the ROVs, which he had stashed in the cabin. Now he raised the iron bar and struck Robson repeatedly, killing him with multiple blows to the head. Forrest wrapped Robson’s body up in towels and concealed him in one of the beds. Then he went to the canteen.Begley was there, eating at one of the tables. Forrest calmly sat down beside him. Begley declined to be interviewed for this piece, but according to court documents, he asked Forrest where Robson was, and was told that Robson was feeling unwell and was taking a rest. Forrest then returned to the cabin, where he continued to clean up the crime scene. Shortly afterwards, Begley headed off to check on Robson. Opening the cabin door, he noticed clean towels on the side; the curtain to Robson’s bunk was drawn shut. Then Forrest attacked again, striking Begley from behind with the weight. Begley took two blows to his head, but fought back. The men struggled. “Sorry, I have to do this,” Forrest told him. This time, though, the commotion roused the attention of other crew members. “They had to break down the door,” Begley’s father, Dennis, told the Scottish Sun, “but they were able to get the attacker off of him. They probably saved his life.”Begley was hurried to the first aid room, and the rig captain, Dean Young, was informed. By now, though, Forrest was ready to give himself up. According to court documents, he arrived at Young’s office to declare he had a problem. “Is this the assault problem?” Young asked. Forrest replied that there was another thing: he had killed Robson. A guard was placed on the office door, and Young went to check Room 230. The curtain to the bunk was pulled back, and Robson’s body was found. Attempts were made to revive him, but it was too late.View image in fullscreenRobson in 2020, on his 36th birthday. Photograph: courtesy of Kristie GrahamBy dawn, the Qatari police were on a helicopter to the Burj. As an arrest was made, Begley was transported to hospital, and Robson’s body taken to the mainland, news was already spreading among the close-knit offshore community. One oil and gas worker showed me a screenshot of a message apparently sent by an onshore project manager in Qatar who was dealing with the incident: “Need some help … got a situation I don’t think anyone in this industry has experienced … ”Back in the UK, Graham was still unaware of the events that had taken place that night. In the morning, there were no messages from Robson. By midday, she was starting to grow worried. “Something just felt different,” she says. Throughout the day, Graham continued to message Robson, asking him to call back. A friend reassured her that the lack of response was probably just a problem with the comms system on the rig. But if the comms were down, Graham thought, then his phone wouldn’t be ringing out when she called. “And then it wasn’t ringing,” she says. “And I was like: ‘That’s just not right.’”At 10pm, the police knocked on her door.Today, Graham is living in the house she and Robson bought before he died. It’s on a quiet street in Cleadon, not far from Roker beach, with its pier that curls into the North Sea. The ­renovations they planned have been completed, and­ framed ­photos line the crisply painted hallway, Robson smiling in them. When I visit in August, Graham has just got back from the gym she owns with her sister – she’s poised, smartwatch on her wrist. We’re joined by their friend, Andrew Quinn, 40, who has just finished a coast-to-coast run in memory of Robson, and we sit around a breakfast bar as they describe the close-knit friendship group they all shared since school. Graham and Robson had known each other for years before they got together in 2019. Life since then, she says, was “beautiful … and so much fun”.Robson, they tell me, was someone with a zest for life, always joking. When the pandemic hit, says Graham, it was the first time they could spend several months together as a couple without him having to go offshore, and he brought a lightness to the house, hiding tiny water pistols so they could jump out and surprise each other: “And the bond he had with Willow, I don’t think she would have got through the pandemic without Robbie’s jokes.” Robson’s boundless social energy was matched by his enthusiasm for trying new things. He  was “all the gear and no idea”, says Quinn, and the loft, Graham pointedly adds, is full of it: paddleboards, kayaks, snowboards, decks, hundreds of records …Robson applied the same focus to his career. Growing up in the north-east, says Graham, the jobs are at sea: “If you know a hundred people, half of them will be connected to offshore work.” But he was, Quinn says, a homebody at heart. Being stuck on rigs for weeks on end could be a struggle. By his early 30s, Robson was eager to take on more stimulating, better-paid work. Two of his close friends were already working as ROV pilots, and Robson wanted to follow suit. With their encouragement, he threw himself into the challenge. Now, when he was away, his cabin would be full of schematics, stacks of books, paperwork; at home it was the same story.At first, most of Robson’s work had been in the North Sea – on rigs and vessels, working two or three weeks offshore followed by the same amount of time back home. When he started taking on ROV work, it became more erratic, as Robson jumped on opportunities whenever they became available to build up his experience. It took him everywhere: Texas, Borneo … “All over,” says Graham, and the time away grew longer, too: “Eight weeks on, two weeks off. Then he’d get a different job and it was 10 weeks on, six days back at home.”After Graham and Robson became a couple, and Sefa was born, he became even more determined. Robson was racing to pass his ROV “competencies” and get to a position that would finally give him more control over the jobs he took. Graham had always been supportive of his work, but it had been hard raising Sefa with him away for so long. Robson had missed a lot, too. That was one of the reasons he went to Qatar, says Graham: “He said: ‘This is my last long job away.’”Since Robson’s death, the friendship group has tightened. Graham, Quinn and a number of others now share the same tattoo bearing Robson’s initials. In the immediate aftermath, Quinn was on the phone to the British embassy, and friends with connections in the industry did their best to help Graham find out more. The flow of information did not come readily, and navigating the Qatari legal system from afar was a nightmare of its own. Graham and Robson were unmarried, so she was not recognised as family. She was involved in initial introductions to a solicitor, but after that, Graham says, “They didn’t acknowledge anything I said. I had to go through Denise and Rob, Robbie’s parents, saying, ‘Can you send this? Ask this?’, because every email I sent I got nothing back.”For a long time, Graham believed she would have to fly to Qatar for the trial; she was having nightmares about the prospect of facing Forrest in court. But the dates kept changing, and she was eventually advised that, since it would be a brief hearing rather than the lengthy jury trial you would expect in the UK, it might be easier to remain at home (in a Qatari criminal case of this kind, three judges are presented with evidence and decide on a verdict and sentence). The option to accept compensation from Forrest was raised by the solicitor (the award of “blood money” is common practice in Qatar, and the figure put forward was QR200,000, about £43,000), but it was rejected by the family.A court report found the killer had a ‘psychotic episode due to an inability to get regular sleep for weeks’At first, charges of premeditated murder were on the table. Graham was told that Forrest could expect to receive the death penalty. But when the judgment and sentencing hearing finally took place, on 27 December 2023, the judges were swayed by a psychiatric assessment of Forrest, conducted six months after the crime had taken place. It found no sign of neurological conditions that could have explained his behaviour, nor evidence of drug or alcohol abuse. It noted that by Forrest’s own account, he had a “good relationship” with his two colleagues on the rig, and “no significant disagreements” happened between them. The working conditions, however, were described as “unusually difficult”. The challenging sleeping arrangement and night shifts were exacerbated by the alarms, which could go off up to eight times a day, putting the workers “under unprecedented nervous pressure”. A feeling of panic and paranoia, Forrest said, began to build in him the day before the murder. By then, he was “living in a dream”.The report concluded that “it was most likely Forrest was suffering from an acute psychotic episode … caused by the inability to get sufficient rest and regular sleep for weeks on end, in addition to severe nervous pressure caused by a turbulent work environment”. If proven, it stated, his responsibility for the crime “is partial”. The court agreed. Forrest was convicted of murder without intent – comparable to manslaughter – and received a 10-year sentence, after which time he will be deported back to the UK.Graham couldn’t believe it. To her, 10 years did not seem like justice. As she saw it, Forrest had hidden the murder weapon in advance – evidence that the crime was premeditated. She also learned that the day before the attack, Forrest had made a request to leave the rig on a scheduled helicopter due to depart hours after the murder. She believes he had planned his escape. Forrest had said he was dealing with a family emergency, but “the police checked his phone and there was no sign of any emergency”, says Graham. It was disturbing to Graham that Forrest was taken at his word when he described having no memory of his actions at the time – and that his mental state was only assessed months afterwards. The family lodged two appeals, but they were unsuccessful.Since then, Graham has grown increasingly distrustful of the process. The solicitor was appointed by Film-Ocean to act for the family – in hindsight, she wishes they had obtained one independently. Graham had to push to see the full court files, and when she was finally able to access the information, months later, she struggled to make sense of it. “A lot of things don’t add up.”Film-Ocean, which in a statement at the time described the incident as “non-work related”, was initially supportive of Graham, helping to repatriate Robson and pay for the legal costs, but when the murder charge was downgraded, Graham says it went quiet. She is now pursuing a civil case against Film-Ocean, which she believes failed in its duty of care. (When contacted for this article, Film-Ocean said it was unable to comment while the litigation was ongoing, except to say that it did not consider Graham’s account to be an accurate reflection of events.)Graham cannot accept that Forrest’s actions amounted to anything less than murder, but she still finds herself wondering if Robson would be alive were his complaints about the cabin sharing taken more seriously. Why were the crew expected to endure conditions that were evidently causing discomfort? Why were Robson’s complaints ignored? Was it really a freak occurrence, or does the industry have a case to answer?View image in fullscreenGraham photographed at home.Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The Guardian‘People are going away for months at a time,’ says Graham. ‘Working and living conditions should be above par. Not just: Get what you’re given and shut up’Freelancers like Robson follow work wherever it leads, often into jurisdictions with varying levels of oversight. In many ways, companies like Film-Ocean do the same; both are part of the byzantine network of agencies, contractors and operators that keep offshore projects running. It’s an intensely competitive industry. In the race to secure work, employee wellbeing may not always be the first priority.“These people are going away for weeks and months at a time, away from their family, sacrificing a lot,” says Graham. “The working conditions and the living conditions should be above par. Not just, ‘Get what you’re given and shut up.’”Few working environments come as intense as an oil rig. They are combustible places, literally and figuratively. The intensity of the work, pumping fuel from beneath the ocean floor, is matched by the psychological challenge of long periods spent with strangers in an isolated setting. As Jake Molloy, who has recently retired after decades working offshore and as an RMT union leader in Scotland, puts it: “There’s a saying: ‘I can work with you, but I don’t have to like you.’ That doesn’t apply offshore.”For the most part, it’s a fraternal community. Arguments can occur, but serious violence is rare. More often, the turmoil is silently whirring within a worker’s own head. Offshore workers are 15 times more likely to die by suicide than those working on land; 40% experience suicidal thoughts. “People just disappear and you find them, days later, in some corner of the rig,” says Molloy. “The environment, the isolation, enables that.”In the UK, workers should work for two to three weeksbefore getting the same amount of time off. Cabin sharing is normal, but it should usually be no more than two people, working opposite shifts, or “back to back”, so when one person is sleeping, they have the cabin to themselves. These regulations are rooted in an understanding of the importance of quality rest and privacy for the wellbeing of workers and their safety.Beyond the North Sea, in Africa and the Middle East, it is normal for offshore workers to spend much longer stints away from land. A four-week rotation is normal, but a job could easily push to six, or longer still. (Expat oil and gas workers from western countries tend to enjoy far better terms than migrant workers from countries like Pakistan or the Philippines.) And while the industry as a whole has significantly improved its safety record, Molloy claims that when it comes to “mental health, occupational health, the ability to get quality of rest, quality of sleep … they’re failing, absolutely miserably.”View image in fullscreenGraham and Robson in the Lake District for her 38th birthday. Photograph: courtesy of Kristie GrahamRobson got his work in the Gulf through an agency called Tech Professionals (which is also named in the family’s civil action). Based in Banbury, Oxfordshire, it supplies engineers and technical specialists to subsea and offshore projects around the world. That’s how Robson was offered a contract with Film-Ocean, a relatively small independent contractor based in Ellon, Scotland, and one of many firms hustling for work from offshore operators; it owns assets, like ROVs, ploughs and trenches, and hires them out. In this case, it was providing services for the NorthOilCompany, a joint venture between QatarEnergy and TotalEnergies. (The rig itself was owned by Seafox, a Dutch firm.)Rob Pattenden, director of Tech Professionals, denies the agency failed in its duty of care, stating that it was in contact with Robson throughout the contract and was not made aware of any complaints. The project, he says, was typical of many of the contracts undertaken by its contractors, “up until the moment that a disturbed individual carried out a violent and unprovoked attack”. He adds that “nothing that we could have done would have ever prevented such a tragic and unforeseen incident”.When asked to clarify if it is considered standard for three crew members on the same rotation to be sharing a cabin, and whether Robson was aware this would be the case before he arrived on the rig, Pattenden will not comment, citing ongoing legal action, but says: “Whilst the most common form of accommodation for offshore work is single accommodation, it’s certainly not unusual for cabins to be shared.”While agencies often supply the manpower, it is contractors like Film-Ocean that tender for work from the big oil and gas operators. Some industry voices tell me that in the race to win contracts, firms can over-promise at the expense of the wellbeing of the crew. I speak to one offshore worker (who asked to remain anonymous) with close to a decade’s experience working for firms, including Film-Ocean. He tells me that a contractor might send a smaller crew to keep the cost down and win the contract, and say, “‘Those guys will just work whenever you need them.’ Instead of saying, ‘These guys have to work 12 hours on then 12 hours off.’” Clarity over the conditions once you are out there is sometimes lacking, too. “Basically, they just stick an ROV on a ship, send it to Qatar, send the guys over and go, ‘Crack on’ … ” he says.Sometimes, he adds, there might be empty rooms on the rig, but to save money on cleaning they’ll still have four men in a cabin. Since the incident on the Burj, he says, he knows of other people being sent on jobs by Film-Ocean on the understanding that they wouldn’t be sharing cabins, only to discover, on arrival, that they were. Film-Ocean did not provide a response to this claim.The majority of the workers I speak to insist on anonymity for fear of repercussions. A history of blacklisting has long cast a shadow over the sector; it is understood that workers who cause too many difficulties – or raise concerns about safety or conditions – can be swiftly booted back to land with the letters NRB marked next to their name: “Not Required Back”.Robson, says Graham, was usually cautious about what he said and to whom he said it – “because of the knock-on effect for the next jobs” – but for an eight-week contract the situation felt unacceptable. He did speak up, first complaining to Begley, who was his supervisor. Begley escalated it to someone higher on the rig and, when he was told nothing could be done, Robson went directly to Film-Ocean, Graham says. She and Robson talked about this over the phone, she says, and a sense of the challenges on the rig can also be gleaned from text messages between the two of them.In one exchange in late October, Graham asks if he’s still sharing a room, to which Robson replies: “Moving tomorrow”. (Graham told me that she believes at one point Robson thought he might be given a new cabin.)Later, on the morning of 4 November, Robson messages to say that someone else, whom he doesn’t know, had been in the room when he was meant to be asleep. “Can’t see me lasting here if four people are meant to be in this room,” he says. “Not a chance.”“I’m sorry you’re having a rough ride there,” Graham replies.“Going to message the beach [industry slang for ‘onshore’] and tell them they need to sort this otherwise am going,” says Robson.The disruption continued: in late November, Robson described feeling “wrecked” from lack of sleep. “If they had listened to the complaints Robbie had put forward, and the suggestion that the men were split up, this would probably never have happened,” says Graham.It may be that Forrest, too, was a product of a system that operates under perpetual pressure to keep the taps flowing. Hailing from Maud, a village in Aberdeenshire, Scotland, Forrest climbed the career ladder working for numerous subsea contractors. At the time he was working on the Burj, he was living in Thailand, where he has a wife and children. On his CV, he describes himself as someone who “enjoys being part of … a team”, and who “thrives in highly pressurised and challenging working environments”.Friends and colleagues also suggested he was a man of good temperament. They were shocked to hear he had been responsible for such an outburst of violence. Forrest, they told me, may have been a physically imposing man, but he was “a gentle giant”. None could fathom how the events that took place on the Burj came about.But a number of people who knew or worked with Forrest, again speaking under condition of anonymity, suggested that in the runup to the incident on the Burj, he had been working increasingly longer stints offshore with shorter periods back home. This pattern began during the pandemic, when Covid restrictions and quarantine measures meant that workers faced pressure to remain offshore, or spend their rest periods on rigs or vessels. I was told of one diver who spent 10 months offshore during this period.In Qatar, restrictions were not fully lifted until late 2022, just in time for the football World Cup. When the incident happened, one source told me, Forrest was coming to the end of a five- or six-month period offshore. I was unable to confirm how much time Forrest had spent on land before taking the position on the Seafox Burj, but David (not his real name), a manager for an offshore contractor who lives in Thailand and was friendly with Forrest, believed his workload had escalated that year. A few weeks before the incident on the Burj, David had spoken to a mutual colleague and exchanged messages with Forrest about how things were going. The impression he got was that Forrest “was burned out from being offshore too long. Crew changes were not possible because of Covid. Threats from employers that if you don’t go back, you’ll never get a job again.” Film-Ocean did not provide a response to this claim, and North Oil Company did not respond to any requests for comment.It has been more than two years since Robson’s death. As time rolls on, Graham is learning that the oil and gas industry does not lend itself to transparency. A full account of the incident remains obscure. Film-Ocean would not comment when asked if it had conducted a review of its workplace policies, and North Oil Company is yet to release a statement. Perhaps, as the companies involved suggest, this was a tragedy that came out of nowhere – a random outburst of violence. Even so, there are details that deserve scrutiny, questions that could not only help Graham make sense of her loss, but may benefit other workers in the industry. Could Robson’s death have been prevented? Are there lessons to be learned? She may be waiting some time for answers.Graham remains steadfast. “People have said, ‘Are you going up against an oil company? You’ve got no chance,’” she says. “Well, if somebody doesn’t stand up to them then nobody ever will. No family should ever have to go through this.”In the meantime, this multibillion-dollar industry ploughs on, a constant stream of workers coming, going – sometimes disappearing altogether. It isn’t stopping now, and it didn’t stop in December 2022, either. Two days after Robson was killed, Graham told me, a different agency was hiring for a replacement.Explore more on these topicsOil and gas companiesOilfeaturesShareReuse this content"

He considers this important enough to include in the eccentric mission statement pictogram he devised to “capture how Ineos works, and why”.The Ineos Compass, which he devised in 2022,includes a dizzying array of words and phrases, divided between those that Ratcliffe likes (“a beer”, “out of the box thinking”, “doggedness”) and those that he doesn’t (“politics”, “losing money”, “people who get on the bus”). If there are clues to Ratcliffe’s vertiginous rise and recent troubles they might be here.Ratcliffe became one of Britain’s wealthiest men after building a chemicals empire from the £84m purchase of a single Belgian oil refinery in 1998. In the years that followed the engineering graduate turned private equity executive continued to snap up the cut-price assets that big fossil fuel companies no longer wanted.Today theIneoschemicals conglomerate is expansive and opaque. It is made up of about 30 distinct companies, each with their own chief executive, which together operate more than 170 sites across 32 countries. This federal structure appears to be woven together through a system of loans and dividends that allow the cash-rich behemoths of Ratcliffe’s empire to support its weaker areas. Ultimately, dividends flow upwards to a holding company controlled by Ratcliffe alongside rich-list regulars Andy Currie and John Reece, who each own a 20% stake.For years the system worked. Ratcliffe’s early gamble on the chemicals industry at the turn of the millennium coincided with a decades long profit boom in the industry. For the last 20 years producing chemicals has generated returns well above those of the broader capital markets, according to research from the consulting group McKinsey.The billions made from producing the chemical building blocks essential for modern life have been used to expand the company’s reach to include more familiar emblems of masculinity. There is Ratcliffe’s string of sporting teams as well as the fashion brand Belstaff, known for its leather jackets, and theIneos Grenadier 4x4 off-roader. Depending on who you ask these are either passion projects or vanity ventures. By either definition, many are now in financial peril at a time when the easy earnings of the chemical industry have become more difficult.The industry reached a peak shortly before the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic, which shut down global economies and triggered a collapse in refinery earnings. There was another steep dive after the global energy crisis triggered by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine three years ago, which caused costs to rocket to record highs and remain inflated today.View image in fullscreenJim Ratcliffe at the unveiling of the Ineos Fusilier electric SUV outside the Grenadier pub in London.Photograph: Bloomberg/Getty ImagesThe change in fortunes has decimated earnings at the largest Ineos companies. The most recent accounts from Ineos Group, its Luxembourg-based business, show that its profit before tax plunged by €1.87bn in 2023 to €407.8m, compared with €2.28bn for the same period in 2022. Its largest UK company, Ineos Industries, slumped to a loss of just over €1bn in 2023 from a profit of €1.5bn the year before. One of the company’s subsidiaries, Ineos Quattro, reported a loss of €203.1m in 2023, from a profit of €1.96bn, and admitted it was “significantly indebted”. It owed €7.33bn, more than double its total equity of €3.25bn.The credit ratings agencies Fitch and Moody’shave raised red flags over the outlook for the group’s financial health, too. At Ineos Group alone the debt pile is expected to climb to almost €12bn (£10bn) this year, according to Fitch, or more than five times its earnings. The agency said there was “uncertainty” over the plan to repay related-party loans of £800m to other parts of the Ineos business empire. The company’s unrestricted cash of €2.3bn should easily cover the €500m of debt due within the next 12 months, Fitch added.Still, the warnings are a stark reminder of the 2008 financial crisis, when the company was forced to beg its banks to waive the repayment terms on the $9bn it borrowed to buy BP’s refining business to avoid bankruptcy. Ineos has described the period as the “darkest moment in the company’s history”.Ratcliffe blamed high energy costs, “the deindustrialisation of Europe” and “extreme carbon taxes” earlier this week for the company’sstruggle to make its sponsorship paymentsto the All Blacks rugby team, in a defence that will be familiar to the industry.Steve Elliott, the chief executive of the Chemicals Industry Association, said: “We are experiencing the most challenging of times in terms of uncompetitive input costs, suppressed demand and, it has to be said, a manufacturing-unfriendly policy and regulatory environment. All with no immediate end in sight.”“Every chemical business across the UK is paying more for its energy than competitors elsewhere – as much as 400% higher than in America – with the added challenge of a hugely ambitious net zero transition timeline and hostile policy agenda,” Elliott added.View image in fullscreenJim Ratcliffe (centre) visits the Grangemouth gas terminal in Scotland. Ineos is planning to close the oil refining facility at the site.Photograph: Russell Cheyne/ReutersThe struggles of the petroleum business have been most evident in Scotland, where Ineos isplanning to close the refining arm of Grangemouth, a joint venture with the state-owned PetroChina, with the imminent loss of more than 400 jobs. About 80 people will be left to handle petrol imports.The Scottish government is still thought to be negotiating with the company to avoid the job losses, although its prospects for success appear limited without big subsidies. Questions have been raised in parliament over why the government hasguaranteed a €700m (£582m) loanto help Ineos build a whole new refinery in Antwerp, while not offering enough to support jobs in Scotland. The Unite union has proposed a plan to convert the refinery operations to produce sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) for jets.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It was not Grangemouth, but rather Teesside that she said would get the jobs. In the same speech, Reeves said the government was backing plans for the redevelopment of the Old Trafford stadium.The redevelopment is an important part of Ratcliffe’s plans for Manchester United, after he took control at the end of 2023. He has set about cutting costs dramatically in what he has described internally as necessary moves toprevent the club from going bustand return it to its former trophy-winning strength.View image in fullscreenRatcliffe’s plans to redevelop Manchester United’s Old Trafford stadium.Photograph: Conor Molloy/ProSports/Rex/ShutterstockOne of the biggest drains on Ineos’s coffers is its car business. Ratcliffe set up Ineos Automotive to create a new off-road vehicle after Land Rover’s owner JLR turned its rugged Defender into a premium SUV.Yet even billionaires have struggled to build new car companies. James Dyson, a fellow super-rich manufacturer (and another Brexit backer) said heblew £500m on building an electric carthat never took to roads. Ratcliffe appears to have outdone him: Ineos Automotive has burned through €1.4bn since 2018, and it had another €2.3bn in debt at the end of 2023.That was before the collapse of a seat supplier in September forced it to pause production for three months. A person with knowledge of its operations said the company was ramping up production at its factory in France (which waschosen ahead of a plant in south Wales) although it had been affected by the slow demand felt across the car industry.Sport and cars are not Ineos’s only side hustles: in 2022 Ineos bought Ratcliffe’s favourite pub, the Grenadier in London’s exclusive Belgravia, before using its name for Ineos’s car. The early 18th-century pub is famous (possibly erroneously) for generations of punters sticking money to the ceiling to pay off the debts of a soldier killed for cheating at gambling.Ghost-hunting revellers are perhaps more likely to spot Ratcliffe, who came up with the idea of building the car there. The pub reported a loss of £1.4m in 2023, despite Ineos Automotive spending €400,000 there, according to company accounts.Ineos did not respond to a request for comment.Explore more on these topicsJim RatcliffeChemical industryManufacturing sectorAutomotive industryManchester UnitedIneosfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Billing complaints peaked in 2023 at 67,295, but are still higher than before the Covid pandemic.Formal billing complaints decided against Centrica, the parent company of British Gas, have increased sixfold since 2019.That year, the ombudsman found against it in relation to 2,396 complaints about billing, while between October 2023 and September 2024, the last 12 months for which there is available data, the number rose to 17,965.British Gas is the UK’s largest energy provider, with more than 7.5 million residential customers. But even when the number of accounts are considered, it still ranked highest among the major providers, with a complaint rate of 53.7 for every 100,000 customers in the last three months’ data.Compensation for billing complaints over the five years rose from about £2.4m in 2019 to £7.1m.Over the whole period, a total of £20.4m was paid out by the biggest energy companies and the largest proportion, £4.15m of the total, was paid out by Centrica.View image in fullscreenFormal billing complaints decided against Centrica, the parent company of British Gas, have increased sixfold since 2019.Photograph: Rui Vieira/PAIn the latest period for which data was available, it paid out about £2.22m in compensation over billing disputes. Over the same period, Ovo paid out £1.28m and EDF £426,000.The millions of pounds being paid out are “time and trouble” awards – compensation for the inconvenience and stress caused to customers, not the sums wrongly billed in the first place.The fuel poverty charity National Energy Action says that the complaints may not show the full scale of the problem.Its director of policy, Peter Smith, says: “Sadly, we have witnessed the impact when an inaccurate, or shock bill, pushes a vulnerable consumer to breaking point. Beyond the financial impact, the stress and anxiety are often unbearable and affect people’s daily lives.“Often these types of consumers won’t be aware of routes to challenge misbilling, or seek compensation, so this increase could just be the tip of the iceberg.”British Gas says the sector as a whole has recorded an increase in complaints since 2019, and that its complaint rates have fallen to be broadly in line with other suppliers after it invested in its customer service.The Energy Ombudsman says: “The sector has faced a series of challenges since 2020, including Covid-19, specific supplier failures, and then huge increases in the cost of gas and electricity.“Each of these has brought new problems for both consumers and suppliers, and makes it harder for both sides to come to a resolution when disputes arise.“It’s important to note that disputes have started to come down from their peak in 2023, despite remaining higher than previous years.“This trend, as well as the continuing challenges in the sector, demonstrate the need for suppliers to continue to work to resolve issues directly with consumers.”View image in fullscreenInstalling a smart meter greatly reduces your chance of being inaccurately billed.Photograph: Ron Bull/AlamySeparate data from Citizens Advice shows a 472% increase in complaints made against dual-fuel energy companies between 2013 and 2023, though it notes that this does not reflect their outcome.Alex Belsham-Harris, the head of energy policy at Citizens Advice, says: “Our advisers often hear from people who are barely making ends meet, and an inaccurate bill not only risks plunging them into debt, but can take huge effort and stress to resolve.“Energy consumers simply can’t afford to pick up the tab when something goes wrong. Ofgem must limit back-billing to curb the amount customers can be charged, and it should raise service standards so people struggling with billing issues get the help they need.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This is an increase from 47,373 in 2023, and 24,407 in 2020.Smith adds: “We also know that installing a smart meter, or taking regular meter readings, both greatly reduce your chance of being inaccurately billed, and helps you to challenge it in the case you are.“It’s one of the key reasons we support the ongoing rollout of smart meters and want the national programme to be a success.”‘They’re just making it so difficult to pay the bill’View image in fullscreenFran Wescombe had problems over direct debits for her British Gas bills.Photograph: Fran WescombeFran Wescombe knows all too well about problems with energy billing, having seen several things going wrong since she moved into a flat with her partner in Watford, Hertfordshire, in December 2023. The previous tenants were with British Gas, so Wescombe got in contact with the energy provider and set herself up as the bill payer. The flat was all electric and she was told the bills would be roughly £105 a month. She would pay in full by phone each month after getting the bill in the post.Bills cost between £100 and £160 a month, but the June bill seemed low at £93.88. She got in touch and was told she would be sent a key so she could read the meter. She says the key did not arrive.At the end of August she was hit with a £503 bill. It said someone had been to read the meter. “They were all estimated bills, and they now wanted to charge us accordingly,” Wescombe says.British Gas confirmed on the phone that someone had been out, though neither she nor her landlord had authorised it. “He [the call handler] said that he was going to instruct a new engineer to come out to reread the meter, and that someone would call me back the next day by 3pm to set up when would be a convenient time for this reading to take place.”During this call, she arranged to set up a direct debit to help manage the backlog.However, in November, Wescombe got another bill for just over £500 and realised the direct debits had not been taken, so she was falling further into arrears.She called British Gas again, which confirmed the direct debit had not been taken. The company says “it was set up but not activated at the time, and it’s unclear as to why this was”.She issued a formal complaint, and got a letter instructing her to “sit tight” as it was being looked into. Because she had not been paying anything, her outstanding bill had increased to £1,116, which she asked to pay in instalments. However, the payment was taken in full on 9 January.Wescombe contacted her bank to cancel the payment and told us she had not heard back from British Gas about her complaint.A British Gas spokesperson says: “We’re sorry for the customer service Ms Wescombe experienced. The outstanding balance built up due to estimated meter readings on the account for some time.”They added: “We’ve reached out to discuss the help and support available, and explore payment options to resolve the outstanding amount on her account.”Mabel Banfield-NwachiExplore more on these topicsEnergy billsHousehold billsConsumer affairsEnergy industryfeaturesShareReuse this content"

However,Rwandacontinues to deny its forces have crossed into the country and has repeatedly denied involvement in supporting the M23 rebels.View image in fullscreenThérèse Kayikwamba Wagner, foreign minister of the Democratic Republic of the Congo.Photograph: Lev Radin/Rex/ShutterstockWagner told the Guardian: “We offered to meet Arsenal, but they didn’t reach out or take us up on the offer. We have not received an answer. Apparently they are not interested in meeting us.”A member of a Congolese diaspora group in London, who requested not to be named, said Arsenal’s response was an “outrageous insult” to what they said were “millions” of fans in a country the size of western Europe.In contrast, another leading club with the same Rwandan sponsorship deal – Germany’s Bayern Munich – sent two employees to Rwanda to monitor the escalating situation and is in contact with the German foreign ministry.Before Wagner arrived in London she urged the owners of Arsenal to end what she called its “bloodstained” deal with Visit Rwanda.Arsenal’s current Visit Rwanda arrangement, which has been running since 2021, is believed to be worth £10m a year and will continue until next year. Visit Rwanda is an arm of the Rwanda Development Board, a government department.Rwanda’s president,Paul Kagame, is also head of its military.Last week, the Guardianexposed the extent of Rwanda’s involvementin the M23 offensive, revealing that hundreds, possibly thousands, of its troops had been killed during clandestine missions in the Congo.Rwandan troops led by the M23 recently seized the Congolese city of Goma, and are now moving south in an offensive that experts warn threatens to deepen a humanitarian catastrophe with about 700,000 people forced from their homes already this year.Signs of a concerted international response to the crisis have been slow but on Thursday the European parliament urged theEU to freeze direct budget support for Rwandauntil it breaks links with the M23 rebels.The UK foreign secretary,David Lammy, last month warnedthat Rwanda had put $1bn of global aid under threat by taking part in the invasion of the DRC. No funding, however, appears to have been withdrawn as yet.Wagner said: “Condemnations and declarations have had a limited impact when it comes to curtailing President Kagame’s actions and ambitions.”The fall of Goma: 16 days of chaos and fear – in picturesRead moreWagner met Lammy and Africa minister Lord Collins of Highbury this week and said there was a “continuous conversation” in which she was pushing for action. “Different options are being analysed but I have not had a firm promise of what is to come.“There is still an imperative for sanctions and firm action. We have a situation where a country is occupying another country and which is pillaging natural resources, is responsible for the killing of at least 3,000 civilians and also peacekeepers.“The killing has to stop, the pillaging has to stop. The crooks have toleave the DRC.”Another big European club – Paris St-Germain – is also under pressure because of its Visit Rwanda deal, withformer DRC captain Youssouf Mulumbuasking it to reconsider its partnership.View image in fullscreenProtesters call for football teams to end their Visit Rwanda deals outside the BBC Broadcasting House on 8 February.Photograph: Sopa Images/LightRocket/Getty ImagesThis week, theDRC also urged Formula One to end talks with Rwandaover hosting a race, saying the sport risks having its brand “smeared by a bloodstained association”.Arsenal’s deal with Visit Rwanda began in May 2018, when it signed a three-year deal with the Rwanda Development Board, followed byanother in 2021.Its logo appears on the shirt sleeves of Arsenal’s men’s, women’s and youth teams and can be seen on boards at the Emirates Stadium and on interview backdrops.Part of the deal has seen past and present Arsenal players visit Rwanda, most notably during August 2022 whenthe club published footage on its channelsof Ray Parlour and Robert Pires’ trip.Arsenal did not respond to requests for comment.Explore more on these topicsGlobal developmentArsenalDemocratic Republic of the CongoRwandaAfricaConflict and armsnewsShareReuse this content"

Gunfire rang out but the rebel forces encountered little resistance. Shops and businesses had long closed and frightened civilians fled.Bukavu previously fell to soldiers who deserted the Congolese army in 2004 and the capture of the city would in effect give the M23 total control of the Lake Kivu area. Its capture would represent an unprecedented expansion of territory under the M23’s control since the latest insurgency started in 2022, and deal a further blow to Kinshasa’s authority in the east.Two residents of Bagira, in the northern part of Bukavu, said they had seen rebels on the streets and no sign of fighting.“Their uniforms were different. We had been prepared since the daytime for their arrival ... The FARDC [army soldiers] had left. There were no clashes,” said resident Helene, who described watching the rebels pass by her window.Hours earlier, the rebels seized the airport in the town of Kavumu, where Congolese troops had been positioned. The Congolese army spokesperson Sylvain Ekenge said troops had pulled back after the seizure of the airport.He did not say where they had withdrawn to, but Congolese and Burundian troops were seen leaving Bukavu’s main military camp, Saio, during the day, two residents and one UN source said.Last monththe rebels took Goma, the provincial capital of North Kivu, in a similar lightning offensive.On Thursday, the group captured Kabamba and the commercial centre of Katana as they advanced south along the N2 road.Airport employees said it had been emptied and in effect closed, with Congolese forces having removed an aircraft and other equipment. Troops were seen heading back to Bukavu in military trucks and on motorbikes laden with mattresses and other belongings.Who are the M23 rebels and why is there fighting in eastern DRC?Read moreCorneille Nangaa, the head of the Congo River Alliance, a coalition of rebel groups that includes M23, said militias had been attacked and were defending themselves.Congo’s president, Félix Tshisekedi, travelled to Germany to attendthe Munich Security Conferenceon Friday as he seeks international support to end the conflict in eastern DRC.“Of course this could lead to a spillover in the region,” he warned the conference, reiterating his call forRwandato be held accountable for its role in the conflict. “It is up to the international community to prevent this conflict spreading.”He is not attending this weekend’s annual African Union summit in the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa, which is focused on efforts to halt the conflict, with the prime minister, Judith Suminwa Tuluka, taking his place.MapFighting has raged in eastern DRC for the last three years, but the recent surge in violence has prompted international calls for de-escalation and worsened an already dire humanitarian situation. The fighting has destroyed 70,000 emergency shelters around Goma and Minova in South Kivu, leaving 350,000 internally displaced people without shelter,according to the UN.M23 is the latest in a string of ethnic Tutsi-led insurgent groups that have operated in the mineral-rich eastern DRC since a 2003 deal was meant to end wars that had killed 6 million people, mostly from hunger and disease. The group is backed by Rwanda, which says its primary interest is to eradicate fighters linked to the 1994 genocide. The Congolese government and several UN reports say in fact Rwanda is using the group as a means to extract and then export valuable minerals for use in products such as mobile phones.The fighting has drawn in armies of many countries from within and outside the continent, including those that contribute to a UN peacekeeping mission. Canada announced this week it had withdrawn its military personnel from the force, citing“increasingly perilous security conditions”in Goma.On Thursday a popular Congolese singer was killed in the city while making a music video. The body of Delphin Katembo Vinywasiki, popularly known by his stage name Delcat Idengo, was found along a road near Kilijiwe district in northern Goma in the afternoon, with witnesses saying he died on the spot after being shot in the head.Social media images showed the body of Vinywasiki, dressed in military trousers for the video shoot, lying on the ground.Vinywasiki, whose songs often criticised conflict and human rights violations in DRC, was one of hundreds of prisoners who broke out of a prison in Goma during the M23 advance last month. He had been incarcerated for allegedly inciting people to arm themselves and force UN peacekeepers out of the country and was awaiting trial.The circumstances around the singer’s death are unclear. Patrick Muyaya, a DRC government spokesperson, condemned the killing, which he described as abominable. “Neither horror, nor terror, and even less the untimely resort to arms against innocent civilians will be able to extinguish the flame of resistance in Goma and throughout the country,”he wrote on X.Reuters and Agence France-Presse contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsDemocratic Republic of the CongoAfricaRwandanewsShareReuse this content"

He closed his eyes and held his breath.“When its mouth closed around me and pulled me down, I felt like I was in a whirlpool, lying down and spinning around,”he said. For a few fleeting moments, his fate was in the jaws of the 40-tonne cetacean. “If it had eaten me, I would’ve died. There was nothing I could do about it.”View image in fullscreenAdrián Simancas.Photograph: APThe terrifying ordeal lasted only a few seconds. Before he knew it, Simancas felt himself being pulled up to the surface by his lifejacket. Unhurt but shocked, he called for his father, who was paddling alongside him – and who had captured the incident on the 360-degree camera mounted to his raft.The video has since gone viral, prompting a wave of global commentary playfully comparing Simancas to figures including Pinocchio and Jonah. But it has also fuelled some misinformation about whale behaviour, causing concern within the scientific community.“Humpback whales have a small oesophagus and feed on small prey (small fish, krill), so they could not ‘devour’ or ‘swallow’ a human,” said María José Pérez Álvarez, a marine biologist at Universidad de Chile and Base Millennium Institute. She added that humpback whales do not have teeth, but rather brush-like plates they use to trap and filter their prey. “It could not have bitten him either,” she said.Although Simancas was unharmed, Pérez Álvarez cautions that human-whale interactions should be avoided at all costs: “A humpback whale is around 18 metres long. It could have hit him hard with some part of its body, even if unintentionally, and the person could have been injured.”0:57'I thought it had eaten me': humpback whale briefly swallows kayaker off the coast of Chile – videoKayakers in the area have also urged caution. Guillermo Meza operates a company specialising in kayaking tours and worries that Simancas had been too far out at sea.“I would never have gone that far into the open sea on an inflatable raft,” he said. He also warned that the two men had been far too close to the whale. “We advise maintaining distances of more than 100 metres, and if they get close to us, we stay completely still,” he said.Chilean law stipulates that legal sighting distances must be at least 100 metres from any whale. Simancas and his father are both wildlife and outdoor enthusiasts, and Simancas maintains that neither saw the whale nor intentionally approached it.“The sea was very calm. We were reaching the end of the bay when the whale appeared,” he said. “I didn’t see any schools of fish or any type of strange movements. The whale lunged from behind. It was a total surprise.”Simancas has practised pack rafting for about a year. The inflatable raft folds into a portable backpack, allowing him to combine trekking with rafting, traversing both sea and land.View image in fullscreenThe humpback whale breaks the surface near Adrián Simancas’s raft.Photograph: APCelebrating the father’s birthday, the duo had started their journey at Fin de Camino, which marks the end of the road on the continent, and one of the southernmost places in the world. Their planned route combined rafting and trekking to a small island.As one of Simancas’s paddles had been damaged in the whale encounter, they turned back and navigated their way home by holding their rafts together, with one manning the left and the other in charge of the right paddle.Simancas says that the experience has left him with a deeper respect for nature, and that he will take even greater safety precautions in future – namely, staying closer to the shoreline.“I felt blessed with a second chance to review the mistakes that led me to be there – not just in the expedition, but in life itself,” he says. But he won’t be going on any more rafting adventures this season: “I’ll wait until next year.”Explore more on these topicsEnvironmentSeascape: the state of our oceansWhalesCetaceansChileWildlifeMarine lifeAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

Worldwide requests toGooglefor content removals have more than doubled since 2020, according to cybersecurity company Surfshark.Google is one of the world’s most powerful information gatekeepers, with billions of people using its ­products such as Search, YouTube, Drive and Chrome every day.The company regularly receives requests to take down information from national and local governments globally, as well as judiciaries, police forces and military bodies.Information can be taken down for a variety of reasons, such as copyright infringement, privacy breaches, defamation, or for violating the company’s policies.Google does not publish full data on takedown requests, but it does produce a selection of summaries about certain censorship requests it believes “may be of public interest”. These summaries are included in the company’sTransparency Report, which it updates every six months.Analysis by theObserverof this report has revealed an opaque process for removing content and incomplete data. It raises questions about Google’s role in controlling public information, and in areas such as disinformation, war propaganda and geopolitics. Critics have expressed concern that Google is “playing God”, with little oversight or regulation.TheObserveranalysed the removals data for specific countries, the types of requests made, who was making them and over what time period they were made. In some cases, where Google has set out details of specific requests, these were also analysed.After national security, the majority of global takedown requests to Google since 2020 are on the grounds of copyright, and privacy and security. Thousands of requests are categorised as “other”, with no further explanation provided by Google.One removal request can be for multiple items of content. Google, whose parent company, Alphabet, made revenues of $350bn last year, also gives figures for the total items it has “named for removal”, but does not specify how many it has actually removed.In the four years to June 2024, Russia accounted for more than 60% of takedown requests.The country’sinternet censor, Roskomnadzor,is one of the government agencies that corresponds most frequently with Google – and has earned the nickname “Rosco” in some of its reports.At the behest of Roskomnadzor, the tech company removed a YouTube video that allegedly exposed “corruption among politicians” and made “some rhetorical threats of violent action against the alleged corrupt politicians”, Google’s report said.Russian citizens were also prevented from viewing certain posts on the company’s Blogger platform, which “included criticism of Russian military history and policy, and Russian patriotic holidays. It also incited violence against residents of a Russian town,” the report said.YouTube footage of Ukrainian protesters burning a Russian flag and of people insulting Russian state symbols was also taken down.View image in fullscreenLate Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny’s tactical voting recommendations were temporarily blocked by Google during the country’s September 2021 election.Photograph: Shamil Zhumatov/ReutersIn 2022, Google censored multiple YouTube videos calling for protests against Vladimir Putin’s government. Other pieces of content that criticised Putin, including the late Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny’s tactical-voting recommendations, were temporarily blocked during the September 2021 election period. Roskomnadzor “and other Russian government entities” also asked that Googleremoved Navalny’s Smart Voting appfrom its Play store, which it did.A Kremlin cabinet minister, a senator, the boss of a state-owned bank and the head of a government agency have all sought Google’s assistance to scrub information from their domestic internet. But it is not known if Google agreed or what it removed for them, and the company did not provide further information when asked.InChina, at the request of the ministry of public security, which oversees the police and domestic political spying networks, Google took down more than 200 videos. The ministry had requested removals for 412, of which 346 “contained allegations about corruption within the political system in the People’s Republic of China or stories about top government officials”.Google also assisted in China’s crackdown on free speech, removing profiles that impersonated the country’s president, Xi Jinping.Online impersonation accounts were banned in 2015after Chinese citizens used them to covertly criticise Xi and to circumvent censorship laws, which are some of the world’s most prohibitive.View image in fullscreenThe executive government of Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei asked Google to remove content in 2016 on the grounds of ‘bullying/harassment’.Photograph: APIran’s most recent request to Google was in 2016, ruled then, as now, byits supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. His executive government wanted Google to censor four pieces of content on the grounds of “bullying/harassment”. There was “no action taken” by Google, according to its report.The company has also engaged with the Afghanistan police, who contacted it 19 times in 2023, an increase of 180% from the previous year.Afghanistan wasrecaptured in 2021 by the Taliban, whose police forces include the street-patrolling “morality police”. After returning to power, the Taliban introduced new laws against slandering the government.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Google has not made public any further information about these requests and did not respond when asked for details.Harriet Moynihan, an associate fellow at the Chatham House thinktank, said: “Part of the right to freedom of expression is the right of access to information – which is restricted when censorship is in place.”Moynihan said that, even if Google was only removing content in line with its own guidelines, “there’s a strong broader point about whether Google and other technology companies should be operating and playing God in this way, with such little regulation.“Transparency is the big issue. We are only scratching the surface as researchers into what these tech companies are doing, including the use of their algorithms … The balance of power has shifted way in their favour.”By Google’s own admission, the examples it makes public only “provide a glimpse” of what it is asked to take down and are “not comprehensive”. Much of the data published by the company illustrates when it has stood firm against government requests, not when it has agreed to them. Nor does Google provide data on its decision-making framework or who regulates these decisions.US authorities have made more than 12,000 takedown requests since 2011 – with multiple items of content often included in a single request – but Google has published details of fewer than 40 of these.Google addresses the political nature of its role in its Transparency Report, stating: “Often times, government requests target political content and government criticism. Governments cite defamation, privacy and even copyright laws in their attempts to remove political speech from our services.“Our teams evaluate each request and review the content in context in order to determine whether or not content should be removed due to violation of local law or our content policies. We always assess the legitimacy and completeness of a government request.”The company added: “We share this information to shed light on the scale and scope of government requests for content removals. We hope to draw attention to the laws and legal processes around the world that affect access to information online.”Google does challenge takedown requests and has publicly fought with Russia over censorship. Last October, a Russian court fined the company $20 decillion,a “symbolic” sumthat is more than the world’s gross domestic product and equal to two undecillion roubles – a two followed by 36 zeros – for restricting Russian state media channels on YouTube. Russia has continued to make censorship requests to Google, however, and last did so in the period ending June 2024, the most recent data available.View image in fullscreenDays before Vladimir Putin, right, invaded Ukraine, Russia unsuccessfully asked Google to remove 600 domestic links related to the Chinese president Xi Jinping, left.Photograph: Sergey Guneyev/APDays before Russia invaded Ukraine, and before it declared a“no limits” partnership with China, Russia unsuccessfully sought the removal of 600 domestic links related to the Chinese president. The links included the Wikipedia pages on Xi in seven languages, as well as news articles about him in theEconomistand theNew York Times, and by broadcasters France 24 and the BBC. Google declined to remove them, however, partly because Roskomnadzor failed to provide it with enough information.Google, democracy and the truth about internet searchRead moreTomas Stamulis, chief security officer at Surfshark, which regularly tracks Google’s removals data, said it was important for the public to know about Google’s takedown process because “these requests often target political content and criticism of government actions”. “During periods of political instability or social unrest, governments, particularly authoritarian ones, may demand the removal of content they perceive as threatening or destabilising to suppress dissent,” he said.“Overall, the increase in removal requests reflects the growing importance of the internet in public life, and the challenges of managing content that crosses international and jurisdictional boundaries.”Google declined to comment.Explore more on these topicsCensorshipThe ObserverGoogleRussiaChinaHuman rightsAfghanistanTalibannewsShareReuse this content"

It is questionable how much actual political influence this gave Palmer, but he was most successful in 2013 with three Senate spots for the Palmer United Party, and one lower house seat won by Palmer himself.Following that,he spent big on an anti-Labor advertising campaign in the 2019 election, although his party didn’t win any seats or Senate spots.Then he spent big again in 2022, with theUnited Australia Party spending $123m in total in the 2021-22 financial year. Despite this, it secured just one Senate spot.Guardian Australia’s modelling shows Palmer’s United Australia Party would likely be the biggest loserunder the originally proposed donation changes. Climate 200 (operating on a vastly smaller scale than Palmer) would also have its fundraising curbed under the changes because the funding comes from a mix of a small number of large donations (which would potentially be capped) and a larger number of small donations, which wouldn’t be affected.Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailIncumbent candidates also do well under the changes, with increased public funding per vote and new administrative funds available.Reduced disclosure thresholds willalso reduce the amount of “dark money” in politics, that is, the amount of money parties receive for which no detailed source is required to be given.The changes have been criticised by the Greens and independents, who haveaccused the major political parties of a “stitch-up”.Notes on the data: TheAustralian Electoral Commission publishes political donation datain a few different data sets. Here, we’ve combined donation declarations by political parties, which are done annually by financial year, with donation declarations by political candidates, which are done for election and byelection campaign periods. This is because most party-aligned donations are declared in the annual donations, while independents declare their donations in the election declarations. This is also not showing the total money in politics in this time period – the major parties receive quite a bit more from investments, membership fees and other sources, in addition to donations."

He doesn’t want to give oxygen to a potential distraction; not with a cost-of-living election to fight in the coming months.But nor is he gagging or explicitly rebuking his Liberal colleagues who do. It is a delicate balancing act, one seemingly designed to preserve hard-won party unity without jeopardising his election hopes.Dutton has adopted a different approach on abortion rights, swiftly shutting down the debate as soon as it threatened to erupt late last year.Liberal insiders believe Dutton is right to avoid trans issues.Ghost of Deves and force of Coalition’s hard-rightBut some worry the actions of the Coalition’s hard right forces are undermining him, leaving the party exposed to a repeat of the controversy that plagued Scott Morrison’s 2022 election campaign.The party paid the price after Warringah candidateKatherine Deves’ old comments describing trans children as “surgically mutilated and sterilised” resurfaced during the campaign, damaging Liberal MPs in nearby seats under siege from teal independents.“It threw rocket fuel on the fire, energised our opponents and confirmed what people thought about us,” one Liberal source told Guardian Australia.Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailThe Deves saga followed a divisive and harmful debate over religious discrimination laws, which ended withfive LiberalMPs crossing the floor to support protections for gay and transgender students.In the postmortem to the 2022 election, the Liberal senator and prominent moderate Andrew Bragg suggested the “very regrettable”, “very undignified” and “very hurtful” episode should serve as a lesson for his party.“I don’t think people want the Liberal party to go there,”Bragg told ABC radioat the time.In the three years since, momentum for the Liberals and Nationals to go there again has built inside the parties’ grassroots membership, the backbenches of parliament and on nightly Sky News panel shows.Newsroom edition: the strategy behind Peter Dutton’s culture wars - podcastRead moreThe transgender debate has centred on two areas: the campaign to “protect” women’s sport from transgender athletes, and the case to review or ban medical treatments for children with gender dysphoria.Hanson has long agitated for inquiries into gender treatments, but last week’s motion was the first since her home state ofQueensland banned the administration of puberty blockersfor new patients while it reviews the treatment.Within days of the Queensland announcement, thefederal government taskedthe National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) with developing new guidelines for the care of children with gender dysphoria.Hanson wanted the treatments subjected to a parliamentary inquiry that would hear testimony from individuals who went through them, and parents who were “pressured, misled or denied” the right of consent.The inquiry would also consider the case for a national ban on gender-related medical interventions for under-18s, according to the proposed terms of reference.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I respect somebody’s privacy, their privacy, their sexuality, their situation, and that’s paramount to me, but again, we have to have a society which respects parental rights and the rights of children to be innocent,” he said.Referendum needed for Dutton’s call to toughen citizenship-stripping laws, expert saysRead moreThe opposition leader was also asked about trans women in sportin the wake of Trump’smove to ban them from female competitions at US schools.In response, Dutton said it was not “in the spirit of sport” for women to be denied their Olympic dream or a place on a team by someone with a “physiological advantage over them”.Dutton’s officehas never published a transcript of the 6 February interview.After it was broadcast, Butler accused Dutton and Credlin of trying to stoke a culture war over something that was “not an issue in Australia”.Coalition insiders sense community concern about transgender athletes in female sport is growing, giving Dutton cover to prosecute the issue if he wanted to.It is a different story for abortion.After debate over abortion rights raged during theQueensland state election, likely costing the LNP votes in metropolitan seats,Dutton implored his colleaguesnot to put the issue on the national agenda.Even Canavan – arguably the strongest anti-abortion voice in the Coalition – agreed it was bestavoided.Dutton doesn’t want the distraction, not with an election to win.Explore more on these topicsPeter DuttonPauline HansonAustralian politicsAustralian election 2025analysisShareReuse this content"

Secondary treatment involves finer filtration and biological processing to break down the sewage.Tertiary treatment – which is used at the Cronulla plant – involves further filtration as well as biological treatment and UV disinfectant before the effluent is released.Map of Sydney, Australia showing wastewater treatment facilitiesThe CSIRO report found that at Malabar, anywhere between zero and 79% of microplastics were removed from wastewater during the primary treatment process, while the Cronulla plant removed more than 98% of microplastics.“The Cronulla WWTP was more effective at removing microplastics from wastewater than the Malabar WWTP,” the report said.The analysis was based on samples CSIRO collected over a 24-hour period for 10 months at the Cronulla and Malabar plants.View image in fullscreenSamples from Sydney waterways are tested for microplasticsDr Scott Wilson, the research director at the Australian Microplastic Assessment Project, said it had been known “for a while” that wastewater treatment plants were the main source of microplastics pollution.“The greater the treatment process the better it is at reducing microplastics that are coming through,” he said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

New facilities would be built in Sydney stretching from Arncliffe to Quakers Hill.An EPA spokesperson said microplastics were a “major threat” to the environment and it was analysing the results from its assessment of 120 waterways across NSW including Sydney Harbour and Parramatta River.“This assessment, which was completed in mid-2024, will help us better understand what types of microplastics are out there and the scale and source of microplastics in our waterways,” they said. “A report on this work will be finalised by mid-2025.”The spokesperson said previous work such as the CSIRO report had helped inform the bans on single-use plastic items such as plastic bags and straws introduced by the NSW government.These bans had contributed to a 54% reduction in plastic litter in the environment since 2018, they said.The CSIRO declined to comment.Explore more on these topicsSydneyNew South WalesMarine lifePlasticsPollutionnewsShareReuse this content"

It said it was especially true if there was another extreme weather event in Macquarie Harbour in the next 10 years.AMCS shark expert Dr Leonardo Guida said the new report shows a “strong correlation between increased salmon farming intensity and a drop in estimated Maugean skate numbers”.“The fate of the skate literally rises and falls alongside salmon production,” he said.“The skates caught in 2024 were mostly old adults that will not be around much longer given they live to around 10-12 years, and there hasn’t been enough time to show that the uptick is solely from juveniles surviving to breeding age.“The scientists acknowledge huge uncertainty in the data from animals caught in 2023 and 2024 that shows something has happened that’s making the skates easier to catch. Without knowing exactly what happened, we’re unfortunately no longer comparing apples with apples from previous years.”Tasmanian Greens senator Nick McKim said Australia’s environmental laws were already too weak and to “water them down even further to underpin corporate profits is an outrage and a betrayal”.The director of The Australia Institute in Tasmania, Eloise Carr, said special legislation to protect farming operations in the harbour is “likely to condemn the Maugean skate to extinction should not be rushed through”.The Tasmanian premier, Jeremy Rockliff, welcomed the announcement and said he “won’t rest until salmon jobs are protected by law”.“While today is an important step, this could have been achieved long ago, and we will continue to do all we can to support our workers across all industries,” he said.The state’s Labor leader, Dean Winter, said Albanese’s letter demonstrates “an irrefutable case that salmon farming and the Maugean skate can coexist”.From the sea to your plate: how to choose more sustainable salmonRead moreMacquarie Harbour produces only about 13% of Tasmanian salmon, but industry supporters argue it is an important hub and employer on the state’s remote west coast.Prof Jayson Semmens, a co-author of the Imas report, said researchers were “cautiously optimistic” about the Maugean skate population but that “there is still a long way to go”.“Only continued monitoring of the Maugean skate population in Macquarie Harbour will allow us to know the long-term trajectory of recovery of this endangered species,” he said.Aconservation report by the government’s threatened species scientific committee last yearsaid the skate should be considered critically endangered, estimating there were between 40 and 120 adult skates remaining in the wild.The move comes after Albanese last yearvetoed a deal Plibersek had struckto support her nature positive legislation.Explore more on these topicsTasmaniaFishnewsShareReuse this content"

He is a Syrian national with legal residence in Austria, they said.The victims were all men. Two were seriously injured, according to police.A police spokesperson, Rainer Dionisio, said a motive was not immediately known. He added that police were investigating the attacker’s personal background. “We have to wait until we get secure information,” he said.A 42-year-old man who works for a food delivery company, and who is also from Syria, witnessed the incident from his car, police said. He drove toward the suspect and helped to prevent things from getting worse, Dionisio told Austria’s public broadcaster, ORF.Peter Kaiser, the governor of the Austrian province of Carinthia, expressed his condolences to the family of the 14-year-old victim.“This outrageous atrocity must be met with harsh consequences. I have always said with clarity and unambiguously: those who live in Carinthia, in Austria, have to respect the law and adjust to our rules and values.”Erwin Angerer, a lawmaker for the far-right Freedom party, said his party had been warning about the situation in Austria as a result of the country’s “disastrous asylum policy”.Austria’s interior minister, Gerhard Karner, was expected in Villach on Sunday morning.Police said it wasn’t clear whether the suspect acted on his own and continued to search for potential additional suspects.Several European countries, among them Austria, said in December they are suspending decisions on asylum claims by Syrian nationals because of the unclear political situation in their homeland following the fall of Bashar al-Assad.Agence France-Presse contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsAustriaEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

UK sources said they believed those invited to Paris by Macron would be the Nato secretary general, Mark Rutte, and the leaders of Germany, Italy, the UK and Poland.Starmer said: “This is a once-in-a-generation moment for our national security where we engage with the reality of the world today and the threat we face from Russia. It’s clear Europe must take a greater role in Nato as we work with the United States to secure Ukraine’s future and face down the threat we face from Russia. The UK will work to ensure we keep the US and Europe together. We cannot allow any divisions in the alliance to distract from the external enemies we face.”Macron’s speed in trying to unite European leaders behind a joint response shows the extent of anxiety in Europe about US efforts both to control the process and exclude European governments from any detailed negotiations between the US and Russia.1:53Zelenskyy says time has come to create an 'armed forces of Europe' – videoThe prospect of Starmer’s involvement also highlights how the UK prime minister is becoming drawn into a European response, despite the UK having left the EU. With European leaders expected to convene in Paris, it is anticipated that Russian and US officials will meet in Saudi Arabia this week to map out what they intend to be the peace process.The Europeans’ anxieties intensified on Saturday when Trump’s special envoy for Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, said it was not realistic for Europe’s leaders to be involved. “It may be like chalk on the blackboard, it may grate a little bit, but I am telling you something that is really quite honest,” said Kellogg at the Munich conference.“And to my European friends, I would say: ‘Get into the debate, not by complaining that you might, yes or no, be at the table, but by coming up with concrete proposals, ideas, ramp up [defence] spending.’”Kellogg said he was working on “Trump time”, and an agreement was expected in weeks and months.The US is also reported to have sent a letter to European states, asking what troops they are willing to supply to a peacekeeping force.One European diplomat said that “it appears Europe is going to be asked to police a deal that it had no direct hand in negotiating. In the meantime, Donald Trump is seeking to take 50% control of Ukraine’s rare minerals”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He said: “We need a guarantee that, if the agreement is violated, we can act, and this is a sufficient threat for the Russian Federation not to violate this guarantee.”He also urged the US not to disengage from Ukraine, saying the best security guarantee for the country against future Russian aggression was binding US industry, business and defence capability into its future. “That is what will make Putin sit up and pay attention, and that is what’s attractive to a US president who knows how to get a good deal.”Kellogg said one reason previous peace talks had failed was because too many countries were involved. “We are not going to get down that path,” he said on the margins of the Munich security conference.Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, had earlier used his speech to the conference to warn that Europe was likely to be excluded from the negotiations. He urged Europe to step up and form a European army in which Ukraine would play a central role.Zelenskyy told Europe to avoid being abandoned at the negotiation table by Trump. “Let’s be honest – now we can’t rule out that America might say no to Europe on issues that threaten it. Many leaders have talked about a Europe that needs its own military – an army of Europe. I believe the time has come. The armed forces of Europe must be created.“A few days ago, President Trump told me about his conversation with Putin. Not once did he mention that America needs Europe at that table. That says a lot. The old days are over – when America supported Europe just because it always had.“Ukraine will never accept deals made behind our backs without our involvement. And the same rule should apply to all of Europe. No decisions about Ukraine without Ukraine. No decisions about Europe without Europe.”With many European nations facing increasingly Eurosceptic electorates, his ideas about integration are unlikely to take off, but his remarks may galvanise the continent into more detailed discussions about what military role it can play in Ukraine, including by putting troops on the ground to protect a ceasefire.European leaders went into Saturday’s session of the Munich conference already reeling from theconfrontational speechon Friday by the US vice-president, JD Vance, in which he scolded them for ignoring popular concerns over immigration and accused them of suppressing free speech.The EU’s foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, characterised Vance as “trying to pick a fight” with Europe, home to some of the US’s closest allies.The Polish prime minister, Donald Tusk, responded on social media, saying: “Europe urgently needs its own plan of action concerning Ukraine and our security, or else other global players will decide about our future. Not necessarily in line with our own interest … This plan must be prepared now. There’s no time to lose.”Explore more on these topicsUkraineThe ObserverEuropeUS foreign policyRussianewsShareReuse this content"

Only half of those on board had life jackets. The French navy’s Dauphin helicopter was also involved in the rescue operation.Two people were carried unconscious on to the Abeille Normandie. One was resuscitated while the other was taken by helicopter to hospital, where they were later pronounced dead.The person is at least the fourth so far this year to die attempting to cross the Channel in a small boat.A Syrian man in his twenties is thought to have been crushed to deathon 11 January in an overcrowded boat that began to collapse after setting off from Sangatte. On 10 February two bodies were found after attempting to swim out to a small boat.So far this year more than 1,500 people have crossed the Channel in small boats including three people who made their own boat and crossed the Channel on 10 February. The UK government haslaunched initiativesthey say will“smash” the business modelof the smugglers who organise the Channel crossings.Last year 36,816 people crossed the Channel, down fromthe record high in 2022, when 45,755 crossed. Since small boat crossings began in 2018, more than 150,000 people have arrived in the UK by this route.A statement from the French maritime prefecture for the Channel and the North Sea said the Channel was particularly dangerous in the middle of winter for precarious and overloaded boats, as it was a busy shipping lane with difficult weather conditions.Utopia 56, a French organisation that supports migrants in northern Franceposted on X about Saturday’s death, describing it as a “harmful consequence” of government policies to stop small boats from crossing the Channel.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

For Carras, who founded the heritage society 50 years ago with her late Anglo-Greek shipowner husband, Costas, it’s a battle redolent of older struggles. More than four decades after the “neighbourhood of the gods” survived being overrun by nightclubs and terrace bars, its discovery by developers, avaricious investors and global real estate firms, is again posing an existential threat. On the back of the tourist boom, entire buildings had fallen prey to the short-term rental industry and Airbnb. The few shops that have held out are, like residents, on the brink of extinction.“Plaka is meant to be protected as it’s so unique,” says Carras. “Thanks to special zoning laws enshrined in presidential decrees it was saved all those years ago. The reality now is that residents are leaving and not only because laws are being violated; the crowds, the noise, the chaos have made their lives unbearable.”Visitors, she said, did not want to experience “lifeless stage sets” but inhabited areas that felt authentic and real. “This is a small neighbourhood. It was built for residents, not what we’re seeing today.”View image in fullscreenRestaurateurs enjoy a brief respite from the crowds in the Plaka district of central Athens.Photograph: Louisa Gouliamaki/AFP/Getty ImagesIn his cavernous city hall office Doukas does not disguise his consternation. The projections of tourist arrivals are nothing short of pleasing – further proof that Athens is no longer a pit stop for travellers en route to the islands. But at record highs the forecasts are also replete with risk.This year, 10 million visitors, two million more than in 2024, are predicted to descend on the capital, many for city breaks that have made it so popular. If only a fraction head towards Plaka, there will be “intolerable pressure” on its labyrinthine network of alleys and streets.“Of the 35 million tourists Greece is set to receive, 10 million, nearly equal to Greece’s entire population, will visit Athens,” he says. “For the first time we’ll be Greece’s top destination, but it’s unsustainable. Plaka, in particular, is oversaturated. It can’t go on.”A recent “carrying capacity” study commissioned by the municipality and drafted by the university of Piraeus, urged authorities to take immediate action if Athens wanted to avoid becoming a victim of its own success.“There’s not a day to lose. We have to act if we don’t want to become the next Barcelona, which is why the task force, with the support of the municipal police, will have every service at its disposal,” explained Doukas, a professor of energy policy before the centre-left Pasok party fielded him for the post.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It’s already happened several times with short-term rentals.”Few neighbourhoods inEuropehave been lived in as continuously as Plaka. Nestled on the northern and eastern slopes of the Acropolis, its mansions and two-storey buildings, wrapped around the Agora and other archaeological sites, it is an area that has been inhabited since neolithic times. For Greeks the quarter is not just a window on the classical world but an unbreakable link with antiquity.“When inhabitants leave, places die,” says Giorgos Zafeiriou, an architect who heads Plaka’s residents association. “We’ve seen it time and again.”The situation had become “desperate” for the district’s diminishing community, long forced into a fragile coexistence with the owners of cafes, restaurants and bars. In summer the influx put extraordinary pressure on Plaka’s antiquated infrastructure, he said, especially its sewage system. Worries about overtourism were such that residents joined the network of Mediterranean Historical Cities to exchange experiences on how to deal with the issues.“What we’re seeing,” says Zafeiriou, “is a fight for the soul of Plaka. But there’s cause for optimism, too.”One ray of hope is an upcoming, potentially landmark ruling from the Council of State, Greece’s highest administrative court, on the legality of 16 buildings being converted into Airbnb units in Plaka, given its protected residential status. Brought by Ellet, the action will be pivotal in determining whether land use regulations, enforced to preserve the neighbourhood’s character, have been contravened. If the judges rule in favour a precedent will be set.“The two presidential degrees establishing Plaka’s particular urban planning rules were specific. Hotels could exist but only in selected spots,” notes Dimitris Melissas, a professor of law representing Ellet at the 5 March hearing. “Here we have buildings acting as clandestine hotels, offering accommodation and breakfast and meals on terraces, where commercial activity is also strictly banned. That we argue is unconstitutional.”An epidemic of falls on the ‘mean streets’ of AthensRead moreWith soaring rents fuelling an incipient housing crisis, the centre-right government recently banned new, short-term rental registrations on online platforms in central Athens.Passed in January the legislation has raised hopes that hedge funds and developers, who moved in a decade ago, snapping up property at rock bottom prices during Greece’s debt crisis, will also begin to move on.“Foreign investors see Athens as some kind of El Dorado. They’re reaping the profits, not Greeks,” says Doukas, warning many could end up with stranded assets if they continue to defy the decrees protecting Plaka. “First, they attempted to get around the ban on hotels in the neighbourhood through Airbnb and now they’re trying to get around the ban on Airbnb by advertising properties as ‘serviced apartments’, thanks to an oversight in the new law that clearly needs to be amended.”The message, he says, is simple. Investors should “forget it” if they want to invest in short-term rentals in the neighbourhood of the gods.“Go elsewhere! Plaka is our connection with antiquity. It’s integral to the strength of Athens. We’re not going to allow it to become some tourist luna park, an endless shopping mall, denuded of residents and destroyed.”Explore more on these topicsOvertourismThe ObserverGreeceEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

The gaunt appearance of the last group of released captives shocked and angered the Israeli public, andraised fears about the wellbeing of the remaining hostages.Of the Palestinian prisoners released on Saturday, 333 had been captured or arrested in Gaza since the beginning of the war. They were taken straight to the territory. Thirty-six Palestinians serving life sentences in Israeli jails were also released. About two dozen were immediately deported through Egypt to other Arab countries. One was taken to Jerusalem and 10 arrived by bus in Ramallah, the main city in theWest Bankand administrative centre of the Palestinian Authority, where a crowd had gathered to welcome them.1:33Tears and joy as released Palestinian prisoners and detainees reunite with families – videoThe prisoners, who were transferred to private cars and taken home, had all spent more than 20 years in Israeli prisons, according to Abdullah al-Zaghari, the chair of the Palestinian Prisoners Society.Most of those released on Saturday had been part of the military wing of Fatah, the dominant faction of the Palestinian Liberation Organisation, and had taken part in violent uprisings against Israeli occupation.“To feel free is indescribable,” said, Ameer Abu Ra’adaha, who spent 32 of his 51 years in jail. He said the prisoners knew there would be an exchange a few days before as the guards conducted raids on the cells and beat some of the inmates.Abu Ra’adaha said he only found he would be among those released at 6.30am on Saturday. He was told by prison guards who presented the departing prisoners with a T shirt expressing their reluctance to let them go.The T-shirts, produced on the orders of the head of the prison service, were printed with the words: “We will never forget and we will never forgive.”Abu Ra’adaha was hailed a hero at a community centre in al-Amariri camp in Ramallah, dressed in a black cap and green jacket with a Palestinian keffiyah around his shoulders. Men queued to embrace him, while the hall filled with teenagers and young boys who had come to catch a glimpse of the emaciated veteran, who looked stunned and exhausted.“I just want to get married, build a house and live my life,” Abu Ra’adaha said.Saturday’s exchange marks the latest scheduled step in the first phase of the Gaza ceasefire agreement, which came into effect on 19 January. However, the future of the agreement is still uncertain: under the terms of the 42-day first phase of the ceasefire brokered by Qatar, Egypt and the US, negotiations for a second phase had been due to start on 3 February.‘Time is running out’: frailty of freed hostages raises pressure on NetanyahuRead moreThe Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, sent negotiators to Doha days later, but the delegation was not mandated to discuss phase two, which is meant to lay out steps towards ending the war.The US secretary of state,Marco Rubio, whose country is Israel’s top backer and one of the truce mediators, is due to arrive in Israel late on Saturday to discuss the truce’s future and Trump’s depopulation plan with Israeli officials.Arab leaders have flatly rejected Trump’s proposal, which international law experts say amounts to ethnic cleansing.Saudi Arabia is hosting delegations from Egypt, Jordan, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates on Thursday for a summit on the issue, and the Arab League will convene to discuss alternatives on 27 February.Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warGazaHamasIsraelWest BankPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

They don’t have any open injury. Most [likely died from] hypoxia or maybe some blunt injury but that would only be confirmed after an autopsy.“There are also 11 others who are injured. Most of them are stable and have orthopaedic injuries.”Narendra Modi, the Indian prime minister, said on X: “My thoughts are with all those who have lost their loved ones. I pray that the injured have a speedy recovery. The authorities are assisting all those who have been affected by this stampede.”Authorities ordered an inquiry into the incident and said the situation was now under control.The defence minister, Rajnath Singh, said he was “extremely pained by the loss of lives due to stampede” at the New Delhi railway station.“In this hour of grief, my thoughts are with the bereaved families. Praying for the speedy [recovery] of the injured,” Singh said in a social media post.The governor of the capital, Vinai Kumar Saxena, said disaster management personnel had been told to deploy and “all hospitals are in readiness to address related exigencies”.The railways minister, Ashwini Vaishnaw, said additional special trains were being run from New Delhi to clear the rush of devotees.The six-weekKumbh Melais the single biggest milestone in the Hindu religious calendar, and officials said about 500 million devotees have already visited the festival since it began last month.More than 400 people died after they were trampled or drowned on a single day of the festival in 1954, one of the largest tolls in a crowd-related disaster globally.Another 36 people were crushed to death in 2013, the last time the festival was staged in Prayagraj.Explore more on these topicsIndiaKumbh MelaHinduismReligionSouth and central AsianewsShareReuse this content"

The suspect was a man who knew the victim, police said.The suspect may have entered the water at the Dartford Crossing, police said, after call handlers received reports of a man on the wrong side of the barrier.The senior investigating officer, DCI David Higham, said they are “not ruling out the possibility that he may have entered the water”, and that the force is “currently only looking for one suspect and do not believe there to be an ongoing risk to the public”.Map of area where murder occurredOfficers were called to the pub near Sevenoaks just after 7pm on Friday. The force said in a statement: “Officers attended the scene along with South East Coast ambulance service where a woman in her 40s had suffered injuries consistent with gunshot wounds.“She was declared deceased at the scene and a murder investigation is under way. Her next of kin has been informed.“As part of inquiries, officers attended the Dartford Crossing where a vehicle linked to the incident was recovered, alongside a firearm. Inquiries are ongoing to identify and locate all persons potentially involved.”Ray Picot, a local parish councillor, told Kent Online he had heard “a couple of loud bangs” at 7pm. “It’s a shock. We’ve never had anything like this,” he said. “It’s a very busy pub, a great pub. It never has any trouble and is very well-managed.“I understand those inside the pub were ushered back to their houses by police as they were all in terrible shock. It sounded awful.”Fellow parish councillor Steve Maines told the BBC: “We were sitting having our Valentine’s Day meal when all of a sudden we heard this huge commotion outside in the car park. We were told someone had been shot so we had to leave.”Dorothy Wong, who lives in the village, said: “I heard around three to four bangs outside and loud shouting from a woman’s voice.”It is understood neither the suspect or victim were from Kent but had local connections to the area.PA Media contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsKentEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

Others have been concerned about the level of support for her from colleagues during the exchanges.While most MPs are sympathetic to Badenoch, who isless than four months into the job, some MPs and frontbenchers want to see her bolster her advisory team with Tory figures seasoned in the difficult task of landing political blows.One former cabinet minister said there had been complaints among MPs that Badenoch kept avoiding obvious attacks on Starmer’s handling of the economy, instead opting for “Westminster village-orientated” topics that she persevered with for too long. “People are putting on a brave face at the moment, but the comment I’ve heard more often than any other is that she keeps picking the wrong subjects,” they said. “There are some big things going on that could really resonate – like the economy.”An MP who shared the concerns said: “We have people who have been involved in PMQs prep for a long time and I hope she’s got some continuity there, because it’s important we get it right. It doesn’t necessarily mean she’ll be perfect, but she needs experience behind her. You need wise heads who know what they’re doing.”The discontent surfaced after this week’s outing, in whichBadenoch confronted Starmerover an attempt by a family from Gaza to use a Ukrainian resettlement scheme to come to the UK, as well as the appointment of a new borders inspector who lives in Finland.However, Starmer responded by stating that the government was already reviewing the findings of the case of the Gazan family, while the borders inspector had been appointed by the last government – and had now been instructed to work from the UK.Sympathetic Tory MPs said that the complaints over Badenoch’s approach were simply evidence of how hard it was to make an impression as opposition leader and pleaded for colleagues to give her time. “No one’s going to be a rock star immediately,” said one frontbencher. “It’s going to be incredibly difficult and she’s got to grow into the job. If it does seem clunky, she’s got four years to get this right. Having said that, Starmer is unbelievably crap.”Close allies of Badenoch reject the criticisms of her approach to PMQs. They argue that with Labour enjoying a “super majority” in the Commons, she is showing she is serious about holding the government to account. They also say that her attacks on Starmer for not being on top of what his government is doing will expose the prime minister.“Whatever the commentariat’s view, Kemi is holding Starmer to account,” one said. “This week, he misled the House of Commons [overthe Gaza family’s case]. He said this court case was heard under the last government. It was not. He also refused to say whether this government would appeal the verdict. There have been previous examples. Her job is to be an effective opposition and that is what she is determined to do every week. She’s not going to be sidetracked or worried about what people are saying.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

MPs said any discussion about replacing another leader would make them look absurd and must be avoided. Many Tories believe thatRobert Jenrick, the shadow justice secretary who Badenoch defeated to become leader, continues to have leadership ambitions and is waiting in the wings.“We’ve got the leader we’ve got,” said an MP. “People saying she’s got until after the local elections to prove herself are nuts.

The bind she finds herself in is more the stuff of a chancellor’s nightmares than dreams.Things, broadly speaking, have not gone to plan for Reeves since the end of October, at home or abroad.Growth has stalled – the Bank of England said earlier this month that it hadreduced its growth forecastfrom the 1.5% it was expecting in November to 0.75% – and borrowing costs have risen.This has meant less money in to the exchequer in taxation and more heading out of it to finance the government’s huge mountain of debt.In this double-negative scenario, bond markets have suffered bouts of jitters (though not quite Liz Truss style) putting everyone including the Treasury on edge.The£9.9bn of headroom, or spare money, which Reeves had left in the system to keep within her own “iron-clad” fiscal rules (which say she must pay for day-to-day expenses out of taxation) will in all probability have disappeared when the Office for Budget Responsibility reports ahead of her spring statement at the end of next month and lowers its forecasts again. Something has to give and soon.Government ministers roll their eyes in desperation when asked what Reeves can do. Global threats – Donald Trump’s tariffs and the effects they will have on America’s trading partners including Britain, together with demands for European countries to massively increase their defence spending, have added a sense that whatever strategy is adopted could be blown out of the water by international events.Labour MPs know there are three short-term options for Reeves. But they also know that all of them would be hugely damaging politically.View image in fullscreenDonald Trump’s trade tariffs are likely to hurt Britain’s economy.Photograph: Adam Vaughan/EPAOne is to raise taxes again at the spring budget. The second is to cut spending by more than planned already in real terms towards the end of this parliament. And the third is to break the “iron-clad” rules, and be damned.Rob Wood, chief UK economist at consultants Pantheon Macroeconomics says that while there are now some positive messages from the economy, the chancellor is almost certain to be told by the OBR in the coming weeks that all her financial leeway has indeed evaporated and that therefore she will need to cut spending or raise taxes.Not to act could be disastrous. “If the chancellor declines to take any action next month should her headroom be gone, there will be an adverse market reaction,” he said.James Smith, research director at the Resolution Foundation, agreed: “With the Treasury confirming that the fiscal rules are non-negotiable, this throws up unenviable policy choices for the chancellor – putting in place unpopular tax rises or painful cuts to public services or welfare. Failing to do this would risk a loss of confidence in financial markets.”But Reeves’s difficulties are compounded by the fact that she has explicitly, during and since the budget, ruled out going down any of the three main routes available to her.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionOn tax she has boxed herself into a very tight corner. Many economists now believe her best option on raising tax would be to extend the Tories’ freeze on tax thresholds beyond 2028, thereby reversing a pledge she made in the budget to end the freeze then. A move to extend the freeze, the Institute for Fiscal Studies says, would bring in £3.5bn to £4bn if national insurance thresholds were also frozen.But during her October budget Reeves said that extending the freeze would “hurt working people”. She added: “When it comes to choices on tax, this government chooses to protect working people every single time.” Shortly after delivering the budget she also told businesspeople that the Labour government wouldnot be “coming back for more”in tax.As for spending cuts, the pledges from Reeves and Keir Starmer not to return the country to austerity have become a mantra. More departmental spending cuts on the NHS, schools, courts or transport and sub-inflation pay rises for public sector workers would look like breaches of promises.As for breaking her fiscal rules it is, says one senior economist, the most unthinkable of all. “It would set the markets off like that. She won’t allow that to happen.”All she can do, says Ben Zaranko at the Institute for Fiscal Studies is to pray for growth. But even that looks like it would be too late.“The best way out of this fiscal bind is, of course, economic growth,” he said. “Here, the recent data is mixed. The government has announced a raft of proposals and policies aimed at boosting growth, many of which are commendably focused on the longer term.“But that’s just the problem for Reeves – an infrastructure building boom would likely deliver considerable economic benefits to the UK in future, but those growth benefits won’t arrive in time to ease the fiscal constraints she faces in the short term.”Explore more on these topicsEconomic policyThe ObserverRachel ReevesEconomic growth (GDP)EconomicsBudget deficitanalysisShareReuse this content"

Britain exports about 209,000 tonnes of steel to the US every year and imports about 16,000, making it the second-biggest export market after the EU.“It is in neither of our interests to have these tariffs,” said Reynolds, who said he remains optimistic that talks with US officials could lead to a resolution before serious damage is done.The director general of industry body UK Steel, Gareth Stace, said last week that the US action wouldstifle UK exportsand damage Britain’s balance of trade at a time when global protectionism was on the rise.“The US is our second-largest export market after the EU, and this move threatens more than £400m of steel exports [each year],” Stace said.View image in fullscreenA £500m investment has been set aside the fund new steel production at Port Talbot in south Wales.Photograph: Andrew Ray/AlamyIn its election manifesto, the then Labour opposition announced plans to spend £2.5bn in order to “rebuild the UK steel industry”. The money would sit alongside aseparate £500m packagefor Tata Steel to part-fund new steel production at Port Talbot in south Wales.Now ministers intend to turbocharge decisions on how that money can best be used to strengthen the steel industry, with the emphasis being on government co-financing of innovative projects led by the private sector. Part of the aim is to ensure that a severely weakened UK steel industry is healthy enough to act as primary supplier in key infrastructure projects in this country that lie at the heart of the government’s drive for growth.Last week, Heathrow delivered welcome news to British Steel, and the industry nationwide, bypledging to use UK-made steelin its largest-ever investment programme, and indicated it would also do so if and when the controversial proposal for a third runway gets the official go-ahead.Heathrow’s plans that would use UK steel include the main new terminal’s infrastructure, with investment in the capacity of Terminal 2 and Terminal 5.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Most people regain their sense of smell as their infection fades, but some never recover. It means not being able to tell if milk is off, if there’s a gas leak or what your newborn baby smells like.But for victims of anosmia and its crueller sibling, parosmia, where ordinary smells are transformed into the stench ofrotting flesh or sewage, there is new hope. Researchers have discovered that a simple procedure can help people recover their sense of smell years after losing it to viral infections such as Covid, or even decades later.The first patient in the UK began receiving treatment this month and doctors hope the process could be easily rolled out across the NHS.Chrissi Kelly is the first patient in the UK to receive the treatment, which consists of injections of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) from her own blood,prepared by using a centrifuge to separate the platelets from red and white blood cells.“It’s amazing to be able to say ‘there’s a treatment’, because for years that was just off the table,” Kelly said. “And it’s thrilling to be asked to be the first one to receive it.”View image in fullscreenResearch has suggested the sense of smell can be regained by inhaling coffee.Photograph: Viktor Fischer/AlamyKelly lost her sense of smell after developing sinusitis in 2012, and describes anosmia as “like a bereavement”. After three months she began to hallucinate smells, a condition known as phantosmia, then developed parosmia.The only help she could find was research that suggested she could retrain her sense by inhaling known smells such as coffee and lavender. The condition was so little known that Kelly decided to set up a charity,AbScent, to offer support to other sufferers and make other smell-training kits.The Covid pandemic changed everything, with millions of people around the world losing their sense of smell, including Katherine Ryan, the comedian, who said the disorder made her feel “helpless”. AbScent went from 1,500 members in its support group to 95,000 at the same time as its income from the smell-training kits disappeared when cheaper competitors emerged. She closed the charity last year.View image in fullscreenChrissi Kelly at home in London after receiving the first stage of her PRP (platelet-rich plasma) treatment to cure her loss of smell following a virus in 2012.Photograph: Antonio Olmos/The ObserverBut the pandemic also sparked a new wave of research. Prof Zara Patel, director of endoscopic skull base surgery at Stanford University, had been examining anosmia for some time and spotted a neurology paper that suggested PRP might help regenerate nerves.This is important because of the reason Covid affects smell – the SARS-CoV-2 virus binds to cells around the olfactory nerve at the top of the nose.“The way that the olfactory system and olfactory nerve works is unique in all the other cranial nerves,” Patel told theObserver. “None of the other cranial nerves have the ability to regenerate, but the olfactory nerve does.”So if PRP could help the olfactory nerve regenerate, it might relieve anosmia. Patel set up a series of randomised control trials – easier to recruit after Covid – and found that PRP worked better than a placebo after three months and the effect was greater after 12 months. In one case, a 73-year-old man recovered his smell45 yearsafter losing it.Patel’s work impressed Prof Claire Hopkins, a former president of the British Rhinological Society and professor of rhinology at King’s College London who practises at Guy’s hospital in London. She was one of the first people to identify a link between Covid and anosmia and had been investigating other treatments such as steroids.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The risks are small, so I think it is something I can now offer. I will look to try to set this up within the NHS. PRP is used within the NHS for other things, so I’m hopeful we will be able to offer it.”Because PRP is made with centrifuges that are already being used in hospitals, and uses a patient’s own blood, there are fewer regulatory hurdles than other medical procedures. Hopkins and other ear, nose and throat teams need to get approval for the procedure from their hospital boards.Kelly needs to have two further PRP injections over the next three months to complete the treatment. She is cautious about whether she can already sense any effects.“I’m probably the most acute observer of my own sense of smell,” she said, referring to her years of smell training. “I still can’t eat onions. I’m great with coffee, but there are other things like roasted meat I really don’t enjoy as much as I used to.“When I step out of the house in the morning, I will recognise that I’m getting some kind of feedback on what the time of year is and that sort of thing. It’s not always easy for me to say I smell something specific, but I’m always aware of that.“And the other day, I stepped out of my house, and I’m thinking to myself, ‘Oh gosh, that smells good.’ And before I turned around, I thought to myself, ‘That smells like winter-flowering jasmine.’ And it was.”Explore more on these topicsMedical researchThe ObserverLong CovidCoronavirusInfectious diseasesHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

Vance said he had been charged with the “heinous crime of standing 50 metres from an abortion clinic and silently praying for three minutes, not obstructing anyone, not interacting with anyone, just silently praying on his own”.Smith-Connor, who is receivinglegal support from Alliance Defending Freedom International, a conservative Christian legal advocacy group in the US, was convicted of breaching a safe zone in October last year after refusing repeated requests to move away from outside an abortion clinic in Bournemouth in November 2022.A community officer spoke to him for an hour and 40 minutes and asked him to leave, but he refused. Smith-Connor was handed a two-year conditional discharge and ordered to pay more than £9,000 costs after the case brought by Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole council.Vance also claimed the Scottish government had distributed letters to citizens whose houses lay “within so-called safe access zones, warning them that even private prayer within their own homes may amount to breaking the law”. Shortly after his statement, a Scottish government spokesperson said: “The vice-president’s claim is incorrect. Private prayer at home is not prohibited within safe access zones and no letter has ever suggested it was.”TheAbortion Services (Safe Access Zones) (Scotland) Act, introduced last year, banned “silent prayer” to prevent mass silent vigils that have been used by large groups of US pro-life protesterssuch as 40 Days for Life. The law states that the actions are only banned if they are likely to cause alarm or distress to someone accessing abortion services.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Two other judges were fired under similar circumstances in the last week.It was unclear whether they would be replaced. The US Department of Justice’s executive office for immigration review, which runs the courts and oversees its roughly 700 judges, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Saturday.Immigration courts are backlogged with more than 3.7m cases, according to Syracuse University’s Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, and it takes years to decide asylum cases. There is support across the political spectrum for more judges and support staff, though the first Trump administration also put pressure on some judges to decide cases more quickly.The Trump administration earlier replaced five top court officials, including Mary Cheng, the Executive Office for Immigration Review’s acting director. Sirce Owen, the current leader and previously an appellate immigration judge, has issued a slew of new instructions, many reversing policies of the Biden administration.Send us a tipIf you have information you’d like to share securely with the Guardian about the impact of cuts to federal programs, please use a non-work device to contact us via the Signal messaging app at (646) 886-8761.Last month, the justice department halted financial support for non-governmental organizations to provide information and guidance to people facing deportation but restored funding after a coalition of non-profit groups filed a federal lawsuit.The firings touch on two top Trump priorities: mass deportations and shrinking the size of the federal government. On Thursday, it ordered agencies to lay off nearly all probationary employees who had not yet gained civil service protection, potentially affecting hundreds of thousands of workers. Probationary workers generally have less than a year on the job.Biggs, the union official, said he didn’t know whether the judges’ firings were intended to send a message on immigration policy and characterized them as part of a campaign across the federal workforce.“They’re treating these people as if they’re not human beings,” he said. “It’s bad all around.”Explore more on these topicsUS immigrationTrump administrationDonald TrumpUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

It currently employs more than 65,000federal and contract employees nationwide. The US is projected to spend approximately $756bn on nuclear forces between 2023 and 2032, according to acongressional budget office report.Last year, the Biden administration approved a US nuclear strategy to prepare for possible coordinated nuclear confrontations with Russia, China and North Korea. Two years earlier, the same administration amended the longstanding “no first use” policy.The 2022 US nuclear posture review said the US nuclear arsenal “is intended to complicate an adversary’s entire decision calculus, including whether to instigate a crisis, initiate armed conflict, conduct strategic attacks using non-nuclear capabilities, or escalate to the use of nuclear weapons on any scale”.Last week, Trump said he wants all countries to move toward denuclearization once “we straighten it all out” in the Middle East and Ukraine.“There’s no reason for us to be building brand-new nuclear weapons. We already have so many,” Trump said on Thursday at the White House. “You could destroy the world 50 times over, 100 times over. And here we are building new nuclear weapons, and they’re building nuclear weapons.”“We’re all spending a lot of money that we could be spending on other things that are actually, hopefully, much more productive,” he said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The administration rescinded the order two days later and is re-evaluating it.Across the federal government, about 280,000 employees out of the 2.3 million-member civilian federal workforce were hired in the last two years, with most still on probation and easier to fire, according to government data.In addition to the visits to national parks, about 159 million people visit national forests annually. The Department of Agriculture, which oversees the Forest Service, said it could not comment on personnel matters.The agriculture department said in a statement that protecting people and communities, as well as infrastructure, businesses and resources, remains “a top priority”.“Our wildland firefighter and other public safety positions are of the utmost priority,” it added.However, the federal funding freeze is affecting programs meant to mitigate wildfire risk in western states as well as freezing the hiring of seasonal firefighters.The reduction in resources for wildfire prevention comes a month after devastating blazes in Los Angeles that are expected to be the costliest in US history.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But in November, Missouri residents voted to pass a ballot measure adding abortion rights to the state constitution.The ACLU of Missouri, Planned Parenthood Great Plains and Planned Parenthood Great Rivers then sued Missouri to strike down a bevy of anti-abortion laws.The Jackson county circuit court judge Jerri Zhang agreed to halt a number of those laws in December. But Zhang left in place a requirement that abortion clinics be licensed by the Missouri department of health and senior services – a policy that Planned Parenthood said in court papers was “medically unnecessary”.While that requirement was in place, the reproductive healthcare giant said its clinics could not perform abortions in Missouri.“It was so weaponized when we had to get licensure from the state. The state would delay,” Emily Wales, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Great Plains,told the Guardian in December. “They would force us to litigate to get a license.”Planned Parenthood asked Zhang to reconsider the ruling. In her Friday order, Zhang declared that the licensing requirement was “discriminatory”.“It does not treat services provided in abortion facilities the same as other types of similarly situated healthcare, including miscarriage care,” Zhang wrote.The Missouri attorney general is likely to appeal Zhang’s ruling.Explore more on these topicsMissouriAbortionReproductive rightsWomen's healthnewsShareReuse this content"

In New York, Mangione is charged with three counts of murder as well as allegations that he killed Thompson “in furtherance of terrorism”, a charge that carries a maximum sentence of life in prison.Federal prosecutors separately charged Mangione in the killing with a four-count indictment that could bring thedeath penalty if he is convicted.Mangione was arrested in Pennsylvania days after Thompson’s slaying and transferred back to New York. He has pleaded not guilty to all charges against him.Mangione’s comments on the website are the first he has made since he yelled to reporters that coverage of the event had been “an insult to the intelligence of the American people and their lived experience”.The suspect, who is being held at Brooklyn’s Metropolitan Detention Center while awaiting trial, has been fighting the charges as much in the court of public opinion as in the courtroom. Amid the public, many have come to see him as a handsome vigilante.Pennsylvania’s governor, Josh Shapiro, has sharply criticized people who have suggested Mangione is a hero or justified in allegedly killing Thompson, whose survivors include his widow and their two high school-aged children.Shapiro said some reactions have been “deeply disturbing as some have looked to celebrate instead of condemning this killer”.“In a civil society, we are all less safe when ideologues engage in vigilante justice,” Shapiro said. “In some dark corners, this killer is being hailed as a hero. Hear me on this: he is no hero.”Apollpublished in late December by the National Opinion Research Center at the University of Chicago concluded that most Americans believe the national health insurance industry’s profits – aided greatly by routine denials of coverage – shared some responsibility for Thompson’s slaying. But the survey found about 80% of Americans believed Thompson’s killer had either “a great deal” or “a moderate amount” of responsibility for the murder.Nonetheless, people who are sympathetic to Mangione had raised more than $425,000 for his legal defense as of Saturday. His legal team has said it intends to accept those donations, which are being raised on theGiveSendGo platform.Explore more on these topicsBrian Thompson shootingGun crimeUS crimeHealth insuranceUS healthcarenewsShareReuse this content"

Some of the members have worked at the tech giant Google, and many have advocated for veganism and identify as transgender.Along the way, the group is believed to have bought a tugboat in Alaska under a plan to live on it to avoid high rents in northernCalifornia. The tugboat, part of the group’s “Rationalist Fleet”, now sits half-submerged near Pillar Point Harbor near San Jose.Much of what is known about the Zizians’ philosophy is gleaned from online postings in which LaSota wondered what would happen to society if it were stripped of morality through “evil people ganging up to kill off good people” or if the group’s goals “ultimately required sociopathy”.In one instance,according to an article in SFGatepublished earlier in February, LaSota faked her death. An obituary posted online mentioned a boating accident and spoke of LaSota “loving adventure, friends and family, music, blueberries, biking, computer games and animals”.But an analysis of interviews and online postings published by the Associated Press on Friday revealed how the group of young computer scientists appeared to have become increasingly violent.Maland, 44, was killed in a 20 January shootout following a traffic stop in Coventry,Vermont, a small town about 20 miles (32km) from the Canadian border. Washington state resident Teresa Youngblut, 21, faces two weapons charges in connection with the killing.She was traveling with German citizenOphelia Bauckholt. Both had connections to LaSota. The pair had been under the surveillance of authorities for several days after an employee at a hotel where they were staying reported seeing Youngblut carrying a gun.According to SFGate, they wore all black, carried weapons openly and wrapped their phones in aluminium foil. Investigators also said a night vision device and laptops were found in their Toyota Prius. Court records note that Youngblut’s diary contains several references to taking LSD.Bauckholt, 26, died in the Vermont shootout. Authorities have not specified whose bullets hit whom. Youngblut’s lawyer said through a spokesperson that they are not commenting. Youngblut pleaded not guilty in federal court on 7 February.In November 2019, LaSota; Emma Borhanian, 31; Gwen Danielson; and Alexander Leatham, 29, were arrested at a protest outside a northern California retreat center where a rationalist group was holding an event. The group said they were protesting sexual misconduct inside the group.In 2022, landlord Curtis Lind went to court to evict Borhanian, LaSota, Leatham and other tenants who had stopped paying rent at a Vallejo, California, property. Two days before the 15 November eviction deadline, prosecutors say, Leatham, Borhanian and Suri Dao attacked him.Lind shot his attackers, killing Borhanian and wounding Leatham. He survived being impaled with a sword but lost an eye. Prosecutors concluded he had acted in self-defense and charged Dao and Leatham with violent crimes.On 17 January, the 82-year-old landlord was stabbed to death. Maximilian Snyder, 22,an Oxford-educated data scientist, who had applied for a marriage license with Teresa Youngblut in Washington state in November, is charged with murder in that case.On New Year’s Eve 2022, Rita and Richard Zajko were shot and killed in Chester Heights,Pennsylvania.Police questioned the couple’s daughter, Michelle, at her home in Vermont, and a few weeks later, took her into custody at a Pennsylvania hotel. She was not arrested or charged. LaSota was at the hotel, too. She was arrested after refusing to cooperate with officers and charged with obstructing law enforcement and disorderly conduct.Six months later, LaSota was released on bail but stopped showing up for court. LaSota’s attorney, Daniel McGarrigle, said last month his client was “wholly and unequivocally innocent of the charges filed in this case”. She has missed court appearances in two states, and bench warrants have been issued for her arrest.Authorities attempting to piece together the pieces of the Zizian puzzle have acknowledged the potential connections between the Vermont shooting and previous incidents.“Teresa Youngblut is believed to have associations with other individuals suspected of violent acts in multiple states, to include Pennsylvania and California,” Sarah Ruane, a spokesperson for the FBI in Albany, New York,told USA Today.“The FBI is coordinating information sharing on any case-related details with our partners from various law enforcement agencies to effectively follow every lead and aggressively investigate these connections,” Ruane added.Explore more on these topicsUS crimeVermontPennsylvaniaCaliforniaGun crimeWest CoastnewsShareReuse this content"

Preparing dinner for their two young sons, she texted him to ask when he was coming home.“When are you coming home? I’m going to make dinner,” she recalls asking. “I wrote you a letter via email that you need to read,” he replied.“My heart just sank,” D’Alessandro, 32, said in an interview. “I knew something was wrong.”In the letter, she says he admitted to struggling with a secret and debilitatinggamblingaddiction, and that he had spent all their money on DraftKings Sportsbook.How the quick high of ‘fast-food gambling’ ensnared young menRead moreA shocked D’Alessandro rushed to the bank, where she found their accounts – including those holding the proceeds of her 2021 home sale, and money given to their children when they were baptized – drained and overdrafted, she said.It all suddenly clicked, she said. She had recently struggled to log into their bank accounts, which were mostly joint and managed by her husband. The passwords were no longer working.“I realized that he was the one that went in and changed all of the passwords,” she said.D’Alessandro filed for divorce the next day. Her husband never returned to her grandparents’ home, where they had been temporarily staying after selling her house in 2021, she says.In December she filed a lawsuit against DraftKings and itsNew Jerseycasino partners, onbehalf of herself and their two children,accusing the company of “actively” participating in her husband’s addiction “by targeting him with incentives, bonuses, and other gifts to create, nurture, expedite, and/or exacerbate his addiction”.Once the VIP has their hooks in them it then goes to those astronomical levels.Matthew Litt, attorneyIn 2022 and 2023, according to the complaint, DraftKings assigned D’Alessandro’s husband to a “VIP group”, where so-called “VIP hosts” engage high-spending customers and offer perks, credits and gifts to reward them – andencourage continued gambling.The lawsuit claims between January 2020 and January 2024 her husband – identified in the lawsuit only by his username “Mdallo1990” – deposited and lost increasing amounts of money on the sports betting app, including nearly $1m she claims belonged to her and their two children.By 2022, he deposited 300% of his salary into his DraftKings account, according to the complaint – and over 440% in 2023.Mdallo1990’s average monthly deposits into his DraftKings account increased over 30 timesThe lawsuit alleges negligence, conversion, and violations of the New Jersey Consumer Fraud Act, seeking reimbursement for the funds she says belonged to her and her children and were spent without her knowledge or consent.D’Alessandro’s husband received frequent messages from VIP hosts, according to the complaint. These hosts – used by operators across the industry – provide heavy-spending gamblers with incentives, such as betting credits, merchandise and even tickets to events, to use their platforms.The lawsuit claims that DraftKings trains employees to identify signs of problem gambling and thus should have recognized D’Alessandro’s husband as a problem gambler based on his gambling activity, which the complaint said showed “exponentially higher amounts and frequencies”. Instead, the complaint states he continued to receive incentives.The lawsuit states that in 2020, D’Alessandro’s husband deposited a mean average of $2,000 a month on DraftKings, which increased each year and by 2023, the deposits soared to an average of $64,715 a month, despite him earning roughly $175,000 annually. His betting frequency also jumped from about 1,600 bets per year in 2020 to over 14,000 in 2023.‘A serious disease’: Congress weighs federal gambling crackdown amid growing concernsRead more“Where a normal person would have one or two transactions a day if that, his transactions a day, at the highest rate of his addiction, were between 80 to 100,” D’Alessandro said, according to deposit data she has since obtained.Had DraftKings verified his income, D’Alessandro says, the company would have seen that “his salary alone couldn’t have been funding that level of addiction, so it had to be coming from other sources,” she said. “Where is the company’s responsibility to the families and children of addicted gamblers and other foreseeable victims?“People can go to the bar and drink till they’re blue in the face, but at some point, a bartender has to stop serving them,” she said, noting that in many states bars and bartenders can face legal and civil consequences for serving visibly intoxicated individuals. But she said that there is “nothing here currently when it comes to online betting apps, even when they are visibly addicted”.D’Alessandro’s attorney, Matthew Litt, said that it will never be his argument that casinos or sportsbooks are 100% responsible for the actions of their players. But as things stand, “100% of the responsibility falls on the gambler”, he said. “There’s got to be a sharing of that responsibility.”View image in fullscreenMerchandise that DraftKings sent Lisa D’Alessandro’s husband in Nutley, New Jersey, on 6 February.Photograph: Sydney Walsh/The GuardianThe Guardian sent DraftKings a list of questions regarding D’Alessandro’s lawsuit. A spokesperson for the operator did not comment.DraftKings has not yet filed a formal response to D’Alessandro’s complaint. It has until March to do so, according to Litt.D’Alessandro’s lawsuit is among several filed by Litt against gambling operators, alleging that VIP programs and their hosts have exploited his clients’ gambling addictions. Litt says he frequently hears from problem gamblers, many of whom say they have interacted with VIP hosts.“You just don’t get to these catastrophic levels without it,” Litt said. “That seems to be the trajectory of almost all of these cases, once the VIP has their hooks in them it then goes to those astronomical levels.”Currently, D’Alessandro is focused on rebuilding her savings, restoring the funds in her children’s accounts and paying off debts, she said. She also hopes to raise awareness about gambling addiction and its impact on families.“My income, which I thought went to paying bills, actually went to DraftKings,” she said. “I’ve been working since I graduated to be able to provide for my family, and this feels like a major setback for my children. It feels like they are in a compromised position.”D’Alessandro said it was heartbreaking to learn details of her husband’s addiction. He had been placing bets while she was in labor with their second son, whichcoincided with the Super Bowlthat year, for example, and never paid the hospital bill from the birth. She found it crumpled in a backpack after he left.Americans expected to place record $1.39bn in bets for Super Bowl LIXRead more“I never suspected anything. He hid it so well,” she said. “It’s such an insidious addiction, because it’s on your phone, you can do it from anywhere and nobody knows what you’re doing because we’re all on our phones.”D’Alessandro also discovered DraftKings-branded merchandise including whiskey glasses, hand-signed postcards from his VIP host and a trophy-esque prize with “the crown is yours” written on it, stashed and hidden in a closet in his home office.Sports betting companies try “to make their players feel like they’ve won something”, D’Alessandro said. “The saddest thing they mailed him was this trophy, and it’s like, the biggest winner, but really you’re the biggest loser because you’ve spent so much money.”She is still living at her grandparents’ home with her two sons, both under four. “If I didn’t have my family, I would be on the streets. That is how severe this went.”"

But now it faces the threat of dismantlement, and becoming the next institution under the Trump administration to potentially be rapidly hollowed out from within – a situation that could cause consumers the need to fend for themselves against predatory financial practices. More broad layoffsmay be on the way.“It’s been really stressful to potentially lose my way to support my family as the primary breadwinner,” said one of several CFPB employees who spoke on condition of anonymity due to fear of retaliation. “But the chaos that’s happening is impacting not just the bureau, but consumers and industry.”The trouble began earlier this month, when the newly appointed acting director, Russell Vought, issued a sweeping order halting all agency operations. Staff were instructed not to perform any work tasks without explicit written approval. The agency’s headquarters was abruptly closed, its website went dark, and its social media accounts were deleted.“This has been unprecedented,” said a second CFPB employee, who joined the financial watchdog just before Donald Trump’s first term. “No administrative tasks, no trainings, we can’t do anything. We were in the middle of exams, doing what we do. And now there are open questions about everything.”The freeze has left both CFPB staff and the financial institutions they oversee in limbo. Ongoing examinations have been suspended mid-process. Statutory deadlines loom with no one authorized to handle them. Even routine consumer-protection functions have ground to a halt.“Right now, they’re not allowed to proceed with any kind of court cases,” a third employee explained. “Any of these cases they’re litigating against any kind of bank is presumably going to be thrown out, which really sucks.”The work stoppage came with a twist: the possible installation of surveillance software on employee computers just days before the shutdown, two current staffers told the Guardian.“People are almost scared to work. There are concerns of keystrokes being monitored,” the first CFPB employee said. “No one wants to get fired for insubordination.”“I would have it open and I’d be, like, jiggling my mouse to keep it green,” the second employee said, “if only because I’m just extremely nervous about what the consequences are of a work stoppage.”The CFPB did not return a request for comment.According to a court order issued on Friday, Trump’s administration came to a temporary agreement not to fire any more CFPB staff, giving workers there an 11th-hour reprieve.In court, union representatives had said they believed the government was planning to eviscerate the CFPB, possibly as soon as the same day, beginning the process of dismissing all remaining staff, canceling the agency’s lease and returning its funds to the Federal Reserve.Friday’s agreement is to remain in place until the court decides on their request for a preliminary injunction halting the Trump administration’s plans.In a consent order negotiated by both sides and signed by US district judge Amy Berman Jackson, the justice department also agreed the government would not to destroy or remove any of the agency’s vast quantities of sensitive consumer and commercial data generated over the last 12 years, or transfer any of its available funds back to the Fed.The climate of fear the Trump administration has created has only been amplified by the tech billionaire Elon Musk’s so-called “department of government efficiency” team, who were granted access to CFPB’s headquarters and computer systems. Hours after their arrival, Musk posted “CFPB RIP” with a tombstone emoji on his social media platform, X.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines USFree newsletterGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The bureau maintains one of the federal government’s largest consumer-complaint databases, containing millions of detailed records about Americans’ personal financial struggles, from mortgage difficulties to credit card disputes. This includes social security numbers, account details and comprehensive financial histories.“Companies submit confidential business information, trade secrets and information about consumers,” the third employee went on. “People reveal very personal, sensitive information, and it seems like there has been very little regard towards protecting that.”Meanwhile, the administration is preparing for even more dramatic cuts. According to legal filings from a federal workers’ union on Thursday, plans are believed to be under way to terminate more than 95% of the bureau’s employees, in effect rendering it impossible for the agency to fulfill any of its statutory functions.Another legal filing from the union that represents CFPB employees on Friday seeks an injunction to prevent further disruption, arguing that Vought’s moves violate separations of powers by obstructing Congress’s mandate to protect American consumers.There are fears that CFPB’s potential demise would leave a massive void in consumer protection. Over the years, some strong enforcement actions included a $120m settlement with student loan servicer Navient over illegal practices, a $175m penalty against Block’s Cash App for inadequate fraud protection and a $3.7bn order against Wells Fargo for mismanagement of auto loans, mortgages and deposit accounts.Still, Trump has been explicit about his intentions to gut the agency. When asked whether his goal was to eliminate the CFPB entirely,he told a press poolon Monday: “I would say, yeah, because we’re trying to get rid of waste, fraud and abuse.” He added: “It was a very important thing to get rid of.”Adding to the confusion, Trump moved to install his own pick atop the watchdog, nominating Jonathan McKernan, the former Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation board member.McKernan, who quit his FDIC post just a day before his nomination, would potentially be moving from an agency focused on banking stability to one focused on consumer protection. He took a parting swipe at financial regulations as he left the FDIC,posting on Xthat he hoped it would “succeed in its mission while also reversing the regulatory overreaches of the last few years”.The actions come despite overwhelming public support for financial protection. ASeptember pollfrom Americans for Financial Reform showed that 91% of voters believe it is important to regulate financial services to ensure they are fair for consumers, including 95% of Democrats, 87% of Republicans and 88% of independents.But the administration is looking to move ahead and dismantle the agency’s infrastructure anyway. As the future of America’s consumer financial watchdog hangs in the balance, its employees remain defiant.“We’re the watchdogs. We do this work to protect all American consumers. It doesn’t matter who they voted for, where they live,” one staffer said. “What matters is that people have rights. There are laws to protect them, and we’re here to do the work to help protect them, and we’re not going to be bullied.”Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationConsumer rightsConsumer affairsUS politicsElon MuskUS domestic policyDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

Because he canGene MarksThe huge size of the US economy means that the president can throw his weight around – and we can’t say we weren’t warnedSat 15 Feb 2025 08.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 15 Feb 2025 08.02 ESTShareWhy isDonald Trumpso obsessed with tariffs? If you ask me, it’s because America is sofreaking huge.California’s economy is bigger than the entire UK’s. Texas’s is larger than all of Canada’s. Florida’s is larger than all of Mexico’s. In its entirety the US economy is abouteight times largerthan both the Canadian and Mexican economies … combined!Trump is a bully sitting on top of the world’s biggest bully – the American economy. Bullies tend to use their fists to overcome others. Sometimes they can be outwitted. But we all know that strength and size means everything.As a bully, Trump uses tariffs as a weapon and he can get away with it. This is what bullies do. He can threaten smaller countries such as Canada and Mexico because he’s bigger and stronger. He can increase tariffs, cut off funding and limit aid to foreign countries because he knows that, without the US, those organizations and governments would be unable to sustain themselves.Why does the US have it in for gig workers?Read moreAnd sure, using tariffs as a tool will have collateral damage at home. I recently spoke to an association of building materials distributors and they aren’t exactly thrilled with the potential that their costs of Canadian lumber could rise by 25%. Neither are e-commerce businesses that buy products from China, food service companies that sell Mexican produce or energy companies that rely on oil supplies from up north.But then again there are others that love tariffs. Have a conversation – as I’ve done – with business owners that make steel and have been undercut by Chinese imports or those in the kitchen cabinet manufacturing industry who have faced the same unfair trading practices that has cost them customers and caused them to contract their investing and hiring. Or talk to auto manufacturers whose cars are being tariffed almostfive times higherwhen trying to sell their vehicles in Europe versus the other way around. Or the American companies that have been historically unable to sell their milk, cheese, butter and chicken in Canada because they face existing tariffsexceeding 200%.It’s true that tariffs will benefit some businesses and hurt others. And it’s true that the rising costs of some products will ultimately trickle down to the consumer. But many businesses I know are determined not to let that happen.For example, I have clients in many industries who have been quietly building inventory over the past few months to cushion their supply. I know others who have been aggressively finding alternative suppliers both in the US and in countries that are less exposed to higher tariffs. Others are simply finding ways to cut costs by doing things like reducing their property footprint or investing in technology and AI to offset the increase in the prices of materials. These strategies are easier said than done. But I’ve seen them being implemented by smart, forward-thinking leaders.Regardless, let’s agree that for both businesses and consumers Trump’s tariff adventures are not great, particularly in the short term. They’re disruptive. They’re causing significant uncertainty. They affect margins. They could potentially hit shoppers right in the pocketbook at a time when prices are already high and incomes are barely keeping up.But Trump doesn’t care. He enjoys being a bully and he knows that – given the size of our economy and our influence around the world – he can be. Will his bullying result in a more level playing field for American companies? Will it drive more investment and jobs at home? Will it result in limiting illegal immigration or the importing of fentanyl? Is he doing this for the right reason, which is to make America stronger?Is his bullying justified? Is any bullying justified?Maybe, maybe not. Most of the times bullying isn’t justified, so history is not in his corner. Unfortunately, the rest of us running businesses and going to the grocery store have no way of knowing. We may bask in his success. Or we may suffer if he fails. But one thing’s for sure: he told us he was going to do this and this is what the country asked for when he was elected.Explore more on these topicsUS small businessEconomicsDonald TrumpUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

For Jannik Sinner, thethree-month ban he has acceptedfrom the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) is less than he might have received had he let the appeal go the natural distance. While he will miss almost nothing of note, at least in terms of grand slams, since the world No 1 will be free to return in early May, ready for the French Open and a shot at a third successive major title and fourth in total.ForWada, Sinner’s partial admission of responsibility holds up a key part of the anti-doping programme: that an individual is responsible for what goes in their body, a responsibility that extends to their entourage. And for the sporting world at large, it’s something of a rebuttal to those who say the superstars get preferential treatment.‘A sad day for tennis’: critics round on Sinner after three-month ban agreedRead moreHaving therecently crowned Australian Open championreceive a drugs ban is not a good look for the sport, of course, but it could have been a lot worse. In appealing against the original decision by the International Tennis Integrity Agency (ITIA) not to ban Sinner, Wada said it was seeking a ban of at least a year.The three-month settlementmeans it will be out of the way before the next grand slam begins at Roland Garros in May.Sinner will be breathing a big sigh of relief, no doubt. A lengthy ban would have been a heavy weight to bear for something that he, the ITIA and Wada all agreed was not his personal fault. If the explanation given – that the clostebol accidentally entered the Italian’s system via contamination from a medicine used by his physio to treat a cut finger – seemed a little fanciful, few inside tennis believed that Sinner had actually tried to cheat.Indeed, had there been a provision in the original case for a three-month ban to be issued, Sinner might have settled for that, too. It would have allowed him to say: ‘OK, I know I did nothing wrong myself, but appreciate that my entourage did and accept my fate.’ As it was, the panel that judged the case was restricted to handing out a minimum 12-month ban if it felt he was guilty.That, too, was surely a factor in the Wada settlement. From 2027, more flexibility will be shown to those who fall foul of contamination in doping cases.Panels will be allowed to issue bans of 0-24 months, offering the likelihood that those who can prove their doping sample was the result of a contamination will receive shorter bans. It’s a safe bet Sinner’s lawyers were stressing that point.View image in fullscreenSimona Halep was also a victim of contamination but was treated less kindly.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianThe settlement will have done little to appease the feeling among some other players, however, especially Simona Halep and Britain’s Tara Moore. Both players were also the victim of contamination: Sinner was treated with greater kindness than they were.The cases of Halep and Moore were significantly different to that of Sinner, more complicated and requiring more assessment, but it’s also true that Sinner, as the world No 1 and a rich man, had the luxury of being able to call on a team of lawyers immediately.Throughout the entire case, Sinner has done a decent job of answering every question asked of him in press conferences, something that may sound like a given, but which nevertheless helps him in terms of the way he is perceived by people inside and outside tennis.All the way through, he has suggested the reason he has been able to continue to play his best tennis has been because his conscience is clear, that he personally had done nothing wrong.With the doubt lifted from his shoulders, it seems likely Sinner will continue to be the man to beat. The Italian lost six matches in 2024 and began this year in brilliant fashion, winning the Australian Open to claim his third major.Three months off might halt his momentum but it might also allow for recovery after an intense period on and off the court. The chances are that when he does return – most likely at the Rome Masters in May – he will do so with his head clear and body rested, which spells bad news for his rivals.Explore more on these topicsJannik SinnerThe ObserverTennisDrugs in sportWadacommentShareReuse this content"

Don’t expect them to put it outRead moreSuch is the challenge that theNBAis trying to fend off right now, the notion that this era of higher-scoring games, more three-pointers than ever before and a lack of rock-’em, sock-’em physicality like there was a couple generations ago is hurting the product.On the one hand, the NBA is about to enter a new series of broadcast and streaming deals that will generate at least $76bn, about three times more than the last deal – so interest still obviously exists. Player salaries are bigger than ever, the league keeps setting attendance record and merchandise keeps flying off shelves.But the NBA keeps hearing the question about the on-court product. And Green is among those that think issues exist. He cited an interview he recently saw where the late Kobe Bryant, who died in 2020, called the game “accidental basketball”.“It’s all penetrate and pitch,” Bryant said in that interview. “You may make the shot, you may not.”Said Green: “He couldn’t have been more right.”Green talked about a recent Golden State game against LeBron James and the Los Angeles Lakers, and how it was “refreshing” to go against a thinker like James – who is notorious for finding weaknesses and exploiting them.“Every possession is some type of chess move,” Green said. “You don’t get that today in the NBA, often. ... You don’t just get that on a regular basis. It’s just who can run faster, who can hit more threes, it’s no substance. I think it’s very boring.”And for a team like the Warriors – with proven champions like Green and Stephen Curry, along with a champion coach in Steve Kerr – the run-and-shoot-all-the-time game isn’t exactly the preferred game plan.“You want to be one of the teams that aren’t playing an accidental game,” Green said. “That’s the challenge.”Explore more on these topicsNBAGolden State WarriorsBasketballUS sportsShareReuse this content"

Their defence, recovering their shape after previous wobbles, ended the match heading away everything Palace threw at them. Victory made it 13 points from six matches since Moyes’s return. Everton are mid-table, above Manchester United, Tottenham and West Ham.“It has been a brilliant start, it was a good win for us, really scrappy,” said Moyes. “They showed great resilience. There’s a much better togetherness with the supporters and the players.”Wednesday’s derby efforts had increased Moyes’s casualty list to nine first-team absentees. Iliman Ndiaye, consistently Everton’s best player, has a medial knee ligament problem. Abdoulaye Doucouré’s high spirits in the Goodison aftermath had landed him a ban.Oliver Glasner and Moyes are old adversaries, the Austrian’s Eintracht Frankfurt beating Moyes’s West Ham on the way to winning the Europa League in 2022. Having beaten West Ham last season, Glasner’s quest for four successive wins over Moyes was denied. “It is not a game we should lose,” said the beaten manager. “We didn’t have the efficiency today.”View image in fullscreenCrystal Palace’s Jean-Philippe Mateta scores their equaliser.Photograph: John Walton/PAEverton began as if unable to shake off residual lactic acid. “Wednesday took so much out of us,” said Moyes. In the opening seconds, Jarrad Branthwaite slashed at fresh air, Wednesday’s last-minute hero James Tarkowski slipped and Jordan Pickford’s low save from Jean-Philippe Mateta rescued blushes.The ever vocal Pickford soon had to save Marc Guéhi’s header. From the resultant corner, Jefferson Lerma’s header flew in, only for the linesman and the video assistant referee to rule that Justin Devenny’s kick had swung out of play and back in. The ever-clunky stadium technology first declared “Goal” then hurriedly corrected itself to “No goal”. Work to do on that user experience. Palace’s finishing, too. A goalmouth scramble presented the ball for Ismaïla Sarr to slap off the crossbar.Within seconds, Tyrick Mitchell’s poor throw offered Alcaraz some space. His pass was poked to Beto, whose finish showed a coolness unseen during Dyche’s tenure. “I am playing with more confidence and joy,” the striker said.Alcaraz, once of Southampton, on loan from Flamengo, goes against the accusation that Moyes distrusts mavericks; he will, as long as other, less glamorous work is put in. Moyes said of his scorers: “Beto’s chances have come through injury, he probably saw a chance to play half a dozen games or so. It was down to him to show if he was capable … Carlos has done a great job for the team.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Last season’s leading lights are struggling with injury. “They are not in the best shape,” said Glasner, though within seconds of play resuming, Mateta had lashed in Guéhi’s overhead flick of a second-ball rebound. VAR dithering led to almost four minutes of delay. The players warming up in the cold, as Anthony Taylor waited for confirmation, added a Busby Berkeley-style formation-dance to farcical proceedings.“We had momentum,” said Glasner, but Everton retained danger on the counter. Jesper Lindstrøm set up Beto for a pair of attempts that Palace goalkeeper Dean Henderson eventually scrambled away. On came Ben Chilwell for a first Selhurst home appearance, Glasner exerting a greater depth of resources over Moyes, who said: “We are so short of players.” Overlapping from left-wing back, the Chelsea loanee scooped a shot that Pickford deflected behind.Moyes then brought on his own former England left-back in Young, 40 in July, to play his part in a win that extended the question of why manager and club ever allowed themselves to be parted.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueThe ObserverCrystal PalaceEvertonmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Beijing Olympic sprint silver medallist Fillon Maillet was left to rue a miss on the first shoot that likely cost him second place.Explore more on these topicsSportShareReuse this content"

And extending her perfect run of six medals in six career slalom races at the world championships.Mikaela Shiffrin’s array of international fans who gathered in the Austrian Alps may have entertained the thought of witnessing those achievements when the American stood third after the opening run Saturday, waving American flags and holding up signs dedicated to the most successful skier of all time.Shiffrin herself, though, never quite expected much of anything beyond where she ultimately finished, fifth, in only her second full slalom race since she suffered severe trauma to her oblique muscles and a deep puncture wound that left her insides draining out of the side of her abdomen during a crash in a giant slalom in Killington, Vermont, 10 weeks ago.Lindsey Vonn sorry for Mikaela Shiffrin comments at skiing world championshipsRead more“Today was just right in line with my expectations,” Shiffrin said. “It’s a strange place to be returning from surgery eight weeks ago, from laying in bed with a drainage tube six weeks ago, to return mid-season in the middle of world championships where everybody is talking about the medals and all the other athletes are fighting and on their top form. And I’m trying to figure out where I even stand in the sport.”While Shiffrin did pair with Breezy Johnson to win a gold in the new team combined event at these worlds, she also withdrew from defending her giant slalom title because of “PTSD-eque” fears related to her fall in Killington.She said it’s all been “maybe one of the biggest learning experiences of my career.”The combined gold was Shiffrin’s 15th career medal at worlds, matching the record set by German skier Christl Cranz in the 1930s. Now she’ll have to wait until the next worlds in Crans Montana, Switzerland, in two years to try and stand alone as the most decorated skier in the competition’s history.Shiffrin had medaled in all six of her previous slalom races at the worlds, starting as a 17-year-old in 2013 when she won the first of four consecutive golds. Then she took bronze in 2021 and silver in 2023.Now that the slalom streak is over, Shiffrin can look back and admire how special it was – rising Croatian talent Zrinka Ljutic called it “alien” – with the realization that it didn’t end because she’s no longer capable of dominating in slalom; it ended only because she’s been slowed by the two most serious crashes of her career the last two seasons.“Yeah, I mean, anything can go wrong. And sometimes it feels like everything does go wrong. But looking back at the course of my career, just to this point – and there’s plenty more to come – it’s incredible to think about everything that my team has done … and that we’ve done together to have such consistency,” Shiffrin said.Besides her crash in Killington, Shiffrin also hit the safety nets at high speed during a downhill last season in Cortina d’Ampezzo, Italy, on the course that will host next year’s Milan-Cortina Olympics.“The last two years have been the biggest proof to the world about how much can go wrong – even when you think you’re doing everything right,” Shiffrin said. “It makes it a little bit scary to move forward because everything feels so unknown. But I guess that’s the mentality we take. And I’m going to try to become comfortable with that unknown feeling.”Shiffrin still finished only five hundredths of a second off the podium – or from earning a medal. Paula Moltzan, her American teammate, came even closer, finishing fourth two hundredths off the podium in a race won by Swiss skier Camille Rast.“Sometimes you’re on the good side of the hundredths and sometimes you’re on the wrong side of the hundredths and that’s the sport,” she said.“But the women who skied top skiing today won the medals and that is how it should be. That was beautiful to watch. It feels almost miraculous that we were even part of it and that we’re here and racing. It’s still a step-by-step process. I’m proud of the things we’ve done right and I’m learning from the things that I can do better.”Moltzan won a bronze in giant slalom and also finished fourth with the US squad in the mixed team parallel event and combined with partner Lauren Macuga.“My worst is fourth, so it’s OK,” Moltzan said. “I’m proud of myself. World champs is a big stage. I competed in the first event and the last event almost. And it’s been a long two weeks, but I’m happy with it.”The 30-year-old Moltzan is less than a year older than Shiffrin, so has witnessed first-hand almost the entirety of her more accomplished teammate’s career.“When you’ve been out for two months, it’s hard to have confidence,” Moltzan said. “[Rast] has got momentum and Mikaela is just kind of starting back up. I think by the end of the season you’ll maybe see her top speed again.”With the World Cup circuit – skiing’s regular season – starting back up again next weekend, Shiffrin plans to race in the two giant slaloms and a slalom in Sestriere, Italy. Her next win will be a record-extending No 100.“I kind of need to start racing GS in order to keep my start list [number] somewhat reasonable,” Shiffrin said. “But I think I can get to the point that my skiing is good enough that I can race without it being dangerous.”Explore more on these topicsMikaela ShiffrinSkiingUS sportsShareReuse this content"

For 80 minutes it seemed fears of being blunt in attack would be founded in a frustrating stalemate at struggling Leicester but then the excellent Ethan Nwaneri dinked a feathery cross into the box and the substitute Mikel Merino, unmarked between Wout Faes and Woyo Coulibaly six yards out, twisted his head to power in the first of his two goals. Merino, who replaced the ineffective Raheem Sterling, sealed victory with his second with three minutes of normal time to play.Keown apologises to Van Nistelrooy for infamous Old Trafford ‘shenanigans’Read moreArteta began with Leandro Trossard as a false 9, Sterling to his left and Nwaneri to his right in a three-pronged attack but until Merino’s header the Arsenal manager must have been wondering how else to penetrate Leicester, now without a clean sheet in 21 matches in all competitions. This was the firstPremier Leaguegame in which Arsenal began without any of Bukayo Saka, Gabriel Martinelli, Gabriel Jesus or Havertz, who is out for the season with a hamstring injury, for almost four years. But Merino ensured Arsenal cut the gap to Liverpool, the leaders who host Wolves on Sunday, to four points for at least 24 hours.It could, as Arteta acknowledged, have been a different picture had another Arsenal teenager, Myles Lewis-Skelly, not made a magnificent intervention. Eight minutes before Merino’s header, Arsenal surrendered possession on halfway and Jordan Ayew sent a ball rolling invitingly across the face of goal. Bobby De Cordova-Reid was lurking at the back post for a tap-in but the 18-year-old Lewis-Skelly spied the danger and flicked his right boot at the ball to make a goal-saving interception and clear for a corner. It was arguably the moment of the match given how the game was poised at that point. A magic touch, as Arteta put it.View image in fullscreenMikel Merino heads Arsenal’s first goal past Leicester’s Mads Hermansen.Photograph: Chris Radburn/ReutersThe game had been approaching the point where William Saliba, a striker at boyhood club Bondy, where he was coached by Kylian Mbappé’s father, must have thought about piling forward from centre-back. Sterling and Trossard fluffed half-chances. Martin Ødegaard slipped in Nwaneri but, on this occasion, the teenager ran out of road. When Arteta withdrew Sterling, it was down to Merino to operate as a forward. “It’s the first time that I’ve played as a striker,” the Spain midfielder said. “It’s a good day to score because I forgot to give my wife a Valentine’s Day present, so I think she’ll appreciate this more than a rose or some chocolates.”It was inevitable that Nwaneri was involved in Arsenal’s significant first goal. The twinkling 17-year-old was Arsenal’s most dangerous player, full of juice, deft in possession, adept off both feet. Just after the hour the teenager’s shot skimmed the top of the Leicester crossbar and with time ticking he cracked a shot against a post, via the fingertips of Mads Hermansen.“Every sign that he’s given us is: ‘Let me go for it, let me go,’” Arteta said of Nwaneri. “When a player is giving you all those signs, you should not stop it. You have to play with that freedom, with that creativity, with that confidence he’s playing with, and the players believe in him. He’s a massive threat, a massive talent and deserves to play.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The substitute Riccardo Calafiori brought the ball forward and passed the baton to Trossard, who curled a ball towards the far post where Merino did the rest. “He’s a good threat because he can smell danger,” Arteta said.For Ruud van Nistelrooy, it was another agonising brush with Arsenal, though before the match Martin Keown did at least apologise for “the shenanigans that went on back in the day”. On the day Leicester’s supporters staged a series of protests against the board, starting at the Local Hero pub, half a mile from the stadium, a couple of home-reared talents helped Arsenal stay in the hunt at the top. “With everything that happened in the last few days, it was important to show how much we want it, we’re really going to go for it and that we believe in what we have,” Arteta said.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueThe ObserverLeicester CityArsenalmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

D’Alessandro filed a lawsuit against DraftKings and its New Jersey casino partners, on behalf of herself and her two children.Photograph: Sydney Walsh/The GuardianWhen Lisa D’Alessandro and her husband had an offer accepted on a new home inNew Jersey, her excitement did not last long. Two days later, when lenders requested bank details for their loan, she discovered their savings account was empty. Her credit card was maxed out, too.It was a Wednesday in November 2023. Earlier that day D’Alessandro’s husband had said he needed to get something from his mother’s house. Preparing dinner for their two young sons, she texted him to ask when he was coming home.“When are you coming home? I’m going to make dinner,” she recalls asking. “I wrote you a letter via email that you need to read,” he replied.“My heart just sank,” D’Alessandro, 32, said in an interview. “I knew something was wrong.”In the letter, she says he admitted to struggling with a secret and debilitatinggamblingaddiction, and that he had spent all their money on DraftKings Sportsbook.How the quick high of ‘fast-food gambling’ ensnared young menRead moreA shocked D’Alessandro rushed to the bank, where she found their accounts – including those holding the proceeds of her 2021 home sale, and money given to their children when they were baptized – drained and overdrafted, she said.It all suddenly clicked, she said. She had recently struggled to log into their bank accounts, which were mostly joint and managed by her husband. The passwords were no longer working.“I realized that he was the one that went in and changed all of the passwords,” she said.D’Alessandro filed for divorce the next day. Her husband never returned to her grandparents’ home, where they had been temporarily staying after selling her house in 2021, she says.In December she filed a lawsuit against DraftKings and itsNew Jerseycasino partners, onbehalf of herself and their two children,accusing the company of “actively” participating in her husband’s addiction “by targeting him with incentives, bonuses, and other gifts to create, nurture, expedite, and/or exacerbate his addiction”.Once the VIP has their hooks in them it then goes to those astronomical levels.Matthew Litt, attorneyIn 2022 and 2023, according to the complaint, DraftKings assigned D’Alessandro’s husband to a “VIP group”, where so-called “VIP hosts” engage high-spending customers and offer perks, credits and gifts to reward them – andencourage continued gambling.The lawsuit claims between January 2020 and January 2024 her husband – identified in the lawsuit only by his username “Mdallo1990” – deposited and lost increasing amounts of money on the sports betting app, including nearly $1m she claims belonged to her and their two children.By 2022, he deposited 300% of his salary into his DraftKings account, according to the complaint – and over 440% in 2023.Mdallo1990’s average monthly deposits into his DraftKings account increased over 30 timesThe lawsuit alleges negligence, conversion, and violations of the New Jersey Consumer Fraud Act, seeking reimbursement for the funds she says belonged to her and her children and were spent without her knowledge or consent.D’Alessandro’s husband received frequent messages from VIP hosts, according to the complaint. These hosts – used by operators across the industry – provide heavy-spending gamblers with incentives, such as betting credits, merchandise and even tickets to events, to use their platforms.The lawsuit claims that DraftKings trains employees to identify signs of problem gambling and thus should have recognized D’Alessandro’s husband as a problem gambler based on his gambling activity, which the complaint said showed “exponentially higher amounts and frequencies”. Instead, the complaint states he continued to receive incentives.The lawsuit states that in 2020, D’Alessandro’s husband deposited a mean average of $2,000 a month on DraftKings, which increased each year and by 2023, the deposits soared to an average of $64,715 a month, despite him earning roughly $175,000 annually. His betting frequency also jumped from about 1,600 bets per year in 2020 to over 14,000 in 2023.‘A serious disease’: Congress weighs federal gambling crackdown amid growing concernsRead more“Where a normal person would have one or two transactions a day if that, his transactions a day, at the highest rate of his addiction, were between 80 to 100,” D’Alessandro said, according to deposit data she has since obtained.Had DraftKings verified his income, D’Alessandro says, the company would have seen that “his salary alone couldn’t have been funding that level of addiction, so it had to be coming from other sources,” she said. “Where is the company’s responsibility to the families and children of addicted gamblers and other foreseeable victims?“People can go to the bar and drink till they’re blue in the face, but at some point, a bartender has to stop serving them,” she said, noting that in many states bars and bartenders can face legal and civil consequences for serving visibly intoxicated individuals. But she said that there is “nothing here currently when it comes to online betting apps, even when they are visibly addicted”.D’Alessandro’s attorney, Matthew Litt, said that it will never be his argument that casinos or sportsbooks are 100% responsible for the actions of their players. But as things stand, “100% of the responsibility falls on the gambler”, he said. “There’s got to be a sharing of that responsibility.”View image in fullscreenMerchandise that DraftKings sent Lisa D’Alessandro’s husband in Nutley, New Jersey, on 6 February.Photograph: Sydney Walsh/The GuardianThe Guardian sent DraftKings a list of questions regarding D’Alessandro’s lawsuit. A spokesperson for the operator did not comment.DraftKings has not yet filed a formal response to D’Alessandro’s complaint. It has until March to do so, according to Litt.D’Alessandro’s lawsuit is among several filed by Litt against gambling operators, alleging that VIP programs and their hosts have exploited his clients’ gambling addictions. Litt says he frequently hears from problem gamblers, many of whom say they have interacted with VIP hosts.“You just don’t get to these catastrophic levels without it,” Litt said. “That seems to be the trajectory of almost all of these cases, once the VIP has their hooks in them it then goes to those astronomical levels.”Currently, D’Alessandro is focused on rebuilding her savings, restoring the funds in her children’s accounts and paying off debts, she said. She also hopes to raise awareness about gambling addiction and its impact on families.“My income, which I thought went to paying bills, actually went to DraftKings,” she said. “I’ve been working since I graduated to be able to provide for my family, and this feels like a major setback for my children. It feels like they are in a compromised position.”D’Alessandro said it was heartbreaking to learn details of her husband’s addiction. He had been placing bets while she was in labor with their second son, whichcoincided with the Super Bowlthat year, for example, and never paid the hospital bill from the birth. She found it crumpled in a backpack after he left.Americans expected to place record $1.39bn in bets for Super Bowl LIXRead more“I never suspected anything. He hid it so well,” she said. “It’s such an insidious addiction, because it’s on your phone, you can do it from anywhere and nobody knows what you’re doing because we’re all on our phones.”D’Alessandro also discovered DraftKings-branded merchandise including whiskey glasses, hand-signed postcards from his VIP host and a trophy-esque prize with “the crown is yours” written on it, stashed and hidden in a closet in his home office.Sports betting companies try “to make their players feel like they’ve won something”, D’Alessandro said. “The saddest thing they mailed him was this trophy, and it’s like, the biggest winner, but really you’re the biggest loser because you’ve spent so much money.”She is still living at her grandparents’ home with her two sons, both under four. “If I didn’t have my family, I would be on the streets. That is how severe this went.”"

But Old Glory DC were safely indoors, preparing for the return of Major League Rugby, the US professional rugby union competition that kicks off year eight this weekend.‘High-energy, risk-taking, intense’ US women’s league shows its rugby colorsRead more“It’s about 73 degrees inside” the St James, the “sports, wellness and entertainment complex” in Springfield, Virginia, where Old Glory train, said Paul Sheehy, with a laugh.His Old Glory co-owner, Chris Dunlavey, laughed too, when asked if he was jealous of RFC Los Angeles, MLR rivals who spent some of preseason in Fiji, where they pushed the Drua of Super Rugby beforegoing down 33-26.The short version is it’s no surprise it’s cold in the mid-Atlantic and in the north-east, where the defending-championNew England Free Jacksplay, but things will warm up once Old Glory start the season in Florida on Saturday, against the Miami Sharks.The league is one team lighter, the Dallas Jackals having withdrawn.“We have 11 teams today that I think are, across the board, the strongest ownership groups we’ve ever had,” said Dunlavey, a partner ina program management firmand club rugby lifer who has co-owned Old Glory with Sheehy (a leadingauto-salesman, once a US Eagles wing) since day onein 2020.“When Paul and I first met Dean Howes, the commissioner at the time, one of the things he told us was that essentially MLR was modeled on the organization and business plan that Major League Soccer had pursued for the preceding 20 years. Which has proven to be a successful formula in terms of a new league in the US.“He told us, ‘You’re going to lose some clubs along the way. You should expect there’s going to be some shakeout between those clubs that develop a really lasting ownership backing and others where they’re just in the wrong business or the right circumstances don’t transpire to keep them functioning. You’re going to lose some teams.“That doesn’t mean that’s a threat to the overall business plan of the league, particularly if your average ownership group is getting stronger and deeper-pocketed, and more professional and more businesslike as time goes on, which I think is what has happened to us.”Year one was 2018. Seven teams took the field. Five are still playing, in San Diego, Houston, Utah, New Orleans and Seattle (champions in2018and2019). But founding teams in Glendale, Colorado, and Austin, Texas, are gone and so are the first LA team (champions in2021, out in 2022) and New York (champions in2022, out in 2023.) Toronto also exited in 2023, while Atlanta moved west, to become RFCLA.Hailing anew TV deal with ESPN– “I don’t think I’ve ever heard as much positive press and texts and contacts about the league” – Sheehy said: “As we approach [Old Glory’s] season six, we’ll be heading down to Miami. You get a sense when you travel to these stadiums of the progress the league’s making. You can see the fanbase that’s growing. Miami last year was a new team, and they just had an incredible set-up. I had never visited Seattle. I visited them last year, and it was a tremendous game. The Free Jacks play-off game we lost, they put on an excellent show [in Quincy, Massachusetts]. Their fanbase really turns out.“So everywhere you go in this league, you’re seeing growth, you’re seeing excitement, you’re seeing entertainment. Rugby is growing.”That certainly seems to be the case in the DMV – the District of Columbia, Maryland and Virginia – where junior tag rugby flourishes and high-school and college tackle programs range from fledglings to perennial national championship contenders, in the case of Gonzaga, a boys’ high school in DC.Sitting atop all that, MLR is fast and raw. There are a lot of foreign coaches and players, from Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, the Pacific islands, the UK and Europe, Argentina and Uruguay too. Argument rumbles on about how many Americans should be playing, given the pressing need to improve the men’s national team ahead of a US World Cup in 2031.Sheehy and Dunlavey have partnered with the Scottish Rugby Union. This year, they have a Scottish head coach, Simon Cross; a Scotland lock, Rob Harley, as captain; and a capped Scotland full-back in Damian Hoyland. They have signed Steffan Hughes, an experienced center from the Dragons in Wales but the two owners say such imports must help develop homegrown players.Dunlavey said: “I think it was our third year when Paul and I met and determined we were going to make a commitment to what we believe MLR should be about, which is the development of American talent, in support of our international team’s performance and in the broader interest of growing the game and developing interest and loyalty among supporters. We really wanted to be the leading organization within MLR in developing domestic talent.View image in fullscreenJack Iscaro of Old Glory DC takes on the Chicago Hounds defense.Photograph: Old Glory DC“That includes people that are very literally homegrown, who grew up in our area here and went to Gonzaga, learned their rugby there and played for clubs like the Maryland Exiles and went through maybe a division one college program somewhere, but came back to the DMV and played for Old Glory. Then there are others, whether they were born elsewhere but are American eligible, or people that can become US eligible because of family or the time they spend in the country. But it’s really about growing the game here in the US.”Parked at a fittingly all-American spot – the Lincoln Memorial – Sheehy switched on his camera. Pointing out that 23 of the 39-strong Old Glory squad are US-qualified, he said: “A strong US Eagles team certainly is important to us. We are tied to the performance of the US national team with pathway development, like we’ve had for Cory Daniel and Jack Iscaro.”Daniel is a back-rower, born in Silver Spring, Maryland, a convert from college wrestling. Iscaro, a prop, grew up in Olney, also in Maryland, and played rugby at Gonzaga. Last Friday, he deployed to a packedWashington Youth Rugbyfundraiser at Eastern Market, near the US Capitol, speaking to an eager audience and posing patiently for selfies.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We’re not satisfied by any means with the number of American players we’ve had, and it’s certainly something the league has been challenged with. But Chris and I have addressed the team about it: the international talent is here to raise the standard of American play. That’s our belief. That’s not maybe every MLR team, but that is certainly Old Glory.”View image in fullscreenJack Iscaro presses the flesh at a fundraiser for Washington Youth Rugby.Photograph: Washington Youth Rugby.Dunlavey and Sheehy spoke positively of their relationship with Scott Lawrence, the coach who led the US to an encouraging 2024, ahead of a schedule this year that will determine whether the Eagles return to the World Cup in Australia in 2027, having missed out on France last time. Also praised was Anthem RC, a joint venture between MLR, USA Rugby and World Rugby which last year installed a squad of young Americans in Charlotte, North Carolina. Organized at short notice, Anthem lost all 16 games. There’s precedent for that, and for improvement second time out.In 2020, Old Glory won four of five games then saw their first season killed by Covid. They missed the playoffs in 2021 and 2022, then made the eastern final in 2023 and the eliminator last year, both times beaten by New England.Finding a suitable stadium is a perennial challenge in MLR but this season will be Old Glory’s second at the Maryland Soccerplex in Germantown, outside DC but beautifully appointed, seating 5,000 over a superb playing surface.Debt collectors, dodgy turf and medical bills: the brutal realities of life in MLRRead moreSheehy has “heard some of the referees refer to it as the Augusta of Major League Rugby, because of how pristine the grass is”. Dunlavey pointed to a benefit for players: “It’s becoming widely viewed across our league as one of the best, if not the best pitch for players to play on, and we think that’s starting to show up in our injury statistics too. It’s better for our players’ health.”Short version: much of MLR is played on artificial turf, sometimes to players’vocal discomfort. Again: this is frontier rugby. On the injury front, ever a rugby concern, Old Glory is also exploring technological frontiers through a partnership withBrainScope, a medical device that “objectively assesses head injured patients for both brain bleeds and concussions at point of care”.On the field, MLR is no stranger to tweaking laws to speed up the game. This year brings a variety of ways to reduce the number of scrums. Basically, scrums will not be used as a way to restart play, except after forward passes or knocks-on. Fansentimentshave ranged from “why not just play rugby league” to earnest questions about how the US can develop the front-five forwards it needs on the world stage if scrums and their hallowed horriblenesses are limited in league competition.Asked where the change came from, Sheehy and Dunlavey answered diplomatically: the competition committee, on which they do not sit. Anyway, rules are rules and kick-off looms.Dunlavey said: “The coaches know their formula they want to implement. So much of the squad are returning … I’m really excited about where we’re going to go.”Sheehy agreed: “Simon Cross has spent the whole off season working in the DMV area, working with [development side] Young Glory, working with many of our players, and we’re just in a much better place.”Explore more on these topicsRugby unionUSA rugby union teamUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The setback is likely to mean a lengthy lay-off for the Ivory Coast International whose contribution has been signficant of late, scoring six goals in the last 14 games. Manuel Ugarte and Toby Collyer also picked up injuries in training this week, leaving Amorim with scarce options in midfield.Amorim has struggled to turn the ship around and United travel to Tottenham on Sunday, a fixture that started the weekend as 14th v 13th and with a combined total of five wins between them in their past 22 league games.Asked if poor morale among staff at the club was affecting the team, Amorim said: “I think it’s really important for us in the first team, coaches and players, to not ignore that. People are losing their jobs so we have to acknowledge that and the biggest problem is the football, because we spend the money, we are not winning, we are not in Champions League, so the revenues are not the same.“We spent a lot of money in the past and now we have to be careful with the finances. We cannot rebuild the team the way we would like. People are losing their jobs, of course it’s hard to have that feeling of people safe in their job and it affects the environment. We cannot ignore, we acknowledge that problem and I want to say that the responsibility is the first team.“We have to change that. The first part, what we should do is to win at Tottenham. That is the small step to try to help these people, to try not to push the prices of the tickets higher. We are responsible for that.”View image in fullscreenManchester United co-owner Jim Ratcliffe’s new regime has instigated several rounds of redundancies at the club.Photograph: Andrew Couldridge/Action Images/ReutersAfter Ratcliffe’s investment, 250 employees left United in an original round of redundancies last autumn and winter and now the co-owner is seeking to further reduce staffing levels.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The 20-year-oldPatrick Dorgu was the only winter arrival, costing an initial £25.2m. There is an agreement thatUnited will need to sell players before they can invest in new onesthat will fit Amorim’s 3-4-3 formation.The head coach has brought the same strategy that served him well at Sporting, but those he inherited at Old Trafford are yet to thrive in the system. “I think it can be a weakness in the moment,” Amorim said of sticking to his principles. “But then you believe in one thing or another and you have to stick with that. I feel that we focus a lot on the system but the way we want to play the system is completely different than what we are doing at the moment. We are trying to improve.”United have backed Amorim’s methods, showing faith in his carefully constructed philosophy. Time will be required when it comes to an improvement in performance and results as the Portuguese seeks to find a coherent team to play how he wants.Explore more on these topicsManchester UnitedThe ObserverRuben AmorimnewsShareReuse this content"

No sooner had I booked trains and hotels, though, than it emerged Sunderland had accumulated enough Northern Ireland internationals for their League One game against Oxford to be called off. So I did the only reasonable thing you can do in the circumstances, got in touch with the doyen of the non-league scene in the north-east, Harry Pearson, and invited myself along to whichever game he was going to.We ended up at Seaham Red Star v Ashington in Northern League Division One, the ninth tier of English football. I’ve no idea what the score was, although I know Ashington had Steve Harmison’s brother Ben playing at centre-back and an Alice-banded dribbler on the wing, the Pitman Grealish. But most striking was that everybody passed out from the back. The difference from 25 years earlier, when I’d worked the turnstiles at Whitley Bay, was barely credible. I mentioned it to Harry, who explained that it had become entirely normal: the Guardiolisation of English football was universal.Everton’s logic-defying derby leveller reminds us football cannot be tamed | Jonathan LiewRead moreI asked a few coaches about it in the weeks that followed and they all essentially said the same thing: pitches at every level are much better these days. A lot of kids grow up playing on 4G surfaces and even grass pitches are often hybrids. They don’t live in fear of bobbles as they would have done 20-30 years previously, first touches can be taken almost for granted, and so the game becomes far less about pouncing on miscontrols and far more about movement and the manipulation of play to try to create overloads.At the time, this just seemed a natural extension of the way the game had been going since Pep Guardiola became Barcelona manager in 2008: he emerged into a world ripe for his vision of football after improvements in technology, changes to the offside law that had stretched the effective playing area, and the crackdown on intimidatory tackling that reopened the game to diminutive technicians.Guardiola took the principles of Total Footballand extended them into the new environment, changed what seemed possible to the extent that Manchester United players after the 2009 Champions League final defeat by Barcelona spoke of feeling almost humiliated by not having the ball for protracted spells, losing discipline as a result.That template has come to dominate attitudes. Football was once a game of territory, so governed by the impulse to get the ball away from your own goal and towards the opponents’ that match reports were fixated on wind direction. Now it is a game of possession: rather than “they can’t hurt us if the ball is in their half”, the mentality has become “they can’t hurt us if they don’t have the ball”. Managers who challenged that orthodoxy were treated either as dinosaurs (Sam Allardyce), rebellious outsiders (Diego Simeone) or misguided apostates (José Mourinho).It’s Mourinho, perhaps, who is the most interesting of those examples, if only because of the turn he took after being overlooked for the Barcelona job in 2008 to become the anti-Barça. If they played with the ball, he would play without, he decided, coming up with his infamous checklist that, notoriously, included the line: “Whoever has the ball has fear.” Recently it’s come to feel that a lot of players with the ball might benefit from being rather more fearful.Burnley and Southampton in the past two seasons have exemplified the danger for teams who were promoted playing out from the back trying to maintain that approach in the Premier League. Last Sunday, Tottenham had spells when they couldn’t get out of their half, largely because they kept trying to pass it short and ran into the Aston Villa press. Even Manchester City, the team who popularised the approach in England, keep being caught out now. Last Saturday, it was Nico González who was overpowered as he dithered on the ball, leading toLeyton Orient opening the scoring. On Tuesday, it was a misplaced pass from Ederson that led to thesecond Real Madrid equaliser.View image in fullscreenA misplaced pass from Ederson led to Real Madrid’s equaliser from Brahim Díaz.Photograph: Scott Heppell/ReutersWhich has led to the thought that the process wasn’t so inevitable as it seemed in 2021, that maybe passing out from the back has started to become counterproductive as opponents become increasingly adept at setting pressing traps. Roberto De Zerbi’s Brighton demonstrated how a team can trigger the opponents’ press as an attacking move, looking to generate space behind them that can be exploited, but that is a high-risk strategy.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties. For more information see ourPrivacy Policy. We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionBut what is the alternative? Go long and the risk is possession is wasted – all the more so for teams without a target man – the only benefit being that the ball is at least lost a long way from goal. There is no clear halfway house, nor even much of an option for disguise: go long with players dropping to provide a short-passing option as a decoy and the danger is that possession is not merely lost, but there is no chance to set the defensive line before an opposition attack gets within shooting range.Football is entering one of those crux periods in which it’s clear something has to change but it’s not obvious what. The paradigm is familiar: a team starts doing something, opponents react to stop them and then, for a while, a new consensus is reached before the next revolution. It feels as though what is happening now is that pressing structures are able to catch teams passing out from the back often enough that patient buildup from deep can no longer be an unthinking default.At the very least, teams probably need to develop an exit strategy: what do they do if they find the opposition press squeezing them? Perhaps speculative balls into the channels for runners will become a counter to the counter-strategy. Or perhaps passing out from the back, while remaining the approach for the best teams, will become less common for others.Perhaps teams will start going long more as a matter of course, although that would mean the return of big No 9s, who are perhaps already starting to make their comeback. Perhaps Chris Wood is not the throwback he had appeared but the future.Explore more on these topicsFootball tacticsInside footballcommentShareReuse this content"

Levy’s second-class Tottenham Women mired in mediocrityJonathan LiewAmbition for the women’s team – like the men’s – seems based on hanging in there until the big money starts rolling inSat 15 Feb 2025 15.00 ESTShareAcouple of years ago it was reported that Daniel Levy, the man in charge ofTottenham Hotspur, was lobbying to abolish promotion and relegation to and from the Women’s Super League. Levy’s vision was of a steady-state league, with no mobility and therefore no real jeopardy, where the same teams competed for the same stuff every season. How we laughed. As it turned out, he needn’t have gone to the trouble. It pretty much ended up happening anyway.For Tottenham at least, a season that began replete with possibility has buffed down to a blunt point. Marooned in mid-table, eliminated from both cup competitions, safe from relegation and well out of the Champions League race, their last nine games – starting with the north London derby at the Emirates on Sunday – are essentially pure content, dead rubbers, puff football. Will they put in a strong run of results and finish in fifth? Or will they falter and slump to seventh? Tune in to find out!‘Dark day for parks’: Plans to build Spurs academy on London green space approvedRead moreAnd this has pretty much been the story of Spurs in recent years, barring a brief flirtation with relegation in 2022-23: an entire women’s football operation whose success basically turns on whether or not they can finish ahead of Everton. Almost invariably they beat the weaker teams at the bottom. Almost invariably theylose to the big four. Since winning promotion to the WSL in 2019 their record against Arsenal, Chelsea and the two Manchester clubs in all competitions reads: played 54, won two, drawn six, lost 46. All of which raises a salient question: what, really, is the big idea here? What is the growth plan, the blueprint for progress?This is a question that gathers urgency when you examine Tottenham’s systems and processes in more detail. Under Robert Vilahamn, Spurs have sought to play an attractive, high-energy passing style of football that moves the ball quickly up the pitch to create scoring chances. And, you know, who doesn’t love that?In practice, and certainly against the bigger clubs, it works out a little differently. Tottenham pass the ball out from the back. Tottenham get pressed. Tottenham panic wildly. At which point, Tottenham either lose the ball or lump it long. This season Spurs are second in the WSL for touches in their own defensive third and only eighth for touches in the attacking third.And fair enough, this is a defined style. But not really a style that has ever felt sustainable or effective, or threatened to get the best out of the club’s attacking talents. Meanwhile a team that was renowned for being dour but hard to break down under Rehanne Skinner has become the second-leakiest defence in the league.View image in fullscreenNew Spurs signings like Olivia Holdt need a period of adjustment to the Women’s Super League.Photograph: Joe Toth/Tottenham Hotspur FC/ShutterstockNaturally, there are mitigating factors here. The serial injuries to Kit Graham, one of the few players able to take the ball under pressure and progress it with class, have been a major blow. The arrival of Lize Kop in January finally seems to have addressed the chronic lack of a top-class goalkeeper comfortable playing the ball with her feet. New signings such as Olivia Holdt and Anna Csiki still clearly need a period of adjustment to the league. An overreliance on Eveliina Summanen was badly exposed by her injury in January.But perhaps the brutal truth is that for some time now, Tottenham have been trying to play champagne football with Lambrini footballers. An erratic recruitment strategy has swung from spending big on older established stars to signing young players with potential, and still boasts far more misses than hits. Vilahamn’s stated objective is to get Spurs into the Champions League within three years, but if anything the gap to the elite is actually widening.At which point, with regrets, it is necessary to mention the plight of the men’s team, but only because these appear to be common plights with a common root. In a landscape where the biggest clubs are becoming ever more assertive in the transfer market, Levy’s Spurs have remained largely reactive: unwilling to dig deep and invest the sums that might genuinely help them make the leap out of mid-table, unwilling to commit to a defined strategy or identity for more than a couple of years at a time.View image in fullscreenRobert Vilahamn, who recently signed a new contract at Spurs, has the makings of a fine coach.Photograph: Joe Toth/Tottenham Hotspur FC/ShutterstockPeer even closer and the parallels are unmistakable. The made-for-television acquisition of Alex Morgan in 2020 coincides almost perfectly with Levy’s phase of hiring celebrity managers such as José Mourinho and Antonio Conte, straining to project Tottenham as a Proper Big Club. The panic spree of 2022-23 when Bethany England arrived for a record fee and saved Spurs from relegation tracks neatly with the chaos and short-termism of Conte’s final season. Ivan Perisic is basically the male Amy James-Turner. “Abolish relegation” is basically Levy’s bespoke twist on the European Super League.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It should embarrass Levy that the men’s team should have to play a bunch of exhausted teenagers in defence because of inadequate recruitment. It should embarrass him that there are more Arsenal academy graduates than Spurs academy graduates in the women’s first-team squad. That no home-produced player has started in the WSL for them all season.It should embarrass him that when Chloe Morgan left in 2020 she accused Tottenham of treating the women’s team like second-class citizens, that the women were not even allowed to train on the same site as the men until – according to reports – a shocked Alex Morgan had to persuade Levy to let them do so. It should embarrass him that Spurs are so clearly paying the price for those years of undernourishment, and that while Chelsea redraw the lines of the market, they are barely treading water now.But, of course, Levy – like many of his ilk – is basically post-embarrassment, an owner who has confused his longevity and impregnability for a kind of enduring genius. Whose strategy for the women’s team appears to extend no further than simply hanging in there until the really big money starts rolling in. Fifth, seventh: who really cares?There are good people underneath him. Vilahamn – who recently signed a new contract – has the makings of a fine coach. Anew centre of excellencein Enfield, given approval this week over the objections of residents and environmental campaigners, will doubtless start producing the Spurs players of the future. The vision is there. But for now the conviction is absent.“One club” is one of Vilahamn’s favourite phrases. He meets his counterpart Ange Postecoglou on a regular basis. The two teams share backroom staff and facilities and recruitment expertise and a common vision of fast, attacking football. In a way, their fates are yoked together. But a shared blessing can also be a shared curse.Explore more on these topicsTottenham Hotspur WomenSportblogWomen's footballWomen's Super LeagueTottenham HotspurcommentShareReuse this content"

For the Egyptian and Manchester City, joy; for the visitors, despair, as they were sent home reeling, on the back of a 16th consecutive Premier League reverse here.At the break, a home fan suggested it was “the best first 45 minutes I’ve seen all season”: he was not far wrong, because when City are performing like this you see how Pep Guardiola might revive his embattled champions.Emergency striker Merino rescues Arsenal with double to sink LeicesterRead moreWith a quarter of an hour left Marmoush had his moment, as the manager removed him and the jubilant home congregation gave him a richly deserved ovation. Of his star act, Guardiola said: “Three goals – we knew it. In Germany he made good numbers. We knew with his dynamism he would do good. Hopefully he can handle the biggest compliments. It’s so simple, when you play well everybody adapts quickly. When you don’t play well you need time.”Nico González was as impressive, doing the type of cleaning up and work City sorely miss due to the absence of Rodri, to whom his manager compared him.“He is like a mini-Rodri, a big compliment,” said Guardiola. “He’s miles away from Rodri – he’s the best – but we have the feeling he’ll help us in the last part of the season with his presence [because] Nico helps a lot, in the 50/50s [or] if there are 10 balls he wins seven. There was a moment he was correcting Erling [Haaland] – when this happens, you think in the next six, seven years and when we have Rodri back that will give us more presence and stability.”The manager was as approving of a Haaland stampede that zigzagged him into Newcastle’s area and required Dan Burn’s sliding tackle to stop a shot. All day, Newcastle could not cut off City’s attacking pipeline, and soon Marmoush had a first effort, unloading after darting along his left flank.The next time he took aim, he scored, a product of a beautiful route-one move: Ederson advanced and flipped a sweet low 50-yard pass; Kieran Trippier, tracking Marmoush’s left-right diagonal, leaped, missed the ball, and as Martin Dubravka rushed out, the forward’s chip bounced and kissed the open net. Ederson’s assist was the sixth of his career in the Premier League– the most for a goalkeeper.View image in fullscreenOmar Marmoush chips Martin Dubravka for his first goal in Manchester City colours.Photograph: Conor Molloy/ProSports/ShutterstockMarmoush’s second goal in City colours soon followed and had a case for being better than the first. As he and other teammates assembled near Newcastle’s area, Ilkay Gündogan tapped to Marmoush. The initial touch knocked the ball to his right, again Trippier was left a patsy, and the finish, coming from an inside-left channel, defeated Dubravka at the tighter, near corner.For a phase Newcastle camped near Ederson’s goal and went close when a City mix-up allowed Alexander Isak to shoot, John Stones’s intervention doing enough to send the ball wobbling wide.Marmoush’s outing rocketed further, and this was City at their ruthless best: Phil Foden passed to Savinho, who glided along the right, beyond Lewis Hall, and turned the ball into the area for City’s No 7 to steer home.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The corner proved a dud but there was hope, perhaps, that Newcastle could do what Feyenoord did here and claw back asecond half 3-0 deficit. But this soon faded as City kept their foot on the jugular.Haaland hunted down Burn as he meandered across his goal and the No 9 set up Savinho. Then, Josko Gvardiol launched a buccaneering run along the left and had Guardiola imploring the faithful to join in with his claps. An entertaining subplot was the Haaland-Burn tussle that now featured the big striker manhandling the even bigger centre-back at a rare Newcastle free-kick that was theirs after the Norwegian, captain for the day, hurled Bruno Guimarães to the turf.Towards the end a Haaland flick was volleyed in by James McAtee to top off City’s day.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueThe ObserverManchester CityNewcastle Unitedmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Unfortunately, it was neither Marcus Rashford nor Marco Asensio that shone brightest, instead visiting goalkeeper Alex Palmer stole the show with a string of superb saves to earn 10-man Ipswich a hard-fought point.Liam Delap gave the away side a shock lead as Rashford’s former schoolmate Axel Tuanzebe had been sent off for two bookable offences but Ollie Watkins was on hand to equalise from one of his side’s many chances.The match, however, could have been very different. Palmer was signed from West Brom last month by Ipswich to bring calm between the posts. But the experienced goalkeeper almost started life in the top flight disastrously in the opening two minutes. He hesitated when coming out for a ball over the top, allowing Morgan Rogers the advantage; Palmer eventually sprinted out of his box but theAston Villaforward knocked the ball past him and went over, there was minimal contact but a firmer referee might have penalised the goalkeeper and sent him off.View image in fullscreenIpswich Town goalkeeper Alex Palmer (centre) denies Aston Villa.Photograph: Nigel French/PAIf anyone thought this was an omen for Palmer’s Ipswich career, they were very much mistaken. The goalkeeper made numerous top-quality saves after his team had been reduced to 10 men when Tuanzebe was dismissed. Palmer’s route to the top has come through seven loan spells, stopping off at Kidderminster and Oldham, among others. “A brilliant day for him,” the Ipswich head coach, Kieran McKenna, said. “He’s had to work his way to this point. Making a Premier League debut at 28 after all the loans and everything that he’s done in his journey and then to do it back in the Midlands and then to perform like he did, make some of the saves that he did and to end up helping the team get a point. Great day for him and a great start for us.”Prior to Rob Jones dishing out the red card in the 40th minute, Villa had been on top but failed to threaten Palmer’s goal. After Tuanzebe left the field, Villa upped the attacking stakes, pushing Ipswich back inside their own box. The visitors had Palmer to thank for keeping things level with a deft reaction save to tip over a Rogers shot from close range.The home supporters were given their first glimpse of Rashford as a Villa player in the Premier League at the start of the second half. It was another striker that left Manchester for a fresh start that opened the scoring. Omari Hutchinson stayed onside on the right and beat Ian Maatsen on the outside before crossing for former City striker Delap to poke home his 10th of the season and create bedlam in the away end.View image in fullscreenIpswich’s Axel Tuanzebe is shown a red card by referee Robert Jones after picking up a second yellow card against Aston Villa.Photograph: Nick Potts/PAThere was noise from all sections when Maatsen let fly moments later, only to see Palmer produce a stunning save to stop the ball pummelling the netting. For Ipswich, the only thing they could do from this point was waste as much time as possible and put the remaining 10 players behind the ball in the hope of keeping Villa at bay, though their task was complicated by Asensio’s arrival.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Ipswich battled and scrapped but this resulted in Phillips committing a foul on the edge of the area. Rashford assaulted the bar with a vicious free-kick and Watkins was the quickest to react, jabbing into an empty net but the draw leaves Villa ninth. “After the sending off the match changed,” Aston Villa’s manager, Unai Emery, said. “This point is not enough for us but we have to move forward thinking how we can improve, how we can get better and trying to reduce the gap we have with the teams in front of us.”Rashford caused a lot of problems and almost created a 93rd-minute winner when his pullback was turned towards goal by a mixture of Rogers and the Ipswich defender Conor Townsend, but it was fitting that Palmer had the final say in front of his mother in the crowd, clawing the ball behind to ensure 18th-placed Ipswich left on a high as their supporters chanted: “We are staying up” at the full-time whistle.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueThe ObserverAston VillaIpswich Townmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

And while glimpses of attacking threat were on display againstBournemouth, it was ultimately the visitors who, with a 3-1 win, had their fans chanting about Champions League away days in Spain and Italy next season.“Our reality will be at the end of the season,” said the Bournemouth manager, Andoni Iraola, when asked if he was allowed to get as excited as his supporters. “Fortunately for us, it is not the end. If we continue performing well, we may have a chance [to play in the Champions League.] We, as staff and players, cannot start thinking about this. This is not the moment for us to celebrate. Not yet.”Omar Marmoush’s rapid Manchester City hat-trick demolishes NewcastleRead moreThe visitors’ two corners seconds after kick-off were the epitome of early dominance. Their opener came after 14 minutes when Ryan Christie found Dango Ouattara, who cleverly managed to time his run and deftly head home for his seventhPremier Leaguegoal of the season.“[Ouattara] is probably one of the main targets [in the box] for us,” said Iraola. “He is a winger, but you sometimes see wingers who are not No 9s, but if they have the chance to finish a good chance, they will take it.”Two minutes later, Justin Kluivert found Christie in space near the edge of the box and while theSouthamptondefenders watched, expecting each other to engage, the Scot lashed a shot into the bottom corner past a fully stretched Aaron Ramsdale. The goalkeeper directed his frustration towards his captain Jan Bednarek as the visitors celebrated, gesturing wildly at the open gaps.Southampton often struggled to get up the pitch and were so easily pinned back, but the rare times they managed to bypass Bournemouth’s midfield, there were glimmers of promising attacking intent. An early chance saw Welington and Kamaldeen Sulemana combine before the latter’s cross in the box almost found Paul Onuachu.Juric opted for two changes at the break: Lesley Ugochukwu and Yuki Sugawara replacing Nathan Wood and Welington, as Joe Aribo slotted into the back line. The changes left fewer holes in the midfield and early in the second half an Onuachu turn with the drop of the shoulder might have got the hosts on the board if it was not for a well-timed sliding tackle by Illia Zabarnyi.View image in fullscreenSouthampton have lost 20 of their 25 Premier League games this season.Photograph: Andrew Matthews/PA“The Aribo and [Will] Smallbone midfield did not work,” said Juric. “That is why [I made the change]. I think they can play better. In the second half, we needed more dynamic players.”In the 54th minute, Antoine Semenyo’s solo effort almost gave the visitors their third, his sparkling feet weaving through three defenders before his effort was parried by Ramsdale. The Southampton goalkeeper then clawed Christie’s header out from the resulting corner, with goalline technology showing it was millimetres from going in.Bournemouth took their foot off the gas midway through the second half and the hosts used the opportunity to find a lifeline. Aribo won the ball off the substitute Marcus Tavernier before playing it towards Onuachu. His pass found Sulemana, who smashed it low and hard for his first league goal of the season. The hosts, rejuvenated by the home crowd’s emphatic response, pushed hard for an equaliser but Tavernier’s sucker punch from a late counterattack consigned Southampton to their 20th Premier League defeat in 25 matches.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I will not accept the mentality to drop until the last moment.”The win marks Bournemouth’s first league double over Southampton in the 15th campaign in which they have been in the same division. Last season, Iraola achieved a club record of 48 Premier League points. Europe, let alone the top four, would have been a pipe dream at the beginning of the campaign, but the side currently are on 43 points, with 13 matches left. “Is this the way to Barcelona, Bayern Munich, Lazio and Roma?” asked the away section at full time to the tune of Tony Christie’s Amarillo. “Bournemouth boys, we’re taking over.

They had a new striker on the bench, Lucas Paquetá was back from injury and Graham Potter felt bold enough to deploy an adventurous 4-2-3-1 system. It was set up for Paquetá, Jarrod Bowen and Mohammed Kudus to run riot in the first half and for Evan Ferguson to make a goalscoring cameo after joining on loan from Brighton.In the event there were some encouraging flashes from Ferguson when he came on after 45 minutes of dominance fromBrentford. The striker roughed up his markers, almost created an equaliser for Kudus and tested Mark Flekken with a low drive. Yet there was never any prospect of a sustained onslaught from West Ham during a limp second half and, although there have been hints of progress since the departure of Julen Lopetegui last month, a return of one win from Potter’s first six games in charge is a deflating statistic for a side waiting in vain for a charge up the table.Manchester City 4-0 Newcastle, Aston Villa 1-1 Ipswich, and more: football – liveRead moreThere is a flatness to West Ham at the moment, an absence of joy, a sense they are waiting for the season to end. The atmosphere at the London Stadium was awful again and Potter, whose side remain 10 points above the bottom three, could not complain about a second consecutive home defeat.Brentford, a model of consistency and durability in mid-table, earned this 1-0 win through their ability to excel at both sides of the game. Thomas Frank’s side were inventive and commanding during the first half and were solid when the pressure intensified later on. Kevin Schade’s early goal was enough for a third away win this season.“I am very happy with a very impressive first half,” Frank said. “We dominated West Ham. What I like about the second half is we controlled it. We gave one big chance away but apart from that I think we were fine. It is a fully deserved win.”View image in fullscreenJarrod Bowen tries to launch an attack for West Ham.Photograph: Tony O'Brien/ReutersOne of the challenges facing Potter is West Ham’s habit of conceding early. They rarely fly at opponents and seemed unaware of Brentford’s penchant for fast starts. Only four minutes had passed when the visitors broke from a corner and found West Ham’s defence in disarray. Konstantinos Mavrapanos had abandoned his post, Emerson Palmieri made it easy for Bryan Mbeumo to release Schade and the winger scored at the second attempt after seeing Alphonse Areola save his initial effort.It was the 10th goal conceded by West Ham in the opening 10 minutes this season. Potter is hunting for solutions but his switch to a back four did not work. Mavropanos and Max Kilman were exposed in central defence and a double pivot of Tomas Soucek and Edson Álvarez lacked drive. Brentford repeatedly cut through the middle, building through Mikel Damsgaard’s clever movement in the No 10 position.The only negative for Frank was his side’s profligacy. Mbeumo dipped inside from the right and drew a sharp save from Areola. Schade ran clear and hit the woodwork. Yoane Wissa fluffed a header and had two goals disallowed for offside.West Ham were awful. The biggest criticism is that they resembled a Lopetegui team. Kudus struggled in a central role and Potter could not find a way to make the most of being able to start both Bowen and Paquetá for the first time.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The second half was a positive response. Today felt a bit of a step back from us in the first half.”Potter responded with three substitutions at half-time. Ollie Scarles came on for Emerson at left-back, James Ward-Prowse made his first appearances since being recalled from his loan at Nottingham Forest and the introduction of Ferguson for Carlos Soler meant West Ham finally had a focal point in attack. Kudus should have equalised in the 46th minute, only to blaze over from six yards after latching on to Ferguson’s low cross.There were further flurries from West Ham. Paquetá and Scarles went close. Flekken denied Ferguson and Bowen appealed for a penalty after tangling with Keane Lewis-Potter. Frank, though, was right in his assessment: Brentford were comfortable.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueThe ObserverWest Ham UnitedBrentfordmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Ancelotti was further angered early in the second half when the referee awarded Osasuna a penalty after he was called by the VAR to review Eduardo Camavinga’s stamp on Ante Budimir’s foot. The Croatian striker duly scored from the spot to cancel out Kylian Mbappé’s first-half opener.“I believe there were things that have happened in these last three games that everyone has seen and I don’t want to add more, because I’m looking forward to being on the bench in the next game,” Ancelotti said. “The referee booked me after I told him that there was a handball in Osasuna’s penalty area and that he should have gone and check it on the VAR … They must have turned on the VAR later …”View image in fullscreenCarlo Ancelotti gesticulates on the touchline during Real Madrid’s 1-1 draw at Osasuna.Photograph: Rubén Albarrán/Zuma Press Wire/ShutterstockAncelotti also complained about the red card shown to Bellingham, arguing that the English midfielder had not insulted the referee during one of the many argumentsReal Madridplayers had with the official during the game.Ancelotti’s frustration adds more fuel to Real’s clashes with refereeing, after the club complained about the Spanish league’s match officials earlier in February.Real earned a point to stay on top of La Liga in what is shaping up to be a tight title race. Winless in their last three league games, Madrid top the standings with 51 points, one ahead of second-placedAtlético Madridand three clear of Barcelona in third, with Barça playing their game in hand at home to Rayo Vallecano on Monday.Leverkusen left frustrated as Bayern dig in to draw Bundesliga summit meetingRead moreAtlético Madridwasted a golden opportunity to go top as they were held to a 1-1 draw at home toCelta Vigo.

The hosts opened their account in the 33rd minute with Giorgos Masouras, who joined in January, pushing the ball over the line from close range. The Greek scored again two minutes later, intercepting Niklas Süle’s weak backpass to his goalkeeper and beating Gregor Kobel to stun the visitors.A last-gasp goal by the substitute Boulaye Dia earnedLazioa 2-2 home draw againstNapoli, with Antonio Conte’sSerie Aleaders now at risk of being knocked off top spot later this weekend. Napoli, on 56 points, are two points above second-placed Inter, who can move top when they visit Juventus, in fifth, on Sunday.In a fast-paced encounter, Gustav Isaksen put Lazio in front after six minutes with an excellent shot from distance that went in after brushing the underside of the crossbar. Giacomo Raspadori equalised forNapoliseven minutes later, firing the ball through the legs of Ivan Provedel in Lazio’s goal after a Romelu Lukaku pass.Napoli took the lead in the 64th minute after theLaziodefender Adam Marusic put the ball into his own goal. The Lazio midfielder Mattia Zaccagni responded by finding the net with a stunning overhead kick three minutes later but his effort was ruled out for offside. However, Dia levelled for the hosts in the 87th, sending a low shot into the far corner.A wastefulMilanbreathed a sigh of relief as they secured a narrow 1-0 Serie A win at home againstVerona, courtesy of a late Santiago Giménez goal.The gloom that had set in at San Siro lifted in the 75th minute when Giménez headed home after a ball into the box was cleverly directed into his path by Rafael Leão. The Portuguese forward had a late chance to double the lead as he stormed into the box, but the opportunity went begging as Verona cleared to the sound of the final whistle.The result put Milan in seventh place with 41 points, five behind Lazio in fourth, the last qualifying spot for next season’s Champions League. Verona are 15th.Atalantawere held to a 0-0 home draw by mid-tableCagliariin a dull Serie A clash. Gian Piero Gasperini’s side recorded two shots on target as they struggled to find a way past a tight defence, with the visitors rarely leaving their own half.Atalanta thought they took the lead on the hour mark when midfielder Marco Brescianini bundled the ball into the net from a corner, but the goal was ruled out for a foul on Cagliari goalkeeper Elia Caprile.Fabián Ruiz’s second-half strike secured a 1-0 win forParis Saint-GermainatToulouse, extending the visitors’ unbeaten run as well as their lead at the top of Ligue 1.Khvicha Kvaratskhelia, Lee Kang-in, Désiré Doué and Lucas Hernández all had chances to break the deadlock in the first half as Toulouse struggled to find their rhythm. The visitors finally found the net seven minutes after the break when Willian Pacho’s header hit the crossbar and the rebound fell to Ruiz, who slotted home from close range.“On the wings, it was hard to find space. We wanted to keep possession, we had chances and in the end one goal was enough,” said Ruiz. “No matter where I am playing, what I want is to keep competing and do my best,” he added.PSG had several chances to extend their lead, going closest when Bradley Barcola’s shot was brilliantly saved by substitute goalkeeper Kjetil Haug after Guillaume Restes was forced off through injury late in the first half. The hosts struggled to create any real opportunities, but held firm at the back to deny PSG another goal.PSG are the fourth French team to avoid defeat in their first top-flight 22 matches, but Luis Enrique said going the season unbeaten was not among their targets. “The objective is to win the league, if we can achieve that, it’s perfect. There is no objective to remain undefeated,” he said.Amine Gouiri is proving to be an inspired signing forMarseille. The livewire forward scored two superb goals and played a part in the other three as the second-placed side routed Saint-Étienne5-1.

At the same age, reigning Olympic 400m champion Quincy Hall posted 46.98.At this stage there are no plans for the Queensland 100m-200m sensation to focus on the one-lap race.“Today was just a time trial,” Shepard said. “He does one of these every year to test his speed endurance.”In December, as a 16-year-old,Gout broke the men’s national 200m recordwhen he ran 20.04 at the Australian All Schools championships.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toAustralia SportFree newsletterGet a daily roundup of the latest sports news, features and comment from our Australian sports deskEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Brave? Or visionary? The sceptics and gatekeepers certainly had their doubts. But the sight of hundreds of teenage and young girls dancing to Taylor Swift, Rosé and Bruno Mars, and Psy’s Gangnam Style in between races at her brand new event, the Keely Klassic, was quite the riposte.Emma Raducanu takes new wildcard in Dubai in bid to stop losing runRead moreNormally an athletics event in the UK feels a bit like a vicarage tea party. This felt more like being on the Road to Damascus. This observer has certainly never seen a British athletics crowd as young or engaged.What made it even more remarkable still was that Hodgkinson, who was intending to go for the 800m short-track world record, was not competing having injured her hamstring during the week. The races themselves were largely made up of British athletes rather than star names.It helped that organisers had brought in the DJ Tony Perry, who had previously warmed up fans at the 2024 Champions League final and 21 matches during the 2022 World Cup, into the infield.View image in fullscreenKeely Hodgkinson with DJ Tony Perry.Photograph: David Davies/PAIt meant that when the athletes weren’t tearing around the track at the Utilita Arena, there was music and dancing to keep the 4,000 crowd – which was young and largely female – engaged. Hodgkinson and the other athletes also played their part by signing autographs and posing for selfies.“The gold medal has enabled me to put on events like this and to bring a new generation to the sport to enjoy watching it,” said Hodgkinson. “It’s so amazing to hear the stories from little girls and boys who watched me perform in Paris. That’s what really inspires me.”But this was really about the Keely effect in action. When she won gold in Paris she was watched by 9.1 million people in the UK – more than anyone else at the Olympics.It all made the BBC’s decision to relegate the event to the iPlayer even more puzzling – especially as it opted to show reruns ofFlog It!and the filmMr Malcolm’s List, which it had aired as recently as October 2024, instead.The athletics’ record books will show that this was a day where the Olympic bronze medallist Georgia Hunter Bell held off Irish star Sarah Healy to win the women’s 1500m in 4min 0.65sec – while Lina Nielsen and Neil Gourley set British records in the women’s 300m and men’s 1,000m. But the overriding memory was of how different everything was.View image in fullscreenGeorgia Hunter Bell on her way to winning the women’s 1500m during the Keely Klassic at the Utilita Arena, Birmingham.Photograph: David Davies/PA“It felt like a really fun atmosphere,” said Hunter Bell. “When we came out everyone was dancing, so it was a bit different to the usual meet.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The atmosphere was absolutely superb, and we even won prizes for getting our entire row up and dancing.”Perhaps we shouldn’t have been surprised.

On Saturday it emerged that a deal had been reached that would see Sinner banned from 9 February to 4 May – with Wada accepting the Italian player had not deliberately cheated, and allowing him to return before the French Open begins on 25 May.“Wada accepts that Mr Sinner did not intend to cheat and that his exposure to clostebol did not provide any performance-enhancing benefit and took place without his knowledge as the result of negligence of members of his entourage,”Wadasaid in a statement. “However, under the Code and by virtue of Cas precedent, an athlete bears responsibility for the entourage’s negligence.”The case was set to be heard by Cas in April and Sinner was in danger of being banned for up to two years.“This case had been hanging over me now for nearly a year and the process still had a long time to run with a decision maybe only at the end of the year,” Sinner said in a statement. “I have always accepted that I am responsible for my team and realise Wada’s strict rules are an important protection for the sport I love. On that basis I have accepted Wada’s offer to resolve these proceedings on the basis of a three-month sanction.”However Kyrgios was among those to raise their eyebrows at the news, writing on X: “Obviously Sinner’s team have done everything in their power to just go ahead and take a three-month ban, no titles lost, no prize money lost. Guilty or not? Sad day for tennis. Fairness in tennis does not exist.”The British player Liam Broady also expressed his surprise, writing: “Didn’t realise you could reach a settlement regarding a doping ban … Interesting. Back in time for the French Open I guess?”Meanwhile the former British No 1 Tim Henman also criticised the ban as “too convenient” and warned it would leave fans of the sport with a “pretty sour taste”.“First and foremost I don’t think in any way he has been trying to cheat at any stage, I don’t believe that,” said the four-time Wimbledon semi-finalist. “However, when I read this statement this morning it just seems a little bit too convenient. When you’re dealing with drugs in sport it very much has to be black and white, it’s binary, it’s positive or negative, you’re banned or you’re not banned.View image in fullscreenJannik Sinner in action during the Australian Open last month. He could return at the Rome Open in May.Photograph: Joel Carrett/EPA“When you start reading words like settlement or agreement, it feels like there’s been a negotiation and I don’t think that will sit well with the player cohort and the fans of the sport.”However, Sinner’s lawyer Jamie Singer said Wada had confirmed the facts determined by the independent tribunal. “It is clear that Jannik had no intent, no knowledge, and gained no competitive advantage. Regrettably, errors made by members of his team led to this situation,” Singer said.Quick GuideHow do I sign up for sport breaking news alerts?ShowDownload the Guardian app from the iOS App Store on iPhone or the Google Play store on Android by searching for 'The Guardian'.If you already have the Guardian app, make sure you’re on the most recent version.In the Guardian app, tap the Menu button at the bottom right, then go to Settings (the gear icon), then Notifications.Turn on sport notifications.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Sinner is the second high-ranked player to accept a doping ban in recent months after women’s world No 2 Iga Swiatekaccepted a one-month suspensionin November having tested positive for banned substance trimetazidine (TMZ).On Friday, Sinner had posted a video on Instagram of him training in Doha at the Qatar Open, which starts next week.

I’m (not) shockedArwa MahdawiThanks to Donald Trump’s sweeping executive orders attacking a number of terms, ‘women’ is literally being erasedSat 15 Feb 2025 09.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 15 Feb 2025 10.16 ESTShareFrom banning books to policing wordsThanks to the intolerant left, nobody can say the word“women” anymore!Do you remember when that was a major talking point in certain quarters? Prominent columnistswroteendless piecesdeclaring that the word “women”had “become verboten”. The thought police, these people claimed, were forcing everyone to say “bodies with vaginas” and “menstruators” instead. Even the likes ofMargaret Atwoodtweeted articles with headlines like: “Why can’t we say ‘woman’ anymore?”That, of course, wascomplete nonsense. While there was certainly a push for more inclusive language, nobody with any influence was trying tobanthe word “women”.Now, however? Now, it’s a very different story. Thanks to Donald Trump’s sweeping executive orders attacking “gender ideology” and DEI programs, the word “women” – along with a number of other terms – is quite literally being erased. Thelikes of Nasa havebeen busy scrubbing mentions of terms related to women in leadership from public websites in an attempt to comply with Trump’s executive orders, for example. Agencies like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have taken down numerous webpages related to gender in the wake of Trump’s orders – although a federal judgedordered on Tuesdaythat they should be reinstated.Meanwhile, the National Science Foundation (NSF) has an internal list of hot-button words (which include “women”, “gender”, “minority”, “biases”) that they are cross-referencing against active research projects and grant applications. TheWashington Post reportsthat once one of these very dangerous words is identified, staff then have to go through a flowchart to see whether a research project should be flagged for further review.The National Institutes ofHealthand multiple university research departments are going through a similar dystopian exercise. Researchers at the University of California at San Diego, for example, have said their work is now at risk if it contains language deemed potentially problematic, including the word “women”.Rebecca Fielding-Miller, a UCSD public health scientist, told KPBS that the list of banned words circling in scientific communities was Orwellian and would hamper important research. “If I can’t say the word ‘women,’ I can’t tell you that an abortion ban is going to hurt women,” Fielding-Miller said.Fielding-Miller also noted that it was illuminating to see which wordshadn’tbeen flagged as problematic. “I guess a word that’s not on here is ‘men’, and I guess a word that I don’t see on here is ‘white’, so I guess we’ll see what’s going on with white men and what they need,”Fielding-Miller added.Amid all the anxiety about what you are allowed to say in this brave new world, a lot of researchers are erring on the side of caution. Some scientistshave saidthat they are considering self-censoring to improve their chances of getting grants. Others are gravitating towards “safe” topics – like, you know, issues that concern white men. This is a dance we’ve seen many times before: Republicans will advance ambiguous, and possibly unconstitutional, legislation. Because no one knows what the hell is going on or how they might get punished for violating these vague new laws, people self-censor and aggressively police themselves.So, I guess this is where we are now: Republicans aren’t justbanning books, they’re policing words. An administration effectively fronted by Elon Musk – a self-proclaimed “free speech absolutist” – is so touchy about the language that we use that scientists are now self-censoring. It’s so prescriptive about what things are called that it’s blocking journalists from events for continuing to refer to theGulf of Mexicoinstead of the Gulf of America. It’s so obsessed with controlling how we think that it’s erasing references to trans people from the website for theStonewall national monument. Under the disingenuous guise of “restoring freedom of speech”, the Trump administration has made clear it is intent on controlling the very words we use.Errol Musk, who impregnated his former stepdaughter, says Elon is a bad dadElon Musk seems to get some of his extreme views about pro-natalism from his father, Errol, who also has multiple children. Errol has even fathered two kids with his former stepdaughter, who was only four years oldwhen he married her mother. I bring this up because Errol is currently in the newscalling Elon a terrible father. He’s certainly not wrong about that – the Tesla billionaire seems to treat his kids like props rather than people – but his statements bring to mind certain adages about pots and kettles as well as glass houses.Investigation launched into human egg trafficking ringThailand and Georgia have said they are investigating a human-trafficking ringaccused of harvesting human eggsfrom Thai women who came to Georgia thinking they’d be surrogates. Instead, they werereportedly held captiveand had their eggs harvested. This story is just the latest example of the way in which the global egg trade has given rise to black markets and abuse. Last year, for example, aBloomberg Businessweek investigationreported that Greek police had identified up to 75 cases of alleged theft of eggs taken from the ovaries of IVF patients at a clinic on Crete.Infant mortality rates rise in US states with abortion bans, study findsJustyour latest reminderthat anti-abortion activists are in no way “pro-life”.Domestic violence study that strangled rats should not have been approved, animal advocates argueThe rats were non-fatally strangledas part of researchthat aimed to improve the detection of brain injury resulting from intimate partner violence.The Syrian feminists who forged a new world in a land of warThe Guardian has afascinating pieceon the autonomous region of Rojava, in north-eastern Syria, which has a government with arguably the most complete gender equality in the world.A pregnant woman in the West Bank was shot by Israeli soldiersSondos Shalabi, 23,was eight months pregnant.

What I do know is that if you have a campaign which is led by state authorities to say this lawyer is not to be trusted and they’re undermining the Chinese state by engaging in legal work with the United Nations, it sends a green light to [its supporters] to send material like that.”As the leader of Lai’s international legal team, Gallagher has been targeted the most, including “hundreds” of attempts to hack her bank account. There has also been so-called “privilege phishing” – attempts to seek to persuade those who are targeted to divulge sensitive information, whichthe Bar Council has also warned about. Sometimes it is through emails created to appear to have been sent by Gallagher, or her contacts or colleagues.On one occasion an email purporting to be from her was sent to all of the other KCs in her chambers saying she had decided to resign because her work on the Lai case was putting all of them and their families in danger. “I woke up in a hotel room to a whole load of messages saying: ‘Are you OK? What can I do?’” she said.The team have also received WhatsApp calls which show up as being from colleagues when they are not.In March 2023, Gallagher and Jennifer Robinson, who is also on the Lai team, were followed around the UN office in Geneva by a man.. In June 2023, a fellow barrister, Tatyana Eatwell, hada speech at the UN human rights council interruptedby a delegation from China when she mentioned Lai. She said at a separate UN event “they accused us of being criminals … [it was] deeply intimidating”. Such behaviour has been highlighted in the last twoannual reprisals reportsby the UN secretary general.View image in fullscreenJonathan Price, Caoilfhionn Gallagher and Tatyana Eatwell, who cannot travel to countries that have extradition arrangements with China or Hong Kong.Photograph: Alicia Canter/The GuardianActivity obviously emanating from the Chinese state has also included denunciations in government statements and its closely controlled media. Other targeting of the lawyers is not so easily attributable, but Gallagher said: “We think because of the coordination of the emails and the cyber-attacks and the fact that they coincide with key moments in the case, we’ve good reason to believe that they’re state linked.”They have reported online attacks to specialist Metropolitan police officers, who she said had been helpful but were hamstrung by the sophistication of the overseas perpetrators. Gallagher said there were once 32 simultaneous attempts to hack her email account using virtual private networks (VPNs) to make it look as if the perpetrators were based anywhere from Delaware, in the US, to Kazakhstan and South Africa.Clerks and researchers – one of whom had their iPhone cloned – have also been targeted.Jonathan Price, another barrister on the team, said: “We have to be careful about who’s publicly in the team. It’s a conversation we have to have with anyone we use and sometimes the answer is: ‘I’d rather not.’”The lawyers, who cannot travel to countries that have extradition arrangements with China or Hong Kong, have chosen to speak out now because they believe that transnational repression and the targeting of lawyers is growing. Gallaghergave evidence on the issueto the UK parliament’s joint committee on human rights last week.“It is very difficult to deal with,” she said. “They are tactics which are designed to frighten us off doing our job or to make us worse at our jobs. And I think that’s why we’re redoubling our efforts. Because if they hate us – the lawyers – this much, think about how much they hate our client.”When contacted for comment, a spokesperson at China’s UK embassy just condemned Lai.Explore more on these topicsJimmy LaiChinaSurveillanceBarristersHackingnewsShareReuse this content"

But there are more practical and valuable things to achieveSat 15 Feb 2025 11.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 15 Feb 2025 14.46 ESTShareThere’s a moment in the 1967 filmThe Graduatethat has become renowned. At a party thrown by his parents to celebrate his graduation, Benjamin (Dustin Hoffman) is approached by Mr McGuire, an elderly bore who wants to say “just one word” to him: “plastics”. “Exactly how do you mean?”, asks the hapless Ben. “There’s a great future in plastics,” says McGuire. “Think about it.”Listening last week to the spending plans of the techlords who run Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon and Meta leads one to wonder if something analogous might have happened to them on their graduation nights. Except that in their cases, the magic word would have been “AI”.How else could one explain why four companies that reported combined capital expenditure of $246bn in 2024 – up from $151bn in 2023 – nowpropose to spendmore than $320bn this year on AI, a technology for which no business model currently exists that could conceivably provide a reasonable rate of return on such an investment?Why are they doing it? Several reasons come to mind, none of them impressive, and all involving the fantasy of getting to artificial general intelligence (AGI). First off, there’s plain old Fomo – fear of missing out – which leads to a conviction that each can’t risk not being in the game. Then there’s terror that there might be an immense “first-mover advantage” for whoever gets to the mythical goal first, with the winner becoming master of the universe. One AGI to rule them all, and all that.But the most persuasive explanation for the collective madness is the most mundane. It is that tech companies are so obscenely profitable that if they don’t do something risky and exciting with their Everests of spare cash they might – shock, horror! – have to give most of it back to their shareholders. And they would much prefer to cover the countryside with gigantic aluminium sheds – full of Nvidia chips running white-hot, overwhelming electricity grids, lowering water tables and draining reservoirs – than do that.The current lavish spending plans of the American giants suggest that they haven’t yet got the messageUntil the arrival of China’sDeepSeek-R1, the consensus in the industry could be expressed in Margaret Thatcher’s favourite acronym: “Tina” (There is no alternative). There was no alternative route to AI, it seemed, other than brute-force computing. The Chinese model rather undermines that. It suggests that there are other, less resource-intensive, paths to usable AI. The current lavish spending plans of the US giants suggest that they haven’t yet got the message. Or perhaps it’s just the latest variation on the problem first articulated by Upton Sinclair: that it’s difficult to get someone to understand something if their share options depend on them not understanding it.Either way, an interesting fault line has opened up in the field of artificial intelligence. Felix Martin, a perceptive Reuters columnist,sees itas a forthcoming civil war. “On one side,” he writes, “are those who strive for artificial general intelligence (AGI), the point where machines match or surpass human capabilities. Let’s call them AI Cavaliers. Facing them are AI Roundheads who are focused on the more mundane goal of solving specific problems as efficiently as possible. Deciding which side to back in this AI civil war will be a defining decision for investors in the world’s hottest technology.”It’s a colourful metaphor with more than a grain of truth. My favourite Roundhead isDemis Hassabis, the co-founder ofDeepMind, a Nobel laureate and now a big shot in Google (which bought DeepMind for a song in 2014). Although he’s always said that his ambition is to get to AGI, his company’s work in London has had a markedly different trajectory from that of the brute-force-computing crowd in Silicon Valley. It’s been focused on specific types of applications, and on training AI models on very carefully curated datasets.And it’s had some remarkable successes. It built a machine-learning system, for example, that could read retinal scans at very high speed and accurately pick out ones that needed specialised inspection. DeepMind’sAlphaGomodeldefeated Lee Sedol, the champion Go player, in 2016. More importantly, though, itsAlphaFoldmodel solved a major (and formidably difficult) problem in biochemistry – predicting how proteins fold – and then led to a spin-off company that is using the technology for drug discovery. It’s also built a powerful weather forecasting model which seems to outperform traditional physics-based systems, and tons of other interesting stuff. So if there is going to be a civil war in AI, the Roundheads are the side to be on. And there is a great future in AI, at least in London.What I’ve been readingThe end of programming as we know it?Very perceptiveessay about the future of codingby Tim O’Reilly, one of the sharpest observers of the tech industry, on his website.Misunderstanding the social media crisisAninsightful pieceby the redoubtable Henry Farrell on his Substack, Programmable Mutter.

He isflooding the zonewith a plethora of executive orders, dazing and distracting opponents at home and putting allies and partners abroad on edge.There is no longer a premium for being a close ally or partner of the US. Business is business. To paraphrase a John F Kennedy quote, ask not what America can do for you but what you can do for America.How countries like Australia should react is also taking shape. Some are retaliating, others are taking it on the chin.Understanding the values and interests that underpin Trump’s policies provides a guide to where he may go next.The culture wars loom large in his worldview. Free speech as an absolute value will underpin American approaches to tech regulation at home and abroad.If Trump and the tech bros target Australia’s tight media and tech regulations, the options are to buckle and look weak or make common cause with like-minded jurisdictions like the EU. Are we up for that (and the potential sanctions that may follow)?Australia’s trade minister denies Trump administration claims aluminium imports ‘killing’ US marketRead moreSign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailThe shadow of Trump will hang over our forthcoming election. How to deal with Trump may not be explicitly debated but it may influence voter perceptions of the parties and their leaders.Trump is not overly popular in Australia, except for some on the right who support him uncritically. A poll after the Trump election showed support for the alliance dipping; more Australians wanted Kamala Harris to win the election. This should be no surprise. Australia’s compulsory and preferential voting system and independent election commission hews politics towards the centre.Australians are also suspicious of importing foreign political brands.Peter Dutton has claimed to be better placed to deal with Trump. What this means in practice is yet to be spelt out. It implies that ideological affinity may get Australia better (more lenient?) treatment in DC. But that is only one side of the coin. The other is who is best placed to make Australia more resilient and stronger in a world where our main ally no longer seeks to underwrite the global rules-based order?The steel and aluminium tariffs announced this week have woken Australians up to the reality that keeping our heads down will not work. Even if a work-around is found, the levies on China and other general tariff increases in the offing will have flow-on consequences for Australia.Strong, confident economies will be better placed to cope with the fallout of Trumpism and find creative ways to achieve mutual advantage with the new administration. The Trumpers respect strength and measured pushback. We can invert the deal-making mentality in DC to our advantage. This is more sensible than retaliation that brings costs and resolves nothing.While Dutton may adopt some Trump-like policies, he will not go full Trump. Dutton is a mainstream conservative and institutionalist, who respects parliamentary and party structures. He wants to govern those structures rather than disrupt them.Trump is a disrupter and agent of chaos, the tribune of the outsiders who want to drain the Washington swamp. He has little interest in the arcane processes of government and governs like he did at Trump Corporation. Nor does he have regard for traditional party structures. He has recast the Republican party in his image and attracted non-traditional Republican voters.Like Trump, Dutton has been pushing a strong leader image. His nuclear stance and position on antisemitism play in to that. He has taken a populist economic turn with big business, pushing back against alleged price gouging and decrying the willingness of some corporates to take a stance on social issues rather than stick to their knitting to maximise shareholder value.In an apparent nod to Trump’s Department of Government Efficiency, Dutton has appointed a spokesperson on government efficiency. The proliferation of Welcome to Country ceremonies has been criticised and federal funding will be cut back. He has also attacked cultural diversity roles.On the other side of the ledger, Dutton has vowed not to withdraw from the Paris agreement on climate or walk back the Coalition commitment to net zero by 2050. He is defying some strong backers who want to follow the full Trump playbook on climate. He shut down a nascent debate on the abortion laws. He championed the age restriction on access to social media and supported the news bargaining code. Both are policies that the tech bros in the US would have issues with.Dutton’s job is to make the government the issue: are you better off than three years ago? Albanese’s job is to leverage the risk of Dutton PM in a way that is salient to Australians’ daily lives. Portraying Dutton as a recipe for Trumpian chaos only works if Dutton obliges and goes full Trump.The risk of this strategy for Albanese, should he win the election, is that he will face a president who may not be amused to have been dragged into the Australian campaign (and ended up on the losing team).Arthur Sinodinos is a former Australian ambassador to the US.

I’m (not) shockedArwa MahdawiThanks to Donald Trump’s sweeping executive orders attacking a number of terms, ‘women’ is literally being erasedSat 15 Feb 2025 09.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 15 Feb 2025 10.16 ESTShareFrom banning books to policing wordsThanks to the intolerant left, nobody can say the word“women” anymore!Do you remember when that was a major talking point in certain quarters? Prominent columnistswroteendless piecesdeclaring that the word “women”had “become verboten”. The thought police, these people claimed, were forcing everyone to say “bodies with vaginas” and “menstruators” instead. Even the likes ofMargaret Atwoodtweeted articles with headlines like: “Why can’t we say ‘woman’ anymore?”That, of course, wascomplete nonsense. While there was certainly a push for more inclusive language, nobody with any influence was trying tobanthe word “women”.Now, however? Now, it’s a very different story. Thanks to Donald Trump’s sweeping executive orders attacking “gender ideology” and DEI programs, the word “women” – along with a number of other terms – is quite literally being erased. Thelikes of Nasa havebeen busy scrubbing mentions of terms related to women in leadership from public websites in an attempt to comply with Trump’s executive orders, for example. Agencies like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have taken down numerous webpages related to gender in the wake of Trump’s orders – although a federal judgedordered on Tuesdaythat they should be reinstated.Meanwhile, the National Science Foundation (NSF) has an internal list of hot-button words (which include “women”, “gender”, “minority”, “biases”) that they are cross-referencing against active research projects and grant applications. TheWashington Post reportsthat once one of these very dangerous words is identified, staff then have to go through a flowchart to see whether a research project should be flagged for further review.The National Institutes ofHealthand multiple university research departments are going through a similar dystopian exercise. Researchers at the University of California at San Diego, for example, have said their work is now at risk if it contains language deemed potentially problematic, including the word “women”.Rebecca Fielding-Miller, a UCSD public health scientist, told KPBS that the list of banned words circling in scientific communities was Orwellian and would hamper important research. “If I can’t say the word ‘women,’ I can’t tell you that an abortion ban is going to hurt women,” Fielding-Miller said.Fielding-Miller also noted that it was illuminating to see which wordshadn’tbeen flagged as problematic. “I guess a word that’s not on here is ‘men’, and I guess a word that I don’t see on here is ‘white’, so I guess we’ll see what’s going on with white men and what they need,”Fielding-Miller added.Amid all the anxiety about what you are allowed to say in this brave new world, a lot of researchers are erring on the side of caution. Some scientistshave saidthat they are considering self-censoring to improve their chances of getting grants. Others are gravitating towards “safe” topics – like, you know, issues that concern white men. This is a dance we’ve seen many times before: Republicans will advance ambiguous, and possibly unconstitutional, legislation. Because no one knows what the hell is going on or how they might get punished for violating these vague new laws, people self-censor and aggressively police themselves.So, I guess this is where we are now: Republicans aren’t justbanning books, they’re policing words. An administration effectively fronted by Elon Musk – a self-proclaimed “free speech absolutist” – is so touchy about the language that we use that scientists are now self-censoring. It’s so prescriptive about what things are called that it’s blocking journalists from events for continuing to refer to theGulf of Mexicoinstead of the Gulf of America. It’s so obsessed with controlling how we think that it’s erasing references to trans people from the website for theStonewall national monument. Under the disingenuous guise of “restoring freedom of speech”, the Trump administration has made clear it is intent on controlling the very words we use.Errol Musk, who impregnated his former stepdaughter, says Elon is a bad dadElon Musk seems to get some of his extreme views about pro-natalism from his father, Errol, who also has multiple children. Errol has even fathered two kids with his former stepdaughter, who was only four years oldwhen he married her mother. I bring this up because Errol is currently in the newscalling Elon a terrible father. He’s certainly not wrong about that – the Tesla billionaire seems to treat his kids like props rather than people – but his statements bring to mind certain adages about pots and kettles as well as glass houses.Investigation launched into human egg trafficking ringThailand and Georgia have said they are investigating a human-trafficking ringaccused of harvesting human eggsfrom Thai women who came to Georgia thinking they’d be surrogates. Instead, they werereportedly held captiveand had their eggs harvested. This story is just the latest example of the way in which the global egg trade has given rise to black markets and abuse.

The ‘reader effect’ saved usHenry ReeseReading fiction fosters empathy in a polarized world. I’ve learned how arts organizations can do the sameSat 15 Feb 2025 07.00 ESTShareOn 12 August 2022, I was about to begin interviewingSalman Rushdieat the Chautauqua Institution in upstate New York when he was attacked. Now, more than two years later, the trial of the attacker has begun.I was on stage as co-founder of City of Asylum in Pittsburgh, part of aninternational organizationinspired by Rushdie to protect exiled, endangered writers in long-term residencies. Shortly after the attack,I wrote abouthow the audience – an intentional community of readers – rushed to the stage to subdue the attacker. I called this “the reader effect”, a response based on empathy that comes from reading fiction.After testifying at the trial on Thursday, I wonder: are there ways to emulate the “reader effect” in non-readers?Trump chairing a major arts institution would be laughable if it weren’t so deeply troubling | Charlotte HigginsRead moreMost people do not read fiction. In 2022, the US National Endowment for the Arts reported that only 38% of US adults read even a single novel or short story each year, a decline of 17% during the past decade. Not reading stories is like being deprived of emotional, social and cultural oxygen and reinforces the kind of ideological polarization that the journalist Bill Bishop wrote about in The Big Sort: Why the Clustering of Like-Minded America Is Tearing Us Apart, his 2009 book that argues geographical and cultural clustering cause walls of “like-mindedness” that inhibit moderation.There are many self-reinforcing causes of polarization, including wealth, values and race, but why it matters is the resulting loss of empathy and a common pluralistic civic space and purpose.Citizenship,wrote Hahrie Han, director of the civics-focused SNF Agora Institute at Johns Hopkins University, “depends on people believing that we are somehow dependent on one another to protect the dignity of ourselves and our world”. Creating a home, a common “ground beneath our feet”, is both the title of one of Rushdie’s great novels and also his central metaphor for fiction-writing. When he wrote the “Declaration of Independence” that launched the City of Asylum movement, he described the free, “unfettered republic of the tongue” – composed of “imaginary homelands” essential to protecting the more limited freedoms of our own real homelands.Researchers at the University of Torontosimilarly found that reading narrative fiction creates experiences of social interactions in readers – Rushdie’s “imaginary homelands”. Fiction readers become more open and more understanding of themselves and of others different from themselves. The researchers also found that non-readers and even readers of non-fiction are more likely to feel lonely and in need of social support. They are less tolerant of ambiguity and other perspectives and more likely to make decisions that conform to their prior beliefs rather than incorporating other points of view. Rather than instinctively rushing to the stage, they are metaphorically frozen in place, in their seats.With so few people reading fiction, how can we create the “reader effect” among non-readers? City of Asylum Pittsburgh accidentally discovered a clue. It happened in 2005, when Huang Xiang, an exiled poet-in-residence, read a selection of his poems in Chinese, accompanied by the jazz saxophonist Oliver Lake. We had set up a stage and 300 folding chairs on a closed street, with free admission. We saw how neighbors and strangers from all walks of life interacted and the effect of the poet’s performance on this intermingled audience. As one person later wrote: “I did not understand what he was saying, but the way it was presented made your mind go ‘whoop.’”There is no substitute for the intense, prolonged experience of reading fiction. But face-to-face encounters are public experiences analogous to the private experience of reading fiction, creating empathy and humanizing polarity – what the philosopher Emmanuel Levinas called irruptions of hospitality. When they persist, their impact is cumulative.By creatively incorporating the perspective of hospitality into programming and access to it, non-profit arts organizations can each create their own unique “reader effect” and build community in their audiences. As Mr Rushdie once wrote: “No one can be free in isolation. The only free person is the one who lives with other people … in what we call ‘community’ and the warmth that goes with it.”Henry Reese is a retired entrepreneur, who in 2004 co-founded City of Asylum Pittsburgh with his wife, the artist Diane SamuelsExplore more on these topicsSalman RushdieOpinioncommentShareReuse this content"

It’s majorly expanding againSat 15 Feb 2025 06.00 ESTShareNine days into the country’s 47th presidency,Donald Trumpissued an executivememorandumthat contained his latest mass deportation plan. The three-paragraph, 148-word order called for a migrant facility located at the US Naval Base in Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, to be expanded “to full capacity”. The US president later said the camp would house 30,000 migrants.Troop deployments quickly followed and on 4 February, the first planes carrying a few dozen migrants arrived atGuantánamo, with officials sending moreeach day.If the past is any guide, rather than accelerating Trump’s drive for unprecedented mass deportations, the Guantánamo migrant detention plan is destined to repeat the cruelty, confusion, protracted legal battles and staggering financial costs that have defined US detentions at Guantánamo since the September 11 attacks.Today we know Guantánamo mainly as the detention facility that held a total of 780 war on terror detainees over the past 23 years. The cruelty of Guantánamo has been exhaustively documented, notably in the 2023 UN special rapporteur’sreporton the detention facility which described “the depth, severity, and evident nature of many detainees’ current physical and psychological harms”, both those still in Guantánamo and those who had been released as constituting human rights violations.Instead of acting as an effective deterrent, Guantánamo has become a worldwide symbol of US hypocrisy.View image in fullscreenHuman rights activists demand the closure Guantánamo during the Nato summit in Brussels, Belgium, in 2021.Photograph: Johanna Geron/ReutersThe US has also found it impossible to bring to trial those who are charged with conspiring in the attacks of September 11. In sum, once detention in Gitmo was set up, it has seemed doomed to perpetual limbo, all too easy to fill up and nearly impossible to empty.And the prison complex, which currently holds 15 prisoners, has served taxpayers poorly as well. It now operates at an astoundingestimated costof $44m – per prisoner per year – up from $13m in 2019 when the prison held 40 detainees. Every ounce of water used on the base must be created by a single desalinization plant. Food, construction material and all other supplies must be brought in by barge. Troops for security and logistics support must be deployed. Medical personnel as well.The war on terror’s prison is not the only warning sign from the past. For decades before September 11, Guantánamo served as a warehouse for migrants, a zone where laws were conveniently pushed aside, and legal resolution remained elusive.Originally established as a coaling station in 1903, the island military base took on a new role in the 1990s when Cubans, and then Haitians fleeing the overthrow of the democratically elected president, Jean-Bertrand Aristide, were apprehended at sea while seeking asylum in the United States.Culminating in Operation Sea Signal,50,000 migrantswere detained over time, with 24,000 in place at the peak, housed in vast expanses of tent cities where conditions were dangerously unsanitary, legal processes slow to nonexistent, and treatment of the migrants reportedly harsh. Despite the Clinton administration’s promises of processing their cases for asylum, most of the Haitians were summarily returned to Haiti. Cubans as well often remained in legal limbo in one “sad camp” or another.Since then, the Migrant Operations Center (MOC) has continued to serve as a holding facility for migrants apprehended at sea. In 2020-2021, the MOC held an average of 14 detainees at a time. By 2024, 37 migrants were housed there,reportedlyliving in legal limbo, under unsanitary conditions and reported mistreatment and abuse.View image in fullscreenA Guantánamo detainee sleeps on a mattress in 2008.Photograph: Brennan Linsley/APThe sense of deja vu is unsettling.Tom Homanhas referred to those who will be sent to Guantánamo as “the worst of the worst”, the same words used by the secretary of defense, Donald Rumsfeld, when he first set up the post-9/11 prison camp. Tellingly, the first troops sent last week to facilitate the new operations were marines from Camp LeJeune, just as they had been after September 11. And the essential policy parallel holds as well: an administration has given up trying to tackle complex policy problems and has instead embraced viral images of shackled prisoners and tough-talking soundbites that energize its political base.Guantánamo makes a mockery of our claim that we are a nation of laws, prudence and common sense. It has become a global symbol of the US inability to address complex challenges, in this case the unprecedented level of mass migration under way worldwide, with an eye towards a realistic, long-term solution. Nor is there a compelling argument that the threat of detention at Guantánamo will deter those seeking asylum from fears of persecution in their home countries and are willing to risk the dangers of the migration routes.I was a Guantánamo detainee. I’m horrified that Trump wants to keep immigrants there | Mansoor AdayfiRead moreIn a 1996 after-action manual based on interviews with military personnel who had served at Guantánamo during the detention operation of the 1990s, the authors made a series of recommendations. The manual highlighted the need to clarify the “legal basis for the operation” and “for understanding the nature and scope of the mission at the outset”.Such clarity, Gen Joseph Hoar, the head of USCentcom at the time wrote, was “paramount”.The general’s warning was ignored after September 11. It is absent today as well in the rapid, indiscriminate, legally vague and underprepared operation currently under way.It’s time to finally take a lesson from the past. The throughline of Guantánamo represents one thing and one thing only: it exists outside the law. It is ineffective, exorbitantly expensive, and will not solve complex, insufficiently addressed policy messes. Using it to tackle migration will lead predictably not to solving a problem but to creating new ones.Karen J Greenberg is thedirector of the Center on National Security at Fordham Law and author ofThe Least Worst Place: Guantanamo’s First 100DaysMike Lehnert (MajGen USMC ret) served as thejointtaskgroupcommander of the Cuban and Haitian migrant camps during Operation Sea Signal (1995) and the firstjointtaskforcecommander of JTF GITMO (2002)Explore more on these topicsUS politicsOpinionTrump administrationGuantánamo BayBiden administrationCubaHaitiAmericascommentShareReuse this content"

It says,Ash Wednesday, 1983, Nova, in her cursive hand.She told me she’d been meaning to give it to me for some time, but never remembered when we all gathered at Christmas, because of the chatter and the food and the celebration. But this year, she’d left it out so that she wouldn’t forget. Intrigued, my cousins and I huddled around as I opened the box. Inside were the remnants of jewellery and coins, found in the ashes of my grandparent’s house after it burned in the Ash Wednesday bushfires in Mount Macedon.My aunt explained that she’d met someone years ago who worked with the man who made the Melbourne Cup and there had been an assessment of the lumps of melted metal in the box and that some of them were genuine gold. We joked around about the high price of gold per gram, but I knew I’d never sell it. We emptied the box out and began holding the pieces tight in our hands, trying to guess what they once were.Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailView image in fullscreenAn old butter container full of remnants found in the ashes of Nova Weetman’s grandparent’s house after Ash Wednesday.Photograph: Nova WeetmanMy favourite lump is large and misshapen, still a bright gold colour despite the temperature of the fire necessary to melt it, and there is no sign of what it once was. Perhaps a necklace, or a bracelet or a belt buckle. It fits perfectly in my palm, my fingers curling around the outside, and it has a weight to it that is comforting. The coins are blackened and impossible to read, but they are still the intended circular shape. They flake under my fingers, and I tuck them back into the envelope where they have been living for more than 40 years.The contents of the box move me more than I think my aunt expected. I don’t have many items that belonged to my grandparents. I have a chair that I reupholstered last year, and an encyclopaedia my grandfather gave me, but that is all. The metal lumps in this box are a thread to the grandparents I knew when I was very young. When they lived in a house on a bush block on the side of Mount Macedon, with a thin wisp of a creek running at the back of their property, and native trees that stretched to the sun. The house was always cool, even on those blistering days. And not cooled by an air conditioner, but because it was well designed, facing north for the morning sun. I didn’t know my grandparents as well as I would have liked. There was no independent relationship, just that of a child who arrived with her father and watched vignettes of family that felt slightly out of reach. My grandfather was a quiet man. He wore thick cabled woollen jumpers and dark corduroy pants and hunted for new words in the dictionary. Playing Scrabble against him was always brutal, and there was no adjustment for my age. I never won but he made me keen to improve and try to impress him. My grandmother had a wicked laugh and dressed in clothes that I would now love to wear. Suede caps, tweed coats and thick mid-century jewellery. She had immense style. And I knew that even then.In a world of overwhelming choice, I love the whittled-down book selection at my local street library | Jane HowardRead moreI remember the day of the fires. Or at least I think I do. But perhaps my memory has warped with time, and instead of facts, I just recall the haze of worry and stress. It was February 1983, so I would have been at school or perhaps we were given the day off because of the heat. I know that my grandparents were evacuated, sent down the mountain with so many others, failing to fill their car with their favourite things because they thought the worst of the threat had passed. It hadn’t. People died, homes burned, and it was a brutal bushfire that raged across parts of Victoria and into South Australia.Afterwards, my mum who was a budding photographer with a homemade darkroom, took her 35mm Pentax camera and shot photos of the site where my grandparent’s house once stood. I wasn’t allowed to go with my parents that day. But I remember watching Mum later develop the photos in the red light of the darkroom. They were black and white, large format, and she hung them on clips, and we waited for them to dry. I remember being chilled by what I saw.I don’t know who picked over the cooled bones of the house and saved the lumpy metal and coins that I now have. Perhaps it was my grandfather who was a practical man, who understood the land and the bush and the risks of living on the mountain. But now the box lives with me, as a haunting connection to that time, and to the destructive power of a bushfire.Nova Weetman is an award-winning children’s author.

That may still come as a bit of a shock for a nation that, despite everything, has an entrenched habit of considering itself the gold standard.But of course we are not, at least when it comes to prisons. Here are just a few more details from a recent report that compiledtestimonies from officers: rooms flooded with “the smell of urine from rodents”; broken CCTV cameras; floors breaking down into trip hazards; “ongoing legionella issues”; kitchens with no heating for eight years; a jail that has been without hot water since April 2022. Things have got so bad that some prisons are commissioning inmates to do the repairs themselves.Part of the problem is privatised maintenance, which the Prison Officers Association report criticises. In 2015, this was outsourced. A recentNational Audit Office reportfound that a quarter of prison places don’t meet basic fire safety standards, and that the backlog of maintenance works has doubled in the last four years. It has estimated that sorting all this out will cost£2.8bn over five years. But this is not the only reason prisons are in such a state.It all started with a steep increase in the prison population – now far higher than other countries in western Europe. Stiffer maximum sentences, rising prosecutions and swelling numbers of people on remand means that in over three decades the population doubled to 86,000, and is now set to reach100,000 by 2029. Since September, thousands of inmates have been set free early, which has held off a crisis. But only temporarily. By July, critical capacity will probably be reached again.More prisoners has led to overcrowding, as spending on space and officers has not kept up. Inmates are jammed into cells meant for one. When there are too many people in prison, it is harder to manage them, and engage them in activities that lead to rehabilitation. Instead of exercising, studying, working or training, about four in 10 prisoners spend nearly all day locked up, rattling around their cells, bored. Boredom leads to self-harm, drug use and violence. Violence is then exacerbated by the staff shortage, which means it can rapidly get out of control. Between 2020 and 2023, the number of prisoners attacking each othergrew by 57%. Assaults on staff are now higher than at any point before 2015.This exacerbates the problem – it means fewer people want to work in prisons in the first place, and current officers leave. Last week it was reported that one guardgave up his 20-year careerafter being kicked and stamped on by an inmate. There has been a recent exodus of the most seasoned prison officers: in 2017, there were 11,100 guards with more than a decade’s experience. That hasfallen to just 6,681. One in four new recruits leave within a year. A survey suggests that things will get worse still: half of prison officers do not feel safe at work and about 40% plan to leave the service in the next five years.A man jailed for shoplifting pleaded for help in the days leading to his death but was not seen by a mental health clinicianWhen prisons are desperate for recruits, standards go down. Officers now arrive after just a few weeks of training, often done online. And when staff are underprepared or unsuited to the work they are doing, things get grimmer still. A report last week found that four in 10 prisoners who took their own lives in custody weredenied proper healthcare. One man, jailed for shoplifting, pleaded for help and did not eat or sleep in the days leading up to his death, but was not seen by a mental health clinician. Relatives described his treatment as “medieval”.And then there’s a final twist: hellish, violent jails make inmates less fit for the outside world. Reoffending goes up, and yet more people get shovelled into the prison system. The vicious cycle starts again.What’s the solution to all this? The most obvious way to shrink the prison population is to reduce the length of sentences. There is no point giving criminals longer time in jail if they spend it acquiring more violent habits and becoming mentally unwell. But this will be hard for Labour to do. Politicians believe that any signs of being soft on crime will be punished by voters. They are not wrong to be worried – when asked, the public tend to say that sentencing is too lenient.But politicians may underestimate the space for persuasion. It turns out that the view we should be tougher on crime ismainly reserved for violence, and, say, death by dangerous driving. Fewer feel the same about theft, or drug dealing. Giving people more details about sentencing guidelines tends to soften this stance further. Presented with examples and case studies, the public are more inclined to think judgments are not too lenient, after all. We are also keen on the idea of rehabilitation.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The art of persuasion has gone out of fashion in politics, but there is a clear case to be made for shortening some sentences. It could and should be made.One tactic might be to talk about how much we are paying for all this. The average cost of a prison place in 2022-2023 was £52,000. Another would be to highlight the dangers of unrehabilitated prisoners roaming the streets, ready to reoffend. The Netherlands has managed to cut prison numbers dramatically, while keeping crime low. There is just a chance we could do the same.Martha Gill is an Observer columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

However, the cause of his undoing was nothing as trivial as democratic principles; it illustrates a far more profound question that, sooner or later, we all confront: are you a cat or a dog person?Garnor, we may safely conclude, is not a cat person. He quit following allegations that he rigged up a bird table with a firework device so that it explodedwhen a cat paid a visit. The consequences of this shocking but non-lethal incident, which took place back in 2023, have only now come to a head, but it’s fair to say that, as anti-cat statements go, a remote-detonated IED is at the extreme end of things.Apologists for feline terror will doubtless argue that it wasn’t really anti-cat so much as pro-bird. For it’s estimated that domestic cats account for more than 50m avian deaths each year in the UK.As the dog-lover’s favourite walk is up on the moral high ground, that’s a statistic that could appear decisive in the matter of which species of pet is most deserving of our respect and affection. But before anyone cracks open a celebratory can of Chum, let’s note that one Australian study found thatdog-walking in woodlandled to a 35% reduction in bird diversity.Added to which, there’s also a 5,000-10,000 annual UK death count of sheep (mostly lambs) to be placed in the canine con column. Suddenly that familiar hangdog look, often witnessed when a cut of meat goes missing, makes more sense.It’s a measly number compared with the14m sheep slaughtered each yearby human hand in this country, but then this is not about us. It’s abouttheirrelationship with us.“What relationship?” is the question many dog people might ask of cats. For, make no mistake, you could die in a ditch before your average kitty would give you a second look – unless it’s feeding time. Imperious, capricious, indifferent, oblivious and bored are just some of the adjectives that are closely associated with what we must term the feline mystique.If that sounds harsh, it should be said that these are the very same qualities that many of us look for in our partners in human relationships. Perhaps this is why it is often and wrongly claimed that Sigmund Freud said: “Time spent with cats is never wasted”, as if their enigmatic detachment repaid close behavioural study.In reality he once wrote to a friend: “I, as is well known, do not like cats.”The American cultural critic Adam Gopnik once went so far as to argue that all cats are Republicans and all dogs are DemocratsYes, the father of psychoanalysis was actually a dog person, and dog people appreciate other characteristics such as loyalty, obedience and enthusiasm. Or to put it another way, eager subservience.Philosophically speaking, is it better for an animal to be content in servile compliance or miserable in haughty independence? Which is smarter, the stoic conformist or the high-maintenance rebel?Looked at from a different perspective, dogs aren’t submissive and oppressed but noble and collaborative, and cats aren’t suave and independent but selfish and calculating. The American cultural critic Adam Gopnik once went so far as to argue thatall cats are Republicans and all dogs are Democrats, although that was before the rise of Donald Trump and the triumph of fat cats and top dogs.It’s easy to run through their respective plus points: dogs can help the blind but cats are less needy; you can’t take a cat for a cross-country walk but thenyou don’t have to;dogs greet each new morning as if it were their first, while cats are cool if you just want to have a lie-in.Yet this doesn’t establish exactly why we like one more than the other or what the healthiest preference is. Perhaps we are approaching this pet battle from around the wrong way.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

All those wasted hours of scrolling through videos of daredevil cats living their nine lives and hysterical dogs reuniting with someone they haven’t seen for a decade are, like so much in the digital world, siloed endeavours, reaffirming tastes we already hold.The age-old nature of the subject demands a more primal reckoning. It’s not about whom we love most but whom we dislike most. The critical thing about us is not whether we’re cat or dog people but whether we’re anti-cat or anti-dog people. Our latent antipathies may be more telling than our avowed predilections.Garnor clearly nailed his colours to the bird table, but say what you like about cats, they’re not in the habit of leaving a steaming shoe-ready pile on the pavement. And they don’t go to pieces if you go out for the day. Nor do they bark or bite.Cats can be vicious, especially with other cats (and birds), but around humans they’re, well, pussycats. Whereas who has ever encountered a salivating XL bully straining at the leash, and felt wholly at ease? As the old joke goes, it may be safe but you’re not.And yet, and yet, what has a cat ever done for me? They’re all but giant fur balls during the day, as animated as a scatter cushion. Then at night they’re out screaming like wounded banshees, martyrs to petty territorial battles. They are, let’s face it, squarely among life’s withholders and takers, those incurably precious beings whose idea of giving is tolerating your generosity.That doesn’t mean they should be blown up. I’m not deranged. But when I see our 11-year-old terrier growl at some insouciant moggie strolling along the top of the garden wall, I know in this ancient enmity which side of the fence I’m on.

Pringles?”We were midway through at a brilliant new stage adaptation ofAnimal Farmat Stratford East, and the fate of poor Boxer was already becoming clear.It’s 80 years sinceGeorge OrwellpublishedAnimal Farm. He wrote it after returning from the Spanish civil war where he had been horrified by leftist factional fighting. His attempts to get the book published were thwarted by an unwillingness among the establishment to so obviously attack Stalin’s Russia at a time the countries were allies.A response from Jonathan Cape publishers suggested that if the fable were addressed “more generally to dictators and dictatorships at large, then publication would be all right”, but it was too obviously telling the history of post-revolution Russia. Jonathan Cape need not have worried. Watching last week, few in the audience were thinking of Stalin and Trotsky.All must have been thinking about right now and how, little by little, a leader goes from saying, “I am with you” to “I am the chosen one”. How he harnesses minds into paranoia about saboteurs and “enemies of the people”. How he tears up the rules and makes his own. And how power and wealth become ever more controlled by a small group of already powerful people – leaving ordinary people lugging boulders up hills.It may be that after a couple of months of whirlwind actionDonald Trumpwill be content to retire to the golf course, the constitutional guardrails will kick in and things will calm down. If Elon (or Squealer?) allows it. But for now, none of this bodes well for the hard-working American people who put so much faith in Trump. It doesn’t look good for Boxer.Naked anklesView image in fullscreenWhere have all the socks gone?Photograph: waywardcanuck/GuardianWitnessOf all the things that seem to be disappearing from modern life – pubs, libraries, politeness and basic truth – the one most worrying me lately has been… socks. It’s been a cold week. Bitter. With icy blasts gouging the skin. So where have all the socks gone? On draughty station platforms, buffeted bus stops and icy high streets, more and more people are leaving their ankles to brave the cold. There they are wrapped in a bobble hat, quilted jacket and scarf – but with a gaping gap between where their trousers end and their trainers begin. Any socks that are on show are those silly ones that don’t quite hit the ankle bone. It’s all too much. Or certainly not enough for this time of year.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Perhaps if we dispensed with the red flags, people would enjoy this fine play moreSat 15 Feb 2025 04.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 15 Feb 2025 11.33 ESTShareIf your Valentine disappointed you this weekend, spare a thought for the protagonist ofThe Years,the explosive West End play based on the writings of the French novelist and Nobel laureate Annie Ernaux. A teenager is thrilled to discover she has attracted the temporary attention of an older man at summer camp. After he painfully takes her virginity, she gradually realises that he has told half the resort. She finds the word “whore” scribbled across her bathroom mirror. Still she yearns for the validation of his returning desire.The play takes as its subject the full range of life experiences contingent on embodied womanhood. Like the Ernaux memoir from which it draws its name, its heroine tells her story in the plural “we” and speaks for a generation of war-born French women. To the frustration of its artists, however, one of those experiences has captured all the headlines.In a sequence set in the early 1960s a student obtains an illegal abortion. Trigger warnings plaster the walls, website and email communications of the Harold Pinter theatre. These warnings have failed to prevent a nightly sequence in which patrons faint in the aisles, the play is halted and unconscious theatregoers are carried from their seats.The Yearsdeserves to be recognised as a rare achievement: a hit drama that captures a lifetime of female experiences. Instead, to casual observers, it has become “the abortion play”.Last month, when I interviewed its director, Eline Arbo,she lifted the lid on something few British directors are prepared to admit: trigger warnings may be doing more harm than good. Arbo is Norwegian, trained in the Netherlands and now runs the landmark Internationaal Theater Amsterdam:The Yearswas created for a Dutch cast and widely toured in the Netherlands. The first run used no trigger warnings. In each successive transfer, warnings have increased, as have the fainting fits, which seem to border on mass hysteria. “My experience is that there’s more reactions than if you don’t have these,” Arbo told me. Arriving at current performances of the show, the audience “are so aware of it that it enhances the feeling of uncomfortableness”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties. For more information see ourPrivacy Policy. We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionPTSD is rarely triggered by exposure to content that mirrors factual elements of our memoriesA wealth of academic studies support Arbo’s case. Twelve of these studies were drawn together in a 2023 comparative analysis led by Victoria Bridgland of Flinders University, which concluded that “warnings reliably increased anticipatory affect”. In other words, “viewing a trigger warning appears to increase anticipatory anxiety prior to viewing content”, measured by rapidly rising heart rates and aggravated medical distress. Bridgland and her colleagues did not endorse the conservative argument that these prevent students from learning: they concluded that “trigger warnings do not seem to impair or enhance the comprehension of educational material”. If anything, they seem to attract readers, viewers and audiences – even those with trauma histories. We actively choose the thrill of forbidden fruit.My differing visits toThe Yearsbear this out. Last August, the English-language production premiered at theAlmeida theatrein London; on press night, there were some warnings but no gory rumours in advance, and no hysteria. The scene draws its impact both from the language of its storytelling – performed as a monologue by Romola Garai – and an eventual gush of blood emerging from between her legs. If you menstruate, there is nothing new here. Some men, it seems, have had very sheltered lives.The scene is affective, particularly in the final moments in which Garai describes the heartbroken and secretive disposal of the foetus. This material is drawn from Ernaux’s short autofiction workThe Happening,here incorporated by Arbo into a broader narrative drawn from Ernaux’sThe Years. One of the elements made more explicit inThe Happeningthan the play is that months pass while its protagonist is forced to hunt for a provider of illegal abortion. The criminalisation of the procedure thus exacerbates the medical and moral consequences.The Years review – Annie Ernaux’s faint-inducing masterpiece roars into devastating lifeRead moreYet, when I returned to the play, now transferred to the West End and the subject of such discussion, protest and press coverage, you could cut the audience’s anticipatory anxiety with a knife. The sequence takes time to reach its emotive moments: Garai’s character talks us through her first suspicions of pregnancy before we get anywhere near the word “abortion”. The man sitting in front of me, however, had tensed his shoulders to his ears the moment Garai walked on stage. When her character mentioned she had skipped a period, his breathing was already shallow and broken. Before we had reached the sight of blood, he had keeled over. Soon, he was being evacuated limp and inert from the auditorium, his companion shouting for an ambulance. He was not the only one.Fortunately, he didn’t need that ambulance: a paramedic is on site at all performances, and he made a quick recovery. The production team are clearly concerned to protect audiences, staff and their own liabilities: I’ve never seen a front of house team so smoothly trained and the full company have received support from the mental health charityApplause for Thought. One wonders, however, if that concern for liability has driven the ever-escalating cascade of warnings I received before entrusting my psyche to the care of Arbo and her artists. As she told me, speaking perhaps more generally of theatreland, official warnings are “the theatre’s way of giving an excuse for itself”. You can’t go to the loo at the Harold Pinter without being reminded of them.The problem is that trigger warnings are now a sacred cow in the arts. Arbo is a visitor here, but it is career suicide for a progressive director in London to question their value. It doesn’t help that conservatives use the question as a wedge issue on which to pour scorn on “snowflakes” and mock any call for empathy. No one, least of all Arbo, wants to retrigger trauma in the theatre.But amid all this language of concern, we have forgotten that PTSD is rarely triggered by exposure to content that mirrors factual elements of our memories. The person in my life who has PTSD from combat experience can watch war movies without issue. His PTSD – debilitating, medically diagnosed and not something I would wish on anyone – is triggered only by a very specific taste in the mouth, which no one theatre director could possibly predict or warn for. Science tells us that trauma is real: its triggers are as varied as human experience.There is no consensus on whether men or women are more likely to faint inThe Years. What is clear is that the play offers us a rare chance to see women’s lives and bodies on stage, with honesty. It deserves to make the trip to Broadway, where the horror of backstreet abortion is a revived reality – although I wonder what Americans will make of its European honesty about masturbation. Its slew of trigger warnings may help some people but they have also served to sensationalise and disrupt the mundane reality of the women’s stories at its heart.Kate Maltby writes about theatre, politics and cultureExplore more on these topicsTheatreOpinionMental healthAnnie ErnauxWomenRomola GaraiAlmeida theatremental health challengescommentShareReuse this content"

Does it matter, other than to the1.7% ofthe population of England who still worship under its roofs? Since theChurch of Englandcontinues with an “established” role in the life of the nation, the answer is yes.The argument within the C of Eover safeguardingseems endless. It has brought thedownfall of one archbishopand is vexinghis successor. The church is divided over how to police abuse in future, whether through an independent agency or through internal discipline. This in turn reflects whether it sees itself as a dignified institution of state or just another religious sect.The church long ago shifted from being the former to the latter, and this is reflected in its decision to opt chiefly for internal discipline. That is precisely why there has never been a better opportunity to acknowledge the shift. One institutional church, for all its historical glory, cannot still rank as an “established” estate of the realm.Yet in 2023 this church took as its duty the enthroning of Britain’s new head of state. It did so in acoronation of great splendourbut it was, to most people, an incomprehensible ritual. Its oaths, garments and sacred oils could as well have been administered at Stonehenge. Where hereditary monarchs survive across Europe, such ceremonies are rightly secular. The heir to the British throne, Prince William, isknown to be non-churchgoing. It would surely be best to get this all changed in advance of his coronation. The case for a new Reformation is overwhelming. Where is the radical government ready to initiate it?The statistics of decline are now familiar. Average weekly churchgoers numbered just over 1 million in 2009. By 2023 it wasdown by almost a thirdto 693,000.Under half of Britonsclaim to believe in God, down from three-quarters in 1981, while 37% expressly affirm “no religion”. Churches in big cities such as Manchester have suffered badly since Covid-19,losing more than halfof regular worshippers since 1990. The number of worshippers in the diocese of Bath and Wells has fallen 60% in that time. There are nowmore practising Muslimsin Britain than Anglicans.Crumbling churches are ‘UK’s biggest heritage challenge’Read moreThe church’s cumbersome hierarchy must lie at the root of many of its ailments. It is like the Royal Navy havingmore admirals than warships. There are now 108 bishops, of varying degrees of seniority, scattered across 42 dioceses, with bureaucracies that no other sect seems to need. Despite this, some 3,500 churches have shut in the past decade. A “save our parish” lobby fights every closure, but to little avail. An empty church is still empty.None of this need matter to a wider public were it not for one fact: parish churches are not just places of Christian worship. They are the biggest – and usually most beautiful – monument dominating the heart of almost every village and town in Britain. The national church may not matter to the nation, but the local church is prominent at the hub of almost every community. It represents history, ceremony, cultural activity and much of its charitable welfare. Everyone knows their church, even if few pay for it. The C of E’s accumulated repair liability now runs at more than £1bn, with 900 on Historic England’s heritage at risk register.It is simply unrealistic for these glorious buildings to rely on tiny groups of mostly elderly people to look after and pay for them. Local churches and especially unused ones must be somehow transferred to their local communities, as happens across Europe, or they will go the way of medieval castles. Sooner or laterthey will collapseand die.This is why disestablishing the national church is not enough. Already an active element within the Anglican community is virtually neo-Methodist: the house church and lay-led movements. These are informal, sometimes evangelical, groups usually under lay preachers meeting in each other’s homes or elsewhere. Some are mimicking thenon-conformist movementsof the 18th and 19th centuries and establishing self-governing “congregational” churches compared by sceptics to alcoholics anonymous. This is moving outside the Anglican hierarchy.This will do nothing to save church buildings. Lively ones are at least finding new uses, like Herefordshire’s “shop in a church” or Oxfordshire’s pilates centres or thepost office, cafe and soft play areain London’s West Hampstead. They are becoming libraries, gyms, performance spaces, cafeterias and food banks. Some are reverting to being places of meditation and wellbeing. Whatever it may be, like sports centre and museums, they should become the responsibility of local trusts or parish and town councils, with precept taxes to support their upkeep.Great Britain can handle the affairs of state without an official church. Localities are less happy. As high streets decline and pubs close, they face being left with a large building empty and bleak at their heart. It should revert to what it once was: the focus of communal activity. As the Church of England disestablishes nationally, its churches should become “re-established” locally.Simon Jenkins is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

It’s rare (and v.g.) to see a heroine trying to live joyfully despite her griefSat 15 Feb 2025 01.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 15 Feb 2025 10.18 ESTShareBridget Jones is back and once again blazing a new path, this time as a widow. InMad About the Boy, our eternally chaotic but lovable everywoman is navigating single parenthood, dating apps and grief. But unlike most widows in romcoms, she’s not here to wither away in a beige cardigan, politely mourning until society deems it acceptable for her to love again. Instead, she’s in bed with a 29-year-old park ranger named Roxster, proving that healing doesn’t have to be quiet reflection – it can also look like great sex with a younger man.This is where Bridget breaks the mould. In most romantic comedies, women’s grief is pitched as a problem to be solved. We must undergo a period of deep self-reflection before we are allowed back into the world of desire. We must heal, learn and then –maybe –we can be kissed under some twinkly lights at the end of the movie. Hilary Swank’s character in P.S. I Love You waits for divine permission from her dead husband’s letters before even thinking about dating again, whereas poor Demi Moore in Ghost is emotionally tied to Patrick Swayze for ever, choosing to simulate foreplay with a memory over intimacy with the living.But Bridget? She swipes right on Roxster before she’s finished crying. She laughs through awkward sex. She’s messy, unpredictable and refuses to follow the script.And yet, as I watched, I couldn’t help but think: if this were a film about a male widower, none of this would be worth commenting on, only because the big screen mirrors back to us what we are taught in society. After the death of a spouse, men are seen as eligible, while women are seen as wounded. Men’s grief in romcoms is framed as part of their allure. They are given an air of romance, their pain making them more attractive. Sleepless in Seattle opens with Tom Hanks’s character having barely finished the eulogy before women are throwing themselves at him. In Love Actually, Liam Neeson’s character gets a charmingly tragic backstory before he is seamlessly set up with Claudia Schiffer. And who can forget the reason why The Holiday is a firm Christmas favourite among women: Jude Law as “hot single dad” who speaks about his feelings yet barely about his dead wife. His role was not to fumble through self-reinvention but to serve as the dream man who helps a woman believe in love again.View image in fullscreenBridget Jones with her children (Mila Janković and Casper Knopf) in Mad About the Boy.Photograph: Landmark Media/AlamyWatching Bridget refuse to play that game felt oddly personal because I’m a widow, too. My husband Greg died of cancer in 2021 when I was 41, leaving me with two small daughters and a huge void. The scene of Bridget dancing and singing with her children in their house – a regular occurrence in ours – was particularly poignant. For me, it is a true depiction of being the solo parent left behind, trying to provide joy for your children despite being engulfed by grief.Also like Bridget, I have been bombarded with well-meaning but wildly conflicting advice about how I should be grieving while rebuilding my love life: “You’re still young, stay open to love, but don’t rush into anything”, “Focus on yourself first”, “Don’t youwantto find someone new?” Grief doesn’t come with a handbook, yet people seem convinced that if you don’t follow a particular timeline – one that is slow, quiet, and palatable – you’re doing it wrong. The idea that a widow could simply wantconnection, fun or even just good sex without it being framed as either self-destructive or groundbreaking remains strangely radical.Bridget Jones is a welcome reminder of a much more comfortable era | Zoe WilliamsRead moreThat’s what makes Bridget Jones: Mad About the Boy so refreshing. Yes, she grieves. But she also does what so many of us actually do – she makes mistakes, she follows bad advice, she makes dodgy beauty choices. And crucially, she doesn’t wait to behealedbefore living her life again. Healing is messy and contradictory; sometimes it means sex with a hot younger man simply because you want to.Of course, the film isn’t perfect. There’s still an element of the classic “widow’s journey” trope, where grief must ultimately lead to reinvention. By the end of the film, Bridget isn’t just dating again – she has discovered new purpose and self-worth. But for all its predictability, Mad About the Boy still feels like a step forward. It dares to show a widow who isn’t waiting for permission to be happy again. It acknowledges that grief isn’t linear. And most importantly, it lets a woman be messy, funny and desirable after loss – without making it feel like a moral dilemma.Stacey Heale is the author ofNow is Not the Time for Flowers: What No One Tells You About Life, Love and Loss.

The pair discuss censorship, risk-taking, the far right, and ask: are celeb-led plays ruining the West End?Sat 15 Feb 2025 06.55 ESTLast modified on Sat 15 Feb 2025 07.39 ESTShareThe first timeCate Blanchettwas cast in The Seagull, she was in Sydney and in her 20s, a young stage actor playing the part of another young stage actor who was desperate for fame and dizzyingly in love. It was 1997, at Belvoir St theatre, and Blanchett was very much in love herself, having recently got together with the writer-director Andrew Upton, who she would marry later that year. Though the part of Ninain Anton Chekhov’s drama involved far more heartbreak – the character is left emotionally wrecked after being dropped by her lover – and Blanchett remembers “I’d just met Andrew and was madly in love and thought: ‘How am I going to go out every night and be broken open when I’m so deeply happy?’”She clearly pulled it off: among those who saw her in the Australian director Neil Armfield’s production was the director Jane Campion, who reportedly thought Blanchett’s portrayal so “utterly perfect and true” thatshe wished Chekhov had been there to see it.If the audience fell in love with Blanchett then, she in turn fell in love – with Chekhov’s play: “It’s so fuelled by perplexed, dissatisfied, annoyed people who do really strange things, but in Chekhov those people really are anchored by love,” she says today.It’s no surprise that almost 30 years later she is returning to the 1896 comedy at the Barbican theatre in London, to play Irina Arkadina, another actor, but this time in her middle years and supremely starry, having made her name on screen and stage. The original drama sees Chekhov’s typically unfulfilled characters become embroiled in a four-way love triangle: Nina is the aspiring actor who falls for Trigorin, a famous writer romantically attached to Arkadina, whose son, Konstantin is, in turn, besotted with Nina and at loggerheads with the artistic values of his famous mother and her lover. It is a play that treads a delicate line between the comic and tragic, and tussles with questions around the value of theatre as well as intergenerational conflict.Its two central female characters stand at diametric opposites, in love and in the world of the stage. There is an evident synergy between life and art, from Nina to Arkadina, given the trajectory of Blanchett’s career since 1997. “It’s really interesting coming back from inhabiting the equal and opposite end of the spectrum after having a career in theatre,” she says, but she also points out that this production is “profoundly different” because of its director and company of actors, which ranges from Tom Burke and Jason Watkins to Emma Corrin (playing Nina) and Kodi Smit-McPhee (The Power of the Dog) making his professional stage debut as the tormented Konstantin.Helming the production is Thomas Ostermeier, the artistic director of Berlin’s Schaubühne and a leading light of European theatre, who last year staged a reimagining of Ibsen’s An Enemy of the People, starring Matt Smith, in London’s West End. Ostermeier first met Blanchett in 2011, when he took his acclaimed Hamlet (complete with a soil-covered stage) to Sydney, where she and Upton were then co-directors and CEOs of the SydneyTheatreCompany.Ostermeier remembers that first meeting vividly: “I was blown away when someone called me to say ‘Cate Blanchett wants to meet you.’ I was close to peeing my pants on my way to her house in the taxi. Then we stayed in contact and always wanted to work together.”View image in fullscreenLook who’s back … Cate Blanchett and Thomas Ostermeier.Photograph: Manuel Vazquez/The GuardianWe meet at teatime, the end of rehearsals for the day, with Blanchett on one side of a kitchen table and Ostermeier, ever the director, seated at a remove, as if overseeing proceedings. She, in trouser suit, gusts from remote to warm to cold again while he, rangy in casuals and baseball cap, is more smiley and unguarded. Together they are an intense presence, engaged and earnest, with a stilted sense at first that they are performing for each other: the actor and the auteur, in a conversational continuum from the rehearsal room upstairs.This Seagull is a modern version by Ostermeier and Duncan Macmillan (with whom he co-adapted The Enemy of the People) where characters swear and vape. Arkadina, in the script, “loves applause and chiffon” and Konstantin feels desperately overshadowed by his mother’s celebrity. How does Blanchett find her way into playing a character so seemingly self-regarding, even unlikable? “By not using those adjectives. Just putting them to one side … That term ‘unlikable’ – we’re all unlikable, we’re all absurd.” Does Blanchett like the character, then? “I think you have to love them [the characters], which is different. I love my children [she has three sons and a daughter with Upton] but I don’t always like what they do. All of the characters have warts. You have to love them enough to show those bits.”Is it easier to prepare for the part of an actor though, as an actor herself? “I guess so but there’s the cliche of what an actor is. I’m not an actor who makes decisions about what I’m going to do before I get on the floor … The temptation is that you can hide behind the mask of what an actress is meant to be and not confront yourself with who you are as an actor.”It’s follow-spot theatre, where the lead actress or actor is slightly more brightly lit. You used the word ‘cynical’Ostermeier has returned to The Seagull repeatedly, staging it at the Schaubühne only two years ago. Ironically, he is not the biggest fan of the play, he says, but it is an opportunity to gather “a great group of actors”. He certainly feels no reverence towards Chekhov’s vision. “You need to say, ‘Ja, you’re Chekhov, one of the greatest, of course you are, but I don’t need to do another religious bow in front of your altar. I need to wrestle with you, I need to play with you and fight with you.’”It is not a surprising statement from a former enfant terrible, who hit the headlines in 2001 after saying that any director over the age of 40 should retire for being out of touch. Konstantin says exactly that in his play. Given that Ostermeier is now 56, is he poking fun at his younger self through that line?View image in fullscreenCate Blanchett and Thomas Ostermeier.Photograph: Manuel Vazquez/The Guardian“I’m constantly trying to make fun of myself. That’s not the only self-referential moment [in the play],” he says, and points me to Konstantin’s rants about modern theatre being overpriced, elitist, indulgent and irrelevant. You imagine Konstantin might complain about the glut of celebrity-led vehicles, too, which are increasingly dominating West End billboards, from Nichole Scherzinger and Sigourney Weaver to Brie Larson currently in Elektra. Present company excepted, of course, is this cynical stunt-casting designed to extract big bucks from people paying to see their screen idols in the flesh? Ostermeier jumps to the defence of his production. “The actors involved in this show all auditioned for it [except Blanchett] and they were simply the best coming out of those auditions.”Blanchett is thoughtful about the broader picture: “As long as theatre does not become homogenous. It’s about how that person is used and whether their celebrity is harnessed to the cart of the production in a positive way, because sometimes that can really work. But it’s the follow-spot theatre that you’re talking about, where the lead actress or actor is slightly more brightly lit than others … You used the word ‘cynical’. I think you can smell that.”The Seagull is produced by Wessex Grove, who brought An Enemy of the People to the West End as well as Andrew Scott’s one-man Vanya, and A Little Life, starring James Norton. Ben Lowy, one part of the duo who founded the company alongside Emily Vaughan-Barratt, later speaks of the “deep history in England of great actors ‘coming back to their roots,’” while Vaughan-Barratt vouches for the rigorous casting process in this show. Despite Ostermeier’s work internationally, this is only his second English-language production. He has a relatively limited knowledge of British acting talent as a result, Vaughan-Barratt says, and that contains its own purity. “Last year [for An Enemy of the People] he auditioned Paul Hilton, a stalwart of British stage and screen who starred alongside Amy Adams in theWest End’s revival of The Glass Menagerietwo years ago and couldn’t believe how brilliant he was. I was trying to explain how he was one of the best stage actors of our time. To him, it was a cold audition …”Neither Blanchett nor Ostermeier grew up in households with theatre running in the blood. It wasn’t affordable for Blanchett’s single mother (her father died when she was 10) or for Ostermeier’s working-class household in Bavaria. “I’m always sad because I know my parents, who are both dead now, could not have afforded to come [to the Schaubühne],” he says. “Even if they were in Berlin they could not have come. I still have in my head how my mother, every evening, after the dishes were done, would sit in the kitchen like this,” he says, and mimes scribbles numbers on paper.“The money,” says Blanchett.“Yes, every evening, and then it was like: ‘Oh, OK, we have this much left until the end of the week.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

The theatre group was the only place I felt safe and valued for what I am.”Blanchett, meanwhile, was always getting people to sit down and watch stuff that she had made as a child. She went to a music school in Melbourne where she was encouraged to keep doing it. “We had an amazing drama teacher. It was really messy and it felt circus-like, with all the girls who didn’t fit into other groups, all the mis-matched ragamuffins. We just made stuff, and when you make people laugh it’s quite addictive.View image in fullscreenTheatre is not always dangerous enough … Cate Blanchett and director Thomas Ostermeier.Photograph: Manuel Vazquez/The Guardian“But I never, ever, ever thought it was something I would do, or that I could do, that one did with one’s life,” she continues. “I was doing it for fun, and then I was going to go and get a proper job. This is where it’s a vocation I think – it sounds very precious these days when you say that – but in the sense that I didn’t pursue it, it pursued me. Someone suggested I try out for drama school and I did, kind of as a dare, and I got in.”She studied fine arts and economics before that and thought she might get into arts curation, “so I’d be around artists”. In fact, she still dabbles in art now – “I’m not a painter. I doodle, I do ceramics,” she says, almost under her breath, “and nothing that I show people because it’s not [about] the outcome.”Konstantin, in the play, rails against his mother’s brand of middlebrow entertainment, speaking of finding new, experimental forms on the stage. What is the purpose of theatre for Blanchett and Ostermeier? “I love vaudeville, I also love Sarah Kane,” says Blanchett. “It’s not an either/or thing. I love dangerous theatre and it is not always dangerous enough but I’ve made the type of theatre that Konstantin is levelling his criticisms at, too. It’s not like it’s always alive but you do strive for that.”The moment that theatre tells us that rightwing thinking is OK is the moment to leave the countryThomas OstermeierFor Ostermeier, it is about examining human behaviour rather than messaging. “We all know we live in terrible times and I don’t want to see any director telling me what to think about any conflict in the world now, because we would possibly agree, anyway. The moment that theatre tells us that rightwing thinking is OK is the moment to leave the country. This hasn’t happened so far but I’m waiting for it.”It has come perilously close in Germany by the sounds of it: the rightwing party, AfD, “are the only party that have a clearly explicit programme on the politics of culture”, he says, and explains how it has tried to censor the Schaubühne in the past, taking a politically charged show byFalk Richter, called Fear, to court. The AfD ultimately lost the case but “we were terrified” all the same, he says. The party’s rising prominence extended its reach last month to Elon Musk, whoendorsed the AfD as Germany’s “best hope”.Trump might be charged with attempting to capture people through art and culture, too; doesn’t his recent appointment of special Hollywood ambassadors (Sylvester Stallone, Jon Voight and Mel Gibson) seem like a bid to Make Hollywood Great Again? What does Blanchett make of it? “It is exactly what it seems it is, it’s McCarthyism. We’re repeating history.”Curtain up! Meet the new artistic directors with great plans for British theatreRead moreHollywood is less a place than a state of mind, she says, and she seems to have found a healthy distance from it, straddling her time between Los Angeles, Australia and East Sussex. She will always continue doing theatre alongside the screen work, she says. “Of course, I had a film career by default!”Ostermeier is also immersed in both forms, having directed as well as acted in films. Which medium do they prefer, ultimately?“Film,” he says. “It’s more working -class.”“Theatre,” she says in a whisper. “In everything you do, you’re very aware that you’re walking that line with an audience where you’re saying: ‘We’re doing this for you but it is absolutely happening’. Theatre’s like a magic trick. Are you coming with me? Are we going here together?”The Seagull is at Barbican theatre, London, 26 February to 5 April.Explore more on these topicsCate BlanchettTheatreinterviewsShareReuse this content"

In that time, the author has lost both parents, seen Trump become president twice – and finally returned to fiction after a bruising reaction to her comments on genderByCharlotte EdwardesSat 15 Feb 2025 02.00 ESTShareIarrive early to meetChimamanda Ngozi Adichie, the Nigerian-American writer, feminist, author ofAmericanah. Her home, just outside Baltimore, looks Scandinavian somehow amid the snow crust and woodland. Adichie is mid-photoshoot, but the stylist shows me through to the kitchen, telling me to help myself to roast chicken and rice. At a desk in the corner, Adichie’s nine-year-old daughter is wearing headphones and absorbed in what looks like homework. In the middle of the room, watched over by a nanny, are two smiling, 10-month-old boys, one sitting in an activity centre, shrieking with joy, the other gnawing a toy. I’d read a lot about Adichie’s life in the last few years: the sudden death of her father, Nigeria’s first professor of statistics, in 2020, the second shock of her mother’s death months later in 2021. I’d heard her on BBC Radio 4’s Woman’s Hour in 2023 discussing how motherhood is a glorious gift that comes at a cost: “I could probably have written two novels had I not had my child.” Nowhere had I heard that she’d had twins.“You’ve met my babies,” Adichie laughs when she appears in a vibrant orange dress. She sits to remove the hair extensions she has worn for the shoot. “I want to protect my children. I’m OK with having them mentioned, but I don’t want the piece to become about them.” Later, she tells me that for a long time people didn’t know she had a husband, either – she married Ivara Esege, a hospital physician, in 2009. “So, here’s the thing, Nigerians are … ” Nosy? “They want to know about your personal life. Because of that, I am resistant. I very rarely talk about it.”There is no reason we should know everything about the lives of our public intellectuals, but I’m mildly surprised that someone as famous as Adichie has managed to keep two whole children quiet. It’s no mean feat that while navigating the bombshell that babies bring to any life, she is publishing her fourth novel, Dream Count – “at the grand old age of 47” (she checks this on her phone because, “I always forget how old I am. I’m not even joking”) – after a fiction hiatus of more than 10 years.Adichie’s first novel,Purple Hibiscus, published when she was 26 and now a school set text, won her the best first book Commonwealth writers’ prize in 2005. A year later, she publishedHalf of a Yellow Sun, set in the Biafran war, which won numerous awards including the Orange prize (now known as the Women’s prize for fiction). It was her passionate advocacy for womenthat brought her to the mainstream:We Should All be Feminists, her 2012 Tedx Talk, wassampled by Beyoncéin Flawless, and the wordsstamped on a T-shirtby Dior.A writer friend of hers tells me that after the publication of Americanah in 2013, he visited her in Lagos and asked his driver how known she was in her country. The driver thought for a minute, then replied: “Number seven.” As in:Chimamanda Ngozi Adichieis the seventh most famous person in Nigeria. She laughs when I relay this. “I wonder what he would say now, that driver. I’m actually quite pleased that I got up to seven, not being a musician.”Dream Count features the interwoven stories of four women, written in Adichie’s vivid, bracing, highly entertaining style. Like Americanah, it is set in the US and Nigeria, and covers the immigrant experience, the sometimes tense dialogue between Africans and African Americans, the Americanisation of language and thought; as well as mother-daughter relationships, friendship, the pressure on women to marry and have children, and – aptly – late motherhood.“I didn’t want to leave such a long gap between novels,” she says, as we settle in a quieter room. “When I got pregnant [with her daughter], something just happened. I had a number of years in which I was almost existentially frightened that I wouldn’t write again. It was unbearable.When I got pregnant, something happened. I was almost existentially frightened that I wouldn’t write again. It was unbearable“There are expressions like ‘writer’s block’ I don’t like to use because I’m superstitious. But I had many years in which I felt cast out from my creative self, cast out from the part of me that imagines and creates; I just could not reach it. I could write nonfiction, that was fine. But that’s not what my heart wanted.”When her father died of kidney failure, she was in her fiction-not-being-available-to-me phase, but as she struggled for the language to writeNotes on Grief (2021), she noticed that something had loosened. There was a willingness to let go, she says, to surrender control; a feeling similar to the way she’d felt writing fiction. She wasn’t doing anything different – not physically, at least. She was still “scrunched up” with her laptop on her ottoman in the corner of her bedroom. If anything was different, it was how much wiser she felt; how “hyper-aware of how fleeting life is. It makes you think about your own mortality, but also, ‘What do I care about? What matters?’”Initially, she thought she didn’t possess the words to write about her mother. When she tried it head-on, “there was nothing”. So she started Dream Count, “and only when I was almost done did I realise, my God, it’s about my mother. It wasn’t intentional. I’m happy that it’s not a sad book. She wouldn’t want a sad book dedicated to her.”View image in fullscreen‘There’s a lot that has to do with having a female body that isn’t much talked about, and it’s consequential for women’s lives.’Photograph: Jared Soares/The GuardianAdichie speaks with a swinging, almost tidal rhythm to her sentences. Her disapproval, she registers with a vibrating “hmm”. Elsewhere, her voice surrenders wholly to emotion: deepening and broadening when sombre; silky in persuasion; erupting when amused. For instance, spying the photographer and his assistant tiptoeing out of her house, she breaks off to demand: “What? You did not have anything to eat? Come back. As an African, I am offended.” Then she dips into cajoling: “You’ll have to come back, no? Have some chicken. Go on. Please.” Obedient, they retrace their steps to the kitchen.The book is set partly in lockdown, which Adichie saw as a time of accounting and nostalgia for lost selves. Her primary character is Chiamaka (Chia), a travel writer and dreamer, reflecting on her dead-end relationships. Chia is scolded by an aunt for leaving it dangerously late to have children: “Your only option now is IVF,” the aunt tells her. “I know somebody that just had twins at 45. But you have to hurry up if you want to use your own eggs.” Although Chia’s friends tease her about the “body count” of exes who have wasted her time – and years of peak fertility – the “dream count” of the title refers to all missed opportunities, Adichie says. “It’s that idea of a woman wanting a life on her own terms, and the things that get in the way of that.”Incubating for some time at the back of her mind was the idea that she should write more about the “gritty reality” of women’s bodies and the obstacles to women’s lives caused by gynaecology. She saw it as demystifying the experience of, say, premenstrual dysphoric disorder. Or fibroids. Or the violence of the birthing experience. “There’s a lot that has to do with having a female body that isn’t much talked about,” she says, “and it’s consequential for women’s lives.” For a long time, she was reluctant to discuss these, fearing she – a renowned feminist – would fuel a tendency to treat things such as PMS as a joke. “Code for a woman being unreasonably irritable,” she says, darkly. But in addition to the “remarkably unpleasant experience” of having surgery for “a very big fibroid”, hormonal issues have plagued her entire life.“If one is writing honestly about women’s lives, it seems self-evident that we have to talk about these issues in a very open way, because they affect everything. They affect how well a woman does. They affect your emotional wellbeing. They get in the way of your dreams. If you’re a woman whose dream is to have a family, for example, fibroids can get in the way.” She laughs that she is not trying to raise awareness in an NHS public service announcement sort of way, but because “I was trying to write about women’s lives in a way that feels truthful and wholesome and full for me”.In a different way, arguments that raged around identity and women’s biology put Adichie in the headlines in 2017. In an interview with Channel 4 News to highlight the treatment of women, she was asked whether a transgender woman was “any less of a real woman”. She replied,“a trans woman is a trans woman”.She went on: “I think the whole problem of gender in the world is about our experiences. It’s not about how we wear our hair or whether we have a vagina or a penis. It’s about the way the world treats us, and I think if you’ve lived in the world as a man with the privileges that the world accords to men and then sort of change gender, it’s difficult for me to accept that then we can equate your experience with the experience of a woman who has lived from the beginning as a woman and who has not been accorded those privileges that men are.”Inthe consequent backlash,Adichie wrote a blogpostexpressing horror at the accusations of transphobia and reiterating her support for trans rights. But her desire for openness and frank debate (includingwith Zoe Williamsof this paper, who interviewed her after her Reith Lecture on freedom of speech in 2022) put her at odds with those whose bottom line is: no debate.There is no doubt her career was damaged. Interviews, prizes and talks were cancelled. And she cancelled interviews, too – those that suggested she might want to take the opportunity to apologise. It seemed for a while as if there were only two headlines available: “Chimamanda apologises” or “Chimamanda refuses to apologise”. “It’s a cannibalistic ethos,” she told her friend the writerDave Eggersabout sections of the progressive left at the time. “It swiftly, gleefully, brutally eats its own. There is such a quick assumption of ill will and an increasing sanctimony and humourlessness that can often seem inhumane.”Time concertinaed, the circus refused to move on. I suggest the emotional toll must have been enormous. Adichie will not talk about it. Did it hamper her creatively? She refuses to say. The closest she comes to the subject is later: “What do I want to say about cancel culture? Cancel culture is bad. We should stop it. End of story.”I ask instead about Donald Trump, about whom she has spoken and written before. She has said that Trump was as much America as Barack Obama, and that given the history of America, it was not surprising that he was popular: people felt threatened by diversity, by women having more power. Will she talk me through the highs and lows she felt during the election campaign? She opens her mouth to speak, but words quite literally fail her. She tries to rally. “In some ways, I feel the necessity of bearing witness, so … ” She pauses, then emits a sigh of defeat. “I can’t. Part of the reason I don’t want to talk about Trump is that he takes up too much space. This is what being a megalomaniac is about: taking up all the space. Sometimes, the best form of resistance is ignoring someone. More ignoring should have happened during the first term. Because even the mean girl teenager knows the best thing is not actually to say mean things to the other girl; it’s to ignore her.”Democracy is in serious trouble. I’m surprised at how willing people are to discard integrity in the name of some kind of cultI ask if she thinks democracy is in danger. From the age of about 10, she says, she had a “dark fascination” with the Nazis – “I don’t know what that says about my mental wellbeing” – and that for years she would watch films and read books and wonder in disbelief, how people could have been so swept up in such obvious hate. “Now, I see why. Sometimes it takes very little. So, do I think democracy is dead? No. Do I think it’s in serious trouble? Yes. Am I surprised? Yes. I’m surprised at how willing people are to discard integrity in the name of some kind of cult. And I think it is a cult. Cult-like loyalty.” She points to the numbers who “know better” but nonetheless stand there nodding as Trump promotes his unqualified lieutenants into positions of immense power and responsibility. “They are saying things that you know they don’t believe. It’s incredible.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Jared Soares/The Guardian“If I ever became president of a country – it sounds crazy – I think it’s possible to work slowly towards a place that is more like a utopia. It’s possible with good leadership. I’m not even like a rabid anti-capitalist, because I’m an Igbo woman. My people are traders. But the kind of capitalism we have now, we don’t need to have. What if we actually employed people, paid them well, thought about their healthcare? Gave people four-day weeks, because we know that human beings thrive better when they’re well rested?”One thing she struggles with in her daily life is finding balance amid the rapid-fire breaking news (her phone pings on cue). She remembers Trump’s first term, how they lurched from day to day, aghast: “Oh, my God, what’s happened now?” How destructive it was to creative thought. There has to be a happy medium, she says, between blanking it completely and the necessary outrage over situations such as, “They’re sending immigration officers topublic schools in Virginia. In America! It’s madness.” She adds: “America has to survive. I mean, it’d better.”Adichie is eating grapes, cheese and crackers. Her daughter comes in to nuzzle her and pinch some food. I ask what her average day looks like, and Adichie says she gets up at 6am, goes for a two-mile run, then comes back and does 30 minutes of yoga. She throws me a teasing grin. But seriously, does she go to the gym? “Gym? That’s not for me, darling.” But as she can’t just sit and watch TV without, say, reading at the same time, what she will do is run on the treadmill while viewing a French or Scandi crime thriller with subtitles. She doesn’t like American TV. “People wake up with a full face of makeup.” Also, the sex is unrealistic. “People sweeping plates off across the table dramatically or hanging off the wall in a way that you think, ‘That looks very uncomfortable.’”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

When it’s going well, it is – aside from being with the kids – all she wants to do. “There’s not a lot of patience for ordinary life. I cannot wait to get back to writing. Sometimes I don’t want to sleep because I’m terrified that if I wake up, I will have lost the flow.” So she writes in her room, her husband tiptoeing around her, in the public library and large chunks at her house in Lagos, where the family spend the school holidays. She is lucky to have help, she adds, especially in Lagos where staff leave her food outside her door, “because, God forbid, they’d knock and disturb my flow”.Writing fiction is when she is happiest. “You should talk to my husband: he would say, ‘She becomes a different person.’ It’s like a high. I don’t do drugs, but I imagine that it is that absolute high. I’m struck by how much time passes and I don’t realise. Then when I am done – whatever it is, a character that I’ve finally got – the rest of the day is joyful floating. I’m so much fun to be around. And that is not always the case.”She hears her husband in the kitchen and calls him in – “Dr Esege!” – and then introduces me. “This is the unfortunate man I married. He’s a doctor, so he has a proper job.” She asks him if he has napped this afternoon and he replies, “I had to. Your son.” “What did my son do?” she replies. In an aside to me she explains that her husband is doing nights with the boys while she deals with the carnival of book publicity. “At 3.30am, he started babbling on and on,” Esege says. “Next thing, he pulled my shirt up to bang my belly. He wouldn’t stop. He was – ” he makes a blowing noise with his lips – “I gave him milk and after about an hour he decided to go back to sleep.” Adichie laughs. “This child will not sleep through the night,” she says. I tell her my son didn’t sleep until he was 10. She waves her palm at me. “I don’t want to hear that, Charlotte, thank you.”Adichie was born in Enugu, Nigeria, in 1977, the fifth of six children. Her father James was a mathematician, her mother Grace a sociology graduate who was the first female registrar of the University of Nigeria, Nsukka. Adichie was an outdoorsy kid, playing football and badminton with her two siblings who are closest in age, as well as bookish. She read “whatever I saw”: ­Enid Blyton,Agatha Christie,Camara Laye,Chinua AchebeandFlora Nwapa. “I read books that I had no business reading. Histories of the Catholic church, because my father had those. I would have read my father’s statistics books but I didn’t know what the hell they meant.”There are many times when I was short with my mother when I didn’t need to be. There’s a tendency for girls to do that. I wish we would stopShe says hers was a life “deeply shaped” by her parents, that their deaths have left her truly changed. In this way, Dream Count is a “departure”: “The person who wrote Purple Hibiscus was young, but still the person who wrote Half of a Yellow Sun. And in some ways also the person who wrote Americanah. But today I am alone. I’m a person who looks at the world differently.” She spoke to her mother the night before she died. “She was fine; she went to mass. The next morning – my father’s birthday – she was gone. If somebody wrote that in a fiction class I was teaching, I’d be like, ‘No, this is too much.’”The time since has involved much self-reflection. There are “things I regret; positions I took”. Can she name any? She clicks her tongue. “Not even so much the position as the how.” She says she didn’t want to talk about this because she knew she would cry. “My mother and I were very close. But there are many times when I was short with her when I didn’t need to be. There’s a tendency for girls to do that with mothers. I wish we would stop. I want to tell all the girls in the world. I’m not saying, ‘Don’t express frustration.’ I’m just saying, take a step back and think, ‘Am I doing this with grace?’ Was this in her teenage years? “No, older. When I was a teenager, I was equal opportunities horrible: I felt I knew everything, that my parents knew nothing. Sometimes, I would not be patient with her. I would be patient with my father. She saw the world a lot more clearly, as women often do.View image in fullscreenStylist: Somi Nwandu of Nwanyi Oma Style Curating.

I wish I could have done better.” She finds a tissue. “Lord, why did I start saying this?” She smiles. “My mother would not read everything I wrote, but she would tell everybody that it was wonderful.”She was surprised by what a physical thing grief was, how she reacted in ways she could never have imagined – beating the ground; jumping on the spot. “If you had told me before that I would ever throw myself on the ground for anything, I would have rolled my eyes. I’m still thinking about how little I knew myself. That, I think, is really a big part of the novel: the question of, ‘Do we know ourselves? Do we know other people? Can we?’ I think for me, reasonably, the answer is ‘no’.”One night in the weeks after her mother’s death, she took to her laptop at 3am and wrote a furious essay entitledIt Is Obscene. It condemned “sanctimony” on social media, and saying some young people are “so terrified of having the wrong opinions that they have robbed themselves of the opportunity to think and to learn and to grow”. She cited, but did not name, two writers she had mentored, who later spread “falsehoods”. Traffic jammed the page and her website crashed.“I was full of rage,” she says now. I ask, given the timing, whether the piece was fuelled by grief. She stalls. “I would never have made this connection. Clearly. We buried my mother in May, I wrote this thing in June. I hate that word ‘triggered’ – but my nephew had just told me that people were saying online, ‘Oh, it’s a good thing [Adichie’s] parents died because she’s transphobic.’”Adichie says in the utopia of her dreams there will be no social media, no cancel culture. In addition to “every woman being happy and fulfilled” she’d want African Americans and Africans to have a closer connection. “I’m interested in intra-black dialogues and differences. There’s a lot of tension. And it seems to me that it’s often from not knowing enough of one another.”Many of these ideas are fleshed out in her novel, a manifesto of sorts. One character creates “Robyn Hood grants” [sic] for women to start small businesses by funnelling funds from her financially corrupt Nigerian employer. I ask if this is a fantasy and she says yes. “I’m hoping somebody will be inspired.” Elsewhere, her character writes hilarious “Dear Men, I am on your side” letters on a For Men Only advice site. Adichie says she has been known to take men to one side for a quiet word. When friends confide about their relationships, often she’ll think, “‘Do you know what? I’m going to call that man. We need to set him straight.’ No, really. And I’m not going to lie, I’ve done it a few times. Sometimes my friends are like, ‘Please don’t, because you will make things worse.’”The section of the book she describes as “very precious” is where she fictionalises the story of Nafissatou Diallo, the hotel maid from Guinea who alleged in 2011 that former IMF chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn had attempted to rape her.The case collapsedat trial after it emerged that Diallo had lied to the authorities and a grand jury about her background. Adichie wrote at the time: “I know women like Nafissatou Diallo. Women who, like me, are West African but, unlike me, do not have the privilege of education or a middle-class upbringing. On television, she was familiar: the skin tone that suggested cheap bleaching creams, the ambitious hair weave, the melodrama … Diallo comes from a place where melodrama is not unusual, and often suggests truth as much as lies.”The case, she says, never left her imagination. “I was so upset by it. I just felt that it was wrong, not just morally, but in what it said about America. The message it was sending to women claiming they have been sexually abused is: you’d better be perfect. You’d better be utterly sinless. You’d better be an angel if you expect to get justice. It’s not just about that character. It’s also about all the women who, because of the circumstances of their lives, are powerless.” She did not meet Diallo to write her character Kadiatou, but “I did a lot of research.”I ask how she feels on the cusp of publication, and she says she was glad of a warm email fromZadie Smith, who has read the book. “It was just what I needed. Zadie is a clear thinker, an honest person.” Adichie wrote back, “You made my day.” “But it made more than my day,” she says now.She continues: “I’m so grateful that I’m back to what I love most – which is writing fiction. But there’s also anxiety. It’s my book, and I’m sending this thing out into the world. I already had sleeping issues. But the night is also when my mind roams. Invariably, it roams to terror. That terror has to be part of the creative process. I’ve always had it. But this time it just feels more finely milled.”Dream Count by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie is published on 4 March by Fourth Estate at £20.

She had looked me up and down, considering my skirt suit and heels. “You have to dress modestly,” she said, “to meet theIslamic Statewomen.”It was 2019, and so far my career had revolved around mostly failed efforts to help stabiliseIraq, including attempts to influence US Iraq policy from Washington thinktanks and convening high-profile Iraqi leaders in various absurd peace processes. I had grown up half-Iraqi in the UK during the invasion of Iraq – and I felt duty-bound to help my motherland.Eventually, I became a peacebuilding consultant (yes, that’s a real job) and spent most of my time in Baghdad meeting politicians. I would urge them to embrace political inclusion as a means of preventing a resurgence of violent extremism. They would call me a terrorist sympathiser. And we’d do that dance over and over again. But I was growing tired of the lack of progress. So, when the Iraqi government suggested I focus on a new problem – the fate of IS families – I jumped at the chance.After the military defeat of IS, the fighters had been killed or imprisoned, but their families were stuck in refugee camps. The government was concerned they posed a threat and their communities didn’t want them to come home. Security services floated the idea of a “deradicalisation programme”. Could we interrogate the beliefs of IS women and make sure they were safe to release?So, the Iraqi MP and I dressed in our most modest clothes and visited a refugee camp to investigate. Camp authorities arranged for us to meet some suspected IS women. We stood for a moment outside the tent, feeling suddenly afraid. What if these women were dangerous?We walked in, the light straining through the dark plastic ceiling. Four women sat on thin foam mattresses on the floor. They wore colourful headscarves and long dresses, their blackened feet bare, plastic slippers stacked by the back entrance. Scores of children ran in and out, yelling as they played tag.“IS came to our village and took girls to marry,” said one of the women. “What could we do? We cannot say no.” She gestured towards a teenage girl, who stared at the ground, picking at her cuticles. “This one is 17, they forced her, now she has two children.”I’d spent my entire career trying to be taken seriously as one of few women working on Middle East policy. Now I was writing a novel full of sex jokesAs I looked at her, I felt silly for having been afraid. These women, like most in the Iraqi camps, were unequivocal victims. “We’re not like the foreigners,” the woman continued, “who came from outside to join IS. We had no choice.” My mind turned to the British teenage girls whohadtravelled to the Islamic State. They were now sitting in camps just across the border in Syria. Could they be considered victims? The thought triggered a deep uneasiness.As we travelled back to Baghdad, I wondered why I felt such a strong sense of discomfort. I didn’t just feel pity towards the IS women, I felt personally connected to them. That’s when it dawned on me. I’d come close to radicalism myself, and given the right circumstances, I could have ended up an IS bride.I’ve always been a bleeding-heart empath: that’s why I went into peacebuilding. But as a teenager, that same impulse could have seen me join a terrorist group. I grew up watching my mum sob over mass killings in Bosnia, did my GCSEs as the UK bombed Afghanistan, prepared for my A-levels when we invaded Iraq. Dead Muslim bodies on TV were ubiquitous, and it felt targeted and intentional. One summer, when I was 17, I studied with sheikh Anwar al-Awlaki, a charismatic Yemeni-American preacher who spoke compellingly about Muslims being under siege. I was entranced by him. A few years later, Awlaki joined al-Qaida. He never tried to recruit me, but what if he had? What if he told me I could defend innocent lives, that the terrible things I’d heard about al-Qaida were just western propaganda? I might have believed him.Instead, I went to university and my capacity for critical thinking grew and matured. I still believed in fighting injustice, I just knew al-Qaida wasn’t the right vehicle to do it. But there was another generation of teenage girls who weren’t as lucky as me. The ones who came of age watching massacres of Syrian civilians on YouTube, who were persuaded that by joining IS they could save lives.In the weeks after my camp visit, as I read the academic literature on deradicalisation, I kept imagining my teenage self as an IS bride. What would she say to me now? “You want to brainwash your people to make western war criminals feel safer in their beds?”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

She saw the absurdity of my work in the international aid industry, the daily compromises to my integrity, the types of people I had to suck up to – and she told me the unvarnished truth. She reminded me of how far I’d strayed from my ideals. But in her words I also heard inexperience, youth and naivety, and my heart broke for her. She’d taken the wrong fork in the road, all her well-meaning passion squandered on that catastrophic choice.As we conversed, a 35-year-old peacebuilding practitioner and an imaginary 15-year-old, we covered rich ground. The dislocation we’d felt as second-generation British Muslims, the struggles we’d had connecting to our parents, the friendships we’d used to fill the resulting void. We argued about religion, politics, international institutions, sexuality, women’s liberation and the roles we wanted to inhabit.But what surprised me most about those conversations was how much they made me laugh. There’s something hilarious about a person who says things you’d never dare say, who sees you for exactly who you are. She was witty, precocious and unafraid – unbound by the strictures and expectations of educated, middle-class Britain.That’s when I knew I had a novel. It felt precious, this spark of joy I’d found in what could’ve been the bleakest of subjects, and I resolved to cultivate it. So, I took a standup comedy course. I wrote down everything from my religious youth, my peacebuilding career, my time in Baghdad, and tested it out on my class. Whenever they laughed, I’d take note.If I was going to write about IS brides, it had to be laugh-out-loud funny, it had to earn its place on a reader’s nightstand. That’s how I would reach the widest audience. The fate of British IS brides is a national debate, but few people have access to the reality of that experience, and there’s so little understanding of its emotional truth. Through an entertaining, plot-driven, page-turner of a novel, I could make it possible for all types of readers to engage.It was a huge risk. I’d spent my entire career trying to be taken seriously as one of few women working on Middle East policy. I’d done a PhD, gone to Oxford and Harvard, published extremely sober papers and articles, spoken at endless dreary conferences. Now I was writing a novel full of sex jokes. But when the plans for a deradicalisation programme in Iraq collapsed, and the foreign IS brides remained stuck in camps in Syria, and the policy debates grew vitriolic and reductive – I knew I had to take the leap.

If you look at a writer’s work and you see that many titles you think, ‘Well, it can’t be very serious work.’ But that’s what happened.”The seriousness of Tyler’s fiction, which includes much-loved novels Dinner at the Homesick Restaurant, The Accidental Tourist and the Pulitzer prize-winning Breathing Lessons, has bothered critics for decades. How could a writer of such witty, warm, kind novels about middle-class families that contain very little historical context, no politics or sex, even, really be one of America’s finest living novelists, as so many have claimed? Not to mention her prodigiousness. The author herself couldn’t give two hoots. Unswayed by literary fashion or criticism, she has been writing the novels that interest her, and her devoted readership, for 60 years. “How we handle day-to-day life as we go through it, with its disappointments and its pleasures, that’s all I want to know,” she says.Now 83, Tyler is on a video call from her Quaker retirement community just outside Baltimore. It is where her parents retired, and by chance, she moved into the house next door a couple of years ago. (She grew up in a Quaker commune in the mountains of North Carolina but describes herself as “a secular Quaker”.) She is framed by a large window that looks out on to trees, white walls and high eaves. “I like to say there are more deer here than people,” she jokes of her rural surroundings. “And I don’t feel any older living here than I did before.” For many years she lived in the Roland Park neighbourhood of Baltimore, where, as Tyler fans will know, most of those 25 novels are set.It is 10am there, and she has just seen off her old college roommate, who stayed over the night before. Neat as a pin in a slim grey polo-neck, she looks the same as when we last met 13 years ago, except that her trademark silver fringe is now white. Then, it was a sunny afternoon in Kensington, west London, and herfirst face-to-face interviewin 40 years. Her reluctance to do publicity meant she was often referred to as aJD Salinger-like recluse and on one occasion “the Greta Garbo of the literary world”. Yet it is hard to imagine anyone less prickly than Tyler, who talks with the softest southern accent and smiles with her whole face. She isn’t as “allergic” to interviews as she used to be (and even agreed toDesert Island Discsa couple of years ago), but she still finds them a bit of a pain: “If I talk about writing, I can’t do any writing for some time afterward. I’m too self-conscious,” she explains. “I think I’m shy, to be honest. I hate to admit it as a grownup, but there we are.”She is so unassuming, some of her friends don’t even know she is a writer. When she downsized, she didn’t keep a copy of any of her own books. “What would I do with them?” She has them all on a Kindle, but only so she can check if she’s repeating herself. Both her daughters are artists, and now she has so little wall space, it is reserved only for their work. She even got rid of most of her kitchen utensils. “There’s no clutter in my house!” she declares, proudly.View image in fullscreen‘I’ll write down a single word and use it 40 years later’ … Anne Tyler.Photograph: André ChungOne possession that was never in danger of being culled was Tyler’s index card box of ideas: sometimes the outline for whole stories, but mostly just a few words, snatches of conversation. “I’ll write down a single word and use it 40 years later,” she explains. It started out as a royal-blue recipe tin, and when that became overstuffed she upgraded to a bigger, black‑and-white index box and wrote “Blue Box” on the label (a detail that might have come from one of her novels). Before beginning a new book, she takes a dozen or so cards and sees if any of them spark something. It was to the Blue Box she turned for Three Days in June.At only 176 pages, the novel is set in Baltimore (naturally) over the three days of the wedding of Debbie Baines, but deftly expands to tell the story of her parents’ failed marriage. Gail Baines is 61 years old and has recently been let go from her job as assistant headteacher because she “lacks people skills”. She likes ironing, cuts her own hair and still has an answering machine because there are too many people she might not feel like talking to. Her ex-husband, Max, is scruffy, unpredictable, “a good man”, the author says affectionately, one of Tyler’s endearingly hapless male characters. “Boundaries; that was his problem. He lacked boundaries. I myself was all about boundaries,” Gail observes. (She might be friends with Elizabeth Strout’s more outspokenOlive Kitteridgeup in Maine, although they’d be sure to get on each other’s nerves.) The day before their daughter’s wedding, Max turns up on her doorstep with a stray cat.The idea on the index card was along the lines of the famous Sex and the City quote “find someone to love the you you love”, and it is one that she has used before, she admits unapologetically. “There are certain people who bring out the best in us and the worst,” she says. “And it’s wise to marry somebody who brings out the best.”Everything I write is about trying to lead a life other than my ownThe general theme of her cards is “‘What would it be like to be that person over there?’” she says. “Everything I write is about trying to lead a life other than my own.” But when she looks back on all her work, she is puzzled that she stayed so close to home. “Why didn’t I write about somebody who went off to climb Everest?” she asks herself. “I don’t know, but that doesn’t interest me so much.”As she says, all her novels are domestic, which has led to accusations of sentimentality and blandness.One reviewcalled her books “milk and cookies” in contrast to “the astonishing display of piss and vinegar” in Philip Roth. The comparison rings true, Tyler said back in 2012. But there’s clearly some old-fashioned sexism at work: when Updike (one of Tyler’s earliest champions) writes about married life he is “giving the mundane its beautiful due”, as he put it. Yet, arguably, Tyler’s work has endured better than some of those Big American Males, whose novels now leave a slightly bitter taste. “I used to just devour every word of Roth and Updike, and still think very highly of them,” she says. “But as you mentioned their names, I had a slight sense of … Oh, those were the smart alec guys, you know.”At its best, Tyler’s work is bittersweet rather than saccharine: when she writes about families, she is writing about how they stay together, “how they grate along”. “I wondered why it was that I had so many irritating people in my life,” Gail muses in the new novel. Tyler’s true subject is endurance, “the most moving quality of human beings”, she says.She attributes hermany sympathetic male charactersto having been “unusually lucky” in being surrounded by decent men growing up: an “amazing father” and three younger brothers (later she would add a “wonderful husband” to the list). Her mother, a social worker, was “difficult”, given to mood swings and unpredictable rages; one of her brothers would check round her bedroom door in the morning to see what sort of day it might be (Tyler now thinks she might have been bi-polar). But she was determined her children would love books. Tyler often credits her early years on the commune with giving her a novelist’s outsider slant on the world.When she was 11, the family moved to Raleigh, North Carolina, and Tyler attended a proper school for the first time. She won a scholarship to Duke University at 16, where she majored in Russian (the most rebellious thing she could do at the time) and attended creative writing classes taught by the poet and writer Reynolds Price. He immediately recognised her talent and inadvertently influenced some of her most celebrated novels by proclaiming that men can write about women, but women can’t write about men: “I thought, well, I’ll show you, Reynolds!” After a year at Columbia, New York, she returned to Duke to work as a Russian bibliographer in the library, where she met her husband Taghi Modarressi, an Iranian refugee and child psychiatrist, 10 years her senior.They were married for 34 years until, in 1997, Tyler suffered a year of personal losses and challenges that she would never inflict on any of her characters. Modarressi died of lymphoma aged 65, and months later Tyler was diagnosed with breast cancer. While she was waiting for surgery her eldest daughter was operated on for a brain tumour. And yet there was still no break in the novels.View image in fullscreenWhile death and grief have always been present in her fiction, they are most directly addressed in The Beginner’s Goodbye, published in 2012. Usually, she says, she writes about “life stages”, rather than major life events.Her first novel, If Morning Ever Comes, came out in 1964, when she was 22. After the birth of her two daughters, Tezh and Mitra, she published a new novel every two or three years. If it were possible to round up and destroy her first four novels, she would: she used to believe editing destroyed a novel’s spontaneity – she now revises “endlessly”.It was a run of novels in the early 80s that really made her name, in particularDinner at the Homesick Restaurant, written when she was 40. The story of a dying matriarch and her three differently unhappy middle-aged offspring, the novel was written during “the difficult teenage years” of bringing up her own daughters. “I was escaping into a novel. I would sit there and then get lost in it,” she says now. “I don’t think it’s my best, but it was the one that was ripped from my heart to be put on the page. And you can’t say that about most books.” Her mother didn’t speak to her for a year and a half after it was published.She thinksA Spool of Blue Threadis her best. Another family saga looking back at how the parents went wrong, it was shortlisted for both the Booker and the Women’s prize in 2015. “It maybe had fewer mistakes in it than Dinner at the Homesick Restaurant. It was a more finished, well-constructed book,” she says. For all the acclaim of those earlier novels, she believes she is a better writer now, trusting both her characters and her readers more.View image in fullscreenLike many of her characters, Tyler is a creature of habit. Each day begins with a walk before she sits at her desk with her pen and paper: “Sometimes it’s plodding, sometimes it flows.” Then follows a meticulous process of typing up the manuscript in tiny sections, rewriting it again, reading it aloud and recording it, so she can listen to it while looking at it on screen to check for any false notes or mistakes. “It’s so complicated, but it keeps me busy,” she says. If she gets stuck, she copies out the last two pages she wrote the day before, “and because it’s so slow to write things by hand, I’ll suddenly hit a word and say, ‘There’s where you went wrong. You just had that woman say something that she would never say.’ So I rewrite it, and suddenly I’m on track again.”She is “very pernickety” about her stationery and only ever used a Parker fountain pen, but had to wear plasters to stop her fingers getting covered in ink. One Christmas a Japanese reader sent her a beautifully wrapped box with every imaginable brand of pen in it, she says. “And one of them was very, very fine, black, and didn’t scrape on the paper at all.” She now orders them by the dozen online. Reader, it is a Uni-ball Signo. “I think that’s the only thing that’s changed since we last spoke,” she says, drolly.She is already at work on her next novel, which begins in the summer of last year. Tyler is famed for her Austen-like aversion to including references to external events. The Iraq war and Hillary Clinton are namechecked in The Beginner’s Goodbye, and the 2006Digging to Americagently addresses racial assimilation, but that’s about it.“I don’t approve of novels mentioning actual issues and going on and on about politics,” she says. “I’ve never had any urge to put politics in a novel or to even mention that it exists.” But recent events have been too momentous to ignore. “It seemed so wrong to have any character going about normal life after that horrendous election,” she says. “I am worried and anxious and depressed and everything you can be. This is such an extreme, horrifying thing to happen. I always trusted our constitution.”Tyler always prefers a happy ending, and if anyone can put a consoling spin on the US crisis it’s her. She would like never to finish this book, just to keep on revising and revising and not have to worry about the noise of publication, she says. But she has said that before and another five novels followed.She has “absolutely no fear” of death, rather of living too long. But it does annoy her that there might be unused index cards in the Blue Box. Maybe it stems from her horror of clutter.In the tradition of the best realist fiction, her novels make you want to do better, to be kinder – if that doesn’t sound too sugary. Does she feel a moral imperative as a novelist?“No,” she replies, emphatically. “It’s just that over and over again I am really struck by how ordinary people get through their day. Sometimes it almost strikes me as a sort of miracle. The mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation. People don’t have a lot to hope for in average lives and yet they make do, and on the whole they behave, they behave very well. That is pretty amazing.”Three Days in June by Anne Tyler is published by Chatto & Windus (£14.99). To support the Guardian and Observer, order your copy atguardianbookshop.com.

He enrolled in a drama group at the Battersea Arts Centre aged 14 and later attended London’s Identity School of Acting. He was shortlisted for outstanding newcomer at the 2011 Evening Standard theatre awards, forMogadishu. On TV he has appeared in the 2016 remake ofRoots,Black Mirror, and as Darcus Howe in Steve McQueen’sMangrove; his film work includesBoiling PointandWicked Little Letters. Kirby, who lives on the outskirts of London, stars as Hezekiah Moscow in the Disney+ seriesA Thousand Blows, set in the world of illegal boxing in the Victorian East End. It starts on 21 February.1.HobbyHorse ridingView image in fullscreenMalachi Kirby in Roots.Photograph: History ChannelI started horse riding in 2015 when I was filmingRootsand it was a crash course for sure. They had me riding bareback by the second lesson. It was exciting and terrifying, but I fell in love with horses very quickly and it brought me a lot of peace. I’ve wanted to go back to it ever since, so I’ve just started riding again and taking it much slower this time – even though I’ve cantered and ridden bareback in the past, I haven’t actually gotten past trotting yet, but I’m really enjoying it.2.RestaurantThe Black Kitchen,London SW16View image in fullscreenChef Lati of the Black Kitchen, with a secret patty.Photograph: instagram.com/theblackkitchenldnA friend was telling me about this place in Balham that has incredible Jamaican patties, which are one of my favourite things to eat. These ones are called secret patties, which made my guard go up: like, what’s the secret? Why can’t you tell me? Apparently it’s got oxtail and mac’n’cheese in it, which is something I’d never considered, but it’s an incredible idea. I don’t know if I can eat a patty the same way again now. The restaurant is moving to a bigger place in Streatham and I’m excited to see what other secrets they’ve got on their menu.3.FilmHard Truths(dirMike Leigh)View image in fullscreenMarianne Jean-Baptiste, left, and Michele Austin in Hard Truths.Photograph: Simon Mein/API went to see this with my mum the other day. Mike Leigh is one of her favourite directors, and watching this one made me realise what she loves about him. He has a very distinctive style and a way of letting moments breathe, and I love that. Marianne Jean-Baptiste is incredible as a woman who’s angry at the world. Her performance confused me at first, I wasn’t sure if I was supposed to be laughing or feeling heartbroken, but then there’s a moment where it all starts to make sense. Leigh manages to capture everyday life in a way that makes the ordinary extraordinary.4.TVLessons in Chemistry(Apple TV+)View image in fullscreenBrie Larson and Gus the goldendoodle in Lessons in Chemistry.Photograph: Landmark Media/AlamyI’m on the last episode of this show and honestly it’s one of my favourite things right now. Brie Larson plays a brilliant scientist in 1950s America who isn’t respected in her lab, so she brings her chemistry skills to cooking instead and ends up hosting a cookery show on TV. Essentially it’s about a woman who, through remaining integral to who she is, changes the environment she lives in and the way that things are done in that time. I’ve been cooking a lot this year, so the show has inspired me in that regard as well.5.PlaceSouth Bank, London SE1View image in fullscreenThe Royal Festival Hall at South Bank, London.Photograph: CAMimage/AlamyOne of my favourite places in the world, especially in the summer. In my late teens I started going there to write, and I remember being taken aback because there would be dancers with boomboxes and people in suits having business meetings, and no one was looking down their nose at anyone. Everyone could fill the space without apologising for their existence. Also, it was the one public place that I was able to go and take a nap without getting [moved on]. I wish more of the world was like that.6.TheatreRetrograde(Apollo theatre, London W1, from 8 March)View image in fullscreenIvanno Jeremiah as Sidney Poitier with Stanley Townsend, left, and Oliver Johnstone in Retrograde.Photograph: Hugo GlendinningI saw this play at the Kiln last year and I’m really looking forward to seeing it on a bigger stage when ittransfers to the West Endnext month. It’s about the actor Sidney Poitier and it focuses on a single conversation that changed his career – he comes out of it completely transformed. I think Ryan Calais Cameron is one of the most exciting writers of this generation and Ivanno Jeremiah is brilliant as Poitier. It’s one of those plays that speaks to right now. I wouldn’t be surprised if it gets turned into a film or a TV series.Explore more on these topicsCultureOn my radarRestaurantsHorsesTheatreFoodTelevisionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

In the case of John Hughes’ ur-teen-flickThe Breakfast Club, still bratty four decades after its zeitgeist-capturing theatrical run, its headlining truth that teenagers possess depth beyond their broad archetypes has since been re-realized ad nauseam by generations of on-screen adolescents. (Smaller, ancillary truths, such as the binding potential of cannabis to bridge inter-clique divides, are where the film really shines.) Of recent vintage, high school crowd-pleasers Booksmart and Bottoms both learned the hard way that the pretty, popular girls descended from Molly Ringwald’s princess in pink Claire face private challenges belied by their put-together exterior. Arguably, grasping that other people exist just as much as you do is the defining milestone of the puberty years, but it still behooves a present-day viewer of Hughes’ film to remind themselves that he first broke ground on what has come to seem matter-of-fact.The Stepford Wives at 50: a compelling idea in search of a better movieRead moreHughes’ unvarnished take on youth culture, replete with joints and F-bombs, arrived in 1985 to fill a vacuum of movies about young people in which they could see lifelike facsimiles of themselves. To one side, they had the risible attempts from much-mocked after-school specials to address Big Issues, and to the other, the cartoonish raunch of Porky’s and its hairy-palmed ilk. Following through logically on the anti-nostalgic purview of Hughes’ tenure at National Lampoon, where he punctured Rockwell’s wholesome Americana to find a waking hell in the ritual of family vacation, The Breakfast Club dared to admit that everything sucks. (In this stance, it announces itself as one of the earliest gen X touchstones.) And while that sentiment’s accuracy hasn’t been diminished by time – teens have no money, they live with their parents, their sense of self is a whirling cyclone of chaos – its articulation has.Taken up most prominently by Ringwald herself in a2018 essayfor the New Yorker, the reassessment effort challenging the film’s widely beloved standing has focused on a political coarseness pronounced by the present’s rising tides of sensitivity. At the height of the #MeToo reckonings, Ringwald reframed her character’s dynamic with Judd Nelson’s bad boy, John Bender, as a constant campaign of sexual harassment rather than mere flirting, of a piece with a nasty reactionary streak in Hughes’ work also present in the F-slur spray-painted on a locker in the film’s opening minutes.As for the casual homophobia, Hughes is guilty of honestly reflecting the cruelty of children in their time (and, as suggested by the new television seriesEnglish Teacher, ours). The relationship between Claire and Bender can’t be so easily condemned, either; as teens have done since time immemorial, they’ve channeled their begrudging attraction to one another into bickering, junior counterparts to the small screen’s Sam and Diane. His line-crossing crassness is essential to his appeal, as my wife heartily affirmed from across the couch during our rewatch. And though the memorable set piece in which Bender jams his head between Claire’s thighs while hiding under a table represents an unsavory overplaying of his hand, it pales in comparison to the racial caricature of Long Duk Dong, or the lecherous whole of Weird Science.The faults of The Breakfast Club are less pungently offensive and more pedestrian, a matter of simple misjudgment rather than shifting social mores. The twin successes of Hughes’ screenplays for National Lampoon’s Vacation and Mr Mom had earned him golden-boy status at Universal in 1983, and the resultant three-picture deal that launched his directorial career also imbued him with newfound sureness in his voice. Inhis essayfor the Criterion Collection’s reputation-shoring home-video release of The Breakfast Club, writer David Kamp echoes Ringwald’s likening of the character-driven, single-location plot to black box theatre, but the comparison rings truest in the overdetermined, schematic parceling-out of information. The much-lauded scene in which the detention-dwellers share their formative traumas has far more in common with the after-school specials at which the film thumbed its nose than Hughes cared to admit, the broaching of subjects like suicide and parental abuse played in the all-caps register that clear descendant Freaks and Geeks always sagely avoided. Many of the treasured soundbites – “We’re all pretty bizarre. Some of us are just better at hiding it,” being the main offender – pass off doodle-able platitudes as wisdom. (Not to mention the false equivalency about everyone coping with their own struggles when it’s obvious that Bender’s life is materially, demonstrably worse than his peers’.)Still, the character who gets the rawest deal would have to be Allison, the “basket case” played by Ally Sheedy; while the rest of the gang bare their inner dysfunctions, she reveals that she’s nowhere near as tormented as she appears, her theft and compulsive lying products of being bored and unstimulated. The makeover she gratefully receives from glamour girl Claire in order to win a kiss from Emilio Estevez’s jock Andrew betrays her character in every way, suggesting that her identity was only ever a problem to be solved with conformity to the dullest, drabbest mold. The prescriptive Reagan-era notion of normalcy is of a piece with an overall conservative streak in the final minutes, sold via the anthemic uplift of Simple Minds’ Don’t You (Forget About Me), all triumphant swells diametrically at odds with the aspirations to emotional realism. The boy gets the girl, the girl gets the boy, the dweeb finds his inner man, Bender pumps his fist in victory.This ostensible paean to the nobility of the losers ends by making them all winners; the film lauded for telling it like it really is wraps up with comforting Hollywood artifice. Modern-day slumber parties watch The Breakfast Club as fantasy, a return to a simpler time of teased-out hair and landline phones, but its appeal – that showing the ways we are broken to someone we can trust will heal both of you – has always hinged on escapism.Explore more on these topicsThe Breakfast ClubJohn HughesComedy filmsComedyTeen moviesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But in fact, perhaps more than any other form of animation, stop-motion is a medium that lends itself to darker, more violent themes: the macabre sentient tendrils of Jan Svankmajer’sLittle Otik; the haunted gothic fairytales dreamed up in the imagination of Tim Burton; the chilling pre-teen horror ofCoraline. Add to this list the singular vision of Australian stop-motion animator Adam Elliot (Mary and Max;the Oscar-winning shortHarvie Krumpet), whose tragicomic tales of loneliness, eccentricity and outsider status are told in a glum colour palette that evokes black mould, peeling wallpaper and crushed dreams.Elliot’s latest, the multi-award-winning, Oscar-nominatedMemoir of a Snail,is the sorry tale of a melancholic woman named Grace Pudel, voiced with world-weary resignation bySuccession’sSarah Snook. It’s a catalogue of misfortune: Grace’s mother dies in childbirth; she and her twin brother, Gilbert (Kodi Smit-McPhee), are orphaned when their depressive, alcoholic father succumbs to his sleep apnoea. And then things getreallybad. Grace, like the pet snails she counts among her closest friends, just wants to crawl into her shell and hide from the world.It’s bleak, certainly. But what makes this a distinctively Elliot film is not the relentless misfortune but the flashes of mordant humour to be found alongside Grace’s hoarded knick-knacks, and the care with which the director handles his damaged, cherished social outcasts.In UK and Irish cinemasWatch a trailer for Memoir of a Snail.Explore more on these topicsAnimation in filmThe ObserverSarah SnookEric BanareviewsShareReuse this content"

But this seems like an unfinished sketch for something that perhaps needed more development at the script stage.Adranic Manet plays Ari, a highly-strung, sensitive, shiftless guy who in his late 20s is still living with his hard-working widowed dad and can’t settle down to anything. He appears to have dumped his girlfriend in circumstances which reflect very badly on him. Ari has recently flunked out of his latest attempt at gainful employment — as a primary school teacher — and when his dad finally throws him for his own good, Ari goes around talking to (and crashing with) a number of his old acquaintances, and finally makes contact with his ex-girlfriend Irène (Clémence Coullon).The very beginning of the film is the best part, but also the most baffling. We see hopeless, hapless Ari, the trainee infant-school teacher, trying to interest his class of boisterous little kids in a complex poem he attempts to read aloud to them — under the eye of his exasperated instructor. Does Ari think he is addressing a graduate seminar? These are little kids, who are utterly uninterested. Poor Ari, under pressure, faints in front of the class. It is a hilarious moment, showing how hilariously — poignantly — useless Ari is at the job. It is after he quits that his dad throws him out.But wait. Some other scenes, presumably flashbacks, show Ari being absolutely brilliant at the job: he has natural gentleness and creativity and instinctive awareness of what children want. The little kids love him. So what was going on?It’s not clear. But what is clear that the subject of children is very important to Ari. Later we see Ari trying to reconnect with an old female friend who is pretty highly strung herself, and a male friend who is rich, obnoxious and careerist. Both these encounters feel like actors’ improv classes — and then the obnoxious rich guy, evidently remorseful at how mean he’d been to poor Ari, simply gives him the key to his flat by the sea, with an offer to stay there as long as he likes, an improbably generous gesture which is there to facilitate later scenes which themselves neither tie anything up nor leave them interestingly untied. Serraille is a hugely talented film-maker but this isn’t her best work.Explore more on these topicsBerlin film festivalWorld cinemaTeachingFestivalsreviewsShareReuse this content"

Elsewhere, knockout Wagner on a shoestringFiona MaddocksSat 15 Feb 2025 08.00 ESTShareIn the feverish build up toFesten, Mark-Anthony Turnage’snew operato a libretto by Lee Hall, one question has dominated. Why make an opera based on Thomas Vinterberg’scult 1998 film, in which a son accuses his father of child abuse? The implication: why not think of something new. Since nearly the entire operatic repertoire, from Monteverdi’sL’Orfeo(1607) to Puccini’sToscaonward, is based on extant sources – myth, plays, novels and, now it exists, cinema – the question should hardly detain us, beyond initial acknowledgment. Opera needs stories that can be sung.Festen, as well as being a dark exploration of human frailty, offers the potential for arias, choruses, crowd scenes, intimate duets, orchestral interludes: the stuff of opera. The result, which finds Turnage (b.1960) at the peak of his powers, is a dazzling and jubilantly entertaining work. It was premiered last Tuesday by the RoyalOpera, conducted by Edward Gardner, directed by Richard Jones and designed by Miriam Buether, with a flawless cast, orchestra and chorus.Turnage’s first opera wasGreek(1988), a prodigious early work based (via Sophocles, and Steven Berkoff’s play) onOedipus Rexupdated to the Thatcher era, as aggressive and affecting now as when new.The Silver Tassie(2000),Anna Nicole(2011) andCoraline(2018) followed. A composer loyal to his collaborators, he is back working with some of the same team. Richard Jones directedAnna Nicole, about the AmericanPlayboymodel, in a production memorable for pneumatic breasts and much pink. Gerald Finley sang the lead inThe Silver Tassie, adapted from Sean O’Casey’s anti-war play.Characters are given definition by instrumental colour – Helge by a torpid sludge of tuba and trombonesNow Finley is Helge, the father celebrating his 60th birthday with friends and family. The large cast consists of many singers who, directly or not, have accompanied Turnage throughout his working life. Centre stage was John Tomlinson. As the baffled grandfather he sings only a line or two, but with his years of experience became the paternal linchpin of a collective enterprise. Star singers took their bows together, as part of the company:Allan Claytonas Christian, raped by his father in childhood and still blank with trauma; Stéphane Degout as the younger son, Michael, who moves through life with the grace of a demolition ball; Natalya Romaniw as Helena, the daughter attempting to make family peace through a haze of drug addiction. Among the long list of names to mention: Susan Bickley, Philippa Boyle, Clare Presland, Peter Brathwaite.Set in a 1980s-style hotel that switched between reception, bedroom, kitchen and dining room, helped by Lucy Carter’s lighting effects, Buether’s sets are stylish and efficient. Action is swift-moving. This makes the impact all the more devastating.Festen, in the hands of Turnage, Hall (credits include the screenplay forBilly Elliot) and Jones, is often funny. Comedy whets the tragedy. Hall’s nimble, demotic text bristles with internal rhyme. An opening “hello” chorus, a hideous, racist rendition of Baa Baa, Black Sheep and, as a centrepiece, a conga support a strong dramatic structure.View image in fullscreen‘Comedy whets the tragedy’: Gerald Finley (Helge), Rosie Aldridge (Else), centre, and company in Festen.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/the GuardianAbove all, Turnage’s score, confidently played by the Royal Opera orchestra under Gardner, has assurance, noisy ebullience and lyrical intensity. An army of percussion instruments – whip, ratchet, castanets, maracas, edgy and scratchy in mood – is softened by marimba, harp, piano and celesta. Rumbles of bass clarinets and contrabassoons lurk beneath sparky top lines. Characters are given definition by instrumental colour: Helmut (Thomas Oliemans), the unlucky master of ceremonies, is accompanied by strident high brass; Helge by a torpid sludge of tuba and trombones. Silence, the white space between sounds, is employed to arrest and shock.‘It’s really a very dark comedy’: Festen, the explosive opera based on the dinner-party-from-hell filmRead moreTurnage has always owed much to jazz, but here the echoes of Britten (the choruses ofPeter Grimes) and Tippett (the dances fromThe Midsummer Marriage), as well as the precision and transparency of his teacher, the composerOliver Knussen, show Turnage embracing, rather than shying away from, a vital lineage. Opera can be more palpably avant garde, no doubt. In the myriad alliances the art form requires, of music, words, staging, every decision is an extreme experiment. Failure is a norm. This one works. Daring and brilliantly achieved,Festenis the composer’s best work yet.The lure of Wagner’sRing, especially in the UK, remains irrevocable if not mysterious. Devotees flocked to Gloucestershire last summer forLongborough Opera’s cycle. One couple, dressed as the god Wotan and his Valkyrie daughter Brünnhilde (unless horned helmets are their normal attire), had travelled from the US. Last Sunday, identifiable Wagnerians – you learn to recognise the markings – wandered up and down in freezing rain, waiting for the doors of York Hall in Bethnal Green, east London, to open. Famous as a boxing venue, this is the new home forRegents Opera’s in-the-roundRingcycle, built up, with minimal budget, over the past five years.The conductor Ben Woodward has arranged the score for 22 instruments, including electric organ. Initially it sounded underpowered, with rough edges, but my ears grew accustomed. Caroline Staunton’s production, with designs by Isabella Van Braeckel, takes place on a small stage. Costumes are eclectic, from folkloric tunic-tabard (Ralf Lukas as the conflicted Wotan) to rocker tight trousers (James Schouten, a wily, hip-swivelling Loge). The set is a group of different sized plinths, prone to thudding to the ground when the action speeds up.View image in fullscreenRhinemaidens Jillian Finnamore, Mae Heydorn and Justine Viani with Oliver Gibbs as Alberich in Regents Opera’s Das Rheingold.Photograph: Matthew CoughlanThe graft needed to bring off two complete cycles in this way (the first ends tomorrow; the second starts next Sunday) is incalculable.Das Rheingold, first of the four operas, had some admirable performers: the Rhinemaidens (Jillian Finnamore, Justine Viani and, also singing Erda, Mae Heydorn), Ingeborg Novrup Børch as an incensed Fricka, Charlotte Richardson’s gleaming Freia. As her brother Froh, god of spring and the only half-decent character in the whole of theRing, Calvin Lee perilously cartwheeled on stage and sang his high phrases with exuberant charm. Then he summoned up the rainbow bridge and it was all over. I doubt the cheers when Tyson Fury beat Rich Power at York Hall were much louder than those that erupted once those rotten, gold-greedy gods had crossed to Valhalla.Star ratings (out of five)Festen★★★★★Das Rheingold★★★★Festenis at the Royal Opera House, London, until 27 February and will be broadcast on Radio 3/BBC Sounds on 22 MarchRegents Opera’sRing(cycle 1)at York Hall, London, ends withGötterdämmerung, Sunday 16 February, 3pm; cycle 2 dates:Das Rheingold(23 February);Die Walküre, (25 February);Siegfried(27 February);Götterdämmerung(2 March)Explore more on these topicsOperaThe ObserverRoyal Opera HouseMark-Anthony TurnagereviewsShareReuse this content"

Or we think we do. There can only be one finale to Cyndi Lauper’s farewell tour set, soundtracking the streamer explosions garlanding a sea of upheld phones –Girls Just Want to Have Fun, a female-forward anthem from 1983 that hasn’t left hits radio playlists since.Originally written byRobert Hazard, the song was refashioned by Lauper into a paean to women’s pleasure and freedom. It staked a claim to living life in brightly hued contrast to the lives her mother, her aunts, their female neighbours in Queens, New York – and many of their Sicilian foremothers – had put up with. The dancers in the video intentionally featured a range of ethnicities, the conga line dragged in a diverse array of party people and passersby. Everyone wanted fun, the track screamed. Everyone deserved choice and autonomy over how they spent their time.Tonight, Girls Just Want to Have Fun does yet more uplifting, managing to fulfil its cheery remit while throwing in even more substance. Giant red and white polka dots dominate the visuals, from the video screens to the band’s outfits, in tribute toYayoi Kusama. A fellow colourful outlier from the art world, she isone of a handful of visual artistswoven into the tour’s fabric.Lauper explains how for years Kusama was misunderstood. (She had mounted a protest installation outside the Venice Biennale in 1966, and was finally chosen to represent Japan there many years later.) As the track unfurls, fellow outrageous dresser Boy George turns up to duet with Lauper. The night ends far less like an I Heart the 80s revue, however, than a rally. “Girls just want to have their fundamental rights!” yells Lauper. “Everyone wants to have their fundamental rights!” The crowd chant it back at her. Lurid-coloured wigs on sale tonight support herwomen’s reproductive health care fundof the same name.Lauper chatting – throwing off her wig, clambering into yet another get-up – is just as compelling as her holding a noteA night with theGrammy, Emmy and Tony award-winning singer, then, is about far more than just a nostalgic romp through the hits. There are anecdotes about her theatre productions (a stage musical ofWorking Girlis due in the UK hopefully in 2027, she says). There’s a particularly funny fourth wall-breaking costume change broadcast from backstage, where wigs and wardrobe assail Lauper as she tries to talk about accidentally killing a goldfish. Someone offers her sushi.The tunes everyone knows from her debut album, 1983’sShe’s So Unusual, and its follow-up,True Colors(1986), are here, of course – sung in a lower register than in the 80s, but powerful nonetheless. The set kicks off with another hit:She Bop, Lauper’s playful ode to masturbation. That video also featured staunchly Catholicmum and aunties, who only found out the true nature of the “danger zone” that she was “messing with” afterwards.Soon,When You Were Minearrives – a Prince cover that she made her own. Lauper kept the pronouns as they were written, effectively singing about the breakdown of a queer throuple in long-ago 1983 (“I never was the kind to make a fuss,” the song goes, “when he was there, sleeping in between the two of us”).Near the end,True Colors– a song of consolation that became an LGBTQ+ anthem – finds Lauper dancing with a giant airborne rainbow-coloured scarf on a B-stage, an adapted “air fountain” work by the installation artistDaniel Wurtzel. “They can write diversity out of the books but they can’t write it out of what we are,” she concludes tonight. Again, Lauper has turned words to activism.True Colors United, co-founded in 2008 by the singer, tackles homelessness among queer youth.Watch Cyndi Lauper perform True Colors live.Refreshingly, at such notionally slick and sanitised arena scale, there is human error tonight too. Lauper forgets to do a song. She is clearly mortified. She gets so involved telling us things – how one chapter in your life does not define you, how she sought therapy because she fell in love with a man called David after having ended a long relationship with her former manager, also named David – that she misses her Wanda Jackson cover, Funnel of Love.But Lauper chatting – throwing off her wig, clambering into yet another get-up – is just as compelling as her holding a note. The preamble to one of her lesser-known outings,Sally’s Pigeons, explains how the song is about a young friend who died after a backstreet abortion. She underlines that in parts of the US now, women no longer have the autonomy over their own bodies that men have. “I never thought at this age I’d be fighting, again, for these freedoms,” she notes.Her energy for the fight, and much else, remains reassuringly high, even if she is bowing out of performing gigs. Towards the end, during Money Changes Everything, she writhes around on the ground, fanned with a towel by one of her longtime backing singers. She delivers many of her songs with a swagger tonight, often singing just behind the beat, working to her own rhythm. After all, as one of her hits,Time After Time, puts it, “the drum beats out of time” – not Lauper.Explore more on these topicsCyndi LauperKitty Empire's artist of the weekPop and rockreviewsShareReuse this content"

For Finnish archaeology student Laura (Seidi Haarla), it begins with sharing a compartment with ostensibly boorish young Russian Lyokha (Anora’s Yura Borisov), but this brief encounter leads her into a realisation of the lives of others and an opportunity to re-evaluate her own.

But nothing beats exploring its historic neighbourhoods on footColin O’BrienSat 15 Feb 2025 02.00 ESTShareThis warren of narrow streets, some so tight that only the noon sunshine penetrates all the way down to the cobbles, is part gothic, part romanesque, and all beautiful. It’s blessed with an embarrassment of architectural riches and wrapped up in wonderfully preserved medieval walls that hug the city tightly, an enchantingly compact tangle of sandstone and terracotta perched on a hill overlooking a quintessentially Tuscan landscape of olive groves and vineyards and winding gravel roads. In any other corner of the world, Siena would be the only show in town.Around here though, there are several noisy neighbours. And none makes more of a racket than Florence, 50 miles north, famously the birthplace of the Renaissance and home of the Medici, Michelangelo, Giotto and Leonardo da Vinci. These days, it’s also famous for tourist tuk-tuks and newspaper stories about €25 ice-creams, as overtourism slowly erodes the city’s appeal. Which is why it’s better to avoid the roped-off processions of the Uffizi and choose Siena for an art lovers’ city break instead. (And for anyone who can’t make it to Chianti, the National Gallery in London will begin an extensive exhibition,Siena: The Rise of Painting, 1300-1350, in March. It will showcase the city’s importance to European art and its vital role as a catalyst of change.)View image in fullscreenGiven Florence’s touristic predominance, it is not obvious to many that for a long time these two great Tuscan city-states were rivals. Neither on the coast or a great river, Siena was not the most obvious place for a prosperous city-state, but its strategic location on the route from Rome to the rest of Europe made it both economically and culturally important. Siena became one of the great urban centres of Italy, cementing its status with an unlikely military victory against the more numerous forces of Florence in 1260.That coup instilled the city with a confidence and a sense of identity that can still be seen nearly 800 years later. Funded by merchants, Siena’s craftsmen and artists transformed the city with audacious public buildings and groundbreaking works of painting and sculpture in what would become known as theSienese School. It isn’t as widely appreciated these days as that which came after it, unfortunately, perhaps because it ended all too suddenly.View image in fullscreenThe vaulted ceiling of the city’s gothic cathedral took almost 200 years to complete.Photograph: alxpin/Getty ImagesAfter a period of prosperity and pre-eminence in the 13th and 14th centuries, Siena’s luck ran out in 1348 when the Black Death arrived, eventually wiping out half of its population, including most of its artists and craftsmen. While work on its four miles of fortified walls – extended on a regular basis until then – was stopped in its tracks, its great rival, Florence, went on to dominate Tuscany and the late Renaissance. But it’s no exaggeration to say that without Siena’s influence, that great period of artistic revival would have looked very different.The cathedral’s vaulted ceiling is dizzying, while its stunning mosaic floor is almost overwhelming in its intricacyThe best place to get a sense of the Sienese School’s importance is the city’s gothic cathedral and the adjacentMuseo dell’Opera Metropolitana(Cathedral Museum). The cathedral is worth a visit for its facade alone, with its emphasis on contrast and verticality, and its mixture of gothic ideals and classical influence. It is, like much of Siena, an antecedent to the coming Renaissance, especially in terms of its sculptural elements. The work ofGiovanni Pisano, who has been referred to as the first modern sculptor, incorporated an expressive naturalism that was pioneering for the time.Inside, the cathedral’s vaulted ceiling is dizzying, while its stunning mosaic floor is almost overwhelming in its intricacy. It took almost 200 years to complete, and the 16th-century painter and art historian Giorgio Vasari called it “the most beautiful that ever was made”.But, as every self-respecting art fan will know, the cathedral’s main attraction – what was once its altarpiece – now lies in the Museo dell’Opera Metropolitana. Duccio di Buoninsegna’sMaestàis a double-sided work of impressive scale, both figuratively and literally. It epitomises the Sienese School, infusing the gothic tradition with new ideas about expressionism and narrative and moving it away from the rigid symbolism of the past. In Duccio, you can see so much of what was to come – bold colours, imaginative composition, emotion.Given how influential art historians now hold him to be, it seems very unfair that Duccio di Buoninsegna isn’t a household name.View image in fullscreenDuccio di Buoninsegna’s Maestà, painted between 1308 and 1311.Photograph: Album/AlamyA couple of hundred metres from the Duomo, thePinacoteca Nazionale di Siena(National Gallery of Siena) provides the most thorough overview of the city’s artistic heritage, from the early days of the Sienese School and the transformation of the Renaissance to later works from the restrained, devout Counter-Reformation (or Catholic Reformation). It is the world’s largest and most important collection of the era: Duccio features, of course, as do his contemporaries Simone Martini and the Lorenzetti brothers, Pietro and Ambrogio.It’s an ideal place to compare and contrast the Siena style against the more familiar naturalistic, scientific approach of the Florentine Renaissance. Because for all their innovation, the Sienese masters always retained a strong connection to the byzantine and gothic. Their goal was never a realistic ideal, it was an elegantly stylised narrative meant to transcend daily life and inspire faith. Seeing so many masterpieces of the era in one place gives a fresh perspective on the developments, and motivations, that drove European art in that period.But even after all that, the most enchanting part of Siena’s artistic appeal is the city itself. It is, in effect, an open-air museum, a maze of hidden frescoes, exquisitely carved fountains and crumbling arches, shaded alleys and sunny piazzas.In the busier months, Siena’s main square, the Piazza del Campo, will be bustling with activity, but unlike so many of Italy’s historic public spaces, it never feels cramped. Such is the scale of it – after all, they do use it to host a horse race, thePalio Di Siena(2 July and 16 August in 2025) – that you will always find a sunny spot to pitch up.View image in fullscreenSiena’s towers are visible from miles around.Photograph: Peter Zelei Images/Getty ImagesThe piazza is lined with restaurants and cocktail bars, but none are worth writing home about, and anyway, when the weather is good, it’s hard to beat the simple pleasure of a takeaway sandwich and a cold beer.Siena is so incredibly intact, architecturally, that its 20th-century apartments seem to blend into the gothic surroundings unnoticedFor the all-important postprandial coffee, leave the piazza and head one street over to theVia di Città, where you will find theTorrefazione Fiorella. Torrefazione means roaster in Italian, and they still roast their own selection of beans here, despite it being one of the smallest premises in the city.Suitably energised, and perhaps in need of a little variety after all that gothic goodness, a trip to one of Siena’sContrada museumsis an excellent way to delve a little deeper into the city’s history and culture. The 17contradeare Siena’s historic neighbourhoods, today most famously known for competing in the Palio horse race. Each has its own museum, full of quirky artefacts, local curiosities and, more importantly, a hall of victories where the contradas display their colourful trophy flags from the Palio. It’s the ideal way to explore Siena’s neighbourhoods with a little context – and along the way it will be almost impossible not to stumble upon a few artistic and architectural surprises.Siena is a place that can almost seem frozen in time. There are modern buildings, of course, but it’s so incredibly intact, architecturally, that its 20th-century apartment buildings seem to blend into the gothic surroundings unnoticed. And if you squint hard enough, or wear dark enough glasses, you may not even notice the other tourists.Where to stayHotel Palazzetto Rosso Art(doubles from £135) is a charming, quite basic place to stay, just five minutes’ walk from the Piazza del Campo. The medieval building has retained some nice features, in particular its stone window frames, and some of the rooms boast stunning views over the city’s clay-slated rooftops.Siena: The Rise of Painting, 1300-1350 is at the National Gallery, London WC2, from 8 March-22 June (adults £20, under-18s free,nationalgallery.org.uk)Explore more on these topicsTuscany holidaysItaly holidaysCultural tripsCity breaksEurope holidaysfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The country’s tourism industry is getting ready for a boostRebecca Ratcliffein BangkokSat 15 Feb 2025 12.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 15 Feb 2025 13.41 ESTShareGeeratiya Aunjarorn, like many ­people in Thailand, didn’t know much aboutThe White Lotus, the series that has gripped audiences in the US and UK, until early last year. But when it was announced that ­season three would not only be filmed in her country, but would also ­feature one of Thailand’s most famous pop stars,Lalisa Manobal– better known ­simply as Lisa – Geeratiya and legions of other fans have followed the ­filming closely.Over the past year, photos of the crew filming on the tourist islands of Phuket and Samui have gone viral across Lisa fan pages, and hashtags speculated on the kind of character the singer, from the K pop group Blackpink, might play. A premiere was held in Bangkok on Friday night and ­season three will be released on Sunday in the US and on Mondaytomorrow in the UK.“It’s very exciting for me – it’s her debut as a Thai actress, and she’s starring as a Thai character,” said Geeratiya, 36. She felt goosebumps when she heard Lisa, who often speaks in English in international interviews, using Thai in a promotional clip from the series. “I can hear her lines without having to translate it … I feel like it’s a little win for us.”View image in fullscreenK-pop star Lalisa Manobal – better known simply as Lisa – at Friday’s premiere in Bangkok.Photograph: Rungroj Yongrit/EPAThe country’s tourism sector is also excited. The show’s previous settings, Hawaii and Sicily, both saw surges in interest from tourists after appearing, leading to a phenomenon dubbed “theWhite Lotuseffect”. The first season, which was filmed at the Four Seasons Resort Maui at Wailea in Hawaii, prompted a 425% year-on-year increase in the hotel’s web traffic, according to reports. San Domenico Palace, a former monastery in Sicily that featured in season two, reported that it wasfully booked for months.InThailand, industry experts are hoping for a similar boost. Thienprasit Chaiyapatranun, president of the Thai Hotels Association, said he believed bookings had already increased. “The high season last year – November, December, and January – in the southern part of the country, especially Samui, was fully booked,” he said.He expected luxury parts of the market would benefit the most fromThe White Lotus, a satire on wealth and privilege. The series features some of Thailand’s most exclusive locations, including the Four Seasons Samui, a resort surrounded by pristine sandy beaches, ­tropical forest and the Gulf of Thailand. A two-night stay in March would cost upwards of £1,700.Marisa Sukosol Nunbhakdi, president of the tourism subcommittee of the National Soft Power Strategy Committee, said she believed the series, which explores spirituality and Buddhism, could also help establish Thailand as a spiritual or wellness destination, one of the government’s ambitions.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Thailand has increased financial incentives to attract film-makers, with greater perks offered to those who base their productions in lesser-known locations.Thailand has faced a challenge in trying to redistribute tourism more evenly across the country, said Marisa. There are concerns aboutover-tourism in areas such as Samui, where the number of visitors has placed pressure on water and energy supplies, as well as waste management.Thailand’s tourist industry has mostly recovered since the ­pandemic brought international travel to a standstill, though visitors from China, a crucial market, are still lagging, added Marisa.View image in fullscreenThe island of Samui, where filming took place.Photograph: Warner Brothers Discovery/PATheWhite Lotuseffect is mostly expected to draw visitors from English-speaking countries. Lisa Manoban’s presence could also lead to more travellers from south-east Asian countries such as Indonesia and the Philippines, say her fans. Lisa, 27, from Buriram, north-east Thailand, who rose to fame with Blackpink, is known not only for her singing and rapping, but also her dance routines. The band’s members are also pursuing solo careers, with Lisa releasing the albumAlter Egothis month, and her song Born Again, which features Doja Cat and Raye, also appearing on theWhite Lotussoundtrack.“Whatever Lisa does always goes viral,” said Geeratiya. When Lisa visited Wat Mahathat, a temple in the ancient Thai capital Ayutthaya, and was photographed in traditional dress, the cityexperienced a surge in visitors, and even placed a sign indicating where Lisa had been photographed. An interview she gave in 2021, in which she said she craved the meatballs sold by street sellers in her hometown Buriram, caused sales of the grilled and deep-fried snacks to sky rocket,local media reported.The White Lotus: Blackpink member Lisa joins cast for third seasonRead more“As a Lisa fan, and as a K-pop fan, we all like to try to revisit the places that the stars have been – to go to the restaurant that has featured in the production, or check in at the same place,” said Nichaphon Vongpukdee, 37. He would also try to visit some of the series locations, he said, though perhaps not the five-star hotels. “If I win the lottery, I will go for sure.”Nichaphon, along with Geeratiya, was among about 200 fans who won tickets to attend the premiere of the new season in Bangkok on Friday. They haven’t yet watched season one or two, but plan to get HBO accounts just to watch Lisa’s acting debut.Narubes Chuaycho, an 18-year-old student, said he was overjoyed to be at the premiere and believes the series will help promote Thailand’s tourism. But as he waited for the stars to arrive on Friday afternoon, he added: “I’m more excited to see Lisa in real life.”Explore more on these topicsThe White LotusThe ObserverThailandThailand holidaysAsiaAsia PacificfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It’s particularly suited to cosier cooking during the frigid months, or for unflustered catering for a crowd. When simmered gently in flavourful liquids at a low temperature, even the toughest of meats and the hardiest vegetables and pulses are coaxed into yielding, delicious comfort food. The beauty of a braise is how both the broth and the main ingredient are enriched when they linger together for some time, not to mention that it is also mostly hands-off cooking.Aromatic coconut chicken and potatoes (pictured above)This whole chicken braised in a bath of rich, spice-laden coconut milk, is the perfect, cosy alternative to a traditional Sunday roast.Prep15 minCook1 hr 40 minRest30 minServes42tbsp ghee1½kg whole chicken2 large red onions, peeled, halved and sliced into fine crescents1tsp cumin seeds2 star anise1cinnamon stick, broken up2 red chillies6garlic cloves, peeled and roughly chopped7½cmpiece fresh ginger, peeled and roughly choppedSalt, to taste15 curry leaves3tbspmadras currypowder400g tinned chopped tomatoes800ml coconut milk800ml chicken stock3 medium potatoes, peeled and cut into large wedgesJuice of1 lime1 handfulfresh coriander leaves, finely choppedMelt the ghee in a large, deep casserole pot on a medium heat, then brown the chicken all over and set aside.

Similarly, the pasta shouldn’t taste plasticky; the closer it is to homemade, the better.I tested all these tortelloni with unsalted butter, side by side in batches, to give an accurate comparison of the seasoning.

Otherwise, they’re well-seasoned and not stodgy, with a nice, light texture. The pasta tastes a little mass-produced, but it’s basically fine.

It’sTonkotsuin east London, a canteen-style place where the kids can slurp noodles out of bento boxes to their hearts’ content and everything is wipe-clean, yet simultaneously classy. My order is always the chilli tofu hiyashi noodles, which are spicy, creamy, sharp and crunchy all at once. Naturally, I fell for them and had to try to make something similar at home. These are not as chirpy and bright as Tonkotsu’s, which have a citrussy ponzu base, and they’re a bit broodier, too, but nevertheless I’m now addicted.Tahini and soya mince noodles with pickled radishesYou’ll need chilli bean sauce, otherwise known asdoubanjiangortoban djan,to make this.Lee Kum Keemake a great and widely available one.Prep10 minCook35 minServes4150g radishes, trimmed and finely sliced150ml unsweetened rice vinegar1 tsp caster sugarFine sea salt8 tbsp tahini4 tbsp chilli bean sauce1 tbsp agave syrup4 tsp toasted sesame oil4 tbsp rapeseed oil, plus extra to dress the noodles4 garlic cloves, peeled and minced4cm piece fresh ginger, peeled and finely grated90g spring onions, chopped and rinsed120g dried soya mince180g ramen noodles50g toasted white sesame seedsPut the radishes in a heatproof bowl.
