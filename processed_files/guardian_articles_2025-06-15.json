Silicon Valley. An agricultural sector that grows more than three-quarters of fruits and nuts in America. All contributed to April’s news that California had officially overtaken Japan to become thefourth biggest economy in the world, its GDP of $4.1tn trailing only the entirety of the US, China and Germany.But two months later this superpower is locked in a bitter power struggle with Washington DC. Days of protests over immigration raids in Los Angeles prompted Donald Trump todeploy military forcesagainst what he called “insurrectionists” despite strenuous objections from state and local leaders.The US president even endorsed the arrest of California’s governor, Gavin Newsom, who accused Trump of manufacturing a crisis,filed a lawsuitagainst the administration and warned in a televised address that America was on the brink of authoritarianism unless citizens take a stand.It is a fight that Trump has been spoiling for.Californiahas long occupied a special place in the imagination of his “Make America great again” (Maga) movement. Its name has become a cultural signifier for coastal elitism, illegal immigration and “wokeness” in Republican eyes. It is a $4tn enemy within.Los Angeles, city of immigrant protests: why it’s no surprise LA rose up against TrumpRead more“California, in a way, stands for the opposite of Trumpism,” saidBob Shrum, a Democratic strategist based in Los Angeles. “It stands for tolerance. It stands for diversity, the word that’s now verboten in the administration. It stands for helping poor people and people who’ve been left out. And it stands for giving a fair hearing, unpopular as it may be, to people who applied for asylum.”Immigration is in California’s cultural DNA.Even former governor Ronald Reagan, a diehard conservative, championed America’s status as a nation of immigrants when he was US president. In 2018 California became the first “sanctuary state” in the nation when its legislature enacted a law limiting local and state officials from cooperating with federal immigration authorities.Trump has lost California in three consecutive elections, most recently against Vice-President Kamala Harris, a daughter of immigrants to the Golden state. It wasa leader of the “resistance”against Trump’s first-term agenda, filing more than a hundred lawsuits to challenge the administration’s policies on immigration, environmental regulations, healthcare and other issues.The battle looks set to be even more intense second time around. Newsom secured $25m to fund legal fights and “Trump-proof” the state. California sued the administration 16 times in the first 100 days, nearly double the pace of Trump’s first term, over issues including birthright citizenship, healthcare, education, federal job cuts and tariffs.Hostilities broke out during California’s devastating wildfires when Trump sought to blame Newsom and other officials and threatened to withhold federal aid unless the governor changed the state’s environmental policies.View image in fullscreenDonald Trump talks with Governor Gavin Newsom after arriving at Los Angeles international airport on 24 January.Photograph: Mark Schiefelbein/APThe president has since repeatedly spun a yarn about how he sent Los Angeles critical water that its leaders failed to provide. “I invaded Los Angeles, and we opened up the water, and the water is now flowing down,” he boasted in March. Yet the 2bn-plus gallons of water that Trump ordered to be released from two dams in the Central valley agricultural hubdid not actually go to Los Angeles.California’s leadership in climate action, including strict tailpipe emissions standards under the Clean Air Act, has also been a target. The president’s advisers proposed limiting the state’s authority to set its own emissions standards, a move that failed in his first term but could gain traction with a more Trump-aligned supreme court.Then, inevitably, came the showdown over immigration, a political gift for Trump as he sought to deflect attention from his feud with the tech billionaire Elon Musk and Republican divisions over his tax and spending bill.The spark was aggressive raids by federal agents against immigrants in Los Angeles’ fashion district, in a Home Depot car park and several other locations. Protests started in downtown Los Angeles before spreading to Paramount andneighboring Compton.Most were peaceful but some demonstrators attempted to block border patrol vehicles by hurling rocks and chunks of cement. In response, agents in riot gear unleashed teargas, flash-bang explosives and pepper balls.As images of blazing cars and masked protesters waving Mexican flags went viral in rightwing media, with an assist from the White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller’sX social media account, Trump realised his opportunity to strike California had come.He sent thousands of national guard troops and marines to Los Angeles, telling reporters: “You have violent people, and we’re not gonna let them get away with it.” It was an extraordinary breach of state sovereignty that Newsom said was unwarranted, politically motivated and likely to pour fuel on the fire.But it was a familiar playbook for Trump, who revels in spectacle and haspreviously promoted a videoof Venezuelan alleged gang members having their heads shaved or being manhandled by guards. The show of strength allowed him to highlight his core issues: immigration enforcement, “law and order” and a battle against a state that is the ultimate bastion of progressive values.View image in fullscreenA woman, wearing a traditional Mexican dress, holds an American flag, as part of a musical and dance performance on Los Angeles City Hall steps on Friday.Photograph: David Swanson/ReutersShrum, who worked for Al Gore and John Kerry’s presidential campaigns and is director of the Center for the Political Future at USC Dornsife, said: “He likes to make an enemy of California. California can be his bete noire, an example of everything he claims is wrong. It can appeal to parts of his base that resent the so-called coastal elites that they claim have run the country up to now.”He added: “The whole thing in LA is confined to about two square blocks; 99.99% of one of the world’s great cities is functioning in a very normal way. But Trump has been able to use this as a pretext to do what he’s wanted to do all along – and wanted to do in 2020 – which was call out the armed forces to suppress dissent. In the meantime he is enjoying the prospect of a fight withGavin Newsom.”There is personal animosity and political rivalry between Trump and Newsom, who is seen as a potential future presidential candidate. Trump has used derogatory language such as “Newscum” and even publicly backed his border czar Tom Homan’s idea of arresting Newsom for potentially interfering with federal immigration enforcement. He said: “I would do it if I were Tom. I think it’s great.”Newsom responded defiantly, “Come and get me, tough guy,” andwrote on X: “The President of the United States just called for the arrest of a sitting Governor. This is a day I hoped I would never see in America. I don’t care if you’re a Democrat or a Republican this is a line we cannot cross as a nation – this is an unmistakable step toward authoritarianism.”Newsom and the state also pushed back against the federal intervention through legal means and public statements. California is suing the Trump administration over the troop deployment, arguing that it is illegal, immoral and unconstitutional.In televised remarkson Tuesday, Newsom said: “Democracy is under assault right before our eyes – the moment we’ve feared has arrived.”But some argue that the governor is playing into Trump’s hands.Bill Whalen, a political consultant and speechwriter who worked for Pete Wilson and Arnold Schwarzenegger, former Republican governors of California, said: “You have Democratic leaders all insisting these are peaceful rallies and peaceful protest and then you see the visuals which show rocks and cinder blocks being thrown and cars on fire and people on motorcycles coming out of the smoke to wave Mexican flags. That’s not peace. That’s not a 60s love-in by any means.”Whalen, a research fellow at the Hoover Institution thinktank at Stanford University, added: “Elissa Slotkin, the senator from Michigan, made a comment about her party not too long ago. She said the problem with the Democratic party is it’s perceived as weak and woke. That is what Trump feeds on: the perception of weakness and wokeism. Here in California Gavin Newsom, Mayor Karen Bass, California’s leaders writ large play into that perception.”View image in fullscreenA person walks past US marines outside the Wilshire Federal Building, after they were deployed to Los Angeles, on Friday.Photograph: David Ryder/ReutersThe duel has highlighted a shift from traditional conservative defences of states’ rights towards a more centralised approach under Trump, who has sought to expand executive power and enforce a rightwing agenda through federal coercion.ThePolitico website has reportedthat the administration is considering cutting federal education funds to California. Democrats point out that California contributes significantly more in taxes than it receives back. The state sent$83bn moreto the federal government than it received in the fiscal year 2022.Drexel Heard, a Democratic strategist who lives in Los Angeles, said: “California represents everything that is the United States: 39 million people from all over the place, different ethnicities, different religions, different socioeconomic backgrounds.“We are the antithesis to the Stephen Miller – ironically, from Santa Monica – view of what America should be. We are the immigration state of the country. We are the socioeconomic state of the country with the fourth largest economy in the world. AndDonald Trumpdoesn’t like the fact that nobody in California gives a shit about him.”"

Except the test conditions are so flawed it does no such thing…Jack SealeSun 15 Jun 2025 18.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 15 Jun 2025 18.01 EDTShareHundreds of people die on British roads every year, with tens of thousands injured – and the multi-vehicle motorway crash is the most terrifyingly lethal way a car journey can go wrong. But the good news is, reality TV is on the case. Welcome to the car-crash telly that is Pile Up: World’s Biggest Crash Test, a programme that, suitably enough, hurls several different documentary genres together with messy results.The problem that needs addressing is this. Experts studying road safety have long been able to propel cars into one other under laboratory conditions, but controlled tests lack the crucial element of flawed humans with unpredictable reactions; actual crashes obviously do involve fickle drivers, but we don’t know when they’ll happen, so nobody’s there to capture high-quality footage from every angle.The Rehearsal season two review – TV so wild you will have no idea how they made itRead moreThe solution, years in the making and dreamed up by top smash boffinProf James Brighton of Cranfield University, is a grand experiment that luckily lends itself to light-factual television. Four ordinary motorists are invited to attend a Scottish airstrip that has been converted to a lifesize mockup of a stretch of motorway. They are told they’re to take part in a study of driving habits. What they’re not told is that Brighton has arranged for an articulated lorry to drive sideways across all four lanes without warning, guaranteeing that the guinea pigs will be involved in a pile-up and allowing full scrutiny of their split-second attempts to avoid disaster.Even the lawless free-for-all that is reality TV in 2025 wouldn’t lure people into a probably-fatal car crash under false pretences, though, so all the vehicles have been rigged up to be driven remotely. The stooges sit in static cars a couple of hundred metres away, with their steering, accelerating and braking simulated in real time on a wraparound video screen. The problem with this is that it surely isn’t an accurate representation of how these people would react in real life. They can’t feel the acceleration when they press the pedal and aren’t burdened with the fear of serious injury.Perhaps to distract from this, or just to fill the inexplicably epic two-hour slot Channel 4 has given Pile Up, the programme throws all manner of other stuff at us. It leans into the reality-show element heavily, introducing us to its four disparate volunteers – a carefree 19-year-old woman, a man in his 20s who is a self-confessed boy racer, a nervous grandmother, and a guy who, er, doesn’t really have any pertinent foibles but seems nice – by filming them driving in everyday life, packing to leave for Scotland, meeting one other, being allocated a car, comparing notes after their test drives, and so on. Everyone’s encouraged to play up to their personality type, apart from the chap who doesn’t have one, and they’re soon caricaturing themselves happily.If that doesn’t entertain you, swathes of the programme are taken up with sensational dashcam footage of real incidents, of the kind normally featured in cheap documentaries on obscure satellite channels that are called something like Britain’s Worst Drivers Volume 12: B-Road Bedlam. Such shows marry up the barrage of clips with a torrent of facts, and Pile Up is no different: approximately 17% of the voiceover here is made up of intimidating statistics about speed limits and seatbelts.When the experiment does finally take place, it’s rigged with false jeopardy. Professional crash-scene investigators are invited to analyse the pile-up post hoc, without access to the slow-motion video and 3D modelling that everyone else is looking at, as a contrived test of their skills. Plus, it’s suggested that the test is not just groundbreaking, but controversial: “A lot of naysayers [said] this was never going to work,” says one of Brighton’s triumphant colleagues, after it’s all over. A lot of naysayers? Really? Sadly, the unlikely claim that the scientific crash-test community is a cesspit of cynical haters is left unexplored, but if they do exist, these naysayers may have had a point, since none of the most interesting conclusions end up deriving from the way the human drivers responded, which was meant to be what made the stunt unique.The thing is, though, none of this programme’s manifest snags really matter. The experiment may not have worked on its own terms, but the sense of dread when the innocent drivers are unknowingly approaching the hazard is real, as is their emotional reaction when they see the state their cars are left in. If people at home are disturbed enough to slow down and pay more attention next time they’re on a motorway, lives will be saved. Pile Up does get to somewhere worthwhile in the end, even if it takes a circuitous route.Pile Up: World’s Biggest Crash Test is on Channel 4 nowExplore more on these topicsTelevision & radioTV reviewTelevisionReality TVreviewsShareReuse this content"

The reasons for this are many and varied – I’m trying to save money, gym music is terrible these days, everyone seems to have forgotten how to share the equipment – but the main one is,I think itmay actually make me fitter.Working for Men’s Fitness magazine for almost 10 years, I got to try out every trend, workout style and fitness event I wanted, and I noticed something interesting: quite frequently, the people with the fewest resources were in the best shape. I’m not including Hollywood actors in this, but otherwise, it’s often true: powerlifters working out in unheated concrete sheds get the strongest, runners who stay off treadmills get the fastest, and people exercising in basements have a focus rarely seen in palatial upmarket gyms. Browsing through photos from when my own gym membership was (briefly) paused during Covid lockdowns, I look … if not quite like Jason Statham, then at least his off-brand office-party equivalent. I might not have had the best cardio of my life – even social distancing couldn’t convince me to run more than three miles (5km) at a time – but I was certainly lean.Some of the correlation and causation here might be muddled, obviously – Covid also prevented me from getting to my favourite cake shop – but let’s not worry about that right now.So what’s the plan? Well, as a 46-year-old father with a lot to do, I’m focusing onfitting workouts into my life wherever is feasible, combining cardio, strength and mobility as much as possible, and buying as little kit as I can. Here’s what I’m up to.Running, fastandslowOver recent years, it’s become increasingly clear thatVO2 max, a measure of your body’s ability to use oxygen during intense exercise, is a key indicator of health and lifespan: to the extent that it’s probably one of the main things worth focusing on for longevity. Unfortunately, building up a good VO2 max takes a little bit longer than getting strong – but therearethings you can do to speed the whole process along.One is the so-called “Norwegian protocol”: working out at a high intensity for four minutes, then at a lower intensity for three minutes, then repeating – four times altogether. With a warmup on top, you’re done in little more than 30 minutes – and if you do that once a week, any other running workouts can be more ponderous or plodding. Recently, I’ve been a regular at my localParkrun, which is always delightful – there are plenty of people far faster than me to keep me motivated, but nobody bats an eye if you put an audiobook on and turn in a 40-minute three miles.The final thing I’m doing run-wise is hill “sprints” – a bit of a misnomer, as my nearest hummock is angled so steeply that I can barely get up it faster than a jog. This is actually a good thing; with a couple of hamstring pings in my past, my actual sprinting days are probably over, but the hilly variety still force you to work hard, generate power with each stride, and recruit dozens of muscle fibres with every step.Really simple strength workoutsView image in fullscreenStrength training can improve balance and mobility.Photograph: Adrian Sherratt/The GuardianBeing strong is good for you: apart from the obvious benefits (carrying furniture, shopping and weary children), it can improve bone density, balance and mobility, heart health, andmight even have protective effects against dementia. Some sort of strength training should be a non-negotiable part of your workout week, but the good news is that it really doesn’t have to take long –recent researchsuggests that two “sets” of exercise per body part, per week can be enough to build strength, with the diminishing returns kicking in quickly afterwards.These workouts can also be very simple: unless you want to look like a Marvel character, there’s no need for dozens of movements. All you really need to focus on is what many trainers call the fundamental human movements: push, pull, squat, “hinge”, and carry – all of which can be done with a kettlebell, set of dumbells, or a bag of books if you’re on a budget. My twice-weekly strength plan is as simple as it gets: two sets each of overhead presses (push), one-armed rows (pull) and goblet squats (hopefully obvious), and one set of kettlebell swings (this is the “hinge”, but so is any movement where the power comes from your hips, from picking a weight off the ground to doing the long jump). I get my carrying by doing the shopping – I usually do a big bagload or two once or twice a week.Greasing the grooveThis style of working out – popularised by former Soviet strength coachPavel Tsatsouline– has been around for decades, but it’s never been more relevant than in an era where lots of people work from home. The idea is that you’re getting into the groove of the movements you do a lot, so not just working out your muscles but also your neuromuscular efficiency, or how well your brain and nervous system can activate your muscles.Basically, you do one or two exercises at a relatively manageable intensity multiple times throughout the day, rather than in one workout session. Each set ought to feel fairly easy (you never go to “failure”, or even get sweaty), allowing you to focus on perfect form and make your body more efficient at recruiting muscle fibers. It won’t make you huge, if that’s the goal – but it will make you stronger.I’m currently doing it with pullups. There’s a bar in my kitchen, so whenever I let our new pup out in the garden – for a wee, for a little dash around, for the sheer joy of trying to eat a plastic plant-pot – I do seven or eight pullups, or roughly half the number I could manage if I really tried. I don’t do another set for at least half an hour; I might do anywhere between three and about 10 sets a day: and in a couple of weeks, I’ll probably add a rep or two. It’s a great system for pullups, but it also works for more beginner-friendly movements – you could try it with wall pressups, squats, or lunges.View image in fullscreenAnother style of working out involves doing one or two exercises, such as squats, at a manageable intensity multiple times throughout the day.Photograph: Adrian Sherratt/The GuardianMaking a sandbagSandbags, now making a comeback in functional fitness classes andHyrox events, are great for lots of reasons. They challenge your body in a way that’s difficult to do with barbells alone, working your stabiliser muscles and challenging your balance even at lower weights. You can also drop them on most sorts of flooring without too much fuss. And here’s the secret: you can make your own sandbag, which is better and more versatile than most pre-made sandbags, for a fraction of the cost of the ones you see in the gym.My preferred method is to fill a bunch of little sandwich bags with builders’ sand (20kg in total is enough to start with), then duct-tape them closed: this helps to minimise leakage, and lets you adjust the weight. After that, just fling as many as you’d like in an old duffel bag or rucksack, and play around with it: lift it off the ground, squat with it on your shoulders, press it overhead or do glute-bridges with it balanced across your lap (much more comfortable than a barbell). You’ll build the sort of strength that lets you throw a bag effortlessly into an overhead locker, and also be ready for the next idea …Rucking on the school run“Rucking”, or putting on a big backpack and going for a hike, might be better for most people than running: there’s less impact on your joints, it builds a bit more strength in your legs and core, and it still elevates your heart rate and challenges your cardio. It’s currently catching on as a trend, withdedicated clubsand ergonomically designed “plate carrier” bags that cancost upwards of a hundred pounds– but let’s be realistic, there’s nothing to stop you throwing a few books in a rucksack and carrying it along on your everyday activities.For me, the school run is perfect: it’s about a mile each way, there are a couple of big hills, and if I get too out of breath to talk, my seven-year-old’s perfectly happy to pick up the conversational slack. I’ve been loading myself up with 10kg for the trip for a couple of weeks now, and I’ll probably add to that soon – if anything, it makes the treats I pick up at the en route bakery a lot easier to justify.… and walking a lotIt’s the simplest thing of all, but one of the most worth doing. One2022 studyfound that taking up to 10,000 steps a day has protective effects against cardiovascular disease and cancer, but the benefits go far beyond that – walking in nature seems toimprove mental health, while daily walks also seem to correlate withimproved sleep. I’m lucky that I live in a very walkable city, and semi-lucky that I work from home – even though I don’t have a commute to worry about, I quite often go for a little wander around (with my dog), to solve work problems that seem impossible when I’m sitting at my desk. Try skipping the headphones for a couple of weeks – you’ll probably notice a big difference in how much creative thinking and problem-solving you get done.Thekit listYou can get enough equipment to give you dozens of home-workout options for just more than 30 quid – less than a month’s membership at most gyms. Once you’ve got the workout bug, upgrade as you save. Here’s the order to invest in.Resistance bands (£5+)These are excellent for back health and shoulder mobility. Doing a few band pull-aparts (hold the band in front of your chest and stretch it until your arms form a T with your body) whenever you have a spare moment will work wonders for your posture and dislocates (where you hold the band with straight arms, then slowly raise it over your head and behind your back).Adjustable dumbbells (£20-£60)These can be as basic as you like: the main thing to bear in mind is that, after a while, they might not be heavy enough to actually challenge you much. Aim for a pair that you can load up to at least 10kg each – you can use them for everything from squats to overhead presses, and they’ll let you directly target muscle groups that are tough to hit with bodyweight alone.An ab wheel (£7+)These are underrated – they’re cheap, light enough to throw in a bag, and might be the only bit of kit you ever need to train your midsection.Ab wheel “rollouts”(the main movement you’ll do with them) are a move to build up to – even one can be tricky, so start off by rolling towards a wall that’ll stop you short of the full move, or even practising your roll on a shallow incline (if you can find one). These aren’t absolutely essential, but if you can hold a plank for two minutes, it might be time to step it up.‘Ten minutes a day will make you significantly fitter’: personal trainers on the best home exercise kitRead moreA pullup bar (£20+)You might never plan to do a pullup, but these can be handy simply for doingdead hangs– and if they’re securely anchored enough, you can also use them with a suspension trainer (see below). The version that clips over a doorframe will be fine for pullups, but if you’re planning on anything fancier, consider the style that screws into the wall.A kettlebell (£20-£40)The key thing about kettlebells is picking one with a nice shape to it – the official “sport” versions come in a standard size (with a chunky “bell” section) that should rest nicely against your forearm when you’re doing more complex movements. The other consideration is weight – if you’re only getting one (because they’re pricey), you’ll want the option that allows you to do the most movements, with a weight that’s easy enough to lift at first but still stays reasonably challenging as you get stronger. A 12kg or 16kg kettlebell will work if you’ve never exercised before, but consider a 20kg version if you’re a bit stronger.A suspension trainer (£40+)These are the priciest thing on the list, and not strictly necessary – but if you’ve got somewhere to put one up (or a nearby tree), they’ll vastly increase the movements you can do, including the excellent-for-your-shoulders inverted row.TRXis the brand everyone knows, but there are lots of others that are equally good – read the reviews.Explore more on these topicsFitnessHealth & wellbeingAgeingHealthRunningfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It was ludicrous, condescending, half-baked, opportunistic and plain stupid. Evenhedidn’t seem to know exactly what he wanted. At a Reform UK press conference in Port Talbot, he seemed tomake the casefor reopening the town’s steel-making blast furnaces, before admitting that “it might be easier to build a new one”, though he also acknowledged that it would “cost in the low billions” to do so. But he had even more dizzying visions of reopened Welsh mines. “If you offer people well-paying jobs … many will take them,” said Farage, “even though you have to accept that mining is dangerous.”The climate crisis, predictably enough, was not worth considering. He also did not offer any opinions about coal-related issues such asslag heaps, land slips, rivers that run black, and unimaginableunderground disasters. When he was asked where new pits might be located, he blithely offered the opinion that it “comes down to geology”. That is true, up to a point, but he would surely also have to think about thehousing developmentsandbusiness parksthat often sit atop all those disused coal seams.The whole thing was – of course – politics on the level of pub bullshit, but Farage and his people presumably knew that. What mattered was the resulting spectacle: Britain’s foremost populist proposing to “reindustrialise” Wales, in the face of entirely reasonable doubts, mockery and outright opposition from voices easily maligned as the usual distant elites. In that sense the visit was a win, repeating a formula that has been working for a very long time.Besides Farage’s own enviable political skills, there are obvious reasons for that. The first is to do with the fact that the basic social and economic conditions that fed into the rise of the UK Independence party and the Brexit referendum remain unchanged. It seems, in fact, to be 2016 for ever: Britain is still a country of anaemic growth and productivity, ongoing local austerity, stagnant wages and fear of the future. Those conditions explain people’s ever-deepening disdain for mainstream politicians, and their sense that as life constantly goes round in circles, Westminster does not seem able or willing to break the pattern.Every grim rotation, moreover, seems to be accompanied by ever-more extreme manifestations of the country’s dysfunctionality. Our passage to a new political era used to be marked by the results of elections and referendums. But of late, it feels as if more vivid proof of where we are heading is provided by civil disturbances. Last year’s summer riots were an obvious example. In the same week that saw massedviolence in Salford, we have just seen horrific outbreaks ofracist violencein Northern Ireland, and Farage hasoffered opinionsthat follow his usual slippery script: “I just wonder whether it is not a deeper, broader problem we saw something of after Southport last year. You know what? If they’d listened to me, none of this would have happened.”A question not asked enough in political journalism is what life in contemporary Britainfeelslike. The answer in part comes down to a profound sense of tension and a constant, latent fear that something awful is about to happen. Farage attracts supporters by offering himself as an answer to that feeling – but to those who recoil from him, he is the source of it. Like Donald Trump, that combination makes him a very zeitgeisty politician.Why does Nigel Farage get to play British politics on easy mode? | Andy BeckettRead moreSo does his presence on social media – which, even if most politicians do not yet understand it, has changed what is required to be a successful public figure even more radically than TV once did. Farage has 1.3 million TikTok followers, as many asevery other Westminster politiciancombined. Particularly since Elon Musk turned Twitter into X, he is regularly cited and praised in the parallel news universe that millions of people now take their information from – full of scurrilous rumours and explanations for events rooted in QAnon-like conspiracies. That ecosystem blurs into the nightmarish version of reality X offers as a kind of mood music, represented by endless videos of violence and hostile altercations between members of the public. All this suits Farage – and Farage-ism – just fine.His key asset is a diagnosis of people’s problems that gets simpler and sharper by the week: you are scared and struggling, he and his allies tell the public, because the government spends too much money on foreigners and is full of privileged and snobby people who know nothing of your pain. The Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham recentlygave an interviewto the centre-left journal Renewal, in which he mused on what effective political communication now entails. The governments led by Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, he said, operated in “a world of nuance”, but social media “just ended all of that”. What he said next sounded like a brisk answer to why Farage is winning: our modern means of communication, he said, “changed politics, and politics hasn’t changed enough to reflect that … people want instant opinions from elected representatives. They want authentic opinions”.Six weeks ago I watched Farage do a walkabout in a neighbourhood of Scunthorpe, surrounded by crowds of people jostling to take pictures of him on their phones. Not long after he had been presented with an Airfix tank, he commented that all the attention was “the benefit of just being real, you know what I mean?” Clearly, just like Boris Johnson in his pomp, a great deal ofhis persona– the clothes, the pints, every calculated pronouncement – is actually affectation and pretence. But politics is now so low on charisma and the common touch that simply being comfortable in your own skin looks like a kind of spectacular normality.Wales needs a green future, not Nigel Farage’s coalmine fantasy | LettersRead moreIn that sense, Starmer and Labour’s other high-ups might be Farage’s ideal adversaries. With the possible exception of Angela Rayner, they are mostly bloodless and hesitant. They cling on to a presentational style that is 20 years out of date, built around pre-ordained news themes on theproverbial “grid”, set-piece interviews, and complicated and chronically abstract rhetoric: “missions”, “renewal”, the constant chase for growth. Of late, the prime minister has tried his own occasional approximations of Farage’s approach,putting upsuch blunt and boastful online posts as: “I’ve already returned over 24,000 people with no right to be here. And I won’t stop there.” But that style rings hollow, because he doesn’t have Farage’s swaggering confidence nor any understanding of how to bring such directness to the way he talks about Labour’s fundamentals: the economy, jobs, public services.There is also something to be said about how the government intends to change the country. After a wasted year, last week’s spending review contained a surprising amount of good news, not least on housing. But it was all about the kind of investment that will not start to become visible until 2028 or 2029. Everyday life, it seems, will continue moving in ever-decreasing circles for another three or four years. That is a long time for Farage to carry on making mischief, as he illustrates an aspect of modern Britain too little understood – that, to an extent that vividly illustrates other people’s colossal failures, he looks like the only front-rank figure who understands how 21st-century politics actually works.John Harris is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

But is it worth the risk?Rhiannon Lucy CosslettSun 15 Jun 2025 07.00 EDTShareThe first time I gave him a gummy, I thought, ‘Oh my God, have I killed him?’ He just passed out in front of the TV. That never happens.” Jen is remembering giving her son, David, six, melatonin to help him sleep.  She got them from a friend, a paediatrician who gave them to her own child. “It was sort of hilarious. She had half a tub of gummies, and her husband met my husband in a car park near a roundabout to hand them over, like some underhand black-market deal.” Her tone is light, but in fact she and her husband were becoming increasingly desperate for sleep. “They were like gold dust.”By meeting in the car park to exchange the gummies, the husbands weren’t breaking the law, exactly, but they were stepping into a legal grey area. Melatonin is a synthetic version of the sleep hormone that occurs naturally in our bodies, rising at night in response to darkness and helping us get to sleep. It isn’t strictly illegal in the UK, but it is a prescription-only medication, and it can only be prescribed to children by a paediatrician under a specific set of circumstances, usually for children with a diagnosis of autism or ADHD. The rationale for this pathway is so that the paediatric specialist can rule out any potentially physical causes or underlying disease relating to the sleep disorder. Side-effects can include drowsiness the next day, nausea and feeling dizzy.In other European countries melatonin is far more accessible, often sold in pharmacies, although the guidelines for use in children are the same (both there and in the UK, it is licensed only for children with autism and ADHD). In the US, meanwhile, where it is far less regulated, you can buy it in supermarkets, even from Amazon, and it is often specifically targeted at children. Some gummies come in the shape of teddy bears, or are marketed using cartoon characters. There, it is routinely given to neurotypical children: nearlyone in five US children under 14are now consuming melatonin. In light of more restricted access in the UK, British parents are increasingly looking to the internet to purchase gummies, often with little medical oversight or supervision.David never slept, Jen tells me. Even as a newborn he was unusually alert. Where other babies ate and slept, he ate and was awake, and never settled easily. “In the early days you’re in good company,” she says, of the sleep deprivation. But, as time went on, she began to feel increasingly isolated.“People kept saying it will improve when he starts nursery, when he starts preschool. It never did. We just never had an evening. We’d be putting him to bed, sometimes, at 11 o’clock or midnight.” David was also having massive meltdowns. Despite trying a calm bedtime routine, nothing seemed to be working, and it was taking a toll on the entire family. Jen was so exhausted she was forced to stop working completely.As David grew, his parents started to suspect neurodivergence. He could count to 20 at 18 months, and was doing 30-piece jigsaw puzzles. An educational psychologist has recently confirmed that he is gifted to the extent that it will affect his life significantly, and he has been on the waiting list for an autism assessment for two years. When he was five, he was taken to see a paediatric consultant in the European country they were living in at the time. “I think my pineal gland’s broken,” David told the doctor, much to everyone’s astonishment. He was prescribed melatonin, and their lives changed for the better overnight. Had they been living in the UK at the time, they would almost certainly still be waiting.View image in fullscreen‘One therapist said: if you give your child melatonin I’ll have to report you to social services’“Although people think of melatonin as a vitamin nowadays, it’s not. It’s actually a hormone that’s released by the pineal gland in the brain, and it does lots,” says Prof Paul Gringras, a sleep and neurodisability consultant at Evelina London children’s hospital, and president of the International PaediatricSleepAssociation. “The pineal gland connects with all different parts of the body and helps synchronise all the cells in the body to keep our body clock going. Although every cell in the body has its own little clock, they’re not synchronised and they need to be held together. Melatonin is one of the main messengers.”David’s description of his pineal gland as “broken” was rather astute, then. Certain populations of children, such as those with autism and ADHD, simply sleep far worse than typically developing children – Gringras tells me the rates are 70-80% of children with those diagnoses. My brother, who is autistic, mostly non‑verbal with very high support needs, was one such child. “It was soul-destroying,” my mum, Anna, remembers. “Just mind-bendingly exhausting.” Thanks to melatonin, prescribed by the paediatrician, she could get four hours of sleep a night. “He didn’t sleep for more than two or three hours at a time. What the melatonin did was keep him asleep for at least four hours and I could cope, just about, if I got four and a half hours.”I have seen first-hand the impact that sleeplessness can have on a family, and how neurodivergence and sleep issues are often intertwined. “Some children with autism lack a gene that helps convert a chemical in the body called tryptophan into melatonin. So if you measure melatonin levels in the urine, they’re actually producing less melatonin,” says Gringras. As for ADHD, those children do produce some melatonin, “but instead of it being the hormone of darkness, produced in the early evenings, they’re not producing it till way later, until two in the morning”.These families need help. If their child’s sleep is being managed by professionals, their parents are less likely to get divorced, lose their jobs, crash the car or have an accident. That’s not to say, however, that all these children must be medicated. Gringras is keen to emphasise that behavioural sleep programmes can be transformative, even in the most severe cases. In one sleep trial he ran,50% of the severely autistic children who were signed up didn’t need to take part in the medicated bit, because the behavioural strategies had been so successful. When he does prescribe melatonin, parents still need to keep the behavioural approach going so that they have learned new habits for when the melatonin stops working. “Even on the labelling of these medicines, it says: for children who have failed an appropriate behavioural intervention,” he points out. What concerns him, and other professionals I speak to, is the idea of melatonin as a sticking plaster.“Many of the [paediatric] community are on their knees. They have massive waiting lists. They don’t have psychologists. And this is one of my really big worries, that it kind of becomes a quick fix. No one thinks it’s better than the behavioural approach, but they just haven’t got time to do that. And it’s faster to write a prescription, but it’s not correct.”That is, of course, if you are even able to get hold of a prescription. Most of the parents I spoke to didn’t have one. They were buying melatonin on the internet, or while abroad. All of them felt conflicted, uneasy, even scared of the consequences. Some were waiting for a diagnosis, while others suspected neurodivergence but hadn’t gone down that path yet. All of them only spoke on condition of anonymity, and every single one of them was totally desperate for a good night’s sleep.‘It makes me feel like a drug dealer. It’s getting harder and harder to buy them.” I’m speaking to Charlotte, who, like Jen, has spent much of her child’s life enduring “endless evenings”, which she describes as “unbearable”. Her daughter, Edie, now 10, couldn’t settle. “She’d lie in bed moving around a lot, jerking her body. She just couldn’t sleep.”As a family, they tried everything. “We’d do bath time and lavender oil and reading a story and talking, and then we’d try leaving her on her own. Nothing worked. We’d just have to lie with her for hours.” They wondered quite early on if Edie had ADHD, but didn’t pursue diagnosis. “She’s really brilliant and wonderful, but she was quite volatile, and really quite hyperactive.”They first started giving her melatonin when she was eight, when Charlotte’s sister-in-law, a doctor whose disabled daughter takes melatonin, gave her some to try. Charlotte was astonished – not only did Edie go to sleep at 8pm, but the effect on her behaviour and mood was transformative. She started buying it online.Charlotte thinks that Edie’s volatility is directly linked to her sleep. A model student at school who struggled with peer relationships, she would mask, or hold it together, until she got home where she could become aggressive towards her parents and siblings. At times her mental health difficulties have been extreme. “She was getting more and more anxious and having very, very dark dreams and getting very upset,” says Charlotte. “She started banging her head against the wall till it bled. And then she started banging her sister’s head against the wall till it bled.” Things escalated. On one occasion Edie got on the roof and threatened to jump, saying she wanted to die.View image in fullscreenOne parent was worried her children would get addicted to melatonin, but after using it for about eight months they didn’t need it any more.Photograph: Diana Vyshniakova/Alamy“The fact that she couldn’t sleep was a massive contributor to her feeling super stressed and highly sensitive,” says Charlotte. “When we started giving her melatonin it got a lot better. Then last year I ran out of melatonin. I couldn’t buy it.” It was like a switch flicked inside Edie’s brain. “She tried to run in front of a speeding lorry because she said everyone hated her. And then she started holding knives to her neck. She didn’t want to go to school. And I didn’t know what to do.”Charlotte ran to the doctor’s surgery with her child in her arms. “We went to see a counsellor, and we borrowed some money to get her assessed. And it came back as not ADHD, but autism,” she says. She also had an emergency mental health appointment, but all they could offer a suicidal autistic child who struggles with groups was, astonishingly, group therapy nine months later. “Then they said, ‘How is her sleep?’ And I said, ‘Well …’, and the woman said to me, ‘If you are about to tell me that you give your child unprescribed melatonin, I will have to report you to social services and they will take action.’ And I was like, fuck. And it was really stressful.”Gringras is shocked when I tell him about the safeguarding threat made to Edie’s mum. It is true that safeguarding is very important, and buying medication on the internet comes with risks. In the US, there has been a spike in child hospitalisations – poison control centres there saw a 530% spike in reports of melatonin ingestion in children between2012 and 2021– andseven reported deaths since 2015, including a child as young as two months. Gringras points out that the lack of US regulation means there often isn’t dosage consistency across even a single jar of gummies.A study last year found that some contained an alarming 50mg of melatonin– 0.5-1mg is the recommended starting paediatric dose. Linking these deaths directly to melatonin is a challenge because you can’t exclude underlying health conditions or whether other medications played a part. Nevertheless, it is concerning.“I don’t think it’s fair to come down hard on a parent if they’re not getting the support they need, and they’re just doing something out of desperation. I think the real question is: why haven’t we been able to support the parent with behavioural advice? Why haven’t we been able to see the child and reassure them, maybe, hopefully, they don’t have something physically wrong? And why are we going to make them wait three years for a diagnosis?”All the parents I spoke to expressed unease, guilt and even fear at their decision to give their children melatonin bought online or abroad. Jen told me she was worried about being arrested, and, though the school Senco is aware the family uses it, she would hesitate to mention it to a GP. Even parents who were giving melatonin under some degree of medical supervision, usually from a family member who works as a doctor, felt anxious. I spoke to doctors who give their own children melatonin bought online but wouldn’t go on the record for fear of professional consequences.Although Edie now has an autism diagnosis, and Charlotte is finding it increasingly hard to get melatonin on the internet, the threat of a social services referral means she is now frightened to talk to a paediatrician about getting it prescribed officially. “The other day we had a hospital appointment. We were asked, does she take any medication? And I said no. And Edie looked at me and I just shook my head.”But it’s not only parents of neurodivergent children who are turning to melatonin. I spoke to a number of mothers who have given it to their neurotypical children. One, Isobel, says she has only used it a couple of times when taking an overnight flight, having obtained it from an American relative. “The first time, my daughter was four, and my youngest was nearly two. As they were one-offs, and as it’s sold for use by kids in the US, I wasn’t worried about the side‑effects and felt it was safe in that quantity.”Emily has been giving melatonin to her children – eight and four – for longer. She gave it to her eldest when she started year 1 and began struggling to get to sleep – sometimes she was awake until 11pm, and teachers had started raising concerns about how tired she was. “We’d have to drag her out of bed and she’d be exhausted. It was really distressing,” Emily said. At her wits’ end, and worried that her daughter was falling behind at school, she ordered some melatonin online. She did a lot of research, choosing a brand used by a paediatrician quoted in an article in the New York Times, and says she kept an eye out for side-effects such as sleepwalking or drowsiness the next day.View image in fullscreen‘If I could wave a magic wand, there would be behavioural support that coincides with melatonin’The effect, Emily says, was “life-changing”. “It freaked me out a little bit. I was like, oh my God, what have I done? What have I given to her? Why has this happened? But she fell asleep after 20 minutes and it felt very natural. She had a few stories. She just got naturally drowsy. She fell asleep. Then the next morning, she woke at a normal time, bright and ready for school.” After that, Emily gave her a gummy every night for eight or nine months, but says she no longer needs it.“I was really worried they’d get addicted to it, but it’s almost like the melatonin helped them form a new habit [of going to sleep at a decent time].” She now gives it to her youngest child, who at four-and-a-half developed similar issues, and it has had the same effect on bedtime. She has recommended it to a few parents she knows from school and some are also giving it to their children. “One friend, her partner died when her kid was very little, in a really awful, traumatic way. I think that kid was basically suffering from PTSD, would get really emotional at night and wouldn’t go to sleep. She came to me going, ‘Oh my God, I’m just having the worst time and I’m not getting any sleep and she’s not getting sleep …’ I was like, ‘Hey, it’s up to you whether or not you take this advice, but I would recommend this.’”Whether a child is neurodivergent or not, with the right insight and support, behavioural changes can be transformative for families, Kerry Davies, a sleep practitioner and founder of private sleep support servicethe Sleep Fixer, tells me. She has many years of experience, including working for the charity Scope as part of a joint NHS and local authority funding initiative within children’s services, with the goal of reducing melatonin prescription costs by supporting children to sleep without it.“I look at the whole picture: where the child’s at, where the parents are at. I do a phased, step-by-step guide based on what that family need,” she says. “How consistent is their morning wake-up time? Because this can often be a difficulty with children who perhaps sleep in late during the weekends but are woken up early during the week, which can confuse the body clock. I’ll ask what time are they actually falling asleep, and manage parental expectations around what might be appropriate.” She mentions some parents putting their children to bed far too early as an example.“Then we look at how much physical activity they’re getting during the day. Physical activity really helps to be able to fall asleep and maintain sleep. What’s their bedroom environment like? Is it consistent through the night? Do they struggle with noise? Do they struggle with silence?”Having such tailored support from a sleep practitioner can radically improve a family’s mental and physical health, but accessing it remains a problem. “It is a postcode lottery as to whether there’s a service or a sleep practitioner that you’re able to access,” Davies says. “The parents of neurodivergent children may have been failed a lot in their journey.”Davies says there should be behavioural support services in every country, regardless of where a child lives, and that with that in place she would feel comfortable if GPs were able to prescribe melatonin. She says: “If I could wave a magic wand, there would be behavioural support that coincides with melatonin, attempting to taper off while continuing that behaviour support so you have those long-term solutions.”Ultimately, this is about crumbling services, and desperate parents and children being left chronically sleep deprived without any support. Can they be blamed, then, for being at crisis point and trying to find a solution? Were they to be given the help they need, they might not need the melatonin at all. And, by giving it without official medical oversight, how can the children be supported to taper off?Gringras–who as part of amelatonin taskforcehas contributed to a guide for caregivers – says we know “hardly anything” about the long-term effects of melatonin use. “For children with autism, the best we’ve got is two years follow-up data, really. So we know over a two-year period it’s safe, but if you said to me, well, do we know it’s safe over a five-year period? The answer is no, we don’t. We hope it is. And whenever we prescribe a medicine, we’re never naive. It’s always a balance of benefits against harm. But if it’s a child who’s got significant learning problems, who’s tearing the house up and whose parents can’t cope, then that tips your balance.”Gringras agrees with the rationale that melatonin should only be prescribed by a specialist. It’s the wait for a diagnosis that is creating the biggest barrier. “I think we’ve made the diagnosis slightly too involved and time-consuming,” he says. “We spend less time managing it and too much time diagnosing it. I’ll be so unpopular with that [viewpoint].”View image in fullscreen‘I don’t really want to give my child something I don’t know is completely safe’He says sleep problems in early childhood should be a warning sign for developmental paediatricians who are assessing children with possible neurodivergence. Where he is convinced a child is autistic or has ADHD, due to it being very apparent, or there being a strong family history, he will sometimes prescribe the medicineoff-label(legally prescribing a medicine for a different use from the one it is licensed for).It was concerns over the long-term effects – including claims that melatonin can interfere with or even delay puberty (somethinga 2020 study found no evidence of) – that stopped one mother I speak to from continuing to administer it to her daughter. Like every parent I spoke to, Helen was spending hours each night trying to help her daughter calm down enough to sleep. It was affecting her mental health, and, one evening, out of sheer desperation, she gave her some melatonin in her drink. It worked instantly, and Helen carried on using it for a while, but, she says: “It didn’t sit comfortably with me. I didn’t want to be in a situation where I had to use melatonin to get her to sleep, and I didn’t feel comfortable using it long-term. I don’t really want to give my child something I don’t know is completely safe to take.”Charlotte understands this viewpoint, and shares much of the same feelings. Things had reached a point with Edie, however, where she could simply see no alternative. “I think it saved her life, ultimately, and saved our marriage and saved our family.”Some names have been changed.The Republic of Parenthood by Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett is published by September on 7 August (£18.99).

I do a lot, and never get credit for anything, but that’s OK, the PEOPLE understand.”His envoys face a challenge that appears to be deepening by the day, however, with Israel andIranwidening their attacks, and the casualty tolls rising.Israel attacked Iran’s energy industry and defence ministry on Saturday night, leaving a fuel depot ablaze through the night outside Tehran. It followed with evacuation warnings to civilians living near arms factories and on Sunday launched a rare daytime raid on the capital.Iran fired at least 70 missiles towards Israel and several evaded air defences. They hit a refinery in the north,killed four people in a Palestinian-majority townnear the Sea of Galilee and brought down part of a high-rise apartment block in Bat Yam, south of Tel Aviv.View image in fullscreenIsraeli soldiers search for survivors amid the rubble of residential buildings destroyed by an Iranian missile strike in Bat Yam, central Israel.Photograph: Baz Ratner/APIt was the heaviest missile barrage the country has faced, and the damage was shocking to many Israelis. Despite enduring years of rockets from Gaza and Lebanon, and months of missiles fired from Yemen by the Houthis, none of those groups could deploy the scale or destructive power of the Iranian attacks.At least 14 people were killed, three were missing and hundreds injured by Sunday morning.Benjamin Netanyahuvisited the site of the Bat Yam strike on Sunday to see the damage and meet rescue workers. “Iran will pay a very heavy price for the premeditated murder of civilians, women and children,” the prime minister said.In Iran the toll is many times higher, with at least 224 fatalities since Israel began its attacks, according to Iran’s health ministry. Spokesperson Hossein Kermanpour said on social media that 1,277 people had also been hospitalised, claiming that more than 90% of the casualties were civilians.‘There’s a smell of death in the air’: chaos in Tehran as residents try to flee or find shelterRead moreA finance analyst in Tehran said: “This is a massacre. The blasts haven’t stopped. Children are crying and we fear many civilians have been killed. There’s a smell of death in the air. I can’t stop crying.”An Israeli strike on Sunday killed the intelligence chief of Iran’s Revolutionary Guards, Mohammad Kazemi, along with two other officers, the IRNA state media news agency reported.“Three intelligence generals, Mohammad Kazemi, Hassan Mohaghegh and Mohsen Bagheri, were assassinated and fell as martyrs,” the agency said, citing a Revolutionary Guards statement.Late on Sunday the Israeli military said that it was striking surface-to-surface missile sites in Iran, its latest move in three days of escalating conflict.IDF spokesperson Nadav Shoshani wrote on X: “We are operating against this threat in our skies and in Iranian skies.”As fuel depots outside Tehran blazed on Saturday, Trump presided over theUS’s biggest military parade in decades. He later said the arsenal on display could be deployed against Iran if it targeted American assets.The US president said in a social media post: “If we are attacked in any way shape or form by Iran, the full strength and might of the U.S. Armed Forces will come down on you at levels never seen before.”There is little question that Israel would like the US to join its campaign.Only American weapons have the capability to reach parts of the Iranian nuclear projectsuch as the Fordow uranium enrichment plant, which is buried deep under a mountain.But while Iran has called off talks with the US on the future of its nuclear programme, and accused Washington of being Israel’s “partner” in the offensive launched on Friday, it has held off attacking US bases, embassies or other targets.View image in fullscreenA man looks over the front pages of Iranian daily newspapers outside a kiosk in Tehran.Photograph: Abedin Taherkenareh/EPAWith most of its top military leaders assassinated,Israel claiming domination of Iranian airspacefrom western Iran to Tehran, and several key nuclear sites seriously damaged, the regime in Tehran faces an unprecedented threat to its stability and possibly even its survival.Netanyahu has made no secret of his desire for regime change and on Sunday told Fox News that it “could certainly be the result” of the Israeli campaign.Trump has been more wary, and his administration vetoed a recent Israeli plan to kill the country’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Israel briefed the White House on the “credible” plan for assassination, but it was rejected by Americans as a dangerous escalation.The US president reiterated on Sunday as he departed for the G7 summit that he hoped for a deal between Iran and Israel, but added that “sometimes you have to fight it out”. He refused to say if he had asked Israel to pause its strikes.Iran’s foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, signalled on Sunday that Iran was open to attempts to de-escalate. If Israeli strikes on Iran stopped, “our responses will also stop”, he said, perhaps in an appeal to Trump’s promotion of himself as the ultimate dealmaker, and his election pitch that he would end America’s decades of overseas wars.The US is already trying to promote an exchange of messages with Iran to “calm tensions” with Israel, although the effort falls short of formal mediation, the Haaretz newspaper reported quoting foreign sources.Trump has spoken about the war with Iran’s allyVladimir Putinand the emir of Qatar, Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, who has been in direct contact with the Iranian president, Masoud Pezeshkian, since Friday.A map showing Israeli strikes on IranFriedrich Merz, the German chancellor, called the leader of Oman, Sultan Haitham bin Tariq al-Said, who had been due to host US-Iran talks, a government spokesperson said. They discussed the importance of halting the conflict and stopping Iran getting nuclear weapons.For Israel, Saturday night was the bloodiest of the conflict, despite its success in knocking out much of Iran’s military hierarchy and parts of its missile systems over the previous day.An Israeli military official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that even advanced air defences could not stop every missile when Iran launched large barrages, as it did on Saturday night.“In these amounts, of hundreds of projectiles, sadly there will be hits,” the official said. “Even the greatest aerial defence system doesn’t get to 100%.”Iran deployed about 70 missiles overnight, and dozens of drones, although Israel has a higher success rate intercepting those slower-moving projectiles. Over two nights, Iran fired about 270 missiles at Israel and 22 of them evaded air defences.View image in fullscreenWomen look at a building damaged after a missile strike in Tamra, northern Israel.Photograph: Ammar Awad/ReutersOne of those appeared to target a refinery in the northern city of Haifa. In a statement to the Tel Aviv stock exchange, Bazan Group said there were no injuries at its plant but pipelines and transmission lines were damaged, forcing some facilities to shut down.Netanyahu said he ordered the pre-emptive operation because Iranian progress towards developing nuclear weapons posed a critical security threat.After taking out the top of the military hierarchy and vital nuclear scientists, as well as striking key parts of the nuclear programme, Israel appears to be widening its campaign.It hit energy facilities overnight including an oil depot near Tehran that blazed through the night and a refinery in Bushehr province on the Gulf, and has told people living near arms factories in Iran to evacuate their homes.An Israeli military official said in the coming days there would be more attacks on “dual use” facilities and strikes to prevent Iran expanding its stockpile of missiles, estimated to stand at about 2,000 before Friday.Additional reporting by Deepa ParentExplore more on these topicsIsraelIranBenjamin NetanyahuDonald TrumpVladimir PutinQatarMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

When they heard the air raid sirens Manar and her daughters ran to the one on the second floor as they had practised, but the reinforced concrete did not protect them. They were blown apart and the floor under them fell on the safe room directly below, crushing Manal.The blast blew the core out of the building, and sent the neighbours flying. About 40 people were injured, though none of the wounds were life-threatening.“The explosion was so loud I can still hear it,” said Azmeh Kiwan, a 50-year-old homeowner who lived directly opposite.When he opened his eyes, the whole district was in total darkness. It was only when the town’s rescue workers came with their bright lights that the neighbours could see the road was full of rubble, and it was only when the sun rose that they saw body parts scattered on their terraces and roofs.View image in fullscreenThe rubble of the Khatib family home in Tamra.Photograph: Quique Kierszenbaum/The GuardianKheir Abu-Elhija, a local first responder, who was one of the first on the scene, said he had worked 20 years as a nurse and never seen anything like it.“The second floor safe room came right down on the first floor safe room and crushed everything,” he said. “The only way we could find Manal’s remains was by a trail of blood,” he said.The war between Israel andIraninvolves powerful modern weapons that can turn a human body into vapour and scraps in an instant. Israel also has modern air defences which have managed thus far to intercept most of the incoming Iranian missiles. And for three-quarters of the country there are underground bunkers, a virtual guarantee of survival.But the Khatib family did not have a bunker. They were Palestinian citizens of Israel, like the rest of the 37,000 population of this old hillside town in the Lower Galilee. And in common with most Palestinian-majority towns, Tamra does not have a single underground shelter. Like much else in Israel, there is nothing equal about the way death comes from the sky.“The Israeli government, since the creation of the state, didn’t invest in one public shelter for the Arab part of society,” Tamra’s mayor, Mussa Abu Rumi, said. The reinforced “safe rooms” in new-build houses are an inferior alternative, as the fate of the Khatibs showed, and Abu Rumi said only 40% of Tamra residents even have those.“I would like to think that the government, since missiles have become part of warfare, will start a multi-dimensional programme to invest in the Arab community, and building shelters would be part of that,” the mayor said.Asked if he thought the current hard-right coalition would pursue such a programme, he shook his head and admitted there was “no hope”.View image in fullscreenA rescue worker in the rubble of the Khatib home.Photograph: Quique Kierszenbaum/The GuardianWhile missile strike sites in Tel Aviv, Rishon ReZion and Bat Yam have been flooded with rescue workers, home front troops, police and volunteers, most of the clear-up in Tamra was done by neighbours and a handful of municipal workers.Taking a water break on a shaded terrace, Azmeh Kiwan and his elder brother Bassam, who live directly across from the Khatib house, made clear in an interview they identified themselves as Israeli Arabs. Tamra is an ancient Arab village, they pointed out.“I am from here. I belong to this place and I will die here,” Azmeh said. The brothers also declared themselves fully behind the war against Iran, a country they described as wellhead of terrorism.It was only afterwards, when the tape recorder was off, that another neighbour came forward to vent his anger, which he claimed was shared by all of Tamra, at a video that had circulated since last night.It was filmed from a nearby Jewish town, and showed missiles and Israeli interceptors streaking across the black sky, but when a missile falls short and slams into Tamra, you can hear people around the camera rejoicing.“To the village! To the village!” one man cries, and then several women’s voices join in, someone starts clapping and together they sing a verse that has become a Jewish extremist anthem. It consists of one line: “May your village burn” sung over and over again.“Please write about this,” the neighbour said. “If I say anything I will have 20 police cars at my house.”View image in fullscreenRubble outside the Khatib home.Photograph: Quique Kierszenbaum/The GuardianAbu Rumi said he knows where the video was made, and has informed the Israeli government and the police, but has little expectation of anyone being brought to justice.“We are trying to engage with Israeli society all the time,” the mayor said. “What we find is hatred, and people who don’t see you as a legitimate human being in this place.”He said the centre in Israeli politics had collapsed, and with it the few protections Palestinian citizens of Israel could count on.“The political power that the settler parties have in government is creating this division,” he said. “They just see you as an Arab no matter where you are from.”Ayman Odeh, a member of the Knesset who is a personal friend of the Khatib family, said: “There is a connection between the politics of this government and those who are celebrating this terrible situation.”Odeh argued that war with Iran is just the latest symptom of an untreated wound at the heart of the Middle East.“It is all connected to the Palestinian issue, and as long as we do not resolve the Palestinian issue we will keep going in circles for ever,” he said. He added that it was also the outcome of Benjamin Netanyahu’s need for conflict to stay in office.“Netanyahu is using this war for political reasons,” Odeh said. “He’s putting everyone in danger in the region with this war, and the war in Gaza. This is the most fascist and dangerous government that we ever had, and it is a danger to everyone.”Explore more on these topicsIsraelIranArab and Middle East unrestMiddle East and north AfricafeaturesShareReuse this content"

On Saturday evening, the pair held an informal meeting before watching the Stanley Cup ice hockey final on TV in an Ottawa bar. “That is what we’re concentrating on and encouraging in our discussions with international partners.”Asked what Starmer could do at the G7, he added: “Clearly, the Middle East will be a topic of discussion, and will be this afternoon in the bilateral with prime minister Carney, but we’ve been clear throughout that the only route to peace is through diplomacy and through de-escalation.”How the dismantling of Iran’s regional proxies paved way for Israel’s attackRead moreEarlier on Sunday, the Foreign Office warned Britons against travel to Israel or the occupied Palestinian territories, one of the UK government’s most severe warnings in recent memory.The updated guidance warned that insurance policies may be invalidated, describing the crisis as a “fast-moving situation” posing “significant risks”.It marks the biggest escalation of UK travel advice since October 2023, when the government urged citizens to avoid all but essential travel after the Hamas attacks of 7 October. Sunday’s blanket warning goes further still, reflecting the growing threat to foreign nationals as tensions between Israel andIranboil over into open confrontation.Speaking to reporters on Saturday, during the flight to Canada, Starmer refused to rule out defending Israel from Iranian strikes launched in response to Israel’s attack against Iran’s nuclear and military infrastructure, despite Tehran’s threat that such an action could lead toBritish bases in the region being targeted.Speaking earlier to Sky News, Rachel Reeves, the chancellor, said that while theUK had sentadditional RAF Typhoon jets and refuelling aircraft to the region, this was just a “precautionary” move.“It does not mean that we are at war,” she said. Reeves noted the UK has in the past helped intercept missiles heading towards Israel, and said similar defensive action could not be ruled out.“We have in the past supported Israel when there have been missiles coming in,” she said, adding that the government would act to protect British assets and potentially support its allies.Asked if the UK would back Israel if it seemingly wanted to go further than degrading Iran’s nuclear capabilities, with strikes intended to push for regime change in Tehran, the No 10 spokesperson said not.“We have always been clear Israel must abide by international law, but more broadly, as I say, we’ve always supported Israel’s right to self-defence and its right to protect its citizens,” he said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In retaliation, Israel launched strikes deep into Iranian territory, including sites linked to the Revolutionary Guard and the country’sSouth Pars gas field.Iran’s president, Masoud Pezeshkian, has threatened a “more decisive and severe” response if Israeli strikes continue. The nation’s foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, accused Israel of attempting to drag the war into the Persian Gulf, and warned the conflict could spread further if not contained.Araghchi also claimed Israel’s actions were designed to sabotage nuclear negotiations between Tehran and Washington, and alleged they could not have happened “without the US green light and support”.With oil prices rising and regional instability worsening, governments in the west are facing pressure to both contain the violence and protect critical energy routes.While in Ottawa on Sunday, Starmer spoke to the president of the United Arab Emirates, Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan.The UAE is a potentially significant player in any moves to calm down the conflict. In March, the emirate was the intermediary used to deliver a letter to Tehran from Trump suggesting negotiations over Iran’s nuclear programme.Explore more on these topicsKeir StarmerIsraelIranCanadaMiddle East and north AfricaMark CarneynewsShareReuse this content"

Of the 10 cases in which a suspect vessel was identified, eight were directly linked to China or Russia through flag-state registration or company ownership.Calls for Ireland to boost defence of subsea internet cablesRead moreThe involvement of “shadow fleet” commercial vessels in these incidents is consistent with China and Russia’s broader “grey zone” strategy – a space between war and peace – which aims to coerce adversaries while minimising opportunities for response, the report claims.The patterns of activity – such as the involvement of Chinese vessels in suspicious incidents in the Baltic Sea, and Russian vessels near Taiwan – suggest possible coordination between Moscow and Beijing on undersea cable attacks, it says.It is estimated that up to 99% of intercontinental data transmission takes place through submarine cable systems, playing a vital role in civilian and defence infrastructure. Without undersea cables, much of the economy – from international banking and cloud computing to virtual communications and global logistics – would cease to function.View image in fullscreenA TeleGeography map of undersea internet cables linking the US with the UK and Europe.Photograph: TeleGeographyThe UK acts as a key hub in Euro-Atlantic cable infrastructure and is likely to become a frequent target for future sabotage operations.But a UK government submission to parliament’s joint committee on the national security strategy has admitted that it has limited capabilities to monitor commercial maritime traffic around undersea cables. The joint committee is mounting an investigation into the threat posed to the underseas cables and the possibility of more secure alternatives.The Department for Science, Innovation and Technology submission to the committee noted that “the UK has limited capabilities for monitoring general maritime and white [commercial] shipping traffic, as coastal radar only covers about 22% of the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) around the UK.“The high volume of maritime traffic makes it challenging to identify every instance of abnormal maritime activity. As a result, the current capabilities cannot fully guarantee that all vessels adhere to UK laws and regulations, especially around sensitive infrastructure like undersea cables.”Andrew Yeh, the executive director of CSRI and author of the report, said: “Undersea cables underpin prosperity and security in the digital age. We cannot afford to be naive about the unprecedented threat that China and Russia’s grey-zone operations pose to the UK’s undersea infrastructure.“While well set up to deal with conventional threats, the UK’s defence infrastructure is woefully inadequate in protecting against grey-zone tactics.

The principles remain the same; those who can work should work. Those who need support into work should have that support into work, which I don’t think they are getting at the moment.“Those who are never going to be able to work should be properly supported and protected, and that includes not being reassessed and reassessed. So, they are the principles. We need to do reform and we will be getting on with that reform when the bill comes.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The system is not working. It’s not working for those that need support; it’s not working for taxpayers. Everybody agrees it needs reform. We have got to reform it and that is what we intend to do.”The seemingly tough line follows efforts by ministers to try to reassure possible rebels and, when needed, to warn them against voting down the welfare bill.Some MPs had said there were suggestions the vote could be treated as a confidence issue, with those rebelling facing suspension from the whip or even deselection. No 10 and government sources denied this. But plans have been drawn up for a possible reshuffle if any ministers resign.The biggest sticking points in the plans, first put forward in March in awelfare green paperand intended to save £5bn a year, are the revised rules on Pip, and on benefits for carers.According to a government response to a Liberal Democratparliamentary questionlast month, up to 1.3 million people across England and Wales could lose at least some support under the changes.It showed that under the current proposals, which would come into effect next year, about 1.1 million standard-rate Pip claimants and 200,000 enhanced-rate claimants could lose at least some of the payment.The government data gave statistics by parliamentary constituency, showing the impact in more deprived areas. The constituency with the most people who could lose support was Liverpool Walton, followed by Blackpool South and Liverpool Riverside. About 5,000 people in each area could lose some Pip payments.Explore more on these topicsWelfareBenefitsKeir StarmerLabournewsShareReuse this content"

The United Kingdom is facing threats on an unprecedented scale, be it aggressors who send their spy ships to our waters or hackers whose sophisticated cyber-plots seek to disrupt our public services.”Metreweli, who was made a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George last year, said: “I am proud and honoured to be asked to lead my service. MI6 plays a vital role – with MI5 and GCHQ – in keeping the British people safe and promoting UK interests overseas. I look forward to continuing that work alongside the brave officers and agents of MI6 and our many international partners.”Unlike its sister UK spy agencies, MI6 has never had a female head since it was founded in 1909. MI5 has previously been led by Stella Rimington and Eliza Manningham-Buller, and the current head of GCHQ is Anne Keast-Butler, its first female leader.Metreweli’s appointment is a case of life imitating art. Film buffs will remember Judi Dench’s turn as James Bond’s boss, M, over 17 years of the franchise.By convention the head of MI6 is known internally as C, short for chief, and is the agency’s only officer who is named and publicly acknowledged, gradually adopting a more public profile with occasional speeches and social media postings.Moore’s tenure was due to come to an end shortly. He has served nearly five years in the role, which he took up in September 2020. Five years is the considered maximum term for British spy chiefs, who typically move into consultancy and the private sector.Unlike his successor, who has spent her career inside MI5 and MI6, Moore was a relatively high-profile appointment, having been a diplomat. He spent nearly four years as ambassador to Turkey, where he formed a strong relationship with the country’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

She said the shooting began as people were advancing to the site a few minutes after her arrival.The latest killings of Palestinians near the aid distributions managed by theGazaHumanitarian Foundation (GHF) took place as Tom Fletcher, the UN’s under-secretary general for humanitarian affairs and emergency relief coordinator, warned about the foundation’s operations.He said: “Hunger must never be met with bullets. Humanitarians must be allowed to do their work. Life-saving aid must reach people in need, in line with humanitarian principles.”“Without immediate and massively scaled-up access to the basic means survival, we risk a descent into famine, further chaos and the loss of more lives,” he said.There have been near-daily shootings near the sites since they opened last month. Witnesses say Israeli forces have fired repeatedly on the crowds and health officials say scores of people have been killed. The military has acknowledged firing warning shots at what it says were suspects approaching its forces.In the latest incident, Palestinians said Israeli forces opened fire at about dawn towards crowds of Palestinians heading to two aid sites in Rafah.The attacks in Gaza are taking place as concern mounts that the territory is being forgotten.Thirty-two-year-old Mahmoud Abu Haloub, who has been displaced six times during the war, told the Guardian that the situation in Gaza had worsened since the outbreak of hostilities with Iran last week.He said: “The number of aid trucks has decreased, and there is now greater danger for those who go to receive aid. The Israeli army has become more deadly than before, launching shells and bombs that kill many, without anyone talking about these massacres.”Mohammed Zuhair, from the Beit Lahiya area, said: “The world’s shift of attention toward what is happening with Iran is a disaster for the people of Gaza, especially amid the current famine.“The focus on the Palestinian cause has diminished, and the world has forgotten about us. Our issue has been pushed to the margins while we live through a suffocating crisis under Israeli aggression, blockade, and a lack of food and medicine.”Maryam Al-Shafie, a 65-year-old widow and mother of a family of 12, said: “Yesterday, my grandson went to the aid trucks but came back with nothing. It was his first time, and we won’t let him go again after the massacre took place, and many were killed.“Since the events between Iran and Israel began, it has been a catastrophe for us. The situation has become even more unbearable. We expected the pressure on Gaza to ease, but it only worsened. No one talks about it – all the news is about what’s happening in Iran.”Experts and aid workers say Israel’s blockade and military campaign have caused widespread hunger and raised the risk of famine.The shooting happened hundreds of metres away from the sites, which are operated by the GHF, a group that Israel and the US hope will replace the UN-run system of aid distribution.The UN has rejected the new system, saying it violates humanitarian principles.The aid system rolled out last month has been marred by chaos and violence, while the UN system has struggled to deliver food because of Israeli restrictions and a breakdown of law and order, despite Israel loosening a total blockade it imposed from early March to mid-May.The GHF said there had been no violence in or around the distribution points. It has warned people to stay on the designated routes and recently paused delivery to discuss safety measures with the military.Israel’s military campaign has killed more than 55,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza’s health ministry.Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warGazaIranPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricaIsraelnewsShareReuse this content"

Officials say the aim now is to scale that up, combining forces across regional police, specialist exploitation teams and national units such as Operation Hydrant.The crackdown will also involve the child sexual exploitation taskforce and the tackling organised exploitation programme, working in partnership to strengthen local investigations and improve police handling of abuse cases.The move comes alongside the formal launch of a statutory public inquiry, with powers to compel witnesses and direct local investigations, after a rapid review by Louise Casey concluded a new probe was necessary.The inquiry will scrutinise how institutions – including local councils, police forces and elected officials – failed vulnerable girls across the UK, with a specific focus on mishandled or ignored complaints.It will be able to “compel local deep-dive investigations” into historical cases and demand answers where complaints of wrongdoing or cover-ups have been made, under powers granted by the 2005 Inquiries Act.Yvette Cooper, the home secretary, said survivors of the abuse had been ignored for too long and described the new inquiry as a means to get “truth and justice”.“Not enough people listened to them then. That was wrong and unforgivable. We are changing that now,” she said.The shift follows months of public and political pressure. Labour had previously resisted backing a national inquiry, arguing that years of investigations and reviews – including the independent inquiry into child sexual abuse led by Prof Alexis Jay – had already exposed serious failings.But Starmer appointed Lady Casey earlier this year to revisit the case for further action, and has now accepted all of her recommendations.The inquiry will be chaired by a single figure and report independently, with the power to compel testimony and access to institutional records.Speaking on Sunday, the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, defended the change in position.“The prime minister wanted to assure himself that everything possible was being done,” she told the BBC. “This is about justice – not grandstanding.”But the U-turn has not gone unnoticed. The Reform UK leader, Nigel Farage, has welcomed the move but accused the Labour government of dragging its feet. The Conservative leader, Kemi Badenoch, called on Starmer to apologise for what she described as “six wasted months”.The government had come under growing pressure to shift its stance after senior Conservatives, Farage, campaigners, some victims’ families – and even Elon Musk – said only a full statutory inquiry could deliver accountability.Dan Carden, a Labour backbencher from the party’s Blue Labour wing, was the first to publicly break ranks, urging Starmer to “use the full power of the state”.In January, Tory MPs tabled an amendment to force a vote on establishing such an inquiry – a move that was blocked when Labour joined most MPs in voting it down. At the time, Badenoch accused Labour of risking the perception of a “cover-up”.Pressed on that, Reeves said Labour had always taken the issue seriously. “The Conservatives could have done another national inquiry, but they didn’t. We’ve been focused onimplementing the recommendations of the Alexis Jay reviewand other reviews, because there’s recommendations that have just been sitting on the table.”When asked whether Labour ministers would apologise to campaigners previously dismissed as alarmist, Reeves sidestepped the question. “The most important thing here is the victims. Not people’s hurt feelings,” she said.Officials say the goal is not only to jail more offenders, but to challenge what ministers now describe as a longstanding culture of denial. It is also expected to “strengthen the commitment” to locally led inquiries, with the national chair empowered to oversee their direction.The NCA-led crackdown will run in parallel, targeting known offenders, re-examining cases closed prematurely, and supporting forces to improve how child sexual exploitation is investigated.Cooper added: “More than 800 grooming gang cases have already been identified by police after I asked them to look again at cases which had closed too early.“Now we are asking the National Crime Agency to lead a major nationwide operation to track down more perpetrators and bring them to justice.”Explore more on these topicsCrimePoliceChildrenUK child abuse inquirynewsShareReuse this content"

Not-for-profit models lack one of the negatives of private ownership, dividends, which have contributed to the worsening finances of several water companies, most notablyThames Water.”The committee uncovered in recent weeks that Thames Water executiveshad been paid bonusesworth millions of pounds from a controversial £3bn loan, the purpose of which was to stabilise the company’s finances and save it from collapse.Ministers recently set up anindependent water commissionto produce a report on the future of England’s struggling water industry, which is globally unique in that it is fully privatised and run for profit. Companies have presided over sewage spills and financial mismanagement leading to environmental destruction, a waste of customer money, large bonuses for executives and the risk of companies collapsing and requiring a taxpayer bailout.The Efra committee report is aimed at guiding the commission after months of collecting evidence from experts in the sector.Recommendations from the report include allowing the regulator, Ofwat, to block inappropriate owners from buying water companies and veto the hiring of executives.The government recently passed new laws that allow it to ban bonuses for chief executives, but the report notes that the weak standards currently underpinning this means water bosses who had recently overseen sewage spills were allowed to be paid bonuses. The new law bans performance-related bonuses only, so water companies can get around this by labelling them as something else, for example as retention payments, the report adds.The chair of the Efra committee, the Lib Dem MP Alistair Carmichael, said: “Amidst growing public outrage at the poor performance of water companies, some companies have been paying out high dividends to shareholders and excessive bonuses to their senior executives.“Water companies’ complex and sometimes impenetrable financial structures, with their myriad subsidiaries, holding companies and parent organisations, seem to suggest that their purpose is less to provide a good service to their customers and more to allow them to juggle their finances and their increasingly unsustainable levels of debt.“This has got to stop now. Trust and accountability in the water sector are very low. It is not acceptable that it has fallen to commendable citizen scientists to expose issues with local water resources. Environmental protection and the delivery of a reliable and safe water must be the first priorities of water companies and regulators.”Explore more on these topicsWaterWater industryThames WaterEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

Consider this when working out occupancy.”David Walker, of the Oasis Collectors Group, reportedly said: “To call fans drunk, middle-aged, and fat is a nasty, sneering stereotype, it’s a jaundiced view.”Margaret Graham, the council’s culture and communities convener, told the paper: “We’re very proud to host the biggest and best events in Edinburgh throughout the year, which bring in hundreds of millions of pounds to the local economy and provide unparalleled entertainment for our residents and visitors.“As with any major event which takes place in the city, we prepare extensively alongside our partners to ensure the safety and best possible experience of everyone involved – and Oasis are no different.”She added: “We’re all looking forward to seeing Oasis take to the stage this August and I’m sure that they’ll ‘live forever’ as some of the most memorable concerts ever performed at Murrayfield.”Explore more on these topicsLiam GallagherOasisEdinburghScotlandLocal governmentnewsShareReuse this content"

She will be deeply missed and will leave an everlasting impression on all those she has met in life.”Taylor’s partner, Scott Armstrong, wrote on social media on Sunday: “I want answers. Today, they took my world away.”He added: “I miss you so much, you were my best friend, thank you for everything you [have] done for me. From making my children feel at home to putting up with my mess.”The identity of the other skydiver who died has not yet been disclosed.The chief executive of British Skydiving, Robert Gibson, expressed his deepest condolences to the victims’ families, friends and the entire skydiving community. He added that a British Skydiving board of inquiry would investigate.He said: “Once complete, a report – setting out the board’s conclusions and any recommendations – will be submitted to the coroner, the police, the CAA [Civil Aviation Authority], the British Skydiving Safety and Training Committee and any other relevant authorities.”Devon and Cornwall police said on Sunday that officers remained at the scene and that inquiries by relevant agencies were continuing.The force said: “If anyone has information which may assist us, please call 101 or report via ourwebsitequoting 50250150193.”Explore more on these topicsDevonEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

You always think this country has the resources and money to ensure things like that don’t happen, Kensington and Chelsea is one of the richest boroughs in the world. But it did happen, with devastating consequences.”View image in fullscreenTheresa May in Grenfell: Uncovered.Photograph: Courtesy of NetflixMay is forthcoming in the film – she repeats her previous assertion thatshe will “always regret” not meeting survivorsof the blaze when she first visited the site.It was a surprisingly “open” conversation for Sadiq, who said she was “very clear” about the purposes of her documentary. “May was on board with it. Regardless of how you feel about her as a former PM, it was brave of her to sit down and own what she wanted to own.”Survivors, the bereaved and the firefighters deployed on the night speak of their disbelief at how the fire could have spread so quickly – within mere minutes, because the cladding materials and insulation were so flammable.The documentary details the institutional failures at theLondonfire brigade and the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea. It reminds us of David Cameron’s wider government policy to relax laws and regulations, despite the risks this posed.It also refers to documents Sadiq and Netflix uncovered through a court process, including emails between staff members at Arconic, the multibillion-dollar US company that made the combustible cladding panels on the the tower.“I always felt like I knew a lot about Grenfell, but I gained a newfound knowledge through making this, including just how avoidable it all was,” Sadiq said. “There’s so much my eyes are open to now, and I want other people to watch this and feel the same. The Grenfell story should make us all uncomfortable. And to this day it remains unresolved.”View image in fullscreenTwo of the interviewees in Grenfell: Uncovered, Bernie Bernard and Jackie Leger.Photograph: Courtesy of NetflixLast September, Sir Martin Moore-Bick’s report on the causes of the firehighlighted the incompetence, dishonesty and greed that made the blaze possible.It said the key companies involved – Arconic, Celotex and Kingspan – had engaged in “deliberate and sustained strategies to manipulate the testing processes, misrepresent test data and mislead the market”.The companies all issued statements to the effect that they did not accept the findings of the inquiry, and they also denied Sadiq’s requests for comment in the new documentary. As did the former housing secretary and Tory peer Eric Pickles, who Moore-Bick said hadfailed to act on a coroner’s 2013 recommendationto tighten fire safety regulations after a similar, fatal fire at another London council block.“The survivors and bereaved want accountability, they want criminal prosecutions,” Sadiq said. “They joke that they want the police to watch this. As do I. How has no one been arrested yet? The lack of justice is incredibly upsetting for everyone.”One bereaved person even showed Sadiq a photograph of how they received the remains of their loved one, an image the director said stayed in her head for a long time. “You underestimate just how harrowing Grenfell was.”If there’s anything Sadiq hopes will come from the film, it’s the acceleration of “real change”, including the removal of dangerous claddingwhich remains on thousands of buildings across the UK.She added: “I really hope that it helps survivors push for accountability. That it ignites conversations about our society, and the systemic issues that exist in this country.”Explore more on these topicsGrenfell Tower fireNetflixLondonTelevisionGrenfell Tower inquiryTheresa MayinterviewsShareReuse this content"

An Israeli bomb hit a building nearby – she could not see where – and soon her house began to fill up with smoke. It was the third day of Israeli bombing of Iran and the situation in Tehran was just getting worse.“This is a massacre. The blasts haven’t stopped. Children are crying and we fear many civilians have been killed. There’s a smell of death in the air. I can’t stop crying,” Nahid*, a 25-year-old finance analyst at an e-commerce company in Tehran, told the Guardian via text.Residents began to flee Tehran and head towards the countryside on Sunday as Israeli attacks on the Iranian capital escalated, with bombs raining down on residential and government buildings alike. Authorities gave no official death toll, but at least 138 people have been killed and hundreds wounded by strikes onIransince Friday.View image in fullscreenA man carries a wounded child after an Israeli airstrike in central Tehran on Sunday.Photograph: Abedin Taherkenareh/EPAThe bombing started early on Friday morning when Israel launched hundreds of strikes in what it said was an operation aimed at preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. Iran quickly responded with a barrage of ballistic missiles and has continued to hit Israel, killing 10 people, including three children, in strikes on residential buildings on Saturday night.As the conflict continued to escalate, Iranian authorities announced they would open Tehran’s metro stations and schools to use as shelters.Map of strikes on Israel and Iran“Unfortunately, we in Tehran and in other cities do not have shelters,” said Mehdi Chamran, the chair of the city council, as he urged civilians to use tunnels and basements as makeshift bomb shelters.The ferocity of the Israeli assault caught Iran’s citizens and government by surprise, as Israel’s jets flew with virtual freedom over Iranian skies. While Iranian missiles flew towards Israel, its military seemed incapable of stopping Israeli attacks.“We are not confident mosques, schools or metro stations will be safe. What if we get buried under? My sisters and I are going to urge my parents and neighbours to leave home,” Nahid said.View image in fullscreenInjured people are assisted in the street after an explosion in central Tehran.Photograph: Amir Kholousi/APThere were scenes of chaos on Tehran’s streets as residents rushed to buy food amid bombings before shops shut.“People are running around in the streets and screaming. It’s extremely dangerous to step outside now but we don’t have an option,” said Reza*, a student at the University of Tehran. The 21-year-old described long lines at petrol stations as he and others filled their cars before making the journey out of the city.While residents queued for fuel, or for cash at ATMs, a sense of panic began to spread as the strikes were joined by car-bombings, reportedly targeting Iranian nuclear scientists. People struggled to contact their loved ones as Iran’s mobile phone network failed, giving only sporadic coverage.View image in fullscreenIranians queue with their vehicles at a petrol station after Israeli strikes on Tehran.Photograph: Abedin Taherkenareh/EPAExperts said Israel’s attack had come at a critical point for the Iranian government, which has been rocked by protests in recent years and by a deepening economic crisis.“This war comes at a most acute situation domestically, because we have the gravest economic crisis for decades,” said Dr Ali Fathollah-Nejad, the founder and director of the Center for Middle East and Global Order.Prices of food and other essential goods have rocketed over the past year as the Iran’s currency, the rial, rapidly depreciated. Trump quickly signed an executive order after retaking office in January that tightened sanctions against Iran, choking off oil exports from the already beleaguered economy.View image in fullscreenSmoke from an oil refinery rises over residential buildings in southern Tehran after Israeli airstrikes.Photograph: Abedin Taherkenareh/EPAFathollah-Nejad said the economic crisis had been one of the key factors alongside military pressure that pushed the Iranian government towards diplomacy with the US, with which ithad been negotiatingover its nuclear programme for the past couple of months.Iranians took to social media to mock the government’s lack of preparedness, sharing videos of top military officials saying Israel would never dare to attack Iran. Officials had previously trumpeted Iran’s ability to deter strikes through its fierce military capabilities.Within Iran, state TV replayed footage of Iranian strikes on Israel and played down the impact of Israeli attacks. The feeling of being under attack has prompted a sense of unity among some Iranians.View image in fullscreenThe Israeli strikes have prompted a sense of unity among some Iranians.Photograph: Morteza Nikoubazl/NurPhoto/Shutterstock“We have been hearing the rumours of regime change, especially by the Israelis and Americans. It seems more like a joke,” said Hadi*, a Tehran resident in his 60s.He added that among his friends, those who were initially against Iran developing nuclear weapons now felt the country needed an atomic arsenal to defend itself from Israel.“Many Iranians may criticise the government and object to the strategies, but history has proven that Iranians unite when attacked by a foreign country,” Hadi said.* Some names have been changedExplore more on these topicsIranMiddle East and north AfricaIsraelfeaturesShareReuse this content"

There were parents coming back for their children’s graduation – we’re both students, it really hit hard.”Gujarati communitiesin the capitaland other cities including Leicesterhave been gatheringsince the crash to commemorate the more than 270 people who died in the crash in Ahmedabad, one of the worst air accidents in Indian history.‘They were my everything’: tributes paid as names of more British Air India crash victims emergeRead moreThere have been remarkable stories, such as the Bristol student whomissed the flight because she was held up in trafficand the miraculous taleof the sole survivor, Vishwash Kumar Ramesh. But the details of the lives lost –ambitions and hopesextinguished in an instant – all add to the sense of shock among British-Indians.“We needed somewhere to mourn,” said Mayur Shikotra, who organised the vigil alongsidePranav Bhanot.Bhanot said: “We’re only a small community, many people are only one or two degrees away from the tragedy,. There aren’t that many flights that come out of Gujarat directly, so it really could have been anyone. That makes it hit home.”Much has been made of the close-knit nature of the Gujarati community in the UK, a fact that has made the traumapersonal for many.Narendra Thakerar was among a group of old schoolfriends with Gujarati backgrounds who decided to come and remember those who lost their lives.“I’ve flown three times in the last six months with Air India,” he said. “It’s a tragedy that no one prepares for, it’s humbling and just a reminder about how fragile we are.”Bhanot said: “It’s really important that we find out what happened, we need the bodies repatriated and hopefully some compensation for loved ones – it’s never going to bring anyone back but it’d be a recognition of what happened and the loss of life.”‘They were inseparable’: family’s anguish at wait to bring Air India victims homeRead moreAs well as grief, there was a desire forBoeing, the manufacturer of the aircraft, to be held accountable if it was at fault.“My first thought is the Boeing 787,” said Thakerar, who is glad the fleet is being inspected by the Indian governmentafter the disaster.Another member of the group, Mahesh Patel, said: “The problem is when you’re dealing with old planes that have been sold and resold and used and used.”There are more than 1,100 787s in service, with most major international airlines using them and its safety record in service has been good.Tata Group bought Air India from the Indian government in 2022 and announced plans last year to revamp and upgrade its fleet.“None of us want this to happen again so there needs to be a thorough investigation,” Thakerar said.Explore more on these topicsAir India Ahmedabad plane crashBoeingIndiaPlane crashesAirline industrySouth and central AsiafeaturesShareReuse this content"

Archive image: courtesy of Kathy LetteBorn in 1958 in Sydney, Kathy Lette burst on to Australia’s literary scene in 1979 with Puberty Blues. Co‑written with Gabrielle Carey, the irreverent portrait of teenage girlhood became a cult classic, a film and a TV series. Relocating to London in the 1980s, Lette has worked as a columnist, television writer and campaigner, and has published a string of bestselling comic novels. She lives in London and has two children, Julius and Georgina, with her former husband, the human rights lawyer Geoffrey Robertson. Her latest novel,The Revenge Club, is out now.When I was 19, I was in a band called theSalami Sisters.As well as the occasional gig in a pub, we’d busk. The problem was, we kept getting arrested. I was furious. How come we were getting arrested for singing, when actual rapists were running free? My sister was a police constable at the time, so one day I borrowed – stole, really – her uniform and went out busking, performing send-up songs about the police. Fortunately, I didn’t get arrested for impersonating an officer. I’m a woman with the courage of my convictions, but I don’t particularly want to go to prison. Mainly I just wanted to blow some raspberries at the police, which I happily did.Before busking, I was a surfy girl who spent a lot of time with surfy boys. While their blond hair, blue eyes and incredible ice-cream cone physiques were beautiful, they were emotional bonsai. You had to put fertiliser on them to get any feeling out. They were incredibly sexist, too – all brawn and no brain. So by the time I was 16, I was over good-looking guys and obsessed with creative geniuses instead. Specifically, Spike Milligan. I loved his books – Puckoon, Adolf Hitler: My Part in His Downfall – and knew all of his poetry by heart.When I got news he was touring Australia with a one-man show, I ran away from school, to the horror of my mother, who was a headmistress. Along with my girlfriend, we hitchhiked across the country, relying on the kindness of passing serial killers to get us from Adelaide to Melbourne to Canberra. I would wait for Spike in hotel foyers, and bombard him with poetry and songs. He couldn’t get rid of me, and in the end adopted me. He even wrote it on the back of an envelope: “I, Spike Milligan, adopt Kathy Lette as my unofficial daughter.” I was crazy in love with him, and he could have easily taken advantage of that, but he didn’t. It was love from the neck up, and often a little like having a sugar daddy, without the sex: me and my girlfriend were sleeping rough at the time, so he’d put us up in hotel rooms.Whether it’s puberty, motherhood or menopause, I always write the book I wish I’d had when I was going through itSpike was always adorable, but some days he was so blue. If I could go back to that time, I’d try to talk to him about his depression. Perhaps I could have helped him, in exchange for all his kindness to me. Instead, on the days he was down, I’d sing to him. Sometimes that would depress him even more, other times I like to think it jolted him out of sadness.Spike was the first adult who took me seriously as a writer.At that tender age, all a writer craves is reassurance. I’d been sending my work to publishers for more than a year and received a whole forest of rejection letters in the form of patronising put‑downs from Conan the Grammarians – those men who’ve been at university for so long they’ve got ivy growing up the backs of their legs. Spike was their antithesis. Thanks to his encouragement, I wrote Puberty Blues. The book became a huge success and, much to my amazement, around the time this photo was taken, I went from overnight nonentity to overnight notoriety. It was quite a rollercoaster ride.A lot of parents banned their kids from reading it because it was about the sexist brutality of surfy culture and sexual initiations – in fact, Kylie Minogue, who is a friend of mine, says she read it secretly in bed at night with a torch. My mother only recently told me how many death threats and anonymous phone calls she got saying, “You call yourself a teacher when you’ve raised a slut like that?” Luckily, she didn’t tell me at the time. I would have been devastated.I have come to realisethatthere is nothing more powerful than a girls’night out.Swinging off a chandelier with a cocktail between your teeth is cheaper and more fun than therapy. Without it, without your girlfriends, you can lose your identity. The closest I came to feeling like that was when I had my first baby. I was walking through Harrods with my mum, saying, “I think I’m back – I feel like I’m getting my brain back.” I proceeded to pick up a perfume spray and spritzed it on my neck. After walking around the entire department store, I realised it was actually white foam and I was covered in it. She said, “Not quite back yet, darling.”Whether it’s puberty, motherhood or menopause, I always write the book I wish I’d had when I was going through it. The only time I didn’t do this was with my son. He is autistic, and I didn’t want to invade his privacy, so I didn’t write about him until he was 21 and had given me permission to. I regret that in a way, because it’s always better to shine a light into a dark corner than to ignore it. Seeing the positive joys of neurodiversity, and seeing the stigma taken out of autism, is so wonderful, but that’s only because people talk about it now.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

In fact, all the publishers I approached with The Revenge Club said, “Nobody wants to read about middle-aged women.” One publisher even said to me, “Middle-aged women are like Sudan or Mogadishu. We know they exist, but nobody wants to go there.” I kept thinking, “But all of my women friends have such an incredible hinterland. They’ve had divorces, breakups, promotions, betrayals, affairs, breakdowns, and have so much wisdom and wit. Who wouldn’t want to read that?” It turns out I was right, because the book was a bestseller.When you get to 50, a man becomes a silver fox, whereas a woman is a hag, a bag and a crone. There’s a cloak of invisibility just when we enter the peak of our productivity. I am 66 now, and always say to women: have a sensational second act. You are in your prime, even if society says you’re not. You’re in your sexual prime, as well. But don’t necessarily go for an alpha male. I’ve realised – as an alpha – I need a beta. Which I have. He is a classical guitarist, who adores me. He cooks, he cleans. He is nurturing and kind and happy. I’ve had two alphas now – two fantastic ex‑husbands – but it’s lovely to be taken care of.In so many ways I feel this is the best time of my life.There’s so much to look forward to, plus no period cramps, no pregnancy scares, and all that tampon money to spend. I make sure to do something outrageous every day – tonight I’m wearing a tiny black miniskirt and black boots to a party. It’s not escaping the law by any means, but it’s one small way to go forth and be fabulous.Explore more on these topicsFamilyFlashbackWomenChick litComedyPhotographyMenopausefeaturesShareReuse this content"

He’s a similar age to my dad, my elder, and I respect his opinions and life experience. He makes me feel cared for and listened to. Sometimes he reads to me or shows me classic films that his parents introduced him to. He’s my best friend, my lover and a father figure.We met on an online forum when I replied to his question asking if the British Wildlife Centre was a good date idea. We shared contact details, and I quickly opened up to him. I’d been in an abusive relationship in my late teens and hadn’t had sex, or even dated, in the six years after that. The first time I went to his house, I was terrified but excited. Jeremy was adamant we weren’t going to have sex, but I wanted to show him my body, so I stripped for him. It felt incredible to be touched after so long. We began meeting weekly to have sex when his partner was out.Jeremy made it clear from the beginning that he was in a polyamorous relationship; we can talk to each other about anything, and there’s no judgment. My parents are conservative Muslims, so I’ve never been able to confide in them or ask them for advice. The emotional intimacy we lack, I quickly found with Jeremy. I call him my “cool dad”. But, in the beginning, I felt a lot of guilt, as if I was doing something wrong.Jeremy doesn’t need to come to experience pleasure, so there’s more emphasis on more on how we connect emotionallyOur relationship is open, and I’ve been seeing someone else for six months, but he doesn’t know about Jeremy. I used to tell the people I was dating, but those relationships didn’t last, and I found that being poly shrinks your dating pool.Sex with Jeremy is completely different to the sex I had before. It’s gentle, loving and mutual. My ex was a porn addict, which shaped the sex we had, whereas Jeremy doesn’t watch porn. To have good sex, I now think it needs to be with someone who doesn’t watch porn and who has erectile dysfunction, which takes the pressure off penetration. Jeremy doesn’t need to get hard or come to experience pleasure, so there’s less emphasis on making either of us orgasm and more on how we connect emotionally.Jeremy, 54I also don’t experience jealousy. But I can feel insecure. I worry about being left for a monogamous relationshipBeing polyamorous, I’ve been with about 40 people, but at the time I met Laila, I wasn’t expecting to meet anyone new. She came out of the blue.The age gap means she doesn’t really feel like my girlfriend. My primary partner, with whom I’ve lived for more than 13 years, is like my wife (though we’re not married), whereas with Laila it’s very different. One of the reasons I’m polyamorous is to have different dynamics with different people. For me, there would be no point in having the same feelings for another person that I already have for someone else.One of the reasons I’m polyamorous is to have different types of relationships, different dynamics with different peopleIn the same way that parents can love their children equally, I don’t have a limited supply for my romantic partners. I also don’t experience jealousy. But I can feel insecure. I worry about being left for a monogamous relationship, which has happened previously. Last year, Laila was seeing a man she said was like me, which made me think she could get the same thing from someone better than me, younger than me.I’m slightly disabled – I have advanced arthritis and a long-term back injury – so we can only have sex with Laila on top. I have problems with impotence, but Laila likes it when I don’t get fully hard. She also likes older, plump men (I have a 42in waist).Sex with Laila is magical, almost spiritual. There’s a very intense emotional quality to the sex we have. Sometimes we take psychedelics or MDMA, which increases the intensity, physically and emotionally. We feel extraordinarily close and in love. Laila comes over about once a week. We spend hours in bed kissing. I lost my job a few years ago, so sometimes I go into town and meet Laila on her lunch break, and we’ll just sit on a bench and kiss.Explore more on these topicsLife and styleThis is how we do itSexRelationshipsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Sure, they might not be the real thing – but they’re close enough.Tribute acts – the artists who make their living performing covers of well-known musicians – are not new. But in the past few years they’ve surged in popularity – even while Australia’s live music industryhas struggled– as audiences embrace nostalgia more than ever before. RSLs and regional towns might be the stomping ground for tribute acts but today the best in the business can charge more than $100 a ticket.So who are some of the biggest tribute acts in Australia, and what drives them? We meet four to find out.Bjorn Again: ‘I said, I don’t really like Abba’View image in fullscreenBjorn Again perform at Melbourne’s Sidney Myer Music Bowl in 2024.Photograph: Dara MunnisBjorn Again, the world’s biggestAbbatribute act, have played gigs most artists only ever dream of. They’ve done Glastonbury three times and graced hallowed venues such as Wembley Stadium and the Sydney Opera House. They perform 300 and 400 times a year, and have toured about 120 countries.But as co-founder John Tyrell sees it, the truest sign of the group’s success is the celebrites they attract.“Dave Grohl is our biggest fan,” he says. “Rowan Atkinson has booked us for his parties. JK Rowling’s been to a gig. Russell Crowe booked us for his wedding. We’ve played Money, Money, Money to Bill Gates at a Microsoft function in LA – I could just go on and on.”To meet the level of demand, Bjorn Again has more than one line-up on staff to play the Swedish superstars and it operates offices in London and Melbourne. Shows sell out quickly. As Tyrell puts it: “We could do a gig on the moon.”Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morningAmplified review – loving but uneven musical tribute to the Divinyls’ Chrissy AmphlettRead moreBut this global success story wasn’t born – or, ahem, Bjorn – out of a great love for Abba’s music. In 1988, Tyrell and his friend Rod Stephen were playing in bands around Melbourne. But when their bands failed to take off, Stephen had the idea for an Abba cover act: he thought it would be funny and something different from other gigs on the market – and a way to meet all the girls they’d have to audition.“I said, ‘I don’t really like Abba,’” Tyrell remembers. “And he said, ‘I don’t either, but that’s not the point.’”They couldn’t have imagined they’d still be doing it more than 35 years later. Tyrell stopped playing in the band 10 years ago and now works behind the scenes, but he still loves the job because “you just never know who will ring up wanting us for a gig”.View image in fullscreenBjorn Again performing in Sydney last year.Photograph: Dara MunnisA case in point is their most famous – or infamous – fan: Vladimir Putin, whobooked the group for a private showin Moscow in 2009. The gig was booked through their UK office, so Tyrell didn’t learn about it until after the fact – when he woke up to 80 missed calls from journalists.It was a different time in geopolitics then, he says. “I don’t think he had invaded anywhere [yet].” But recent events have somewhat soured that momentous booking: “Since the Ukraine thing, we’ve taken it off our website.”Despite Bjorn Again’s lucrative global success, Tyrell says it’s enjoyment of the job that keeps him going. “We are not driven by money,” he says. “We were just doing it for fun. But it’s been insanely successful.”The Dolly Show: ‘I studied her laugh on repeat over and over, just so I have it right’View image in fullscreenKelly O’Brien performing the Dolly Show. She plays between 75 and 100 gigs a yearKelly O’Brien admits she looks “nothing like Dolly Parton”. It’s true – out of costume, the only trace of the Australian-born, UK-based performer’s alter ego is her long acrylic nails. That, and her height – she’s exactly five feet, just like the real Dolly.But for the past 18 years, O’Brien has been doing a bang-up job of looking like Parton when she takes to the stage in The Dolly Show. It hasn’t come easy – as Parton once famously said, it takes a lot of money to look this cheap.When O’Brien first decided to become a Dolly Parton tribute act in 2007, she took out a £10,000 loan to buy “big prosthetic boobs”, wigs, makeup, nails, costumes and custom-made corsets. It takes two hours to doll up, and every show has six costume changes, which, done hastily on stage, are “like two pigs fighting under a blanket”. Off stage, O’Brien adheres to a strict ketogenic diet to stay as tiny as the real Parton.The commitment has paid off: O’Brien “now gets paid extremely well for what I do” and she was recently chosen by the real Dolly Parton to beone of 15 finalists in contention to play the singerin a Broadway show about her life.O’Brien’s road to Dolly began many years ago. A gifted singer, by age 12 she had begun entering country music competitions in her home state of South Australia. It wasn’t that she was particularly enamoured with the genre, she just liked the attention and the chance to win easy money. For one competition, she dressed up as Parton “and everyone lost their minds”, which sealed her future. She now plays between 75 and 100 gigs a year.But her costume wasn’t the only thing O’Brien had to master. When she started out, she spent three months studying every video of Parton she could find so she could convincingly imitate the star’s mannerisms. And the work is never done.“She’s written more than 3,000 songs – I’m always learning another one,” O’Brien says. “I’ve learned to play the guitar with these nails; the banjo, the harmonica, the tambourine. The stories, the anecdotes, the Dolly-isms, the way she moves … I studied her laugh on repeat over and over, just so I have it right. I want people to think when I’m on stage – as they do – that I’m her.”Her shows attract Dolly diehards of all kinds.As well as the paycheque, what keeps O’Brien coming back is the feedback she gets from audiences – such as the woman who told her she’d experienced a miscarriage, but listening to her performance of Light of a Clear Blue Morning made her feel, for the first time, that everything would be OK.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSaved for LaterFree newsletterCatch up on the fun stuff with Guardian Australia's culture and lifestyle rundown of pop culture, trends and tipsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The group performs six shows a week in Las Vegas and has four full line-ups, allowing them to play in different parts of the world at the same time. “We’ve franchised, if you like,” says Michael Clift, the man behind this very global operation.Clift and his bandmates came up with the idea to put a Bee Gees cover act together in 1996 to bring in extra money while they worked on original music. Back then, tribute acts were few and far between – and Bee Gees fans were “fairly standoffish”, unsure if Clift and co were mocking their beloved heroes.Before the internet, it was a lot harder to research the ins and outs of an act, or even see them perform. Clift would drive to record stores and secondhand shops around Melbourne to rustle together the band’s back catalogue.But he was determined. A great tribute act has to capture the essence of what fans love about an artist, he says – not just the music but the “finer details” of the group’s mannerisms, outfits and speech.“We went to huge lengths to look like the Bee Gees – prosthetic teeth, wigs, makeup, you name it,” Clift says. “To me, it was all about getting those details right. If you’re watching Kurt Russell playing Elvis, you don’t want to be thinking all night [if] it’s Kurt Russell you’re watching. You need to be able to suspend your disbelief.”It took a lot of work and time, but “it definitely paid off”, Clift says. They convinced a Vegas casino to give them a residency and 14 years later proudly count themselves as part of what they estimate is the 5% of tribute acts who work full-time.But despite Clift’s success, the most dangerous thing a tribute act can do is get comfortable, he says: “We’ve been doing it for nearly 30 years. But a new [act] could pop up tomorrow that’s beautifully produced and full of talented people. You don’t have any rights, you’re playing someone else’s music … so if someone else starts doing it better, you have to let it go.”The Australian Bee Gees Showis touring the US and Australia this yearDreams: ‘People were like, are you sure you want to do that?’View image in fullscreenWayne Daniels and Annette Zavesa in Dreams, a Fleetwood Mac and Stevie Nicks tribute bandThere are at least sevenFleetwood Mactribute acts in Australia but Dreams, who ticked off 76 shows last calendar year, is perhaps the busiest.Behind the operation is Wayne Daniels, a longtime musician who founded the act in 2016. An old friend, who then managed a golf club, needed a show for Sunday afternoons at the venue and asked Daniels to find something to fill the slot. He slapped together a Fleetwood Mac cover show – and enjoyed the experience so much that he decided to keep doing it.“I knew there were quite a few other Fleetwood Mac cover bands around, but I really wanted to do it for myself because Rumours is in my blood,” he says, referring to one of the band’s most successful albums.Not everyone was convinced. “People were saying, ‘A lot of people are doing [Fleetwood Mac covers shows] – are you sure you want to do that? How popular can it be?” Daniels says, down the line from Redcliffe Entertainment Centre, where his band is getting ready to play to a sold-out crowd of 400. “And look where we are today.”Women have been key to the show’s success. They love Stevie Nicks and drive ticket sales. That’s why it’s crucial they have a performer on stage who looks like the real deal. Daniels, who serves as the group’s musical director but also steps into the role of Lindsey Buckingham, admits he looks nothing like the real Lindsey. “But that doesn’t matter – I can be the one who doesn’t look like him, because I started the band,” he says. “And in all honesty, when we’re performing, all eyes are on the girls.”Dreams Show now has its own fans, the most devoted of whom have seen the show “10 to 15 times”, Daniels says. “They come again and again and again, and they bring back their shirts for us to sign”. Not Fleetwood Mac shirts – Dreams Show shirts. (The band also sell hats and, because “we are in Australia”, stubby coolers.)Despite the number of Fleetwood Mac tribute acts out there, Daniels isn’t fazed by the competition. “Good luck to them,” he says. “Whatever keeps the music alive is a good thing.”The Dreams Fleetwood Mac and Stevie Nicks Showis playing around Australia for the rest of the yearExplore more on these topicsMusicAbbaDolly PartonBee GeesFleetwood MacAustralian musicfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Somewhere, through a loudspeaker, an officer delivered a tinny order to disperse.Tolokonnikova was only three and a half days into what was supposed to be a “durational performance” reenacting her two years as a political prisoner in Vladimir Putin’s Russia.But Donald Trump had ordered national guard troops intoLos Angeles, over the objections of California’s governor, and the protests against immigration raids that Trump wanted to target were happening just a block from the gallery where Tolokonnikova was performing.The Museum of ContemporaryArt(Moca) hastily decided to shut its doors. But Tolokonnikova, 35, whose political art has left her as a wanted criminal in Russia, chose to continue her performance inside the empty museum.“Police State Exhibit Closed Today Due to the Police State,” she posted on Instagram.The situation “felt like I had entered a wormhole,” Tolokonnikova told the Guardian the next day via email. She wanted to be out on the streets, but she decided to finish her performance while live-streaming audio of the protests outside into her prison cell. It felt important, she wrote, “not to bend to the whims of Ice or the national guard”.Tolokonnikova was in Los Angeles to display a new performance piece called Police State, which includes a replica Russian prison cell like the ones in which she was incarcerated for nearly two years, including in the notoriouspenal colony IK-14in Mordovia. Tolokonnikova had been just 22 when she and two other members of Pussy Riot were convicted of “hooliganism motivated by religious hatred” for staging an anti-Putin “Punk Prayer” protest in a Moscow cathedral in early 2012.After her release in late 2013, she kept demonstrating, and kept making art. In 2021, the Russian government labeled her a “foreign agent”. A recent multimedia performance,Putin’s Ashes,whichcame to Los Angeles in 2023, had landed her on Russia’s wanted list, and led to her beingarrested in absentiafor the crime of “insulting the religious feelings of believers”.View image in fullscreenDonald Trump deployed the national guard to Los Angeles over the governor’s objections.Photograph: David Ryder/ReutersLos Angeles was the latest stop in a series of museum exhibitions that had brought the artist toBerlinand Linz in Austria for a show called Wanted. Police State, which was being performed at the Geffen Contemporary at Moca, had been designed for an audience, with museum visitors peering at her through observation holes in the walls, or following the surveillance video from her cell on gallery screens. It was her first time doing a “durational” performance, and she had planned to spend hours each day inside the cell creating music, mixing it with leaked audio from Russian prisons, and sewing protest slogans on military shirts, all the while surrounded by a crowd of supportive people outside the fake cell walls.Now, suddenly, she was alone again. A block away, protesters had gathered outside the federal buildings where detained immigrants, including families with small children, were reportedly beingheld in basements, with little food or water.In her replica cell, Tolokonnikova thought about the Los Angeles mothers and fathers who had just been torn away from their families, people who were “hard-working breadwinners and caretakers”, not violent gang members. She looked at the art decorating her cell’s walls, drawings sent by current and former political prisoners in Russia and Belarus, “people imprisoned for 10, 15, 20 years, simply for being good”.“I was thinking of dehumanization and scapegoating as a universal mechanism – applied with heartbreaking ruthlessness both back home and here,” she wrote in the email. “I was thinking how the western idea that history inevitably moves toward progress is a mirage.”View image in fullscreenNadya Tolokonnikova’s Police State installation.Photograph: Yulia Shur/MocaWhen her performance hours were done, she walked out into the Los Angeles streets for comfort. It was early Sunday evening, and the protests downtown had been going on most of the afternoon. “People were giving out gas masks, water, and protective glasses,” she wrote. What captured her attention was not moments that would be played and replayed on the news, like Waymo automated vehicles set on fire, or protesters streaming on to the 101 highway. It was the way being at a protest feels: “That spirit of care and solidarity is precious,” she wrote. “People were being shot with rubber bullets and burned by tear gas, yet they refused to leave.”On Wednesday, the museum announced that the rest of Tolokonnikova’s performance would have to be postponed indefinitely, because of “ongoing demonstrations and military activity”.“Every single event I did in Russia was shut down by the cops,” she posted on Instagram, “and now it’s starting to feel a lot like Russia.”‘Now I just want to comfort people’Tolokonnikova, who facesimmediate arrestif she returns to Russia, is not an optimist. In recent months, she hasrepeatedly comparedher art practice to the musicians who kept playing on the Titanic as the ship went down.“I think we live in a world that doesn’t really belong to us any more,” she told me in an interview the week before her Los Angeles performance began. “If 15 years ago, I wanted to radically change the world, now I just want to comfort people.”“I mean, I still wouldn’t mind changing the world,” she added. But at the moment, the change she’s seeing “goes in the opposite direction”.Still, Tolokonnikova, 35, does not take her ability to keep making big art installations for granted.“It’s awesome,” she told me in our Los Angeles interview, as she and her collaborators were working on the final touches to her replica prison cell. “I don’t know if victory is the right word, but it’s rewarding.”We need to be ready to offend ourselves and other people. Otherwise, Maga people are just going to keep winningNadya TolokonnikovaWhen I walked inside the replica cell, it was bigger and far more detailed than I expected, with battered, blue-painted plaster walls etched with graffiti, a desk for Tolokonnikov’s music equipment, and a toilet in the corner that she planned to use during her performance shifts, which would last either six or eight hours. The floor of the cell was dirty, and the observation holes fit into the walls had heavy metal covers that could slide open or closed. There were surveillance cameras all over the cell, even one pointed at the toilet.The Russian prisons where she was incarcerated had “cameras right above the toilet bowl, which makes no sense for us people who live outside of jails”, she said. “But once you’re in, you kind of just know, well, that’s what it is.”We talked with the noise of construction around us, and the sharp smell of iron in the air, a sign of the metalwork in progress nearby. Partway through our conversation, the metalworker approached, wheeling the massive cell door, to ask Tolokonnikova about the finish she wanted on the metal.Each of these details mattered to Tolokonnikova. One of her inspirations for the durational prison performance is her friend Marina Abramović, known as “the grandmother of performance art”. Another is thelate conceptual artist Ilya Kabakov, who hadmeticulously replicatedan old, deteriorating Sovietpublic bathroomand displayed it in a European gallery so western audiences could understand the context of his art. “It’s one of the works that changed my life for ever,” she said.For authenticity, the table in her cell was covered with a garish plastic tablecloth printed with lemons, a “very post-Soviet thing” that people incarcerated in Russia use “to recreate this idea of comfort of coziness, in jail”.To more directly connect her performance to other political prisoners still incarcerated in Russia, Tolokonnikova had collected drawings they had made to display in the cell. This was a laborious process, she explained, working with the prisoners’ family members and lawyers, and some of the art had not yet arrived. But she was hopeful that displaying Russian prisoners’ work in a prestigious American museum might help their cases, even help them get on a prisoner exchange list.Tolokonnikova and another jailed member of Pussy Riot, Maria Alyokhina,staged hunger strikesanddrew international attentionto the conditions in their different prisons.View image in fullscreenA detail from ‘Police State’.Photograph: Yulia Shur/MocaWhen she was incarcerated in prison colony No 14 in the Russian region of Mordovia, Tolokonnikova was forced to work 16-hour days, seven days a week, sewing uniforms for police officers. The sewing machine she had used in prison had constantly broken down, something she believes was not a coincidence: the prison staff wanted to make her life “completely impossible”.A decade later, in her reenactment of prison life, Tolokonnikova was planning to again sew military-style uniforms on a battered old sewing machine, but this time she would be embellishing them with “some simple words that mean something to me like exiled or voided, cancelled, expelled, alien – how I feel these days'”. She would trim some of the uniforms with lace, she added, “because I always like to add some cuteness”.Danger for Russian dissidentsThe lives of Russian dissidents are not easy, and becoming a prominent Putin critic, as Tolokonnikova has done, is dangerous, even after dissidents have left Russia. One of the art works in Tolokonnikova’s Los Angeles exhibit is a candy machine labeled with the different poisons that have been used to murder enemies of the Russian state: Polonium 210 Isotope, Thallium, Sarin.On certain subjects, Tolokonnikovia can be laconic, even dismissive. Asked about how she was preparing to protect her mental health while reenacting her imprisonment in Los Angeles, she said she had not really made any plans. “Self-care is not my strong suit. I’m just like: I don’t have time for this.”When it came to performance, she said, Ambramović had told her several years ago that “once you commit to an idea, it basically negates all the fear” and that “if you believe that the particular artistic idea that you chose is good enough, then you just kind of don’t care about physical safety, or emotional safety”.“I’m sure it’s gonna be triggering as fuck at some points for me to sit there,” she added. “But do I care? No. Because I think the work has to be done, and I’ll deal with it later.”Tolokonnika’s punk aesthetic is not something she adopts for performances. She told me cheerfully about almost getting blown up by pyrotechnics at a recent unauthorized concert, and praised the work of LA’sDead City Punx, a hardcore punk band and one of her planned collaborators in Los Angeles.“One thing that I just don’t vibe with in modern American society – there’s an entire thing about safety. And I’ve lived my life in a way that safety was the last thing that I would care about,” she said. “This is a thing I think about a lot lately. We need to be less safe, be ready to offend ourselves and other people. Otherwise, Maga people are just going to keep winning, because they’re not afraid.”View image in fullscreenThe Los Angeles museum where Nadya Tolokonnikova was performing closed its doors amid protests and a heavy police presence in the city.Photograph: Pilar Olivares/ReutersTolokonnikova told me she had hoped that people would come to her Moca exhibit with their children. “I’ve always been obsessed with building a version of Disneyland, but much more radical and grim,” she said. She had worked with Banksy on Dismaland, the artist’s 2015 dark Disney satire, but she’s still thinking about the possibilities of a more revolutionary theme park.“It’s just a giant waste of time and money the way that Disneyland looks now. It just doesn’t accomplish anything,” she said. Imagine, she suggested, if the animatronic characters of the Pirates of the Caribbean ride were instead a way for kids “to learn the history of the feminist movement”.“So instead of pirates doing this,” she said, jerking her arms, “it could be like, you’re a suffragette being arrested.”“Obviously, I don’t have a budget to build Disneyland,” she added. “But it was a dream of mine for ever.”Police State had been scheduled to run through June 13, with a final performance by Pussy Riot Siberia, Tolokonnikova’snew performance collective, to close it out. Now, it is postponed to an unknown date in the future.“I guess the National Guard will be performing POLICE STATE instead of me this week,” Tolokonnikova wrote on Instagram.Explore more on these topicsArtLos AngelesLos Angeles Ice protestsPussy RiotfeaturesShareReuse this content"

After that long abroad, I was just exhausted. So when I went to the ATM to get money out, I made a critical mistake.At home in Australia, we take the card out and then we get our cash. In Argentina, where I was, it’s the reverse – first your cash comes out, then your card. So I put my card in, got my money and just walked away, leaving my card behind.I was already on the other side of the street when I felt a tap on my shoulder. I turned around and this hulking Dutch guy handed me my bank card, telling me I’d forgotten it. I immediately burst into tears, then thanked him profusely and tried to offer him a reward. He politely refused, and away he went.I was in a town called El Calafate, and the next day I travelled to the Perito Moreno Glacier. There I saw him through the crowd – tall Dutchmen are easy to spot!I ran after him to say: “Hey, you’re the guy who returned my bank card!” He didn’t really remember me, because I was nobody important in his life, but he was certainly important in mine. I said to him, ‘Look, I really want to give you something to say thanks – how about I shout you a beer?’The kindness of strangers: a woman I’d never met heard we had flu and dropped a big pot of soup at our doorstepRead moreHe was travelling with some friends, so the three of us perched in the little cafe and drank a beer. I was just so happy that I could thank this man – whose name, I learned, was Bart – and give him a little token of my appreciation.Bart thought what he had done was no big deal, but to me it was. This was in 2009, a different time for technology. If he hadn’t returned my card, I would have been in a big mess. I only carried the one card, which in hindsight was a bit careless, but that’s what I had.If you’re traveling with somebody else you can use their card for a while and reimburse them later; when you’re on your own, it’s a whole different situation. And every traveller knows that any problem on holiday feels magnified to the extreme!All these years later, I have not forgotten Bart’s act of kindness. At the cafe, we took a photo together, which I’ve always kept.What is the nicest thing a stranger has ever done for you?Share your experienceFrom making your day to changing your life, we want to hear about  chance encounters that have stuck with you.Please share your story if you are 18 or over, anonymously if you wish.

This is a war Israel chose. It could have been prevented. Diplomatic talks were ongoing when the bombers took off for Iran. Israel’s continuing, illegal, unjustified airstrikes are unlikely to achieve their stated aim – permanently ending Tehran’s presumed efforts to build nuclear weapons – and may accelerate it. They must stop now. Likewise, Iran must halt its retaliation immediately and drop itsescalatory threats to attack US and UK bases.This conflict is not limited, as was the case last year, to tit-for-tat exchanges and “precision strikes” on a narrow range of military targets. It’s reached a wholly different level. Potentially nothing is off the table.Civilians are being killedon both sides. Leaders are targets. The rhetoric is out of control. With Israel fighting on several fronts, and Iran’s battered regime backed against a wall, the Middle East is closer than ever to a disastrous conflagration.Reasons can always be found to go to war. The roots of major conflicts often reach back decades – and this is true of the Israel-Iran vendetta, which dates to the 1979 Islamic revolution. The so-called “shadow war” between the twointensified in recent years. Yet all-out conflict had been avoided, until now. So who is principally to blame for this sudden, unprecedented explosion?Answer: three angry old men whose behaviour raises serious doubts about their judgment, common sense, motives and even their sanity.The fact that one of them – Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel’s prime minister – has actively sought a showdown with Iran for years does not mean it had to happen. The fact the Tehran regime is unusually vulnerable after Israel’s attacks last year and the defeat of its Hezbollah ally does not somehow legitimise a surprise assault on its sovereign soil. It’s true that UN nuclear inspectorssay Iran is breaking treaty obligations. But that doesn’t amount to a green light for war.Netanyahu attacked Iran to avert an ‘existential threat’. He may have made it worse | Jonathan FreedlandRead moreNetanyahu, 75, is unfit to lead Israel, let alone make life-or-death decisions on its behalf. He failed to protect Israelis from the 2023 terror attacks,then dodged responsibility. He has failed to fulfil his vow to destroy Hamas and bring back the hostages, yet his soldiers have killed more than55,000 Palestinians in Gazain the process. Heinvaded LebanonandSyria. Now it’s Iran. Where will he stop? Will he fight Turkey next? It’s not out of the question.War is Netanyahu’s choice. It’s whatgets him out of bed in the morning. It’s what keeps him and hisUK-sanctioned far-right croniesin office and out of jail. His actions have inflicted extraordinary damage on his country’s reputation, fuelling antisemitism globally. He claims Israel is fighting for its existence – but his own political survivalis a prime consideration, too. Netanyahu has beenindicted for alleged war crimes in Gaza. He should be arrested, not defended and enabled, before any more crimes are committed.Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran’s bellicose supreme leader, is the second leading culprit. He should have been put out to grass in Qom years ago. The 86-year-old squats atop a repressive, corrupt theocratic regime that has lost touch with the society and people it ostensibly serves. Elections are fixed, judges are bent, media censorship is pervasive. The regime’s military incompetence, economic mismanagement and brutal persecution of young women, gay men andhuman rights defenders such as Nasrin Sotoudehare notorious.Like Netanyahu, Khamenei is backed by hardline conservatives and opposed by reformers, but it’s him who calls the shots. His suspiciousinsistence on stepping up uranium enrichment, even though civil applications are lacking, ultimately gave Netanyahu an opening. Although he is said to be unwell, Khamenei is a key reason why Iranwill not abandon its nuclear programme. Even without him, Netanyahu’s idea that it can be totally eliminated is fantasy.This blindspotmay be the regime’s final undoing. Israel’s strikes have killed senior military leaders and damaged nuclear facilities and ballistic missile and drone forces. Khamenei himself, and Iran’s vital energy exports, may be next. Ina patronising video, Netanyahu urged Iranians to rise up and seize their “freedom”. Many would like to. The difficulty with such advice, coming from a tainted source, is that it could have the opposite effect of rallying the public, and Arab leaders, around the regime.Iran’sthreats to attack US, British and French basesand ships if they help defend Israel, and toclose the strait of Hormuz, heighten the risk of full-scale war and a global energy shock that could hurt the west and benefit Russia. These are some of the direct consequences of Donald Trump’s weak, vacillating stance.Trump, 79, is the third man in this avoidable tragedy. He previously said he preferred tonegotiate a new nuclear dealwith Iran, havingidiotically trashed the previous one. But he couldn’t decide on terms, and his amateurish negotiators kept changing their position. That was partly because Trump, as with Palestine and Ukraine, is too idle to study the details. He wings it instead, trusting to instincts that are invariably bad. That makes him easy prey for wily operators such as Netanyahu.Trump’s feeble ineptitude meant that when Israel’s leader insisted last week that the time was right for an all-out attack on Iran, he folded. Typically, once the attack began, he switched,trying to claim creditand issuing flatulent threats of his own. Each time he opens his mouth, Trump inadvertently confirms Iran’s suspicions that the US and Israel are acting in close concert.An urgent message for Keir Starmer: anyone who still thinks Trump has even the remotest idea what he’s doing when confronting the big international questions of the day should study the alarming events of the past week. Whether he is selling out to Vladimir Putin, weaponising tariffs, botching a Gaza ceasefire or bullying neighbours,Trump is a total menace. Far better, and safer, for Britain to bypass him and try as much as possible to act independently of the US from now on.These angry old men could get us all killed.Simon Tisdall is a Guardian foreign affairs commentatorExplore more on these topicsIsraelOpinionIranBenjamin NetanyahuDonald TrumpAyatollah Ali KhameneiIran's nuclear programmeIran nuclear dealcommentShareReuse this content"

Trump’s crude but effective rhetorical standbyChris TaylorThe president has spent the past decade employing a familiar tactic. Accusing protesters of ‘insurrection’ is just the latest exampleSun 15 Jun 2025 09.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 15 Jun 2025 14.14 EDTShareDonald Trump and his allies wasted little time in branding the people protesting against immigration enforcement raids in Los Angeles as “insurrectionists”.Stephen Miller, the White House deputy chief of staff for policy – particularly the vindictive kind – spoke darkly of a “violent insurrection”. JD Vance, the vice-president, inveighed against “insurrectionists carrying foreign flags” on the streets of the nation’s second-biggest city.It didn’t escape notice that an insurrection was exactly what the president was accused of instigating on 6 January 2021, when the flag being paraded through the Capitol was that of the Confederate secessionists. And that Trump hadn’t shown quite the same enthusiasm for sending in the troops then.But simply accusing the leader of the Maga movement of hypocrisy feels like such a 2015 move. It barely registers as news these days.What’s really notable is that this is the latest example of Trump’s well-honed tactic of repurposing criticisms of himself to attack his enemies.The world was first introduced to this manoeuvre on 19 October 2016 during a presidential debate in Las Vegas. When Hillary Clinton accused Trump of being Vladimir Putin’s puppet, Trump shot back: “No puppet, no puppet … No, you’re the puppet.”To many it sounded infantile, more proof of Trump’s lack of seriousness as a candidate. Back then, Twitter was the go-to platform to register reaction, asCBS reported:“‘NO, YOU’RE THE PUPPET!’ A presidential candidate just went straight up preschool on his opponent,” one person tweeted.“‘NO YOU’RE THE PUPPET’ shows how truly childish our election system has become,” someone replied.True, but these reactions underestimated the power of this simple, some would say puerile, tactic. After all, this was a time when the term “fake news” was still used in its original sense of fringe media stories that were deliberately untrue before Trump restyled it into a catch-all term for the mainstream media and anything it produces that he doesn’t like.The fact that people are now less likely to associate “fake news” withPizzagatethan withTrump’s attacks on the likes of CNNshows just how effective this switcheroo is.But its real power lies in the way it undermines the very notion of truth. If everyone’s an insurrectionist, no one is. As withHumpty Dumpty, words mean what Trump wants them to mean.The more you look, the more you see the tactic everywhere. It’s a pretty safe bet the phrase “election interference” had never tripped off Trump’s tongue before 2016, when the question of Russia’s role in helping secure his election ultimately led to theMueller report. After he waschargedwith election interference following the 2020 vote, however, he accused, among others, theBiden administration, theSecret Service, Google, the BritishLabour partyandKamala Harris(on the – entirely false – grounds she had posted AI-created images of her rallies) of “election interference” in the 2024 contest.When Democrats accused Trump of trying to “weaponize” the Department of Justice in his attempts to illicitly stay in office after his 2020 election defeat, it was only a question of time before “weaponization” would re-emerge, rotated 180 degrees, as a favourite term in the Maga lexicon of vitriol. Once Republicans regained control of the House of Representatives in 2023, it was they who set up a formalsubcommittee on “weaponization” of the federal government, to castigate their enemies. And when the Trump 2.0 administration weaponized the federal government tofire justice department officialswho had participated in Jack Smith’s “election interference” case against Trump on the grounds that they had weaponized the government … we had truly stepped through the looking glass.Accusing anti-racist campaigners of racism?Check. Denouncing Jews as antisemites?Check.And it’s all helped by another apparently childish but startlingly effective tactic: repetition. Why did amajority of Republicansin 2024 believe that Biden’s election victory four years earlier was rigged despite all evidence to the contrary? Probably because Trump spent fours years, day after day, saying it was. Why didso many Americansin the 2024 election campaign insist they had been better off four years earlier despite the demonstrable fact that Covid-hit 2020 had been an economic disaster? Well, maybe Trump’s constant bragging about presiding over the “greatest economy in the history of the world” had more than a little method to it. (As the musicianMark E Smith saidin another context: “It’s not repetition; it’s discipline.” You can say that again.)Trump’s rhetorical tropes may display a certain reptilian genius but there is nothing new under the sun.“The English follow the principle that when one lies, one should lie big, and stick to it. They keep up their lies, even at the risk of looking ridiculous.” So claimed a 1941 article calledChurchill’s Lie Factorywritten by one Joseph Goebbels, who had been accused of … exactly that.Chris Taylor is a subeditor at the Guardian US and author ofThe Black Carib Wars: Freedom, Survival, and the Making of the GarifunaExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionUS politicsLos Angeles Ice protestsUS Capitol attackcommentShareReuse this content"

Contemporary culture often portrays young boys as the victims of a new social order that gives them no blueprint for how to be a man in the 21st century. At worst, we see them as disciples of misogynists such as Andrew Tate, as perpetrators of violence, or as victims of divisive, rightwing ideologies.It can seem as though young men are inevitably bound to be radicalised. More than half of gen-Z men in the US aged between 18 and 29voted for Donald Trump. As Southgate put it in his lecture, more of our sons than we could possibly realise are beholden to “callous toxic influencers”, including Tate.In recent research we commissioned at St Dunstan’s Education Group, the group of private schools that I lead, we found that nearly half (49%) of 18 to 25-year-old men felt there were very few strong male role models in society, while 17% of young men said that credible accusations of sexual assault wouldnotchange their perception of someone they considered a role model. More than half (59%) of young men felt that feminism had gone too far.Although it’s clear that boys are failing to understand their place in the world and are misguidedlyblaming feminismand broader advances in women’s rights for their perceived irrelevance, this is far from inevitable. While our instinct might be to judge young men, we need to unpick the context in which they grow up. As the youngest generation of men retreat online, they have moved away from traditional concepts of what makes a person admirable. Real-life role models have been eclipsed by an unregulated online world that capitalises on teenage uncertainty and presents viewers with misrepresentations of sex, body image and success.In my years as a teacher, I have seen how the curriculum can help to support people through these challenges. Carving out meaningful time to work with young people and have discussions about their identity, purpose and choices is invaluable. Unpicking the positive attributes of masculinity and feminist thinking helps students understand the complexity of these topics. At our school in south-east London, we introduced courses that examine identity and online spaces, pornography addiction, toxic representations of gender and online influencers. We felt it was important to create time for young people to sit together and talk through these issues.Teaching these subjects requires sensitivity, careful consideration and meaningful time. Although relationships and sex education (RSE) is compulsory in all secondary schools, it is often shoehorned into odd corners of the curriculum and tutor time. This fragmented approach limits its impact, particularly when it is delivered by undertrained, non-specialist teachers. Despite the urgency of issues like consent, online safety and gender identity, time devoted to exploring these topics remains far too short. The PSHE Association (the national body for PSHE education) recommends at least one hour per week across all key stages, but this is rarely guaranteed and, in many state schools, PSHE receives far less attention than other subjects.To address this, reform must extend beyond well-resourced independent schools. Over 90% of children in the UK are educated in the state sector, where schools face stricter timetable constraints and less curricular flexibility. A society-wide issue demands a society-wide solution, which should be led by the government and the Department for Education. National policy should establish clearer expectations, including protected curriculum time, dedicated teacher training and financial support. Only then can we ensure that every child, regardless of background, receives the education they need to navigate relationships, identity and the modern world with resilience and understanding.Adolescence: what teen boys really think of girls, influencers and porn – podcastRead moreYet curriculum reform is only one part of the solution. As the father of two young children and as an educator, I was particularly reassured by other statistics from our research: for the majority (50%) of young men, their biggest role model is still their father, while a fifth (20%) chose a male teacher as the second most significant person in their life.It’s easy to despair at what the future may hold for the next generation, but there is something deeply reassuring that those closest to young people still have real influence on them and the power to provide an antidote to misogynistic influencers.Putting down our phones, being present, playing with our children, going for walks, talking to them about choices and values, offering support when needed: all of this can be just as potent as any online narrative, if not more so. When young people turn to online spaces, what they’re looking for is guidance, and if we can offer that in an alternative, positive and reinforcing way we can begin to counteract the harmful language and stereotypes that flourish there.As educators and as individuals, we have the ability to stand up to this challenge. We can reshape young people’s understanding of not just masculinity, but gender, relationships, sexuality and our values as a society. In my professional and personal life I have witnessed the value of speaking to young people in the language they recognise, even about topics they may find particularly difficult or confusing. The challenge is great, but together we have the tools to rise to it.Nick Hewlett is chief executive of the St Dunstan’s Education Group, a network of private schools in south-east LondonDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Here’s my adviceEmma BeddingtonTwo-thirds of women apparently think about doing something different with their careers. Personally, I think I’d make a fantastic archaeologist or opera singerSun 15 Jun 2025 09.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 15 Jun 2025 16.30 EDTShareHaving run out of cooking shows to look at with my post-work crisps, I have taken to just watching what’s on TV, which is mostly A New Life in the Sun: Where Are They Now?and Château DIY. Both feature British people who have made radical changes, living out their dreams with wildly varying degrees of competence and success, mostly running restaurants, wedding venues, gites or creative retreats in idyllic locations.There is a reason these shows air in the early evening, as we close our laptops with a defeated clunk or get home after another awful commute: they are selling the notion that another life is possible. Only the very fortunate, or pathologically positive, wash up on the sofa at 6.30pm daily with the clear-eyed, full-hearted certainty that they have spent the day doing precisely what they were put on earth to do with their wild, precious lives.I was thinking about this as I read aboutGood Housekeeping’s recent survey, in which two-thirds of women said they would change career: 31% “dream about the possibility” and 34% “are open to pivoting”. This seems low – did they conduct this survey on payday, or are GH readers a particularly glass-half-full breed? Don’t we all feel this? Gallup’s 2025State of the Global Workplace reportshowed a decline in employee engagement and wellbeing, with 79% (87% in Europe) either not engaged or “actively disengaged” and only 33% of employees rating themselves as “thriving”. We are, globally, not super into our jobs.I don’t want a new life in the sun – I fear the fiery orb almost as much as I fear changing duvet covers, which seems to constitute an unacceptably large part of most televised new starts I’ve seen – but I do occasionally imagine a different life (somewhere with reliably heavy cloud cover) and job. Not that mine is bad. A friend once read about working conditions in Nigerian sawmills and it became our shorthand for work infinitely worse than ours. Sitting in a supportive chair, a cup of tea by my elbow, typing, with frequent breaks to play with the hens or stare into the fridge is as far from the Nigerian sawmill as you can get. I have nothing to complain about and I’m not complaining. I just often feel incompetent and anxious and – if you can believe it – slightly pointless.Like everyone (right?), I have parallel-life jobs that a little late-night voice in my head whispers I would perhaps have enjoyed more, or been better at: archaeologist or translator; art historian or wildlife rehabber. Then there are the fantastical ones, that I’m temperamentally unsuited to and have no talent for but wish it were otherwise: opera singer, professional aesthete, Zadie Smith, the pope. Unlike 45% of the Good Housekeeping survey respondents, I don’t need a better work/life balance but, like 43% of them, I often think I could be doing something more meaningful, and might enjoy a new challenge (40%), say, issuing style diktats or papal encyclicals.But, but, but. As anyone who has tried to get a job recently will tell us wistful wonderers, the grass may be greener, but good luck getting to it. The employment market ishorrible, withUK unemployment at its highest in four years. Opportunities and rates are beinghollowed out by artificial intelligence, especially increative industries– and that applies equally, if not more, to freelancers. Then there are the increasingly dehumanising and absurd hiring protocols –AI “applicant tracking systems”screening CVs,interminable selection processesimposed by employers emboldened by a buyer’s market,chatbot interviews– potentiallybaking in bias and discrimination.I suspect we mostly know that, just as we know that even dream jobs are just jobs some days. Answering a Good Housekeeping survey or watching New Lives in the Sun offer a safe space to dream a little. I’ve started treating the show as a gentle nightly public service: a reminder that dumping the nine-to-five to live your dream could involve ant infestations, floods, labyrinthine local regulations, loneliness or dry rot. Could things be better? Possibly. Could they be worse? Absolutely. Would they most likely be sort of the same, but different? Yeah, probably.Emma Beddington is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsWomenOpinionWork & careerscommentShareReuse this content"

But there are still reasons to hopeSun 15 Jun 2025 07.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 15 Jun 2025 16.38 EDTShareLike so many others, I watched the video of Rümeysa Öztürk, a Turkish student at Tufts University, as she was surrounded by men dressed in black, some wearing masks. They carried guns. One grabbed her by the collar. The men surrounded her, and one handcuffed her. You can hear her short shrieks of fear.She must have been terrified. I know I was when, as a 19-year-old student, I was kidnapped off the streets of Buenos Aires by members of an irregular taskforce. I know what it feels like and I know what it portends.My kidnapping occurred in 1977. One year earlier, I was in bed when my mother came to my door with a portable radio broadcasting a military march. Later, I saw tanks rolling down the streets. It was the saddest thing I’d ever seen. An authoritarian military junta had overthrown the government. Its mission, it said, was to restore order – just as, in the US today, the theme offered for public consumption is one of restoration, taking us back to a supposedly better time.In those years, the Argentine state became a terrorist: it chose the systematic violation of rights to supposedly protect a society with western, Christian values from leftist and communist “terrorists”.I and my fellow activists were not terrorists. We were leafleting, attending rallies, painting walls with our slogans. I had joined a group of like-minded idealists. But the government sought to neutralize us: if we weren’t going to go away, we would be “disappeared” – as I was, and as Öztürk was supposed to be. The authoritarian government targeted not only dissidents, but the media, the legal establishment and the intellectual elites, especially those who taught at universities, which were denounced as hotbeds of leftist thought.Condemnations byDonald Trumpecho almost verbatim. To an authoritarian regime, dissent is a threat. Now, in the US, it is foreigners being cast as enemies of the state. Öztürk’s apparent infraction was that she was a foreign student who co-wrote an op-ed in her student newspaper denouncing Israeli military action in Gaza as a “genocide.”Like Öztürk, I was treated as an enemy of the state. I became one of thedisappeared.In Argentina, the institutional checks on power were systematically destroyed. The legislature was abolished, the judiciary cowed or co-opted. In the US, Republican majorities in the legislature have voluntarily given up their independence, but the result is the same. The chief executive acts with impunity. Having tamed the legislative branch, Trump has moved on to the judiciary. He demands loyalty, denounces “activist” judges and calls for their impeachment. Judges and their family members have been doxed, their images and personal information circulated online. In April, the Judicial Conference of the United States officially requested anincrease in funding for security.In this climate, judges have and must continue to uphold the rule of law even as they do so at great personal risk. After a six week ordeal, Öztürk was finally released by order of a brave federal court judge. She has been returned to her community and upon her releaseshe stated: “I have faith in the American system of justice.” For this system to continue, judges must be protected.This small victory is just a beginning; so many others remain incarcerated. It took nearly two years to secure my release and even then, it was not through the power of the courts. During those years, the Argentine military acted with omnipotence and impunity. They were convinced that they would never be brought to justice for their crimes, because no one ever had been before.But with the return of democracy, the constitutional government took the members of the juntas to trial and I was called to testify. It was a historic moment, and a collective catharsis for the victims. Several of the former commanders in chief received severe sentences. Government accountability inArgentinabegan only after the fall of the regime. During the reign of the junta, there had been a total collapse of the judiciary.Forty years have passed since then, and under the government of Javier Milei, the Argentine state vindicates the dictatorship and justifies state terrorism. Still, the courts in Argentina today are a critical bulwark against a return to the horrors of the past. In the US, too, the courts are critical to prevent a descent into totalitarian horrors. In the camp in which I spent most of my time in captivity, 90% of the prisoners were murdered by being thrown out of a plane, alive. (I spent 20 years of my life bringing the pilots of those planes to justice.)In the 1980s, after I was kept as adesaparecidain two clandestine detention centers, enduring torture during my captivity, I found refuge in New York. It was there that I was able to pronounce the word “disappeared” for the first time and to denounce the horrors still being denied by the military junta without looking at the door of my house in terror, waiting for armed men to burst in to kidnap me. I worked in the office of an immigration attorney as an interpreter and paralegal and was in contact with migrants from all over the world who arrived in search of tranquility and freedom.Some had fled their countries for their lives, like me. I had a special empathy with them, and I found it repulsive to hear they were labeled “illegal”. I listened to stories of immigration service operations in factories or on public roads and received distressing calls in the office from relatives who did not know what had happened to their family members. They reminded me of the desperation of the Mothers of Plaza de Mayo, who were unsuccessfully searching for their loved ones in Argentina. Today, I still have blood ties to the US. And I am fearful for the country. I have seen how autocracy begins and I see signs of it everywhere.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFighting BackFree newsletterBig thinkers on what we can do to protect civil liberties and fundamental freedoms in a Trump presidency.

How could honest citizens halt cruelty? Is it feasible to hold accountable government officials who violate basic rights?Immigrants being sent to detention facilities abroad, the White House considering suspending habeas corpus, the repression of protests by the military in the streets of LA – all are serious threats to US democracy. But resistance in other cities and lawsuits filed to block deployment of troops seem to be a shield against the prevalence of these authoritarian measures. Responsible and accurate independent media coverage both in the country and abroad, the creation and strengthening of civil rights advocacy organizations such as the Mothers of Plaza de Mayo, and proposals to include basic human rights protections in the US constitution, as done in post-dictatorial Argentina in 1994, could be a way of ensuring freedom for upcoming generations.What gives me hope are the expressions of individual and collective rebellion, both in the US and Argentina. Judges who make decisions that question and even penalize the abuses of political power are necessary. But judges cannot uphold our democracy on their own.We need members of Congress who vote against dangerous reforms and budget cuts; human rights organizations that make institutional violence visible; journalists who – at the risk of losing their jobs – communicate the truth; and broad collective action of ordinary citizens who through their demonstrations repudiate the government and take to the streets to show that the flame of freedom is still alive. We must raise our voices against authoritarianism. It is our moral duty to overcome the reign of fear. Immigrants and dissidents are on the frontline. Judges are a critical backstop. We must work to protect them all.Miriam Lewin is a leading Argentine journalist and survivor of the dictatorship.

Not least because there is no escaping a persistent flaw: large language models (LLMs) remain prone to casually making things up.It’s a phenomenon known as “hallucination”. In arecent blogpost, the barrister Tahir Khan cited three cases in which lawyers had used large language models to formulate legal filings or arguments – only to find they slipped in fictitious supreme court cases, and made up regulations, or nonexistent laws.UK government rollout of Humphrey AI tool raises fears about reliance on big techRead more“Hallucinated legal texts often appear stylistically legitimate, formatted with citations, statutes, and judicial opinions, creating an illusion of credibility that can mislead even experienced legal professionals,” he warned.In arecent episode of his podcast, the broadcaster Adam Buxton read out excerpts from a book he had bought online, purporting to be a compilation of quotes and anecdotes about his own life, many of which were superficially plausible – but completely fictitious.The tech-sceptic journalist Ed Zitron arguedin a recent blogpostthat the tendency of ChatGPT (and every other chatbot) to “assert something to be true, when it isn’t”, meant it was “a non-starter for most business customers, where (obviously) what you write has to be true”.Academics at the University of Glasgow have said that because the models are not set up to solve problems, or to reason, but to predict the most plausible-sounding sentence based on the reams of data they have hoovered up, a better word for their factual hiccups is not “hallucinations” but “bullshit”.In a paper from last year that glories in the title“ChatGPT is bullshit”, Michael Townsen Hicks and his colleagues say: “Large language models simply aim to replicate human speech or writing. This means that their primary goal, insofar as they have one, is to produce human-like text. They do so by estimating the likelihood that a particular word will appear next, given the text that has come before.”In other words, the “hallucinations” are not glitches likely to be ironed out – but integral to the models. Arecent paper in New Scientistsuggested they are getting more frequent.Even the cutting-edge forms of AI known as “large reasoning models”suffer “accuracy collapse”when faced with complex problems, according to a much-shared paper from Apple last week.None of this is to subtract from the usefulness of LLMs for many analytical tasks – and neither are LLMs the full extent of generative AI; but it does make it risky to lean on chatbots as authorities – as those lawyers found.If LLMs really are more bullshitters than reasoning machines, that has several profound implications.First, it raises questions about the extent to which AI should really be replacing – rather than augmenting or assisting – human employees, who take ultimate responsibility for what they produce.Last year’s joint winner of the Nobel prize for economics Daron Acemoglu says that given its issues with accuracy, generative AI as currently conceived will replace only a narrowly defined set of roles in the foreseeable future. “It’s going to impact a bunch of office jobs that are about data summary, visual matching, pattern recognition, etc. And those are essentially about 5% of the economy,”he said in October.He calls for more research effort to be directed towards building AI tools that workers can use, rather than bots aimed at replacing them altogether.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

As Sandra Wachter of the Oxford Internet Institute put this recently: “Everybody’s just throwing their empty cans into the forest. So it’s going to be much harder to have a nice walk out there because it’s just being polluted, and because those systems can pollute so much quicker than humans could.”Third, governments should rightly be open to adopting new technologies, including AI – but with a clear understanding of what they can and can’t do, alongside a healthy scepticism of some of their proponents’ wilder (and riskier) claims.To ministers’ credit, last week’s spending review talked as much about “digitisation” as about AI as a way of improving public services.Ministers are well aware that long before swathes of civil servants are replaced by chatbots, the UK’s put-upon citizenry would like to be able to hear from their doctor in some other format than a letter.ChatGPT and its rivals have awesome power: they can synthesise vast amounts of information and present it in whatever style and format you choose, and they’re great for unearthing the accumulated wisdom of the web.But as anyone who has met a charming bullshitter in their life will tell you (and who hasn’t?), it is a mistake to think they will solve all your problems – and wise to keep your wits about you.Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)Economics viewpointTechnology sectorChatGPTEconomic policyEconomicscommentShareReuse this content"

And who wants to cook or plan with a toddler in tow anyway?Sun 15 Jun 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 15 Jun 2025 16.33 EDTShareNext week, I’m going on an all-inclusive holiday to Greece. All-inclusives have a famously bad rep for all-day boozing, and in certain quarters there is a sniffiness about their supposed chips with everything, Brits abroad vibe. For some people, the idea of being confined to a hotel, even one with a beautiful beach attached, sounds awful. But, like many parents, I’ve become a convert.How did I get here? I think it was always on the cards. When I was small, holiday brochures were my bibles. I’d spend hours perusing them and comparing the hotels: their azure pools framed by water slides undulating in spaghetti-like nests, their private white-sand beaches with lines of striped parasols, and these things called “kids’ clubs”, which offered all kinds of fun activities and, most excitingly, a disco.All-inclusives were big in the 90s, at least in my small Welsh community. International travel had become more accessible to working-class families, and they were flocking to Spain and Greece. My classmates would return bronzed, with portions of their hair wrapped in silken, coloured threads of embroidery, their talk of “tapas” and “pesetas” sounding impossibly glamorous. They knew all the big hits before they hit British shores – Saturday Night, Macarena – and the dances to match. I would feel wild with jealousy.We had never been able to afford an all-inclusive, but in my mid-teens I went on a couple of package deals and had the best time: finally, I got to swim in a sea so clear you could see the bottom! I did karaoke and went parasailing and – despite a teenage pregnancy scare that hung over a mother-daughter trip to Zakynthos until I finally, jubilantly got my period on a tour boat to Navagio beach – I fell desperately in love with Greece.I didn’t really realise there was a snobbery about package holidays until I started university and met people who had grown up with second homes or who took expensive gap years, prattling on about all the remote places they had seen, how they’d slummed it in a beach shack (before recuperating in a five-star hotel, of course). I guess I bought into it to an extent, because I spent my 20s trying to get to the most remote and underpopulated Greek islands possible.The one all-inclusive I experienced at that time was in Cuba, as it was the only accommodation available near a particular beach. It was full of Canadians who had brought their own drinking receptacles because the hotel’s plastic cups didn’t hold enough piña colada. To quote The Lazy River, Zadie Smith’s all-inclusive-set short story, they were drinking “so much alcohol that your accommodation is effectively free”. One night, the “entertainment” was a monkey riding a donkey, though I could have been hallucinating because of all the rum.It was only when I became a parent that I fully appreciated the sheer joy of the all-inclusive. After my son was born prematurely, and in his first year needed some hospital treatment, I didn’t want to take him to a place where the only way out was a twice-weekly boat, where there was no doctor, or even a pharmacy. I had certainly become a more anxious traveller, but also I was knackered. I didn’t want to cook. I didn’t want to have to plan. I wanted a holiday, but I wanted it to be easy.This generation of parents is the most well-travelled in human history, their tastes have been refined, and I found that a lot of all-inclusives have upped their game. Ikos, especially, is now the word on a certain kind of British parent’s lips. With its gourmet cuisines (including gourmet baby food), creches following Ofsted guidelines and incredible service (they literally take your baby’s bottles away, sanitise them and bring them back to your room), its resorts are a world away from the sorts of all-inclusives I lusted after as a child. We were only ever able to holiday with them once, in Halkidiki, thanks to my selling my novel, getting a really good deal on the trip, having a child under two and booking at a time when it was more likely to rain (which it did) – but we were the most relaxed I think it’s possible to be on holiday with a baby, and if I ever get a windfall I will totally be back.If it takes a village to raise a child, it takes a youth hostel to give their parents a break | Nell FrizzellRead moreThankfully, you don’t have to pay those prices for a great all-inclusive experience. I love Grecotel, the more affordable Greek chain, because the mostly Mediterranean food is excellent and it’s very kid-friendly (last year, at their hotel on Corfu, my son got to experience a water slide for the first time, and it felt as if I had come full circle and achieved my childhood dreams). Part of the reason that I can’t stand snobbery about all-inclusive hotels is because lots of them are more and more accessible, not only to those with small children but to disabled people. In many places you can hire mobility scooters, wheelchairs and buggies.One of the reasons we didn’t travel much when I was growing up was because of my brother’s complex needs. It was a different world back then, a fact that hit me last year as I stood in the check-in queue at Corfu airport and noted big advertising screens proudly displaying their “Boarding pass for autism”. Suddenly, I was wiping away tears. On returning, I discovered that Tui is now advertising “neuro-inclusive” holidays. Some of its hotels now have sensory rooms, and its childcare staff are trained in special educational needs.These things matter to families. At a time when parents are stressed, skint, overworked and often isolated, an all-inclusive is a pressure-off option. Don’t knock it until you’ve tried it. Personally, I’d take one over a campsite in France any day.Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsFamily holidaysOpinionGreece holidaysEurope holidayscommentShareReuse this content"

The convictions shook public trust in the NHS and demanded a reckoning with a system and culture that had failed to prevent such horrors. In August 2023, thisnewspaperurged readers to look beyond individual guilt to the institutional failures that allowed such crimes to go undetected for so long. It remains the case that serious questions must be asked of NHS management and clinical staff in relation to the tragic events at the Countess of Chester hospital.However, justice, like science, should not be afraid to re-examine its conclusions when reasonable doubt or fresh evidence emerge. Since Letby’s conviction, many have questioned the basis of the prosecution case.Leading expertshave raised challenges about the reliability of key medical assumptions and the quality of statistical interpretations that led to Letby being jailed. Her guilt or innocence is not for the media to decide. But journalism plays a vital role in scrutinising government, parliament and the courts. When a serious body of concern arises around a conviction, particularly one so grave and emotionally charged, the state has a duty to respond not with defensiveness, but with clear candour.The official inquiry into the Letby case, headed by Lady Justice Thirlwall, is set to report in 2026. The judge said she could not examine the safety of theconviction. The decision to continue with the inquiry on those terms, for which the health secretary, Wes Streeting, was also responsible, is regrettable. While the grief and anger of the families who lost their children must remain central, their pain is not diminished by the state subjecting itself to scrutiny. On the contrary, trust in public institutions depends on a willingness to confront hard questions – especially the most uncomfortable ones.A miscarriage of justice may have occurred in this case. It may not. But accepting the possibility that it could have – and allowing a mechanism to guard against error is essential. The criminal justice system, like all human institutions, makes mistakes. Its integrity depends not on infallibility but on the ability to admit errors and correct them. The Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC) is weighing the merits of an appeal. The commission has faced justified criticism over its failings in the wrongful conviction of Andrew Malkinson. As thereview of that casewarned, justice demands we keep the risk of mistakes firmly in mind.It is in that spirit that the CCRC’s new chair, Vera Baird KC, should approach this matter. The commission must demonstrate the independence, transparency and diligence required for justice to be served – even in cases where grief and outrage weigh heavily. No case, however disturbing, should be exempt from reassessment if evidence demands it. The commission can only refer cases back to the court of appeal on the narrow ground that there is a realistic possibility that the judges there may overturn a conviction. The bench has twice declined – in May 2024 and March this year – to re-examine or admit challenges to Letby’s conviction. Persisting with such a course risks hardening public doubt, not resolving it. In moments like this, it is wise to remember that justice must be done and be seen to be done.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Now a medical author is blazing a trail with a true storySun 15 Jun 2025 12.25 EDTLast modified on Sun 15 Jun 2025 14.30 EDTShareFemale nonfiction writers arepaid less on average, receive fewer reviews and win fewer prizes than men. Unsurprisingly, this means that women sell fewer books. So far this year, more than 60% of titles on the UK’s hardback and paperback nonfiction bestseller lists have beenby men.Kate Mosse wants to change this. Famously, she set up the Women’s prize for fiction after there was not a single woman on the 1991 Booker shortlist. This year Ms Mosse’s award celebrates its 30th anniversary. With previous winners including Zadie Smith, Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie and Maggie O’Farrell, it has changed the publishing landscape to the extent that some suggest it is now redundant: last year, five out of the six books on theBooker prize shortlistwere by women, and the winner was Samantha Harvey. Indeed, such is the pre-eminence of female novelists that there is talk of acrisis in men’s fiction, and plans for an independent publisher,Conduit Books, especially for male authors.Nonfiction publishing, however, is a strikingly different story. Hence Ms Mosse’s latest project: the Women’s prize for nonfiction, which aims to do for female authors of serious narrative nonfiction what has already been achieved with fiction. Last year, Naomi Klein’s quasi-memoirDoppelganger, about conspiracy theories and truth in politics, was the award’s first winner. Last week,The Story of a Heart, by the doctor and writer Rachel Clarke, became the second, with her moving interweaving of the story of two children connected by a heart transplant with the history of heart surgery.Nonfiction books by women are not the only ones in need of help. With a few notable exceptions (including Prince Harry’s memoir Spare and James Clear’s self-help bestseller Atomic Habits), the overall picture for nonfiction publishing is bleak: last year, specialist and trade nonfiction combined had their lowest sales, in money terms,since 2015. In another blow for the publishing industry, last week aNational Literacy Trustreport revealed that reading for enjoyment among children and young people in the UK is at its lowest level in two decades. Only a quarter of teenage boys said they read books in their free time.One understandable response to figures like these is to emphasise the value of reading per se. But who and what we read matters as well as whether we do it. Part of the imbalance in nonfiction has been a historical perception of male expertise, particularly on certain topics. As with bias in class and race, publishing has been slow to address this proactively. In her 2021 book,The Authority Gap, examining why women are still taken less seriously than men, Mary Ann Sieghart stresses the importance of encouraging boys to read books about girls, and for men to seek out women’s voices.There have been many efforts to address such discrimination constructively.Women Also Know Stuff, for example, is a database of experts created with the aim of increasing female representation. “Most women fight wars on two fronts,” Rebecca Solnit wrote in her essayMen Explain Things to Me. “One for whatever the putative topic is and one simply for the right to speak, to have ideas, to be acknowledged to be in possession of facts and truths, to have value.” For the help it offers to female authors fighting such battles, as well as the attention it brings to new books, the Women’s prize for nonfiction should be welcomed.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Later he added: “There’s no one to blame but myself, so I apologise to the whole team and to Oscar for attempting something probably a bit too silly. I’m glad I didn’t ruin his race.”The McLaren team principal, Andrea Stella, told Sky Sports: “We definitely never want to see the two McLarens touching each other. At the same time, it’s a contact that happened because of a misjudgment. Lando misjudged the distance to the car ahead. There was no malintent and Lando owned up immediately, took responsibility, which we appreciate. But it’s certainly something to discuss and review.”Piastri said the tussle between the two drivers had been a fair one. “It was a tough battle but a clean one. I don’t think there were any bad intentions involved, I think it was just unfortunate. We’re both fighting for a world championship and I’m very thankful to the team that they allow us to race. I don’t expect this to change anything in terms of that.”The long straights, heavy braking zones, kerbs and lack of long, fast corners at the Montreal circuit did not play to the strengths of McLaren’s car, which has set the pace everywhere else in 2025, and Norris is fortunate that his error cost him a fifth place, not second. It is not the first time Norris has made costly errors this season, while Piastri, a small error in Australia in greasy conditions apart, has been a model of consistency.Explore more on these topicsFormula OneMotor sportnewsShareReuse this content"

A few moments earlier he’d been introduced by a marketing manager who spoke about Lionel Messi’s new energy drink in tones of high-performance evangelism, gazing with doe-eyed wonder at the small plastic bottle in his hand and predicting that the “official hydration partner of the Argentine FA” (water: you’re out) would go on not just to make you less thirsty or become a popular choice in petrol stations, but to “inspire generations”. Here was a guy who has really drunk the Mas.Messi shows glimpses of his genius on Fifa’s stage of fakery as Club World Cup beginsRead moreAnd why not? The Mas by Messi launch was an intoxicating event. Beautiful fragrant people drifted about enjoying the Mas vibes, the Mas buzz, the bottomless Mas shots at the bar (“Try the Berry Mix, sir?”). Reporters and TV crews, the Mas Media, lurked at the fringes. Even the World Cup was here, lending its gravity from behind its bulletproof plinth.Mas does seem a fitting edition to the energy drink pantheon, in that it also tastes like someone has washed a packet of Skittles with sea water and collected it in a plastic skip. But perhaps the most striking thing, all the more so the morning after adistinctly framed Club World Cup opening night, is that it has an excellent name.Mas means more, as in more gas, ever deeper energy levels, and to be fair after spending the first 20 minutes like a man looking for his keys on the beach, Messi did get notably stronger as the night went on. Mas is also the name of the wealthy and useful owners of Inter Miami, Jorge and Jose.It captures in one word Fifa’s vision for football, which is basically gluttony, endless growth, the world is not enough.But above all of these things it’s good, current and culturally on point because it’s Spanish. And the one lesson so far of being around this roided-upClub World Cupis that Spanish is very clearly the lingua franca of this tournament, the language of football in America, and the language of elite football, as we say here, period.This is overwhelmingly a Hispano-Latin-Iberian tournament. And not just because it is based in South Florida, but structurally, economically and demographically.View image in fullscreenLionel Messi in action for Inter Milan during their goalless draw against Al Ahly.Photograph: Hannah McKay/ReutersFrom the US the furore over Trent Alexander-Arnold speaking a few words of Spanish seems doubly parochial. Not just because he now lives in Madrid and works for a Spanish employer. But because that elite tier of football, from players, to coaches to power brokers, is also speaking Spanish.The opening game was a massively Spanish/Hispanic/Central-South American affair, not just because 70% of the crowd were in Messi shirts, worn with the kind of event-zeal Americans bring to Halloween costumes or wearing a Pitbull scalp cap to a Pitbull show. The show was Spano-phile. the hype music was Latino club tune. Two days earlier the King of Football himself had delivered a rare video address at the Coral Gables golf club. And of course Gianni Infantino, for whom this was all, naturally,muy importante, spoke in spnissh.This applies just on the numbers. More than 300 South American players are here, a third of those taking part. A startling 105 Argentinian players are involved, 47 of them based outside Argentina. It feels like a moment of coronation for Argentina as the current chief single export power at this level of football. Guardiola‑ism remains, 20 years on, the tactical template for basically all football everywhere, to the extent the language of, even in English, is now Spanish-inflected, managers like Graham Potter and Enzo Maresca indefinably Spanish-styled.Club dressing rooms have long reflected this. Part of Luis Enrique’s transformation at Paris Saint-Germain has been to defeat “the divide”, the line between a previous Spanish-speaking mega-cartel and other parts of the squad. Asked to assess Kylian Mbappé’s suitability before his move to the French champions Messi himself commented at the time that Mbappé would be fine in Paris because “he speaks perfect Spanish”.Kalvin Phillips noted that one of the problems he found settling at Manchester City was the fact he didn’t speak Spanish, which sounds bizarre until you remember City have seven Spanish-speaking coaches, that John Stones had Spanish lessons to help him forge an understanding in defence, that Erling Haaland taking Spanish lessons even before he joined City was held up an example of his meticulous prep. Learning Spanish is probably the most obvious controllable element for anyone who wishes to make it in elite football now. José Mourinho, the translator, owes his career to his language facility. Infantino carries his mega-fluency like a weapon.It seems self-evident at this tournament, and self-evident given the holders of both men’s and women’s World Cup and Champions League are Spanish-speaking, given the makeup of recent world’s-best-player rosters, but this feels like a summit moment in football’s Spanish-inflected domination.And ever in place where everything from the opening night to the chat in the bars and buses and press conferences is in Spanish, football finds itself sitting naturally on a line of tension, a mirror to the world around it.View image in fullscreenRiver Plate players take part in a training session at Seattle Sounders’ complex.Photograph: Agustín Marcarian/ReutersFlorida’s tropical panhandle is also the site of Fifa’s newest HQ , a place that in turn sits right across one of the nation’s keenest racial and linguistic lines. Spanish is political here, both an immigrant language an the generational mother tongue of an influential part of the demographic. Nicaraguans, Venezuelans, Cubans and Mexicans have all been openly menaced by Donald Trump’s deportation rhetoric.Football has wrapped itself around this in Fifa’s key target market. The crowd that filled the stadium on Club World Cup opening night was hugely Latin, as was the crowd, to a lesser extent, at the No Kings protest in South Beach the same day, lining the pavements and grassy knolls, waving their placards in favour of Hispanic immigration rights, all beneath a vast Stalinist-scale mural of Messi himself, up above the fray like the eyes of Gatsby’s Doctor T.J. Eckleburg staring down sadly on the concerns of the world, while also, in a non-Mas twist, advocating the consumption of light Beer.There is a note of potential power shift here. Europe’s clubs will still dominate this Club World Cup, will scoop most of its $1bn prize pot, taking it back to the Uefa heartlands. The Premier League, which is only really an English entity in its geography, is the master of this process of talent outsourcing, a league so powerful it has in effect contracted out the production of talent and expertise.The Club World Cup may be driven by greed and the lust for power. It does, though, have a grain of a point when Fifa states that it might also become a redistributor of wealth. South America is keen on this tournament because it is a chance to take its own slice of the pie, perhaps even to reverse just a little its status as the production arm of European football, to halt that drift, the talent drain, to retain and develop more, to say, after many years as the colonial talent pool, No Mas.Explore more on these topicsClub World Cup 2025Lionel MessiClub World CupfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Duplantis delighted the Stockholm crowd by clearing 6.28m on his first attempt after raising the bar from 6m.It was the 12th time the two-time Olympic champion, who was born in the US but competes for Sweden, has broken the pole vault world record. In Stockholm he improved on his previous record, set in February, by 1cm on his first attempt.Having promised fans that he would try to break the record, Duplantis encouraged the crowd to get behind him from the moment his name was announced at the Olympiastadion and they responded by wildly clapping and cheering his every attempt as he cruised through the competition. Kurtis Marschall did his best to challenge the hometown favourite, but the Australian could manage a best of 5.90 before making three unsuccessful attempts to clear 6m.That left the field clear for Duplantis as the bar was raised to 6.28 for his world record attempt, and once again, the 25-year-old made it look easy. He powered through his run-up before planting his pole and soaring to another world record as the stadium, built for the 1912 Olympics, exploded in jubilation.Duplantis sprinted from the landing mat, tearing off his singlet to celebrate his first world record set on Swedish soil with his partner and family. “This was one of my biggest goals and dreams, to set a world record here at Stadion,” Duplantis said. “It’s like the Olympics and Stadion, they’re the same level for me. I really wanted to do it, I had my whole family here, from both sides, it’s magic, it’s magic.“Every time I broke the world record, I felt it in my first jump that ‘this could be the day’, but today it felt a little tougher. It didn’t feel that natural from the beginning, it didn’t feel great in my legs, but I only needed one [try].”Despite the confident impression he gave as he sailed over the bar, Duplantis said he was not convinced he had cleared it until his back hit the mat. “I almost couldn’t believe it, it felt like the very first time I broke the record. For me, I’m still a little hazy in my mind, it feels unreal, I’m just so happy, it’s a cloud nine feeling. It’s hard to explain, it’s hard to compare, it felt a bit like the Olympics.”Hunter Bell, the 1500m bronze medallist at Paris last summer, surged down the last 50 to win the women’s 800m in 1:57:66. The Briton had to take the long route to the finish line in lane three, but had too much power for Kenya’s 2023 world champion Mary Moraa and South Africa’s Prudence Sekgodiso. Great Britain’s Jemma Reekie also ran a season best time to finish fifth in 1:58:66.Dina Asher-Smith clocked 10.93sec to finish second in the 100m behind the Olympic champion Julien lfred, who won in 10.75. Daryll Neita was fifth in 11.17. The world indoor champion Amber Anning finished third in the women’s 400m, behind the American Isabella Whittaker in a season’s best 50.17.Innes Fitzgerald and Hannah Nuttall ran respective personal best times of 8:32:90 and 8:33:82 to finish third and fourth in the women’s 3,000m.George Mills was fifth in the men’s 1500m in a season best time of 3:32:67. Alastair Chalmers was also fifth in the 400m hurdles, in which the Dutch athlete Femke Bol blazed away over the last 100m to win in a season-best time for her of 52.11, eight-tenths of a second ahead of the American Dalilah Muhammad in second.Explore more on these topicsAthleticsWorld recordsnewsShareReuse this content"

Here, they had to do it tough, trailing until the final three minutes before Joe Ofahengaue’s late try helped to secure a precious win.“It’s a difficult place to come up to and win,” their coach, Adrian Lam, said. “It’s a real important part of the season and some stupid things put us under pressure. But they showed a lot of courage at the end to get that win – these are the ones that could really count and determine where you finish.”The weekend served up another reminder of why there are short odds on the grand final being a rematch of the 2024 showdown between the defending champions, Wigan Warriors, and theChallenge Cup winners, Hull KR. Rovers dismantled a woeful Catalans on Friday, while Wigan trailed Huddersfield when the full‑time hooter sounded on Saturday but still found a way to win thanks to Jack Farrimond’s try in added time.If either or both those teams slip up, however, there is an intriguing pack of teams below waiting to pounce – and these two are definite contenders.View image in fullscreenDavid Armstrong dives in to score a try for Leigh.Photograph: Sam Eaden/News ImagesFew would have given Wakefield a chance of making the playoffs when they won promotion toSuper League, but Daryl Powell’s team have acquitted themselves superbly in 2025. They sit seventh, just a point off sixth-placed Hull FC after this defeat but they could, and perhaps should, have been even higher.This was the fifth game Wakefield have lost by four points or fewer this season. But they will fancy themselves to improve as the season reaches its crescendo this summer.“We were really good for large parts,” Powell said. “But they were just too good, they’ve got some smart players and they got us in the end.”The full-backs exchanged tries early on, with Max Jowitt and Leigh’s David Armstrong crossing for well-taken scores.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Armstrong’s second put them further ahead before a wonderful team move led to Darnell McIntosh making it 18-6. But Oliver Pratt’s try just before the break halved that 12-point deficit, and after the interval the hosts started on the front foot.A mountain of pressure from Wakefield looked as though it would come to nothing but, with 16 minutes remaining, Corey Hall seized on a loose ball to touch down and put Trinity ahead.Leigh responded, though, with seven minutes to go as Ofahengaue, their latest impressive recruit from the National Rugby League, crashed over. As Lam said, who knows how pivotal that moment could be for both teams come September.Explore more on these topicsSuper LeagueWakefield TrinityLeigh LeopardsRugby leaguematch reportsShareReuse this content"

We managed to defend the [yellow] jersey and we can go home happy and prepare for the Tour.”The German Florian Lipowitz completed the podium, 2min 38sec behind Pogacar, while Belgium’s Remco Evenepoel came fourth at 4:21.Sunday’s final stage was a 133.3km mountainous trek from Val-d’Arc to Val-Cenis, with an uphill finish at the Plateau du Mont-Cenis. The 21-year-old Martinez caught the Spaniard Enric Mas with 8km to go to give France its first victory in this Dauphiné, finishing 34sec ahead of Vingegaard and Pogacar.Vingegaard tried to catch Martinez but was unable to shake off Pogacar. The Dane and the Slovenian then stopped attacking and rolled in together. Pogacar now has 99 victories to his name, a record for an active rider at just 26 years of age.“There’s a lot of positives from this week and we turned all the negatives into positives, so it’s all good,” said Pogacar, who bounced back from a poor time-trial performance in stage four to lay down the gauntlet to his principal Tour rivals. “There’s not much to do ahead of the Tour. I rest a bit, maybe some extra work for the time trial, and then I’m ready,” the three-time Tour winner added.The 2025 Tour de France runs from 5-27 July, with Pogacar the firm favourite after his first Dauphiné crown.Explore more on these topicsCyclingTadej PogačarnewsShareReuse this content"

Lee Carsley’s side were frustrated in the first half against a Slovenia team who threatened at times, but Ethan Nwaneri and Harvey Elliott spurned golden opportunities. James Beadle, the England goalkeeper, played his part in keeping them level with decent saves to deny Svit Seslar.Harvey Elliott helps England make winning start in Euro Under-21 against CzechsRead moreEngland will have to wait to secure their qualification against Germany, needing a draw to be sure when they meet in Nitra on Wednesday, while Slovenia kept their slim hopes of progressing alive. Germany beat the Czech Republic 4-2 in the later game, clinching qualification with two wins from two and eliminating their opponents.Carsley told Uefa.com: “It was a very tough game. We definitely didn’t underestimate Slovenia, who are a good, well-organised team. I definitely think we had enough chances to win, though, so the frustration is that we didn’t take those opportunities.“I expect us to be better against Germany. I think we’ll need to freshen the team up. It’s important to take into consideration their age and the amount they’ve played, so we’ll make sure we utilise the squad.”Slovenia started brightly and came close when Seslar’s whipped free-kick deflected inches wide of the target. Beadle was then called into action for the first time to stop Seslar’s drilled effort with his legs.England’s first chance came in the 20th minute. James McAtee, the captain, dragged his close-range effort harmlessly wide. England should have been ahead just before the half-hour when Jonathan Rowe showed great feet to get past his marker and put the ball on a plate for Nwaneri but, with the goal at his mercy, he somehow missed an easy tap-in.View image in fullscreenEngland will be back playing with a backdrop of Nitra’s castle on Wednesday when they face Germany.Photograph: Radovan Stoklasa/ReutersSlovenia started to threat again, with Seslar proving a menace as he let rip with a ferocious effort from outside the box which Beadle did well to tip over the crossbar. England again came close to an opener before the break, Elliot Anderson superbly picking out the run of Elliott. He lifted his effort over Martin Turk, the Slovenia goalkeeper, only to see the ball bounce off the upright and away from danger. Another glorious chance went begging when Tino Livramento hooked the ball into the six-yard area and McAtee directed a shot on goal but Turk was in the right place to save.Slovenia almost made England pay for those missed opportunities as another chance fell to Seslar, but he saw a curling strike saved by Beadle. The England keeper said: “There are no easy games in this tournament and Slovenia have real quality. If you can’t win the game don’t lose it, and we move on. I’m satisfied with my personal performance, but obviously disappointed we didn’t win.”Omari Hutchinson, on as a substitute, injected some pace into England’s attack and his cross found Elliott, but he could not direct his header on target.England were denied in stoppage time as Brooke Norton-Cuffy’s pinpoint cross found Jack Hinshelwood. He directed a powerful header on target but Turk tipped the ball behind and secured an important point.McAtee said: “I’m a bit annoyed at myself for the chances I missed, but the same goes for the rest of the lads. We’re disappointed with the result, but it’s a point and we’ve got another game coming up soon, so we’ll focus on that.“With my first chance I thought I was offside and for the second the lads said it was a good save, but I should have finished it. There will be some fresh legs out there against Germany, so hopefully we can get the three points and top the group, because that’s our aim.”Explore more on these topicsEuropean Under-21 ChampionshipEngland Under-21snewsShareReuse this content"

The bad news was that his Bayern Munich teammates were a little more prolific, scoring 10 between them in the opening match of theirClub World Cupcampaign.If Gianni Infantino, the Fifa president, was hopinghis expanded Club World Cup– now containing 32 teams, playing across four weeks in 11 US cities – would showcase the depth of talent in global football, this was not a good example. The statistics were excruciating: the German champions had 31 shots – 17 of them on target – to Auckland’s one, and enjoyed 72% of possession.Messi shows glimpses of his genius on Fifa’s stage of fakery as Club World Cup beginsRead moreIt took 52 years for a team to score 10 goals in a World Cup game – Hungary beat El Salvador 10-1 in 1982 – but it’s taken just two games for a team to score 10 under the Club World Cup’s new format (the largest previous win at the tournament was 6-1, when Al-Hilal beat Al-Jazira in 2021 when just seven teams took part).There is some mitigation. While many argue that talent has been diluted by expanding the number of teams at this tournament, Auckland City have been a feature of the Club World Cup for some time: they have actually played at more editions than any other team. On the other hand, they’re not even the best team in Auckland, let alone New Zealand. Auckland City are part-timers, and the city’s professional team, Auckland FC, play in Australia’s A-League.“To be proud of the players is what we’re after. It’s a dream coming from an amateur level to play in this environment,” Auckland coach Ivan Vicelich said after the match, noting that some of his players had to take time off work to play in the tournament. “You can’t hide on the field. [I’m] really proud, a lot of players put in a good amount and worked really hard.”Jamal Musiala led the way for Bayern on Sunday with a second-half hat-trick. Thomas Müller, Michael Olise and Kingsley Coman scored two each, with Sacha Boey completing the rout.Some of the fans at at TQL Stadium took the opportunity to express their feelings on the tournament’s organisers. They unfurled a banner referencingthe 2015 arrest of officials at a Swiss hotelover allegations of corruption. The banner read: “10 Years Baur Au Lac – World Football Is More Poorly Governed than Before! Smash FIFA!”Things won’t get much easier for Auckland: they play another European giant, Benfica, on Friday. Bayern play Argentina’s Boca Juniors on the same day, in what will be a tougher assignment than their opening fixture.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It has been an increasing proportion of the population since 2014.Vogue, which has run the list since 2018, pointed to Ryan’s work “lifting the lid on the government’scuts to disability benefitsor giving insight into highly emotive topics such as theassisted dying bill”. It also praised her recent book, Who Wants Normal?– published in April this year.Ryan said: “It’s ironic – or just very fitting – that I made the list in part because of a book I wrote this year arguing disabled women deserve a place in British culture.‘I’m still sick. I’m still disabled. But I’m proud of my body’: Frances Ryan’s manifesto for disabled womenRead more“I’m really touched to be included and I hope it’s another step in the climb to see many more women that look like me (and a lot that don’t).”Her recent work has included coverage of a letter signed by more than 100 of the UK’s most high-profile disabled peoplecalling on Keir Starmerto abandon “inhumane and catastrophic plans to cut disability benefits”.The Vogue 25 also recognisedAmal Clooney, the human rights barrister. She was recognised for her work defending “those who have suffered systemic abuse, particularly women and girls who have been victims of sexual violence”.It also included England footballer Lucy Bronze, whose aunt once threatened to sue the FA over a rule that meant Bronze was no longer allowed to play with boys’ teams at the age of 12. The current Chelsea full-back has played for Liverpool, Manchester City, Lyon and Barcelona.Others in the list include: Labour’s Rachel Reeves, the first female chancellor; Pamela Maynard, Microsoft’s first chief AI transformation officer; Nicola Packer,who was acquittedof having an illegal abortion’; theatre impresario Sonia Friedman; and Princess Anne.Explore more on these topicsDisabilityWomenVogueMagazinesnewsShareReuse this content"

But a high court judge, Mr Justice Saini, ruled last month that the MoD had a case to answer, because of the impact the old policy had on the women concerned.That verdict prompted the MoD to concede, in a letter sent to the women’s lawyer earlier this month. It says that Healey “now accepts” the gagging orders “were unlawful”, because they are incompatible with military personnel’s freedom of expression and other rights.The first woman, know as EPX to protect her anonymity, said she was raped by a male colleague during her initial RAF training. After making a service complaint she said she was ostracised and told the situation was her fault.Subsequently, the person accused of assaulting her was acquitted of rape at a military court, in a trial that EPX said in a statement was “poorly handled”.The second woman, PGH, said she was raped at a social event at a navy base where she, according to her own statement, was “plied with alcohol”. Military police were “very disbelieving” of her claim and “made excuses on behalf of the accused”, the high court judge said as he set out her case. No charges were ultimately brought.EPX said she had wanted to talk to the media about what happened in response to a July 2021 parliamentary inquiry. That concluded thattwo-thirds of women in the armed forceshad experienced bullying, sexual harassment and discrimination duringtheir career, and said the military was “failing to protect” female personnel.The MoD vetoed her request, citing the ban, meaning she has never been able to give her account of events in public. “I want the freedom to be able to express my views and to talk about my personal experiences in relation to any or all of the above issues, without the MoD having a veto,” EPX said in a statement of claim.The prospect of having to seek permission from superiors to speak to a journalist or MP would, EPX said, fill her with “dread and worry”. Providing enough information about her case to seek permission would amount to “a huge invasion of my personal information” and she said she had no confidence “this would be handled with sensitivity and confidentiality” by the armed forces.The two women are planning to continue their legal action because they say the MoD’s new personnel policies fail to make explicit that members of the armed forces have the right to communicate with the press and parliament on serious sexual offences and related matters.Emma Norton, from the Centre for Military Justice, who is acting for EPX and PGH, said her clients were not seeking the right to discuss classified or operational information, but instead “things which have no place in any unit of the armed forces, any other public or private sector workplace or indeed wider society, namely rape, sexual assault, misogyny and the sexual harassment of women”.Allegations of serious sexual offences, the vast majority against women, are threatening to engulf the military. In February, online forums wereflooded with testimonies of abusein the aftermath of the inquest into the death of 19-year-old gunner Jaysley Beck. She had committed suicide after allegedly being sexually assaulted by a colleague and subjected to a barrage of unwanted attention from her boss.An MoD spokesperson said: “The welfare of all our Armed Forces is an absolute priority. The relevant policies were amended and recognise the rights of all our people.“It would be inappropriate to comment further while legal proceedings are ongoing.”Explore more on these topicsMilitaryRoyal Air ForceRoyal NavyWomenRape and sexual assaultnewsShareReuse this content"

The Danish government has said Greenland “is not for sale” and only Greenlanders can determine their future.Macron’s six-hour visit was “a signal in itself” and came at the request of both Denmark and Greenland, his office said. It began with talks with the Danish and Greenlandic prime ministers, Mette Frederiksen and Jens-Frederik Nielsen, on a Danish naval frigate.The French president was also due to visit a glacier to see the effects of global heating, and to discuss how to include Greenland in EU action to aid development while “respecting its sovereignty”. A planned visit to a hydroelectric plant was cancelled.Macron said before the visit that it was aimed at preventing further “preying” on the territory. In March, the US vice-president, JD Vance,visited the Pituffik US military baseon the island, criticising Denmark for not having “done a good job by the people of Greenland” and alleging Copenhagen had neglected the territory’s security.Pituffik, on the shortest route for missiles fired from Russia at the US, is essential to Washington’s missile defence system; while Greenland’s strategic importance has risen amid a race for rare earths and as melting ice opens up new shipping routes.The US defence secretary, Pete Hegseth,last week appeared to acknowledgethat the Pentagon had developed plans to take over Greenland by force if necessary but refused to answer repeated questions about the subject at a congressional hearing.The Wall Street Journal reported last month that agency officials under the US national intelligence director, Tulsi Gabbard, were looking into Greenland’s independence movement and sentiment about US resource extraction there.Frederiksen made several visits to Paris after Trump’s threats against Greenland, which unlike Denmark is not an EU member but has an association agreement with the bloc. Copenhagen has placed orders for French-made surface-to-air missiles.Florian Vidal of the Paris-based Ifri thinktank said that for Denmark, long one of Washington’s most loyal allies inEurope, enlisting the support of the EU’s only nuclear power was a way to project hard power towards a suddenly more predatory US.Vidal said: “The Trump administration’s more aggressive posture makes the French vision of Europe, one that is more autonomous, appear more reasonable for Denmark. From a Nordic point of view,Franceis a military power that counts.”Nielsen said in April that US statements about Greenland to date had been “disrespectful” and that the island would “never, ever be a piece of property that can be bought by just anyone”.He said last week that France’s support had been evident “since the first statements about taking our land emerged” and was both “necessary and gratifying”.Explore more on these topicsGreenlandEmmanuel MacronDonald TrumpDenmarkFranceEuropeEuropean UnionnewsShareReuse this content"

The Swedish PM, Ulf Kristersson, turned up for welcome dinner on Thursday evening, and would have been about halfway through his second plate of meatballs when the first of Israel’s rockets dropped on Tehran.What better time for the prospects of world war three to go up a gear than in the middle of a Bilderberg conflab, with nuclear proliferation slated for discussion, and the heads of Nato and MI6, and two of America’s most senior military officers in the room. They’re joined in Stockholm by the CEOs of several major defence suppliers such as Palantir, Thales and Anduril. Even the quietly spoken host of the conference, Marcus Wallenberg, happens to run an arms company. He’s chair of Sweden’s largest defence contractor, Saab.The Tehran attacks slot happily into the conference agenda, which includes the topics “Middle East” and the rise of an “authoritarian axis” – what Bilderberg insider Nadia Schadlow, a former deputy US national security adviser, describes as “the growing collusion among revisionist powers”.According to Schadlow: “An authoritarian axis is rapidly coalescing around China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea, disrupting the belief that an international community has taken shape in the aftermath of the cold war.”Earlier this year, the Economist magazine, whose editor sits alongside Schadlow on Bilderberg’s steering committee, struck a similar note, declaring: “The rupture of the post-1945 order is gaining pace.” But the Economist handed Donald Trump a fair chunk of the blame for “junking the transatlantic alliance”.What this means for Bilderberg is that seven decades of hard work nurturing the postwar international order are in danger of going up in – literal – smoke.Trump’s vice-president, JD Vance, has taken every opportunity to lever the US andEuropeapart. “Europe being more independent”, he said recently, “is good for the United States.” Back last summer, before the election, he said: “The United States has to focus more on east Asia. That is going to be the future of US foreign policy for the next 40 years, and Europe has to wake up to that fact.” The presence in Stockholm of Samuel Paparo, the head of the US Indo-Pacific Command, is a sign that Bilderberg has taken this to heart. Also, there’s another member of the “authoritarian axis” which looms far larger than Iran over this conference: China.Though the name “China” doesn’t actually appear on this year’s agenda, the heightening struggle between America and China is a spectre which haunts at least half of the topics being discussed – from the “geopolitics of energy and critical minerals” to “defence innovation and resilience”.Just a couple of months ago, Eric Schmidt, the former Google boss and longtime Bilderberg board member, warned that “China is at parity or pulling ahead of the United States in a variety of technologies, notably at the AI frontier”. Schmidt suspects that it will be only a matter of “three to five years” before some form of super-intelligent AI is achieved.“The geopolitical stakes, especially in the race with China, are enormous,” he says, because attaining super-intelligent AI would mean total and unassailable military domination. In short, it would give the winner “the keys to control the entire world”.But here’s the problem – “due to the immense power requirements of large-scale AI”, beating China to the super-intelligent punch would require “potentially 100 times more energy” than is currently available.The head of the International Energy Agency, Fatih Birol, who is conferencing this year at Bilderberg, recently posted on X that “global electricity demand from data centres powering AI is set to soar in the next decade”.In this desperate winner-takes-all race for the keys to the world, in which the “geopolitics of energy” becomes ever more important, power stations – along with the data centers they feed – are going to become the No 1 military targets.Cue the AI drones.For the time being, before AI invents completely new and unimagined ways for us all to kill each other, drones are perhaps the biggest practical application of AI in warfare. There’s a healthy swarm of drone manufacturers at this year’s Stockholm summit, sharing their hopes and fears about “defence innovation”.Hovering alongside Eric Schmidt there’s the chairman of Thales – “a leader in the fast growing market of unmanned aircraft systems”. Buzzing nearby is Gundbert Scherf, co-founder of German drone and AI company Helsing. One of the early investors in Helsing is also present: the CEO of Spotify, Daniel Ek, which presumably means that the Helsing drones will have the best playlists, booming out suggested songs as they swoop down to attack.The investment interlinking of Bilderberg participants is particularly intense around autonomous drone tech. Saab is an investor in Helsing. Helsing is collaborating with leading AI company Mistral, whose CEO is attending the conference. Mistral was funded by Schmidt, who’s a huge fan of military UAVs.Schmidt’s recent AI/drone expo, which took place last month in Washington, was co-sponsored by Palantir, which was set up by Bilderberg insider Peter Thiel, who is a major funder of Anduril, whose CEO, Brian Schimpf, is also in Stockholm. Schimpf is a former employee of Palantir, whose CEO, Alex Karp, is also on board of Bilderberg, having been ushered on to it by Thiel. And so it goes.Thiel’s fingers can be found wriggling around in an awful lot of pies, not least the juiciest pie of all: the White House. The two senior White House officials at the Stockholm conference, Kevin Harrington and Michael Kratsios, both used to work for Thiel Capital. And Thiel’s famously long list of influential acolytes includes none other than Vance.Only a few days ago, Vance was on a podcast defending Trump’s proposed Palantir-powered database on every citizen, which was described by MSNBC as “an unprecedented spy machine that could track Americans”. Vance waved away any such concerns: “I don’t believe that Palantir is collecting any information.”Thank heavens for everyone’s freedoms, Palantir is run by self-confessed “classic liberal” Alex Karp. In a recent earnings call, the idiosyncratic CEO said his company was busy “building really great things”, in order “to power the west to its obvious innate superiority”.Karp throbs with what he calls “productive narcissism” – at Palantir, he insists: “We’re proud of our moral stance”. His philosophy, as he sums it up, is this: “If you’ve done something big and important, you’re probably a good person.” Palantir is successful, ipso facto, it’s doing good.As the Economist put it: “Fast approaching is a might-is-right world.” It’s a kind of Gordon Gekko morality that would be heartily approved of by Wall Street legend and Bilderberg faithful Henry Kravis of KKR, on whom Gekko was actually based.Of course, not all the tech luminaries at this year’s Bilderberg are thinking in terms of world domination.Demis Hassabis, the co-founder of DeepMind, turned up in Stockholm with the 2024 Nobel prize for Chemistry in his back pocket and some rather more optimistic rhetoric about AI, which he thinks will usher in an era of “radical abundance”. He thinks of AI as “the cavalry” arriving to save us from ourselves.He says: “I’d be very worried about society today if I didn’t know that something as transformative as AI was coming down the line.”And Jack Clark, the co-founder of Anthropic, likes to think AI replacing us in every last occupation will help us find new ways of living fulfilling lives. His vision is of a world in which, freed up from our jobs, we’ll engage in “creative, fun exercises in getting AIs to build things, or make things, or carry out competitions and games where people can play them with one another”.Pulling back for a moment from the AI endgame to the world in 2025, there’s one rather less jazzy item on the conference agenda worth mentioning – “US economy”.But even this has everything to do with China. Taking part in the Stockholm summit is Republican congressman Jason Smith, a vocal fan of Trump’s “America first” trade policy. Smith has pledged to “continue fighting to combat the economic and national security threat China poses to our great nation”. He’s fully aligned with fellow conference goer Robert Lighthizer, an influential economic adviser close to Trump, who told CBS News earlier this year that “China to me is an existential threat to the United States”.Lighthizer is urging a “strategic decoupling” from Chinese trade, and most importantly, he says: “We should disentangle our technology.”Here’s where Trump’s trade vision intersects with not just the long view of Silicon Valley’s bullish billionaires, but with the longstanding transatlantic vision of Bilderberg. Thiel recently called for “a very drastic reset with China” and urged other nations to do likewise.And this reset, he thinks, can become “the basis of how we build a stronger western alliance of the free world”.In other words, look at our success, and join us. Of course, the only thing wrong with this self-fulfilling meritocratic version of western civilization is that if the Chinese succeed in beating the west to the keys of the world, it will mean that they were the good guys after all.Explore more on these topicsBilderbergSwedenEuropefeaturesShareReuse this content"

The corridor is an ambitious project to connect 18m acres (7.3m hectares) of state and privately owned wilderness into acontiguous, safe habitatfor scores of imperilled and roaming species, including black bears, Key deer and Florida panthers.Tribal officials say they will work with the foundation and other partners to “explore the acquisition and stewardship” of land within the corridor considered important to the tribe and its community.“We have a constitutional duty to conserve our traditional homelands, the lands and waters which protected and fed our tribe since time immemorial,” said Talbert Cypress, chair of the Miccosukee Tribe headquartered on a 130-square-mile reservation west of Miami.Florida grasshopper sparrow: scientists hail resurgence of endangered birdRead more“[But] we’ve seen some sort of hesitancy a lot of times to commit to projects because of the erratic nature of how the government is deciding to spend their money or allocate money.”The agreement, announced at a summit of corridor stakeholders in Orlando last week, comes as a study by the Native American Fish and Wildlife Society (NAFWS) found that 60% of federally recognized tribes havelost grants or other federal fundstotalling more than $56m since Donald Trump took office in January.“These services are part of what we receive in lieu of all of the years of what we gave up, our land, our resources and sometimes, unfortunately, our culture and language,” Julie Thorstenson, executive director of the NAFWS,told the Wildlife Societylast month.With government funding drying up, and the future ofexisting federal land stewardship agreementsuncertain because of Trump’s sustained onslaught on the National Parks Service, Cypress said tribe leaders had re-evaluated its work with other partners.“For good reason, my predecessors had more of a standoffish approach. They went through a lot of the areas where they did deal with conservation groups, federal agencies, state agencies, pretty much not including them in conversations, or going back on their word. They just had a very different approach to this sort of thing,” he said.“My administration has taken more of a collaborative approach. We’re engaging with different organizations not just to build relationships, but fix relationships that may have gone sour in the past, or were just non-existent.”Cypress said the tribe, which already has collaborative or direct stewardship of almost 3m acres in the Everglades and Biscayne national parks, and Loxahatchee national wildlife refuge, was working to identify and prioritize land within the corridor of historical significance, and to “get those conversations going”.He said: “Financially, the tribe will invest some money, but we’ll also be instrumental in finding investors, partners interested in the same thing, which is to conserve as much of our natural habitat as possible while making room for growth and development.“We’ve shown we can do it in a sustainable way, and our voice can help in shaping the future ofFloridaas far as development goes because once a lot of the land gets developed we’re not going to get it back.“We need to do it in a way where we benefit not just ourselves in the present, but for generations in the future as well.”The Florida wildlife corridor was established in 2021 by lawmakers who approved an initial $400m for acquisition against a multi-year $2bn budget for land conservation. About 10m acres have been preserved, with another 8mconsidered “opportunity areas”in need of protection, and environmental groups warning large areas could still be lost to development.The legislature, which isweighing cuts to corridor fundingas it attempts to balance state spending, has encouraged commercial investment and partnerships. At last week’s summit, the Disney Conservation Fund announceda $1m grantfor training conservation teams and expanding public access to trails and natural areas.Explore more on these topicsNative AmericansFloridaConservationIndigenous peoplesWildlifenewsShareReuse this content"

The funding shortage amounts to cuts across the board of about 14%.Drakeford said: “We have made our position very clear with the Treasury that using the Barnett formula in this instance is a breach of the rules. If this was a one-off, we may have been able to use more of our reserves to cover the shortfall, but as it is, this will unfairly impact Wales year after year.”The bill for Scotland’s public services amounts to an estimated £700m, and about £200m in northern Ireland. The Treasury has agreed an additional £339m for Edinburgh and £146m for Belfast.Scotland’s budget is already under significant pressure from the rising cost of devolved welfare benefits, public sector pay settlements, and new policy commitments – including the mitigation of the two-child limit.Holyrood’s finance secretary, Shona Robison, has called repeatedly for the tax increase to be fully funded by the UK government. She said: “We have been calling for the UK government to abandon its employer national insurance rise, which risks damaging the economy by making it harder for businesses to take on or keep staff.“Failing that, we have asked that they fully fund this tax increase to ensure Scotland’s NHS, councils and other public services don’t lose out on vital revenue.“As such, it is deeply disappointing that the funding falls so far short of the more than £700m bill we estimate public services face. It feels like Scotland is now being punished for having decided to employ more people in the public sector and to invest in key public services.”The UK government has defended the use of the Barnett formula in calculating public sector national insurance contributions. A spokesperson said the changes were “in line with agreed funding arrangements and longstanding precedent”.However, the row has reignited a longstanding debate over whether the Barnett formula – in use since 1978 – is fit for purpose, and whether it should be reformed or scrapped in favour of a universal needs-based approach.It also adds togrowing frictionbetween the Welsh Labour and UK Labour administrations.Wales has consistently voted Labour for 100 years, and Welsh Labour has controlled the Senedd since its inception in 1999. However, with a year to go before the next Welsh elections, recent polling has suggested the party will trail in third place behind Plaid Cymru and Reform UK, with just 18% of votes, putting the first minister and Welsh Labour leader, Eluned Morgan, under pressure to differentiate her wing of the party from its Westminster counterpart.Rory Carroll contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsRachel ReevesDevolutionWalesScotlandNorthern IrelandnewsShareReuse this content"

But when dealing with issues “at the limits of human scientific knowledge and understanding”, expert witnesses could make people feel comfortable about making decisions when “quite frankly, the evidence isn’t there”, he said.Concerns over the use of expert witnesses have been raised in relation to the case of Lucy Letby, the neonatal nurse convicted of murdering seven babies. Lawyers appealing against her conviction argue that the expert evidence presented at her trial was flawed.Expert witnesses were also criticised during the Post Office scandal, where subpostmasters were convicted of stealing based on evidence from IT experts that has been subject to criticism.Expert witnesses are used in both criminal and civil courts to give information and opinion on matters relevant to the case that would be considered outside the knowledge of a judge or jury.Expert witnesses are ‘weakest link in English justice system’, says wrongly convicted surgeonRead moreThey are supposed to give an objective and unbiased opinion, according to guidelines from the Crown Prosecution Service, and can be instructed by the prosecution and the defence. But there are no formal controls on who can describe themself as an expert or training required to ensure they understand legal procedure.Jack Straw, a former justice secretary, said there was a “nagging worry” that expert witnesses were not being properly regulated.He said courts often encourage both sides to agree on using one expert witness, to save on time and costs, but “in my view this emphasises even more the need for there to be better regulation of expert witnesses” to ensure reliability.Nazir Afzal, a former chief crown prosecutor for north-westEngland, said there are “a number of issues” with the system.He said it would generally be up to a judge to decide whether somebody has the relevant expertise, which becomes more complicated if the area of expertise is related to “lived experience” rather than science. With international experts, he said, it may also be difficult for a court to verify their qualifications.He also said there were issues with “expert shopping”, where lawyers will consult different experts until they find one who will say what they need them to.The law firm Bond Solon offers expert witnesses training, and also runs an annual survey that looks at improving standards of expert evidence.More than a third of experts who responded to the 2024 survey said they had experienced “hired gun” experts in their field in the past year, referring to people who provide “evidence to substantiate the opinion preferred by the instructing party”. One in four also said they had been pressured by solicitors to produce biased opinions.Simon Berney-Edwards, the chief executive of the Expert Witness Institute, a not-for-profit membership body for expert witnesses which provides training, vetting and a directory, said there “is no bar set” to ensure people not only have the correct qualifications, but that they understand legal procedure.“There is no thing that says [expert witnesses] have to be registered with their professional body, or with any regulatory body. The onus on vetting the quality of their expert remains very much with the legal team,” he said.“Many people will say that they’re doing expert witness work but haven’t had one bit of training. Where you’ve got people that don’t understand what they’re doing, that’s where you get the problems, the possible miscarriages of justice.”Expert witnesses are paid for their time, and although in criminal cases – particularly those funded via legal aid – it is not always very lucrative, people can make large sums in civil and medico-legal work.Prof Sir Norman Williams, a former president of the Royal College of Surgeons of England, carried out a government commissionedreview into gross negligence manslaughter prosecutionsagainst medical professionals in 2018 that found widespread concern about expert witnesses.The review found issues with “the quality and consistency of opinion provided by healthcare professionals acting as expert witnesses” that may not be uncovered until trial or appeal, and made recommendations for more training.“Ideally one would like to see a system that was better regulated, but I can’t see that happening easily,” Williams said.“You have to be somewhat concerned that problems [highlighted in the review] can recur, because some cases are very complex, they’re difficult for juries to appreciate. If all the factors aren’t taken into consideration, there could be miscarriages of justice.”Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

Its data bill allowing copyrighted material to be used unless the rights holder opts out passed its final stage this week in a defeat for those fighting for further protections.The issue has caused afierce backlash from the creative sector, with artists including Elton John, Tom Stoppard, Paul McCartney and Kate Bush throwing their weight behind a campaign to protect copyrighted material.A freedom of information request showed the government’s Consult, Lex and Parlex tools designed to analyse consultations and legislative changes use base models from Open AI’s GPT, while its Redbox tool, which helps civil servants with everyday tasks such as preparing briefs, uses Open AI GPT, Anthropic’s Claude and Google Gemini.Ed Newton-Rex, the chief executive of Fairly Trained, who obtained the FoI and is campaigning against AI being trained on copyrighted material, said there was the potential for a conflict when the government was also thinking about how this sector should deal with copyright.All civil servants in England and Wales to get AI trainingRead moreHe said: “The government can’t effectively regulate these companies if it is simultaneously baking them into its inner workings as rapidly as possible. These AI models are built via the unpaid exploitation of creatives’ work.“AI makes a ton of mistakes, so we should expect these mistakes to start showing up in the government’s work. AI is so well known for ‘hallucinating’ – that is, getting things wrong – that I think the government should be keeping transparent records of Humphrey’s mistakes, so that its continuing use can be periodically reevaluated.”Shami Chakrabarti, the Labour peer and civil liberties campaigner, also urged caution and to be mindful of biases and inaccuracies such as those seen in the Horizon computer system that led to themiscarriage of justicefor post office operators.Whitehall sources said Humphrey tools all worked in different ways, but users could take different approaches to tackling “hallucinations”, or inaccuracy, and the government continually publishes evaluations about the accuracy of technology in trials. AnAI playbook for governmentalso sets out guidance to help officials make use of the technology quickly and offers advice on how to ensure people have control over decisions at the right stages.The costs of using AI in government are expected to grow as Humphrey is further rolled out but officials say prices of AI per-use in the industry have trended downwards, as models become more efficient.Whitehall sources said big projects such as the Scottish government’s use of AI to analyse consultation responses had cost less than £50 and saved many hours of work.Using the government’s AI Minute software to take notes for a one-hour meeting costs less than 50p and its early data shows that it saves officials an hour of admin each time.A spokesperson from the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology said: “AI has immense potential to make public services more efficient by completing basic admin tasks, allowing experts to focus on the important work they are hired to deliver.“Our use of this technology in no way limits our ability to regulate it, just as the NHS both procures medicines and robustly regulates them.“Humphrey, our package of AI tools for civil servants, is built by AI experts in government – keeping costs low as we experiment with what works best.”When the Guardian asked ChatGPT what base models were used for the Humphrey AI toolkit and if Open AI was involved, it replied that the information was not available.At the time the tool was announced earlier this year, the government said its strategy for spending £23bn a year on technology contracts would be changed, boosting opportunities for smaller tech startups.Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)Civil serviceComputingOpenAIGoogleIntellectual propertynewsShareReuse this content"

I thought it was a mistake because my work coach had told me it was fine. It was a really scary letter to receive,” Jones said.The case is the latest in a stream ofcarer’s allowance injusticeshighlighted by ayear- long Guardian investigationand a relatively rare case involving a young carer – most unpaid carers are much older adults.At least 144,000 UK carers are repaying more than £250m in earnings-related carer’s allowance overpayments caused by what MPs said were “human mistakes” on the part of carers and repeated DWP administrative and policy failures. Thousands of carers have been prosecuted and millions of pounds of public money wasted.The government last year vowed to reform aspects of carer’s allowance after widespread public outrage. Itcommissioned an independent reviewof carer’s allowance overpayments which is expected to report to ministers in July.View image in fullscreenJones, who cared for her mother throughout her teenage years, felt her experiences were disregarded by the DWP.Jones began caring for her mother, who has physical and mental disabilities, at the age of eight, helping around the house and with shopping, looking out for her safety, and accompanying her to hospital appointments.Being a carer affected her childhood and education, she said: “I was always quite hesitant to be away from my mum. I’d worry about her all the time when I was at school and struggle to focus. I wouldn’t want to go on sleepovers at friends’ houses.”When she turned 16 she started to claim carer’s allowance and it was only when she took up a place in 2021 on the DWP’s Kickstart scheme aimed at young people at risk of long term unemployment,introduced during Covid in 2020, that it became an issue.Jones said: “Before I’d accepted the job [though the Kickstart scheme] I told him [the job coach] I was on carer’s allowance and I told him the exact amounts I’d be on and that I’d be working from home so I’d be doing the same amount of caring as always.“He assured me that he was confident that my carer’s allowance would not be affected. I asked him a couple of times, not just one phone call. I checked again after a couple of months once I had started earning my wage, and he reassured me, so I thought at this point everything was fine.”The demand, when it came, felt massively unjust. “I’d been told by the work coach it was fine. I’d been a carer for my mum all my teenage years and felt my experiences had just been disregarded.”Under Kickstart, the DWP paid employers £1,500 a month towards wages and training costs, with participants guaranteed to be paid the equivalent of 25 hours a week at the national minimum wage. In Jones’s case, this is £656 a month, which worked out for the purposes of the DWP’s earnings rule calculation at £151 a week.Jones was taken on as a digital marketing assistant by a local firm and under carer’s allowance rules was allowed to earn up to £128 a week on top of her carer duties, equivalent to 19.5 hours at the minimum wage for 18- to 20-year-olds.Because she had unwittingly breached the weekly earnings limit, carer’s allowance rules meant she forfeited her £67.60 carer’s allowance. This “cliff edge” rule meant had she gone even £1 a week over the limit for six months she would have had to repay over £2,000.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Owing to a miscalculation, it also said that she received £164 a week instead of £151 a week.Explore more on these topicsCarersCarer's allowance crisisChildrenYoung peopleSocial careWelfareBenefitsnewsShareReuse this content"

In the Italian port of Genoa, campaigners dragged a cardboard cruise ship through the old town’s narrow alleyways to show that tourism does not fit in the city.A procession later on Sunday in Lisbon was due to involve a replica of St Anthony being “evicted” from his church and carried to the site of a prospective luxury hotel, to stress that even saints suffer from touristification.In Barcelona, an estimated 600-800 demonstrators marched through the city centre chanting “Your holidays, my misery” and waving banners with slogans such as “Mass tourism kills the city” and “Their greed brings us ruin.”Some fired water pistols, set off coloured flares and put “Neighbourhood self-defence, tourist go home” stickers on shop windows and hotels. Barcelona, a city of 1.6 million, drew 26 million tourists last year.Threading through all the actions was a rallying cry for arethink of a tourism modelthat campaigners say has increasingly funnelled profits into the hands of a few, while leaving locals to pay the price through soaring house prices and rents, environmental degradation and the proliferation of precarious, low-paying jobs.The tensions around tourism burst into public view last year aftertens of thousands of people protestedin Spain’s most popular destinations. The bulk of Sunday’s protests took place in Spain, where tourist arrivals surged last year torecord levels. Cities in Italy and Portugal also took part.Despite the spate of fear-inducing headlines in some media, the aim was not to attack tourists, said Asier Basurto, a member of the “tourism degrowth” platform that organised a march in the Basque city of San Sebastián.“People who go on vacation to one place or another are not our enemies, nor are they the target of our actions,” he said. “Let me be clear: our enemies are those who speculate on housing, who exploit workers and those who are profiting handsomely from the touristification of our cities.”View image in fullscreenTourists take selfies in Barcelona where activists met for a conference on overtourism.Photograph: Bruna Casas/ReutersThe seeds for the joint day of action were sown in April after groups from Spain, Italy,Portugaland France gathered in Barcelona for a days-long conference under the umbrella of the Southern European Network Against Touristification.“When we started speaking to each other, it was amazing,” said María Cardona, of Canviem el Rumb, or Let’s Change Course, one of the groups behind Sunday’s march in Ibiza. “Despite the distance between us, we’re all grappling with a similar problem.”In Ibiza, the march’s slogan was “the right to a dignified life”, said Cardona. “What does that mean when it comes to life on the island? There’s the right to water – we’reunder restrictions, there’s a drought, they’ve cut off all the public fountains,” she added. “But villas, hotels and luxury homes continue to fill their pools as if there were no water restrictions.”There was also the soaring cost of living that hadleft many workersliving in vans, caravans or tents. “And another thing we’re seeing is that the traditional, historical names of places are being changed to English names that locals don’t know,” said Cardona. “It’s like the island’s DNA is being transformed.”In Venice, locals protested against the lack of regulations that has allowed the number of short-term rentals to surge and hotels to tighten their grip on the housing market. “We’ve been emphasising for a couple of years now that there are more tourist beds than registered residents,” said Remi Wacogne of Ocio, acivic observatory on housing.“Tourism is physically and practically taking over homes.”The steady shift had unleashed a wave of change in the city. “One of the main businesses that keeps opening up in Venice, in addition to bars and restaurants, is ATMs,” said Wacogne. “Which is also in a sense a metaphor of what is going on. So Venice is basically an ATM for a very restricted group of people, firms and investors who are allowed to make money just out of renting the place out to people.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This is a place where people live.”Underpinning the joint action was a semantic shift. Rather than overtourism, which suggests that the solution lies in rolling back the number of tourists, the focus was on touristification, highlighting how hotspots are increasingly becoming commodified to be consumed by visitors, said Manuel Martin, of theMovement for a Housing Referendum,one of the groups organising the Lisbon action.“So it’s a shift away from being a place that exists by and for the people that live and work there,” he added.This has chipped away at the culture and social fabric of cities, added Martin, pointing to the shops and bookshops in Lisbon, some of them more than a century old, that have closed their doors after being priced out by rising rents. “It sort of excavates meaning from a place and turns it into a Disneyfied version of what it really is.”After a handful of protesters bearing water gunssquirted waterat tourists last year in Barcelona, making headlines around the world, organisers in the city said they were encouraging people to bring water guns to Sunday’s march.“But this needs to be contextualised,” said Daniel Pardo Rivacoba, of the Neighbourhood Assembly for Tourism Degrowth. Last year’s incident was covered by tabloids and other media as though it was threatening or intimidating. “The most extreme ones spoke about violence and things like that,” he said. “But a water gun is not a gun. It’s a toy. It doesn’t hurt anyone.”Campaigners in the city have adopted the water pistol as a symbol of local resistance. “To us, it is clear that it doesn’t harm anyone,” Pardo Rivacoba said. “But if we’re talking about violence, let’s talk about the violence of touristification. Let’s talk about the violence that tourism is inflicting on the city in terms of evictions, of pushing out the population, of labour exploitation, in the overload and abuse of public services.“When it comes to tourism, there is violence taking place. But it’s not because of water guns.”Additional reporting by Jon HenleyExplore more on these topicsOvertourismSpainItalyPortugalEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Or been detained at the border? Tell us your storyRead moreKitchen said officials asked him for his “thoughts about the conflict in a very broad sense”, including about student protesters, what Israel “should have done differently” and “how I would resolve the conflict”.“It was quite an in-depth probing of my views on the war,” he said.Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailKitchen said he was deported and landed back in Melbourne on Saturday morning.“The CBP explicitly said to me, the reason you have been detained isbecause of your writingon theColumbia student protests,” he told Guardian Australia on Sunday. The US Department of Homeland Security was contacted for comment.Kitchen said he lived in New York for six years and wrote about the protests staged in support of Gaza at Columbia University while he was a master’s student at the college, before he moved back to Australia in 2024.“Because I was a creative writing student, I took the opportunity to witness the protests and wrote about them in depth on my personal blog,” he said.This year, Kitchen published a piece on his blog, Kitchen Counter, on theDepartment of Homeland Security’s detention of Mahmoud Khalil, the lead negotiator of the Columbia Gaza Solidarity Encampment.In the article, Kitchen said Khalil had been arrested “on utterly specious grounds by a neo-fascist state” with the goal of “the deportation of dissent”.He referred to the Trump administration’sexecutive orderof 30 January in which the government promised to go on the “offense to enforce law and order” and “cancel the student visas of all Hamas sympathizers on college campuses”.Kitchen, who was planning to return to New York for two weeks to visit friends, said he deleted “sensitive political posts” from his blog as well as “some social media” because he was aware of the increased risk of crossing the US border.However, he believed US border officials had used technology to link his posts to his application for a Electronic System for Travel Authorization (Esta), which allows eligible visitors to make a short trip to the US without a visa.He said he was called for over the intercom shortly after exiting the plane at Los Angeles international airpot and “taken into a back room” for secondary processing“Clearly, they had technology in their system which linked those posts to my Esta … a long time before I took them down,” he said. “Because they knew all about the posts, and then interrogated me about the posts once I was there.”Kitchen said he wanted other Australians to be aware that “cleaning” their phones wouldn’t necessarily mean they would be able to get their Esta approved upon arrival in the US.“They had already prepared a file on me and already knew everything about me,” he said.Kitchen said he agreed to give officials the passcode for his phone, which he now regretted.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It also seemed to raise the risk of mistakes and wrongful arrests.Accordingly, Ice has drastically stepped up its arrest rate – and broadened the profile of those targeted.The results have been plain to see. As demonstrators took to the streets, Miller promptly raised the stakes by accusing them of an “insurrection”.Amid the hullabaloo and expressions of outrage, Miller may allowed himself a quiet smile of satisfaction over sticking it to the city of his birth – in many ways emblematic of the progressive cultural trends despised by Trump’s “Make America great again” (Maga) followers but a place where his own hardline anti-immigrant views had long provoked derision.The son of affluent Jewish parents, Miller’s evolution into a race-baiting provocateur took shape in the upscale suburb of Santa Monica, where he gained notoriety as an incendiary agitator at the eponymous local high school.Video footage purportedly from the period andcirculated on social mediashows a bearded Miller stridently voicing his disdainful view of school janitorial staff“Am I the only one who is sick and tired of being told to pick up my trash when we have plenty of janitors who are paid to do this,” he shouts into a microphone.The gross statement seems to have been representative of a broader canvas of toxic ideas, with racism at its core.InHatemonger: Stephen Miller, Donald Trump, and the White Nationalist Agenda, to date the only biography published on Miller, author Jean Guerrero recounts one episode from the future political operative’s adolescence, when he suddenly ditched a close friend, Jason Islas, on the grounds of his ethnicity.“The conversation was remarkably calm,” Islas, a Mexican American, is quoted saying. “He expressed hatred for me in a calm, cool, matter-of-fact way.”An article he wrote as a 16-year-old for a local website expresses contempt for fellow students of Hispanic origin.“When I entered Santa Monica High School in ninth grade, I noticed a number of students lacked basic English skills,” Miller wrote on the Surfsantamonica site. “There are usually very few, if any, Hispanic students in my honors classes, despite the large number of Hispanic students that attend our school.”The school, he added, was one where “Osama bin Laden would feel very welcome” – a view reflecting the then recentness of the 9/11 attacks by al-Qaida and also Miller’s increasing focus on Muslims.Miller’s indulgence in far-right ideas continued during his college years at Duke University in North Carolina, where he associated with white nationalist thinkers and groups.According to the Southern Poverty Law Center, he worked with the David Horowitz Freedom Center, which it defined as a “an anti-Muslim hate group”, and also with Richard Spencer, a white nationalist leader who popularized the term “alt-right” to describe groups that defined themselves through a white racial identity.View image in fullscreenStephen Miller, Steve Bannon, Michael Flynn, Jared Kushner and Reince Priebus, from Trump’s first term. Only Miller remains in the Trump 2.0 inner circle.Photograph: Carlos Barría/ReutersAfter graduating, Miller moved to Washington to work in Congress, serving first as a press secretary to Michele Bachmann, then a Republican representative for Minnesota, before moving to work for Jeff Sessions, at the time a rightwing Alabama senator who later became Trump’s first attorney general.It was in the latter role that his reputation as an avatar of extreme anti-immigrant agitprop became established. In 2013, helped by Miller, Sessions torpedoed a bipartisan piece of legislation that was intended to pave the way for immigration for undocumented migrants.To help sink the bill, Miller used Breitbart News, a rightwing website then headed by Steve Bannon. It would prove to be a fateful connection.The Breitbart connection also shone further light on Miller’s views on race and immigration, as revealed in emails he sent to editors and reporters.They showed a preoccupation with the 1924 Immigration Act, signed by President Calvin Coolidge, which severely restricted immigration to the US from certain parts of the world on what observers say were racial and eugenics grounds. Hitler subsequently praised the legislation as a model for Germany in Mein Kampf.After Trump launched his presidential campaign in 2015 - creating scandalizing headlines by demonizing Mexican immigrants as “drug dealers, criminals and rapists”, Miller took a leave of absence from Sessions’ Senate office to work for him.On the recommendation of Bannon, by then Trump’s campaign chief, he was installed as a speech writer, chiefly because of his focus on immigration, which had become the candidate’s own signature issue.It enabled Miller to showcase his ability to channel Trump’s inner self. The pair have politically inseparable ever since.Australian deported from US says he was ‘targeted’ due to writing on pro-Palestine student protestsRead moreMiller wrote Trump’s dystopian “American carnage” speechfor his first inauguration in January 2017. As a senior policy adviser in the first Trump administration, it was Miller who was behind some of its most notorious policy initiatives. These included the so-called “Muslim ban” on travellers from seven majority-Muslim countries and the practice of separating migrant children from their parents at the southern border.His growing notoriety as an anti-immigration extremist drew criticism from his own relatives. In 2018, his maternal uncle, David Glosser, branded him a “hypocrite” for ignoring the memory of his ancestors, who fled antisemitic pogroms in tsarist Russia.“I have watched with dismay and increasing horror as my nephew, an educated man who is well aware of his heritage, has become the architect of immigration policies that repudiate the very foundation of our family’s life in this country,” Glosser, a retired neuropsychologist,wrote in Politico.Miller cared little for such sentimentality.After Trump’s defeat to Joe Biden in the 2020 presidential election, Miller stuck with the former president – even while his political future initially looked doomed in the aftermath of the 6 January 2021 attack by his supporters on the US Capitol.Consequently, he grew ever more powerful in Trump’s inner circle. He may have earned extra kudos bydeclining to exploit their relationship to win lucrative consulting contracts, instead setting up a non-profit, the America First Legal foundation.Meanwhile, he immersed himself in studying how to overcome the hurdles that stymied Trump’s agenda during his first presidency.The outcome has been apparent in the blizzard of executive orders druing the restored president’s first months back in the White House. Miller purposely sought to “flood the zone” in a manner that would overwhelm the capacity of the courts – or the media – to respond.No order was more quintessentially Miller’s than that issued on the day of Trump’s second inauguration on 20 January, whichattempted to cancel birthright citizenshipfor children born to undocumented immigrants. The order was challenged in the courts and is now with the supreme court after the administration challenged the ability of lower courts to issue nationwide injunctions supporting a right that is guaranteed in the US constitution.Miller’s anti-immigrant zeal has at times exceeded even that of Trump. According tothe New York Times, the president told a campaign meeting last year that if it was up to Miller, there would only be 100 million people living in the US – and all of them would look like Miller.The bond between the two men has grown to such an extent that Miller has been dubbed “the president’s id” in some circles.“He has been for a while. It’s just now he has the leverage and power to fully effectuate it,” an unnamed former Trump advisertold NBC. Others have called him “the most consequential” White House official since Dick Cheney, who exercised vast influence as vice-president under George W Bush.Critics cast Miller as the root of all evil in Trump’s White House. “Stephen Miller is responsible for all the bad things happening in the United States,” NBC quoted Ben Ray Luján, a Democratic senator for New Mexico, as saying.Miller’s exalted place at Trump’s side was illustrated during the recent Signalgate episode –as revealed by the Atlantic, whose editor, Jeffrey Goldberg, was inadvertently invited into a government chat group to discuss airstrikes on Houthi militants in Yemen, whose missile attacks on Israel threatened Suez canal shipping routes.When JD Vance questioned the strikes – asking whether Trump “is aware how inconsistent this is with his message on Europe” – Miller unambiguously slapped the vice-president down.“As I heard it, the president was clear: green light,” Miller said, according to the transcript.The clearest testimony to Miller’s status has come from Trump himself. Asked by Kristen Welker, the moderator of NBC’s Meet the Press, about speculation that Miller might become national security adviser, a usually influential White House post currently filled, albeit temporarily, by the secretary of state, Marco Rubio, after the previous incumbent, Mike Waltz, was fired.“Stephen is much higher on the totem pole than that,” Trump replied.The result is that Miller’s presence is detectable in all policy areas, including at the state department, where he succeeded in having his ally, Christopher Landau, installed as Rubio’s deputy.The goal is to control the flow of foreigners entering the United States, insiders have told the Guardian.Ice arrests of migrants with no criminal history surging under TrumpRead moreAt the state department, Landau has become an important liaison to officials in the consular affairs section, which has been put under the leadership of a conservative coterie of diplomats and reoriented toward policing migration.Officials from the state department have joined FBI agents on recent Ice raids aimed at tracking down unregistered migrants.Tara Setmayer, a former Republican communications director on Capitol Hill, laments that Miller’s rising star means he can “use the powers of the federal government to unleash his fascist worldview”.“[That view] has now been transformed into the main political policy and aim of Donald Trump’s presidency,” said Setmayer, who now heads the Seneca Project, a women-led political action committee.“The demagoguery of immigration has long been at the centre of Donald Trump’s political rise, and Stephen Miller’s desire to make America whiter and less diverse, married with the power of the presidency without guardrails, is incredibly dangerous and should concern every American who believes in the rule of law.”Andrew Roth and David Smith contributedreportingExplore more on these topicsUS immigrationTrump administrationFar right (US)Donald TrumpRaceRepublicansUS politicsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The 23-year-old had recently graduated with a bachelor’s degree in nanoengineering from the University of California, San Diego, into a fiercely competitive job market. He felt like he’d struck gold.But the relentless cuts to scientific research andattacks on higher educationby theTrump administrationhave turned what felt like a promising academic future into unstable ground.“There are several labs, both at our institution and around the US, that have essentially just sent everyone home because they have no money,” Schuster said, expressing concern not just for oceanography but for all fields of scientific research. The multi-pronged attacks have “been seriously detrimental to just about everyone”, he said.Though Schuster is grateful for his position, he is in a constant state of worry about whether it will still exist tomorrow. UCSD, which SIO is a part of, told the Guardian that theTrump administrationhas ended or frozen roughly $90m in grants from the National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation. Nearly 200 other grants are facing delays. SIO researchers have noted that the “vast majority” of their funding comes from the government.Schuster has decided he’s not going to stick around to see if he will lose his job.View image in fullscreenEric Schuster, 23, is leaving the US in the fall to start his graduate studies in France.Photograph: Eric Schuster/CourtesyHe’ll be starting his graduate studies this fall in France with a European University Networks (EUN) program, a transnational alliance of higher education institutions.

Historically, the US has attracted top talent from around the world, but the moves by the Trump administration may have reversed these conditions in record time.Research institutions are feeling the strain from funding cuts from some of the biggest grant-making bodies in the world. The National Science Foundation (NSF)funds about 25%of federally backed basic research at US universities, but Trump’sproposed budgetwould cut over $5bn, or 57%, from its budget, chopping it from roughly $9bn down to $3.9bn. The US National Institutes of Health would lose about 40% of its budget compared to last year.US universities are moving to the right. Will it help them escape Trump’s wrath?Read moreBut those cuts aren’t the only cause for anxiety. Nerves throughout the scholarly community are also on edge given what is widely perceived as a historic attack on academic freedom through administration assaults against universities suchColumbiaandHarvardUniversity under the guise of rooting out antisemitism and diversity, equity and inclusion programs. Dozens more universities are waiting for their turn.‘The situation is just too volatile’A recentNature surveyrevealed that approximately 75% of US-based scientists are contemplating relocation, with early-career researchers and PhD students particularly inclined toward opportunities in Canada, Europe and Australia.Valerio Francioni is one of them. A 32-year-old Italian citizen who moved to the US after getting his PhD at the University of Edinburgh, Francioni is now a postdoctoral research scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology studying neuroscience.International students have faced nonstop chaos in the past few months, fromvisa suspensionsto theattempted deportationsof several students whoexpressed supportfor Palestinians. Last month, the Trump administration ordered US embassies worldwide to immediatelystop scheduling visa interviewsfor foreign students as it prepares to implement comprehensive “social media screenings” for all international applicants.View image in fullscreenMIT is among the numerous universities facing substantial grant cuts and financial pressures from the Trump administration.Photograph: Scott Eisen/Getty Images“As an international, there’s just no way that you can invest safely into a career here right now, there’s just no way to plan ahead. The situation is just too volatile to feel that you’re making a safe investment by being here,” Francioni said.A recentreport from the Economistsuggests that international students (and some domestic) are losing interest in American PhD programs. Searches for US PhD programs on the website FindAPhD fell 40% year on year in April, while interest from students in Europe has fallen by 50%. Data from another website,Studyportals, shows a decrease in interest for domestic PhDs among Americans, and a rise in interest for international programs compared to the previous year.I don’t want to live in a country that does not abide by the laws that they have set in stone ... It has deeply troubled meCarter Freshour, Thunderbird School of Global ManagementThough his own visa has not been affected yet, Francioni plans to leave the US once his run at MIT is finished. He had wanted to stay in Boston – it’s a great place for people in the neurotech field, he says, and his American partner is there. But his calculus has changed in the past few months.Kristina, originally from Sweden, is grappling with the same questions. A mathematics professor at a university in the north-east US, Kristina requested that only her first name be used and her institution not be named over concerns of retaliation by the Trump administration.“Right now, I think that everyone who’s not a citizen feels that we cannot express our opinions,” Kristina said.She’s been in the US for 25 years, but does not have US citizenship. She is now debating whether to stay or leave. To her, the question is a moral one, whether to leave for safety or stay to “fight for a more democratic future”.View image in fullscreenEmmanuel Guerisoli, a French and Italian academic finishing his postdoc at the New School, plans to leave the US for Argentina.Photograph: Emmanuel Guerisoli/CourtesyEmmanuel Guerisoli, a French and Italian academic with a PhD in sociology and history, moved to the US in 2010 to pursue a masters in sociology. He is now finishing a postdoc at the Zolberg Institute on Migration and Mobility at the New School.Guerisoli is concerned about being targeted by Ice because of discussions he has led in class on the war in Gaza. He was offered a tenure-track position at a different institution, he said, but it was quickly rescinded, which he was told was due to the Trump administration’s funding cuts.He gave up on applying to academic jobs in the US and decided to move to Argentina this summer, where the dread of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) agents knocking down his door will not follow him every day.“It’s not just that you’re being questioned on your political beliefs, but any type of critical or academic engagement on certain topics that go beyond the realm of just politics are being targeted,” he said.“Even if the state department renews my visa, I would be concerned about teaching courses the way I have done it in the past,” he said.Filling the voidScholars at Risk, which assists academics facing political pressure, saw this coming.“The recent policies have created a tremendous amount of anxiety,” Robert Quinn, the group’s executive director, said. He worries the loss will have ripple effects far beyond campus.“When a big economic contributor gets disrupted, that’s going to begin to affect everybody relatively quickly in those communities,” Quinn said. “Beyond that is the effect on public health. If we look at the cutting of the research pipeline, that means fundamentally cutting off access to services and medicines and treatments that affect every American who happens to get sick.”Why Trump is really going after HarvardRead moreQuinn says that Scholars at Risk is working on ways to support US academics exploring foreign opportunities.Several other countries are jumping in to fill the void, and have already begun courting American academics.The European Union has pledged €500m (around $556m)over the next two yearsto become a prime destination for displaced scientists. France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, announced $113m for a national program to bring in American researchers, and Aix-Marseille University separately announcedSafe Place for Science, a three-year, $16.8m program to attract 15 American scientists working in climate, health and astrophysics.A university spokesperson previously told the Guardian thatmore than 60 applicationshave been received, 30 of them coming within the first 24 hours.View image in fullscreenResearchers at the Aix-Marseille University in Marseille, France, in 2023.

In awidely shared Instagram post, the head of the Danish chamber of commerce directly invited American scientists to consider Denmark, “a place where facts still matter”.‘Insidious fear’ fills universities as Trump escalates conflict during commencement seasonRead moreSweden’s education ministerheld a roundtableof university leaders to strategize on attracting frustrated US talent, and publicly called for American scientists to relocate.Canadian institutions are following a similar path. The University Health Network in Toronto and associated foundations are investing CA$30m ($21.5m) tobring in 100 early-career scientistsfrom the US and beyond. Meanwhile, the University of British Columbiareopened graduate applicationsin April specifically to accommodate interested US students.Carter Freshour, a 22-year-old US citizen, had just begun his masters program in business at the Thunderbird School of Global Management in Arizona when Trump took office.As soon as the attacks on higher education began, he dropped out of the program out of fear of the direction the country is heading. He is now in the process of moving to Madrid, where he will finish his business degree, and then plans to move to Portugal.“I don’t want to live in a country that does not abide by the laws that they have set in stone,” Freshour said. “It has deeply troubled me, the direction that the United States is going.”"

The only available diversion was a button that delivered a painful electric shock.Almost half of theparticipants pressed it. One man pressed the button 190 times – even though he, like everyone else in the study, had earlier indicated that he found the shock unpleasant enough that he would pay to avoid being shocked again. The study’s authors concluded that “people prefer doing to thinking”, even if the only thing available to do is painful – perhaps because, if left to their own devices, our minds tend to wander in unwanted directions.Since the mass adoption of smartphones, most people have been walking around with the psychological equivalent of a shock button in their pocket: a device that can neutralise boredom in an instant, even if it’s not all that good for us. We often reach for our phones for something to do during moments of quiet or solitude, or to distract us late at night when anxious thoughts creep in. This isn’talwaysa bad thing – too much rumination is unhealthy – but it’s worth reflecting on the fact that avoiding unwanted mind-wandering is easier than it’s ever been, and that most people distract themselves in very similar, screen-based ways.Most psychologists would agree that, while it can feel unpleasant, getting bored is usefulSmartphones have also increased the pressure to use our time productively, to optimise every minute of our lives. If once a harried commuter might have been forced to stare out of the window or read a book on the train to work, now they may try to catch up on their emails to avoid feeling guilty and inefficient. To sit and do nothing is seen as a waste of time. But that ignores the fact that when we’re doing nothing we’re often thinking quite hard. What happens to all those difficult or untamed half-thoughts that start to form in the milliseconds before we dig into our pockets and pull out our phones again?Most psychologists studying boredom would agree that, while it can feel unpleasant, it’s useful. Like hunger or loneliness, it alerts us to a need, a desire to do something different. According to Erin Westgate, assistant professor of psychology at the University of Florida, we become bored if something fails to absorb our attention, or when we perceive it as meaningless. This is not to say that something needs to be both engaging and meaningful to keep us interested: doing sudoku might be absorbing but relatively meaningless, while reading a Peppa Pig bedtime story for the 500th time is not engaging but may nonetheless feel like a meaningful thing to do. Watching paint dry is both unstimulating and pointless, which is why it isn’t a common pastime.In any case, when boredom strikes it should ideally serve as a prompt to do something more engaging or meaningful. If you don’t react appropriately to your boredom, or perhaps if engaging or meaningful things aren’t available to you for whatever reason, you may find yourself becoming chronically bored. That isassociated with a range of problems, including depression, anxiety, poor life satisfaction, lower academic achievement, substance abuse and excessive risk-taking.There is evidence to suggest that chronic boredom is becoming more common, and that this uptick has coincided with the rise of smartphones. In apaper published last year, researchers noted that the proportion of students in China and the US who described themselves as bored steadily increased in the years after 2010, during the first decade of smartphone dominance. Why might digital media have this effect? Research has shown that the main reason we pick up our phones or check our socials is to relieve boredom, but that the behaviour actually exacerbates it. One study, for instance, found that people who were bored at work were more likely to use their smartphones – andsubsequently feel even more bored.It may be that checking your phone only addresses part of what you need when you start to feel bored. Digital devices are very good at attracting your attention – in fact, everything you interact with on a screen has been designed to capture, hold and monetise it – but much of what we do online doesn’t feel meaningful. It’s incredibly easy to plan to look at your phone for just five minutes and resurface two hours later with Mastermind-level knowledge of the latest Blake Lively controversy or your ex’s holiday plans. The average American spendsmore than four hours a day ontheir smartphone and more than seven hours a day in total online. That adds up to spending 17 years of your adult life browsing the internet. I expect that even the biggest technophiles would agree that this isn’t how they want to spend their one precious life.Phones’ efficacy at whisking us into superficial stimulation short-circuits our boredom and allows us to swiftly evade messages that we might need to hear, such as “Why am I feeling this?” or “What do I need that I’m not getting?” If we pause and listen, then perhaps we can make a choice rather than being manipulated by software engineers. When boredom strikes, we should resist the urge to assuage it instantly and ask ourselves: are we in search of pure entertainment or something more purposeful, an opportunity to connect with friends or our community or something different, something new? The people who choose to embrace boredom, at least for a while, may paradoxically experience less of it. It could even be the first step towards a life that feels more stimulating overall: meaningful, creative and free.Further readingBored and Brilliantby Manoush Zomorodi (Pan Macmillan, £14.99)Digital Minimalismby Cal Newport (Penguin, £10.99)The Antidoteby Oliver Burkeman (Vintage, £10.99)Explore more on these topicsPsychologyThe big ideaInternetSmartphonesMobile phonesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The secret, says creator Kat Sadler: dealing with things in ‘the most unenlightened way possible’Sun 15 Jun 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 15 Jun 2025 05.02 EDTShareFew writers take criticism well, fewer actively court it. Kat Sadler, however, has an insatiable appetite for negative feedback. When crafting her BBC sitcom Such Brave Girls, the 31-year-old frequently runs the scripts past her younger sister and co-star Lizzie Davidson – but she isn’t looking for praise. Instead, “she wants you to tear it to pieces”, says Davidson. “She loves it.”“I get off on it,” confirms Sadler, with matter-of-fact melancholy.“You’re like: yeah, yeah, yeah,” says Davidson, mimicking her sister’s dismissive response to compliments. “Now tell me what you didn’t like about it.”Unfortunately, Sadler’s masochistic streak isn’t getting much gratification at the moment: where Such Brave Girls is concerned, complaints have been very thin on the ground. The first series of this vicious and relentlessly outrageous BBC sitcom – in which Sadler and Davidson play Josie and Billie, a pair of desperate, delusional, self-obsessed sisters tiptoeing around their perpetually furious mother – was met with a unanimously enthusiastic response from critics when it aired in the winter of 2023: a slew of award nominations followed; soon after, it won the Bafta for best scripted comedy.This was an exceptional achievement for two reasons. First, because the pair’s success seemed to come out of nowhere. Sadler had been a joke writer for hire onTV comedyentertainment shows (Mel Giedroyc: Unforgivable; Joe Lycett’s Got Your Back), while Davidson was an aspiring actor marooned in interactive children’s entertainment (a particular grim job at a Shrek-themed show attracted bratty kids who seemed to enjoy insulting the cast). Second, because Such Brave Girls was a product of extreme low points in both their lives: during lockdown, the sisters had a phone call in which Davidson confessed she had accrued £20k of debt and Sadler revealed she had been sectioned after trying to end her life twice.View image in fullscreenAll at sea … Kat Sadler and Lizzie Davidson in Such Brave Girls.Photograph: Vishal Shama/BBC/Various Artists LimitedMiraculously, the pair managed to see the funny side, and decided to channel their collective misery into a sitcom – keeping Sadler’s mental health issues for Josie, but transferring Davidson’s debt to their fictional mother, Deb. The result is a remorselessly hilarious show about depression, anxiety, sexuality, abandonment, dysfunctional relationships and poverty that never gets close to worthy, earnest dramedy; something you could probably predict from the very first episode, in which Deb orders Josie – who has been experiencing low moods and panic attacks – to cheer up as her “haunting presence” is negatively affecting Deb’s new boyfriend’s libido.I first spoke to the pair a couple of weeks before series one aired. At that point, the sisters (who have different surnames as Sadler is a stage name) were giddy with nerves, grappling with the surreal prospect of their semi-autobiographical sitcom being broadcast to the nation; each day Davidson would refresh the TV planner in the hope of glimpsing it in the schedules. We meet again in December 2024, on the set of series two. Since the show’s rapturous reception and Bafta win – an invitation to the British comedy firmament if ever there was one (past winners have included The Office, Peep Show, The Thick of It and Derry Girls) – I assume their lives have been transformed into a whirlwind of showbiz thrills. Have they?Josie is such a pure narcissist. She really believes she’s the main character – everything revolves round herKat Sadler“I wish they had,” says Sadler, eating lunch in a shabby makeshift green room during a brief break from filming. “You need to hear about the day we won the Bafta. It was just weird.” The pair got an Uber home from the ceremony, “and it was just like: well, back to our lives. I got up the next morning, went to the office and carried on writing.” Meanwhile, Davidson – a gifted comic actor – immediately went back to her job in a clothing shop. “And nobody said anything!” says Sadler, still astonished. “I didn’t even take my makeup off from the night before, I just turned up and was like: hey guys!” Davidson recalls. Having envisaged a victorious return to the shop floor, she was quickly brought back down to earth. “[My colleagues] were just like: the shoes are there,” Davidson sighs. She’s due to go back to her day job the month after we speak.The pair may not feel like superstars, but the Such Brave Girls set certainly has a buzz about it. Although the action is set in the West Sussex commuter town of Crawley, the show’s interior scenes are filmed in a defunct school on the outskirts of Liverpool, and the BBC’s director of comedy Jon Petrie and two other senior producers have also made the long journey north-west to check in on one of their hottest properties. Britcom giant Simon Bird, AKA Will from The Inbetweeners – who wrote Sadler a letter asking if he could work on the series after falling in love with the pilot – is once again in the director’s chair (in this case, one of the chintzy armchairs in the sisters’ fictional living room). I watch Sadler and Davidson perform a two-hander, which differs markedly from that day’s script; the pair alter and edit the words as they go along, sometimes for clarity, sometimes for extra laughs and sometimes just because someone forgot a couple of their lines.View image in fullscreenMother load … Louise Brealey (right) with Paul Bazely in Such Brave Girls.Photograph: James Stack/BBC/Various Artists LimitedIt is clear that Sadler is genuinely not precious about her dialogue; Bird also seems very relaxed about the on-camera brainstorming. “There’s lots of flexibility, but you also get that sense that Kat knows what it is,” says Sherlock’s Louise Brealey, who plays the sisters’ mother, Deb. “They’re guardians of their characters,” says Sadler, about the cast. “So often the thing they want to change is right. It will be something I haven’t noticed.” Brealey plays Deb as a fellow Northamptonshire native, so usually makes minor changes to the phrasing to suit her accent, which she amps up for the show. “You do an accent?” chips in Davidson, with mock confusion.Brealey rolls her eyes. “They tease me, this is a running joke.”“It’s so subtle,” continues Davidson, as the sisters descend into hysterics.“Get fucked,” says Brealey. “My real voice is posh!”It is hard to imagine Josie and Billie baiting Deb with such impunity: the Such Brave Girls matriarch is an extraordinarily cynical, appearance-obsessed woman on the verge, desperate to hang on to her man/meal ticket Dev (Benidorm’s Paul Bazely) and ready to brutally lay into her firstborn at a moment’s notice (her targets include Josie’s ketchup usage, depressive episodes, unshaven legs, round shoulders and androgynous dress sense). Is she going to be as horrible in series two? Sadler jumps to her defence: “I don’t think she’s horrible, I think she doesn’t mince her words.” Brealey isn’t so sure. Actors are meant to be eternally sympathetic to their characters, she says, but “I would say she’s pretty much a monster”.Brealey is clearly very different from Deb: effusive and extroverted, she sings loudly while having her makeup touched up and cringes as she recalls filling pauses in production by performing showtunes for the crew. Josie and Billie, on the other hand, began life as exaggerated versions of the sisters themselves. As well as her mental health issues, Josie shares Sadler’s belief that trauma is an interesting personality trait; ever the self-flagellator, she seems to revel in sending herself up. Josie, she insists, “is the worst one, because she’s such a pure narcissist. She really believes she’s the main character – everything revolves round her.”View image in fullscreenCake walkthrough … Simon Bird directing Such Brave Girls.Photograph: Vishal Sharma/BBC/Various Artists LimitedLike her character, the real-life Sadler comes across as thoughtful and amenable – but doesn’t share her fictional alter ego’s cartoonish passivity; Josie is people-pleasing to the point of ridiculousness. Davidson, meanwhile, tells me she identifies with Billie’s “obsession with attention”, which her character often attracts via aggro melodrama. In person, she is mischievously irreverent but far more laid-back than Billie, who also works in the bleak world of children’s entertainment (an opportunity for many strikingly incongruous costume choices; in one episode she arrives at an abortion clinic dressed as a witch).Series one of Such Brave Girls covered Josie’s attempts to get a girlfriend while blocking out the constant presence of her clammy, cockroach-like boyfriend Seb (Freddie Meredith), while Billie pursued her noncommittal “soulmate” Nicky (Sam Buchanan) with unhinged devotion. In the final episode, the pair attend their paternal grandmother’s funeral, hoping to confront their father, who popped out for teabags a decade ago and never came back. (When I tell Sadler I’d presumed that bit hadn’t actually happened, she replies: “No, not teabags.”) If series one was the long-awaited debut – into which Sadler could channel all the rich raw material she had accrued over her lifetime – series two is the difficult second album, requiring less literal truth and more imagination.Sadler initially didn’t let herself think about a follow-up – it would have been “too heartbreaking” if it hadn’t been recommissioned (“Like: what do I do with all these thoughts?!”). The writing process was daunting and exhausting. “I have gone loopy. Lizzie’s had to do a lot of mental health work on me this year to keep me going,” says Sadler. “A lot of phone calls, a lot of day trips, a lot of shopping,” nods Davidson. A breakthrough came when Sadler decided to turn up the intensity: the money aspect is “more stressful, the house is more cramped – everybody’s stuck”. Her north star was a determination “to make everyone’s lives worse”. I can confirm that series two is Such Brave Girls “squared”, as Brealey puts it: all the women’s romantic, financial and existential problems remain but intensified to nightmarish proportions.Sadler also decided to make a list of hot-button topics to weave into the script: “stuff that had been annoying me in the news or a concept I’d seen people get irritated about online. Then I’d think: how would our characters deal with that?” The answer, usually, is in the most unenlightened way possible: in series one, depression is an irritant, not conforming to beauty standards is “selfish”, therapists are cashing in on other people’s misery, trauma is a turn-on, sex is just something to “get through”, and suicide is used as emotional blackmail. Series two, meanwhile, mercilessly satirises the idea of contented singledom, and puts uproariously novel spins on age-gap affairs and coercive control.Such Brave Girls review – properly brutal and properly funnyRead moreThis is one of the secrets of Such Brave Girls’ success: it combines contemporary relevance – the show is essentially about a depressed woman grappling with her sexuality – with an utter lack of compassion and empathy. Yet while the show rebels against the sanctimony that has plagued modern comedy, it doesn’t hark back to old-school political incorrectness. The jokes about Josie’s exponentially serious mental health issues do not punch down because they closely mimic Sadler’s own experiences. “If you lived it, if it has truth, you can get away with anything,” she says.Still, in a landscape of warm, big-hearted, issue-led comedy, Such Brave Girls feels deliciously risque. For series two, Sadler was focused on “how nefarious we can make our characters” and “who else we can annoy with our show”. “How much offence we can cause,” adds Brealey. Does Sadler think the show caused offence? “I don’t really look online at that stuff,” she says, brow furrowed.If she had, she wouldn’t have found much pushback. Such Brave Girls has achieved a rare feat: a not safe, not nice and genuinely boundary-pushing sitcom that hasn’t caused any discernible upset. Which, for a criticism junkie like Sadler, might not be the news she was hoping for.Series two of Such Brave Girls airs on 3 July on BBC Three and iPlayer.The charityMindis available on 0300 123 3393 andChildlineon 0800 1111.In the US, call or textMental Health Americaat 988 or chat 988lifeline.org.

Staff were given Orwellian instruction to inform the government of any attempt to disguise inclusion efforts in “coded or imprecise language”. In the weeks to follow, Nasa wouldtake back its promiseto send the first woman and person of color to the moon’s surface. Meanwhile, employees are reported to be hiding their rainbow flags and any other expressions of solidarity with the LGBTQ+ community, allegedly because they were instructed to do so though Nasa denies those claims.“The pride flag flew in space a couple years ago,” says Cristina Costantini, the director of Sally, on a Zoom call with the Guardian. “Now allNasaemployees are being asked to take down any representations of pride.”‘Absolutely shocking’: Netflix documentary examines how the Titan sub disaster happenedRead moreCostantini calls the developments sad, especially because such harmful silencing contributes to the very atmosphere that made her film’s subject hide her own queer identity throughout her celebrated career. Sally Ride, who made history when she rode the space shuttle Challenger into the stars on 18 June 1983, was a lesbian. The public, and so many who knew Ride personally, only found out that part of her legacy after she died of cancer in 2012.Ride’s obituaryidentified Tam O’Shaughnessy as her partner of 27 years.O’Shaughnessy is a key voice in Sally, a National Geographic documentary revisiting everything we thought we knew about Ride – from her astronomic accomplishments to the infuriating sexism she confronted at Nasa and in the media, with reporters questioning how she would dress, whether space travel would affect her ovaries and if she would buckle and cry in the face of daunting challenges. But now there’s the extra dimension, the part of Ride kept tragically buried because of the institutionalized homophobia we see resurfacing today. “We made this movie not thinking it was particularly controversial,” says Costantini. “We had no idea it would be this relevant.”Costantini is speaking from her Los Angeles office in Atwater Village, a photo of a space shuttle and another of Ride on the Challenger mission hovering just behind her. The investigative reporter turned film-maker – who grew up wanting to be a scientist and made her feature debut co-directing the Sundance audience award winnerScience Fair– describes Ride as a major influence on her life. She remembers researching the astronaut as a young child on an old Encarta Encyclopedia CD-Rom for a book report. In grade three, Costantini contributed to a class mural where the students in her Milwaukee school painted their heroes on a wall. Ride is drawn standing alongside Brett Favre and Michael Jordan – a small sampling of the heroes that fed childhood aspirations in the mid-90s, says Costantini.With Sally, Costantini is returning to her icon’s story with a canvas bigger than either a book report or mural, but an even more challenging story to tell.“The film is really two stories interwoven,” says Costantini. “It’s the public and the private Sally. The public Sally is so well-documented that it’s a problem. We had to bring in 5,000 reels from the Nasa archive and sort through and sound sync all of them. That was a monumental task.“And then the other task is the private story, maybe the more interesting story, which has no documentation at all. There are only five really good pictures of [Sally and her partner, Tam] together that we had. You can’t build a love story out of showing people the same five pictures over and over again. For that we had to kind of invent our own cinematic romantic language.”Costantini’s doc pairs narrations from O’Shaughnessy and others who were close to Ride with animation and 16mm visuals. They express the love, the excitement of first relationships, the heavy toll from keeping these feelings secret and the sting when Ride – whose noted emotional reserve is making more and more sense – would behave inexplicably.“Sally is a very confusing central subject in some ways,” says Costantini, remarking on how Ride didn’t always make for a picture-perfect feminist hero, the uneasiness going a long way to make her even more compelling. The director refers to a story recounted by fellow astronaut Kathryn Sullivan. During the race to become the first American woman to go to space, Ride sabotaged a Nasa exercise Sullivan was working on. Talking heads mull whether that was an example of Ride’s prankster sense of humour, or a cutthroat competitive nature that flew in the face of female solidarity and sisterhood. “She didn’t leave tell all diaries or an audio journal of how she was feeling in every single moment. So we’re left to interpret later on what her choices were, and why she did what she did.”View image in fullscreenTam O’Shaughnessy and Sally Ride in Sydney, Australia, in 2004.Photograph: Photo courtesy of Tam O’ShaughnessyCostantini also points to Ride’s five-year marriage to fellow astronaut Steve Hawley. The union in retrospect can be seen as a betrayal of who she was, and the LGTBQ+ movement that she never publicly aligned with. But it was also a necessary and sacrificial career move to make her dream possible, deflecting any suspicions about sexual orientation while making Ride a more ideal candidate to make history and inspire young women. “People didn’t like women in space,” says Costantini. “And they especially didn’t like single women in space. Some of the male astronauts were, like: ‘Well, it was a good look for her not to be single and in space.’”When Ride does climb above the atmosphere on her historic mission, there’s a cathartic moment where the tense conflicts within her – or put upon her – are either resolved or abandoned, if only temporarily.Liza: A Truly Terrific Absolutely True Story review – dazzling glamour and true gritRead more“I loved being weightless,” says Ride, while in space, her recorded words packing new mean considering all the burdens we now understand. “It’s a feeling of freedom.”“She escaped Earth’s orbit – Earth’s gravity – metaphorically too,” says Costantini, on that pivotal moment in American history and Ride’s personal life. “Looking at the Earth from space, she started to, for the first time, really think about the imaginary lines that we have. She was struck by the fact that all these countries have known borders around them. These are human constructions. As Tam says in the film, the lines between genders, the lines between race, the lines between countries, who we’re allowed to love, those are meaningless constructs.“Space was transformative for her. When she came back to Earth, she finally allowed herself to be who she really is, and love who she really loved.”Sally premieres on National Geographic on 16 June and is available on Hulu and Disney+ on 17 JuneExplore more on these topicsDocumentary filmsNasaSpaceLGBTQ+ rightsGenderfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Spark believed herself wired into this process. The novelist was aware from the start of “a definite ‘something beyond myself’”, an “access to knowledge that I couldn’t possibly have gained through normal channels”.“Somehow things happened, odd things, when Muriel was around,” recalled her friend Shirley Hazzard. “Everything that happened to Muriel,” according to her American editor Barbara Epler, “had been foreseen”, usually in her books themselves. If Spark wrote about blackmail, she too would be blackmailed; if she wrote about a burglary, she would then be burgled. Thirty years after toying with an idea for The Hothouse by the East River (1973), in which electrocution by lightning takes place down a telephone line, lightning struck Spark’s house in Italy, sending a current of electricity through the external wires and burning her upper lip.Muriel Spark was born in February 1918. In a 1975 essay called The First Year of my Life, she described how she was a “transmitter”, able to tune in from her parents’ tenement flat on the first floor of 160 Bruntsfield Place, Edinburgh, to scenes and conversations from around the globe. When she was 10 days old, she wrote, Tsar Nicholas II appeared on her frequency. Aged 15 days she received news about the German spring offensive. Speeding through the wavebands, she caught Picasso’s marriage to Olga Khokhlova, and Virginia Woolf yawning. Aged six months, she said, the Romanovs’ execution was broadcast to her live.Spark lived, she explained, in the future rather than the present tense, which is one reason for her celebrated flash-forwards whereby the narrator tells us, when a character is introduced, how they will die. Mary Macgregor, for example, in The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie, “at the age of 23 lost her life in a hotel fire”. Spark joked about her foresight but it unnerved her, particularly in relation to her first novel, The Comforters.In May 1954, when she was a 36-year-old divorcee making a living of sorts as a biographer and critic, Spark converted to Catholicism. The previous year, having broken off with her lover and literary collaborator, Derek Stanford, she moved into a London bedsit. By January 1954 she was having a breakdown, brought on by overwork, spiritual and emotional stress, a baked bean diet and an excess of Dexedrine, an amphetamine she took for weight loss, one of whose side effects was hallucinations.Spark’s foresight unnerved her, and in 1954 she had a breakdown, caused by stress and too much DexedrineSpark’s collapse, described by her doctor as “anxiety neurosis”, took the form of a persecution complex about TS Eliot, whom she believed to be sending her hostile messages in the programme notes of his play The Confidential Clerk, and in his blurbs for Faber. Eliot’s words, jumping about on the page, reshaped themselves into anagrams: “lived”, for example, became “devil”. Eliot had also, Spark believed, broken into her flat to raid her larder; he was posing as the window cleaner to her friends the Braybrookes, in order to pry into their papers. Afraid of being followed, she wore dark glasses when she left the house, and spoke sotto voce. Her doctor prescribed the anti-psychotic Largactil, and in October 1954 Spark went to a Carmelite retreat at Allington Castle in Kent, where she turned her experience into her first novel. Her recovery took place as the novel evolved.In The Comforters the heroine, Caroline Rose, who is recovering from a breakdown brought on while writing a book on the modern novel (“I’m having difficulty with the chapter on realism”), has her thoughts repeated by the tap-tappity-tap of an invisible typewriter and the chanting of voices. “A typewriter and a chorus of voices: What on earth were they up to at this time of night? Caroline wondered. But what worried her were the words they had used, coinciding so exactly with her own thoughts.”No sooner has Caroline expressed to herself this worry than the typewriter starts tapping and the voices repeat her thought: “What on earth were they up to at this time of night? Caroline wondered. But what worried her were the words they had used, coinciding so exactly with her own thoughts”. A “typing ghost”, Caroline believes, is turning her into a character in a novel.Spark found her voice as a novelist in a novel about hearing voices – tuning into ‘voices in the air’ is how she described her writing processShe wires her former boyfriend, Laurence, saying “Come immediately something mysterious going on”, at the same time as Laurence wires Caroline with the exact same words. The Comforters ends with Caroline writing her first novel in Worcestershire while Laurence snoops through her papers in her London bedsit. Derek Stanford, meanwhile, in one of the uncanny coincidences that characterise her biography, was snooping through Spark’s own papers while she was writing The Comforters in Allington Castle. Removing a cache of manuscripts from the trunk in her London bedsit, he sold them to a dealer.Spark found her voice as a novelist in a novel about hearing voices, and tuning into “voices in the air” is how, from now on, she described her writing process. One of the reviewers was Evelyn Waugh. “It so happens,” he wrote in the Spectator, “that The Comforters came to me just as I had finished a story on a similar theme.”Waugh’s story, published six months later, was The Ordeal of Gilbert Pinfold, an account of his own breakdown that took place at the same time as Spark’s. In January 1954, plagued by rheumatic pains and insomnia, Waugh boarded the SS Staffordshire bound for Ceylon. After four days at sea he overheard voices discussing his “persecution mania” and insulting him; during meals, he spoke into the table lamp. Terrified, Waugh disembarked at Port Said but the voices followed him to his Cairo hotel. His letters home, he warned his wife, were being read back to him, word for word, “by the group of psychologists whom I met on the ship … the artful creatures can communicate from many hundreds of miles away”. Back in London the voices continued to repeat in his ear what he had just said. Waugh believed himself possessed, but his condition, his doctor confirmed, was the result of mixing bromide, chloral and crème de menthe.Two comic novels by two Catholic converts, both about hearing voices, both the result of breakdowns brought on by drug poisoning. The Comforters and Pinfold, like the wires between Laurence and Caroline, appeared to be products of an instantaneous messaging system between Waugh and Spark. How would Spark, still in a fragile state, have understood this coincidence? It was as if The Comforters had been dictated by Waugh, one of the voices in the air. And if Waugh was the typing ghost, then Spark was a character in her own book. But what if Waugh thought she had been snooping about in his study, reading his manuscripts?Thirty-five years later, in April 1991, Spark wrote to Waugh’s son Auberon: “I feel from something he wrote in his diary that your father’s first reaction on seeing my book was that someone had been prying into his papers. Can this be so?” Auberon, finding no such reference, replied: “I don’t think my father suffered a serious attack of persecution mania on first looking into The Comforters.” But in a letter to Ann Fleming in 1956, Auberon told Spark, Waugh mentioned The Comforters. “I am sure people will think it is by me. Please contradict such assertions.”Spark’s response to The Ordeal of Gilbert Pinfold can be found in her second novel, Robinson, where a clairvoyant advertises herself as “MURIEL THE MARVEL with her X-ray eyes.”Electric Spark: The Enigma of Muriel Spark by Frances Wilson is published by Bloomsbury.

In her new production of Rodelinda for Garsington Opera, the director Ruth Knight has to grapple, like those before her, with the need to balance the tone, taking the story and its unlikely curveballs seriously enough to make us care, and yet finding enough levity to entertain. By and large she succeeds – but even if not everything we see on stage convinces, what we hear certainly does. The cast, led byLucy Crowe’s powerhouse Rodelinda andTim Mead’s gloriously rich-toned Bertarido, is first-rate, the playing of theEnglish Concertthrillingly energised. Conducted by Peter Whelan, they support the singers yet never give the impression of holding back.Leslie Travers’ set brings the bones of theGarsington Operapavilion on to the stage, with the same steel beams and glass panels that are all around us creating two levels of playing area. At the top there are three groves of green trees, one for each of the royal siblings whose power plays, depicted in the busy overture, have led to the opera’s starting point; all have turned to ash by Act three. It mostly works well, but can feel cramped, with the tallest dancer’s head missing the girders by only inches.View image in fullscreenSwordplay … Ed Lyon as Grimoaldo, centre, in Rodelinda at Garsington Opera.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianThose dancers are the usurper Grimoaldo’s staff: a dozen or so creepy ninja-like attendants who move like snakes or birds. Sometimes they fight; more often they lurk, staring – a pack of velociraptors who are not quite hungry yet, but will be soon. Crowe’s Rodelinda takes several of them down in her first rage aria, whirling her sword likeUma Thurman as the Bride, but in gold silk trousers rather than a yellow boiler suit; later she’ll drink blood squeezed from a pig’s heart before popping out high notes like little explosions. What with those attendants and this heroine – not to mention the deliciously devilish villainy of Grimoaldo’s ambitious adviser Garibaldo, smoothly sung by the bass-baritone Brandon Cedel – the feeling of menace and high stakes is taken care of.As for the counterbalance, there are surprisingly generous touches of lightness, the best of which come courtesy of Ed Lyon’s Grimoaldo, a perfectly judged portrayal full of lightly worn swagger and increasing self-pity, or from the Unulfo of the impressive young countertenor Hugh Cutting, a kind of friend to all sides who slouches amiably around, ciggie in hand; at the end there’s a cute but superfluous suggestion that he’s a guardian angel who’s just earned his wings. Why Bertarido’s disguise should be quite so comically sparkly and camp is anyone’s guess, though, and it rather undermines the opera’s hero. Still, perhaps that is Knight’s point: often this opera can feel like it should be called Bertarido, but this time it’s definitely Rodelinda who is centre stage.AtGarsington Opera, Buckinghamshire, until 19 JulyExplore more on these topicsOperaClassical musicGarsington OperaGeorge Frideric HandelreviewsShareReuse this content"

Nearly 80 years since it wasestablished by Benjamin Britten and Peter Pears– and decades since their deaths – the couple still loom large in its Suffolk environs, their project continued by younger friends and collaborators.None are more eminent than the composerColin Matthews, whoassisted Brittenin the final years of his life. Now 79, Matthews has produced his own first opera, on a Chekhov-inspired libretto byWilliam Boyd: the world premiere of A Visit to Friends opened this year’s festival, on the same stage where Britten’s Death in Venice made its debut 52 years ago.A Visit to Friends features an opera within the opera: scenes of a work with a libretto by Chekhov and a score by an unknown composer that Matthews models onScriabinare interrupted by the “real world” of rehearsals. Life imitates art imitating life; it’s “a very complicated visit to friends”, as one character says. We hop between stages of the rehearsal process, while the internal opera’s plot pushes on.View image in fullscreenNaturalism … A Visit to Friends at Aldeburgh festival.Photograph: Richard Hubert SmithInLeanne Vandenbussche’s ingeniously simple set, the wall of a modern rehearsal room revolves to reveal the disintegrating veranda of a once-grand Russian house. Harsh lighting flicks up as run-throughs are halted. The rehearsal pianist slides on and off (upright and all). Colours play constantly across a video backdrop, as if taking the temperature of the action. Matthews’ score moves between the charged, late-Romantic meandering of the internal opera and something a little more incisive for the rehearsals. But much of the music is slow and delicately loose-limbed, its stagiest moment (a freeze-frame-like trio and quartet) in “real life”, not the fictional opera. Gesturally, though, the opera’s thespiness – hand-clasping, studied pointing, walking with an extravagant turning-circle – is a world away from the rehearsal’s naturalism.That the self-conscious cleverness of the framing device didn’t pall says much about both the quality of performance and the lucidity ofRachael Hewer’s production. The small cast was uniformly excellent:Marcus Farnsworthwas smoothly unpleasant as Misha/Marcus,Susanna Hurrella bright, brittle Nadia/Natalie andEdward Hawkinsa pitch-perfect parody of a certain brand of director.Lotte Betts-Dean’s Varia/Vanessa dominated, her mezzo so effusively rounded it was as if she kept finding the resonant frequency of the auditorium. Conducted byJessica Cottis,Aurora Orchestrarevelled in Matthews’ suavely luminous score.More Matthews followed the next morning: the world premiere by theGildas Quartetof his Quartet No 6, between the Three Idylls byBritten’s teacher Frank Bridgeand Beethoven’s String Quartet No 9 in C, Op 59 No 3. The eight movements of Matthews’ quartet were vividly characterised: there were impish cascades of pizzicato, melodic lines that wandered, unhurried, and a slow-motion elegy that lingered like the perfume of a loved one. Bridge’s Three Idylls showcased the Gildas’s fine-grained, mellow tone and total musical symbiosis. Their Beethoven was exquisitely stylish, from the cool, vibrato-free introduction to its final intoxicating rush. It was an utterly compelling performance: exhilarating playing that urged us to listen anew.The Aldeburgh festivalcontinues until 29 June.Explore more on these topicsClassical musicSnape MaltingsOperareviewsShareReuse this content"

But there is little chemistry in her relationship with Vronsky (Seamus Dillane) – the rakish military man for whom she leaves her loveless marriage, and he is a non-character, left uncoloured.Phillip Breen’s adaptation of the novel is however, always original, without playing fast and loose with the story. There is an inspired use of music, especially in the sound of a weeping or skittering violin. It is theatrically daring, with the ensemble sitting on regal seats when they are not performing, and a loose, handsome set, designed by Max Jones creates a sense of desolated opulence.‘A gift of a role for a mother’: Game of Thrones star Natalie Dormer on playing Tolstoy’s tortured Anna KareninaRead moreModern language is set against the period setting and dress. “Marriage, I’d rather stick pins in my eyes,” says longsuffering wife, Dolly (Naomi Sheldon), summing up the kernel of Tolstoy’s story in vernacular. The intention, it seems, is to bring these characters closer home to us.But the emotional life of the story seems rather too surface-bound. Scenarios and relationships are infused with a high wire kind of comedy which works to amuse, but it keeps the drama from gathering tragic depths. And there are too many directorial tics and flourishes which are clever but blithe.The set has the sense of a child’s nursery, with Dolly or Anna’s children playing with toys around its edges. It is one of Breen’s clever flourishes, relating to the weaponising of children within marriage – particular in the case of Karenin (Tomiwa Edun), Anna’s spurned husband, who enacts his vengeance through their son, from whom Anna becomes forcibly estranged.The production glows with the ambition of reflecting the full scope of the novel, from the era’s discoveries – electricity and trains – to social divides, to arguments around love v marriage, and the moral relativism of Russia’s gilded nobility. But it feels simultaneously brisk and too long, at three hours, in trying to cover so much.It strives to capture the psychological acuity of the novel too. Characters talk their feelings aloud so we hear what they feel and what they say. It is a heavy-handed way to animate their inner worlds: a “telling” over dramatising, with an uncertain note of comedy.View image in fullscreenHumour and tenderness … David Oakes as Levin and Shalisha James-Davis as Kitty in Anna Karenina.Photograph: Marc BrennerThere is a convincing fractiousness between unfaithful husband Stiva (Jonnie Broadbent, a mischievous wastrel), and Dolly; Sheldon gives a compelling performance of marital regret, her outcome an inverse parallel to Anna’s social shaming. Together the characters encompass the catch-22 for women marooned in bad marriages – they suffer whether they walk out or stay. But the modern language sits awkwardly when it is underlined in Dolly’s verbal meltdown, bringing a maelstrom of F-words in inner monologue.The relationship that sparks most on stage is that between Levin (based on Tolstoy himself, played by Dormer’s partner David Oakes) and Kitty (Shalisha James-Davis), from its humour to its tenderness.Anna’s outcome is foreshadowed from the start with a barrage of theatrical devices: music that mirrors the noise and speed of a train, a child’s wooden train set at the front of the stage, and characters performing locomotive sounds, including hoots that sound like screeches of pain. They lay out the ground for Anna’s terrible end across the train tracks. Except here, there is only a vague symbolic suggestion of it. Those who know the story will see the subtlety but those encountering it for the first time may be left with an approximate idea of what has happened.You do not feel its tragedy, perhaps as a result, nor the emptiness of Karenin’s vengeance on Anna, which leaves his son bereft of maternal love. Instead, you admire the production for its sometimes brilliant ideas.Anna Karenina is atChichester Festival theatre, until 28 JuneExplore more on these topicsTheatreChichester Festival theatreLeo TolstoyreviewsShareReuse this content"

For the gallery, it was a 17th-century jewel in its collection, the sort of work to which tourists would flock.But some immediately began to question the brushwork (too clumsy), describing it as a brash 20th-century copy of the original – and these doubts have only intensified. Katarzyna Krzyżagórska-Pisarek, a Rubens scholar, described the Samson and Delilah as “highly problematic” and “oddly modern”.And Christopher Wright, a leading specialist in 17th-century paintings, said the picture itself was simply “wrong”. He added: “It lacks Rubens’s subtlety. It has a beguiling, slush-and-splosh grandeur … All my instincts of knowing about old masters bring me to that observation. It’s not a 17th-century picture.”Feelings run deep in the art world over the question of the painting’s origins. Michael Daley, the director ofArtWatch UK, has researched the painting extensively and claims to have uncovered a mountain of evidence against the Rubens attribution. He calls it “the biggest of all museum scandals” and “a top-down conspiracy to conceal a massive purchasing blunder that debases Rubens’s oeuvre”.The latest twist in this enduring saga comes courtesy of remarks made – and then withdrawn – by Christopher Brown, a former curator of the National Gallery, who headed the Dutch and Flemish collections.Speaking to the Guardian, Brown insisted the painting was authentic, but intriguingly, he also said it was the National Gallery that had attached a modern blockboard to the painting’s back.This apparent admission has electrified the Rubens doubters once more.The backs of pictures often carry as much history as the front. With Samson, the panel on which the painting was originally painted has been planed down and attached to a modern blockboard, covering up whatever was underneath.Critics suspect that the original panel may have held crucial evidence relating to the date of the painting.The doubters also think the picture’s traditional cradled support was removed at the time.This would mean any clues to the Samson and Delilah’s origins and age – and therefore its authenticity – have disappeared. One piece of evidence on the panel might have been the makers’ monogram, the application of which was the done thing in 17th-century Antwerp. If a panel-maker’s mark had showed the panel to have been made later than around 1609, that would have shown that the painting was almost certainly a copy.When the gallery acquired the painting in 1980, there was no talk of a blockboard – it was bought as a panel.The gallery’s first public mention of the blockboard was in its 1983 technical bulletin report, with an earlier reference in its 1982 board minutes, when Brown was seeking permission to clean the painting.That was after the gallery had owned it for two years and its timber expert, Anthony Reeve, had described it as one of three unproblematic panels.The National Gallery said the painting’s back had been glued to a blockboard sheet “probably during the [20th] century”, adding in a 1990s exhibition catalogue: “The Samson and Delilah was planed down to a thickness of about 3mm and set into a new blockboard panel before it was acquired by the National Gallery in 1980 and so no trace of a panel maker’s mark can be found.”However, an eminent art historian’s condition report before the 1980 auction stated that the panel was “excellently preserved” and measured between 25mm and 40mm in thickness.And herein lies the mystery: who planed down the panel and glued it to modern blockboard, when did they do it and why? Several renowned experts have questioned the logic behind the decision, considering it had been described as being in good shape.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toArt WeeklyFree weekly newsletterYour weekly art world round-up, sketching out all the biggest stories, scandals and exhibitionsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

When the picture appeared at Christie’s, it looked immaculate. If the panel had been insecure, it would have been obvious.”When approached by the Guardian, Brown said itwasthe gallery that put on the blockboard – a brand-new admission from a former curator held in the utmost regard.Brown said: “The present backing was put on by the National Gallery … It’s rather a thin panel. It’s undoubtedly been thinned down at a certain stage and it was really to strengthen the panel.”However, after the Guardian approached the gallery for comment, Brown later changed his tune. He said: “The National Gallery says that the backboard was applied before its acquisition. I have no reason to disbelieve them, and am certainly not in a position to contradict them.”In his original interview, he had argued that “the idea that the National Gallery is in some way concealing something is nonsense” and that “the great scholars of Rubens have, since 1980, congratulated me”.Daley described Brown’s initial comments as “startling”, adding that he himself has “a 2002 correspondence with the gallery denying that this had been done by their restorers”.The painting had been previously attributed to lesser hands, and has no history as a Rubens before 1929, when it was found by Ludwig Burchard, a German historian who, after his death in 1960, was found to have misattributed paintings for commercial gain.Krzyżagórska-Pisarek has subsequently discovered that at least 75 works that Burchard attributed to Rubens have been officially demoted.She described the Samson and Delilah as “just the tip of the iceberg”, noting “the harsh, uniform red of Delilah’s dress” and Samson’s muscled back, which she said was “anatomically incorrect”, as well as a “curious lack of craquelure” – fine cracks that would be expected on a 400-year-old painting.She expressed frustration over the lack of debate, adding: “They don’t want a discussion because we’ve got arguments that are really impossible to answer. This cannot be the original Rubens.”Amid all the uncertainty, two things are for sure: the provenance of the painting will continue to send the art world into a spin, with scholars and aesthetes across the world continuing to call for that public debate.View image in fullscreenRubens experts say the National Gallery’s Samson and Delilah does not exhibit the painter’s subtlety.Photograph: Ian Dagnall/AlamyThe National Gallery said: “Samson and Delilah has long been accepted as a masterpiece by Peter Paul Rubens. Not one single Rubens specialist has doubted that the picture is by Rubens. Painted on wood panel in oil shortly after his return to Antwerp in 1608 and demonstrating all that the artist had learned in Italy, it is a work of the highest aesthetic quality.“A full discussion of the panel was published by Joyce Plesters and David Bomford in the Gallery’s Technical Bulletin in 1983, when Christopher Brown was the Gallery’s curator responsible for the picture. Their findings remain valid, including their unequivocal statement that the panel was attached to a support before the picture was acquired by the National Gallery.”Explore more on these topicsPaintingNational GalleryArtMuseumsnewsShareReuse this content"

For me, beat-em-ups were less about nurturing any masculine impulses toward strength and destruction, and more about the lore of the fighting game and its varied fighting styles, which played like a dance on the TV screen. That, and the ever-expanding rosters of sexy, glamorous femme fatales.There is a joke I have often heard that you know a young boy may be of the lavender persuasion if he only picks female characters in beat-em-up fighting video games – the parents might think it’s because he fancies them, but really it’s a form of diva worship. That was certainly true for me.View image in fullscreenElegance … Anna Williams in Tekken 7.Composite: Guardian Design;  Bandai NamcoAs a fan of the Japanese beat-em-up fighting series Tekken, I have had a lifelong fascination with two characters: Nina Williams and her sister, Anna. Nina debuted in the very first Tekken game in 1994. A complex, ice cold, blond bombshell assassin from Northern Ireland, Nina is distinct for her skin-tight purple outfits and knee-high boots, with a fighting style which blends aikido and koppojutsu. While the Tekken community believe her early designs appeared to be derived from Sharon Stone’s performance in Basic Instinct, later iterations of the character drew from a wider pool of femme fatales including Kill Bill’s Beatrix Kiddo (in Tekken 7, Nina wears a destroyed wedding gown).Why did Nina unlock a kind of queer longing in me? Certainly there’s the adoration of femininity that was consistent for me as a child with a precocious sense of my sexuality, but there was also something in the precision and elegance of her movements. Where other Tekken characters relied on brutish punches and head-butts, female characters such as Nina delighted me with their slaps, jabs and rhythmic, pirouetting gracefulness. As a young gay kid who was often teased and bullied for a preference to hop, skip, jump and prance around like a ballet dancer, I drew confidence from Nina’s own assuredness.View image in fullscreenSister act … Anna Williams in Tekken 8.Photograph: Bandai NamcoOver the course of the series, Nina Williams enjoyed an intense, campy rivalry with her younger, arguably more glamorous sister Anna, which entailed stolen dresses and heels, dramatic slaps, snatched bikini tops, and one murdered fiance.High camp, classic drama. But Anna clearly longs for love and acceptance from her sister despite Nina’s hostile, unfeeling disposition – something which I think spoke to me as a queer boy wanting the same in a world I felt didn’t want me.When Tekken 8 was released last year, Anna Williams was left off the roster, prompting backlash. When she was finally released in an update, redesigned with an asymmetrical bob with red highlights and a bazooka nicknamed “Lucky Tom”, there was much celebration particularly from queer fans. Mother is back!But Tekken isn’t especially sentient about its appeal to queer audiences (despite the inclusion of a genderless character, Leo Kliesen, in the sixth game). In avideo discussing Anna’s popularity, series game designer Michael Murray expressed surprise that “Anna is really popular among LGBTQ+ players”, while executive producer Katsuhiro Harada remarked that “Anna is particularly popular among lesbians”. Much of this is because of Anna’s personality in the series – histrionic, flirtatious and sensual. In an interaction with an older male character she says, “well hello you silver fox, looking for a good time?” I’m planning to steal that line to set up my next Grindr encounter."

And this summer, there’s one more festival accessory that partygoers won’t be travelling without: electrolyte tablets.Touted as a faster route to rehydration than water, and a way to replace vital salts lost during heavy drinking and partying, the focus on festivals is the latest twist in a global boom for electrolytes, as everyone from triathletes to YouTubers sings the praises of these super-hydrating mineral supplements.Happy Tuesdaysis selling “all-night electrolytes” for party people;Holy Hydrationsays its hydration powders are perfect for athletes and party people, replacing electrolytes and minerals lost from sweating; whileORS Hydrationclaims its tablets can help people to prevent or recover from hangovers. The UK health food chainHolland & Barrettis promoting electrolyte sachets and magnesium water as “festival essentials”.But can they really take the edge off a hangover, or soften the infamous “Tuesday blues” that follow a weekend flirtation with substances of a less legal kind?Electrolytes are minerals that are vital for basic bodily functions, such as regulating fluid levels, transmitting nerve impulses and ensuring the blood doesn’t become too acidic. The main electrolytes are sodium, potassium, chloride, magnesium, calcium, phosphate and bicarbonates.“They are carefully regulated within specific ranges in the body. This is because levels outside the normal ranges – either too high or too low – can lead to life-threatening complications,” said Dr Sammie Gill, a specialist gastroenterology dietitian and spokesperson for theBritish Dietetic Association.View image in fullscreenElectrolytes may be useful ‘during prolonged exercise and in hot climates’ … perfect for a day of dancing in the sun?Photograph: See Li/Picture Capital/AlamyFortunately, our bodies do an excellent job of maintaining the correct balance of these chemicals, with the kidneys playing a key role – so for healthy people, day to day, taking electrolyte supplements is unnecessary, Gill said. “There are so many foods that are rich in electrolytes, including plant-based foods and dairy. It’s not something people should be concerned about.”One scenario where a healthy person might need electrolytes is after a bout of vomiting or diarrhoea. This can cause significant fluid loss and upset the body’s balance of essential minerals like sodium and potassium, In severe cases, rehydrating with a properly balanced solution – such as oral rehydration salts –can be life-saving.Electrolytes may be useful in other situations – “for example, during periods of intense or prolonged exercise over an hour in duration, and especially in hot climates, or if the individual is a particular heavy sweater”, said Gill.And while partying in a sun-baked field isn’t quite the same as running a marathon, it could, in theory lead to dehydration – meaning electrolytes may be useful here as well. That said, Gill said if you truly need electrolyte support, it’s easy enough to make your own. “Simply mix 200ml of water, 300ml of fruit juice and a pinch of salt,” she said. “Cow’s milk is also a naturally a rich source of electrolytes, including sodium, potassium, calcium and magnesium. You’re also getting additional nutrients, such as protein, that electrolyte supplements do not deliver.”View image in fullscreenResearchers found that hydration had only a modest effect on hangover symptoms.Photograph: Alicia Canter/The GuardianWhether electrolyte sachets can ease hangovers or soften the crash after taking recreational drugs is another matter. A recentreview of UK hangover productsavailable on Amazon found that most contain modest amounts of potassium, sodium and vitamin C. But although dehydration is often blamed for the misery that follows a night of drinking, the science tells a more nuanced story.When researchers led by Joris Verster at Utrecht University reviewed the evidence last year, they found thatalthough alcohol does cause some fluid loss, dehydration and hangovers appear to be parallel outcomes of drinking, rather than one causing the other.In other words, although people often feel thirsty the morning after drinking, and may also feel terrible, thirst doesn’t reliably predict the intensity of a hangover – and drinking water during or after alcohol consumption has only a modest effect on symptoms.“Yes, thirst and dry mouth are common the next morning, and an electrolyte sachet might help with those symptoms, but it won’t touch the main symptoms like headache, nausea, fatigue, or hangxiety,” said Dr Blair Aitken at Swinburne University of Technology in Melbourne, who investigates the impact of recreational drugs on cognition. “Current research points to inflammation, oxidative stress, and acetaldehyde buildup as the key drivers of hangovers, not fluid or electrolyte loss.”Nor are they a cure for post-MDMA or ecstasy comedowns, Aitken said. These are thought to be driven by a temporary dip in serotonin, poor sleep, dehydration, and general physical and mental exhaustion. “You can’t simply restore a complex neurochemical system with a supplement and expect to feel normal again,” he said.Interestingly,a small 2022 study from Imperial College Londonfound no mood decline following MDMA-assisted therapy in clinical settings. “The authors suggested that the typical comedown might be more about context and expectation than the drug itself,” said Aitken.Some ingredients in rave recovery packs, may offer a small lift – hydration, sugar, perhaps some caffeine or other energy boosters, but they are not cures. “The best you can do to support recovery would be sleep, hydration, food and time,” said Aitken.That said, using electrolyte tablets after a night of dancing, sweating and consuming drugs or alcohol, is unlikely to be harmful, he added. “If people want to use them for a bit of post-party support, that’s fine – just don’t expect a miracle fix.”Explore more on these topicsHangover curesHealth & wellbeingMusic festivalsFestivalsAlcoholnewsShareReuse this content"

But are they really trying to console us when we’re distressed or do they just want their dinner?Sam PyrahSun 15 Jun 2025 04.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 15 Jun 2025 04.01 EDTShareIam lost in Morris’s eyes. They are brown, almond-shaped and fringed by impossibly long lashes. He looks back at me, softly blinking occasionally, and then reaches out his tongue and licks my cheek, just once.I’ve been depressed lately, and while I’ve received compassion and support from many dear people, Morris, my 10-year-old terrier, has been one of the greatest sources of comfort. With that reassuring lick, that steady gaze, he’s conveying a message: “It’s OK. Everything will be all right.”Or is he? Could the look actually be saying: “Those biscuits in the tin … Fancy getting me one?” Was he merely licking a fleck of mayonnaise off my cheek?Dr Jon Bowen, a behavioural consultant at the Queen Mother hospital for animals in Hertfordshire, waves my doubts away. “I’m sure your dog was showing empathy and support,” he says. “It’s part of why our mutual bonds with them are so powerful.” He also tells me that the close eye contact we sharedwould have released oxytocin,the bonding hormone – in both of us.A 2021study found that 80% of dog ownersfelt that their pet helped them get through tough times, and I’ve recently spoken to many people who felt the same. Sally Bayly, a yoga teacher from Rye in East Sussex, told me that when her husband, Michel, died in 2020, Lola, their black labrador, became extra attentive to her and her two sons. “It was as if she’d lost one of her pack and was determined not to lose any more,” she said. “Whenever one of us is feeling down, she’ll come over and lie near us, put her head close to us, or lick our hands, face, even clothes.” Lola accompanies Bayly to classes, where she plays an important role: “During relaxation, she walks around quietly, standing near people or sniffing them until they settle. She only lies down on her blanket when she feels everyone is totally relaxed. This helps me to know, too.”Margaret Walsh, a health and safety manager in the west of Ireland, told me how her cavachon helps her autistic son through difficult moments. “Conor rocks when he’s overstimulated, and as soon as Missy becomes aware of his distress she will jump on his lap, which helps them both relax.”View image in fullscreenEmotional support … Margaret Walsh’s son, Conor, and their cavachon.Photograph: Courtesy of Margaret WalshNot everyone in the scientific community is willing to recognise such behaviour as empathy, however.One recent study concluded: “It appears unlikely that dogs are capable of sympathy or empathy.”“There is a belief in some quarters that certain emotional and cognitive capacities, like being empathic, are a human preserve,” says Dr Karen Hiestand, a lecturer in veterinary and animal ethics at the Royal Veterinary College, Hertfordshire, whoseresearch centres on human-animal relationships. “Attributing such qualities to other species is considered anthropomorphism or ‘bad science’.”If our pets’ seemingly caring behaviour isn’t empathy, then what is it? One theory is that it could be driven by curiosity: why is my human not getting out of bed/making those strange sobbing sounds?Then there’s what’s known as “emotional contagion”, whereby witnessing an emotion in another “infects” the observer with the same emotion. (This is easily seen in young toddlers – one begins to cry and soon the room is full of crying infants.) Emotional contagion doesn’t require any understanding ofwhysomeone is feeling what they’re feeling, or motivate support. That would be what Hiestand calls “top-shelf empathy”, “where there’s a cognitive component – a thought process that says: I know how you feel, and I’m going to try to do something to help.”One of the ways this has been investigated in nonhuman animals is by replicating studies originally designed to test toddlers. The parent/owner feigns some kind of sudden distress and the infant/animal’s response is monitored – will they simply carry on with what they were doing? Will they get excited? Try to offer comfort?View image in fullscreenA cat person ‘till I die’ … Dr Karen Hiestand and Hermione.Photograph: Courtesy of Dr Karen HiestandOne such study soughtto distinguish between emotional contagion and higher empathy by bringing a stranger into the mix. When the owner cried, the majority of dogs showed empathic concern and comfort offering: they approached them slowly and gently – some nuzzled or put a paw on their owner, a couple made whimpering noises.But what about the stranger? If they were only experiencing emotional contagion, the dog would go to their owner for comfort when the stranger cried. If empathy was at work, however, then the dog would approach the crying stranger and seek to comfortthem. This is what happened: the dog noticed the stranger’s distress and went to them to offer comfort.Hiestand’s recent research adopted a similar experimental protocol – owners faked a sudden injury. But her study also included cats.A self-professed cat person (“till I die,” she says) Hiestand believes our feline friends are widely misunderstood – and unfairly compared with dogs.“While we share our lives and homes with both, they are completely different, evolutionarily speaking,” she says. “Dogs are highly social, group-living animals who have co-evolved with us for at least 40,000 years. Their ability to read us is huge. Domestic cats evolved from a completely solitary ancestor – the African wildcat – and have lived alongside us for far less time; any sociability they display is a domestication effect, not an inherent part of them.” By this token, a display of empathy from a cat in Hiestand’s experiment would be quite extraordinary.View image in fullscreenIs he just trying to lick mayonnaise off my cheek?Photograph: Sofia Conti/The GuardianSo what happened? Like dogs, the catsdidchange their behaviour in response to the feigned injury. “They stopped what they were doing. They looked at the owner more, though did not necessarily approach them. And they showed signs of stress, typically grooming a paw. Whether that’s empathy, or whether it’s ‘something weird is happening to this important resource in my world, so I’ll keep an eye on them’, it’s still significant.”Anne Hadley, a PhD student from Brighton, is convinced that her cat Harry is responsive to her emotional state. “When I am distressed, he seems to sense my need for comfort without me seeking him out, and he provides it in the only way he knows – snuggling up to me and purring,” she says. “He also loves being around me when I meditate, lying as close to me as possible.”Does Hiestand think her cat, Hermione, understands her? “I don’t know if she understands me, but recently she got beaten up by a neighbour’s cat and sustained some nasty injuries,” she says. “The normal thing for a cat that’s in pain or stressed is to go away and hide. But she came to me for comfort and support. When a cat behaves that way, it is motivated solely by their relationship with you, it’s not an innate response. She wanted to be close to me, and that made me feel amazing.”When I am distressed, he seems to sense my need for comfort without me seeking him outThis raises an important point. If believing that Morris is taking extra care of me helps me feel better, then his actions are of value, regardless of what motivates them. Hiestand agrees. “The participants in my study all reported increased bonds with the animals they believed were able to empathise with them, which provided great support.”Regardless of whether cats and dogs really care about our feelings, the fact that they can read our emotions so accurately in the first place is in itself remarkable.In a recentSeed Talkcalled The Psychology of Dogs, Bowen explains how dogs have learned that humans need to be looked at differently from dogs in order to read emotions. “In humans,” he says, “emotions are moreclearly readable on the left side of the face. When we try to read each other’s feelings, we tend to focus more – and for longer – at the left side of the face due to this asymmetry”. But dogs don’t have one side of the face more expressive than the other. “When they look at each other, they don’t focus on the left side of the face because there’s no need to. But when they look at us, they do,” says Bowen.View image in fullscreen‘She wanted to be close to me’ … HermionePhotograph: Courtesy of Dr Karen HiestandEye-tracking studies – which use technology to follow the focus of a subject’s gaze – show something similar. If it’s another dog they’re looking at, a dog’s first port of call will be the ears, then the mouth and eyes; but if it’s a human, they look first at the frontalis muscles (that wrinkle the forehead or raise the eyebrows), then the cheeks (which work hard when we smile) and eyes.Cats, too,recognise the emotions representedby different human expressions and tones of voice. They have also learned to use their voices as a way of communicating what they are feeling – miaowing is primarily directed at humans, not other cats.“Harry is the most vocal cat I have ever known,” says Hadley. “He leaves you in no doubt about his feelings. His miaows vary from chatty to purry, to a demanding no-nonsense miaow and a tragic wail.”As a woman and a cat owner, Hadley represents the cohort of people who fared the best in a2020 study by the University of Milan, which sought to test how adept people were at identifying the emotions associated with different cat miaows. Most people failed miserably.Given our long, shared history, you’d think we’d do better at reading dogs – but we’re pretty hopeless at that, too.Inresearch by Dr Holly Molinaro, from the Canine Science Collaboratory at Arizona State University, the majority of her 300 participants could not reliably gauge whether a dog in the video footage they were shown was happy or sad.The idea that animals feel guilty is incorrect – what you’re seeing is fear, they’re picking up that you’re angryMolinaro filmed a dog encountering a variety of situations: for example, being offered a treat, seeing a cat, or facing a man holding a leash or brandishing the vacuum cleaner. In the first instance, she only showed participants footage of the dog itself. Then she showed them the whole video. Given this new contextual information, they were much more forthcoming about whether the dog was happy or sad, calm or agitated. However, Molinaro noticed that they judged the dog’s emotions not on his behaviour but on the situation. “If he was in a positive scenario, they assumed he was happy; if it was negative, they assumed he was not happy,” she says.To test this out, Molinaro edited the video, swapping around the dog and background. For example, people were shown footage recorded when the dog was staring down the barrel of the vacuum cleaner, but in which he now appeared to be getting shown his leash. Despite having described him as feeling “bad and agitated” in the first instance, they now rated him “happy and calm”. “The results clearly showed that people judged the dog’s emotions not on his behaviour, but on the context,” Molinaro says.Even worse, when those who’d watched the doctored footage were asked what information they’d used to judge the dog’s emotions, they chose “context” the least, claiming to have observed the dog’s actions and demeanour. “We think we’re looking at the dog but we’re not.”Hiestand points out that even when wedolook at our pets’ expressions, we often misconstrue what we see.“The idea that animals feel guilty when they’ve done something ‘bad’ is widespread, but it’s incorrect,” she says. “When you get home and they’ve ripped up a cushion, what you’re seeing isn’t guilt – it’s fear. They are picking up that you are angry or upset.”Part of the problem is that we can’t help imagining howwewould feel in a given situation and projecting our own feelings on to them. “It’s so easy to do,” says Molinaro, admitting that despite her research, she still catches herself doing it with her cat.While our failure to read our pets’ feelings can, on occasions, be disastrous (Hiestand calls therecent rise in dog bitesan epidemic), the consequences are generally less serious: a dog having to endure a hug, whenresearch shows the vast majority don’t enjoy it; or as Hadley confesses, a longsuffering cat who, as a child, she would dress up in doll’s clothes – and “who never once scratched or protested”.But that doesn’t mean we shouldn’t try to do better.View image in fullscreenA way of talking with his eyes …Photograph: Sofia Conti/The Guardian“There’s an assumption that because we love our pets, their lives are good,” says Hiestand. “That is categorically not the case. We need to be mindful of ignoring their needs. We need to get to know them, not just as a dog or a cat but as an individual.”Bowen agrees. Over the last few years, he has used his considerable knowledge and skill to address an important question. What makes Wisley tick?Wisley is a black labrador who, says Bowen proudly, is the best dog in the world. (Well, that’s a coincidence, I say …)“He likes playing Frisbee. But what exactly about the game does he like? Is it the chase? Is it catching? Does he like chasing and catching other objects – or only a Frisbee? By observing him and pinpointing the moment he enjoys the most, I’ve learned what he likes and can fulfil it,” he says. “Knowing how to make your dog happy makes you happy.”I’d always liked to think I was pretty good at reading Morris. He has this way of talking with his eyes: I want a drink. I need to go outside. Can you two go to bed now? I’m tired.But writing this piece has given me paws (sorry) for thought. I’ve begun to notice that while he likes to come to me and sit very close when he senses I’m upset, he isn’t comfortable with me forcing such contact – say, picking him up and carrying him to where I’m going. And, no, he isn’t keen on being hugged. He‘ll tolerate it, but after a few moments he’ll get down and sidle off.In future, rather than basing my interactions with Morris around whatIwant, I’m going to make the effort to be more mindful of howheis feeling. After all, he is the best dog in the world.Explore more on these topicsPetsAnimalsDogsCatsAnimal behaviourPsychology (Guardian Masterclasses)Psychology (Science)featuresShareReuse this content"

It’s probably not a stretch to say that for many of us, wearing shorts is up there with getting into a swimsuit or showing your feet for the first time that year. A watershed moment of dread that, unlike most scary things – eating out alone, caring what other people think – only gets worse as you get older.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.But it’s also summer, and sometimes only shorts will do. Plus, this year, there really is something for every leg. Culottes are back, except they’re structured and called bermuda shorts – and you can even wear them to work. So are 1970s sports shorts, if your summer reference is more Ridgemont High. It’s not unseemly to wear boxer shorts, especially if you’re on the beach, just try them in seersucker – or if you prefer the freedom of a skirt, how about a skort? Hate all shorts? Try jean-shorts or “jorts” – they’re better than they sound. Here is a foolproof guide to getting over shorts fear.Can I wear shorts to the office?Apologies to those with a strict work dress code. For everyone else: yes, says Chioma Nnadi, head of editorial content at Vogue. “Several of the younger editors have been rocking jorts with tailored blazers, loafers and socks. It’s such a compelling look,” she says. “It’s a matter of getting the proportions right.”Look for tailored shorts that are structured and have pleats. Length-wise, this is up to you, but aim for something that sits on or above the knee. Avoid anything too tight (you’ll be in them for eight hours) or pure linen (it’ll crease). Your office dress code may differ from Vogue’s, so knee-length denim shorts may not pass muster. And if your job is sedentary, or you travel by public transport, try sitting down in them – think about skin-on-bus-seat contact.Formal shorts tend to be more structured for men, which makes things simpler. James Hawkes, head of menswear design at John Lewis, even makes a case for the long, dark denim short “with a single or double pleat”, which can be dressed up for semi-formal occasions “with a button-down shirt”.View image in fullscreenMen’s beige shorts£100 at AsketView image in fullscreenWomen’s brown pleat shorts£59.95 at Massimo DuttiView image in fullscreenWomen’s multi-stripe shorts£165 at Me+Em£165 at SelfridgesView image in fullscreenMen’s cream belted shorts£35.99 at ZaraView image in fullscreenWomen’s burgundy belted wrap-front shorts£85 at Cos£85 at H&MView image in fullscreenWomen’s red shorts£35.99 at MangoWhat does it mean for my shoes?View image in fullscreenShorts, from left: £135,cos.com; £98,reiss.com; £29.99,zara.com; £18.99,hm.com; £35.99,zara.com; £25.99,zara.com.Photograph: Dan Matthews/The GuardianBroadly speaking, when in the city, “a closed toe is a must”, says styling editor Melanie Wilkinson. Otherwise, think of shorts and shoes as you would a twinset – matchy matchy is good. For men and women, sporty shorts require sporty trainers (any colour, and I like a tennis sock), while semi-formal require a loafer or a boat shoe (men) – or a heel or low sandal (women; any higher than 3cm looks a bit off). If you’re on holiday, flip-flops or sliders are acceptable on the beach, but try a chunky sandal elsewhere (men: you can’t go wrong with a Birkenstock, while women:Veja’s new Etna styleis chic, fun and made from traceable materials).A few words on socks: to be encouraged. “Just make sure they are pulled up and worn with trainers, loafers and clog-style shoes only,” says Wilkinson. Otherwise, unless you’re on the beach or areHarrison Ford at Cannes, a bare ankle leaves you in danger of looking a bit Duran Duran.What are the best shorts to run in?Short ones. Long-distance runner Becky Briggs wears hers a meagre 7.5cm long for proper movement. In terms of shape, when she’s training, comfort is more important than you’d anticipate, as are multiple back pockets, she says, because chances are you’re out with earphones and keys. Race day is a different thing entirely. You need something tighter, she says, of thePuma shortsshe recently won the Hackney Half marathon in. They have to be “super light”, she says, “and you want to feel you’re not restricted in any way”, hence the 2.5cm slit up the side, which allows for movement.View image in fullscreenWomen’s Tempo run colour block shorts£65 at Sweaty Betty£65 at John LewisView image in fullscreenWomen’sTruePace recycled-shell shorts£80 at Stella McCartney£86 at Net-a-PorterView image in fullscreenWomen’sRaceday Ultraweave shorts£54.99 at SportsShoes£55 at PumaShould I tuck my top in?View image in fullscreenShorts, from left: £15,riverisland.com; £38,adanola.com; £70,uk.representclo.com; £20,asos.com.Photograph: Dan Matthews/The GuardianIt used to be simple: in or out. Neat and tidy, or an act of slobbish dissent. Nowadays for men, tucking is all about “vibes”, says Hawkes. A tucked top can “elevate your outfit for semi-formal occasions”, while untucked creates “a relaxed vibe”. The latter sounds obvious, but ensure the top length is right so the look is balanced.Something reasonably smart, a boxy T-shirt that ends 2.5cm below the waistband is a good compromise, as is a blazer/Harrington that sits5cm above the hem.For women, “oversized silhouettes can benefit from a tuck to add shape”, says Lisa Ferrie, head of women’s design at John Lewis. “And I would recommend you tuck in a vest to avoid strange bumps in the line of the outfit.” For something more casual, choose a top (probably a T-shirt) that sits just above the hemline, or is cropped. If you’re still on the fence, Ferrie “tucks in one side of a linen shirt, so it feels more effortless”.Can I wear shorts to a wedding?Off the bat, it would be prudent to check the dress code, or with the bride and groom first, even though dress codes have loosened up a bit. That said, for women, Uniqlo’s summer collection, designed almost entirely by Clare Waight Keller (who made Meghan Markle’s wedding dress), has a great spotty suit that “is giving Pretty Woman”, says Uniqlo’s Lottie Howard.This pair by Reisslooks like a skirt from the side, is linen-mix, and has little zips so you can open up the legs if you’re feeling brave. Try with a button-down shirt or blazer.“If you pick the right wash [darker],” adds Ferrie, “you can certainly wear them paired with a smart shirt and kitten heels.” Wilkinson is a fan, too, provided the rest of the outfit is above-average formal. She says: “I would wear them with a silk camisole top, a matching blazer and light-coloured heels, or a short suit.”Men: no.View image in fullscreenWomen’s botanical print shorts£135 at Mytheresa£160 at Farm RioView image in fullscreenWomen’s easy-silk shorts£125 at Rise & FallView image in fullscreenWomen’s side-zip tailored shorts£195 at Reiss£195 at NextHow much do I need to worry about my underwear?More than you’d hope. “Generally, living your life always moves your underwear around, but, in shorts, that feeling of bunched-up pants can be amplified,” says Wilkinson. She suggests seam-free underwear “if your shorts are close-fitting” and a fuller fit to avoid a VPL.Stripe & Staredoes a pretty ample brief, whileModibodiandM&Shave fuller cuts in sweat-wicking fabrics, which is handy if it’s warm – and, let’s face it, if you’re wearing shorts, it probably is.What about shorts on the beach?A must, says Wilkinson: “Crochet, denim cutoffs, a silky print, even a silky print suit with matching top, which is very White Lotus 1, 2 and 3.” The point is, she says, “have fun, embrace colour, embrace prints”.Nnadi thinks the beach is a good place to flex something a bit more elevated. “I’m not a particularly adventurous shorts-wearer. I tend to wear them on holiday mostly – a retro gym short with a gathered waist is my go-to, styled with a string vest, a camp shirt and a utility sandal,” says Nnadi, who has a few of Wales Bonner’s Adidas collaborations that she wears “on rotation”.Practically speaking, you’re going to be somewhere hot, in which case, go natural. Unless you’re going for something with a pleat (thencotton will be a base), linen (or linen mix) is light and breathable, althoughseersuckeris the 2025 way to wear the women’s boxers trend. In fact, for me, a pair of billowing boxers has usurped the beach dress.Linen or lightweight shorts tend to look better mid-thigh length.

But Ferrie likes to start with a simpler rule: “Go for those a little bit longer, to distinguish them from the styles you’d wear on holiday.”It’s also worth considering body proportions, says Hawkes. “Those with a slimmer build might prefer slightly shorter lengths, while those with a broader frame could opt for more length.” Ferrie agrees, adding that length also depends on the fabric. “Linen or lightweight options look better mid-thigh length, while jersey or sportier styles can be worn shorter,” she says.Personally, I just swap “short” for “skirt” and there’s the answer. Otherwise, there’s no practical difference between the two, except that one of them rides up. Otherwise, it’s a matter of preference. I like to test pairs out by sitting down (to gauge how much thigh you’ll see) and bending over in front of the mirror, and looking through my legs (sorry).… and for men?Hawkes thinks the safest length is above the knee, with an 18-22cm inseam, “which works for most people and situations”. The bermuda length, which is a 25-30cm inseam, is better for semi-formal settings. A “mid-thigh length, 12-17cm inseam”, is more contemporary (read: brave).View image in fullscreenMen’s green chino stretchbermuda shortsFrom £33 at Crew ClothingView image in fullscreenMen’s burgundy track shorts£160 at Adidas£160 at EndView image in fullscreenMen’s ecru embroidered shorts£89.25 at Jules B£105 at Wax LondonHow should I prepare my legs for the great unveiling?Beauty writerAnita Bhagwandashas a straightforward if labour-intensive process: “Start with a good scrub using anexfoliating mitt; a product that contains agentle acid-like glycolicwill give added exfoliation. Follow with aceramide-based moisturiserand add any finishing touches, such as a gradual tanning lotion orshimmering balm. Don’t forgetSPF.” And don’t forget your feet, either.Flexitolis my go-to for cracked heels.For more SPFs, check out our guide tothe best sunscreens for every needDo people still wear denim cutoffs?Yes. But change is afoot, says Tim Kaeding, co-founder of cult US denim brand Mother. “Last year, our bestselling shorts had 7-10cm inseams, but our current bestsellers have a 46.5cm inseam,” so you do the maths.The key to a good denim pair – long or short – is to only wear “variations of existing full-length fits”, says Kaeding, who suggests trimming existing shorts yourself, as you would a hem. “You already love how they sit on your waist, but cutting them off at the knee turns them into something new.”Can I wear sports shorts if I’m not doing sport?By all means. For men and women, the retro sports shorts – colourful ones with slightly curved hems, occasionally a stripe, but often pretty short – have made the leap from catwalk trend (Prada’s 28cm short) to high-street staple (Free People,AdidasandVarleyare best, butWhistlesandGanniusually have something in stock come summer).

They are not. Cycling shorts are basically underwear – yoga wear at a push. Personally, I prefer the “Princess Di leaving the gym” approach: they are shorts to be seen in when you don’t want to be seen.Cycling shorts, or compression shorts if you want a bit of holding in, are great under a shorter skirt or dress – they buy you a bit of coverage (think about the wind, if you’re sitting cross-legged, or if you’re out late and it gets chilly), or on their own under a bum-covering T-shirt or sweatshirt.Skims do a great stylethat sucks you in without any bulging.And they’re not just for women. Some brands, likeVuori, come withbuilt-incycling shorts. A male friend of mine wears them to help with thigh chafing when he runs. Wilkinson adds: “Frankly, I like a longer cycling short on men in summer, even if they’re not running, because it’s incredibly flattering. I wish they made them for women, too.”View image in fullscreenWomen’s black high-waisted shorts£25 at End£48 at SkimsView image in fullscreenMen’s green shorts with built-in cycling shorts£75 at VuoriView image in fullscreenWomen’s blue seamless scrunch shorts£40 at TalaHow can I avoid chafing?Bhagwandas suggests shorts under shorts –Runderwearhas some designed for sport – or an anti-friction stick.Megababe’sis a snip at £8, though if you don’t like the idea of cream,Lush does a powdermade (intriguingly) from clay.Is there advice for specific leg shapes?Bit of a minefield this, but a good rule of thumb is thinking about your preferred trouser style and working from there. Jorts, for example, are merely “a step-change from barrel jeans”, according to John Lewis. Think about whether you’re a high-waister or prefer low-slung. Or do you always wear loose clothing? In which case, boxer shorts (Tekla’s are comfy and fairly opaque) might be the thing.For men, try cutting existing trousers to see how they sit, says Kaeding. “Hacking off workwear trousers at the knee creates a novelty workwear utility short, which you don’t usually see.” For both men and women, they need to be big enough on the thighs – you want to avoid them riding up in the middle, so size up if you need to. Or go for a culotte orboxershape.I don’t like shorts. What do I wear instead?If you’re happy getting your legs out, a skort is a good start. Essentially, a short skirt with built-in shorts, skorts used to be a little bit naff – something I blame entirely on the name – but have since become both hip (Uniqlo predictsits skortswill be a big hit this summer, while Zara’sdenim skort suitis all over TikTok) and a lightning rod for feminism, after some camogie players in Ireland were banned for wearing skorts instead of skirts.View image in fullscreenWomen’s blue paisley print wrap skort£69 at Mint Velvet£69 at NextView image in fullscreenWomen’s butter yellow linen-blend skort£50 at Gap£50 at NextView image in fullscreenWomen’s wrap denim skort£25.99 at ZaraI don’t like getting my legs out. Can I still wear shorts?This spring, sales of the John Lewis women’slong denim shorts– AKA jorts – were up 300% week on week, something they put down to office casualisation, weather changes and people who don’t like shorts.Long, loose-ish and sitting on or below the knee, the trick is to treat them as a halfway house between shorts and jeans. Vogue’s Nnadi is a fan: “I like the idea of an oversized skater-style short or jort that’s to the knee, worn with a shrunken cardigan or a classic Chanel jacket and low-heeled slingbacks or ballet flats.”View image in fullscreenWomen’s pleated denim shorts£57 at Arket£57 at H&MView image in fullscreenWomen’s denim shorts£45 at John LewisView image in fullscreenUnisex black baggy denim shorts£44 at Weekday£44 at AsosView image in fullscreenMen’s carrier cargo shorts£55 at Levi’sView image in fullscreenMen’s Carhartt camo shorts£130 at Size?View image in fullscreenMen’s navy cargo shorts£88 at EndMorwenna Ferrier is the Guardian’s fashion and lifestyle editorExplore more on these topicsFashionThe FilterMen's fashionWomenWomen's shortsMen's shortsBeautyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

No, come back, please – don’t be scared. There are tables, chairs, napkins, reservations and all the other accoutrements of a bricks-and-mortar restaurant, even if this metal box may at some point in its existence once have been used to ship things to China and back. To my mind, Wapping Wharf has gone from strength to strength in recent years, and no longer feels at all like one of those novelty “box parks” that have about them a heavy whiff of the edgy temporary fixture. Today’s Wapping Wharf is a true independent food destination in its own right, and with a bird’s-eye view from one of Ragù’s window seats, while eating venison rump withgorgonzola dolceand sipping a booze-free vermouth, you can watch the crowds head for the likes of the modern FrenchLapin, Tokyo dinerSeven Lucky Gods, modern BritishBox-E,Gurt Wingsand many more; by day, there’s also a bakery, a butcher, a fromagerie and so on.Of course, anyone who calls their sophisticated modern Italian restaurant Ragù clearly didn’t live in the UK through the 1980s. For me, as for many others, ragu will always be sold in a glass jar and advertised viacaterwauling operatic dittiesduring the breaks onITV’s London’s Burning: “Ragu, it brings out the Italian in you,” etc. This was back in a time when Britain’s attitude to Italian cuisine stretched, broadly speaking, as far as spag bol, though many of us were at a loss to tackle the “bol” part of that equation without Unilever’s industrially squished sieved tomatoes at 79p a jar.View image in fullscreenRagù’s ‘crisp, lightly battered’ Roman artichoke fritti with aïoli.Those days are long gone, however, and the evidence is clear to see at Ragù, with its crisp, lightly battered artichoke fritters with a punchy aïoli, its Hereford onglet with cipollotti onion, and its cannoli with rhubarb curd and pistachio. Ragù caters to a young-ish, knowing audience who are well aware that Britain’s current Italian dining culture was shaped bythe River Cafe,Angela HartnettandGiorgio Locatelli. Owners Mark and Karen Chapman openedCoron North Street, Bedminster, in 2022, where they serve clever, fancy yet erring-on-the-hearty Mediterranean plates – think Catalan sausage with clams and fino butter sauce followed by tonka bean creme caramel. At Ragù, meanwhile, their focus is wholly Italian and, to my mind, this could be some of the most skilful cooking anywhere in Britain right now. I recommend the place wholly, effusively and slightly enviously of anyone who gets to taste the heavenly tiramisu made with sumptuously soggy slices of panettone before I get the chance to return.View image in fullscreen‘The greatest, richest, most drinkable tomato brodo I’ve ever tasted’: Ragù’s crespelle in tomato brodo.After the artichokefritti, we moved on to a bowl of humble-sounding “crespelle in tomato brodo, spinach and sheep’s ricotta”. That’s cheese pancakes in tomato sauce, right? Wrong. Very wrong. This was the greatest, richest, most drinkable-by-the-bucket tomato brodo I’ve ever tasted. Juicy, sweet, sharp and rich in all the right dimensions. What are they doing to tomatoes back there in that tiny kitchen?Next up, slow-cooked shoulder of lamb, pulled off the bone, shaped into a loose patty, placed on top of a fresh pea stew and dotted with a sharp salsa verde and earthy pecorino. The star of the show, however, was the Ashton Court venison, cooked rare but as soft as butter, then given plenty of colour in a hot pan and served on pungent gorgonzola with bone marrow butter. This is not a dish for the faint-hearted or slender of appetite. Those wanting something lighter might opt for the skate wing with salmoriglio and courgette and fennel salad, or even the tagliolini with Devon crab, but this is cooking that lends itself to excess.View image in fullscreenRagù’s chocolate budino with sour cherries and amaretti: ‘Almost too much.’Service was fantastically prompt throughout, as the young team coped with the Saturday night chaos with calm aplomb. Desserts are another highlight, with three types of Italian cheese (robiola la tur,ubriaco rossoand taleggio) and a gelato, which on that day was a pink grapefruit and Campari sorbet, but please leave room, if possible, for the chocolatebudinowith sour cherries – a thick, almost-too-much truffle-type cake with huge, boozy cherries and crumbed amaretti biscuits. It’s like an Italian take on theSt Emilion au chocolat, or perhaps the French stole it from the Italians in the first place? I’m not sure who makes it better, but it’s a fight I’d happily referee. Either way, Ragù might very well be my favourite new restaurant of 2025, and we’ve barely reached summer yet.

Food styling: Oliver Ainsworth.Felicity Cloake's masterclassBiscuitsHow to make chocolate chip cookies – recipeYour step-by-step guide to authentically gooey, chewy cookie heavenFelicity CloakeSun 15 Jun 2025 08.00 EDTShareOnce upon a time, not so long ago, the only so-called chocolate chip cookies on offer in the UK were, in fact, biscuits – small, brittle ones peppered with tiny, waxy, cocoa-coloured pellets. When I finally discovered the soft, chewy American originals in a subterranean outlet at Birmingham New Street station, my teenage mind was officially blown. These are even better.Prep25 min, plus chillingCook15 minMakes15120g room-temperature butter170g dark chocolate75g light brown sugar75g granulated sugar½ tsp vanilla extractA pinch of salt1 egg, beaten240g plain flour½ tsp bicarbonate of sodaSea salt flakes(optional)1 Make sure the butter is softView image in fullscreenMake sure your butter is soft enough to beat – if your kitchen is very cold, or you’ve forgotten to get it out of the fridge in time, dice it and leave it out on the counter while you gather together the rest of the ingredients. I tend to use salted butter for baking, as for everything else, but it’s up to you.2 Chop the chocolateView image in fullscreenRoughly chop the chocolate into small pieces; I like dark as a contrast to the sweet cookie dough, but you can use milk or white as you prefer, or a combination. (You could also swap some of it for chopped nuts, if you like, though this is not canonical.)Chocolatechips save you time, but don’t melt in the same way.3 Beat the butterPut the butter in a stand mixer, or in a bowl anchored to the counter with a damp tea towel, and beat with the paddle attachment, electric beaters or a wooden spoon until very soft and spreadable, scraping down the sides of the bowl as necessary.4 Now for the sugarsView image in fullscreenBeat in the sugars; this is my preferred combination, because the relatively high water content of soft brown sugar keeps the dough moist and gives it a caramel flavour, while granulated demerara dissolves less easily, resulting in a slight crunch, but feel free to experiment with other options. Dark brown sugar will yield treacly notes, caster a smoother texture.5 Add the beaten eggView image in fullscreenAdd the vanilla extract and a pinch of salt, then, with the mixer still running (or still working hard with your wooden spoon), gradually work in the beaten egg until you have a smooth, homogenous mixture, again scraping down the sides of the bowl as required.6 Fold in the flour and chocolateView image in fullscreenSift the flour and bicarbonate of soda on top (or whisk them in a bowl first), then fold into the butter and sugar mixture – once it’s thoroughly combined, try not to overwork the dough, because stirring develops the gluten, leading to tough cookies (not a good thing, in this instance). Fold in the chocolate pieces or other additions.7 Chill the doughCover and chill. I like to refrigerate the dough at least overnight (it’s good for up to 72 hours) to develop the flavour. Once chilled, divide the dough into golf ball-sized rounds and heat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6. (If you’re in a hurry and don’t have time to chill the dough, divide and shape, then pop into the freezer while the oven’s heating up.)View image in fullscreen8 Bake the cookiesLine two baking trays with greaseproof paper, then arrange the cookie dough balls spaced well apart on top. Bake for about 15 minutes, until golden but not browned – swap around the trays halfway through cooking, to ensure both sets of cookies bake evenly. Remove and leave the cookies on the trays to cool and firm up, then sprinkle them with a few salt flakes, if you like.9 And to make an extra batch …It’s worth making double the amount of dough, shaping into balls and freezing the excess, so you can have freshly baked chocolate chip cookies in about 20 minutes. To stop them sticking together, space the balls out on a tray and freeze solid, then tip into a bag for easier storage. Bake straight from frozen, adding a couple of minutes on to the baking time.Felicity Cloake’s new book, Peach Street to Lobster Lane: Coast to Coast in Search of Real American Cuisine, is published by Mudlark at £16.99.

It sounds great – it’s remote working and you could earn up to £800 a day. If you’re interested, you just need to contact the sender via the WhatsApp number provided.The job is pretty easy: you are asked to like and share content – usually onTikTok.“After you’ve starting liking and sharing content you receive a small payment, which is fraudulent funds from other people involved in the scam,” says Annya Burskys, the head of fraud operations at Nationwide building society. “Then you’re told that you need to pay a sum to unlock higher earnings – you may be told it’s for training.“Some of that money is used to pay other victims, and some goes into the hands of the organised crime gang.”Burskys says the original messages are proving an attractive proposition to people – particularly students.“We’re starting to see an uptick, particularly in the 16-25 age group,” she says. “Last year, we weren’t seeing these daily. Now it’s multiple cases a day, either of people who have sent money, or we’re receiving reports from other banks who have customers who have sent money to customers’ accounts.”In the latter cases, victims may have been persuaded to act as“money mules”– allowing their accounts to be used by the scammers to process payments.As well as handing over money, or accounts, victims may also find that the bank and identity details they are asked for are used for other scams.Burskys says typical losses have been in the hundreds or thousands of pounds. “It’s not the highest value – the problem is the volume,” she says. “It happens very quickly – from setup to speaking to realising you’re a scam victim is days, whereas your typical investment scam plays out over months or years.”As universities and schools break up, and students start looking for summer work, they need to beware the scammers.What the scam looks likeView image in fullscreenThe figure of £800 seems to appear a lot. The scam text will ask you to get in touch via a WhatsApp number.Photograph: The GuardianTexts claim to be from a recruitment agency – sometimes using the name of a legitimate company – or from TikTok and say there is work available. Some mention your CV, as if you have sent it in. The texts say you can earn hundreds of pounds a day (the figure £800 seems to appear a lot), and ask you to get in touch via a WhatsApp number.The phone calls are similar. In one this week an automated voice claimed to be from the recruitment agency Indeed and said a job was available and if the recipient was interested they should get in touch via WhatsApp. The phone number seemingly belonged to a regular UK mobile.View image in fullscreenSome of the scams mention your CV, as if you have sent it in. The texts say you can earn hundreds of pounds a day.Photograph: The GuardianWhat the messages ask forThe first message asks you to register your interest in a job. The scammers will then tell you the job involves liking and sharing content – probably TikTok videos. You might be asked for your details when you sign up, or when it comes time to receive some pay.You may receive a first “wage” but then you will be asked to pay for training, or similar, so you can unlock higher earnings.What to doBeware of any unsolicited message claiming to offer work. This is not a typical way for a legitimate agency to approach people. The agency Indeed says: “Indeed never contacts jobseekers directly by phone on behalf of employers using our platform to find and hire new employees.”Burskys says if you hear from a recruiter or company offering you a job you should “use Companies House, use LinkedIn to research them”. Companies House will show you if a company is operating, who its directors are and where it is based. You can check this against any details you have been given.If you recognise the name of the recruitment company, go to its website and see whether the job is advertised on there.In the UK, forward scam texts to 7726.Many recruiters have tips on how to carry out your job search safely, such as these fromIndeed.Explore more on these topicsConsumer affairsScam watchTikTokfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Tuscany gets a lot of love, but travel one region over to Umbria andMonti Sibillini national parkbewitches with views of the Apennines and eyrie-like, honey-coloured hill towns such as Castelluccio, soaring above a plateau of brightly coloured poppies, cornflowers and daisies. It’s a gorgeous spot for hiking, biking and tracking down a trattoria to dig into specialities such as wild boar with locally grown lentils. You’ll find some of Italy’s finest salami in butcher shops in Norcia, as well as black truffles on the menus of restaurants such as the Michelin-starredVespasia, which is in a 16th-century palazzo. Alternatively, you could join atartufaioand their dog to head into the woods on atruffle-hunting tour.How to do itOrganic farmAgriturismo Casale nel Parco dei Monti Sibillini(doubles from £84 B&B) has truffles and wild herbs in its grounds, and a terrific restaurant serving up local and homegrown produce.Mountain biking and Munros inScotlandView image in fullscreenThe Cairngorms.Photograph: Westend61/Getty ImagesIf you take rugged Highland scenery and turn the volume up, you get theCairngorms national park, a 1,748 square mile expanse of lochs, glens, forests and Munros. Providing the weather behaves, you’ll be itching to get outdoors, whether climbing 1,245-metre (4,085ft) Cairn Gorm or 1,309-metre Ben Macdui, spotting capercaillie, red squirrels and ospreys in the Caledonian pine forest ofRothiemurchus Estate, or meeting the region’sfree-roaming reindeeron a hill trip. There are wild swimming spots such as remote Loch Coire an Lochain, and visitors can go biking onCairngorm Mountain’s slopes. By night, there’s fantastic stargazing in theCairngorms Dark Sky Parkaround Tomintoul and Glenlivet.How to do itA train from London to Aviemore takes 7-8 hours. It’s free to wild camp in the park. Or stay at a self-catering forest cabin atCairngorm Lodges(two-nights from £264) on the park’s eastern fringes.Alpine lake swimming and high-level hikingin AustriaView image in fullscreenThiersee near Kufstein has crysal clear water for swimming and paddleboarding.Photograph: AlamyBetween the Brandenberg Alps and the limestone turrets of the Wilder Kaiser massif, Kufstein is a full-on Alpine fantasy, capped with a medievalfortress. The fact that it’s a living town, rather than a resort, means there’s a great buzz here in summer. And Kufstein’s backyard is beautiful. Within minutes, you can reach Wilder Kaiser’s hiking trails on asingle-seat chairliftfloating above treetops and meadows to the 1,256-metre peak of Brentenjoch. The landscape is dotted with lakes such as forest‑rimmed Hechtsee, mountain‑flanked Stimmersee and glass-green Thiersee, where you can dive into some of Austria’s cleanest waters or rent a paddleboard.How to do itKufstein is half an hour from Innsbruck or an hour from Munich by train.

But it’s a good one. Slamming into Italy, theSwiss national parkin Graubünden’s Engadin valley is an utterly wild Unesco biosphere reserve. Nature has been in charge here since the park’s formation in 1914, and as a result, it’s hiking heaven. The full-day, 13-mile trek from Zernez toLais da Macun(the Macun lakes) takes in a plateau beaded with 23 Alpine lakes. If you prefer company, sign up for guidedranger walks, including a wildlife-focused one in theVal Trupchunwhere, with luck and binoculars, you might spot marmots, ibex, chamois, deer and bearded vultures.How to do itWith good rail connections, Zernez is the gateway to the park and home to the visitor centre.Guided ranger hikes cost about £36. For an off-grid sleep, bookChamanna Cluozza(dorm beds £64). Deep in a forest, the hut is a 3½-hour hike from Zernez. Bring your sleeping bag.Cycling around Lake Constance– and through three countriesView image in fullscreenBregenz in Austria, on the shore of Lake Constance.Photograph: Image Professionals/AlamyFor uplifting views of the Alps by bike without the uphill slog, Lake Constance is unbeatable. Central Europe’s third largest lake, it delivers a massive shot of everything that makes Europe great – Roman ruins, medieval castles, gardens, gorges, wetlands, vineyards, orchards, thermal baths and beaches where you can strip off sweaty Lycra for a quick swim or a night spent camping under the stars. Looping around the lake and taking about a week to complete, the 170-mile (273km)Lake Constance Cycle Path, or Bodensee-Radweg as it’s known locally, is the biggie, rolling through three countries: Germany, Austria and Switzerland.How to do itAvoid the midsummer madness of July and August for fewer crowds. Bikes and ebikes can be rented in towns fringing the lake. Konstanz in Germany is a great springboard, with good rail connections.Turquoise lakes andEurope’s biggest ice cap in NorwayView image in fullscreenCamp by Lake Lovatnet in Norway and trek on a glacier.Photograph: Dibrova/Getty ImagesMother nature had a wild time inJostedalsbreen national parkin western Norway, delivering a visual feast of mountain-flanked fjords, ice-blue glacial lakes and – the clincher – the 37-mile-long Jostedalsbreen, mainland Europe’s biggest ice cap. Ways to explore are many and varied – there’s an easy four-mile round trek past waterfall-wisped peaks to Briksdalsbreen, an offshoot of the mighty glacier, or an opportunity to kayak, canoe and paddleboard across the turquoise waters of Lovatnet Lake, with rock walls punching above. For a close encounter with the ice, slip on a helmet and crampons to trek across the Haugabreen arm of the glacier.How to do itOn the dreamy shores of Lovatnet Lake,Sande Camping(pitches from £18) is a crazily pretty spot to pitch a tent. Breogfjell Mountain Guides runsix-hour guided glacier walks(£84) from mid-June to August.Swimming and kayaking in theJulian Alps in SloveniaView image in fullscreenLake Bohinj in Slovenia.Photograph: Getty ImagesIf you think Lake Bled is ridiculously lovely, wait until you clap eyes on Lake Bohinj, tucked away in the Julian Alps that tear acrossTriglav national parkin Slovenia’s north-west. Here, limestone turrets and pinnacles rise like natural fortifications above forests and glacial lakes that chart the spectrum of blues and greens. Loveliest of the lot is mirror-like Lake Bohinj, where you can dive into jewel-coloured waters that reach 22C in summer. The pebble beach in Ukanc, on the lake’s western shore, is as lovely a spot as any. Arrive early in the morning and you’ll have it all to yourself as you swim, canoe, kayak or paddleboard in glassy waters.How to do itPitch a tent on the shore at eco-friendlyCamp Bohinj(pitches from £25).

You can admire them from below, but you’ll get much closer on the 75-mile Alta Via 1, one of Italy’s most memorable hikes, reaching from Dobbiaco in the north to Belluno in the south. Negotiating steep, rocky inclines is rewarded with sublime views and stays at rustic huts likeRifugio LagazuoiandRifugio Cinque Torri, where you can dig into local specialities like polenta, venison andcanederli(bread dumplings with speck and cheese), peer up at star-blanketed night skies and get a crack‑of-dawn start on the trail.How to do itWhile the walk is certainly doable alone (book huts ahead for summer and get hold ofCicerone’s Alta Via 1 guide), logistically it’s easier to join a tour, such as the 10-night trip offered byAlpine Exploratory(from £2,880guided, £1,790self-guided).Castle-hopping in Germany’s Bavarian AlpsView image in fullscreenSchloss Neuschwanstein was the inspiration for Disney’s Sleeping Beauty castle.Photograph: Robert Wyatt/AlamyWhere the Bavarian Alps muscle their way into Austria, Füssen looks like something out of a children’s story. The old town’s alleys are stacked with gabled, frescoed houses and cafe-lined squares, and lofty castles bear the fantastical imprint of “Mad” King Ludwig II (1845-1886). Mad or not, he had an eye for a winning location, which you’ll appreciate when you visit the riotously turreted and recently revampedSchloss Neuschwanstein, which was the blueprint for Disney’s Sleeping Beauty castle, andmedieval Hohenschwangau, where little Ludwig grew up. There’s hiking, cycling and swimming at the lakes around Füssen, such as Forggensee, Hopfensee and Alpsee. All can be reached by bus for free with the local Füssen Card.How to do itFüssen is two hours from Munich by bus and train (bahn.de). Take your pick of hotels and B&Bs in the town, such asHotel Sonne(doubles from £130 B&B) in the historic centre, or camp by one of the lakes.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe TravellerFree newsletterGet travel inspiration, featured trips and local tips for your next break, as well as the latest deals from Guardian HolidaysEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Everyone raves about winter skiing in this chalet-lined village, but there’s lots happening in summer, when the steep slopes are given over to one of the world’s biggestbike parks– 400 miles (650km) of single tracks and heart-racing downhill trails. An extensive network of bike-friendly lifts links them up nicely. If you’re up for a bone-rattling challenge, tackle the Noire de Morzine from theLe Pléneycable car station. After you’ve stripped off sweaty Lycra and body armour, cool off with a swim in one of the crystal-clear lakes on Morzine’s doorstep, such as mountain‑clasped Lac de Montriond or forest-rimmed Mines d’Or. You can reach both within minutes on the free village buses.How to do itAlpy Transfersruns regular coaches between Geneva airport and Morzine (2 hours, one-way £17), prebooking is essential.Morzine’s Multi Passgets you access to lifts, lakes and lidos for £2.50 a day.

Here you can hike among jagged, lake-splashed peaks, ancient oak and beech forests, and deep, wildflower-flecked valleys where it’s silent enough to hear your own heartbeat – or perhaps the cry of a golden eagle. The untamed terrain here is best explored with a guide. For a deep dive,Much Better Adventuresarranges a challenging hut-to-hut trek, ticking off highs such as the glacial Lakes of Covadonga, the 2,319-metre summit of La Padiorna and the sheer-walled Cares Gorge.How to do itMuch Better Adventures’ six-night, small-group trek costs from £875 per person, including local guides, breakfast, dinner and stays in mountain huts and rural guesthouses.Waterfalls, springs and caves at Plitvice LakesinCroatiaView image in fullscreenPlitvice Lakes is a Unesco World Heritage site.Photograph: Sorin Colac/AlamyMost people who head to Croatia dash straight to the coast, but a step back from the Adriatic is the Unesco World Heritage sitePlitvice Lakes national park. Against the backdrop of the karstic Dinaric Alps, the park has mineral-rich springs, cascading falls, caves and lakes that glitter jade, aquamarine, ink-blue and turquoise. Brown bears, wild boar, lynx and wolves prowl the old-growth beech and fir forests, and clouds of blue-winged butterflies bring a fairytale touch in summer. For a true flavour of the park, bring binoculars and follow the 11-mile Route K, a full-day hike that knits together all 16 of the lakes.How to do itFrom Zagreb, buses andFlixBuscoaches run frequently to Plitvička Jezera in just over two hours. There are lots of traditional stone-and-wood villas where you can spend the night, includingVilla Verde(doubles from £93 B&B).A front-row view of the EigerinSwitzerlandView image in fullscreenThe Eiger Express cable car.Photograph: David Birri/JungfraubahnenSwitzerland’s outrageously beautiful Jungfrau region is the Alps on steroids, with its crashing waterfalls, gemstone lakes, cliff-hugging villages and the glacier-capped big three of the Eiger, Mönch and Jungfrau looming above it all. You could base yourself anywhere in these heights and reach the summits within minutes on vintage railways and state-of-the-art cable cars – but Grindelwald has the edge for outdoor adventure. As lively in summer as winter, the village has front-row views of the Eiger’s mile-high north face. TheEiger Expresscable car links up to Eigergletscher, the trailhead for the astoundingly scenic, two-hourEiger Trail. Or you can thunder towards the Eiger on ziplines, mountain carts and chunky scooters calledTrottibikesfrom theFirstcable car station above Grindelwald.How to do itGrindelwald is well connected by rail and can be reached in around nine hours from London via Paris, Strasbourg, Basel and Interlaken. Hotels are pricey, but you can save by camping at riversideGletscherdorf(pitches from £36).Practise yoga amongAustria’sAlpine peaksView image in fullscreenSt Anton am Arlberg has plenty to offer in summer too.Photograph: Cristian Mihaila/AlamySky-scraping peaks, scary slopes and après-ski parties draw folk to St Anton am Arlberg in Tyrol in winter. But when the snow melts, the village reveals its mellower side, with trails skipping through flower-freckled pastures to Alpine dairy huts likePutzen Alpe, where you can sample abrettljause(sharing board) of local ham and cheese, and watch the bell-swinging cows come home in the honeyed light of late afternoon. If you want to zone out even more from the rush of daily life, St Anton is right up there with the best places in the Alps for a spot of peak-gazing while doing yoga. Pick a meadow to practise your positions or sign up for classes and retreats atArlflow.How to do itSt Anton is an hour from Innsbruck by train. In early September, the four-dayMountain Yoga Festival, celebrating its 10th anniversary in 2025,brings some of the world’s best teachers and yogis to the heights, with outdoor sessions, sunrise meditation, Alpine pasture hikes, talks and workshops. Run by passionate mountain lovers,Piltriquitron(doubles from £113 B&B) is a stylish, welcoming lodge in the heart of St Anton.Wild swimming, wildlife and camping in WalesView image in fullscreenThe Mawddach estuary and the Cadair Idris range.Photograph: Tony Boydon/AlamyCome summer, conga lines of hikers trot up Wales’ highest peak, 1,085-metreYr Wyddfa(Snowdon). If you would prefer to give them the slip, head south toCefn Coed, a 17th-century, off-grid Welsh farm estate embedded in a wooded valley, where the slopes of Cadair Idris roll down to the shifting sands of theMawddach estuary. It’s all about embracing thewild side of Eryri (Snowdonia) here, whether you’re striking out on foot on the nine-mileMawddach Trail, which follows an old slate railway track, practising yoga in nature, going wildlife tracking or foraging for edibles you can transform into pickles, powders and pestos. Find your own wild swim spots along the river by day, and go on a starlit walk across the estate to look out for owls, badgers and, on mid-summer nights, glow-worms.How to do itCambrian Linetrains stop in Barmouth, four miles from Cefn Coed, where you cancamp in a clearing in oak woods(pitches £25-35), or for bigger groups there’sa 12-bed bunkhousein the farm’s original dairy and bakehouse (two-night stays from £350).Explore more on these topicsSummer holidaysEurope holidaysWalking holidaysWalkingCycling holidaysSwimming holidaysCamping holidaysfeaturesShareReuse this content"

This didn’t match the depiction of gayness I encountered in mainstream culture at the time, which was mostly very cheerful. Almost all of the gay men on my radar were comedians – figures such as Graham Norton and Alan Carr, both of whom I found funny and still admire today, but who were too easy-going and unpretentious to satisfy my desire to see myself as a tortured poet.When I got to university, I found the representation I was looking for – solemn and beautiful – in writers such asEdmund Whiteand James Baldwin, but earlier in my teenage years I had to make do with what was available: romanticising being gay through songs about straight men falling out with their platonic friends.View image in fullscreenWounded passion … Jesse Lacey of Brand New.Composite: Guardian Design;  Erika Goldring/GettyImagesIt’s a small but furtive canon, halfway between the diss track and the breakup ballad. Standouts include How Do You Sleep?, John Lennon’s spectacularly mean-spirited takedown of Paul McCartney; So Long, Frank Lloyd Wright, Paul Simon’s elegiac send-off to Art Garfunkel, who was pained to discover it was about him only years after its release; several songs arising from the falling-out between the Dandy Warhols and the Brian Jonestown Massacre, and No Regrets by Robbie Williams, a song about his decision to leave Take That – and specifically Gary Barlow, if you believe the speculation. While focused on the bitter aftermath, these songs portray love between men with a tragedy and grandeur typically only afforded to heterosexual romance.This is exactly what I wanted at the age of 14. The first buddy breakup song I ever loved was Seventy Times Seven by the emo band Brand New, which recounts a falling out between frontman Jesse Lacey and his former friend John Nolan (who later joined Taking Back Sunday and released a cutting riposte of his own). Musically it’s upbeat and effervescent, but the lyrics are venomous: it ends with Lacey urging Nolan: “Have another drink and drive yourself home / I hope there’s ice on all the roads / and you can think of me when you forget your seatbelt / and again when your head goes through the windscreen.” In hindsight, it’s a bit much.That Seventy Times Seven directed this degree of wounded passion towards another man was revelatory: it allowed me to cast the feelings I was beginning to have as not embarrassing or shameful but the stuff of Great Art, which was how I thought about three-minute-long pop punk songs at the time.Even after I grew out of emo, trading black hair dye for neon shutter shades, I still found myself returning to songs about straight men and their terrible conflict-resolution skills. The following year I developed an intense friendship with a slightly older boy who lived in the next town over and who was, to the best of my knowledge, entirely straight. It was the summer holidays and every night we’d stay up talking on MSN Messenger. There was nothing sexual about our relationship, but it was almost giddily romantic: we were always dreaming up plans to move to the big city together and shared the delusion that, by simple virtue of being ourselves, we were destined to become cultural icons of some description (we possessed no evident talent, so the details were left vague). Whenever we met up, there was one song we would always play, jumping around and pointing at each other as we sang the lyrics.View image in fullscreenCarl Barât (left) and Pete Doherty of the Libertines in Glasgow, 2004.Photograph: Andy Willsher/Redferns/GettyLike Seventy Times Seven, the Libertines’ Can’t Stand Me Now is inspired by a falling out between two best friends. It was released shortly after Pete Doherty was prosecuted for breaking into co-frontman Carl Barât’s flat and stealing a bunch of his stuff – but it is far more wistful. As per the lyrics, Barât and Doherty don’t just love each other, they are in love with each other, and the song is as much a reaffirmation of that love as a chronicle of its disintegration: to Doherty’s line “You can’t take me anywhere”, Barât replies “I’ll take you anywhere you wanna go”.I still find this moving as an expression of forgiveness and support to someone in the throes of addiction, even if the implied reconciliation turned out to be short-lived. The song isn’t at all homoerotic, but it is romantic, and I’m glad I got to scream it in the face of a boy who, if I wasn’t exactly in love with, I cared about deeply for a three-month spell before summer ended and our friendship petered out.When I was still in the closet, these songs and others like them allowed me to articulate emotions that had to be kept secret, and because they weren’t explicitly queer there was no chance of them blowing my cover: being into the Libertines didn’t invite suspicion, and if there was any stigma attached to being a Brand New fan it involved being an emo – a damaging enough charge in central Scotland – rather than being gay.As a grown man, I don’t have to look to queer representation in unlikely places. But I am grateful to the music that first allowed me to accept that men can experience deep, tender and painful feelings towards each other, and to think of my own desires as serious and worthy of respect."

Originally the name of apublic relations brainchildof former secretary of defense Donald Rumsfeld to combat what he saw asIraq war disinformation, thenew teamseems to have a similar mandate according to its X account: “Fighting Fake News!”So far, it has already garneredcriticismfor its excessive and partisan attacks on reporters and cheerleading of Hegseth, in what appears to be a media strategy bent on going on the offensive. The result is an apparent information warfare tool that flirts with fascistic takes and merges religion with a cult of personality surrounding Hegseth.Hegseth aide upended Pentagon leak inquiry with false wiretap claimsRead moreIn response to a blog post on the website of MSNBC figurehead, Rachel Maddow, criticizing Hegseth for carrying outwhat he calleda “Christian Prayer & Worship Service” inside the halls of the Pentagon, the rapid response team went into action.“Only the mainstream media would be upset that@SecDefloves THE LORD!” the rapid response team accountposted on X, with a screenshot of the article.As protests in Los Angeles escalated after continued Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) raids on migrants in the city this past week, rapid response came out with a full-throated backing of deploying American troops on American citizens, inside the US homeland – a move that is rarely taken lightly for any presidential administration.“Let’s be clear: Los Angeles is burning, and local leaders are refusing to respond,” posted its X account on Monday morning, assuring the national guard would be responding. “There is a ZERO tolerance for attacking federal agents who are doing their job.”The account followed upwith anotherpost, this time insulting the California governor, Gavin Newsom, showing an image of a protester waving a Mexican flag and burning in the foreground, with the caption: “Gavin Newscum’s California…”Other posts since the team’s creation, promote Hegseth’s interest in physical fitness or present him as the “warfighter” defense secretary, reminiscent of Italian fascist leader,Benito Mussolini, and current Russian presidentVladimir Putin, who has used his athletics to promote himself as a strongman.“Early morning PT with the@SecDef,”one X post readsfrom May showing Hegseth working out on a US ship with troops. “WE WILL BE FIT, NOT FAT!”The Pentagon downplayed to the Guardian that it was engaging in attacks on news media or political rivals.“Americans are turning to independent and digital media for their news because they no longer trust traditional and mainstream media to tell them the truth,” said Kingsley Wilson, Pentagon press secretary, in an emailed statement.“[Office of the Secretary of Defense for Public Affairs] is embracing digital media and independent outlets, taking our message of Peace through Strength directly to the American people.”Graham Allen, a former conservative podcaster andknown conspiracy theoristhas been leading the Pentagon’s overall digital media strategy. He was appointedshortly beforetheSignalgate leak, which embarrassed Hegseth and showed US officials sharing top secret information over an unsecured texting app.But in a Maypostannouncing he was stepping away from the role and remaining a consultant, Allen said he had accomplished his goal of making the “fake news” hate the “rapid response operation and basically everything else that’s led to the largest reaching digital accounts ever within the department, which means I did my job.”Hegseth overtly directing the Pentagon to promote his personal agenda has caught the eye of extremism watch dogs.Heidi Beirich, co-founder of theGlobal Project Against Hate and Extremismand an expert who has studied the confluence of the far right and the military for decades, has watched the secretary’s actions closely.“The rapid response team sure looks like Hegseth is missing Fox News and creating a pure propaganda arm for his policies,” she told the Guardian.“The constant attacks on legitimate news organizations and facts with screaming [X] posts about ‘fake news’ are proof that this is nothing more than Maga disinformation.”Beirich pointed out that Hegseth’s invocation of religion has become a particularly troubling development.“Hegseth is a committed Christian nationalist with a long track record of bigotry,” she said. “He is also a member of a church network run by Doug Wilson, a hard-right pastor who once wrote a biblical defense of slavery.”Hegseth’s predecessor, Lloyd Austin III, the silent type and an accomplished general in his own right, cuta quieter public personaand promoted diversity in the service. But Hegseth has done the opposite, instead announcing during Pride month the renaming of a vessel already bearing the name of a US naval veteran and gay rights pioneer.“Hegseth’s recent decision to change the name of a navy boat that had been christened for theLGBTQ+ rights pioneer Harvey Milk, shows you where he’s coming from,” Beirich said. “He and his Christian nationalist allies are anti-LGBTQ and specifically anti-trans and they are pushing their religious agenda on the services.”Explore more on these topicsPete HegsethTrump administrationUS politicsSocial mediaFar right (US)analysisShareReuse this content"

He has a point, not wholly answered by Rachel Reeves. It’s the vision thing, and the ability to communicate it. It’s about describing what Labour is for, in a general sense, beyond a list of policy deliverables. Growth is important, but only as a means, not an end. “Securonomics” is interesting, but has no public resonance.If people are now unsure whatLabourstands for, it is because the task of ideological self-definition has been neglected. This is unlike 1997, which was preceded by a process of rethinking that produced New Labour and the “third way”. Something similar is needed now. There is a rich tradition of social democratic thinking in Britain to draw on, including RH Tawney’s argument for equal access to what he called “the means of civilisation” as the basis for a common culture.Pragmatism is valuable, but it is not enough. An argument should be constructed around the three pillars of security, opportunity and community that would pull together all that the government is trying to do, and the kind of Britain it wants to create. And in a way that people might understand.Tony WrightLabour MP, 1992-2010I agree with Dhananjayan Sriskandarajah that the focus on investment alone will not work (Has Rachel Reeves made the right choices? Our panel responds to the spending review, 11 June). New public investments are pointless if the operation and maintenance of what already exists isn’t adequately funded.After years of austerity, the quickest and surest way to raise GDP and improve public services is to ensure that we realise the full potential of what we already have. The highest priority should be to relieve the financial pressure on those delivering services, especially our severely cash-strapped local authorities. This will deliver more broad-based and higher economic growth quickly, in contrast to the central allocation of investment funds to mega-projects that will take decades to deliver results.Entrepreneurs want to live and invest in safe areas with good health and education, well maintained roads and pleasant amenities. Properly funded local authorities can encourage higher private investment by delivering that. Unfortunately, they are instead expected to implement an expensive and disruptive reorganisation and find the money to pay higher minimum wages and national insurance while receiving a settlement that implies a real-terms cut in funding. Labour needs to think again.Michael FosterChelmsfordAccording to Rachel Reeves, the NHS has been “protected” and will receive “a 3% rise in its budget” (Spending review 2025: who are the winners and losers?, 11 June). But will it in practice? In a recent meeting with the chief executive of the Nottingham University hospitals trust, he told us that he had been instructed to make £97m of cuts in this financial year. This would mean leading to the loss of about 750 jobs and the closure of some wards.Further, these massive cuts are the trust’s contribution to the even bigger ones imposed on the integrated care board for our county: a £280m reduction in the provision for all local health services. So, which is it really, protection and a 3% rise, or enormous cuts?Mike ScottChair, Nottingham & Notts Keep Our NHS PublicHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

The rights of investors, it would seem, should prevail over the rights of communities to a clean environment.It is the failure of rigorously enforced regulation that led to the mismanagement ofThames Water, with loans being used to increase shareholder dividends and bloated bonuses for incompetent managers. In many countries the law can now be used to confiscate private assets gained from immoral activities, such as drug-running and prostitution. There is no reason why those who accrue wealth through the degradation of the natural environment should be treated any differently.Far from granting immunity from prosecution, the government should tighten the law to enable the criminal prosecution of the managers responsible and the repayment of shareholder dividends awarded by an underperforming business. Such a move would enable financial markets to promote good corporate governance and environmental sustainability. After all, financial investors and shareholders want profitable businesses that provide them with financial returns. If investors knew that they could lose their investment and dividends by investing in a company such as ThamesWater, they would soon look to invest in more ethically run businesses.The government should now initiate legal proceedings to seize the assets of those managers who enriched themselves by creating a debt-laden, high-polluting water company. The proceeds should be invested in water infrastructure and environmental clean-ups. And Thames Water should be taken into public ownership and its assets auctioned off.

But the Care Quality Commission (CQC) is not the only body to blame for failings like this.It can’t investigate individual complaints – this is mostly down to the local government and social care ombudsman (LGSCO), but also the parliamentary and health service ombudsman (PHSO). It depends on who funds the care; in theory the same care home could be dealing with two ombudsman staff unaware of each other. Both are equally damned on Trustpilot with overwhelmingly negative reviews.My dad died two days after he had been moved to a home for palliative care. So much went wrong on that awful day, with staff who didn’t care and with no involvement with any senior staff. I complained to the manager and then the company headquarters. I received many denials and excuses, one of which was so clearly untrue that I thought I’d caught them out.I told the PHSO everything. I waited for eight months, only to have every ridiculous excuse parroted back to me as a reason for not investigating. I don’t believe the LGSCO would have been any better.The care home company knew I had complained and had time to prepare for an investigation, which never came. All I did by complaining was show what it could get away with. Other homes in the same organisation have been graded as inadequate or requiring improvement, with poor staffing levels and attitudes to patients especially marked. So criticise the CQC, but don’t spare either ombudsman.Name and address suppliedYour article made me cry. My parents (90 and 92) have, since February, suffered deterioration in their health such that both now need full-time care. Three of the four local-authority-provided “rehab” places have so far been utterly woeful.The home that my father is currently living in is disastrous for a person in his position. My sister and I are desperately trying to sort an alternative for him, but it takes time and every day he is there is a day too long. And as for whistleblowing, we tried that when a carer was verbally abusive to my mother. The difficulties we are having moving her because of her record of “very difficult behaviour” are not unconnected.Name and address suppliedExplore more on these topicsCare Quality Commission (CQC)Older peopleHealthRegulatorslettersShareReuse this content"

However, having once lived in a much gull-colonised town, I’d like to advance an alternative view to Sophie Pavelle’s (Trying to get rid of noisy, food-stealing gulls is missing the point – it’s humans who are the pests, 8 June).Urban gulls excrete guano copiously. It covers cars, buildings and streets in a steady, noxious rain. As a corrosive substance it damages paintwork on buildings and paint on cars, guttering and ironwork, such as railings. As a fertiliser it boosts the growth of weeds on roofs and pavements, blocking drainage systems.Consequently, an enormous, expensive amount of repainting, woodwork replacement, guttering replacement, roofing repairs, pavement cleaning, car washing and car respraying must occur – all of these, in their way, ultimately creating substantial damage to the environment (paint, cleaning agents, building materials) at a high cost to local authorities.Some towns,such as Exmouth, avoid this by mounting campaigns to prevent gull-feeding. What also needs to occur is the restoration of habitats where gulls once lived – not a defence of their invasive and polluting presence in towns. Their webbed feet prove they are not naturally urban dwellers, after all.Richard EllisDerbyHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Currently, UK-China relations are showing a positive momentum.”“Exchanges and dialogues between the UK andChinaat all levels and in all fields will help enhance mutual understanding and trust between the two sides, and will also help promote the continuous development of bilateral relations and practical cooperation, which benefit the two peoples.”The development took place after a week in which several high-ranking Chinese officials visited the UK and held talks with senior government figures.He Lifeng, China’s vice-premier, and Wang Wentao, its commerce minister, were in London fortrade talks with the US last week. He metRachel Reeves, the UK chancellor, while Wang held talks with Jonathan Reynolds, the business and trade secretary.Liu Jianchao, one of China’s top diplomats who heads the international department of the Chinese Communist party, paid a three-day visit to the UK early last week where he met David Lammy, the foreign secretary, and Jonathan Powell, the national security adviser. None of these meetings were publicised by the UK government.Liu also participated in an event with British MPs hosted by the Great Britain China Centre, an arm’s-length government body, where China’s sanctions on UK parliamentarians were raised repeatedly. The visit faced criticism because Liu is an architect ofChina’s campaign of repressionagainst its citizens overseas.It is unknown whether China is considering lifting all the sanctions it imposed on UK citizens and organisations four years ago, or only some. Nine UK citizens were banned from China in 2021, including five Conservative MPs and two members of the House of Lords. They were targeted for highlighting human rights violations against the MuslimUyghurcommunity in the north-western province of Xinjiang.China’s sanctions were a retaliationagainst theUK imposing sanctions on Chinese officialsheld responsible for atrocities in Xinjiang. UK officials said there was no prospect of the government lifting those.The five MPs put under sanctions in 2021 were the former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith, Tom Tugendhat, Nusrat Ghani, Neil O’Brien and Tim Loughton, who stood down last summer. The two peers were David Alton, a crossbencher, and Helena Kennedy from Labour. Several are members of the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China.The Newcastle University academic Jo Smith Finley, whose research focuses on theUyghurs, and Geoffrey Nice KC, who chaired the Uyghur tribunal that investigated atrocities against the minority group, also had sanctions imposed upon them.Those under sanctions are banned from entering China, Hong Kong and Macau, any property they have in China has been frozen and Chinese citizens and institutions are prohibited from doing business with them.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The move was part of Beijing’s charm offensive to improve ties andrevive talks over a trade deal with Brussels, amid the turmoil caused by Donald Trump’s tariffs.There is no prospect of a UK-China trade deal. However, Beijing is awaiting a government decision over the fate of itsproposal to build a controversial super-embassynear the Tower of London. Ministers are due to approve or reject the plan this summer. The US government has reportedly raised concerns about the security implications.UK officials are drawing up plans for Reynolds tovisit Beijing to revive a key trade dialogue with Chinalater this year, and for Keir Starmer to make a bilateral trip to the country, potentially in the autumn.Labour took a much stronger stance towards human rights abuses in Xinjiang in opposition, when it pledged to take action to recognise them as genocide. It hassoftened its position in governmentand sought to build closer ties with China in pursuit of economic growth.During his visit to London last week, Liu also met Tony Blair, the former prime minister. Blair, who is expected to travel to China later this year, continues to informally advise senior figures in the UK and US on foreign policy matters.Explore more on these topicsForeign policyChinaUyghursHuman rightsAsia PacificLondonnewsShareReuse this content"

The second victim, who is 34 and also from Melbourne, was beaten, Badung police chief, Arif Batubara, said.“We cannot yet determine the motive,” Batubara said, adding that an investigation was under way.The two Australians were taken to hospitals in Denpasar.Dfat confirmed on Sunday morning it was helping the family of a dead man but would not confirm his name.“[The department] is providing consular assistance to the family of an Australian who died in a shooting incident inBali,” it said in a statement.“We send our deepest condolences to the family at this difficult time.“DFAT stands ready to provide consular assistance to another Australian injured in the same incident.“Owing to our privacy obligations we are unable to provide further comment.”According to police, the villa had only three rooms occupied with a total of five guests when the shooting happened. The two victims’ wives were also there and another foreign tourist, Batubara said.Radmanovic was shot in a bathroom, where police found 17 bullet casings and two intact bullets.At least three witnesses at the villa told investigators that two gunmen, one wearing an orange jacket with a dark helmet and another wearing a dark green jacket, a black mask and a dark helmet, arrived on a scooter at the villa around midnight.Radmanovic’s wife told police she woke up when she heard her husband screaming. She cowered under a blanket when she heard multiple gunshots.She later found her husband’s body and the injured Australian, whose wife has also testified to seeing the attackers.The Australian consulate in Bali has been contacted by authorities and an autopsy for further investigation was waiting permission from the family of the victim, Batubara said.Explore more on these topicsBaliIndonesiaAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

Those that were left were absorbed into the state department.Monday briefing: How Trump’s cuts to USAID are already harming the world’s worst offRead moreWorkers in Australian programs described“chaos” and “total panic”at the time, and warned programs could shut, causing “unnecessary deaths and suffering”.Some Australian aid projects had directUSAIDfunding, while others were jointly funded or subsidised through US funding.Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email“Australian NGOs and their partners have had to reduce operations and staff with dire consequences to local communities that are now no longer receiving essential healthcare, education, food or other assistance,” Acfid’s report, released on Monday, says.“At least 20 partner organisations and/or country offices of Australian NGOs have closed. Some local organisations have also had to close their doors permanently.”The report points out that it collected information during that 90-day period, that it was a time of “upheaval” and many organisations did not have a clear picture of the impacts.2:26What does it mean to be poor? The Australian government isn't sure – videoLess than half provided financial data, so the figures “should be read as a low estimate of impact on the Australian aid agencies and the local partners they work with around the world”, the report states.More than 120 projects were hit, with a financial value of more than $400m. The projects were mostly in the Pacific and south-east Asia.Projects to help children, combat climate change and provide humanitarian support were the hardest hit.In Nepal, 307 girls are no longer able to go to school after an education project closed. Without education, girls are at higher risk of child marriage and being trafficked, Acfid says.In Kiribati, almost 2,000 people lost access to improved water, sanitation and hygiene practices, leading to reduced access to clean water and increased risk of disease.The Acfid policy and advocacy chief, Jessica Mackenzie, said the development sector was only now fully grasping the scale of the fallout.“We’ve heard first-hand accounts from people on the ground ranging from communities in the Pacific losing access to clean water, to girls in Nepal deprived of education and fearful they may be forced into marriage,” she said.“At least $400m in humanitarian and development projects have been directly impacted by the USAID freeze for Australian NGOs.

So far they have found Washington’s messages to be contradictory.The French president, Emmanuel Macron; the German chancellor, Friedrich Merz; the Canadian prime minister, Mark Carney; and the UK prime minister, Keir Starmer, are trying to find a common line on Iran that goes beyond broad calls for de-escalation and restraint. Only Macron has attended a G7 summit before.On the way to the summit, which formally starts on Monday, Merz called for diplomacy to be given space but said Iran must not have nuclear weapons and urged it to stop bombing civilian targets in Israel.Starmer spoke with leaders of the United Arab Emirates, the Gulf state with closest ties to Israel. The UAE is doubtful that Israel’s attack will lead to the fall of the Iranian regime, but as its air and intelligence superiority grows more evident, Israel is more open that this is the moment for Iranians to end the regime.View image in fullscreenKeir Starmer and Mark Carney in Ottawa on Sunday.Photograph: Suzanne Plunkett/APFrance, Germany and the UK, previously closely involved in the talks on Iran’s nuclear programme, have been left in the cold by Trump, who insisted on seeking a bilateral deal with Iran.With so many pressing issues on the agenda, Europe will be cautious in deciding how much political capital to expend on pressing Trump into demanding a ceasefire.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He told Tehran not to widen its retaliation to include US facilities or interests.Speaking after a phone call with the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, he said: “We can easily get a deal done between Iran and Israel, and end this bloody conflict.”He gave no details, but the sticking point in the talks had been whether the US would permit Iran to retain a residual domestic uranium enrichment programme.Europe’s fear is that the conflict is quickly spiralling out of control, and that the Israeli government’s agenda is not just to expunge any traces of Iran’s nuclear sites but to attempt to trigger regime change in Tehran. Israel has denied this.Sir Richard Dearlove, the former head of MI6, said: “I think regime change is on the cards. I think the Israelis will take out the supreme leader if they can, as they took out [Hezbollah leader] Hassan Nasrallah in Beirut.”There will be growing pressure on Iran’s current leadership to conclude that only nuclear weapons can protect Iran, making it more likely that the west would support an attempt to engineer the fall of the theocratic regime.With its “axis of resistance”, or forward defence strategy,in disarraydue to assaults on Hamas and Hezbollah, and with Israel enjoying near impunity in the skies above Iran, Tehran is left dependent on its missile supply stock holding out and the security of its Fordow nuclear plant buried deep underground in the mountains north-east of Qom.Explore more on these topicsEuropeCanadaDonald TrumpEmmanuel MacronFriedrich MerzMark CarneyKeir StarmernewsShareReuse this content"

Of the 10 cases in which a suspect vessel was identified, eight were directly linked to China or Russia through flag-state registration or company ownership.Calls for Ireland to boost defence of subsea internet cablesRead moreThe involvement of “shadow fleet” commercial vessels in these incidents is consistent with China and Russia’s broader “grey zone” strategy – a space between war and peace – which aims to coerce adversaries while minimising opportunities for response, the report claims.The patterns of activity – such as the involvement of Chinese vessels in suspicious incidents in the Baltic Sea, and Russian vessels near Taiwan – suggest possible coordination between Moscow and Beijing on undersea cable attacks, it says.It is estimated that up to 99% of intercontinental data transmission takes place through submarine cable systems, playing a vital role in civilian and defence infrastructure. Without undersea cables, much of the economy – from international banking and cloud computing to virtual communications and global logistics – would cease to function.View image in fullscreenA TeleGeography map of undersea internet cables linking the US with the UK and Europe.Photograph: TeleGeographyThe UK acts as a key hub in Euro-Atlantic cable infrastructure and is likely to become a frequent target for future sabotage operations.But a UK government submission to parliament’s joint committee on the national security strategy has admitted that it has limited capabilities to monitor commercial maritime traffic around undersea cables. The joint committee is mounting an investigation into the threat posed to the underseas cables and the possibility of more secure alternatives.The Department for Science, Innovation and Technology submission to the committee noted that “the UK has limited capabilities for monitoring general maritime and white [commercial] shipping traffic, as coastal radar only covers about 22% of the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) around the UK.“The high volume of maritime traffic makes it challenging to identify every instance of abnormal maritime activity. As a result, the current capabilities cannot fully guarantee that all vessels adhere to UK laws and regulations, especially around sensitive infrastructure like undersea cables.”Andrew Yeh, the executive director of CSRI and author of the report, said: “Undersea cables underpin prosperity and security in the digital age. We cannot afford to be naive about the unprecedented threat that China and Russia’s grey-zone operations pose to the UK’s undersea infrastructure.“While well set up to deal with conventional threats, the UK’s defence infrastructure is woefully inadequate in protecting against grey-zone tactics. The UK must bolster its monitoring and surveillance capabilities, while looking to partners such as Taiwan who have a wealth of experience in countering grey-zone threats.”The recent strategic defence review admitted that underwater cables were becoming an increasingly vulnerable maritime domain.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The Danish government has said Greenland “is not for sale” and only Greenlanders can determine their future.Macron’s six-hour visit was “a signal in itself” and came at the request of both Denmark and Greenland, his office said. It began with talks with the Danish and Greenlandic prime ministers, Mette Frederiksen and Jens-Frederik Nielsen, on a Danish naval frigate.The French president was also due to visit a glacier to see the effects of global heating, and to discuss how to include Greenland in EU action to aid development while “respecting its sovereignty”. A planned visit to a hydroelectric plant was cancelled.Macron said before the visit that it was aimed at preventing further “preying” on the territory. In March, the US vice-president, JD Vance,visited the Pituffik US military baseon the island, criticising Denmark for not having “done a good job by the people of Greenland” and alleging Copenhagen had neglected the territory’s security.Pituffik, on the shortest route for missiles fired from Russia at the US, is essential to Washington’s missile defence system; while Greenland’s strategic importance has risen amid a race for rare earths and as melting ice opens up new shipping routes.The US defence secretary, Pete Hegseth,last week appeared to acknowledgethat the Pentagon had developed plans to take over Greenland by force if necessary but refused to answer repeated questions about the subject at a congressional hearing.The Wall Street Journal reported last month that agency officials under the US national intelligence director, Tulsi Gabbard, were looking into Greenland’s independence movement and sentiment about US resource extraction there.Frederiksen made several visits to Paris after Trump’s threats against Greenland, which unlike Denmark is not an EU member but has an association agreement with the bloc. Copenhagen has placed orders for French-made surface-to-air missiles.Florian Vidal of the Paris-based Ifri thinktank said that for Denmark, long one of Washington’s most loyal allies inEurope, enlisting the support of the EU’s only nuclear power was a way to project hard power towards a suddenly more predatory US.Vidal said: “The Trump administration’s more aggressive posture makes the French vision of Europe, one that is more autonomous, appear more reasonable for Denmark. From a Nordic point of view,Franceis a military power that counts.”Nielsen said in April that US statements about Greenland to date had been “disrespectful” and that the island would “never, ever be a piece of property that can be bought by just anyone”.He said last week that France’s support had been evident “since the first statements about taking our land emerged” and was both “necessary and gratifying”.Explore more on these topicsGreenlandEmmanuel MacronDonald TrumpDenmarkFranceEuropeEuropean UnionnewsShareReuse this content"

In the Italian port of Genoa, campaigners dragged a cardboard cruise ship through the old town’s narrow alleyways to show that tourism does not fit in the city.A procession later on Sunday in Lisbon was due to involve a replica of St Anthony being “evicted” from his church and carried to the site of a prospective luxury hotel, to stress that even saints suffer from touristification.In Barcelona, an estimated 600-800 demonstrators marched through the city centre chanting “Your holidays, my misery” and waving banners with slogans such as “Mass tourism kills the city” and “Their greed brings us ruin.”Some fired water pistols, set off coloured flares and put “Neighbourhood self-defence, tourist go home” stickers on shop windows and hotels. Barcelona, a city of 1.6 million, drew 26 million tourists last year.Threading through all the actions was a rallying cry for arethink of a tourism modelthat campaigners say has increasingly funnelled profits into the hands of a few, while leaving locals to pay the price through soaring house prices and rents, environmental degradation and the proliferation of precarious, low-paying jobs.The tensions around tourism burst into public view last year aftertens of thousands of people protestedin Spain’s most popular destinations. The bulk of Sunday’s protests took place in Spain, where tourist arrivals surged last year torecord levels. Cities in Italy and Portugal also took part.Despite the spate of fear-inducing headlines in some media, the aim was not to attack tourists, said Asier Basurto, a member of the “tourism degrowth” platform that organised a march in the Basque city of San Sebastián.“People who go on vacation to one place or another are not our enemies, nor are they the target of our actions,” he said. “Let me be clear: our enemies are those who speculate on housing, who exploit workers and those who are profiting handsomely from the touristification of our cities.”View image in fullscreenTourists take selfies in Barcelona where activists met for a conference on overtourism.Photograph: Bruna Casas/ReutersThe seeds for the joint day of action were sown in April after groups from Spain, Italy,Portugaland France gathered in Barcelona for a days-long conference under the umbrella of the Southern European Network Against Touristification.“When we started speaking to each other, it was amazing,” said María Cardona, of Canviem el Rumb, or Let’s Change Course, one of the groups behind Sunday’s march in Ibiza. “Despite the distance between us, we’re all grappling with a similar problem.”In Ibiza, the march’s slogan was “the right to a dignified life”, said Cardona. “What does that mean when it comes to life on the island? There’s the right to water – we’reunder restrictions, there’s a drought, they’ve cut off all the public fountains,” she added. “But villas, hotels and luxury homes continue to fill their pools as if there were no water restrictions.”There was also the soaring cost of living that hadleft many workersliving in vans, caravans or tents. “And another thing we’re seeing is that the traditional, historical names of places are being changed to English names that locals don’t know,” said Cardona. “It’s like the island’s DNA is being transformed.”In Venice, locals protested against the lack of regulations that has allowed the number of short-term rentals to surge and hotels to tighten their grip on the housing market. “We’ve been emphasising for a couple of years now that there are more tourist beds than registered residents,” said Remi Wacogne of Ocio, acivic observatory on housing.“Tourism is physically and practically taking over homes.”The steady shift had unleashed a wave of change in the city. “One of the main businesses that keeps opening up in Venice, in addition to bars and restaurants, is ATMs,” said Wacogne. “Which is also in a sense a metaphor of what is going on. So Venice is basically an ATM for a very restricted group of people, firms and investors who are allowed to make money just out of renting the place out to people.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionThe sentiment was echoed in Genoa, where residents organised a “noisy stroll” with their cardboard cruise ship to highlight the incongruence of tourism and local life. “We see tourism as a means to extract value from our cities and regions,” said one organiser, who asked not to be named. “We are not some sort of mine. This is a place where people live.”Underpinning the joint action was a semantic shift. Rather than overtourism, which suggests that the solution lies in rolling back the number of tourists, the focus was on touristification, highlighting how hotspots are increasingly becoming commodified to be consumed by visitors, said Manuel Martin, of theMovement for a Housing Referendum,one of the groups organising the Lisbon action.“So it’s a shift away from being a place that exists by and for the people that live and work there,” he added.This has chipped away at the culture and social fabric of cities, added Martin, pointing to the shops and bookshops in Lisbon, some of them more than a century old, that have closed their doors after being priced out by rising rents. “It sort of excavates meaning from a place and turns it into a Disneyfied version of what it really is.”After a handful of protesters bearing water gunssquirted waterat tourists last year in Barcelona, making headlines around the world, organisers in the city said they were encouraging people to bring water guns to Sunday’s march.“But this needs to be contextualised,” said Daniel Pardo Rivacoba, of the Neighbourhood Assembly for Tourism Degrowth. Last year’s incident was covered by tabloids and other media as though it was threatening or intimidating. “The most extreme ones spoke about violence and things like that,” he said. “But a water gun is not a gun. It’s a toy. It doesn’t hurt anyone.”Campaigners in the city have adopted the water pistol as a symbol of local resistance. “To us, it is clear that it doesn’t harm anyone,” Pardo Rivacoba said. “But if we’re talking about violence, let’s talk about the violence of touristification. Let’s talk about the violence that tourism is inflicting on the city in terms of evictions, of pushing out the population, of labour exploitation, in the overload and abuse of public services.“When it comes to tourism, there is violence taking place. But it’s not because of water guns.”Additional reporting by Jon HenleyExplore more on these topicsOvertourismSpainItalyPortugalEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

In December France’s highest courtupheld his convictionfor influence peddling and corruption, ordering him to wear an electronic ankle tag for 12 months.Sarkozy, who remains an important figure in French politics,had been found guilty by a lower court in 2021of trying to bribe a judge and peddling influence in exchange for confidential information about an investigation into his 2007 campaign finances.Sarkozy, whose electronic tag was removed this month, has taken the case to the European court of human rights for appeal. His lawyer, Patrice Spinosi, said he had taken note of the award’s revocation but stressed that the appeal was still pending.An eventual ECHR ruling againstFrancewould “imply reviewing the criminal conviction against [Sarkozy], as well as his exclusion from the order of the Legion of Honour”, Spinosi said on Sunday.Emmanuel Macron argued against the decision, but the rules of France’s top state award stipulate that any recipient definitively sentenced to a term in prison equal to or greater than a year will be excluded from the order.The French president, who is known to meet Sarkozy regularly, had argued that his predecessor had been elected to the country’s highest office and it was “very important that former presidents are respected”.The only previous former president to have had his Legion of Honour revoked was the Nazi collaborator Philippe Pétain, the head of France’s wartime Vichy regime, who was convicted in August 1945 of high treason and conspiring with the enemy.Others to have been stripped of the honour include the former Syrian president Bashar al-Assad, the seven-time Tour de France winner Lance Armstrong, who was found to have used performance-enhancing drugs, and the film producer Harvey Weinstein, convicted of sexual abuse against women.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I do a lot, and never get credit for anything, but that’s OK, the PEOPLE understand.”His envoys face a challenge that appears to be deepening by the day, however, with Israel andIranwidening their attacks, and the casualty tolls rising.Israel attacked Iran’s energy industry and defence ministry on Saturday night, leaving a fuel depot ablaze through the night outside Tehran. It followed with evacuation warnings to civilians living near arms factories and on Sunday launched a rare daytime raid on the capital.Iran fired at least 70 missiles towards Israel and several evaded air defences. They hit a refinery in the north,killed four people in a Palestinian-majority townnear the Sea of Galilee and brought down part of a high-rise apartment block in Bat Yam, south of Tel Aviv.View image in fullscreenIsraeli soldiers search for survivors amid the rubble of residential buildings destroyed by an Iranian missile strike in Bat Yam, central Israel.Photograph: Baz Ratner/APIt was the heaviest missile barrage the country has faced, and the damage was shocking to many Israelis. Despite enduring years of rockets from Gaza and Lebanon, and months of missiles fired from Yemen by the Houthis, none of those groups could deploy the scale or destructive power of the Iranian attacks.At least 14 people were killed, three were missing and hundreds injured by Sunday morning.Benjamin Netanyahuvisited the site of the Bat Yam strike on Sunday to see the damage and meet rescue workers. “Iran will pay a very heavy price for the premeditated murder of civilians, women and children,” the prime minister said.In Iran the toll is many times higher, with at least 224 fatalities since Israel began its attacks, according to Iran’s health ministry. Spokesperson Hossein Kermanpour said on social media that 1,277 people had also been hospitalised, claiming that more than 90% of the casualties were civilians.‘There’s a smell of death in the air’: chaos in Tehran as residents try to flee or find shelterRead moreA finance analyst in Tehran said: “This is a massacre. The blasts haven’t stopped. Children are crying and we fear many civilians have been killed. There’s a smell of death in the air. I can’t stop crying.”An Israeli strike on Sunday killed the intelligence chief of Iran’s Revolutionary Guards, Mohammad Kazemi, along with two other officers, the IRNA state media news agency reported.“Three intelligence generals, Mohammad Kazemi, Hassan Mohaghegh and Mohsen Bagheri, were assassinated and fell as martyrs,” the agency said, citing a Revolutionary Guards statement.Late on Sunday the Israeli military said that it was striking surface-to-surface missile sites in Iran, its latest move in three days of escalating conflict.IDF spokesperson Nadav Shoshani wrote on X: “We are operating against this threat in our skies and in Iranian skies.”As fuel depots outside Tehran blazed on Saturday, Trump presided over theUS’s biggest military parade in decades. He later said the arsenal on display could be deployed against Iran if it targeted American assets.The US president said in a social media post: “If we are attacked in any way shape or form by Iran, the full strength and might of the U.S. Armed Forces will come down on you at levels never seen before.”There is little question that Israel would like the US to join its campaign.Only American weapons have the capability to reach parts of the Iranian nuclear projectsuch as the Fordow uranium enrichment plant, which is buried deep under a mountain.But while Iran has called off talks with the US on the future of its nuclear programme, and accused Washington of being Israel’s “partner” in the offensive launched on Friday, it has held off attacking US bases, embassies or other targets.View image in fullscreenA man looks over the front pages of Iranian daily newspapers outside a kiosk in Tehran.Photograph: Abedin Taherkenareh/EPAWith most of its top military leaders assassinated,Israel claiming domination of Iranian airspacefrom western Iran to Tehran, and several key nuclear sites seriously damaged, the regime in Tehran faces an unprecedented threat to its stability and possibly even its survival.Netanyahu has made no secret of his desire for regime change and on Sunday told Fox News that it “could certainly be the result” of the Israeli campaign.Trump has been more wary, and his administration vetoed a recent Israeli plan to kill the country’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Israel briefed the White House on the “credible” plan for assassination, but it was rejected by Americans as a dangerous escalation.The US president reiterated on Sunday as he departed for the G7 summit that he hoped for a deal between Iran and Israel, but added that “sometimes you have to fight it out”. He refused to say if he had asked Israel to pause its strikes.Iran’s foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, signalled on Sunday that Iran was open to attempts to de-escalate. If Israeli strikes on Iran stopped, “our responses will also stop”, he said, perhaps in an appeal to Trump’s promotion of himself as the ultimate dealmaker, and his election pitch that he would end America’s decades of overseas wars.The US is already trying to promote an exchange of messages with Iran to “calm tensions” with Israel, although the effort falls short of formal mediation, the Haaretz newspaper reported quoting foreign sources.Trump has spoken about the war with Iran’s allyVladimir Putinand the emir of Qatar, Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, who has been in direct contact with the Iranian president, Masoud Pezeshkian, since Friday.A map showing Israeli strikes on IranFriedrich Merz, the German chancellor, called the leader of Oman, Sultan Haitham bin Tariq al-Said, who had been due to host US-Iran talks, a government spokesperson said. They discussed the importance of halting the conflict and stopping Iran getting nuclear weapons.For Israel, Saturday night was the bloodiest of the conflict, despite its success in knocking out much of Iran’s military hierarchy and parts of its missile systems over the previous day.An Israeli military official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that even advanced air defences could not stop every missile when Iran launched large barrages, as it did on Saturday night.“In these amounts, of hundreds of projectiles, sadly there will be hits,” the official said. “Even the greatest aerial defence system doesn’t get to 100%.”Iran deployed about 70 missiles overnight, and dozens of drones, although Israel has a higher success rate intercepting those slower-moving projectiles. Over two nights, Iran fired about 270 missiles at Israel and 22 of them evaded air defences.View image in fullscreenWomen look at a building damaged after a missile strike in Tamra, northern Israel.Photograph: Ammar Awad/ReutersOne of those appeared to target a refinery in the northern city of Haifa. In a statement to the Tel Aviv stock exchange, Bazan Group said there were no injuries at its plant but pipelines and transmission lines were damaged, forcing some facilities to shut down.Netanyahu said he ordered the pre-emptive operation because Iranian progress towards developing nuclear weapons posed a critical security threat.After taking out the top of the military hierarchy and vital nuclear scientists, as well as striking key parts of the nuclear programme, Israel appears to be widening its campaign.It hit energy facilities overnight including an oil depot near Tehran that blazed through the night and a refinery in Bushehr province on the Gulf, and has told people living near arms factories in Iran to evacuate their homes.An Israeli military official said in the coming days there would be more attacks on “dual use” facilities and strikes to prevent Iran expanding its stockpile of missiles, estimated to stand at about 2,000 before Friday.Additional reporting by Deepa ParentExplore more on these topicsIsraelIranBenjamin NetanyahuDonald TrumpVladimir PutinQatarMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

But Trump has been in frequent communications with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.When asked about Reuters report, Netanyahu, in an interview on Sunday with Fox News Channel’s Special Report With Bret Baier, said: “There’s so many false reports of conversations that never happened, and I’m not going to get into that.”“But I can tell you, I think that we do what we need to do, we’ll do what we need to do. And I think the United States knows what is good for the United States,” Netanyahu said.Trump has been holding out hope for a resumption of US-Iranian negotiations over Tehran’s nuclear program.

On Saturday evening, the pair held an informal meeting before watching the Stanley Cup ice hockey final on TV in an Ottawa bar. “That is what we’re concentrating on and encouraging in our discussions with international partners.”Asked what Starmer could do at the G7, he added: “Clearly, the Middle East will be a topic of discussion, and will be this afternoon in the bilateral with prime minister Carney, but we’ve been clear throughout that the only route to peace is through diplomacy and through de-escalation.”How the dismantling of Iran’s regional proxies paved way for Israel’s attackRead moreEarlier on Sunday, the Foreign Office warned Britons against travel to Israel or the occupied Palestinian territories, one of the UK government’s most severe warnings in recent memory.The updated guidance warned that insurance policies may be invalidated, describing the crisis as a “fast-moving situation” posing “significant risks”.It marks the biggest escalation of UK travel advice since October 2023, when the government urged citizens to avoid all but essential travel after the Hamas attacks of 7 October. Sunday’s blanket warning goes further still, reflecting the growing threat to foreign nationals as tensions between Israel andIranboil over into open confrontation.Speaking to reporters on Saturday, during the flight to Canada, Starmer refused to rule out defending Israel from Iranian strikes launched in response to Israel’s attack against Iran’s nuclear and military infrastructure, despite Tehran’s threat that such an action could lead toBritish bases in the region being targeted.Speaking earlier to Sky News, Rachel Reeves, the chancellor, said that while theUK had sentadditional RAF Typhoon jets and refuelling aircraft to the region, this was just a “precautionary” move.“It does not mean that we are at war,” she said. Reeves noted the UK has in the past helped intercept missiles heading towards Israel, and said similar defensive action could not be ruled out.“We have in the past supported Israel when there have been missiles coming in,” she said, adding that the government would act to protect British assets and potentially support its allies.Asked if the UK would back Israel if it seemingly wanted to go further than degrading Iran’s nuclear capabilities, with strikes intended to push for regime change in Tehran, the No 10 spokesperson said not.“We have always been clear Israel must abide by international law, but more broadly, as I say, we’ve always supported Israel’s right to self-defence and its right to protect its citizens,” he said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

That is what we’re concentrating on and encouraging in our discussions with international partners.”Israel’s ambassador to the UK, Tzipi Hotovely, said on Sunday that “Europe owes a huge thank you” for Israel’s strike on Iranian nuclear infrastructure.She called the operation an act of self-defence, insisting Iran had rejected diplomatic overtures. “Our region would have been a place that is not safe for anyone if Iran had accomplished their plan,” she told the BBC’s Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg.The Guardian view on Israel’s shock attack on Iran: confusing US signals add to the peril | EditorialRead moreOver the weekend, Iranian missiles struck civilian areas of Israel, including the coastal city of Bat Yam, killing at least 13 people. In retaliation, Israel launched strikes deep into Iranian territory, including sites linked to the Revolutionary Guard and the country’sSouth Pars gas field.Iran’s president, Masoud Pezeshkian, has threatened a “more decisive and severe” response if Israeli strikes continue. The nation’s foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, accused Israel of attempting to drag the war into the Persian Gulf, and warned the conflict could spread further if not contained.Araghchi also claimed Israel’s actions were designed to sabotage nuclear negotiations between Tehran and Washington, and alleged they could not have happened “without the US green light and support”.With oil prices rising and regional instability worsening, governments in the west are facing pressure to both contain the violence and protect critical energy routes.While in Ottawa on Sunday, Starmer spoke to the president of the United Arab Emirates, Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan.The UAE is a potentially significant player in any moves to calm down the conflict. In March, the emirate was the intermediary used to deliver a letter to Tehran from Trump suggesting negotiations over Iran’s nuclear programme.Explore more on these topicsKeir StarmerIsraelIranCanadaMiddle East and north AfricaMark CarneynewsShareReuse this content"

She said the shooting began as people were advancing to the site a few minutes after her arrival.The latest killings of Palestinians near the aid distributions managed by theGazaHumanitarian Foundation (GHF) took place as Tom Fletcher, the UN’s under-secretary general for humanitarian affairs and emergency relief coordinator, warned about the foundation’s operations.He said: “Hunger must never be met with bullets. Humanitarians must be allowed to do their work. Life-saving aid must reach people in need, in line with humanitarian principles.”“Without immediate and massively scaled-up access to the basic means survival, we risk a descent into famine, further chaos and the loss of more lives,” he said.There have been near-daily shootings near the sites since they opened last month. Witnesses say Israeli forces have fired repeatedly on the crowds and health officials say scores of people have been killed. The military has acknowledged firing warning shots at what it says were suspects approaching its forces.In the latest incident, Palestinians said Israeli forces opened fire at about dawn towards crowds of Palestinians heading to two aid sites in Rafah.The attacks in Gaza are taking place as concern mounts that the territory is being forgotten.Thirty-two-year-old Mahmoud Abu Haloub, who has been displaced six times during the war, told the Guardian that the situation in Gaza had worsened since the outbreak of hostilities with Iran last week.He said: “The number of aid trucks has decreased, and there is now greater danger for those who go to receive aid. The Israeli army has become more deadly than before, launching shells and bombs that kill many, without anyone talking about these massacres.”Mohammed Zuhair, from the Beit Lahiya area, said: “The world’s shift of attention toward what is happening with Iran is a disaster for the people of Gaza, especially amid the current famine.“The focus on the Palestinian cause has diminished, and the world has forgotten about us. Our issue has been pushed to the margins while we live through a suffocating crisis under Israeli aggression, blockade, and a lack of food and medicine.”Maryam Al-Shafie, a 65-year-old widow and mother of a family of 12, said: “Yesterday, my grandson went to the aid trucks but came back with nothing. It was his first time, and we won’t let him go again after the massacre took place, and many were killed.“Since the events between Iran and Israel began, it has been a catastrophe for us. The situation has become even more unbearable. We expected the pressure on Gaza to ease, but it only worsened. No one talks about it – all the news is about what’s happening in Iran.”Experts and aid workers say Israel’s blockade and military campaign have caused widespread hunger and raised the risk of famine.The shooting happened hundreds of metres away from the sites, which are operated by the GHF, a group that Israel and the US hope will replace the UN-run system of aid distribution.The UN has rejected the new system, saying it violates humanitarian principles.The aid system rolled out last month has been marred by chaos and violence, while the UN system has struggled to deliver food because of Israeli restrictions and a breakdown of law and order, despite Israel loosening a total blockade it imposed from early March to mid-May.The GHF said there had been no violence in or around the distribution points. It has warned people to stay on the designated routes and recently paused delivery to discuss safety measures with the military.Israel’s military campaign has killed more than 55,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza’s health ministry.Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warGazaIranPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricaIsraelnewsShareReuse this content"

Any military development in this region can affect the entire world.”He was referring to the strike on a facility operating at South Pars, located offshore near Iran’s southern Bushehr province. The field supplies about 70% of Iran’s domestic natural gas.The South Pars/North Dome mega-field is the largest known gas reserve in the world. Iran, which shares the field with Qatar, has been developing its side since the late 1990s.Iranian media reported on Saturday a “massive explosion” and fire after an Israeli drone targeted one of the South Pars facilities.Araghchi added that Iran blamed the US for allowing Israel to start the war with Iran, but at present its conflict was confined to Israel, and Iran would not expand it to neighbouring countries, or to US facilities.“Over the past two days, we have received messages from the US through various channels claiming that they were not and will not be involved in this attack,” he said. “However, we do not believe this claim, because we have evidence to the contrary.“If the US government really makes such a claim, it should clearly and publicly state its position. Sending a private message is not enough.”On Friday,Israel launched a large-scale attack on Iran, killing top military commanders and nuclear scientists, and striking military bases, nuclear sites and residential areas across the country.Iran has since unleashed a deadly barrage ofmissile strikes on Israel, leaving at least 10 Israelis dead overnight Sunday and dozens more wounded.“It is necessary for the US government to clearly condemn the attack on nuclear facilities,” Iran’s leading diplomat said. “Such an action must be condemned from the perspective of international law.”0:59Iran does not want to expand conflict but will defend itself, foreign minister says – videoAraghchi was explaining why talks due with the US in Oman on Sunday had been cancelled, as well as justifying the Iranian response to Israel’s attacks as legitimate self-defence.He also disclosed that Tehran had asked for an emergency board meeting of the UN nuclear inspectorate the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) on Monday at which Iran plans to raise the Israeli attack on its Natanz nuclear facility.He said Iran had not intended to target Israeli economic positions, but had been forced to do so on the second day in response to attacks on its oil installations.Iranian foreign ministry sources believe Israel has clearly set out that its plan is to secure political regime change in Tehran, and it would be up to other European powers to say whether they agree with such steps.In his Tehran briefing, Araghchi thanked countries that had condemned the Israeli attack but said “there are countries in Europe that claimed to be civilised and adhere to international law, but instead of condemning Israel, have condemned Iran”.He also said he had requested a meeting of the IAEA on Monday after Israel’s attack on the Natanz nuclear facility.Explore more on these topicsIranIsraelMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

There were parents coming back for their children’s graduation – we’re both students, it really hit hard.”Gujarati communitiesin the capitaland other cities including Leicesterhave been gatheringsince the crash to commemorate the more than 270 people who died in the crash in Ahmedabad, one of the worst air accidents in Indian history.‘They were my everything’: tributes paid as names of more British Air India crash victims emergeRead moreThere have been remarkable stories, such as the Bristol student whomissed the flight because she was held up in trafficand the miraculous taleof the sole survivor, Vishwash Kumar Ramesh. But the details of the lives lost –ambitions and hopesextinguished in an instant – all add to the sense of shock among British-Indians.“We needed somewhere to mourn,” said Mayur Shikotra, who organised the vigil alongsidePranav Bhanot.Bhanot said: “We’re only a small community, many people are only one or two degrees away from the tragedy,. There aren’t that many flights that come out of Gujarat directly, so it really could have been anyone. That makes it hit home.”Much has been made of the close-knit nature of the Gujarati community in the UK, a fact that has made the traumapersonal for many.Narendra Thakerar was among a group of old schoolfriends with Gujarati backgrounds who decided to come and remember those who lost their lives.“I’ve flown three times in the last six months with Air India,” he said. “It’s a tragedy that no one prepares for, it’s humbling and just a reminder about how fragile we are.”Bhanot said: “It’s really important that we find out what happened, we need the bodies repatriated and hopefully some compensation for loved ones – it’s never going to bring anyone back but it’d be a recognition of what happened and the loss of life.”‘They were inseparable’: family’s anguish at wait to bring Air India victims homeRead moreAs well as grief, there was a desire forBoeing, the manufacturer of the aircraft, to be held accountable if it was at fault.“My first thought is the Boeing 787,” said Thakerar, who is glad the fleet is being inspected by the Indian governmentafter the disaster.Another member of the group, Mahesh Patel, said: “The problem is when you’re dealing with old planes that have been sold and resold and used and used.”There are more than 1,100 787s in service, with most major international airlines using them and its safety record in service has been good.Tata Group bought Air India from the Indian government in 2022 and announced plans last year to revamp and upgrade its fleet.“None of us want this to happen again so there needs to be a thorough investigation,” Thakerar said.Explore more on these topicsAir India Ahmedabad plane crashBoeingIndiaPlane crashesAirline industrySouth and central AsiafeaturesShareReuse this content"

Investigators identified her by DNA testing.“She got married on 17 January this year and was awaiting visa clearance to travel to London and live with her husband,” her uncle Kishore Rajpurohit told the Independent.Her father travelled to see her off at the airport. “He waited till she boarded and had not even crossed Mehsana when we learnt of the crash.,” said her uncle.Abdhiben PatelPatel, a mother to an eight-year-old boy, was reluctant to travel due to fears of leaving her son behind for the first time, one of her colleagues told the Press Association.Patel, known as Abdhi, 40, had flown to India a fortnight before to take care of her elderly mother.“She didn’t want to go,” said Atif Karim, 45, Patel’s colleague and close friend at Zone Beauty Studio in Northampton. “She told me: ‘I just don’t like being away from him.’ It was her first time leaving him, and she was very nervous. She wasn’t excited. It was a sense of duty. Her mum was unwell, but you could tell it was weighing on her.”Originally from Gujarat, Patel moved to the UK in 2012 and joined the salon in 2016, where she had served as a manager for the last three years.“She was the most diligent, reliable worker I’ve ever had,” Karim said. “But more than that, she was our friend. She was bubbly, kind, always smiling – she had a way of putting people at ease and always took a genuine interest in their lives. She got on with everyone and left a real mark on the people she worked with and the customers she served.”After the crash, a fundraiser, with a target of £50,000, has been launched to support Patel’s husband and son, raising more than £4,000 in its first few days.Elcina Alpesh MakwanaMakwana, 42, is the first British national to die in the crash whose remains have been returned by authorities. Her family held a funeral on Sunday at Pensionpora cemetery in Vadodara, in Gujarat.Her uncle Joseph Patelia told the Telegraph that before the flight took off on Thursday she had called her father, Edwin Patelia, to reassure him that she had boarded safely and would call again once she had landed in London.“That call never came. She vanished just like that, leaving us in shock, in tears, unable to believe what we were hearing.“About 15 minutes after that call, her younger sister Anne saw the news of a plane crash. She ran to her father and said: ‘Please check if Elcina was on that flight.’ That’s when our nightmare began.”Makwana, who used to run a telecoms business with her husband, had visited India for dental treatment – because “it’s quite expensive in the UK” – and to spend time with her parents.Patelia added: “She’d been having frequent toothaches. She travelled alone, and her husband Alpesh and their two young children, an 11-year-old daughter and a seven-year-old son, arrived here just yesterday.”Patelia said Makwana was a “gentle soul” and was charitable, supporting poor children in India by funding their education.“She had struggled a lot in life, moving to London over 15 years ago, taking on part-time jobs to support her family there and her parents here in India. She had no brothers, so she took on every responsibility herself.“Her loss is devastating. She was the bond that held our entire family together.”Explore more on these topicsAir India Ahmedabad plane crashIndiaSouth and central AsianewsShareReuse this content"

Not-for-profit models lack one of the negatives of private ownership, dividends, which have contributed to the worsening finances of several water companies, most notablyThames Water.”The committee uncovered in recent weeks that Thames Water executiveshad been paid bonusesworth millions of pounds from a controversial £3bn loan, the purpose of which was to stabilise the company’s finances and save it from collapse.Ministers recently set up anindependent water commissionto produce a report on the future of England’s struggling water industry, which is globally unique in that it is fully privatised and run for profit. Companies have presided over sewage spills and financial mismanagement leading to environmental destruction, a waste of customer money, large bonuses for executives and the risk of companies collapsing and requiring a taxpayer bailout.The Efra committee report is aimed at guiding the commission after months of collecting evidence from experts in the sector.Recommendations from the report include allowing the regulator, Ofwat, to block inappropriate owners from buying water companies and veto the hiring of executives.The government recently passed new laws that allow it to ban bonuses for chief executives, but the report notes that the weak standards currently underpinning this means water bosses who had recently overseen sewage spills were allowed to be paid bonuses. The new law bans performance-related bonuses only, so water companies can get around this by labelling them as something else, for example as retention payments, the report adds.The chair of the Efra committee, the Lib Dem MP Alistair Carmichael, said: “Amidst growing public outrage at the poor performance of water companies, some companies have been paying out high dividends to shareholders and excessive bonuses to their senior executives.“Water companies’ complex and sometimes impenetrable financial structures, with their myriad subsidiaries, holding companies and parent organisations, seem to suggest that their purpose is less to provide a good service to their customers and more to allow them to juggle their finances and their increasingly unsustainable levels of debt.“This has got to stop now. Trust and accountability in the water sector are very low. It is not acceptable that it has fallen to commendable citizen scientists to expose issues with local water resources. Environmental protection and the delivery of a reliable and safe water must be the first priorities of water companies and regulators.”Explore more on these topicsWaterWater industryThames WaterEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

Officials say the aim now is to scale that up, combining forces across regional police, specialist exploitation teams and national units such as Operation Hydrant.The crackdown will also involve the child sexual exploitation taskforce and the tackling organised exploitation programme, working in partnership to strengthen local investigations and improve police handling of abuse cases.The move comes alongside the formal launch of a statutory public inquiry, with powers to compel witnesses and direct local investigations, after a rapid review by Louise Casey concluded a new probe was necessary.The inquiry will scrutinise how institutions – including local councils, police forces and elected officials – failed vulnerable girls across the UK, with a specific focus on mishandled or ignored complaints.It will be able to “compel local deep-dive investigations” into historical cases and demand answers where complaints of wrongdoing or cover-ups have been made, under powers granted by the 2005 Inquiries Act.Yvette Cooper, the home secretary, said survivors of the abuse had been ignored for too long and described the new inquiry as a means to get “truth and justice”.“Not enough people listened to them then. That was wrong and unforgivable. We are changing that now,” she said.The shift follows months of public and political pressure. Labour had previously resisted backing a national inquiry, arguing that years of investigations and reviews – including the independent inquiry into child sexual abuse led by Prof Alexis Jay – had already exposed serious failings.But Starmer appointed Lady Casey earlier this year to revisit the case for further action, and has now accepted all of her recommendations.The inquiry will be chaired by a single figure and report independently, with the power to compel testimony and access to institutional records.Speaking on Sunday, the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, defended the change in position.“The prime minister wanted to assure himself that everything possible was being done,” she told the BBC. “This is about justice – not grandstanding.”But the U-turn has not gone unnoticed. The Reform UK leader, Nigel Farage, has welcomed the move but accused the Labour government of dragging its feet. The Conservative leader, Kemi Badenoch, called on Starmer to apologise for what she described as “six wasted months”.The government had come under growing pressure to shift its stance after senior Conservatives, Farage, campaigners, some victims’ families – and even Elon Musk – said only a full statutory inquiry could deliver accountability.Dan Carden, a Labour backbencher from the party’s Blue Labour wing, was the first to publicly break ranks, urging Starmer to “use the full power of the state”.In January, Tory MPs tabled an amendment to force a vote on establishing such an inquiry – a move that was blocked when Labour joined most MPs in voting it down. At the time, Badenoch accused Labour of risking the perception of a “cover-up”.Pressed on that, Reeves said Labour had always taken the issue seriously. “The Conservatives could have done another national inquiry, but they didn’t. We’ve been focused onimplementing the recommendations of the Alexis Jay reviewand other reviews, because there’s recommendations that have just been sitting on the table.”When asked whether Labour ministers would apologise to campaigners previously dismissed as alarmist, Reeves sidestepped the question. “The most important thing here is the victims. Not people’s hurt feelings,” she said.Officials say the goal is not only to jail more offenders, but to challenge what ministers now describe as a longstanding culture of denial. It is also expected to “strengthen the commitment” to locally led inquiries, with the national chair empowered to oversee their direction.The NCA-led crackdown will run in parallel, targeting known offenders, re-examining cases closed prematurely, and supporting forces to improve how child sexual exploitation is investigated.Cooper added: “More than 800 grooming gang cases have already been identified by police after I asked them to look again at cases which had closed too early.“Now we are asking the National Crime Agency to lead a major nationwide operation to track down more perpetrators and bring them to justice.”Explore more on these topicsCrimePoliceChildrenUK child abuse inquirynewsShareReuse this content"

The United Kingdom is facing threats on an unprecedented scale, be it aggressors who send their spy ships to our waters or hackers whose sophisticated cyber-plots seek to disrupt our public services.”Metreweli, who was made a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George last year, said: “I am proud and honoured to be asked to lead my service. MI6 plays a vital role – with MI5 and GCHQ – in keeping the British people safe and promoting UK interests overseas. I look forward to continuing that work alongside the brave officers and agents of MI6 and our many international partners.”Unlike its sister UK spy agencies, MI6 has never had a female head since it was founded in 1909. MI5 has previously been led by Stella Rimington and Eliza Manningham-Buller, and the current head of GCHQ is Anne Keast-Butler, its first female leader.Metreweli’s appointment is a case of life imitating art. Film buffs will remember Judi Dench’s turn as James Bond’s boss, M, over 17 years of the franchise.By convention the head of MI6 is known internally as C, short for chief, and is the agency’s only officer who is named and publicly acknowledged, gradually adopting a more public profile with occasional speeches and social media postings.Moore’s tenure was due to come to an end shortly. He has served nearly five years in the role, which he took up in September 2020. Five years is the considered maximum term for British spy chiefs, who typically move into consultancy and the private sector.Unlike his successor, who has spent her career inside MI5 and MI6, Moore was a relatively high-profile appointment, having been a diplomat. He spent nearly four years as ambassador to Turkey, where he formed a strong relationship with the country’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Yes, he said, speaking carefully while wedged in the aisle of the cramped jet, there would bea full statutory inquiry into grooming gangs.This was, it should be remembered, not just one of the most toxic debates in British politics during 2025, but one where Starmer and his ministers had continually pushed back against demands for such an action.So why now? At first sight this might seem similar to the recentU-turn over eligibility for pensioners’ winter fuel allowance– a belated acknowledgment that the original decision had been mistaken, masked by words about circumstances changing.But in this instance things are arguably more nuanced, despite the notably furious reactions from Kemi Badenoch and the shadow home secretary, Chris Philp, who were swift to accuse the prime minister of delay without reason.It is worth remembering that the scandal and the official response to it is not a new issue, and that demands for a new inquiry coincided squarely with Elon Musk, the billionaire X owner, taking a sudden interest in the subject.By the time Musk started posting furiously and often misleadingly about the subject, leaning heavily into the ideas of the British far right anti-Islam agitator Tommy Robinson, ministers were still pondering how to implement the recommendations of an existing inquiry completed by Prof Alexis Jay in 2022.The government found itself buffeted by a suddenly brutal media and political landscape, punctuated by grim vignettes like Musk calling Jess Phillips, the safeguarding minister who has perhaps done more to combat violence against women than any other serving Westminster MP, a “rape genocide apologist”.TheConservativesand Reform UK then demanded a fuller national investigation into the phenomenon of the sexual abuse gangs that sprung up around the night-time economies of a series of towns, with many of the offenders being of Pakistani heritage.No 10’s initial instinct was to hunker down and argue that the best action was to act on Jay’s recommendations. But within a few weeks this began to shift andthe government announced thatthe crossbench peer and safeguarding expert Louise Casey would conduct a review of the grooming gang evidence based on smaller local inquiries, without the statutory abilities to compel witnesses to give evidence.Casey has now completed her review and, as Starmer set out on the plane, recommended a full national inquiry, which will be set up.So this is perhaps less a U-turn than the consequences of January’s earlier U-turn, and in truth given Casey had called for a national inquiry, it would have been extremely difficult for the government to push back against this.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionThis will not, however, completely quell the political anger over the subject. The formal Home Office announcement of the inquiry implicitly acknowledges this, also setting out plans for the National Crime Agency to work with local police forces to try to prosecute grooming gang cases that happened years ago.Some critics of Starmer, Philp among them, also remain angry that, as they claim, he described supporters of a new inquiry as “far right” when the PM hit out against Musk in January. This is an over-interpretation of Starmer’s actual comments,who went no furtherthan saying they were “amplifying” some far-right demands.But, as shown by thecourt verdict last weekin which seven men who groomed two vulnerable teenage girls in Rochdale from 2001 and 2006 were belatedly convicted, this is not an issue that is about to go away. The hope must be that, at the very least, the new inquiry helps replace some of the invective with facts.Explore more on these topicsKeir StarmerViolence against women and girlsRape and sexual assaultLabourReform UKConservativesanalysisShareReuse this content"

On Thursday, she said the government was “reviewing the criteria”, but ministers are yet to release details.This week, the Guardian revealed that ministers were to offer mutinous Labour MPs an olive branch to help avert amajor rebellion over the plans.Under the Pip plans, which will introduce a “four-point rule”, claimants would not qualify unless they score a minimum of four points on a single daily living activity. Assessments score the difficulty from 0 to 12 that people face in a range of living activities such as preparing and eating food, communicating, washing and getting dressed.TheDepartment for Work and Pensions (DWP) estimates the cuts couldpush 250,000 people into relative povertyafter housing costs by 2029-30, including 50,000 children.The Guardian spoke to four households after scores of people responded to an online callout asking how people could be affected.‘I really didn’t think Labour would be so heartless’There are some things that Neil needs extra support with: cooking meals, washing clothes, changing bedsheets, cleaning his bungalow. The 50-year-old in Gateshead was working in banking in 2019 when he suffered a bleed to the brain related to a stroke he had aged four.Six years later, Neil says he still suffers with frequent falls, severe headaches and losing use of his dominant hand, so he relies on care, which he can afford due to the personal independence payment (Pip). But under Labour’s “four-point rule”, Neil would lose everything.“There is no chance of me being able to afford [that care],” he says.Neil gets £187.45 a week from Pip, but does not score four in any daily living category. He is angry and worried at the risk of debt, facing dilemmas of “heat or eat”, and being unable to even go out for a coffee. “We’ve all got to have some enjoyment in life, otherwise what’s the point.”After voting Labour last summer, Neil says he has lost faith in the party. “I really didn’t think Labour would be so heartless. I had to close my membership, I just couldn’t support them any more.“From a personal point of view, I feel like a scrounger, that’s how the Labour party has made me feel. And it’s not fair, we’re just trying to live life as best we can.”‘I get that cost savings are needed but there are better ways of doing it’The government says its welfare changes are needed toencourage peoplewith disabilities to work. But Jo, a 46-year-old in Cumbria who suffers from pain, fatigue and cognitive and balance issues related to spina bifida from birth, says the proposals will have the exact opposite effect and push disabled people out of the workplace.“It disgusts me really, because when this first came out, the rhetoric was [framing Pip] as an out-of-work benefit. It’s not!” Jo says. “It keeps a lot of peopleableto work.” She says Pip allows her to continue working part-time for a local charity. But losing it, because she does not pass the “four-point rule”, would force her to quit the job.“Pip is a lifeline to a lot of people, and I don’t say that lightly. They really need to think about the actual impact it’s going to have,” says Jo, who is a single mother with a 17-year-old daughter. She urged the government to delay a vote until after the government’sconsultation, which ends on 30 June. “I get that cost savings are probably needed but there are better ways of doing it.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He gets £103.10 a week from Pip and his wife, Ginny, 49 – with whom he has two school-age daughters – is his part-time carer, meaning she gets carer’s allowance.But Tim would fail the four-point rule. That would also mean that Ginny, because the person she cares for would no longer be eligible for Pip, wouldlose her£210.68 a month carer’s allowance.Tim has worked as a film-maker and more recently a casual library assistant, but for the last four years it has been difficult to find work because of his mobility and communication issues. He also experiences regular falls.It feels “as if disabled people are lower down the pecking order in their importance to society, it seems like their only value lies in whether they can work or not”, says Ginny. Tim says the government should tax the super-rich to raise revenue rather than cut welfare spending for vulnerable people.‘This is a party allegedly founded on welfare principles’In the voting booth last summer, Richard, a 62-year-old in Welwyn Garden City, voted Labour for the first time. But in light of the party’s planned welfare changes, he says: “Never again.”“I will not forget this,” says Richard, who has rheumatoid arthritis. He adds that many people he has spoken to locally seem to be abandoning Labour over its welfare policies and weighing up voting for Reform UK, which has been trying toportray itselfas more pro-welfare.Richard was awarded £101.35 a week last year, but would fail the four-point rule and lose Pip, which he spends on support for cleaning, transport, help with bathing and other care.He believes fluctuating conditions are not treated adequately by the DWP. “I could push a hoover around today,” he says, whereas some weeks he cannot move to the front door without constant discomfort.“This is a party allegedly founded on welfare principles,” he says, adding: “Come on Labour MPs: find some moral backbone, and find ways to support vulnerable people.”Explore more on these topicsWelfareBenefitsDisabilityfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Ah Loo, who had been taken to the hospital on Saturday evening, where he died from his wounds.Redd said a man in a brightly colored vest fired three shots from a handgun at Gamboa, inflicting a relatively minor injury to Gamboa but fatally shooting Ah Loo.Two of the peacekeepers in neon vests allegedly saw Gamboa separate from the crowd of marchers in downtown Salt Lake City, move behind a wall and retrieve a rifle around 8pm, Redd said.When the two men in vests confronted Gamboa with their handguns drawn, witnesses said Gamboa raised his rifle into a firing position and ran toward the crowd, said Redd.That’s when one of the men in the bright vests shot three rounds, hitting Gamboa and Ah Loo, said Redd. Gamboa, who police said didn’t have a criminal history, was wounded and treated before being booked into jail.Detectives don’t yet know why Gamboa pulled out a rifle or ran from the peacekeepers, but they accused him of creating the dangerous situation that led to Ah Loo’s death. The Associated Press did not immediately find an attorney listed for Gamboa or contact information for his family in public records.The gunshots sent hundreds of protestors running, some hiding behind barriers and fleeing into parking garages and nearby businesses, police said in a statement. “That’s a gun. Come on, come on, get out,” someone can be heard saying in a video posted to social media that appears to show the events.Los Angeles police fire teargas to disperse crowds at Trump protestRead moreNo Kings protestsswept across the countryon Saturday, and organizers said millions rallied against what they described asDonald Trump’s authoritarian excesses.

So we were delayed in getting there because there was just so much damage.”Vargo added: “It happened so quickly and so fast … I’ve been doing this for 35 years. I’ve seen major floods here in the city and the county. I’ve never seen anything like this.”Authorities said vehicles were swept into in swollen creeks, some people sought safety in trees and a mobile home caught fire.Jim Blazier, the fire chief in Wheeling, in the state’s northern panhandle, said crews performed rescue operations into Sunday’s early morning hours. He said first responders regrouped on Sunday morning and were focused on an area from the Ohio state line across the Ohio River to Wheeling Creek.San Antonio: at least 11 people killed by floods as crews search for missingRead more“We’re searching the banks, we’re searching submerged vehicles, any debris we find along the trail and so forth,” Blazier said. “We’re using drones, search dogs and swift water personnel, and we have teams organized that are searching sectors that we’re trying to recover anybody that’s missing.”There were about 4,000 power outages in the county. Restoration efforts were hampered by natural gas leaks that have to be fixed first, officials said.Governor Patrick Morrisey declared a state of emergency in Ohio county. He said state police and other state officials were responding, and he directed the national guard to provide any needed assistance.“Please keep this community in your prayers,” Morrisey said in a statement on Sunday. “More storms are expected in the region today. Please follow all directives from local and state emergency management officials and do not attempt to drive through flooded roads.”The West Virginia rains followed heavydownpours in San Antonioon Thursday that killed 13 people. More than 7in (18cm) of rain fell over a span of hours in the Texas city, causing fast-rising floodwaters to carry more than a dozen cars into a creek.Explore more on these topicsWest VirginiaFloodingUS weatherExtreme weathernewsShareReuse this content"

Others dressed up in slacks and ties, and the sound of “Pope parking!” echoed through a megaphone from a nearby parking lot.There were Pope Leo jerseys, fans wearing head-to-toe papal outfits, and even a mural painted at the stadium. Fans made pilgrimages to seat two in row 19 of section 140, where he sat at the playoff game.Last year, the team set the record for most losses in a single season. Some are hoping for a little holy intervention in this year’s season.View image in fullscreenCardinal Blase Cupich, the archbishop of Chicago, during a mass at Rate Field in Chicago, Illinois, on Saturday.Photograph: Carlos Osorio/ReutersSaturday’s event kicked off at 2.30pm with an introduction from Chuck Swirsky, the play-by-play voice of theChicagoBulls, music from the Leo high school choir and Luis Galvez, and a panel discussion with Pope Leo’s former teacher and a high school classmate.The first American pope, although unable to attend the mass in person, shared a video message addressing the youth of the world displayed on the jumbotron at the stadium.In his video, Pope Leo said that young people, having lived through times of isolation and great difficulty in the pandemic, may have missed out on the opportunity to live as a part of a faith community. He encouraged young people to look into their hearts, “to recognize God is present”, in a seven-minute video message.The pontiff informed those watching that they are giving hope to many people in the world and that they are a source of “promoting peace [and] promoting harmony among all peoples”.Sandra Alders, from the Auburn-Gresham neighborhood, brought her two children to the event to experience this unique moment.“I just wanted my children to hear a message of inspiration,” she said.Alders hopes Pope Leo will appeal to young people who don’t feel connected to any church or any religion.“I want my children to feel like they belong, and I think him being someone we can connect to in our community is a great start,” she said.Jenn Wilson, a South Side transplant living in Evanston, said: “I don’t know if a ballpark mass will make mainstreamCatholicismcool for the kids. My own kids thought it was cool to have a Chicago Pope, but they’re also not rushing to mass.”Before the mass, Wilson said she was hopeful that there would be remarks that defy the current political state of America, as “they are in direct conflict with the philosophy of the Catholicism I was taught.”Starting at 4pm ET, an extravagant mass began at the stadium when the smell of incense wafted in the air as the entrance procession began. Like most masses, priests, bishops and altar servers walked with crosses and candles – except this time it was on a baseball field that holds 40,000 spectators.Underneath the Miller Time and Caesars Sportsbook signs, the Chicago cardinal, Blase Cupich, led the mass by saying: “I think I’m going to remember this moment as a sermon on the mound.”While Pope Leo didn’t directly touch on politics, Cupich said in his homily that while countries have a duty to secure their borders, “it is wrong to scapegoat those who are here without documents, for indeed they are here due to a broken immigration system.” Cupich has long been an advocate of respecting human rights and has spoken out against deportations.He went on to say that immigrants are here not by invasion but by invitation.“An invitation to harvest the fruits of the Earth to feed our families, an invitation to clean our tables, hotels and motel rooms. An invitation to landscape our lawns and, yes, even an invitation to take care of our children and our elderly,” he said.Pope Leo criticises ‘exclusionary mindset’ of nationalist political movementsRead moreRay Pingoy, the senior coordinator for Respect Life and Chastity Education for the Archdiocese of Chicago, asked world leaders in the Tagalog language to “respect in both word and deed the dignity of human person, especially immigrants and refugees.”The mass notably coincided with the thousands of“No Kings” protestsaround the country, and right beforeDonald Trump’s military parade.Words of pro-immigration were met with cheers and applause.Andrew DiMaggio drove from the suburbs and said he “couldn’t miss out on this opportunity as a White Sox fan. He’s our South Side Pope!”Wilson said she “never expected an American Pope, much less a Chicago Pope”.“At this moment, it feels like we have some acknowledgment as American Catholics to bring important things to the faith as a whole,” she said. “We bring a different sensibility that is based on basic kindness and pragmatism.”Explore more on these topicsChicagoPope Leo XIVThe papacyCatholicismReligionUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Boelter is also suspected of shooting Democratic state senator John Hoffman and his wife, Yvette, at their residence, gravely injuring them; a relative posted on Facebook that they were out of surgery and recovering.Authorities have disseminated photos of Boelter to border patrol agents in case he tries fleeing to Canada, CNNsaid.The Minnesota senator Amy Klobuchar said on Sunday that authorities believe Boelter remains in the midwest. Klobucharsaidon NBC’s Meet The Press that “he may be” in Minnesota and that law enforcement has issued an alert in South Dakota.“We believe he’s somewhere in the vicinity and that they are going to find him,” Klobuchar said. “But right now, everyone is on edge here because we know that this man will kill at a second.”An emergency alert was issued in Sibley county, which is approximately one hour from Minneapolis, around 12pm after Boelter’s vehicle was discovered, according tolocal Fox anchor Chenue Her. “Officials are telling residents nearby to take precaution as they continue searching for Boelter,” Her alsoreported.Klobuchar urged the public to be cautious if they see Boelter, warning they “should not approach him, that they should immediately call the tip lines and report”.View image in fullscreenAn FBI poster shows images of 57-year-old Vance Boelter, the primary suspect involved in the shooting deaths Melissa Hortman and her husband.Photograph: FBI/ReutersPolice responded to a shooting at Hoffman’s house at about 2am local time, then went to check on Hortman, who lives approximately 9 miles away. When they arrived there around 3.30am they encountered Boelter, who was dressed as a police officer.They said he exchanged shots with them before escaping on foot.Hoffman’s nephew, Mat Ollig, toldthe Minnesota Star Tribunethat both were recovering from surgery. In a Facebook post, Ollig said that Yvette saved their daughter’s life.“Early this morning, an absolute vile piece of shit dressed as a cop broke into my aunt and uncle’s house and shot him 6 and my aunt 5 times in a political act of terrorism. My aunt threw herself on her daughter, using her body as a shield to save her life,” Ollig wrote.“These two are the kindest, most giving and caring people I know. He went into politics to help people with disabilities get the care they need, and she works with young school children. They have always been there for me and everyone in our family and community.”Police said Boelter’s uniform might appear authentic to most people.Boelter also drove a vehicle that appeared identical to an SUV police squad car, said Mark Bruley, a local police chief. “It was equipped with lights, emergency lights, that looked exactly like a police vehicle, and yes, they were wearing a vest with Taser, other equipment, a badge very similar to mine, that, no question, if they were in this room, you would assume that they are a police officer,” Bruley said.Tim Walz, the governor ofMinnesota, said the murders appear “to be a politically motivated assassination”.The Federal Bureau of Investigation has offered a $50,000 reward for information leading to Boelter’s apprehension and conviction. He wasaddedto the FBI’s most wanted list on Saturday.Before the attacks he reportedly contacted two friends by text message, which they read aloud tothe Star Tribune: “I made some choices, and you guys don’t know anything about this, but I’m going to be gone for a while. May be dead shortly, so I just want to let you know I love you guys both and I wish it hadn’t gone this way.”He added: “I don’t want to say anything more and implicate you in any way because you guys don’t know anything about this. But I love you guys and I’m sorry for all the trouble this has caused.”Authorities reportedly said that Boelter left a list ofpotential targetsat the shooting scene. Multiple outlets have reported that it included pro-choice lawmakers, as well as reproductive health clinics.“There clearly was some through line with abortion because of the groups that were on the list, and other things that I’ve heard were in this manifesto. So that was one of his motivations,” Klobuchar said.She alsourgedthe public not to make any assumptions and allow investigators to work. “But again, they’re also checking out, did he have interaction somehow with these without legislators? Is there more to this?”The Milwaukee Journal Sentinelreportedthat 11 lawmakers in the state of Wisconsin were also among the targets listed in Boelter’s alleged manifesto.Hakeem Jeffries, the House minority leader, said on MSNBC that he expects to convene with congressional leaders to discuss ramping up security for lawmakers across the country in the wake of the deadly attacks.“This should be another wakeup call amongst many that have happened over the last several years, including, of course, the violent attack on the Capitol that took place on January 6,” Jeffriessaid.Explore more on these topicsMinnesotaUS politicsDemocratsUS crimenewsShareReuse this content"

But since Donald Trump’s return to office, one corner of civil society has been almost eerily quiet.Those leading corporate America rapidly turned down the volume after the president’s re-election. Gone are the days of political and social interventions, highly publicized diversity initiatives anddonationsto important causes.For months, some of the most powerful firms in the world have nervously navigated a dangerous US political landscape, desperate to avoid the wrath of an administration as volatile as it is vocal.“CEOs like two things. They like consistency and predictability,” said Bill George, former chairman and CEO of Medtronic and serial board director. “They like to know where things are going. No one can figure out where this administration’s really going, because everything is transactional.”View image in fullscreenJeff Bezos, Sundar Pichai and Elon Musk attend Trump’s inauguration in Washington DC, on 20 January 2025.Photograph: Shawn Thew/UPI/Rex/Shutterstock“Stay below the radar screen,” George has been advising senior executives across the US. “Do not get in a fight with this president.”Industry leaders from David Solomon of Goldman Sachs to Dara Khosrowshahi of Uberextoled the benefitsof“Trump accounts” for babiesthis week. It was the latest example of knee-flexing that began on the patio of Mar-a-Lago in the aftermath of Trump’s victory last November.The genuflections have been backed by big money, withmillions of dollarsthrown into the president’s inaugural fund by companies and executives. That started to look like chump change before long. Amazonreportedly paid $40mfor a documentary about Melania Trump. Apple announced plans toinvest $500bn in the US.But those moves do not appear to have bought much favor. The White HouseaccusedAmazon of being “hostile and political” following a report (upon which the company later poured cold water) that it would start disclosing the impact of Trump’s tariffs on prices. And the presidentthreatenedApple with vast tariffs.No CEO seemed closer to Trump than Elon Musk, the billionaire industrialist behind Tesla and SpaceX, who gave almost $300m to Republican campaigns last year, and worked in the administration for months. Their explosive fallout, days after Musk’s exit, prompted the president tothreaten the cancellation of federal contractsand tax subsidies for Musk’s companies.View image in fullscreenTrump speaks during a news conference with Musk in the Oval Office.Photograph: Evan Vucci/APThe pair’s rupture underlined why many executives are struggling to trust the president, according to Paul Argenti, professor of corporate communication at the Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth. “The mercurial nature of this guy kind of just seeps in, and people start to realize they’re dealing with something that’s a bit more difficult.”His advice? “Proceed with extreme caution.”“Loyalty only goes one way with Trump,” said Dan Schwerin, co-founder of Evergreen Strategy Group, and former speechwriter for Hillary Clinton, who has previously worked with firms including Levi Strauss and Patagonia. “This is like doing business with the mafia: you’re not going to win, and you’re not going to be safe.”The standard playbook is clear: “You make a big splashy announcement: the details don’t matter, you don’t have to follow through, but you placate the White House,” said Schwerin. “That maybe buys you a little time and a little goodwill.“But history suggests that Trump will do whatever is best for Trump, and he will turn on you in an instant, if it’s better for him. And that is true for his friends, so it will certainly be true for a company that he has no loyalty to.”Extreme caution has become the name of the game – anything to avoid your company getting drawn into the crosshairs of this administration. But companies can’t just focus on the president: they have shareholders, customers and employees to answer to.View image in fullscreenBrian Cornell, chairman and CEO of Target shakes hands with Trump in the Rose Garden of the White House on 13 March 2020.Photograph: Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images“You can’t base everything on getting through the next four years,” said George. “Yeah, it’s going to be chaotic. Yes, it’s going to be challenging. But you better hold firm to your purpose and your values.”He pointed to retailer Target, where he served on the board for 12 years. “They were very, very big on differentiating themselves from Walmart, using diversity as the criteria – and particularly being, they called themselves, the most gay-friendly company in town.“And then [Target CEO] Brian Cornell, six days after the inauguration, abandoned all that,” said George. The chain faced a backlash – and boycotts – for abruptly announcing the rollback of diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives. Breaking his silence in anemail to employeesthree months later, Cornell claimed: “We are still the Target you know and believe in.”Contrast this with Costco, another retailer, which in January faced a shareholder proposal against DEI efforts from a conservative thinktank. The firm’s board robustly defended its “commitment to an enterprise rooted in respect and inclusion” before the proposal was put to its investors for a vote.“They got a 98% vote to stay the course, to stay true to what they were,” said George. “And their customer base is very conservative. This is not like they have some liberal customer base.”Argenti believes the period of strategic silence by many companies, and knee-flexing to the White House, might be coming to a close following Musk’s messy exit. “We’re at an inflection point,” he said. “There’s going to period where people realize you’re damned if you do and damned if you don’t.”CEOs of companies counting the cost of Trump’s policies are “not going to suffer in silence”, he said. “You can’t win. It’s not like you can be secure in knowing if you follow this strategy, he’ll leave you alone.”View image in fullscreenWarren Buffett, chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway.Photograph: Nati Harnik/AP“We are starting to see the pendulum swing back,” according to Schwerin, who claimed the administration’s erratic execution of tariffs had “opened some people’s eyes” that its policies were bad for business.“I think it’s crucial that we start to see a little more pushback. Better to have a backbone than to just bend the knee.”On controversial issues at the heart of political discourse, however, George does not expect much of a shift from CEOs. “It is radio silence, and I think you’ll see that continuing. There’s not much to be gained from speaking out today.”“Stick to your lane,” he has been counseling executives. “If you’re a banker, you can talk about the economy. If you’re an oil expert ... talk to the energy industry. But you can’t speak ex-cathedra to everyone else.”“Only a handful” of business figures are deemed able to stand up and make bold public statements on any issue, according to George, who points to Jamie Dimon, the veteran JPMorgan Chase boss, andWarren Buffett, the longtime head of Berkshire Hathaway.“There are certain people who are really hard to take on. Jamie’s one,” he said. “If you were president of the United States, would you take on Warren Buffett?”Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationUS politicsDonald TrumpAmazonGoldman SachsJeff BezosUberfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The bad news was that his Bayern Munich teammates were a little more prolific, scoring 10 between them in the opening match of theirClub World Cupcampaign.If Gianni Infantino, the Fifa president, was hopinghis expanded Club World Cup– now containing 32 teams, playing across four weeks in 11 US cities – would showcase the depth of talent in global football, this was not a good example. The statistics were excruciating: the German champions had 31 shots – 17 of them on target – to Auckland’s one, and enjoyed 72% of possession.Messi shows glimpses of his genius on Fifa’s stage of fakery as Club World Cup beginsRead moreIt took 52 years for a team to score 10 goals in a World Cup game – Hungary beat El Salvador 10-1 in 1982 – but it’s taken just two games for a team to score 10 under the Club World Cup’s new format (the largest previous win at the tournament was 6-1, when Al-Hilal beat Al-Jazira in 2021 when just seven teams took part).There is some mitigation. While many argue that talent has been diluted by expanding the number of teams at this tournament, Auckland City have been a feature of the Club World Cup for some time: they have actually played at more editions than any other team. On the other hand, they’re not even the best team in Auckland, let alone New Zealand. Auckland City are part-timers, and the city’s professional team, Auckland FC, play in Australia’s A-League.“To be proud of the players is what we’re after. It’s a dream coming from an amateur level to play in this environment,” Auckland coach Ivan Vicelich said after the match, noting that some of his players had to take time off work to play in the tournament. “You can’t hide on the field. [I’m] really proud, a lot of players put in a good amount and worked really hard.”Jamal Musiala led the way for Bayern on Sunday with a second-half hat-trick. Thomas Müller, Michael Olise and Kingsley Coman scored two each, with Sacha Boey completing the rout.Some of the fans at at TQL Stadium took the opportunity to express their feelings on the tournament’s organisers. They unfurled a banner referencingthe 2015 arrest of officials at a Swiss hotelover allegations of corruption.

Later he added: “There’s no one to blame but myself, so I apologise to the whole team and to Oscar for attempting something probably a bit too silly. I’m glad I didn’t ruin his race.”The McLaren team principal, Andrea Stella, told Sky Sports: “We definitely never want to see the two McLarens touching each other. At the same time, it’s a contact that happened because of a misjudgment. Lando misjudged the distance to the car ahead. There was no malintent and Lando owned up immediately, took responsibility, which we appreciate. But it’s certainly something to discuss and review.”Piastri said the tussle between the two drivers had been a fair one. “It was a tough battle but a clean one. I don’t think there were any bad intentions involved, I think it was just unfortunate. We’re both fighting for a world championship and I’m very thankful to the team that they allow us to race. I don’t expect this to change anything in terms of that.”The long straights, heavy braking zones, kerbs and lack of long, fast corners at the Montreal circuit did not play to the strengths of McLaren’s car, which has set the pace everywhere else in 2025, and Norris is fortunate that his error cost him a fifth place, not second. It is not the first time Norris has made costly errors this season, while Piastri, a small error in Australia in greasy conditions apart, has been a model of consistency.Explore more on these topicsFormula OneMotor sportnewsShareReuse this content"

They intend to embrace Fifa’s newly revampedClub World Cup– a potential £97m prize pot for the eventual winners is quite the draw in an age of intense financial scrutiny, after all – and have travelled to the US knowing that the tournament gives them an opportunity to find out more about a squad that has evolved in the short space of time since Enzo Maresca’s side beat Real Betis in the Uefa Conference League final on 28 May.There has been little time to pause for breath before Chelsea get up and running in Group D by facing the Major League Soccer sideLos Angeles FCin Atlanta on Monday. Some players have had a 10-day break, others have been away on international duty and there has been no sign of anyone in the recruitment department taking a bit of annual leave.The sporting directors, Laurence Stewart and Paul Winstanley, have been busy assessing possible ins and outs. Joe Shields, the co-director recruitment of talent, has made his presence felt in thearrival of Liam Delapfrom Ipswich and the pursuit of the Borussia Dortmund winger Jamie Gittens. The pace is relentless. It speaks volumes that nobody raised an eyebrow at João Félix, who joined from Atlético Madrid for £45m less than a year ego, being left out of Chelsea’s 28-man squad last week.Messi shows glimpses of his genius on Fifa’s stage of fakery as Club World Cup beginsRead moreThe evolution is constant.Chelsea have shown decisiveness in their hunt for a new striker, moving swiftly to land Delap for the bargain price of £30m, while they have been clinical in other areas. They were right not to sign Jadon Sancho on a permanent basis, even though sending the winger back to Manchester United triggered a £5m penalty. Refusing to pay over the odds forGittens and the Milan goalkeeper Mike Maignanbefore the registration deadline for the group stages of the Club World Cup was also encouraging, especially as doing so was always going to be seen by more impatient supporters on social media as some kind of major negotiating fail.It is not as if the business has been limited to Delap. Space has been found in the travelling party for other newcomers – the 19‑year‑old goalkeeper Mike Penders, the 20-year-old centre‑back Mamadou Sarr, the 20-year-old midfielder Dário Essugo and the 21-year-old Brazilian prospect Andrey Santos, who developed well during a year on loan at Strasbourg, Chelsea’s partner club.Meanwhile there will be eyes on Palmeiras’s progress in Group A given that their18-year-old winger, Estêvão, is joining Chelsea after the tournament and is seen by many observers as a future Ballon d’Or winner. A late call has also been made for Kendry Páez, the Ecuadorian prospect, to travel to the US to train with his new clubmates before joining Strasbourg on loan.View image in fullscreenEstêvão (left) will have a chance to show what he will bring to Chelsea while representing Palmeiras at the Club World Cup.Photograph: Sebastião Moreira/EPAThis is a chance for Maresca to finesse patterns, improve old on-pitch relationships and develop some new ones. It is not ideal that Chelsea’s Premier League campaign will be compromised if they go all the way in the US – the final is less than a month before the start of the domestic season – but there is no point grumbling about fatigue. The reality is that Chelsea, whose endurance will also be tested by participation in the Champions League, are where they want to be. The club’s American owners, Todd Boehly and Clearlake Capital, are hardly going to complain about involvement in a month-long Stateside marketing extravaganza.Can Chelsea go all the way? Formidable opponents await them in the latter stages but they should make it through Group D with something to spare. LAFC offer the familiarity of the former Tottenham goalkeeper Hugo Lloris and the former Chelsea striker Olivier Giroud but both are past their best. Chelsea surely just need the right attitude. Further games against Espérance and Flamengo in Philadelphia look inviting enough.Yet the limited nature of the opposition will not stop Maresca from learning more about his players. There is scrutiny on the goalkeeping position following the move for Maignan, which did little to quell the impression that Chelsea will listen to offers for Robert Sánchez and Filip Jörgensen. Djordje Petrovic, meanwhile, is certain to leave after asking to be omitted from the squad. The Serbian goalkeeper impressed on loan at Strasbourg last season and wants regular football.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Sánchez retains the support of Ben Roberts, the global head of goalkeeping, and did well at the end of last season but whether Maresca fully trusts him is less clear. Chelsea have options. There is a lot of excitement about Penders, who will probably start as the third choice after Marcus Bettinelli’s move to Manchester City.The pressure to perform is clear. There is a battle for supremacy in attack. Delap, who scored 12 goals for Ipswich last season, has taken the No 9 shirt and will try to usurp Nicolas Jackson up front. How will Jackson respond? Talk of Chelsea looking to sign another striker raises questions over the Senegal international’s future.There are few untouchables at Stamford Bridge. The list of players who can leave is extensive. There are the expensive castoffs who have been left behind and have no future at the club – players such as Raheem Sterling, Axel Disasi, Christopher Nkunku, Ben Chilwell and João Félix – and then there are those such as Noni Madueke.

A few moments earlier he’d been introduced by a marketing manager who spoke about Lionel Messi’s new energy drink in tones of high-performance evangelism, gazing with doe-eyed wonder at the small plastic bottle in his hand and predicting that the “official hydration partner of the Argentine FA” (water: you’re out) would go on not just to make you less thirsty or become a popular choice in petrol stations, but to “inspire generations”. Here was a guy who has really drunk the Mas.Messi shows glimpses of his genius on Fifa’s stage of fakery as Club World Cup beginsRead moreAnd why not? The Mas by Messi launch was an intoxicating event. Beautiful fragrant people drifted about enjoying the Mas vibes, the Mas buzz, the bottomless Mas shots at the bar (“Try the Berry Mix, sir?”). Reporters and TV crews, the Mas Media, lurked at the fringes. Even the World Cup was here, lending its gravity from behind its bulletproof plinth.Mas does seem a fitting edition to the energy drink pantheon, in that it also tastes like someone has washed a packet of Skittles with sea water and collected it in a plastic skip. But perhaps the most striking thing, all the more so the morning after adistinctly framed Club World Cup opening night, is that it has an excellent name.Mas means more, as in more gas, ever deeper energy levels, and to be fair after spending the first 20 minutes like a man looking for his keys on the beach, Messi did get notably stronger as the night went on. Mas is also the name of the wealthy and useful owners of Inter Miami, Jorge and Jose.It captures in one word Fifa’s vision for football, which is basically gluttony, endless growth, the world is not enough.But above all of these things it’s good, current and culturally on point because it’s Spanish. And the one lesson so far of being around this roided-upClub World Cupis that Spanish is very clearly the lingua franca of this tournament, the language of football in America, and the language of elite football, as we say here, period.This is overwhelmingly a Hispano-Latin-Iberian tournament. And not just because it is based in South Florida, but structurally, economically and demographically.View image in fullscreenLionel Messi in action for Inter Milan during their goalless draw against Al Ahly.Photograph: Hannah McKay/ReutersFrom the US the furore over Trent Alexander-Arnold speaking a few words of Spanish seems doubly parochial. Not just because he now lives in Madrid and works for a Spanish employer. But because that elite tier of football, from players, to coaches to power brokers, is also speaking Spanish.The opening game was a massively Spanish/Hispanic/Central-South American affair, not just because 70% of the crowd were in Messi shirts, worn with the kind of event-zeal Americans bring to Halloween costumes or wearing a Pitbull scalp cap to a Pitbull show. The show was Spano-phile. the hype music was Latino club tune. Two days earlier the King of Football himself had delivered a rare video address at the Coral Gables golf club. And of course Gianni Infantino, for whom this was all, naturally,muy importante, spoke in spnissh.This applies just on the numbers. More than 300 South American players are here, a third of those taking part. A startling 105 Argentinian players are involved, 47 of them based outside Argentina. It feels like a moment of coronation for Argentina as the current chief single export power at this level of football. Guardiola‑ism remains, 20 years on, the tactical template for basically all football everywhere, to the extent the language of, even in English, is now Spanish-inflected, managers like Graham Potter and Enzo Maresca indefinably Spanish-styled.Club dressing rooms have long reflected this. Part of Luis Enrique’s transformation at Paris Saint-Germain has been to defeat “the divide”, the line between a previous Spanish-speaking mega-cartel and other parts of the squad. Asked to assess Kylian Mbappé’s suitability before his move to the French champions Messi himself commented at the time that Mbappé would be fine in Paris because “he speaks perfect Spanish”.Kalvin Phillips noted that one of the problems he found settling at Manchester City was the fact he didn’t speak Spanish, which sounds bizarre until you remember City have seven Spanish-speaking coaches, that John Stones had Spanish lessons to help him forge an understanding in defence, that Erling Haaland taking Spanish lessons even before he joined City was held up an example of his meticulous prep. Learning Spanish is probably the most obvious controllable element for anyone who wishes to make it in elite football now. José Mourinho, the translator, owes his career to his language facility. Infantino carries his mega-fluency like a weapon.It seems self-evident at this tournament, and self-evident given the holders of both men’s and women’s World Cup and Champions League are Spanish-speaking, given the makeup of recent world’s-best-player rosters, but this feels like a summit moment in football’s Spanish-inflected domination.And ever in place where everything from the opening night to the chat in the bars and buses and press conferences is in Spanish, football finds itself sitting naturally on a line of tension, a mirror to the world around it.View image in fullscreenRiver Plate players take part in a training session at Seattle Sounders’ complex.Photograph: Agustín Marcarian/ReutersFlorida’s tropical panhandle is also the site of Fifa’s newest HQ , a place that in turn sits right across one of the nation’s keenest racial and linguistic lines. Spanish is political here, both an immigrant language an the generational mother tongue of an influential part of the demographic. Nicaraguans, Venezuelans, Cubans and Mexicans have all been openly menaced by Donald Trump’s deportation rhetoric.Football has wrapped itself around this in Fifa’s key target market. The crowd that filled the stadium on Club World Cup opening night was hugely Latin, as was the crowd, to a lesser extent, at the No Kings protest in South Beach the same day, lining the pavements and grassy knolls, waving their placards in favour of Hispanic immigration rights, all beneath a vast Stalinist-scale mural of Messi himself, up above the fray like the eyes of Gatsby’s Doctor T.J. Eckleburg staring down sadly on the concerns of the world, while also, in a non-Mas twist, advocating the consumption of light Beer.There is a note of potential power shift here. Europe’s clubs will still dominate this Club World Cup, will scoop most of its $1bn prize pot, taking it back to the Uefa heartlands. The Premier League, which is only really an English entity in its geography, is the master of this process of talent outsourcing, a league so powerful it has in effect contracted out the production of talent and expertise.The Club World Cup may be driven by greed and the lust for power. It does, though, have a grain of a point when Fifa states that it might also become a redistributor of wealth. South America is keen on this tournament because it is a chance to take its own slice of the pie, perhaps even to reverse just a little its status as the production arm of European football, to halt that drift, the talent drain, to retain and develop more, to say, after many years as the colonial talent pool, No Mas.Explore more on these topicsClub World Cup 2025Lionel MessiClub World CupfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Lee Carsley’s side were frustrated in the first half against a Slovenia team who threatened at times, but Ethan Nwaneri and Harvey Elliott spurned golden opportunities. James Beadle, the England goalkeeper, played his part in keeping them level with decent saves to deny Svit Seslar.Harvey Elliott helps England make winning start in Euro Under-21 against CzechsRead moreEngland will have to wait to secure their qualification against Germany, needing a draw to be sure when they meet in Nitra on Wednesday, while Slovenia kept their slim hopes of progressing alive. Germany beat the Czech Republic 4-2 in the later game, clinching qualification with two wins from two and eliminating their opponents.Carsley told Uefa.com: “It was a very tough game. We definitely didn’t underestimate Slovenia, who are a good, well-organised team. I definitely think we had enough chances to win, though, so the frustration is that we didn’t take those opportunities.“I expect us to be better against Germany. I think we’ll need to freshen the team up. It’s important to take into consideration their age and the amount they’ve played, so we’ll make sure we utilise the squad.”Slovenia started brightly and came close when Seslar’s whipped free-kick deflected inches wide of the target. Beadle was then called into action for the first time to stop Seslar’s drilled effort with his legs.England’s first chance came in the 20th minute. James McAtee, the captain, dragged his close-range effort harmlessly wide. England should have been ahead just before the half-hour when Jonathan Rowe showed great feet to get past his marker and put the ball on a plate for Nwaneri but, with the goal at his mercy, he somehow missed an easy tap-in.View image in fullscreenEngland will be back playing with a backdrop of Nitra’s castle on Wednesday when they face Germany.Photograph: Radovan Stoklasa/ReutersSlovenia started to threat again, with Seslar proving a menace as he let rip with a ferocious effort from outside the box which Beadle did well to tip over the crossbar. England again came close to an opener before the break, Elliot Anderson superbly picking out the run of Elliott. He lifted his effort over Martin Turk, the Slovenia goalkeeper, only to see the ball bounce off the upright and away from danger. Another glorious chance went begging when Tino Livramento hooked the ball into the six-yard area and McAtee directed a shot on goal but Turk was in the right place to save.Slovenia almost made England pay for those missed opportunities as another chance fell to Seslar, but he saw a curling strike saved by Beadle. The England keeper said: “There are no easy games in this tournament and Slovenia have real quality. If you can’t win the game don’t lose it, and we move on. I’m satisfied with my personal performance, but obviously disappointed we didn’t win.”Omari Hutchinson, on as a substitute, injected some pace into England’s attack and his cross found Elliott, but he could not direct his header on target.England were denied in stoppage time as Brooke Norton-Cuffy’s pinpoint cross found Jack Hinshelwood. He directed a powerful header on target but Turk tipped the ball behind and secured an important point.McAtee said: “I’m a bit annoyed at myself for the chances I missed, but the same goes for the rest of the lads. We’re disappointed with the result, but it’s a point and we’ve got another game coming up soon, so we’ll focus on that.“With my first chance I thought I was offside and for the second the lads said it was a good save, but I should have finished it. There will be some fresh legs out there against Germany, so hopefully we can get the three points and top the group, because that’s our aim.”Explore more on these topicsEuropean Under-21 ChampionshipEngland Under-21snewsShareReuse this content"

An IPO is when a private company first sells shares to the public.Eagle documents seen by the Guardian show that the company has made a confidential S-1 filing, with institutional investors invited to buy shares in it. Neither the volume nor prices of the shares to be listed has been made public.Eagle has sustained heavy losses in recent years largely due to its big spending at Lyon, rather than Palace.Textor first announced plans for an Eagle IPO, which would be the first conducted by a multi-club football group, with a company valuation of $2bn (£1.47bn) last November, but the timing of the listing is curious given his involvement in sale talks at Palace, and the uncertainty over whether the club will beallowed to compete in the Europa Leaguenext season. Textor declined to comment or discuss his intentions.Lyon have also qualified for the competition and Uefa rules ­prevent clubs with the same owners both ­taking part. As previously revealed by the Guardian, Uefa has rejected an offer by Textor to put his 44.9% stake in Palace into a blind trust as he missed the 1 March deadline, and the American has since stepped up his efforts to sell.TheGuardian reportedon Thursday the New York Jets owner, Woody Johnson, has offered £190m to buy Textor’s shares in a move that would be welcomed by the club chair, Steve Parish, although that price is believed to be considerably short of his valuation. A consortium including the NBA player Jimmy Butler and the investment company Sportsbank has also made an offer.Textor’s preference would be to sell to fellow shareholders Josh ­Harris and David Blitzer, who each own 18% of the club, but despite months of negotiations they have been unable to agree on a price. Textor has spent around £180m on Palace since buying an initial 40% stake for £87m four years ago, with his investment crucial to the redevelopment of the club’s training ground and funding numerous player purchases, and is reluctant to sell at a big loss.Palace have expressed confidence they will be cleared by Uefa to take part in the Europa League on the grounds that Textor does not have a “decisive influence” at the club, and if they are thrown out are likely to appeal to the court of arbitration for sport. Uefa made renewed contact with Palace seeking clarification on elements of their submissions last week, which the club have interpreted as a positive sign.In a potentially worrying development for Palace, Drogheda United were expelled from the Conference League last week due to multi-club issues. The Irish Premier League club are owner by the American investors Trivela Group, whose Danish club Silkeborg have also qualified for the competition and been given primacy by Uefa as they finished higher in their domestic league.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The arranging of his medical in Rome, not Naples, played a part, avoiding the crowds that would have turned out to greet him. A handful of fans still found a way to be there when he arrived at the Villa Stuart clinic, 140 miles from their team’s home ground.Confirmation of his move came first from the Italian club’s owner, Aurelio De Laurentiis, who posted a picture to social media of them sitting side-by-side in director’s chairs. “Welcome Kevin!” were the accompanying words.The Joy of Six: Kevin De Bruyne at Manchester CityRead moreThe tonal shift from De Laurentiis’s earlier work was marked. This is a man who once unveiled Gökhan Inler – a Swiss international, but certainly a less noteworthy talent than De Bruyne – by having himshow up in a lion maskto a soiree on a cruise ship.Times change and so haveNapoli. A club that used to sell themselves as scene-stealing underdogs have begun to project a different image: of a team that know they can win trophies and intend to keep doing so; one whose international brand has strengthened to the point where they can sign a player such as De Bruyne.He is hardly the first big signing of De Laurentiis’s tenure. Gonzalo Higuaín had scored 121 goals for Real Madrid and won La Liga three times before he joined Napoli. Victor Osimhen cost more than €70m (£60m) to acquire from Lille.Still, De Bruyne belongs to a different category: one of the best performers in Premier League history, with six winners’ medals and two Premier League player‑of‑the-year awards – the latter achievement placing him in exalted company alongside Thierry Henry, Cristiano Ronaldo, Nemanja Vidic and Mohamed Salah. De Bruyne is also a Champions League winner, who pushed his body to breaking point to help Manchester City to get across the line in 2023.View image in fullscreenKevin De Bruyne holds aloft the Champions League trophy after Manchester City beat Inter in the 2023 final.Photograph: Martin Rickett/PASince buying the rights to a bankrupt club in 2004, De Laurentiis has rebuilt Napoli’s image in part through a strategy of progressively more high‑profile transfers and managerial appointments. Having made his fortune in the movie industry, he understands better than most the difference that a sprinkling of stardust can make.De Bruyne will be 34 by the time he plays his first game for Napoli and the past two years at City suggest his body is no longer capable of performing at the levels it once did. Even so, a player who chipped in eight goals and 17 assists in the past two Premier League seasons, while starting only 34 games, plainly still has things left to contribute. And his power as a leading man may yet be undimmed.According to the newspaper Il Corriere dello Sport, Napoli’s Instagram added 500,000 followers – more than 10% of their total – within hours of De Bruyne being announced. These are details that will make some football fans roll their eyes, but in the business of the modern game they matter.The year of Napoli and Scott McTominay: the Serie A season reviewRead moreSocial media following is one metric that companies assess when negotiating commercial deals with clubs. But there are more subtle impacts, too. It would be naive to imagine that footballers, each a brand in their own right, do not sometimes think about their teams’ online presence and how it ties up with their own.It is not so much that De Bruyne’s signing transforms the landscape for Napoli, but it might consolidate a trend. They have won two Serie A titles in three years, yet those successes have felt oddly unconnected – achieved under different managers with different tactics using different players in key roles.The 2022-23scudettowas a bolt from the blue, Luciano Spalletti harnessing the talent of a newly discovered Khvicha Kvaratskhelia as well as a breakout year for Osimhen.Last season was something different, a fresh project under Antonio Conte that came together quicker than anyone expected.“We had set ourselves the target of getting back into Europe, not even the Champions League,” Conte told Italy’s Sky Sport last week. “We wanted to have one more year of growth, then try to compete to win things in the third year.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Even as Napoli celebrated their title, his gestures toward De Laurentiis appeared frosty. Was it the promise of signing players such as De Bruyne that ultimately persuaded Conte to stay around?To reverse the question, how important was the manager’s presence in convincing De Bruyne to make this move? There were offers on the table from teams in the US and Saudi Arabia, but De Bruyne still has the itch to compete at Europe’s highest levels. Last season only confirmed Conte’s astonishing ability to deliver silverware almost everywhere he goes.View image in fullscreenKevin De Bruyne move to Naples has gone down well with the locals.Photograph: ANSA/EPAThen again, perhaps there were other factors. De Bruyne may have spoken to his Belgium teammate Romelu Lukaku, who racked up 14 goals and 10 assists after joining Napoli from Chelsea last summer. Or their compatriot Dries Mertens, who played nine seasons for thePartenopeiand fell so head-over-heels in love with the city that when he speaks of “home” this is still the place which he thinks of, despite leaving to join Galatasaray in 2022. Mertens was awarded honorary citizenship of Naples this month.Or maybe it was even just witnessing another player move here from Manchester and reimagine their career. Scott McTominay went from United cast-offto Serie A’s most valuable playerin nine months. It will be fascinating to see how Conte uses them together. He showed his flexibility this season, tearing up his original tactical plans to exploit the Scotland international’s strengths to the fullest.There is every reason to believe De Bruyne can be a hit, too. A cliche it may be, but it remains true that the football played in Serie A is slower and more tactical than that in the Premier League. With more time on the ball, he will have an opportunity to reinvent himself all over again – as he did repeatedly throughout the different chapters of his time under Pep Guardiola at City.Farewell Kevin De Bruyne: Manchester City’s genius and a law unto himself | Simon HattenstoneRead moreAs long ago as 2016, De Bruyne told Britain’s Sky Sports: “I am used to playing in six different positions.” By now we might be into double figures. He was at different times for City a box-to-box midfielder, a deep-lying playmaker, a winger, a No 10 and a false 9.“I still have a lot to give,” De Bruyne said this April, as he contemplated a life after City. “Obviously I know I’m not 25 any more, but I still feel like I can do my job.”He will do it now in Naples, under a manager who always wins and for an owner whose ambitions continue to grow. One of Conte’s oft-repeated frustrations last season was that his club had done its business late in the transfer window, leaving him little time to prepare. Signing De Bruyne this early may well signal a more aggressive summer ahead.Explore more on these topicsKevin De BruyneNapoliEuropean club footballfeaturesShareReuse this content"

After a better getaway, he didn’t need to, and fears that higher race-day temperatures might hamper the Mercedes tyre wear, proved unfounded. Verstappen was rarely more than two seconds behind but never close enough to launch an attack.“We knew we had the potential to win here and when it comes to ­fruition, it’s great,” Russell said. “It’s a bit of redemption after we should have won this race last year and my mistakes let the team down. I’m in a different place now, feel I’m driving better than ever and was chilled the whole race.”Behind Russell and Verstappen, the 18-year-old Mercedes rookie Kimi Antonelli became the third youngest driver to appear on an F1 podium after an accomplished race that got him to the finish ahead of the hitherto dominant McLarens.The McLaren team principal, Zak Brown, has conceded that with two evenly matched drivers in a potentially championship-winning car, an on-track contact between Lando ­Norris and Oscar Piastri was more a question of when, than if. The Montreal race proved the truth of his words as, three laps from the end as they battled over fourth place, Norris hit the back of Piastri’s car as he attempted to pass going down to Turn 1.View image in fullscreenGeorge Russell and Mercedes teammate Kimi Antonelli celebrate on the podium.Photograph: Shawn Thew/EPANorris had looked the quicker McLaren driver all weekend but two mistakes in qualifying, when he missed the chicane and then clipped the wall at Turn 7, put him on the back foot, seventh on the grid. In the race, however, he ran an offset tyre ­strategy and had relentlessly closed Piastri down before their collision.His opportunity came when Piastri caught traffic at an inopportune moment, allowing Norris to close to within DRS range. As they ran ­side-by-side down the main straight into the chicane, Piastri successfully defended the inside, so Norris flicked back to try around the outside as they fought out the racing line into Turn 1. But his front wing clipped Piastri’s left rear tyre, ending his race.Norris was quick to hold up his hands over team radio: “All my bad, all my fault, stupid from me,” he said.The incident brought out the safety car and there was insufficient time to resume the race. Russell, braking suddenly trying to get some heat into his brakes in anticipation of a restart, was illegally passed by Verstappen behind it, but the Dutchman claimed that he was caught unawares by ­Russell’s aggressive braking. It was just the latest in a series of spats between the pair, but came to nought as time ran out, withRed Bulllodging a post-race protest against Russell.F1 standingsThe collision with Piastri dealt a blow to Norris’s world championship hopes. Although McLaren could not challenge the Mercedes and Red Bull, Piastri’s fourth place increased his lead over Norris to 22 points, 10 races into the 24-race season.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Duplantis delighted the Stockholm crowd by clearing 6.28m on his first attempt after raising the bar from 6m.It was the 12th time the two-time Olympic champion, who was born in the US but competes for Sweden, has broken the pole vault world record. In Stockholm he improved on his previous record, set in February, by 1cm on his first attempt.Having promised fans that he would try to break the record, Duplantis encouraged the crowd to get behind him from the moment his name was announced at the Olympiastadion and they responded by wildly clapping and cheering his every attempt as he cruised through the competition. Kurtis Marschall did his best to challenge the hometown favourite, but the Australian could manage a best of 5.90 before making three unsuccessful attempts to clear 6m.That left the field clear for Duplantis as the bar was raised to 6.28 for his world record attempt, and once again, the 25-year-old made it look easy. He powered through his run-up before planting his pole and soaring to another world record as the stadium, built for the 1912 Olympics, exploded in jubilation.Duplantis sprinted from the landing mat, tearing off his singlet to celebrate his first world record set on Swedish soil with his partner and family. “This was one of my biggest goals and dreams, to set a world record here at Stadion,” Duplantis said. “It’s like the Olympics and Stadion, they’re the same level for me. I really wanted to do it, I had my whole family here, from both sides, it’s magic, it’s magic.“Every time I broke the world record, I felt it in my first jump that ‘this could be the day’, but today it felt a little tougher. It didn’t feel that natural from the beginning, it didn’t feel great in my legs, but I only needed one [try].”Despite the confident impression he gave as he sailed over the bar, Duplantis said he was not convinced he had cleared it until his back hit the mat. “I almost couldn’t believe it, it felt like the very first time I broke the record. For me, I’m still a little hazy in my mind, it feels unreal, I’m just so happy, it’s a cloud nine feeling. It’s hard to explain, it’s hard to compare, it felt a bit like the Olympics.”Hunter Bell, the 1500m bronze medallist at Paris last summer, surged down the last 50 to win the women’s 800m in 1:57:66. The Briton had to take the long route to the finish line in lane three, but had too much power for Kenya’s 2023 world champion Mary Moraa and South Africa’s Prudence Sekgodiso. Great Britain’s Jemma Reekie also ran a season best time to finish fifth in 1:58:66.Dina Asher-Smith clocked 10.93sec to finish second in the 100m behind the Olympic champion Julien lfred, who won in 10.75. Daryll Neita was fifth in 11.17. The world indoor champion Amber Anning finished third in the women’s 400m, behind the American Isabella Whittaker in a season’s best 50.17.Innes Fitzgerald and Hannah Nuttall ran respective personal best times of 8:32:90 and 8:33:82 to finish third and fourth in the women’s 3,000m.George Mills was fifth in the men’s 1500m in a season best time of 3:32:67. Alastair Chalmers was also fifth in the 400m hurdles, in which the Dutch athlete Femke Bol blazed away over the last 100m to win in a season-best time for her of 52.11, eight-tenths of a second ahead of the American Dalilah Muhammad in second.Explore more on these topicsAthleticsWorld recordsnewsShareReuse this content"

We managed to defend the [yellow] jersey and we can go home happy and prepare for the Tour.”The German Florian Lipowitz completed the podium, 2min 38sec behind Pogacar, while Belgium’s Remco Evenepoel came fourth at 4:21.Sunday’s final stage was a 133.3km mountainous trek from Val-d’Arc to Val-Cenis, with an uphill finish at the Plateau du Mont-Cenis. The 21-year-old Martinez caught the Spaniard Enric Mas with 8km to go to give France its first victory in this Dauphiné, finishing 34sec ahead of Vingegaard and Pogacar.Vingegaard tried to catch Martinez but was unable to shake off Pogacar. The Dane and the Slovenian then stopped attacking and rolled in together. Pogacar now has 99 victories to his name, a record for an active rider at just 26 years of age.“There’s a lot of positives from this week and we turned all the negatives into positives, so it’s all good,” said Pogacar, who bounced back from a poor time-trial performance in stage four to lay down the gauntlet to his principal Tour rivals. “There’s not much to do ahead of the Tour. I rest a bit, maybe some extra work for the time trial, and then I’m ready,” the three-time Tour winner added.The 2025 Tour de France runs from 5-27 July, with Pogacar the firm favourite after his first Dauphiné crown.Explore more on these topicsCyclingTadej PogačarnewsShareReuse this content"

McIlroy’s practice round at Quail Hollow was watched by more than 50, inside the ropes. Journalists, content creators, wannabe content creators … everyone wanted not just a glimpse – you can get that from the bleachers – but a piece of golf’s latest grand slam man. McIlroy played a hole while being interviewed for the tournament’s main preview show. All soft, knock‑around stuff but inevitably a distraction.It was difficult to shake the notion that Tiger Woods would never have tolerated such a scenario. It is also thankfully a truism that McIlroy is not Tiger Woods. The Northern Irishman’s chatty, warm personality endears him to so many. In a non-tribal sport people root for Rory, none more so than at Augusta National when more than a decade of frustration endedamid euphoric April scenes. Hardened men shed tears in a media centre, no less.Tyrrell Hatton cool but Matt Fitzpatrick rages as Sam Burns keeps US Open leadRead moreIn Pittsburgh, you needn’t go far to encounter complaint at the long‑term decline of the Pirates. Even an iconic ballpark cannot pull in the masses any more. A few miles away at Oakmont, golf’s chattering classes have a gripe of their own: Rory McIlroy and a refusal to engage as before with the media. It is a preposterous discussion on one level, as if four minutes of quotes after a 75 somehow affects McIlroy’s legacy as much as Masters glory. Yet it is also an intriguing one, if only when assessing why the 36-year-old turned mute.The simple answer is McIlroy is irritated, not unreasonably, after giving the very people now sniping probably the greatest story they will ever report. None of them were in New Orleans for McIlroy’s first post‑Masters appearance, where the five-time major winner was perfectly expansive.Within two days of McIlroy being pursued by all and sundry at Quail Hollow, news emerged that his driver hadfailed a routine conformance test. This was a clumsy situation, largely on account of a needlessly secretive process, but it was only McIlroy’s name that surfaced. It did via a partner broadcaster, which will have turned heads in Camp McIlroy. Conspiracy theorists ignored the fact he was 175th on the PGA Tour’s driver accuracy table heading into the US PGA. There is a reason a seven-iron sits in his display cabinet in Augusta’s champions locker room.View image in fullscreenRory McIlroy talks with Shane Lowry during the Zurich Classic in New Orleans in April.Photograph: Gerald Herbert/APHeadlines subsequently surrounded his failure to play the Memorial tournament in Ohio. The event had never appeared on his schedule in the first place. Far more significant than McIlroy not advertising his plans is that he deems big events on the PGA Tour worthy of skipping. McIlroy has spoken about scaling down his playing commitments in the US; he will instead appear in India and Australia in 2025. The US‑obsessed PGA Tour should be concerned by its biggest draw’s dream of a properly global sport.Sportspeople often speak of regret having not enjoyed their highest highs. With Green Jacket in tow, McIlroy headed to England and Northern Ireland. He did the chatshow circuit in New York. Presumably he found the Europa League final as tedious as the rest of us but he made sure he had a front-row seat in Bilbao.The resetting of goals, the hitting of more greens, can wait. Few people know what on earth it is like to wake up one morning knowing the only thing that has got you out of bed for the past 10 years is now on your CV. A McIlroy psychological adjustment from this position is as necessary as it may be difficult. He is cheesed off that he is not playing well – a matter only exaggerated at Oakmont’s brutal setup – when there is an abundance of rationale behind that. He is out of competitive sync.“It’s really hard to describe to somebody that hasn’t really lived through it,” Scottie Scheffler said. “When I woke up after [winning] the PGA Championship this year, I literally felt like I got hit by a bus. I felt terrible. Mentally it is exhausting, physically it is a grind. I can only imagine how Rory felt after winning the career grand slam.”After his third round at this US Open, he stood before the media when giving the impression he would rather be undergoing root canal treatment. He had skipped post‑round duties for the previous six rounds in a row, only one of which was sub‑70.Until the tournament obligates players to talk when requested – which is precisely what they should do – McIlroy can demonstrate his general annoyance in this way. Golf’s clickbait modern media world means he has no scope to speak on an off-the-record basis.“I feel like I’ve earned the right to do whatever I want to do,” McIlroy said. His wording here was unusually crude, making him look entitled; which he is not. Even when trying to pay lip service, he cannot stop turning heads. His admission that he didn’t care whether he made the Oakmont cut was as brutally honest as it was striking.View image in fullscreenRory McIlroy, on his knees on the 18th green, celebrates winning the Masters in a playoff.Photograph: Brian Snyder/ReutersMcIlroy has been irritated by elements of the media before. Last summer, he changed his phone number after untimely and intrusive messages asking for his thoughts onlosing by a shotto Bryson DeChambeau at the US Open. McIlroy has never really explained his famous “if you want to be in the circus, you have to put up with the clowns” comment of more than a decade ago but it appeared a pointed reference to press speculation. Despite these and other minor rumbles, McIlroy has been great for reporters; a constant source of news and unfailingly helpful towards those with whom he has built up proper relationships.The sporting public will remember his wondrous shot into the 15th at Augusta on Masters Sunday. They will recall a young man beating the turf on the 18th green while in floods of joyous tears. The media has played a part in McIlroy’s profile and undoubtedly will do again. It is just that turning indifference from the golfer towards some of that group as a huge deal or grave error at this particular point in time feels needlessly self-aggrandising.Explore more on these topicsRory McIlroyUS OpenPGA TourGolfUS sportsEuropean TourcommentShareReuse this content"

That was up from 1.6 cases per 1,000 in 2022-23.Figures up to May suggest that number will increase again this year to about 7.5 proven cases per 1,000 students – but recorded cases represent only the tip of the iceberg, according to experts.The data highlights a rapidly evolving challenge for universities: trying to adapt assessment methods to the advent of technologies such as ChatGPT and other AI-powered writing tools.In 2019-20, before the widespread availability of generative AI, plagiarism accounted for nearly two-thirds of all academic misconduct. During the pandemic, plagiarism intensified as many assessments moved online. But as AI tools have become more sophisticated and accessible, the nature of cheating has changed.The survey found that confirmed cases of traditional plagiarism fell from 19 per 1,000 students to 15.2 in 2023-24 and is expected to fall again to about 8.5 per 1,000, according to early figures from this academic year.A series of charts showing proven misconduct cases per 1,000 students. Plagiarism rises from 2019-20 to 2022-23 then drops back again, while AI-related misconduct rises from 2022-23 to almost the same level as plagiarism. ‘Other misconduct’ remains fairly stable.The Guardian contacted 155 universities under the Freedom of Information Act requesting figures for proven cases of academic misconduct, plagiarism and AI misconduct in the last five years. Of these, 131provided some data – though not every university had records for each year or category of misconduct.More than 27% of responding universities did not yet record AI misuse as a separate category of misconduct in 2023-24, suggesting the sector is still getting to grips with the issue.Many more cases of AI cheating may be going undetected. A survey by the Higher Education Policy Institute in February found88% of studentsused AI for assessments. Last year, researchers at the University of Readingtested their own assessment systemsand were able to submit AI-generated work without being detected 94% of the time.Dr Peter Scarfe, an associate professor of psychology at the University of Reading and co-author of that study, said there had always been ways to cheat but that the education sector would have to adapt to AI, which posed a fundamentally different problem.He said: “I would imagine those caught represent the tip of the iceberg. AI detection is very unlike plagiarism, where you can confirm the copied text. As a result, in a situation where you suspect the use of AI, it is near impossible to prove, regardless of the percentage AI that your AI detector says (if you use one). This is coupled with not wanting to falsely accuse students.“It is unfeasible to simply move every single assessment a student takes to in-person. Yet at the same time the sector has to acknowledge that students will be using AI even if asked not to and go undetected.”Students who wish to cheat undetected using generative AI have plenty of online material to draw from: the Guardian founddozens of videoson TikTok advertising AI paraphrasing and essay writing tools to students. These tools help students bypass common university AI detectors by “humanising” text generated by ChatGPT.Dr Thomas Lancaster, an academic integrity researcher at Imperial College London, said: “When used well and by a student who knows how to edit the output, AI misuse is very hard to prove. My hope is that students are still learning through this process.”Harvey* has just finished his final year of a business management degree at a northern English university. He told the Guardian he had used AI to generate ideas and structure for assignments and to suggest references, and that most people he knows used the tool to some extent.“ChatGPT kind of came along when I first joined uni, and so it’s always been present for me,” he said. “I don’t think many people use AI and then would then copy it word for word, I think it’s more just generally to help brainstorm and create ideas. Anything that I would take from it, I would then rework completely in my own ways.“I do know one person that has used it and then used other methods of AI where you can change it and humanise it so that it writes AI content in a way that sounds like it’s come from a human.”Amelia* has just finished her first year of a music business degree at a university in the south-west. She said she had also used AI for summarising and brainstorming, but that the tools had been most useful for people with learning difficulties. “One of my friends uses it, not to write any of her essays for her or research anything, but to put in her own points and structure them. She has dyslexia – she said she really benefits from it.”The science and technology secretary, Peter Kyle,told the Guardianrecently that AI should be deployed to “level up” opportunities for dyslexic children.Technology companies appear to be targeting students as a key demographic for AI tools. Googleoffers university studentsa free upgrade of its Gemini tool for 15 months, and OpenAI offers discounts to college students in the US and Canada.Lancaster said: “University-level assessment can sometimes seem pointless to students, even if we as educators have good reason for setting this. This all comes down to helping students to understand why they are required to complete certain tasks and engaging them more actively in the assessment design process.“There’s often a suggestion that we should use more exams in place of written assessments, but the value of rote learning and retained knowledge continues to decrease every year. I think it’s important that we focus on skills that can’t easily be replaced by AI, such as communication skills, people skills, and giving students the confidence to engage with emerging technology and to succeed in the workplace.”A government spokesperson said it was investing more than £187m in national skills programmes and had published guidance on the use of AI in schools.They said: “Generative AI has great potential to transform education and provides exciting opportunities for growth through our plan for change. However, integrating AI into teaching, learning and assessment will require careful consideration and universities must determine how to harness the benefits and mitigate the risks to prepare students for the jobs of the future.”*Names have been changed.Explore more on these topicsHigher educationStudentsUniversitiesPlagiarismExamsArtificial intelligence (AI)ChatGPTnewsShareReuse this content"

The only available diversion was a button that delivered a painful electric shock.Almost half of theparticipants pressed it. One man pressed the button 190 times – even though he, like everyone else in the study, had earlier indicated that he found the shock unpleasant enough that he would pay to avoid being shocked again. The study’s authors concluded that “people prefer doing to thinking”, even if the only thing available to do is painful – perhaps because, if left to their own devices, our minds tend to wander in unwanted directions.Since the mass adoption of smartphones, most people have been walking around with the psychological equivalent of a shock button in their pocket: a device that can neutralise boredom in an instant, even if it’s not all that good for us. We often reach for our phones for something to do during moments of quiet or solitude, or to distract us late at night when anxious thoughts creep in. This isn’talwaysa bad thing – too much rumination is unhealthy – but it’s worth reflecting on the fact that avoiding unwanted mind-wandering is easier than it’s ever been, and that most people distract themselves in very similar, screen-based ways.Most psychologists would agree that, while it can feel unpleasant, getting bored is usefulSmartphones have also increased the pressure to use our time productively, to optimise every minute of our lives. If once a harried commuter might have been forced to stare out of the window or read a book on the train to work, now they may try to catch up on their emails to avoid feeling guilty and inefficient. To sit and do nothing is seen as a waste of time. But that ignores the fact that when we’re doing nothing we’re often thinking quite hard. What happens to all those difficult or untamed half-thoughts that start to form in the milliseconds before we dig into our pockets and pull out our phones again?Most psychologists studying boredom would agree that, while it can feel unpleasant, it’s useful. Like hunger or loneliness, it alerts us to a need, a desire to do something different. According to Erin Westgate, assistant professor of psychology at the University of Florida, we become bored if something fails to absorb our attention, or when we perceive it as meaningless. This is not to say that something needs to be both engaging and meaningful to keep us interested: doing sudoku might be absorbing but relatively meaningless, while reading a Peppa Pig bedtime story for the 500th time is not engaging but may nonetheless feel like a meaningful thing to do. Watching paint dry is both unstimulating and pointless, which is why it isn’t a common pastime.In any case, when boredom strikes it should ideally serve as a prompt to do something more engaging or meaningful. If you don’t react appropriately to your boredom, or perhaps if engaging or meaningful things aren’t available to you for whatever reason, you may find yourself becoming chronically bored. That isassociated with a range of problems, including depression, anxiety, poor life satisfaction, lower academic achievement, substance abuse and excessive risk-taking.There is evidence to suggest that chronic boredom is becoming more common, and that this uptick has coincided with the rise of smartphones. In apaper published last year, researchers noted that the proportion of students in China and the US who described themselves as bored steadily increased in the years after 2010, during the first decade of smartphone dominance. Why might digital media have this effect? Research has shown that the main reason we pick up our phones or check our socials is to relieve boredom, but that the behaviour actually exacerbates it. One study, for instance, found that people who were bored at work were more likely to use their smartphones – andsubsequently feel even more bored.It may be that checking your phone only addresses part of what you need when you start to feel bored. Digital devices are very good at attracting your attention – in fact, everything you interact with on a screen has been designed to capture, hold and monetise it – but much of what we do online doesn’t feel meaningful. It’s incredibly easy to plan to look at your phone for just five minutes and resurface two hours later with Mastermind-level knowledge of the latest Blake Lively controversy or your ex’s holiday plans. The average American spendsmore than four hours a day ontheir smartphone and more than seven hours a day in total online. That adds up to spending 17 years of your adult life browsing the internet. I expect that even the biggest technophiles would agree that this isn’t how they want to spend their one precious life.Phones’ efficacy at whisking us into superficial stimulation short-circuits our boredom and allows us to swiftly evade messages that we might need to hear, such as “Why am I feeling this?” or “What do I need that I’m not getting?” If we pause and listen, then perhaps we can make a choice rather than being manipulated by software engineers. When boredom strikes, we should resist the urge to assuage it instantly and ask ourselves: are we in search of pure entertainment or something more purposeful, an opportunity to connect with friends or our community or something different, something new? The people who choose to embrace boredom, at least for a while, may paradoxically experience less of it. It could even be the first step towards a life that feels more stimulating overall: meaningful, creative and free.Further readingBored and Brilliantby Manoush Zomorodi (Pan Macmillan, £14.99)Digital Minimalismby Cal Newport (Penguin, £10.99)The Antidoteby Oliver Burkeman (Vintage, £10.99)Explore more on these topicsPsychologyThe big ideaInternetSmartphonesMobile phonesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Online banking may be blocked, cash machine withdrawals denied, and commuters left in limbo as buses and petrol stations reject payments. News of the attack could spark panic, leading to a run on rival lenders, as customers pull money from their accounts amid fear the disruption could spread.This situation may seem far-fetched but it is not a long way off from the government’s “reasonable worst-case scenario” if a sophisticated cyber-attack hit a big UK bank. With the financial industry among 14 sectors categorised as “critical national infrastructure”, it is no surprise that a hack islisted on the national risk register,which models some of the biggest threats facing the UK.Billions of pounds are being spent preventing the kind of devastating attacks thatshut down systems at three retailers,Harrods, the Co-op and M&S, this spring.“The amount of money [that] banks, all of us, will be spending on our systems is enormous today. And it has to be,” the UK chief executive of HSBC, Ian Stuart, told MPs last month. “We are being attacked all the time.”View image in fullscreenM&S was forced to pause online orders for six weeks after a cyber-attack.Photograph: Yui Mok/PAHSBC alone is having to invest hundreds of millions of pounds to protect itself, Stuart said. “This is our biggest expense.”Globally, banks are expected to allocate 11% of their IT budgets to cybersecurity in 2025, according to an EY study. With those IT budgets forecast to hit$290bn (£214bn)this year, according to the research body Celent, banks could end up shelling out $32bn on cybersecurity by December.It is a new era for high street banks, as attempted heists evolve from criminals in balaclavas hitting physical branches and vaults to state-sponsored hackers and independent cybergroups looking for ransom payments or merely to cause mass disruption.“Banks have understood the risk far better than probably a lot of other industries. They’ve invested far more in security,” said Stuart McKenzie, a managing director for Mandiant Consulting, a Google-owned cybersecurity company that works closely with a number of lenders in the UK.Last month the governor of the Bank of Englandtold the BBCthat cybersecurity was a risk that was never going away because it continually evolved. “We’re dealing with bad actors who will continually refine the lines of attack. And I always have to say to institutions: ‘You’ve got to continue to work at this,’” Andrew Bailey said.However, protecting systems is a complex task. Most high street banks operate on an onion-like IT system, with layers upon layers of updates, patches and add-ons. Throw third-party software and cloud providers into the mix, and banks are left playing whack-a-mole.“We call it the attack surface,” Alan Woodward, a professor and cybersecurity expert at the University of Surrey, said. “The attack surface has actually increased, so the opportunities for attackers to try to look for ways in have also increased.”No bank hacks to date have been disruptive enough to bring a country to an economic standstill – althoughApril’s power blackout across the Iberian peninsulaexposed how reliant modern societies are on digital payments. Where hackers have been successful, they have more often than not targeted banks’ customer data and accounts.In 2021, attackers on the US bank Morgan Stanley stole personal informationbelonging to its corporate clientsby hacking into a server used by a third-party consulting company.A year earlier, at the start of the Covid pandemic, attackers got hold of staff mailboxes at the Italian state-owned bank Monte dei Paschi, and sent emails to clients with voicemail attachments.View image in fullscreenHackers found a way to guess bank card details and steal almost £2.5m from 9,000 accounts at Tesco Bank in 2016.Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The GuardianMeanwhile, one ofthe most devastating hacks on a UK bankcame in 2016, when criminals found a way to guess bank card details and steal almost £2.5m from 9,000 accounts at Tesco Bank. Tesco wasforced to halt all online and contactless card transactionsafter struggling to block fake purchases taking place around the world, including Spain and Brazil.Tesco Bank eventually reimbursed customers in full.The National Cyber Security Centre says customers who suspect a hack should contact their bank using their official website or social media channels, and avoid using any links or contact details they have been sent. The organisation should be able to confirm if a hack has actually taken place, how they have been affected and what they need to do next.The Bank of England has tried to stay a step ahead. Policymakers officially recognised cybersecurity as a risk to financial stability in 2013 and started to implement cyber resilience standards for all regulated banks and insurers under its supervision.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Policymakers assume a cyber-attack will eventually be successful and are therefore pushing banks to prepare their response and recover plans that would avoid long-lasting outages that could bring pockets of the economy to a standstill.The Cross Market Business Continuity Group, which brings together regulators and members of the bank industry body UK Finance, boasts the ability to summon about 100 companies for emergency group calls in under an hour to discuss a potential attack.Fending off a hack is seen as vital to protect an industry that ultimately trades on trust: customers expect lenders to keep their information, wages and life savings protected from outside threats.“If somebody breaks in there and manages to make a fraudulent transaction … you’re not going to trust that bank again with your money, are you?” Woodward said.Banks have already experienced the backlash that can erupt from mere IT outages, without any malicious actors trying to disrupt the banking system or steal data and cash.TSB has for years been working to restore its reputation after itsIT meltdown in 2018, caused by its botched separation from Lloyds’ internal systems, which left millions of banking customers locked out of their accounts for weeks. The lender was subsequentlyfined £48m for “widespread and serious” failings.View image in fullscreenTSB has for years been working to restore its reputation after its IT meltdown in 2018.Photograph: Andrew Matthews/PAOutages have continued to plague customers of Britain’s largest banks and building societies, who suffered the equivalent of more thana month of IT failuresbetween January 2023 and February 2025, according to the data gathered by the parliamentary Treasury committee.“The security of customer money and data is of paramount importance to banks, not just because it’s a requirement under regulation but because it’s the way that banks do business,” Laura Catterick, a director focused on resilience and cybersecurity at UK Finance, said.“I would say, never rule out a cyber-attack. But I would say, there should be confidence in the amount of cyber defences in place.”Explore more on these topicsBankingCybercrimeHackingInternetTechnology sectorfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It sounds great – it’s remote working and you could earn up to £800 a day. If you’re interested, you just need to contact the sender via the WhatsApp number provided.The job is pretty easy: you are asked to like and share content – usually onTikTok.“After you’ve starting liking and sharing content you receive a small payment, which is fraudulent funds from other people involved in the scam,” says Annya Burskys, the head of fraud operations at Nationwide building society. “Then you’re told that you need to pay a sum to unlock higher earnings – you may be told it’s for training.“Some of that money is used to pay other victims, and some goes into the hands of the organised crime gang.”Burskys says the original messages are proving an attractive proposition to people – particularly students.“We’re starting to see an uptick, particularly in the 16-25 age group,” she says. “Last year, we weren’t seeing these daily. Now it’s multiple cases a day, either of people who have sent money, or we’re receiving reports from other banks who have customers who have sent money to customers’ accounts.”In the latter cases, victims may have been persuaded to act as“money mules”– allowing their accounts to be used by the scammers to process payments.As well as handing over money, or accounts, victims may also find that the bank and identity details they are asked for are used for other scams.Burskys says typical losses have been in the hundreds or thousands of pounds. “It’s not the highest value – the problem is the volume,” she says. “It happens very quickly – from setup to speaking to realising you’re a scam victim is days, whereas your typical investment scam plays out over months or years.”As universities and schools break up, and students start looking for summer work, they need to beware the scammers.What the scam looks likeView image in fullscreenThe figure of £800 seems to appear a lot. The scam text will ask you to get in touch via a WhatsApp number.Photograph: The GuardianTexts claim to be from a recruitment agency – sometimes using the name of a legitimate company – or from TikTok and say there is work available. Some mention your CV, as if you have sent it in. The texts say you can earn hundreds of pounds a day (the figure £800 seems to appear a lot), and ask you to get in touch via a WhatsApp number.The phone calls are similar. In one this week an automated voice claimed to be from the recruitment agency Indeed and said a job was available and if the recipient was interested they should get in touch via WhatsApp. The phone number seemingly belonged to a regular UK mobile.View image in fullscreenSome of the scams mention your CV, as if you have sent it in. The texts say you can earn hundreds of pounds a day.Photograph: The GuardianWhat the messages ask forThe first message asks you to register your interest in a job. The scammers will then tell you the job involves liking and sharing content – probably TikTok videos. You might be asked for your details when you sign up, or when it comes time to receive some pay.You may receive a first “wage” but then you will be asked to pay for training, or similar, so you can unlock higher earnings.What to doBeware of any unsolicited message claiming to offer work. This is not a typical way for a legitimate agency to approach people. The agency Indeed says: “Indeed never contacts jobseekers directly by phone on behalf of employers using our platform to find and hire new employees.”Burskys says if you hear from a recruiter or company offering you a job you should “use Companies House, use LinkedIn to research them”. Companies House will show you if a company is operating, who its directors are and where it is based. You can check this against any details you have been given.If you recognise the name of the recruitment company, go to its website and see whether the job is advertised on there.In the UK, forward scam texts to 7726.Many recruiters have tips on how to carry out your job search safely, such as these fromIndeed.Explore more on these topicsConsumer affairsScam watchTikTokfeaturesShareReuse this content"

So its not shocking to read recent news stories about how somebusinessesare trying toskirtaroundtariffs– particularly fromChina.They’re shipping goods through third countries, rather than directly from China, usingspecial “shoppers”to skirt minimum quantity amounts, colluding with suppliers to falsify country-of-origin labels, undervaluing goods, or “assembling” products out of China where tariffs are lower. They’re creating shell companies in more tariff-friendly countries and even going so far as forging certificates of origin (thanks ChatGPT!) and otherwise falsifying shipping documentation in collusion with, or independently from, their suppliers.I get it. Whether you’re a supporter or not of the administration’s tariff policies, you’re still likely fed up with Donald Trump’s almost daily changes of his mind, the court cases, the lack of process, the chaos, the Tweets (sorry Xs, no, wait Truths).It’s not as if businesses don’t do this stuff all the time. For thousands of years, butchers have been putting their fingers on the scale; middlemen pocketed a few stolen pennies or denarii or drachmas behind their customers’ backs. I have clients who regularly undervalue (or even hide) their inventory, keep two sets of books, fail to report cash receipts, run their personal expenses through their companies. The list goes on.But none of this is a great idea.As a certified public accountant, I have a professional obligation to not only point this kind of behavior out to my clients but to disengage from providing services to those who are breaking the law, or at the very least demonstrating a significant lack of ethics. I warn them about the downsides: the penalties, the fines, the potential jail time for criminal behavior. I try to make them understand that behaving this way risks ruining relationships with suppliers, customers, partners and employees. If caught it’s both professionally and personally humiliating and not the kind of PR that will benefit your company. And it definitely upsets those in the community who are doing their best to abide by the law.And when it comes to tariffs, there are other – legal – ways to either avoid or reduce their impact on your business. You could use bonded or free trade zone warehouses. You could raise prices, cut other costs, invest in technologies. You can use new resources from theSmall Business Administrationto find domestic suppliers or lean into organizations like theWorld Trade Center Associationto find alternate suppliers in more tariff-friendly locales.And yet, I know – and read – of a not-insignificant number of business people who insist on just skirting the law. Why? It’s down to risk. Every decision one makes when running a business – or living your life – involves a risk/reward analysis.Rolling out a new product? It’s possible no one buys it. Investing in a piece of property? Getting on an airplane? Crossing the street? We all take risks every day because we want the rewards. Some people have a higher tolerance for this stuff. Those are the ones playing the tariff lottery, risking that their number won’t get picked.The business people I know who are willing to take these risks – even if they’re on dubious legal grounds – all have a reason to back up their actions. Maybe they were “completely ignorant, innocent or naïve” about the law. Or they come up with some legal explanation for their actions, regardless of how flimsy or far-fetched. Some of them have no problem throwing their supplier or employee or customer under the bus and then sleeping like a baby that night. They don’t just hope that no one finds out. They have a story to tell.Personally, this is not for me. I’m not a big risk taker. And, like most people, I’m a pretty bad liar.Explore more on these topicsUS small businessOpinionTrump tariffsTariffsDonald TrumpChinaAsia PacificcommentShareReuse this content"

Trump’s crude but effective rhetorical standbyChris TaylorThe president has spent the past decade employing a familiar tactic. Accusing protesters of ‘insurrection’ is just the latest exampleSun 15 Jun 2025 09.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 15 Jun 2025 14.14 EDTShareDonald Trump and his allies wasted little time in branding the people protesting against immigration enforcement raids in Los Angeles as “insurrectionists”.Stephen Miller, the White House deputy chief of staff for policy – particularly the vindictive kind – spoke darkly of a “violent insurrection”. JD Vance, the vice-president, inveighed against “insurrectionists carrying foreign flags” on the streets of the nation’s second-biggest city.It didn’t escape notice that an insurrection was exactly what the president was accused of instigating on 6 January 2021, when the flag being paraded through the Capitol was that of the Confederate secessionists. And that Trump hadn’t shown quite the same enthusiasm for sending in the troops then.But simply accusing the leader of the Maga movement of hypocrisy feels like such a 2015 move. It barely registers as news these days.What’s really notable is that this is the latest example of Trump’s well-honed tactic of repurposing criticisms of himself to attack his enemies.The world was first introduced to this manoeuvre on 19 October 2016 during a presidential debate in Las Vegas. When Hillary Clinton accused Trump of being Vladimir Putin’s puppet, Trump shot back: “No puppet, no puppet … No, you’re the puppet.”To many it sounded infantile, more proof of Trump’s lack of seriousness as a candidate. Back then, Twitter was the go-to platform to register reaction, asCBS reported:“‘NO, YOU’RE THE PUPPET!’ A presidential candidate just went straight up preschool on his opponent,” one person tweeted.“‘NO YOU’RE THE PUPPET’ shows how truly childish our election system has become,” someone replied.True, but these reactions underestimated the power of this simple, some would say puerile, tactic. After all, this was a time when the term “fake news” was still used in its original sense of fringe media stories that were deliberately untrue before Trump restyled it into a catch-all term for the mainstream media and anything it produces that he doesn’t like.The fact that people are now less likely to associate “fake news” withPizzagatethan withTrump’s attacks on the likes of CNNshows just how effective this switcheroo is.But its real power lies in the way it undermines the very notion of truth. If everyone’s an insurrectionist, no one is. As withHumpty Dumpty, words mean what Trump wants them to mean.The more you look, the more you see the tactic everywhere. It’s a pretty safe bet the phrase “election interference” had never tripped off Trump’s tongue before 2016, when the question of Russia’s role in helping secure his election ultimately led to theMueller report. After he waschargedwith election interference following the 2020 vote, however, he accused, among others, theBiden administration, theSecret Service, Google, the BritishLabour partyandKamala Harris(on the – entirely false – grounds she had posted AI-created images of her rallies) of “election interference” in the 2024 contest.When Democrats accused Trump of trying to “weaponize” the Department of Justice in his attempts to illicitly stay in office after his 2020 election defeat, it was only a question of time before “weaponization” would re-emerge, rotated 180 degrees, as a favourite term in the Maga lexicon of vitriol. Once Republicans regained control of the House of Representatives in 2023, it was they who set up a formalsubcommittee on “weaponization” of the federal government, to castigate their enemies. And when the Trump 2.0 administration weaponized the federal government tofire justice department officialswho had participated in Jack Smith’s “election interference” case against Trump on the grounds that they had weaponized the government … we had truly stepped through the looking glass.Accusing anti-racist campaigners of racism?Check. Denouncing Jews as antisemites?Check.And it’s all helped by another apparently childish but startlingly effective tactic: repetition. Why did amajority of Republicansin 2024 believe that Biden’s election victory four years earlier was rigged despite all evidence to the contrary? Probably because Trump spent fours years, day after day, saying it was. Why didso many Americansin the 2024 election campaign insist they had been better off four years earlier despite the demonstrable fact that Covid-hit 2020 had been an economic disaster? Well, maybe Trump’s constant bragging about presiding over the “greatest economy in the history of the world” had more than a little method to it. (As the musicianMark E Smith saidin another context: “It’s not repetition; it’s discipline.” You can say that again.)Trump’s rhetorical tropes may display a certain reptilian genius but there is nothing new under the sun.“The English follow the principle that when one lies, one should lie big, and stick to it. They keep up their lies, even at the risk of looking ridiculous.” So claimed a 1941 article calledChurchill’s Lie Factorywritten by one Joseph Goebbels, who had been accused of … exactly that.Chris Taylor is a subeditor at the Guardian US and author ofThe Black Carib Wars: Freedom, Survival, and the Making of the GarifunaExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionUS politicsLos Angeles Ice protestsUS Capitol attackcommentShareReuse this content"

This is a war Israel chose. It could have been prevented. Diplomatic talks were ongoing when the bombers took off for Iran. Israel’s continuing, illegal, unjustified airstrikes are unlikely to achieve their stated aim – permanently ending Tehran’s presumed efforts to build nuclear weapons – and may accelerate it. They must stop now. Likewise, Iran must halt its retaliation immediately and drop itsescalatory threats to attack US and UK bases.This conflict is not limited, as was the case last year, to tit-for-tat exchanges and “precision strikes” on a narrow range of military targets. It’s reached a wholly different level. Potentially nothing is off the table.Civilians are being killedon both sides. Leaders are targets. The rhetoric is out of control. With Israel fighting on several fronts, and Iran’s battered regime backed against a wall, the Middle East is closer than ever to a disastrous conflagration.Reasons can always be found to go to war. The roots of major conflicts often reach back decades – and this is true of the Israel-Iran vendetta, which dates to the 1979 Islamic revolution. The so-called “shadow war” between the twointensified in recent years. Yet all-out conflict had been avoided, until now. So who is principally to blame for this sudden, unprecedented explosion?Answer: three angry old men whose behaviour raises serious doubts about their judgment, common sense, motives and even their sanity.The fact that one of them – Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel’s prime minister – has actively sought a showdown with Iran for years does not mean it had to happen. The fact the Tehran regime is unusually vulnerable after Israel’s attacks last year and the defeat of its Hezbollah ally does not somehow legitimise a surprise assault on its sovereign soil. It’s true that UN nuclear inspectorssay Iran is breaking treaty obligations. But that doesn’t amount to a green light for war.Netanyahu attacked Iran to avert an ‘existential threat’. He may have made it worse | Jonathan FreedlandRead moreNetanyahu, 75, is unfit to lead Israel, let alone make life-or-death decisions on its behalf. He failed to protect Israelis from the 2023 terror attacks,then dodged responsibility. He has failed to fulfil his vow to destroy Hamas and bring back the hostages, yet his soldiers have killed more than55,000 Palestinians in Gazain the process. Heinvaded LebanonandSyria. Now it’s Iran. Where will he stop? Will he fight Turkey next? It’s not out of the question.War is Netanyahu’s choice. It’s whatgets him out of bed in the morning. It’s what keeps him and hisUK-sanctioned far-right croniesin office and out of jail. His actions have inflicted extraordinary damage on his country’s reputation, fuelling antisemitism globally. He claims Israel is fighting for its existence – but his own political survivalis a prime consideration, too. Netanyahu has beenindicted for alleged war crimes in Gaza. He should be arrested, not defended and enabled, before any more crimes are committed.Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran’s bellicose supreme leader, is the second leading culprit. He should have been put out to grass in Qom years ago. The 86-year-old squats atop a repressive, corrupt theocratic regime that has lost touch with the society and people it ostensibly serves. Elections are fixed, judges are bent, media censorship is pervasive. The regime’s military incompetence, economic mismanagement and brutal persecution of young women, gay men andhuman rights defenders such as Nasrin Sotoudehare notorious.Like Netanyahu, Khamenei is backed by hardline conservatives and opposed by reformers, but it’s him who calls the shots. His suspiciousinsistence on stepping up uranium enrichment, even though civil applications are lacking, ultimately gave Netanyahu an opening. Although he is said to be unwell, Khamenei is a key reason why Iranwill not abandon its nuclear programme. Even without him, Netanyahu’s idea that it can be totally eliminated is fantasy.This blindspotmay be the regime’s final undoing. Israel’s strikes have killed senior military leaders and damaged nuclear facilities and ballistic missile and drone forces. Khamenei himself, and Iran’s vital energy exports, may be next. Ina patronising video, Netanyahu urged Iranians to rise up and seize their “freedom”. Many would like to. The difficulty with such advice, coming from a tainted source, is that it could have the opposite effect of rallying the public, and Arab leaders, around the regime.Iran’sthreats to attack US, British and French basesand ships if they help defend Israel, and toclose the strait of Hormuz, heighten the risk of full-scale war and a global energy shock that could hurt the west and benefit Russia. These are some of the direct consequences of Donald Trump’s weak, vacillating stance.Trump, 79, is the third man in this avoidable tragedy. He previously said he preferred tonegotiate a new nuclear dealwith Iran, havingidiotically trashed the previous one. But he couldn’t decide on terms, and his amateurish negotiators kept changing their position. That was partly because Trump, as with Palestine and Ukraine, is too idle to study the details. He wings it instead, trusting to instincts that are invariably bad. That makes him easy prey for wily operators such as Netanyahu.Trump’s feeble ineptitude meant that when Israel’s leader insisted last week that the time was right for an all-out attack on Iran, he folded. Typically, once the attack began, he switched,trying to claim creditand issuing flatulent threats of his own. Each time he opens his mouth, Trump inadvertently confirms Iran’s suspicions that the US and Israel are acting in close concert.An urgent message for Keir Starmer: anyone who still thinks Trump has even the remotest idea what he’s doing when confronting the big international questions of the day should study the alarming events of the past week. Whether he is selling out to Vladimir Putin, weaponising tariffs, botching a Gaza ceasefire or bullying neighbours,Trump is a total menace. Far better, and safer, for Britain to bypass him and try as much as possible to act independently of the US from now on.These angry old men could get us all killed.Simon Tisdall is a Guardian foreign affairs commentatorExplore more on these topicsIsraelOpinionIranBenjamin NetanyahuDonald TrumpAyatollah Ali KhameneiIran's nuclear programmeIran nuclear dealcommentShareReuse this content"

But there are still reasons to hopeSun 15 Jun 2025 07.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 15 Jun 2025 16.38 EDTShareLike so many others, I watched the video of Rümeysa Öztürk, a Turkish student at Tufts University, as she was surrounded by men dressed in black, some wearing masks. They carried guns. One grabbed her by the collar. The men surrounded her, and one handcuffed her. You can hear her short shrieks of fear.She must have been terrified. I know I was when, as a 19-year-old student, I was kidnapped off the streets of Buenos Aires by members of an irregular taskforce. I know what it feels like and I know what it portends.My kidnapping occurred in 1977. One year earlier, I was in bed when my mother came to my door with a portable radio broadcasting a military march. Later, I saw tanks rolling down the streets. It was the saddest thing I’d ever seen. An authoritarian military junta had overthrown the government. Its mission, it said, was to restore order – just as, in the US today, the theme offered for public consumption is one of restoration, taking us back to a supposedly better time.In those years, the Argentine state became a terrorist: it chose the systematic violation of rights to supposedly protect a society with western, Christian values from leftist and communist “terrorists”.I and my fellow activists were not terrorists. We were leafleting, attending rallies, painting walls with our slogans. I had joined a group of like-minded idealists. But the government sought to neutralize us: if we weren’t going to go away, we would be “disappeared” – as I was, and as Öztürk was supposed to be. The authoritarian government targeted not only dissidents, but the media, the legal establishment and the intellectual elites, especially those who taught at universities, which were denounced as hotbeds of leftist thought.Condemnations byDonald Trumpecho almost verbatim. To an authoritarian regime, dissent is a threat. Now, in the US, it is foreigners being cast as enemies of the state. Öztürk’s apparent infraction was that she was a foreign student who co-wrote an op-ed in her student newspaper denouncing Israeli military action in Gaza as a “genocide.”Like Öztürk, I was treated as an enemy of the state. I became one of thedisappeared.In Argentina, the institutional checks on power were systematically destroyed. The legislature was abolished, the judiciary cowed or co-opted. In the US, Republican majorities in the legislature have voluntarily given up their independence, but the result is the same. The chief executive acts with impunity. Having tamed the legislative branch, Trump has moved on to the judiciary. He demands loyalty, denounces “activist” judges and calls for their impeachment. Judges and their family members have been doxed, their images and personal information circulated online. In April, the Judicial Conference of the United States officially requested anincrease in funding for security.In this climate, judges have and must continue to uphold the rule of law even as they do so at great personal risk. After a six week ordeal, Öztürk was finally released by order of a brave federal court judge. She has been returned to her community and upon her releaseshe stated: “I have faith in the American system of justice.” For this system to continue, judges must be protected.This small victory is just a beginning; so many others remain incarcerated. It took nearly two years to secure my release and even then, it was not through the power of the courts. During those years, the Argentine military acted with omnipotence and impunity. They were convinced that they would never be brought to justice for their crimes, because no one ever had been before.But with the return of democracy, the constitutional government took the members of the juntas to trial and I was called to testify. It was a historic moment, and a collective catharsis for the victims. Several of the former commanders in chief received severe sentences. Government accountability inArgentinabegan only after the fall of the regime. During the reign of the junta, there had been a total collapse of the judiciary.Forty years have passed since then, and under the government of Javier Milei, the Argentine state vindicates the dictatorship and justifies state terrorism. Still, the courts in Argentina today are a critical bulwark against a return to the horrors of the past. In the US, too, the courts are critical to prevent a descent into totalitarian horrors. In the camp in which I spent most of my time in captivity, 90% of the prisoners were murdered by being thrown out of a plane, alive. (I spent 20 years of my life bringing the pilots of those planes to justice.)In the 1980s, after I was kept as adesaparecidain two clandestine detention centers, enduring torture during my captivity, I found refuge in New York. It was there that I was able to pronounce the word “disappeared” for the first time and to denounce the horrors still being denied by the military junta without looking at the door of my house in terror, waiting for armed men to burst in to kidnap me. I worked in the office of an immigration attorney as an interpreter and paralegal and was in contact with migrants from all over the world who arrived in search of tranquility and freedom.Some had fled their countries for their lives, like me. I had a special empathy with them, and I found it repulsive to hear they were labeled “illegal”. I listened to stories of immigration service operations in factories or on public roads and received distressing calls in the office from relatives who did not know what had happened to their family members. They reminded me of the desperation of the Mothers of Plaza de Mayo, who were unsuccessfully searching for their loved ones in Argentina. Today, I still have blood ties to the US. And I am fearful for the country. I have seen how autocracy begins and I see signs of it everywhere.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFighting BackFree newsletterBig thinkers on what we can do to protect civil liberties and fundamental freedoms in a Trump presidency.

How could honest citizens halt cruelty? Is it feasible to hold accountable government officials who violate basic rights?Immigrants being sent to detention facilities abroad, the White House considering suspending habeas corpus, the repression of protests by the military in the streets of LA – all are serious threats to US democracy. But resistance in other cities and lawsuits filed to block deployment of troops seem to be a shield against the prevalence of these authoritarian measures. Responsible and accurate independent media coverage both in the country and abroad, the creation and strengthening of civil rights advocacy organizations such as the Mothers of Plaza de Mayo, and proposals to include basic human rights protections in the US constitution, as done in post-dictatorial Argentina in 1994, could be a way of ensuring freedom for upcoming generations.What gives me hope are the expressions of individual and collective rebellion, both in the US and Argentina. Judges who make decisions that question and even penalize the abuses of political power are necessary. But judges cannot uphold our democracy on their own.We need members of Congress who vote against dangerous reforms and budget cuts; human rights organizations that make institutional violence visible; journalists who – at the risk of losing their jobs – communicate the truth; and broad collective action of ordinary citizens who through their demonstrations repudiate the government and take to the streets to show that the flame of freedom is still alive. We must raise our voices against authoritarianism. It is our moral duty to overcome the reign of fear. Immigrants and dissidents are on the frontline. Judges are a critical backstop. We must work to protect them all.Miriam Lewin is a leading Argentine journalist and survivor of the dictatorship.

But what does it really mean, and what can it teach us?Sun 15 Jun 2025 11.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 15 Jun 2025 19.30 EDTShareIstill remember the day I left Germany for good. Four incredible years in the heart of Europe were behind me, and ahead of me was a return to Afghanistan – a country I never stopped loving, even from afar. But what should have felt like going home came with a weight of uncertainty.I went back with hope. Real hope. Afghanistan, despite all its scars, was buzzing with young energy. More than two-thirds of the population is under 25. You could feel the hunger for change in the air – in the packed classrooms, in the cafes full of debate, in the crowded markets thick with the smell of naan and kebabs. There were snow-capped mountains and sunlit orchards but also a fragile kind of optimism holding everything together.Faced with the toughest two years of my life, I turned to Islam to give me strength and patience | Shadi Khan SaifRead moreAnd then, it collapsed.The Taliban returned. The dream didn’t just crack – it shattered. I fled again. This time to Australia. Not just with a backpack but with heartbreak, questions and a strange, lingering word echoing in my mind:naseeb.In Muslim communities,naseebis a word people often say when things don’t go to plan. A job you didn’t get. A wedding that never happened. A flight missed, or a prayer unanswered.“It wasn’t your naseeb,”people say, as if to help you let go.But what does it really mean?In today’s world – where we glorify hustle, control, five-year plans and endless optimisation –naseebalmost sounds too passive. But it’s not about giving up. Not really. In Islamic thinking,naseebis the paradox of action and surrender. You do your part – fully, fiercely – but you also understand that you’re not the only one writing the story.It’s a kind of faith that says: work like it depends on you. Pray like it is absolutely out of your control. And then … let go.It’s a kind of faith that says: work like it depends on you. Pray like it is absolutely out of your control. And then … let goIf I’ve learned anything from watching Afghanistan’s story unfold, it’s that you can’t always steer the ship. This country has seen it all – modern monarchs, Marxist revolutions, a brief democratic experiment, and now a return to religious rule. Every shift came with promises and every one of them left behind disappointment. For many Afghans,naseebisn’t just a saying. It’s how they keep going. A way of surviving what they cannot change.And somehow, within that, there’s strength.There’s a verse in the Qur’an that often plays in my mind:“Perhaps you dislike a thing and it is good for you; and perhaps you love a thing and it is bad for you. Allah knows, and you do not know.”(Surah Al-Baqarah 2:216.)That line has helped me through displacement, heartbreak and uncertainty. It reminds me that even when everything falls apart, the effort still matters. The fight still meant something.Rumi, the Afghan-born poet so many of us turn to for wisdom, put it in a way only he could:“Try not to resist the changes that come your way. Instead, let life live through you.”In that sense,naseebisn’t a chain – it’s a kind of freedom. A way to stay grounded when the world refuses to make sense.Ramadan is not just about abstaining from food. It’s about truthfulness – something we can all learn from | Shadi Khan SaifRead moreJust this morning, sipping coffee on a chilly Melbourne day, I scrolled through Instagram and saw Bollywood director Karan Johar talking about it.“There are a million people more talented than me,”he said.“But they might not have been this successful. We are born with a naseeb – something marked in our palm lines and on our forehead.”He wasn’t saying don’t work hard. Quite the opposite. His point was: talent and hustle matter – but they’re not the whole story.And it’s not just an Islamic idea. In Judaism, there’sbashert– destined fate, especially in relationships. Christianity says,“In their hearts humans plan their course, but the Lord establishes their steps.”(Proverbs 16:9.) Hinduism teaches karma and divine timing. Buddhism urges us to act but not cling to outcomes. Across the board, it seems like all these traditions are hinting at the same truth: do your best but don’t expect to control everything.That’s a radical idea in today’s grind culture. Because society says: if you don’t succeed, it’s on you. You didn’t want it enough. You didn’t work hard enough. That belief can be crushing.Butnaseeboffers a softer, truer alternative: effort matters – but so does grace.Now, living far from the place that raised me – and the place that broke me – I still wrestle with the “what-ifs”. But I’m learning to live with them. To trust that my journey, full of delays and detours, is not wrong.

It was ludicrous, condescending, half-baked, opportunistic and plain stupid. Evenhedidn’t seem to know exactly what he wanted. At a Reform UK press conference in Port Talbot, he seemed tomake the casefor reopening the town’s steel-making blast furnaces, before admitting that “it might be easier to build a new one”, though he also acknowledged that it would “cost in the low billions” to do so. But he had even more dizzying visions of reopened Welsh mines. “If you offer people well-paying jobs … many will take them,” said Farage, “even though you have to accept that mining is dangerous.”The climate crisis, predictably enough, was not worth considering. He also did not offer any opinions about coal-related issues such asslag heaps, land slips, rivers that run black, and unimaginableunderground disasters. When he was asked where new pits might be located, he blithely offered the opinion that it “comes down to geology”. That is true, up to a point, but he would surely also have to think about thehousing developmentsandbusiness parksthat often sit atop all those disused coal seams.The whole thing was – of course – politics on the level of pub bullshit, but Farage and his people presumably knew that. What mattered was the resulting spectacle: Britain’s foremost populist proposing to “reindustrialise” Wales, in the face of entirely reasonable doubts, mockery and outright opposition from voices easily maligned as the usual distant elites. In that sense the visit was a win, repeating a formula that has been working for a very long time.Besides Farage’s own enviable political skills, there are obvious reasons for that. The first is to do with the fact that the basic social and economic conditions that fed into the rise of the UK Independence party and the Brexit referendum remain unchanged. It seems, in fact, to be 2016 for ever: Britain is still a country of anaemic growth and productivity, ongoing local austerity, stagnant wages and fear of the future. Those conditions explain people’s ever-deepening disdain for mainstream politicians, and their sense that as life constantly goes round in circles, Westminster does not seem able or willing to break the pattern.Every grim rotation, moreover, seems to be accompanied by ever-more extreme manifestations of the country’s dysfunctionality. Our passage to a new political era used to be marked by the results of elections and referendums. But of late, it feels as if more vivid proof of where we are heading is provided by civil disturbances. Last year’s summer riots were an obvious example. In the same week that saw massedviolence in Salford, we have just seen horrific outbreaks ofracist violencein Northern Ireland, and Farage hasoffered opinionsthat follow his usual slippery script: “I just wonder whether it is not a deeper, broader problem we saw something of after Southport last year. You know what? If they’d listened to me, none of this would have happened.”A question not asked enough in political journalism is what life in contemporary Britainfeelslike. The answer in part comes down to a profound sense of tension and a constant, latent fear that something awful is about to happen. Farage attracts supporters by offering himself as an answer to that feeling – but to those who recoil from him, he is the source of it. Like Donald Trump, that combination makes him a very zeitgeisty politician.Why does Nigel Farage get to play British politics on easy mode? | Andy BeckettRead moreSo does his presence on social media – which, even if most politicians do not yet understand it, has changed what is required to be a successful public figure even more radically than TV once did. Farage has 1.3 million TikTok followers, as many asevery other Westminster politiciancombined. Particularly since Elon Musk turned Twitter into X, he is regularly cited and praised in the parallel news universe that millions of people now take their information from – full of scurrilous rumours and explanations for events rooted in QAnon-like conspiracies. That ecosystem blurs into the nightmarish version of reality X offers as a kind of mood music, represented by endless videos of violence and hostile altercations between members of the public. All this suits Farage – and Farage-ism – just fine.His key asset is a diagnosis of people’s problems that gets simpler and sharper by the week: you are scared and struggling, he and his allies tell the public, because the government spends too much money on foreigners and is full of privileged and snobby people who know nothing of your pain. The Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham recentlygave an interviewto the centre-left journal Renewal, in which he mused on what effective political communication now entails. The governments led by Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, he said, operated in “a world of nuance”, but social media “just ended all of that”. What he said next sounded like a brisk answer to why Farage is winning: our modern means of communication, he said, “changed politics, and politics hasn’t changed enough to reflect that … people want instant opinions from elected representatives. They want authentic opinions”.Six weeks ago I watched Farage do a walkabout in a neighbourhood of Scunthorpe, surrounded by crowds of people jostling to take pictures of him on their phones. Not long after he had been presented with an Airfix tank, he commented that all the attention was “the benefit of just being real, you know what I mean?” Clearly, just like Boris Johnson in his pomp, a great deal ofhis persona– the clothes, the pints, every calculated pronouncement – is actually affectation and pretence. But politics is now so low on charisma and the common touch that simply being comfortable in your own skin looks like a kind of spectacular normality.Wales needs a green future, not Nigel Farage’s coalmine fantasy | LettersRead moreIn that sense, Starmer and Labour’s other high-ups might be Farage’s ideal adversaries. With the possible exception of Angela Rayner, they are mostly bloodless and hesitant. They cling on to a presentational style that is 20 years out of date, built around pre-ordained news themes on theproverbial “grid”, set-piece interviews, and complicated and chronically abstract rhetoric: “missions”, “renewal”, the constant chase for growth. Of late, the prime minister has tried his own occasional approximations of Farage’s approach,putting upsuch blunt and boastful online posts as: “I’ve already returned over 24,000 people with no right to be here. And I won’t stop there.” But that style rings hollow, because he doesn’t have Farage’s swaggering confidence nor any understanding of how to bring such directness to the way he talks about Labour’s fundamentals: the economy, jobs, public services.There is also something to be said about how the government intends to change the country. After a wasted year, last week’s spending review contained a surprising amount of good news, not least on housing. But it was all about the kind of investment that will not start to become visible until 2028 or 2029. Everyday life, it seems, will continue moving in ever-decreasing circles for another three or four years. That is a long time for Farage to carry on making mischief, as he illustrates an aspect of modern Britain too little understood – that, to an extent that vividly illustrates other people’s colossal failures, he looks like the only front-rank figure who understands how 21st-century politics actually works.John Harris is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Contemporary culture often portrays young boys as the victims of a new social order that gives them no blueprint for how to be a man in the 21st century. At worst, we see them as disciples of misogynists such as Andrew Tate, as perpetrators of violence, or as victims of divisive, rightwing ideologies.It can seem as though young men are inevitably bound to be radicalised. More than half of gen-Z men in the US aged between 18 and 29voted for Donald Trump. As Southgate put it in his lecture, more of our sons than we could possibly realise are beholden to “callous toxic influencers”, including Tate.In recent research we commissioned at St Dunstan’s Education Group, the group of private schools that I lead, we found that nearly half (49%) of 18 to 25-year-old men felt there were very few strong male role models in society, while 17% of young men said that credible accusations of sexual assault wouldnotchange their perception of someone they considered a role model. More than half (59%) of young men felt that feminism had gone too far.Although it’s clear that boys are failing to understand their place in the world and are misguidedlyblaming feminismand broader advances in women’s rights for their perceived irrelevance, this is far from inevitable. While our instinct might be to judge young men, we need to unpick the context in which they grow up. As the youngest generation of men retreat online, they have moved away from traditional concepts of what makes a person admirable. Real-life role models have been eclipsed by an unregulated online world that capitalises on teenage uncertainty and presents viewers with misrepresentations of sex, body image and success.In my years as a teacher, I have seen how the curriculum can help to support people through these challenges. Carving out meaningful time to work with young people and have discussions about their identity, purpose and choices is invaluable. Unpicking the positive attributes of masculinity and feminist thinking helps students understand the complexity of these topics. At our school in south-east London, we introduced courses that examine identity and online spaces, pornography addiction, toxic representations of gender and online influencers. We felt it was important to create time for young people to sit together and talk through these issues.Teaching these subjects requires sensitivity, careful consideration and meaningful time. Although relationships and sex education (RSE) is compulsory in all secondary schools, it is often shoehorned into odd corners of the curriculum and tutor time. This fragmented approach limits its impact, particularly when it is delivered by undertrained, non-specialist teachers. Despite the urgency of issues like consent, online safety and gender identity, time devoted to exploring these topics remains far too short. The PSHE Association (the national body for PSHE education) recommends at least one hour per week across all key stages, but this is rarely guaranteed and, in many state schools, PSHE receives far less attention than other subjects.To address this, reform must extend beyond well-resourced independent schools. Over 90% of children in the UK are educated in the state sector, where schools face stricter timetable constraints and less curricular flexibility. A society-wide issue demands a society-wide solution, which should be led by the government and the Department for Education. National policy should establish clearer expectations, including protected curriculum time, dedicated teacher training and financial support. Only then can we ensure that every child, regardless of background, receives the education they need to navigate relationships, identity and the modern world with resilience and understanding.Adolescence: what teen boys really think of girls, influencers and porn – podcastRead moreYet curriculum reform is only one part of the solution. As the father of two young children and as an educator, I was particularly reassured by other statistics from our research: for the majority (50%) of young men, their biggest role model is still their father, while a fifth (20%) chose a male teacher as the second most significant person in their life.It’s easy to despair at what the future may hold for the next generation, but there is something deeply reassuring that those closest to young people still have real influence on them and the power to provide an antidote to misogynistic influencers.Putting down our phones, being present, playing with our children, going for walks, talking to them about choices and values, offering support when needed: all of this can be just as potent as any online narrative, if not more so. When young people turn to online spaces, what they’re looking for is guidance, and if we can offer that in an alternative, positive and reinforcing way we can begin to counteract the harmful language and stereotypes that flourish there.As educators and as individuals, we have the ability to stand up to this challenge. We can reshape young people’s understanding of not just masculinity, but gender, relationships, sexuality and our values as a society. In my professional and personal life I have witnessed the value of speaking to young people in the language they recognise, even about topics they may find particularly difficult or confusing. The challenge is great, but together we have the tools to rise to it.Nick Hewlett is chief executive of the St Dunstan’s Education Group, a network of private schools in south-east LondonDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

And who wants to cook or plan with a toddler in tow anyway?Sun 15 Jun 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 15 Jun 2025 16.33 EDTShareNext week, I’m going on an all-inclusive holiday to Greece. All-inclusives have a famously bad rep for all-day boozing, and in certain quarters there is a sniffiness about their supposed chips with everything, Brits abroad vibe. For some people, the idea of being confined to a hotel, even one with a beautiful beach attached, sounds awful. But, like many parents, I’ve become a convert.How did I get here? I think it was always on the cards. When I was small, holiday brochures were my bibles. I’d spend hours perusing them and comparing the hotels: their azure pools framed by water slides undulating in spaghetti-like nests, their private white-sand beaches with lines of striped parasols, and these things called “kids’ clubs”, which offered all kinds of fun activities and, most excitingly, a disco.All-inclusives were big in the 90s, at least in my small Welsh community. International travel had become more accessible to working-class families, and they were flocking to Spain and Greece. My classmates would return bronzed, with portions of their hair wrapped in silken, coloured threads of embroidery, their talk of “tapas” and “pesetas” sounding impossibly glamorous. They knew all the big hits before they hit British shores – Saturday Night, Macarena – and the dances to match. I would feel wild with jealousy.We had never been able to afford an all-inclusive, but in my mid-teens I went on a couple of package deals and had the best time: finally, I got to swim in a sea so clear you could see the bottom! I did karaoke and went parasailing and – despite a teenage pregnancy scare that hung over a mother-daughter trip to Zakynthos until I finally, jubilantly got my period on a tour boat to Navagio beach – I fell desperately in love with Greece.I didn’t really realise there was a snobbery about package holidays until I started university and met people who had grown up with second homes or who took expensive gap years, prattling on about all the remote places they had seen, how they’d slummed it in a beach shack (before recuperating in a five-star hotel, of course). I guess I bought into it to an extent, because I spent my 20s trying to get to the most remote and underpopulated Greek islands possible.The one all-inclusive I experienced at that time was in Cuba, as it was the only accommodation available near a particular beach. It was full of Canadians who had brought their own drinking receptacles because the hotel’s plastic cups didn’t hold enough piña colada. To quote The Lazy River, Zadie Smith’s all-inclusive-set short story, they were drinking “so much alcohol that your accommodation is effectively free”. One night, the “entertainment” was a monkey riding a donkey, though I could have been hallucinating because of all the rum.It was only when I became a parent that I fully appreciated the sheer joy of the all-inclusive. After my son was born prematurely, and in his first year needed some hospital treatment, I didn’t want to take him to a place where the only way out was a twice-weekly boat, where there was no doctor, or even a pharmacy. I had certainly become a more anxious traveller, but also I was knackered. I didn’t want to cook. I didn’t want to have to plan. I wanted a holiday, but I wanted it to be easy.This generation of parents is the most well-travelled in human history, their tastes have been refined, and I found that a lot of all-inclusives have upped their game. Ikos, especially, is now the word on a certain kind of British parent’s lips. With its gourmet cuisines (including gourmet baby food), creches following Ofsted guidelines and incredible service (they literally take your baby’s bottles away, sanitise them and bring them back to your room), its resorts are a world away from the sorts of all-inclusives I lusted after as a child. We were only ever able to holiday with them once, in Halkidiki, thanks to my selling my novel, getting a really good deal on the trip, having a child under two and booking at a time when it was more likely to rain (which it did) – but we were the most relaxed I think it’s possible to be on holiday with a baby, and if I ever get a windfall I will totally be back.If it takes a village to raise a child, it takes a youth hostel to give their parents a break | Nell FrizzellRead moreThankfully, you don’t have to pay those prices for a great all-inclusive experience. I love Grecotel, the more affordable Greek chain, because the mostly Mediterranean food is excellent and it’s very kid-friendly (last year, at their hotel on Corfu, my son got to experience a water slide for the first time, and it felt as if I had come full circle and achieved my childhood dreams). Part of the reason that I can’t stand snobbery about all-inclusive hotels is because lots of them are more and more accessible, not only to those with small children but to disabled people. In many places you can hire mobility scooters, wheelchairs and buggies.One of the reasons we didn’t travel much when I was growing up was because of my brother’s complex needs. It was a different world back then, a fact that hit me last year as I stood in the check-in queue at Corfu airport and noted big advertising screens proudly displaying their “Boarding pass for autism”. Suddenly, I was wiping away tears. On returning, I discovered that Tui is now advertising “neuro-inclusive” holidays. Some of its hotels now have sensory rooms, and its childcare staff are trained in special educational needs.These things matter to families. At a time when parents are stressed, skint, overworked and often isolated, an all-inclusive is a pressure-off option. Don’t knock it until you’ve tried it. Personally, I’d take one over a campsite in France any day.Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsFamily holidaysOpinionGreece holidaysEurope holidayscommentShareReuse this content"

Sure, they might not be the real thing – but they’re close enough.Tribute acts – the artists who make their living performing covers of well-known musicians – are not new. But in the past few years they’ve surged in popularity – even while Australia’s live music industryhas struggled– as audiences embrace nostalgia more than ever before. RSLs and regional towns might be the stomping ground for tribute acts but today the best in the business can charge more than $100 a ticket.So who are some of the biggest tribute acts in Australia, and what drives them? We meet four to find out.Bjorn Again: ‘I said, I don’t really like Abba’View image in fullscreenBjorn Again perform at Melbourne’s Sidney Myer Music Bowl in 2024.Photograph: Dara MunnisBjorn Again, the world’s biggestAbbatribute act, have played gigs most artists only ever dream of. They’ve done Glastonbury three times and graced hallowed venues such as Wembley Stadium and the Sydney Opera House. They perform 300 and 400 times a year, and have toured about 120 countries.But as co-founder John Tyrell sees it, the truest sign of the group’s success is the celebrites they attract.“Dave Grohl is our biggest fan,” he says. “Rowan Atkinson has booked us for his parties. JK Rowling’s been to a gig. Russell Crowe booked us for his wedding. We’ve played Money, Money, Money to Bill Gates at a Microsoft function in LA – I could just go on and on.”To meet the level of demand, Bjorn Again has more than one line-up on staff to play the Swedish superstars and it operates offices in London and Melbourne. Shows sell out quickly. As Tyrell puts it: “We could do a gig on the moon.”Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morningAmplified review – loving but uneven musical tribute to the Divinyls’ Chrissy AmphlettRead moreBut this global success story wasn’t born – or, ahem, Bjorn – out of a great love for Abba’s music. In 1988, Tyrell and his friend Rod Stephen were playing in bands around Melbourne. But when their bands failed to take off, Stephen had the idea for an Abba cover act: he thought it would be funny and something different from other gigs on the market – and a way to meet all the girls they’d have to audition.“I said, ‘I don’t really like Abba,’” Tyrell remembers. “And he said, ‘I don’t either, but that’s not the point.’”They couldn’t have imagined they’d still be doing it more than 35 years later. Tyrell stopped playing in the band 10 years ago and now works behind the scenes, but he still loves the job because “you just never know who will ring up wanting us for a gig”.View image in fullscreenBjorn Again performing in Sydney last year.Photograph: Dara MunnisA case in point is their most famous – or infamous – fan: Vladimir Putin, whobooked the group for a private showin Moscow in 2009. The gig was booked through their UK office, so Tyrell didn’t learn about it until after the fact – when he woke up to 80 missed calls from journalists.It was a different time in geopolitics then, he says. “I don’t think he had invaded anywhere [yet].” But recent events have somewhat soured that momentous booking: “Since the Ukraine thing, we’ve taken it off our website.”Despite Bjorn Again’s lucrative global success, Tyrell says it’s enjoyment of the job that keeps him going. “We are not driven by money,” he says. “We were just doing it for fun. But it’s been insanely successful.”The Dolly Show: ‘I studied her laugh on repeat over and over, just so I have it right’View image in fullscreenKelly O’Brien performing the Dolly Show. She plays between 75 and 100 gigs a yearKelly O’Brien admits she looks “nothing like Dolly Parton”. It’s true – out of costume, the only trace of the Australian-born, UK-based performer’s alter ego is her long acrylic nails. That, and her height – she’s exactly five feet, just like the real Dolly.But for the past 18 years, O’Brien has been doing a bang-up job of looking like Parton when she takes to the stage in The Dolly Show. It hasn’t come easy – as Parton once famously said, it takes a lot of money to look this cheap.When O’Brien first decided to become a Dolly Parton tribute act in 2007, she took out a £10,000 loan to buy “big prosthetic boobs”, wigs, makeup, nails, costumes and custom-made corsets. It takes two hours to doll up, and every show has six costume changes, which, done hastily on stage, are “like two pigs fighting under a blanket”. Off stage, O’Brien adheres to a strict ketogenic diet to stay as tiny as the real Parton.The commitment has paid off: O’Brien “now gets paid extremely well for what I do” and she was recently chosen by the real Dolly Parton to beone of 15 finalists in contention to play the singerin a Broadway show about her life.O’Brien’s road to Dolly began many years ago. A gifted singer, by age 12 she had begun entering country music competitions in her home state of South Australia. It wasn’t that she was particularly enamoured with the genre, she just liked the attention and the chance to win easy money. For one competition, she dressed up as Parton “and everyone lost their minds”, which sealed her future. She now plays between 75 and 100 gigs a year.But her costume wasn’t the only thing O’Brien had to master. When she started out, she spent three months studying every video of Parton she could find so she could convincingly imitate the star’s mannerisms. And the work is never done.“She’s written more than 3,000 songs – I’m always learning another one,” O’Brien says. “I’ve learned to play the guitar with these nails; the banjo, the harmonica, the tambourine. The stories, the anecdotes, the Dolly-isms, the way she moves … I studied her laugh on repeat over and over, just so I have it right. I want people to think when I’m on stage – as they do – that I’m her.”Her shows attract Dolly diehards of all kinds.As well as the paycheque, what keeps O’Brien coming back is the feedback she gets from audiences – such as the woman who told her she’d experienced a miscarriage, but listening to her performance of Light of a Clear Blue Morning made her feel, for the first time, that everything would be OK.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSaved for LaterFree newsletterCatch up on the fun stuff with Guardian Australia's culture and lifestyle rundown of pop culture, trends and tipsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The group performs six shows a week in Las Vegas and has four full line-ups, allowing them to play in different parts of the world at the same time. “We’ve franchised, if you like,” says Michael Clift, the man behind this very global operation.Clift and his bandmates came up with the idea to put a Bee Gees cover act together in 1996 to bring in extra money while they worked on original music. Back then, tribute acts were few and far between – and Bee Gees fans were “fairly standoffish”, unsure if Clift and co were mocking their beloved heroes.Before the internet, it was a lot harder to research the ins and outs of an act, or even see them perform. Clift would drive to record stores and secondhand shops around Melbourne to rustle together the band’s back catalogue.But he was determined. A great tribute act has to capture the essence of what fans love about an artist, he says – not just the music but the “finer details” of the group’s mannerisms, outfits and speech.“We went to huge lengths to look like the Bee Gees – prosthetic teeth, wigs, makeup, you name it,” Clift says. “To me, it was all about getting those details right. If you’re watching Kurt Russell playing Elvis, you don’t want to be thinking all night [if] it’s Kurt Russell you’re watching. You need to be able to suspend your disbelief.”It took a lot of work and time, but “it definitely paid off”, Clift says. They convinced a Vegas casino to give them a residency and 14 years later proudly count themselves as part of what they estimate is the 5% of tribute acts who work full-time.But despite Clift’s success, the most dangerous thing a tribute act can do is get comfortable, he says: “We’ve been doing it for nearly 30 years. But a new [act] could pop up tomorrow that’s beautifully produced and full of talented people. You don’t have any rights, you’re playing someone else’s music … so if someone else starts doing it better, you have to let it go.”The Australian Bee Gees Showis touring the US and Australia this yearDreams: ‘People were like, are you sure you want to do that?’View image in fullscreenWayne Daniels and Annette Zavesa in Dreams, a Fleetwood Mac and Stevie Nicks tribute bandThere are at least sevenFleetwood Mactribute acts in Australia but Dreams, who ticked off 76 shows last calendar year, is perhaps the busiest.Behind the operation is Wayne Daniels, a longtime musician who founded the act in 2016. An old friend, who then managed a golf club, needed a show for Sunday afternoons at the venue and asked Daniels to find something to fill the slot. He slapped together a Fleetwood Mac cover show – and enjoyed the experience so much that he decided to keep doing it.“I knew there were quite a few other Fleetwood Mac cover bands around, but I really wanted to do it for myself because Rumours is in my blood,” he says, referring to one of the band’s most successful albums.Not everyone was convinced. “People were saying, ‘A lot of people are doing [Fleetwood Mac covers shows] – are you sure you want to do that? How popular can it be?” Daniels says, down the line from Redcliffe Entertainment Centre, where his band is getting ready to play to a sold-out crowd of 400. “And look where we are today.”Women have been key to the show’s success. They love Stevie Nicks and drive ticket sales. That’s why it’s crucial they have a performer on stage who looks like the real deal. Daniels, who serves as the group’s musical director but also steps into the role of Lindsey Buckingham, admits he looks nothing like the real Lindsey. “But that doesn’t matter – I can be the one who doesn’t look like him, because I started the band,” he says. “And in all honesty, when we’re performing, all eyes are on the girls.”Dreams Show now has its own fans, the most devoted of whom have seen the show “10 to 15 times”, Daniels says. “They come again and again and again, and they bring back their shirts for us to sign”. Not Fleetwood Mac shirts – Dreams Show shirts. (The band also sell hats and, because “we are in Australia”, stubby coolers.)Despite the number of Fleetwood Mac tribute acts out there, Daniels isn’t fazed by the competition. “Good luck to them,” he says. “Whatever keeps the music alive is a good thing.”The Dreams Fleetwood Mac and Stevie Nicks Showis playing around Australia for the rest of the yearExplore more on these topicsMusicAbbaDolly PartonBee GeesFleetwood MacAustralian musicfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The secret, says creator Kat Sadler: dealing with things in ‘the most unenlightened way possible’Sun 15 Jun 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 15 Jun 2025 05.02 EDTShareFew writers take criticism well, fewer actively court it. Kat Sadler, however, has an insatiable appetite for negative feedback. When crafting her BBC sitcom Such Brave Girls, the 31-year-old frequently runs the scripts past her younger sister and co-star Lizzie Davidson – but she isn’t looking for praise. Instead, “she wants you to tear it to pieces”, says Davidson. “She loves it.”“I get off on it,” confirms Sadler, with matter-of-fact melancholy.“You’re like: yeah, yeah, yeah,” says Davidson, mimicking her sister’s dismissive response to compliments. “Now tell me what you didn’t like about it.”Unfortunately, Sadler’s masochistic streak isn’t getting much gratification at the moment: where Such Brave Girls is concerned, complaints have been very thin on the ground. The first series of this vicious and relentlessly outrageous BBC sitcom – in which Sadler and Davidson play Josie and Billie, a pair of desperate, delusional, self-obsessed sisters tiptoeing around their perpetually furious mother – was met with a unanimously enthusiastic response from critics when it aired in the winter of 2023: a slew of award nominations followed; soon after, it won the Bafta for best scripted comedy.This was an exceptional achievement for two reasons. First, because the pair’s success seemed to come out of nowhere. Sadler had been a joke writer for hire onTV comedyentertainment shows (Mel Giedroyc: Unforgivable; Joe Lycett’s Got Your Back), while Davidson was an aspiring actor marooned in interactive children’s entertainment (a particular grim job at a Shrek-themed show attracted bratty kids who seemed to enjoy insulting the cast). Second, because Such Brave Girls was a product of extreme low points in both their lives: during lockdown, the sisters had a phone call in which Davidson confessed she had accrued £20k of debt and Sadler revealed she had been sectioned after trying to end her life twice.View image in fullscreenAll at sea … Kat Sadler and Lizzie Davidson in Such Brave Girls.Photograph: Vishal Shama/BBC/Various Artists LimitedMiraculously, the pair managed to see the funny side, and decided to channel their collective misery into a sitcom – keeping Sadler’s mental health issues for Josie, but transferring Davidson’s debt to their fictional mother, Deb. The result is a remorselessly hilarious show about depression, anxiety, sexuality, abandonment, dysfunctional relationships and poverty that never gets close to worthy, earnest dramedy; something you could probably predict from the very first episode, in which Deb orders Josie – who has been experiencing low moods and panic attacks – to cheer up as her “haunting presence” is negatively affecting Deb’s new boyfriend’s libido.I first spoke to the pair a couple of weeks before series one aired. At that point, the sisters (who have different surnames as Sadler is a stage name) were giddy with nerves, grappling with the surreal prospect of their semi-autobiographical sitcom being broadcast to the nation; each day Davidson would refresh the TV planner in the hope of glimpsing it in the schedules. We meet again in December 2024, on the set of series two. Since the show’s rapturous reception and Bafta win – an invitation to the British comedy firmament if ever there was one (past winners have included The Office, Peep Show, The Thick of It and Derry Girls) – I assume their lives have been transformed into a whirlwind of showbiz thrills. Have they?Josie is such a pure narcissist. She really believes she’s the main character – everything revolves round herKat Sadler“I wish they had,” says Sadler, eating lunch in a shabby makeshift green room during a brief break from filming. “You need to hear about the day we won the Bafta. It was just weird.” The pair got an Uber home from the ceremony, “and it was just like: well, back to our lives. I got up the next morning, went to the office and carried on writing.” Meanwhile, Davidson – a gifted comic actor – immediately went back to her job in a clothing shop. “And nobody said anything!” says Sadler, still astonished. “I didn’t even take my makeup off from the night before, I just turned up and was like: hey guys!” Davidson recalls. Having envisaged a victorious return to the shop floor, she was quickly brought back down to earth. “[My colleagues] were just like: the shoes are there,” Davidson sighs. She’s due to go back to her day job the month after we speak.The pair may not feel like superstars, but the Such Brave Girls set certainly has a buzz about it. Although the action is set in the West Sussex commuter town of Crawley, the show’s interior scenes are filmed in a defunct school on the outskirts of Liverpool, and the BBC’s director of comedy Jon Petrie and two other senior producers have also made the long journey north-west to check in on one of their hottest properties. Britcom giant Simon Bird, AKA Will from The Inbetweeners – who wrote Sadler a letter asking if he could work on the series after falling in love with the pilot – is once again in the director’s chair (in this case, one of the chintzy armchairs in the sisters’ fictional living room). I watch Sadler and Davidson perform a two-hander, which differs markedly from that day’s script; the pair alter and edit the words as they go along, sometimes for clarity, sometimes for extra laughs and sometimes just because someone forgot a couple of their lines.View image in fullscreenMother load … Louise Brealey (right) with Paul Bazely in Such Brave Girls.Photograph: James Stack/BBC/Various Artists LimitedIt is clear that Sadler is genuinely not precious about her dialogue; Bird also seems very relaxed about the on-camera brainstorming. “There’s lots of flexibility, but you also get that sense that Kat knows what it is,” says Sherlock’s Louise Brealey, who plays the sisters’ mother, Deb. “They’re guardians of their characters,” says Sadler, about the cast. “So often the thing they want to change is right. It will be something I haven’t noticed.” Brealey plays Deb as a fellow Northamptonshire native, so usually makes minor changes to the phrasing to suit her accent, which she amps up for the show. “You do an accent?” chips in Davidson, with mock confusion.Brealey rolls her eyes. “They tease me, this is a running joke.”“It’s so subtle,” continues Davidson, as the sisters descend into hysterics.“Get fucked,” says Brealey. “My real voice is posh!”It is hard to imagine Josie and Billie baiting Deb with such impunity: the Such Brave Girls matriarch is an extraordinarily cynical, appearance-obsessed woman on the verge, desperate to hang on to her man/meal ticket Dev (Benidorm’s Paul Bazely) and ready to brutally lay into her firstborn at a moment’s notice (her targets include Josie’s ketchup usage, depressive episodes, unshaven legs, round shoulders and androgynous dress sense). Is she going to be as horrible in series two? Sadler jumps to her defence: “I don’t think she’s horrible, I think she doesn’t mince her words.” Brealey isn’t so sure. Actors are meant to be eternally sympathetic to their characters, she says, but “I would say she’s pretty much a monster”.Brealey is clearly very different from Deb: effusive and extroverted, she sings loudly while having her makeup touched up and cringes as she recalls filling pauses in production by performing showtunes for the crew. Josie and Billie, on the other hand, began life as exaggerated versions of the sisters themselves. As well as her mental health issues, Josie shares Sadler’s belief that trauma is an interesting personality trait; ever the self-flagellator, she seems to revel in sending herself up. Josie, she insists, “is the worst one, because she’s such a pure narcissist. She really believes she’s the main character – everything revolves round her.”View image in fullscreenCake walkthrough … Simon Bird directing Such Brave Girls.Photograph: Vishal Sharma/BBC/Various Artists LimitedLike her character, the real-life Sadler comes across as thoughtful and amenable – but doesn’t share her fictional alter ego’s cartoonish passivity; Josie is people-pleasing to the point of ridiculousness. Davidson, meanwhile, tells me she identifies with Billie’s “obsession with attention”, which her character often attracts via aggro melodrama. In person, she is mischievously irreverent but far more laid-back than Billie, who also works in the bleak world of children’s entertainment (an opportunity for many strikingly incongruous costume choices; in one episode she arrives at an abortion clinic dressed as a witch).Series one of Such Brave Girls covered Josie’s attempts to get a girlfriend while blocking out the constant presence of her clammy, cockroach-like boyfriend Seb (Freddie Meredith), while Billie pursued her noncommittal “soulmate” Nicky (Sam Buchanan) with unhinged devotion. In the final episode, the pair attend their paternal grandmother’s funeral, hoping to confront their father, who popped out for teabags a decade ago and never came back. (When I tell Sadler I’d presumed that bit hadn’t actually happened, she replies: “No, not teabags.”) If series one was the long-awaited debut – into which Sadler could channel all the rich raw material she had accrued over her lifetime – series two is the difficult second album, requiring less literal truth and more imagination.Sadler initially didn’t let herself think about a follow-up – it would have been “too heartbreaking” if it hadn’t been recommissioned (“Like: what do I do with all these thoughts?!”). The writing process was daunting and exhausting. “I have gone loopy. Lizzie’s had to do a lot of mental health work on me this year to keep me going,” says Sadler. “A lot of phone calls, a lot of day trips, a lot of shopping,” nods Davidson. A breakthrough came when Sadler decided to turn up the intensity: the money aspect is “more stressful, the house is more cramped – everybody’s stuck”. Her north star was a determination “to make everyone’s lives worse”. I can confirm that series two is Such Brave Girls “squared”, as Brealey puts it: all the women’s romantic, financial and existential problems remain but intensified to nightmarish proportions.Sadler also decided to make a list of hot-button topics to weave into the script: “stuff that had been annoying me in the news or a concept I’d seen people get irritated about online. Then I’d think: how would our characters deal with that?” The answer, usually, is in the most unenlightened way possible: in series one, depression is an irritant, not conforming to beauty standards is “selfish”, therapists are cashing in on other people’s misery, trauma is a turn-on, sex is just something to “get through”, and suicide is used as emotional blackmail. Series two, meanwhile, mercilessly satirises the idea of contented singledom, and puts uproariously novel spins on age-gap affairs and coercive control.Such Brave Girls review – properly brutal and properly funnyRead moreThis is one of the secrets of Such Brave Girls’ success: it combines contemporary relevance – the show is essentially about a depressed woman grappling with her sexuality – with an utter lack of compassion and empathy. Yet while the show rebels against the sanctimony that has plagued modern comedy, it doesn’t hark back to old-school political incorrectness. The jokes about Josie’s exponentially serious mental health issues do not punch down because they closely mimic Sadler’s own experiences. “If you lived it, if it has truth, you can get away with anything,” she says.Still, in a landscape of warm, big-hearted, issue-led comedy, Such Brave Girls feels deliciously risque. For series two, Sadler was focused on “how nefarious we can make our characters” and “who else we can annoy with our show”. “How much offence we can cause,” adds Brealey. Does Sadler think the show caused offence? “I don’t really look online at that stuff,” she says, brow furrowed.If she had, she wouldn’t have found much pushback. Such Brave Girls has achieved a rare feat: a not safe, not nice and genuinely boundary-pushing sitcom that hasn’t caused any discernible upset. Which, for a criticism junkie like Sadler, might not be the news she was hoping for.Series two of Such Brave Girls airs on 3 July on BBC Three and iPlayer.The charityMindis available on 0300 123 3393 andChildlineon 0800 1111.In the US, call or textMental Health Americaat 988 or chat 988lifeline.org.

Fresh doubt cast on authenticity of National Gallery RubensFormer curator’s comments, later withdrawn, reignite debate over attribution of Samson and Delilah paintingDalya AlbergeSun 15 Jun 2025 05.11 EDTLast modified on Sun 15 Jun 2025 15.20 EDTShareIt is an unwelcome question, but an important one: did theNational Gallerybuy a £2.5m dud?This has remained the suspicion of many experts since one of Britain’s premier cultural institutions acquired Samson and Delilah, a long-lost masterpiece by the Flemish artist Peter Paul Rubens, in 1980.Forty-five years on, the debate has been stirred once again, with apetition launchedcalling for the National Gallery to honour its 1997 promise to stage a public debate on its authenticity.This time, it’s not the front of the painting that’s under scrutiny – it’s the back of it.The debate began soon after theNational Gallerybought the biblical depiction, known to have been painted by the master around 1609 before being lost for centuries. For the gallery, it was a 17th-century jewel in its collection, the sort of work to which tourists would flock.But some immediately began to question the brushwork (too clumsy), describing it as a brash 20th-century copy of the original – and these doubts have only intensified. Katarzyna Krzyżagórska-Pisarek, a Rubens scholar, described the Samson and Delilah as “highly problematic” and “oddly modern”.And Christopher Wright, a leading specialist in 17th-century paintings, said the picture itself was simply “wrong”. He added: “It lacks Rubens’s subtlety. It has a beguiling, slush-and-splosh grandeur … All my instincts of knowing about old masters bring me to that observation. It’s not a 17th-century picture.”Feelings run deep in the art world over the question of the painting’s origins. Michael Daley, the director ofArtWatch UK, has researched the painting extensively and claims to have uncovered a mountain of evidence against the Rubens attribution. He calls it “the biggest of all museum scandals” and “a top-down conspiracy to conceal a massive purchasing blunder that debases Rubens’s oeuvre”.The latest twist in this enduring saga comes courtesy of remarks made – and then withdrawn – by Christopher Brown, a former curator of the National Gallery, who headed the Dutch and Flemish collections.Speaking to the Guardian, Brown insisted the painting was authentic, but intriguingly, he also said it was the National Gallery that had attached a modern blockboard to the painting’s back.This apparent admission has electrified the Rubens doubters once more.The backs of pictures often carry as much history as the front. With Samson, the panel on which the painting was originally painted has been planed down and attached to a modern blockboard, covering up whatever was underneath.Critics suspect that the original panel may have held crucial evidence relating to the date of the painting.The doubters also think the picture’s traditional cradled support was removed at the time.This would mean any clues to the Samson and Delilah’s origins and age – and therefore its authenticity – have disappeared. One piece of evidence on the panel might have been the makers’ monogram, the application of which was the done thing in 17th-century Antwerp. If a panel-maker’s mark had showed the panel to have been made later than around 1609, that would have shown that the painting was almost certainly a copy.When the gallery acquired the painting in 1980, there was no talk of a blockboard – it was bought as a panel.The gallery’s first public mention of the blockboard was in its 1983 technical bulletin report, with an earlier reference in its 1982 board minutes, when Brown was seeking permission to clean the painting.That was after the gallery had owned it for two years and its timber expert, Anthony Reeve, had described it as one of three unproblematic panels.The National Gallery said the painting’s back had been glued to a blockboard sheet “probably during the [20th] century”, adding in a 1990s exhibition catalogue: “The Samson and Delilah was planed down to a thickness of about 3mm and set into a new blockboard panel before it was acquired by the National Gallery in 1980 and so no trace of a panel maker’s mark can be found.”However, an eminent art historian’s condition report before the 1980 auction stated that the panel was “excellently preserved” and measured between 25mm and 40mm in thickness.And herein lies the mystery: who planed down the panel and glued it to modern blockboard, when did they do it and why? Several renowned experts have questioned the logic behind the decision, considering it had been described as being in good shape.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toArt WeeklyFree weekly newsletterYour weekly art world round-up, sketching out all the biggest stories, scandals and exhibitionsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

When the picture appeared at Christie’s, it looked immaculate. If the panel had been insecure, it would have been obvious.”When approached by the Guardian, Brown said itwasthe gallery that put on the blockboard – a brand-new admission from a former curator held in the utmost regard.Brown said: “The present backing was put on by the National Gallery … It’s rather a thin panel. It’s undoubtedly been thinned down at a certain stage and it was really to strengthen the panel.”However, after the Guardian approached the gallery for comment, Brown later changed his tune. He said: “The National Gallery says that the backboard was applied before its acquisition. I have no reason to disbelieve them, and am certainly not in a position to contradict them.”In his original interview, he had argued that “the idea that the National Gallery is in some way concealing something is nonsense” and that “the great scholars of Rubens have, since 1980, congratulated me”.Daley described Brown’s initial comments as “startling”, adding that he himself has “a 2002 correspondence with the gallery denying that this had been done by their restorers”.The painting had been previously attributed to lesser hands, and has no history as a Rubens before 1929, when it was found by Ludwig Burchard, a German historian who, after his death in 1960, was found to have misattributed paintings for commercial gain.Krzyżagórska-Pisarek has subsequently discovered that at least 75 works that Burchard attributed to Rubens have been officially demoted.She described the Samson and Delilah as “just the tip of the iceberg”, noting “the harsh, uniform red of Delilah’s dress” and Samson’s muscled back, which she said was “anatomically incorrect”, as well as a “curious lack of craquelure” – fine cracks that would be expected on a 400-year-old painting.She expressed frustration over the lack of debate, adding: “They don’t want a discussion because we’ve got arguments that are really impossible to answer. This cannot be the original Rubens.”Amid all the uncertainty, two things are for sure: the provenance of the painting will continue to send the art world into a spin, with scholars and aesthetes across the world continuing to call for that public debate.View image in fullscreenRubens experts say the National Gallery’s Samson and Delilah does not exhibit the painter’s subtlety.Photograph: Ian Dagnall/AlamyThe National Gallery said: “Samson and Delilah has long been accepted as a masterpiece by Peter Paul Rubens. Not one single Rubens specialist has doubted that the picture is by Rubens. Painted on wood panel in oil shortly after his return to Antwerp in 1608 and demonstrating all that the artist had learned in Italy, it is a work of the highest aesthetic quality.“A full discussion of the panel was published by Joyce Plesters and David Bomford in the Gallery’s Technical Bulletin in 1983, when Christopher Brown was the Gallery’s curator responsible for the picture. Their findings remain valid, including their unequivocal statement that the panel was attached to a support before the picture was acquired by the National Gallery.”Explore more on these topicsPaintingNational GalleryArtMuseumsnewsShareReuse this content"

Consider this when working out occupancy.”David Walker, of the Oasis Collectors Group, reportedly said: “To call fans drunk, middle-aged, and fat is a nasty, sneering stereotype, it’s a jaundiced view.”Margaret Graham, the council’s culture and communities convener, told the paper: “We’re very proud to host the biggest and best events in Edinburgh throughout the year, which bring in hundreds of millions of pounds to the local economy and provide unparalleled entertainment for our residents and visitors.“As with any major event which takes place in the city, we prepare extensively alongside our partners to ensure the safety and best possible experience of everyone involved – and Oasis are no different.”She added: “We’re all looking forward to seeing Oasis take to the stage this August and I’m sure that they’ll ‘live forever’ as some of the most memorable concerts ever performed at Murrayfield.”Explore more on these topicsLiam GallagherOasisEdinburghScotlandLocal governmentnewsShareReuse this content"

Except the test conditions are so flawed it does no such thing…Jack SealeSun 15 Jun 2025 18.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 15 Jun 2025 18.01 EDTShareHundreds of people die on British roads every year, with tens of thousands injured – and the multi-vehicle motorway crash is the most terrifyingly lethal way a car journey can go wrong. But the good news is, reality TV is on the case. Welcome to the car-crash telly that is Pile Up: World’s Biggest Crash Test, a programme that, suitably enough, hurls several different documentary genres together with messy results.The problem that needs addressing is this. Experts studying road safety have long been able to propel cars into one other under laboratory conditions, but controlled tests lack the crucial element of flawed humans with unpredictable reactions; actual crashes obviously do involve fickle drivers, but we don’t know when they’ll happen, so nobody’s there to capture high-quality footage from every angle.The Rehearsal season two review – TV so wild you will have no idea how they made itRead moreThe solution, years in the making and dreamed up by top smash boffinProf James Brighton of Cranfield University, is a grand experiment that luckily lends itself to light-factual television. Four ordinary motorists are invited to attend a Scottish airstrip that has been converted to a lifesize mockup of a stretch of motorway. They are told they’re to take part in a study of driving habits. What they’re not told is that Brighton has arranged for an articulated lorry to drive sideways across all four lanes without warning, guaranteeing that the guinea pigs will be involved in a pile-up and allowing full scrutiny of their split-second attempts to avoid disaster.Even the lawless free-for-all that is reality TV in 2025 wouldn’t lure people into a probably-fatal car crash under false pretences, though, so all the vehicles have been rigged up to be driven remotely. The stooges sit in static cars a couple of hundred metres away, with their steering, accelerating and braking simulated in real time on a wraparound video screen. The problem with this is that it surely isn’t an accurate representation of how these people would react in real life. They can’t feel the acceleration when they press the pedal and aren’t burdened with the fear of serious injury.Perhaps to distract from this, or just to fill the inexplicably epic two-hour slot Channel 4 has given Pile Up, the programme throws all manner of other stuff at us. It leans into the reality-show element heavily, introducing us to its four disparate volunteers – a carefree 19-year-old woman, a man in his 20s who is a self-confessed boy racer, a nervous grandmother, and a guy who, er, doesn’t really have any pertinent foibles but seems nice – by filming them driving in everyday life, packing to leave for Scotland, meeting one other, being allocated a car, comparing notes after their test drives, and so on. Everyone’s encouraged to play up to their personality type, apart from the chap who doesn’t have one, and they’re soon caricaturing themselves happily.If that doesn’t entertain you, swathes of the programme are taken up with sensational dashcam footage of real incidents, of the kind normally featured in cheap documentaries on obscure satellite channels that are called something like Britain’s Worst Drivers Volume 12: B-Road Bedlam. Such shows marry up the barrage of clips with a torrent of facts, and Pile Up is no different: approximately 17% of the voiceover here is made up of intimidating statistics about speed limits and seatbelts.When the experiment does finally take place, it’s rigged with false jeopardy. Professional crash-scene investigators are invited to analyse the pile-up post hoc, without access to the slow-motion video and 3D modelling that everyone else is looking at, as a contrived test of their skills. Plus, it’s suggested that the test is not just groundbreaking, but controversial: “A lot of naysayers [said] this was never going to work,” says one of Brighton’s triumphant colleagues, after it’s all over. A lot of naysayers? Really? Sadly, the unlikely claim that the scientific crash-test community is a cesspit of cynical haters is left unexplored, but if they do exist, these naysayers may have had a point, since none of the most interesting conclusions end up deriving from the way the human drivers responded, which was meant to be what made the stunt unique.The thing is, though, none of this programme’s manifest snags really matter. The experiment may not have worked on its own terms, but the sense of dread when the innocent drivers are unknowingly approaching the hazard is real, as is their emotional reaction when they see the state their cars are left in. If people at home are disturbed enough to slow down and pay more attention next time they’re on a motorway, lives will be saved. Pile Up does get to somewhere worthwhile in the end, even if it takes a circuitous route.Pile Up: World’s Biggest Crash Test is on Channel 4 nowExplore more on these topicsTelevision & radioTV reviewTelevisionReality TVreviewsShareReuse this content"

But there is little chemistry in her relationship with Vronsky (Seamus Dillane) – the rakish military man for whom she leaves her loveless marriage, and he is a non-character, left uncoloured.Phillip Breen’s adaptation of the novel is however, always original, without playing fast and loose with the story. There is an inspired use of music, especially in the sound of a weeping or skittering violin. It is theatrically daring, with the ensemble sitting on regal seats when they are not performing, and a loose, handsome set, designed by Max Jones creates a sense of desolated opulence.‘A gift of a role for a mother’: Game of Thrones star Natalie Dormer on playing Tolstoy’s tortured Anna KareninaRead moreModern language is set against the period setting and dress. “Marriage, I’d rather stick pins in my eyes,” says longsuffering wife, Dolly (Naomi Sheldon), summing up the kernel of Tolstoy’s story in vernacular. The intention, it seems, is to bring these characters closer home to us.But the emotional life of the story seems rather too surface-bound. Scenarios and relationships are infused with a high wire kind of comedy which works to amuse, but it keeps the drama from gathering tragic depths. And there are too many directorial tics and flourishes which are clever but blithe.The set has the sense of a child’s nursery, with Dolly or Anna’s children playing with toys around its edges. It is one of Breen’s clever flourishes, relating to the weaponising of children within marriage – particular in the case of Karenin (Tomiwa Edun), Anna’s spurned husband, who enacts his vengeance through their son, from whom Anna becomes forcibly estranged.The production glows with the ambition of reflecting the full scope of the novel, from the era’s discoveries – electricity and trains – to social divides, to arguments around love v marriage, and the moral relativism of Russia’s gilded nobility. But it feels simultaneously brisk and too long, at three hours, in trying to cover so much.It strives to capture the psychological acuity of the novel too. Characters talk their feelings aloud so we hear what they feel and what they say. It is a heavy-handed way to animate their inner worlds: a “telling” over dramatising, with an uncertain note of comedy.View image in fullscreenHumour and tenderness … David Oakes as Levin and Shalisha James-Davis as Kitty in Anna Karenina.Photograph: Marc BrennerThere is a convincing fractiousness between unfaithful husband Stiva (Jonnie Broadbent, a mischievous wastrel), and Dolly; Sheldon gives a compelling performance of marital regret, her outcome an inverse parallel to Anna’s social shaming. Together the characters encompass the catch-22 for women marooned in bad marriages – they suffer whether they walk out or stay. But the modern language sits awkwardly when it is underlined in Dolly’s verbal meltdown, bringing a maelstrom of F-words in inner monologue.The relationship that sparks most on stage is that between Levin (based on Tolstoy himself, played by Dormer’s partner David Oakes) and Kitty (Shalisha James-Davis), from its humour to its tenderness.Anna’s outcome is foreshadowed from the start with a barrage of theatrical devices: music that mirrors the noise and speed of a train, a child’s wooden train set at the front of the stage, and characters performing locomotive sounds, including hoots that sound like screeches of pain. They lay out the ground for Anna’s terrible end across the train tracks. Except here, there is only a vague symbolic suggestion of it. Those who know the story will see the subtlety but those encountering it for the first time may be left with an approximate idea of what has happened.You do not feel its tragedy, perhaps as a result, nor the emptiness of Karenin’s vengeance on Anna, which leaves his son bereft of maternal love. Instead, you admire the production for its sometimes brilliant ideas.Anna Karenina is atChichester Festival theatre, until 28 JuneExplore more on these topicsTheatreChichester Festival theatreLeo TolstoyreviewsShareReuse this content"

Another brand new work by Colin Matthews – his vivid Quartet No 6 – featured the following morningFlora WillsonSun 15 Jun 2025 09.26 EDTLast modified on Sun 15 Jun 2025 09.53 EDTShareFew events feel as haunted as theAldeburgh festival. Nearly 80 years since it wasestablished by Benjamin Britten and Peter Pears– and decades since their deaths – the couple still loom large in its Suffolk environs, their project continued by younger friends and collaborators.None are more eminent than the composerColin Matthews, whoassisted Brittenin the final years of his life. Now 79, Matthews has produced his own first opera, on a Chekhov-inspired libretto byWilliam Boyd: the world premiere of A Visit to Friends opened this year’s festival, on the same stage where Britten’s Death in Venice made its debut 52 years ago.A Visit to Friends features an opera within the opera: scenes of a work with a libretto by Chekhov and a score by an unknown composer that Matthews models onScriabinare interrupted by the “real world” of rehearsals. Life imitates art imitating life; it’s “a very complicated visit to friends”, as one character says. We hop between stages of the rehearsal process, while the internal opera’s plot pushes on.View image in fullscreenNaturalism … A Visit to Friends at Aldeburgh festival.Photograph: Richard Hubert SmithInLeanne Vandenbussche’s ingeniously simple set, the wall of a modern rehearsal room revolves to reveal the disintegrating veranda of a once-grand Russian house. Harsh lighting flicks up as run-throughs are halted. The rehearsal pianist slides on and off (upright and all). Colours play constantly across a video backdrop, as if taking the temperature of the action. Matthews’ score moves between the charged, late-Romantic meandering of the internal opera and something a little more incisive for the rehearsals. But much of the music is slow and delicately loose-limbed, its stagiest moment (a freeze-frame-like trio and quartet) in “real life”, not the fictional opera. Gesturally, though, the opera’s thespiness – hand-clasping, studied pointing, walking with an extravagant turning-circle – is a world away from the rehearsal’s naturalism.That the self-conscious cleverness of the framing device didn’t pall says much about both the quality of performance and the lucidity ofRachael Hewer’s production. The small cast was uniformly excellent:Marcus Farnsworthwas smoothly unpleasant as Misha/Marcus,Susanna Hurrella bright, brittle Nadia/Natalie andEdward Hawkinsa pitch-perfect parody of a certain brand of director.Lotte Betts-Dean’s Varia/Vanessa dominated, her mezzo so effusively rounded it was as if she kept finding the resonant frequency of the auditorium. Conducted byJessica Cottis,Aurora Orchestrarevelled in Matthews’ suavely luminous score.More Matthews followed the next morning: the world premiere by theGildas Quartetof his Quartet No 6, between the Three Idylls byBritten’s teacher Frank Bridgeand Beethoven’s String Quartet No 9 in C, Op 59 No 3. The eight movements of Matthews’ quartet were vividly characterised: there were impish cascades of pizzicato, melodic lines that wandered, unhurried, and a slow-motion elegy that lingered like the perfume of a loved one. Bridge’s Three Idylls showcased the Gildas’s fine-grained, mellow tone and total musical symbiosis. Their Beethoven was exquisitely stylish, from the cool, vibrato-free introduction to its final intoxicating rush. It was an utterly compelling performance: exhilarating playing that urged us to listen anew.The Aldeburgh festivalcontinues until 29 June.Explore more on these topicsClassical musicSnape MaltingsOperareviewsShareReuse this content"

But it’s a good one. Slamming into Italy, theSwiss national parkin Graubünden’s Engadin valley is an utterly wild Unesco biosphere reserve. Nature has been in charge here since the park’s formation in 1914, and as a result, it’s hiking heaven. The full-day, 13-mile trek from Zernez toLais da Macun(the Macun lakes) takes in a plateau beaded with 23 Alpine lakes. If you prefer company, sign up for guidedranger walks, including a wildlife-focused one in theVal Trupchunwhere, with luck and binoculars, you might spot marmots, ibex, chamois, deer and bearded vultures.How to do itWith good rail connections, Zernez is the gateway to the park and home to the visitor centre.Guided ranger hikes cost about £36.

Central Europe’s third largest lake, it delivers a massive shot of everything that makes Europe great – Roman ruins, medieval castles, gardens, gorges, wetlands, vineyards, orchards, thermal baths and beaches where you can strip off sweaty Lycra for a quick swim or a night spent camping under the stars. Looping around the lake and taking about a week to complete, the 170-mile (273km)Lake Constance Cycle Path, or Bodensee-Radweg as it’s known locally, is the biggie, rolling through three countries: Germany, Austria and Switzerland.How to do itAvoid the midsummer madness of July and August for fewer crowds. Bikes and ebikes can be rented in towns fringing the lake.

Ways to explore are many and varied – there’s an easy four-mile round trek past waterfall-wisped peaks to Briksdalsbreen, an offshoot of the mighty glacier, or an opportunity to kayak, canoe and paddleboard across the turquoise waters of Lovatnet Lake, with rock walls punching above. For a close encounter with the ice, slip on a helmet and crampons to trek across the Haugabreen arm of the glacier.How to do itOn the dreamy shores of Lovatnet Lake,Sande Camping(pitches from £18) is a crazily pretty spot to pitch a tent.

Here, limestone turrets and pinnacles rise like natural fortifications above forests and glacial lakes that chart the spectrum of blues and greens. Loveliest of the lot is mirror-like Lake Bohinj, where you can dive into jewel-coloured waters that reach 22C in summer. The pebble beach in Ukanc, on the lake’s western shore, is as lovely a spot as any. Arrive early in the morning and you’ll have it all to yourself as you swim, canoe, kayak or paddleboard in glassy waters.How to do itPitch a tent on the shore at eco-friendlyCamp Bohinj(pitches from £25).

You can admire them from below, but you’ll get much closer on the 75-mile Alta Via 1, one of Italy’s most memorable hikes, reaching from Dobbiaco in the north to Belluno in the south. Negotiating steep, rocky inclines is rewarded with sublime views and stays at rustic huts likeRifugio LagazuoiandRifugio Cinque Torri, where you can dig into local specialities like polenta, venison andcanederli(bread dumplings with speck and cheese), peer up at star-blanketed night skies and get a crack‑of-dawn start on the trail.How to do itWhile the walk is certainly doable alone (book huts ahead for summer and get hold ofCicerone’s Alta Via 1 guide), logistically it’s easier to join a tour, such as the 10-night trip offered byAlpine Exploratory(from £2,880guided, £1,790self-guided).Castle-hopping in Germany’s Bavarian AlpsView image in fullscreenSchloss Neuschwanstein was the inspiration for Disney’s Sleeping Beauty castle.Photograph: Robert Wyatt/AlamyWhere the Bavarian Alps muscle their way into Austria, Füssen looks like something out of a children’s story. The old town’s alleys are stacked with gabled, frescoed houses and cafe-lined squares, and lofty castles bear the fantastical imprint of “Mad” King Ludwig II (1845-1886). Mad or not, he had an eye for a winning location, which you’ll appreciate when you visit the riotously turreted and recently revampedSchloss Neuschwanstein, which was the blueprint for Disney’s Sleeping Beauty castle, andmedieval Hohenschwangau, where little Ludwig grew up. There’s hiking, cycling and swimming at the lakes around Füssen, such as Forggensee, Hopfensee and Alpsee. All can be reached by bus for free with the local Füssen Card.How to do itFüssen is two hours from Munich by bus and train (bahn.de). Take your pick of hotels and B&Bs in the town, such asHotel Sonne(doubles from £130 B&B) in the historic centre, or camp by one of the lakes.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe TravellerFree newsletterGet travel inspiration, featured trips and local tips for your next break, as well as the latest deals from Guardian HolidaysEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Here you can hike among jagged, lake-splashed peaks, ancient oak and beech forests, and deep, wildflower-flecked valleys where it’s silent enough to hear your own heartbeat – or perhaps the cry of a golden eagle. The untamed terrain here is best explored with a guide. For a deep dive,Much Better Adventuresarranges a challenging hut-to-hut trek, ticking off highs such as the glacial Lakes of Covadonga, the 2,319-metre summit of La Padiorna and the sheer-walled Cares Gorge.How to do itMuch Better Adventures’ six-night, small-group trek costs from £875 per person, including local guides, breakfast, dinner and stays in mountain huts and rural guesthouses.Waterfalls, springs and caves at Plitvice LakesinCroatiaView image in fullscreenPlitvice Lakes is a Unesco World Heritage site.Photograph: Sorin Colac/AlamyMost people who head to Croatia dash straight to the coast, but a step back from the Adriatic is the Unesco World Heritage sitePlitvice Lakes national park. Against the backdrop of the karstic Dinaric Alps, the park has mineral-rich springs, cascading falls, caves and lakes that glitter jade, aquamarine, ink-blue and turquoise. Brown bears, wild boar, lynx and wolves prowl the old-growth beech and fir forests, and clouds of blue-winged butterflies bring a fairytale touch in summer. For a true flavour of the park, bring binoculars and follow the 11-mile Route K, a full-day hike that knits together all 16 of the lakes.How to do itFrom Zagreb, buses andFlixBuscoaches run frequently to Plitvička Jezera in just over two hours. There are lots of traditional stone-and-wood villas where you can spend the night, includingVilla Verde(doubles from £93 B&B).A front-row view of the EigerinSwitzerlandView image in fullscreenThe Eiger Express cable car.Photograph: David Birri/JungfraubahnenSwitzerland’s outrageously beautiful Jungfrau region is the Alps on steroids, with its crashing waterfalls, gemstone lakes, cliff-hugging villages and the glacier-capped big three of the Eiger, Mönch and Jungfrau looming above it all. You could base yourself anywhere in these heights and reach the summits within minutes on vintage railways and state-of-the-art cable cars – but Grindelwald has the edge for outdoor adventure. As lively in summer as winter, the village has front-row views of the Eiger’s mile-high north face. TheEiger Expresscable car links up to Eigergletscher, the trailhead for the astoundingly scenic, two-hourEiger Trail. Or you can thunder towards the Eiger on ziplines, mountain carts and chunky scooters calledTrottibikesfrom theFirstcable car station above Grindelwald.How to do itGrindelwald is well connected by rail and can be reached in around nine hours from London via Paris, Strasbourg, Basel and Interlaken.

But when the snow melts, the village reveals its mellower side, with trails skipping through flower-freckled pastures to Alpine dairy huts likePutzen Alpe, where you can sample abrettljause(sharing board) of local ham and cheese, and watch the bell-swinging cows come home in the honeyed light of late afternoon. If you want to zone out even more from the rush of daily life, St Anton is right up there with the best places in the Alps for a spot of peak-gazing while doing yoga. Pick a meadow to practise your positions or sign up for classes and retreats atArlflow.How to do itSt Anton is an hour from Innsbruck by train. In early September, the four-dayMountain Yoga Festival, celebrating its 10th anniversary in 2025,brings some of the world’s best teachers and yogis to the heights, with outdoor sessions, sunrise meditation, Alpine pasture hikes, talks and workshops.

If you would prefer to give them the slip, head south toCefn Coed, a 17th-century, off-grid Welsh farm estate embedded in a wooded valley, where the slopes of Cadair Idris roll down to the shifting sands of theMawddach estuary. It’s all about embracing thewild side of Eryri (Snowdonia) here, whether you’re striking out on foot on the nine-mileMawddach Trail, which follows an old slate railway track, practising yoga in nature, going wildlife tracking or foraging for edibles you can transform into pickles, powders and pestos. Find your own wild swim spots along the river by day, and go on a starlit walk across the estate to look out for owls, badgers and, on mid-summer nights, glow-worms.How to do itCambrian Linetrains stop in Barmouth, four miles from Cefn Coed, where you cancamp in a clearing in oak woods(pitches £25-35), or for bigger groups there’sa 12-bed bunkhousein the farm’s original dairy and bakehouse (two-night stays from £350).Explore more on these topicsSummer holidaysEurope holidaysWalking holidaysWalkingCycling holidaysSwimming holidaysCamping holidaysfeaturesShareReuse this content"

When I finally discovered the soft, chewy American originals in a subterranean outlet at Birmingham New Street station, my teenage mind was officially blown. These are even better.Prep25 min, plus chillingCook15 minMakes15120g room-temperature butter170g dark chocolate75g light brown sugar75g granulated sugar½ tsp vanilla extractA pinch of salt1 egg, beaten240g plain flour½ tsp bicarbonate of sodaSea salt flakes(optional)1 Make sure the butter is softView image in fullscreenMake sure your butter is soft enough to beat – if your kitchen is very cold, or you’ve forgotten to get it out of the fridge in time, dice it and leave it out on the counter while you gather together the rest of the ingredients. I tend to use salted butter for baking, as for everything else, but it’s up to you.2 Chop the chocolateView image in fullscreenRoughly chop the chocolate into small pieces; I like dark as a contrast to the sweet cookie dough, but you can use milk or white as you prefer, or a combination. (You could also swap some of it for chopped nuts, if you like, though this is not canonical.)Chocolatechips save you time, but don’t melt in the same way.3 Beat the butterPut the butter in a stand mixer, or in a bowl anchored to the counter with a damp tea towel, and beat with the paddle attachment, electric beaters or a wooden spoon until very soft and spreadable, scraping down the sides of the bowl as necessary.4 Now for the sugarsView image in fullscreenBeat in the sugars; this is my preferred combination, because the relatively high water content of soft brown sugar keeps the dough moist and gives it a caramel flavour, while granulated demerara dissolves less easily, resulting in a slight crunch, but feel free to experiment with other options. Dark brown sugar will yield treacly notes, caster a smoother texture.5 Add the beaten eggView image in fullscreenAdd the vanilla extract and a pinch of salt, then, with the mixer still running (or still working hard with your wooden spoon), gradually work in the beaten egg until you have a smooth, homogenous mixture, again scraping down the sides of the bowl as required.6 Fold in the flour and chocolateView image in fullscreenSift the flour and bicarbonate of soda on top (or whisk them in a bowl first), then fold into the butter and sugar mixture – once it’s thoroughly combined, try not to overwork the dough, because stirring develops the gluten, leading to tough cookies (not a good thing, in this instance). Fold in the chocolate pieces or other additions.7 Chill the doughCover and chill. I like to refrigerate the dough at least overnight (it’s good for up to 72 hours) to develop the flavour. Once chilled, divide the dough into golf ball-sized rounds and heat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6. (If you’re in a hurry and don’t have time to chill the dough, divide and shape, then pop into the freezer while the oven’s heating up.)View image in fullscreen8 Bake the cookiesLine two baking trays with greaseproof paper, then arrange the cookie dough balls spaced well apart on top. Bake for about 15 minutes, until golden but not browned – swap around the trays halfway through cooking, to ensure both sets of cookies bake evenly. Remove and leave the cookies on the trays to cool and firm up, then sprinkle them with a few salt flakes, if you like.9 And to make an extra batch …It’s worth making double the amount of dough, shaping into balls and freezing the excess, so you can have freshly baked chocolate chip cookies in about 20 minutes. To stop them sticking together, space the balls out on a tray and freeze solid, then tip into a bag for easier storage. Bake straight from frozen, adding a couple of minutes on to the baking time.Felicity Cloake’s new book, Peach Street to Lobster Lane: Coast to Coast in Search of Real American Cuisine, is published by Mudlark at £16.99.

No, come back, please – don’t be scared. There are tables, chairs, napkins, reservations and all the other accoutrements of a bricks-and-mortar restaurant, even if this metal box may at some point in its existence once have been used to ship things to China and back. To my mind, Wapping Wharf has gone from strength to strength in recent years, and no longer feels at all like one of those novelty “box parks” that have about them a heavy whiff of the edgy temporary fixture. Today’s Wapping Wharf is a true independent food destination in its own right, and with a bird’s-eye view from one of Ragù’s window seats, while eating venison rump withgorgonzola dolceand sipping a booze-free vermouth, you can watch the crowds head for the likes of the modern FrenchLapin, Tokyo dinerSeven Lucky Gods, modern BritishBox-E,Gurt Wingsand many more; by day, there’s also a bakery, a butcher, a fromagerie and so on.Of course, anyone who calls their sophisticated modern Italian restaurant Ragù clearly didn’t live in the UK through the 1980s. For me, as for many others, ragu will always be sold in a glass jar and advertised viacaterwauling operatic dittiesduring the breaks onITV’s London’s Burning: “Ragu, it brings out the Italian in you,” etc. This was back in a time when Britain’s attitude to Italian cuisine stretched, broadly speaking, as far as spag bol, though many of us were at a loss to tackle the “bol” part of that equation without Unilever’s industrially squished sieved tomatoes at 79p a jar.View image in fullscreenRagù’s ‘crisp, lightly battered’ Roman artichoke fritti with aïoli.Those days are long gone, however, and the evidence is clear to see at Ragù, with its crisp, lightly battered artichoke fritters with a punchy aïoli, its Hereford onglet with cipollotti onion, and its cannoli with rhubarb curd and pistachio. Ragù caters to a young-ish, knowing audience who are well aware that Britain’s current Italian dining culture was shaped bythe River Cafe,Angela HartnettandGiorgio Locatelli. Owners Mark and Karen Chapman openedCoron North Street, Bedminster, in 2022, where they serve clever, fancy yet erring-on-the-hearty Mediterranean plates – think Catalan sausage with clams and fino butter sauce followed by tonka bean creme caramel. At Ragù, meanwhile, their focus is wholly Italian and, to my mind, this could be some of the most skilful cooking anywhere in Britain right now. I recommend the place wholly, effusively and slightly enviously of anyone who gets to taste the heavenly tiramisu made with sumptuously soggy slices of panettone before I get the chance to return.View image in fullscreen‘The greatest, richest, most drinkable tomato brodo I’ve ever tasted’: Ragù’s crespelle in tomato brodo.After the artichokefritti, we moved on to a bowl of humble-sounding “crespelle in tomato brodo, spinach and sheep’s ricotta”. That’s cheese pancakes in tomato sauce, right? Wrong. Very wrong. This was the greatest, richest, most drinkable-by-the-bucket tomato brodo I’ve ever tasted. Juicy, sweet, sharp and rich in all the right dimensions. What are they doing to tomatoes back there in that tiny kitchen?Next up, slow-cooked shoulder of lamb, pulled off the bone, shaped into a loose patty, placed on top of a fresh pea stew and dotted with a sharp salsa verde and earthy pecorino. The star of the show, however, was the Ashton Court venison, cooked rare but as soft as butter, then given plenty of colour in a hot pan and served on pungent gorgonzola with bone marrow butter. This is not a dish for the faint-hearted or slender of appetite. Those wanting something lighter might opt for the skate wing with salmoriglio and courgette and fennel salad, or even the tagliolini with Devon crab, but this is cooking that lends itself to excess.View image in fullscreenRagù’s chocolate budino with sour cherries and amaretti: ‘Almost too much.’Service was fantastically prompt throughout, as the young team coped with the Saturday night chaos with calm aplomb. Desserts are another highlight, with three types of Italian cheese (robiola la tur,ubriaco rossoand taleggio) and a gelato, which on that day was a pink grapefruit and Campari sorbet, but please leave room, if possible, for the chocolatebudinowith sour cherries – a thick, almost-too-much truffle-type cake with huge, boozy cherries and crumbed amaretti biscuits. It’s like an Italian take on theSt Emilion au chocolat, or perhaps the French stole it from the Italians in the first place? I’m not sure who makes it better, but it’s a fight I’d happily referee. Either way, Ragù might very well be my favourite new restaurant of 2025, and we’ve barely reached summer yet. All hail the Bristol riviera.RagùUnit 25, Cargo 2, Museum Street, Wapping Wharf, Bristol BS3, 01179 110218. Open lunch Tues-Thurs, lunch noon-3.30pm, dinner 5-10pm; Fri & Sat all day, noon-10pm.
