Such is the overriding impression wrought by Under Salt Marsh, a six-part crime drama set in the fictional Welsh town of Morfa Halen. As the title suggests, the town sits alongside the treacherously boggy lands, under lowering skies and just, but only just, above rising sea levels. The latter is threatening to make the defences the inhabitants are struggling to build obsolete. A huge storm is thought to be approaching and emergency evacuation warnings readied. Think of the place as a conservation area for the pathetic fallacy. There is a lot of actual and metaphorical gloom about. Much of it is attached to local primary school teacher Jackie Ellis (Kelly Reilly). Already bowed under the weight of her nine-year-old niece Nessa’s (Amara Atwal) disappearance three years ago, she finds the body of one of her pupils, Cefin, as she walks home across the marshes one night. The child has apparently drowned in a drainage ditch.When detective Eric Bull (Rafe Spall), who was also involved in Nessa’s case, arrives to investigate the boy’s death, it becomes clear from his and Jackie’s immediate hostility that they have a fraught history – although its precise nature differs slightly from the one audiences have come to expect. It’s a series that is good at subverting expectations at every turn – not least in its delicate evocation of grief and the manifold ways a landscape can affect its people. Morfa Halen’s townsfolk are hardy and self-reliant, qualities born of their environment and isolation. But the drama poses the question of whether such independence serves a person or a community equally well under more extreme circumstances – be they meteorological or emotional – or whether a community can implode under the strain.Creator Claire Oakley parcels out her plot carefully – possibly a little too slowly, unless your appetite for brooding shots of liminal flatlands and distant mountains is inexhaustible – and clues, questions and suspects accrue. A missing pair of blue wellies, a partial handprint in the mud and a saltwater/freshwater differential suggest the boy did not die in the ditch but was moved there from elsewhere. This in turn suggests another party’s involvement and the possibility that it could also shed light on Nessa’s fate.The local landlady’s unstable son Osian (Julian Lewis Jones) has much to say about his belief that the town is being poisoned and an alibi for the night of Cefin’s death. A new lead comes in the form of the discovery, via a box of schoolwork and other mementoes that Jackie has kept, in which both Nessa and Cefin drew a picture of what looks like an astronaut before they went missing. But Cefin’s best friend James (Osian Emlyn) tells them it is of “the bee man”. This leads them to the people who “live in unison with the Earth” on nearby Spider Island. Kieran (Nigel James Bradley), their resident apiarist, was interviewed as a possible suspect in Nessa’s disappearance but Jackie’s knowledge of her home town and its inhabitants’ histories reveal a truth more painful to Cefin’s father than the arrest of his son’s killer would have been. Another great strength of Under Salt Marsh is its teasing out of the inevitable connections, crosscurrents and secrets that bind a community but can also fracture it under pressure.We also get insight into the personal lives of the two main characters. Bull is unexpectedly recognised by one of the visiting men from the environmental institute, and we realise he too is keeping an important secret. The way the local people treat Jackie indicates some common knowledge of past troubles, and her casual assignations with James’s uncle Dylan (Harry Lawtey) – whose own alibi for the night of the probable murder is not fully established – may be becoming less casual than either of them is prepared for.There were only two episodes available for review but, with a little leap of faith, viewers can surely look forward to a compelling, psychologically astute thriller that manages to weave a thoughtful meditation on the ramifications of isolation and suffering round its narrative poles. There is also the background presence ofJonathan Pryceas the dead boy’s grandfather, Solomon. So far, Solomon’s role has been limited to unleashing his sheep at the town hall meeting to show his contempt for the notion of evacuating the place, and later leading people in a shoreline hymn to commemorate his grandson. But you don’t hire Pryce just for this – Solomon surely has more of a part to play. We will have to wait, maybe slightly impatiently if the pace doesn’t pick up, and see.Under Salt Marsh aired on Sky Atlantic and is on NowExplore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewJonathan PrycereviewsShareReuse this content"

He never backs down for longJonathan FreedlandWhether it’s Minneapolis or Greenland, the US president will do just enough to get through a damaging news cycle, then carry on as beforeFri 30 Jan 2026 12.08 ESTLast modified on Fri 30 Jan 2026 14.20 ESTShareDon’t be fooled. When it comes toDonald Trump, what might look like a full retreat is almost always a mere tactical withdrawal, designed to buy time. He’ll step back when he’s forced to, under pressure, but will then revert the instant the pressure lets up. Too often, his opponents, whether at home or abroad, allow themselves to be played, confusing a mere pause for a surrender – and the risk is strong that they’re making that same mistake all over again.This week, the US president won praise in some quarters for moving to “de-escalate” the war he has been waging on the people of Minneapolis. Following thekilling of Alex Pretti, an intensive care nurse who posed no threat and yet was shot at least 10 times by masked agents of Customs and Border Protection or CBP, Trump signalled that hewanted to calm things down.Heshipped out the manwho had become the face of the campaign of terror conducted by both CBP and Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, Gregory Bovino, a buzzcut cliche of a villain whose chief mission appeared to be the generation of “content”, specifically images of himself strutting around Democrat-led cities like the general of an occupying army, right down tothe SS-style greatcoat.Next, Trump subjected his homeland security secretary, thepuppy-killingKristi Noem, to an emergency Oval Office meeting, from which his chief domestic policy adviser and the architect of the anti-immigrant purge, Stephen Miller, waspointedly excluded. To complete the picture, Trump spoke to Democratic leaders in Minnesota, later saying that he and they were now on“a similar wavelength”.That he felt compelled to make these moves is testament to the depth of revulsion prompted by Pretti’s killing. Video footage, as well as the dead man’s biography, made a mockery of the administration’s initial claims thatPretti was a “would-be assassin”bent on staging a “massacre”. In Pretti, as withRenee Nicole Good, the armed agents of the state had picked the wrong victim, someone Team Trump could not plausibly cast as “a domestic terrorist”, though that didn’t stop them trying.Two are dead in Minneapolis. Trump is to blame | Kenneth RothRead moreThe citizens of Minneapolis have also defied the script Miller and Trump wrote for them. They have refused to play the role of crazed urban mob, triggering the riot that would have handed Miller, in particular, the pretext he seems to crave to invokethe Insurrection Act, thereby allowing the White House to use the full force of the US military to crush domestic opposition. Instead, Minneapolitans have acted nonviolently, monitoring ICE rather than confronting it, armed with nothing more menacing than whistles.These facts have reached the US public, despite the White House’s efforts to shape an alternative, wholly false, reality. Credit for that goes to the reporters, and camera-wielding citizens, who have ensured that Americans, and the rest of the world, can see what ICE and CBP are doing. Plenty will have a specific image or detail they can point to as the one that proved too much to bear. For some, including voters who may well have once approved of Trump’s plans to crack down on illegal migration, it will have been the sight ofa terrified five-year-old boy, wearing a Spider-Man backpack, taken into custody by armed agents.For my own part, it was learning that, because thousands of people in Minneapolis have not left their homes for days for fear of being picked up, or worse, by the masked men of ICE, volunteers have taken todiscreetly delivering bags of groceries to their door. That leapt out because, as I discovered in the research for my bookThe Traitors Circle, a handful of dissident Germans used to perform the same act of kindness for the hidden Jews of Berlin under the Third Reich.Outrage that such deeds are necessary in the US of 2026 would not, on its own, have done enough to shift Trump. What proved more decisive was the misstep by several of his underlings, who argued that Pretti had made himself a legitimate target by carrying a firearm. That instantlyincensed the gun lobby, which is usually reflexively pro-Trump, but which has also long insisted on the right to bear arms, including at demonstrations.The nature of the Trumpians, asspelled out this month by the former White House strategist Steve Bannon, is to drive ever deeper until they meet resistance. When that resistance is the rock of the Maga base, and that rock cracks, they stop drilling.But, remember, it’s only ever a pause. The instant the pressure eases, normal service resumes. Having talked of de-escalation on Tuesday, Trump was back threatening Minneapolis’s Democratic mayor on Wednesday, warning him that he was“playing with fire”by standing in ICE’s way. On Thursday, Trump was asked if he was pulling back in Minnesota. “No, no. Not at all,” he replied. Later that night, federal agentsarrested ex-CNN anchor Don Lemonon charges relating to his presence at a protest at a Minnesota church earlier this month. Meanwhile, for all the earlier talk, both Noem and Miller remain in their jobs.In other words, there is no pivot. ICE is continuing to buy upwarehouse-style “mega” detention facilitiesfor the tens of thousands caught in its dragnet. And all the usual Trumpian excesses continue. Late in the week, the president filed a lawsuit against the Internal Revenue Service, seeking$10bn compensation for the leak of his past tax returns. Considering that he oversees the IRS, the decision on whether to settle the case by paying Donald Trump billions of dollars of taxpayers’ money will ultimately be made by … Donald Trump. I would say his chances are pretty good.The pattern is clear. Trump will do just enough to get through a damaging news cycle, wait for it to pass – then carry on as before. We saw the first half of that manoeuvre last week, which began withthreats to seize Greenlandand ended with those threatsseemingly withdrawnunder international and domestic fire. Nato and European leaders probably thought they’d seen off the danger. But this week Trump’s Greenland envoy was back demanding“total, unfettered access”to the island, so who knows what his boss might say next week.This is why I worry aboutthe deal struck late on Thursday by Senate Democrats, which saw the latter agree to keep funding the US government, thereby avoiding another shutdown, rather than withholding the cash until Trump meets their demands to “rein in” ICE. Now there will be two weeks of talks. The fear is that Democrats have let slip their moment of maximum leverage, when public outrage at ICE and CBP was at its peak, and will instead see the current anger fade. They will have walked right into Trump’s trap, as spelled out by the administration official whoadmittedthat this week’s “de-escalatory measures” were designed to placate Senate Democrats just enough that they failed to seize the moment.The lesson for those battling Trump, whether Democrats or nervous allies overseas, is not to celebrate an apparent climbdown too early. Instead, you resist until he retreats and, when he does, you don’t relax – you push even harder.Jonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionMinnesota ICE shootingsTrump administrationICE (US Immigration and Customs Enforcement)US politicscommentShareReuse this content"

When Brett Ratner’s contentious, Amazon-backed documentary previewed at the White House last weekend, the guestlist included Mike Tyson, Queen Rania of Jordan and the president himself. Today it’s just me in the room and Melania on the screen. It makes for a more intimate and exclusive affair.One adult for the 9.40am in Sittingbourne: a front row seat for Melania’s ominous UK openingRead moreThis mood of cosy conviviality extends all the way through the opening credits; at which point the chill descends and the novocaine kicks in, as the film’s star and executive producer proceeds to guide us – with agonising glacial slowness – through the preparations for her husband’s second presidential inauguration. She glides from the fashion fitting to the table setting, and from the “candlelit dinner” to the “starlight ball”, with a face like a fist and a voice of sheet metal. “Candlelight and black tie and my creative vision,” she says, as though listing the ingredients in a cauldron. “As first lady, children will always remain my priority,” she coos, and you can almost picture her coaxing them into her little gingerbread house.No doubt there is a great documentary to be made about Melania Knauss, the ambitious model from out of Slovenia who married a New York real-estate mogul and then found herself cast in the role of a latter-day Eva Braun, but the horrific Melania emphatically isn’t it. It’s one of those rare, unicorn films that doesn’t have a single redeeming quality. I’m not even sure it qualifies as a documentary, exactly, so much as an elaborate piece of designer taxidermy, horribly overpriced and ice-cold to the touch and proffered like a medieval tribute to placate the greedy king on his throne.And so it goes on. Melania moves through the action like a listless automaton, talking constantly but saying nothing, squired from Mar-a-Lago to Trump Tower to her final destination, the White House. What drama there is chiefly hinges on her concern that her white blouse is too loose at the neck and needs to be cut and then tightened, much to the consternation of the fitters. Melania misses her mother, she says, but she loves Michael Jackson and Barron and possibly her husband as well, although Trump himself is mostly a background presence here, shuffling in at intervals to brag about his election win and complain that his inauguration clashes with the televised college football playoffs. “They probably did it on purpose,” he says.Eggs, hats and unfettered ambition: what we learned about Melania Trump from her documentaryRead moreIt’s dispiriting, it’s deadly and it’s spectacularly unrevealing. Ratner’s film plays like a gilded trash remake of Jonathan Glazer’s The Zone of Interest in which a button-eyed Cinderella points at gold baubles and designer dresses, cunningly distracting us while her husband and his cronies prepare to dismantle the Constitution and asset-strip the federal government. “White and gold – that’s so you,” purrs one of her lickspittles as she busies herself with the colour-scheme for the ball and the incoming first lady allows that yes indeed, this is true.It’s no spoiler to reveal that phew, thank heavens, Trump’s second inauguration goes swimmingly well in the end. This despite the unfortunate clash with the college football game. This despite the infuriating looseness of the first lady’s white blouse. The preparations are exhausting but the euphoria of the moment sees her through, all the way to the starlight ball where she briefly boogies along to the Village People’s YMCA. “Being awake for 22-hours felt like nothing,” she gushes, which is nice to hear and good for her. But the fun’s not infectious and the guests are a nightmare, and two hours of Melania feels like pure, endless hell.Melania is out nowExplore more on these topicsMelaniaMelania TrumpreviewsShareReuse this content"

Jake’s marriage to Louise is in trouble, and she has insisted he come and see me. “If not for Louise, you wouldn’t be here, would you?” I enquire tentatively. He looks sheepish at first; then emboldened, he gives an emphatic “No.” As is almost always the case, Jake’s wife has registered a problem that has passed him by, and prompted his visit. Over the next few weeks, we sift through a maze of obstacles, and in the end, Jake is full of emotion: “I’m alone in the world, everyone leans on me, there’s no one for me,” he says. “There’s no one to turn to.”It’s a common pattern, one I’ve seen throughout my 35 years as a psychologist specialising in male mental health. Men make up only 33% of referrals to NHS talkingtherapies. They don’t come easily, and when they do seek help in a crisis, they can disappear as suddenly as they arrive. Yet male vulnerability is clear – men report lower levels of life satisfaction than women and make up three-quarters of suicides and problems withaddiction. But despite the increase in awareness around male mental health, men still tend to think there’s a stigma to speaking with a professional, even though most of those who havetried therapy have a positive experience.So why are men still so reluctant to talk? Here are the issues I see again and again.Men are primed for action rather than wordsHistorically, men’s roles centred on work and provision; women’s on caregiving, looking after the home and raising children. Today, men still tend to be more action-oriented and task-focused. This is partially hardwired – boys tend to lag behind girls inverbal and emotional attunement; women speakmore words in an average day.Action comes before the development of language; it is our mother tongue, and men tend to stick with this early way of communicating, which is shaped both by biology and the social context. When it comes to expressing distress, men find it more difficult to do so verbally. They are farless likely to say they are depressed or anxious; instead, they are prone to acting out when troubled. Without even realising why, they may find themselves driving too fast, getting into altercations, drinking or using pornography when they experience emotional difficulty.Therapy is ‘feminised’Women have been more likely to seek professional help in the form of talking therapies, and as a result therapy has developed through the female lens. Services are often “feminised” indesign, with an emphasis on talking directly about feelings, which can be uncomfortable for men, who tend to respond better to “shoulder-to-shoulder” conversations than face-to-face discussions.They often prefer group therapy for its sense of camaraderie and shared experience, allowing connection without being in the spotlight. Coaching and mentoring show promiseasmale-friendly approaches. I often find this with my patients: you begin by talking about their work setting – an area they feel comfortable discussing – and end up talking about more intimate personal struggles, because going straight into the personal is too threatening. Servicesworking with male veteranscombine activity such as walking and talking with traditional talk therapy. TheMen’s Sheds Association, which encourages people to come together to make, repair and repurpose, supporting projects in their communities, say that 89% of participants feel lessdepressedafter engaging with it.Showing vulnerability is risky in a hierarchyI’m struck by how many men come to see me as a milestone birthday approaches – when they’re 39 or 49, say. Reflecting on a reunion with old friends, one middle-aged patient told me: “What a relief – there was none of the competitiveness that made it so difficult to connect when we were younger. We can all relax now; we’ve got to where we’ve got to in life.” He said he could never have allowed himself to seek therapy earlier: “It would have been like exposing my belly to my adversary without my armour on.”The drive to strive is deeply encoded in men, and can stop us getting help when we’re down. Showing weakness feels hazardous when your position in the pecking order matters, and yet concealing it ultimately leads to greater fragility.Menare acutely shame-prone when it comes to showing vulnerability, fearing it will lower their status in the eyes of others.Science helps us make sense of this.Male infantsare more emotionally reactive than girls, less able to self-soothe, and more dependent on external regulation from caregivers. Yet we continue to expect boys to be more resilient, to show less emotion. The very infants we encourage to be robust are those most negatively affected when deprived of comfort.Therapy, which encourages emotional expression, can feel threatening when you’ve been raised to believe that showing your feelings is shameful. I have met many men who struggle with sexual dysfunction but feel unable to talk about it – sometimes avoiding relationships entirely rather than seeking help.And yet I cannot recall a single younger man who has regretted starting therapy. A safe therapeutic environment allows men to look at the behavioural patterns that limit them – and to begin to let them go.View image in fullscreenIllustration: Nathalie Lees/The GuardianThe age-old go-it-alone mentalityFrom the 19th-century novel centred on the buccaneer living a solitary existence to the modern cult of the “sigma male” (the online celebration of men who need no one), the legacy of “men going it alone” casts a long shadow. Therapy, by definition, begins with the client admitting they can’t do it all alone.The single most important thing that makes for a good life is strong, meaningful relationships; they are as important in predicting longevity as being anon-smoker. Yet men find it hard to step away from the powerful and harmful notion that there is safety in being solitary and self-sufficient.What happens in the therapy room? Gradually, men begin to test out the possibility that connection isn’t weakness but nourishment. The development of an authentic, connected relationship with their therapist proves it.Emotional claustrophobia“I don’t think I can keep it up,” says Marcus, referring to his fiancee’s wish to talk about their relationship. “I can do it for a bit, but then we keep going and going and I feel completely overwhelmed.” Later he admits that it makes him feel inadequate.With men, the expression of strong emotion can often only be tolerated in bitesize chunks. They are often raised to approach difficulties mechanically: identify, act, solve. This is helpful when the problem is practical, but when it is emotional they can become unstuck. Therapy, which requires patience and uncertainty, doesn’t fit this template. It may be necessary to provide men with a practical framework, such as specific techniques to manage symptoms of depression, panic attacks or other problems with anxiety (Why Has Nobody Told Me This Before?by Julie Smith is really useful for this).They wait until crisis pointMichael had been in a same-sex marriage for almost 30 years when he came to see me. Their sexual relationship was good to begin with, but there hadn’t been much intimacy for the past two decades. It hadn’t occurred to them to seek help, and Michael retreated deeper and deeper into using pornography and talking to strangers online. He felt alone and guilty, acutely depressed and desperate to be released from the prison he had created for himself. Michael’s husband discovered that he was researching methods to take his life and this brought him to my consulting room.On the whole, men tend to have less patience and want a quick fix. As a result, the threshold for action tends to be higher, and thus men will often allow things to fester and become worse before they seek help. A problem that might have been addressed earlier becomes overwhelming, and can lead to needless despair and suffering.A shortage of role modelsThere are exceptions – such as Stormzy, Prince Harry and the footballer Tyrone Mings – but media accounts of men in therapy often emerge when they are in crisis, such as when they go to rehab.Therapy is framed as a redemptive arc – a tidy solution to adversity. Men often come to therapy expecting immediate results, and need to be helped to let go of the fantasy of a swift remedy, learning instead to turn up, sit with vulnerability and allow progress to unfold in small, unheroic steps.We rarely see men discussing therapy as routine maintenance, the way we might talk about going to the gym or managing diet. Men are also considerably underrepresented in the psychological professions, including counselling and psychotherapy, which furthers the impression that these services are not suited to the needs of men and boys.‘I looked exceptional but I was out of breath’: the bodybuilder who switched to mindful movementRead moreFear of what they may findTherapy is about confronting the things we would prefer to avoid. It might uncover long-buried pain, guilt or grief. The fear that the whole structure might collapse if you start pulling on the threads is something everyone must overcome when they seek help, but it is particularly acute in men. They tend to feel deeply ashamed of their suffering, concealing it not just from others but from themselves.The paradox is that therapy doesn’t strip away strength – it redefines it. It offers a space where control can loosen without consequence, where emotions can be named rather than managed. The real challenge is cultural: masculinity links worth with resilience, while therapy still signals fragility.If you’re trying to help a man you care about take the first step, offer unpressured side-by-side connection and understanding, not instruction, advice or critique. And if you’re the man hesitating on the threshold, you don’t have to be at crisis point to seek support. It’s not self-indulgent to talk about yourself. Instead it helps you be less self-focused, and to concentrate on the things that really matter, to make good connections with those closest to you.Dr Stephen Blumenthal is a consultant clinical psychologist and psychoanalyst in the NHS and in private practiceExplore more on these topicsLife and styleMental healthHealthMen's healthSuicide ratesMenfeaturesShareReuse this content"

He made 89 appearances in the league, but 48 of them were from the bench and he was taken off 34 times. Having scored just 12 league goals in three years, he was nearly shipped off to Leeds in the summer.Fast-forward to today and he has become undroppable, starting 20 of Fulham’s 22 league games. Only four players have been involved in more goals than Wilson’s 12 this campaign – Erling Haaland (24), Igor Thiago (17), Bruno Fernandes (15) and Antoine Semenyo (13). Of those 12 goal involvements, 10 have come in his last 11 league appearances (six goals and four assists).The Welsh winger is the form player in the league and is increasingly the man Fulham turn to in big moments. When he stood over a free-kick in the 92nd minuteagainst Brighton last Saturdaythere was a hush over Craven Cottage and a strange sense of inevitability in the air. He stepped up, curled the ball into the top corner of the Brighton goal and turned a draw into a win.Delivering in big moments has become Wilson’s signature; without his contributions Fulham would be 12 points worse off this season. His eight goals have all been masterclasses in ball striking: from an audacious effort from the touchline at Spurs to his outside-of-the-boot finish against Palace that earned him December’s goal of the month. He has scored eight goals with an xG of just 3.81, giving him a +4.19 xG difference – the second highest in the league.Igor ThiagoIgor Thiago: ‘The only thing I know how to do in my life is score goals’Read moreFrombricklaying in Brazil to bullying centre-backsin the Premier League, Igor Thiago’s rise has been emphatic. Brentford signed him in the summer of 2024 to replace Ivan Toney, the club’s talismanic striker who scored 72 goals in 141 appearances, but Thiago’s first season was frustrating. Two knee injuries limited him to fleeting cameos and, by the time he returned to full fitness, he was filling a void that had grown larger with the departures ofYoane Wissa and Bryan Mbeumo, who scored 39 league goals between them for the club last season.Few expected him to carry that weight. Fewer still expected a player who spent his teenage years working manual jobs to support his family after the death of his father, laying bricks while chasing trials across Brazil, to become the focal point of aPremier Leagueside. Five months ago, the notion that Thiago would be chasing Erling Haaland for the Golden Boot would have been dismissed outright. But here we are, 23 games and 16 goals later.Thiago is the fourth-highest scorer in Europe’s top five leagues (behind Harry Kane, Kylian Mbappé and Haaland) and the top-scoring Brazilian. Carlo Ancelotti has some thinking to do before the World Cup.Antoine SemenyoAntoine Semenyo quit football when he was 15 years old. Rejected by Crystal Palace after a string of failed trials at Arsenal, Tottenham, Fulham and Millwall, he was convinced the dream was over and focused on basketball instead. But Semenyo returned to the game through a college programme, where his talent caught the eye and he was snapped up by Bristol City. He honed his craft during loan spells at Bath City, Newport County and Sunderland before tearing it up in the Championship.Bournemouth recognised his potential and paid £10m to bring him to the Premier League in January 2023. The player that Manchester City signed this month – powerful, direct, relentless in the press – took time to emerge. There were flashes of brilliance under Gary O’Neil, but it was during Andoni Iraola’s management that Semenyo became a star.The Ghana international hit double figures for goals in the Premier League last season and he began the current campaign with a bang, scoring twice at Anfield on the opening day. Since then, he has taken his game to another level, outpacing his expected goals by 4.36 (11 goals from an xG of 6.64), creating chances, carrying the ball at pace and terrorising full-backs on both flanks. He has attempted 78 dribbles (the seventh highest in the league), and he has taken 49 shots (the 10th most in the league).Defensively, he has been just as impactful, winning possession in the final third 18 times – the second most in the Premier League this season. “He has improved every single season,” said Cherries boss Iraola after Semenyo’s 10th and final goal for the club. “He has scored 10 goals in half a season and he’s not even a No 9.” He has already scored three goals in four games for City, further proof that the teenage reject was born for the biggest stage.View image in fullscreenAntoine Semenyo celebrates after scoring for Manchester City against Wolves.Photograph: Adam Vaughan/EPADominic Calvert-LewinNearly a decade has passed since a baby-faced Dominic Calvert-Lewin walked through the doors of Finch Farm. The striker joined Everton from Sheffield United for £1.5m on deadline day in August 2016 as a 19-year-old with heaps of potential.For a while it looked like a perfect match. Calvert-Lewin grew into the team and excelled for Everton after Romelu Lukaku’s departure to Manchester United for £75m. He reached his peak in the 2020–21 season when he scored 29 goals, but the momentum ebbed and injuries began to intrude. Just 12 goals in his last three seasons at Goodison Park left him drifting towards the margins.His contract came to an end and with it the closing of a chapter spent largely in physio rooms rather than opposition penalty boxes. The club seriously considered offering him one more chance to stay. Instead, Calvert-Lewin walked away, signing a three-year deal with Leeds.He was looking for a fresh start and he has found it. Calvert-Lewin has scored eight goals in his last 12 appearances and looks once more like the striker who earned 11 England caps. If this run continues, he might add more under Thomas Tuchel this summer.Jack GrealishWhenJack Grealish arrived at Manchester City for £100m in 2022, he was one football’s most exciting free-flowing forwards, a player who relied on improvisation and was shaped by risk and rhythm. Under Pep Guardiola’s guidance he enjoyed years of success, but also a period of subtle erosion.Grealish was moulded rather than unleashed at City. Danilo, a former City defender, once described Guardiola’s methods as “like being at university” where players were “brainwashed but in a good way”. Grealish became a willing student. His dribbles per game dropped by 40% in his first season and his freedom was exchanged for control. Trophies came in abundance – three league titles, the FA Cup and Champions League – but the Grealish of Villa Park, smiling and spontaneous, gradually slipped from view. And then he disappeared further, starting just seven league games last season. It felt as if the league had lost one of its brightest talents.Everton offered an escape route. He was joining a club that have been playing survival football for years. But Everton are no longer peering over their shoulder; they are playing with a certain degree of freedom under David Moyes – and Grealish has been handed the keys.His starting percentage is back up to the 75% mark he boasted at Villa and his impact has been significant. Grealish ranks third in the Premier League for assists (six); he has created 38 chances – more than any Everton player by a distance; and he recently scored his first goal from outside the box since November 2020 – a strike that was symbolic of his reborn confidence.“He’s been playing with a smile on his face again and he makes Evertonians smile,” said former midfielder Leon Osman, and it is hard to disagree. Hisinjury could not have come at worse timebut Everton fans will be hoping he extends his stay.This is an article byWhoScoredExplore more on these topicsPremier LeagueGuardian Sport NetworkfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It was really special and she was really nice,” said Di Dio.She said it was “mind-blowing” to realise she had cooked her richly flavoured bean and kale stew and unusual Neapolitan beef shin pasta for one of the world’s most famous musicians, though she acknowledged: “Margate is always full of opportunities.”Di Dio moved with her partner, Harry Ryder, to Margate a decade ago, priced out of London and Canterbury, and Di Dio said she spotted there was “already a buzz” in the town back then, but the pair have been astonished to witness its changing fortunes.View image in fullscreenSimona Di Dio and Harry Ryder found it ‘mind-blowing’ to be cooking for Madonna.Photograph: David Levene/The GuardianAs well as raving about her visit to Di Dio’s Cantina Caruso restaurant during a visit organised by the Turner prize-winning artist Tracey Emin,Madonna enthused about Margate on Instagram, describing the town as “heaven” and “energised by creativity”.While Di Dio and Ryder recognised Madonna’s depiction of Margate as filled with artists, musicians and performers – vocations shared by many of their staff members – they felt that it was important not to idealise the town, which has a sharp social and economic divide.‘My idea of heaven’: Madonna sings praises of artists’ paradise MargateRead moreNoting that the town has some of the most deprived postcodes in the UK, Ryder said: “It’s not all rosy. She didn’t see it all, she saw the art scene. Obviously there is a lot more to it.”But he added that although the influx of wealthier people and “DFLs” (Down From Londons) has been much maligned, lots of newer arrivals do want to contribute to the area.Among the projects aiming to bridge the divide between Margate’s “two towns” is the Perfect Place to Grow project, a cafe situated on the site of Tracey Emin’s TKE Studios which trains local 18 to 24-year-olds who are struggling to access sustainable employment.David Wilson, a chef and support worker who runs the kitchen, said: “Young people who try to engage with the Jobcentre and employment services locally are given very uninspiring options and we try to do the opposite of that.”Margate’s strong brand has given trainees the opportunity to work with celebrity chefs such as José Pizarro and Nathan Outlaw, he said.View image in fullscreenDavid Wilson runs the kitchen for the Perfect Place to Grow project.Photograph: David Levene/The GuardianMany local people have mixed feelings about Margate’s growing appeal to the rich and famous. Dan Thompson, an artist who has lived in the town for 20 years, moved in to what used to be one of the town’s “roughest streets”, but has been unable to keep up with prices rising as high-end galleries have moved in, and is now homeless and living with friends.He said this experience was shared by others in his cohort of DIY experimental artists who moved in in the early 2000s – with many having since relocated to Dover in search of cheaper rents.View image in fullscreenArtist Dan Thompson is a longtime Margate resident.Photograph: David Levene/The GuardianBut he acknowledged that there have been “massive spillover benefits” from the town’s recent gentrification for some – for example, local tradesmen have profited from the increased demand for their services.He is curating an exhibition that opens next week called Lost Margate, which looks at the way different waves of arrivals have rewritten Margate’s story.View image in fullscreenConnor Sansby is a poet who incorporates Margate’s seascape into his work.Photograph: David Levene/The Guardian“For 300 years, it has only existed to take money from Londoners, so has always reinvented itself,” he said. “People absolutely love this place, and every generation that comes in falls in love with it for a slightly different reason.”Connor Sansby, a poet who has lived in Margate his whole life, is contributing a work to the exhibition, which uses the seaside town’s waves as a metaphor for gentrification, in which new arrivals erase that which existed before.Labour MPs call for action to tackle deprivation in coastal ‘sea wall’ seatsRead more“Margate has become a place of two halves. It’s two places occupying the same space,” he said, noting that the new art world has “splintered” from local creatives.“They’re not interacting with the Margate native population, so they don’t understand some of the issues,” he said, citing the battle over a Greggs takeaway opening as a symbol for the disconnection between people who need affordable food options and those who do not.Despite this, Sansby agreed with Madonna’s assessment: “It does occasionally feel like an absolute dream. There’s a culture and a community of people who’ve been here the whole time, and we are all fantastic.”Margate’s shabby high street is often seen as exemplifying the town that is being left behind amid the boutiques, restaurants and art galleries opening up in its old town.Leo Kilburn-Long, who works in the McDonald’s on the street, said he appreciated how Margate’s changing fortunes have led to “new stuff popping up recently” to reverse the high street’s decline.View image in fullscreenLeo Kilburn-Long is one of many people in Margate worried about the cost of living.Photograph: David Levene/The GuardianBut he viewed gentrification as a double-edged sword: “Cost of living down here is ridiculous, you have to spend an arm and a leg to even afford a little room in somebody’s gaff,” he said. “Margate is a great place to go visit, but to stay down here is so expensive.”Amy Holbourne, who works on the high street, hoped that Madonna’s enthusiastic post may “help bring a lot of business to the town”.But she said believed that rising housing prices had resulted in growing homelessness and drug addiction.View image in fullscreenAmy Holbourne feels Margate is improving.Photograph: David Levene/The GuardianHer niece, who has three children, has been on a social housing waiting list for three years and has been living with her grandfather. “There’s just no housing round here,” she said. “The council need to really sort it out.”Asked if she too would describe Margate as “heaven”, she said: “I live here, I wouldn’t describe it as that … but it’s improving.”Explore more on these topicsGentrificationKentUK cost of living crisisTracey EminMadonnafeaturesShareReuse this content"

Epstein had served 13 months of an 18-month sentence for soliciting prostitution from a minor, for which he was registered as a sex offender. Mandelson was business secretary at the time and in a relationship with da Silva. The pair married in 2023 after 27 years together.Da Silva asked Epstein to fund an osteopathy course and other expenses, saying: “I sent you a couple of emails last week regarding my osteo course expenses, incl fee, anatomical models, laptop if you can help me with this. I hope you received them.“I just managed to speak to the fees office at the osteo school and confirmed that my annual fee is of £3,225 … They accept bank transfer and the details are as follows.”Epstein responded later that day and said: “I will wire your loan amount immediated’y [sic].”View image in fullscreenAn email that was included in the US Department of Justice release of its Jeffrey Epstein files.Photograph: Jon Elswick/APThe next day, Da Silva emailed Epstein again to ask if a £10,000 payment included his school fees or if that amount had been transferred to the school itself. Epstein responded: “includedd” [sic].After da Silva sent details about his course, to which Epstein said he would “wire the loan amount”, Mandelson emailed Epstein saying: “Remind him that to avoid a gift-tax filing it must be a loan.”Da Silva emailed Epstein on 17 September and said: “thank you for the money which arrived in my account this morning”.Da Silva messaged Epstein again in April 2010 and shared his bank details, according to the Financial Times which first reported the allegations. Epstein reportedly forwarded the email to his accountant and said: “send 13k dollars”. He later instructed his accountant to “send 2k per month to reinaldo” [sic].View image in fullscreenJeffrey Epstein pleaded guilty, in 2008, to a charge of procuring for prostitution a girl below the age of 18.Photograph: US Justice Department/ReutersAn email from Epstein to Mandelson on 19 July 2009 suggested the financier had met da Silva while serving the last few days of his prison sentence for soliciting prostitution. Epstein had served most of his sentence in a work-release programme that allowed him to leave jail during the day to go to his office, then return at night.In the email Epstein said: “you didn’t call me ,„ i spent an hour with rinaldo.. call me tomorrow.. at office.”Mandelson responded: “I was immersed in Afghanistan … thanks for talking to Reinaldo. It did him (therefore me) a lot of good. You now see the problems. I cannot talk to him about these things at all, he won’t listen. I am doing Sunday media then will call. Thanks again xxx.”Epstein replied: “I as always am there.”Mandelson said on Friday: “I was wrong to believe Epstein following his conviction and to continue my association with him afterwards. I apologise unequivocally for doing so to the women and girls who suffered.“I was never culpable or complicit in his crimes. Like everyone else I learned the actual truth about him after his death.“But his victims did know what he was doing, their voices were not heard and I am sorry I was among those who believed him over them.”Earlier this month,Mandelson apologised for his association with Epstein. The latest batch of documents show Epstein and Mandelson were in frequent contact, often sending each other short messages about their whereabouts.Emails released in November by the House oversight committee, which is conducting an inquiry into the US government’s handling of the Epstein case, revealed Mandelson and Epstein were still in contact in 2016.Explore more on these topicsPeter MandelsonJeffrey EpsteinLabournewsShareReuse this content"

Emails in the files appear to show the two cordially messaging each other on two separate occasions to make plans for Musk to visitEpstein’s island.The documents include Musk and Epstein emailing in both 2012 and 2013 to determine when Musk should make the trip to Little St James. Neither exchanges appear to have resulted in Musk visiting the island, due to logistical issues.“Will be in the BVI/St Bart’s area over the holidays. Is there a good time to visit?” Musk states on 13 December 2013.“any day 1st - 8th . play it by ear if you want. always space for you,” Epstein replies.Musk then sends several emails relaying his schedule, and the two settle on 2 January as a date for the visit. The email exchange ends with Epstein telling Musk that he would need to remain in New York and sending his regrets that they could not meet.“Bad news- Unfortunately , my schedule will keep me in New York . I was really looking forward to finally spending some time together with just fun as the agenda. so i am very disappointed. Hopefully we can schedule another time in the near future,” Epstein wrote.US justice department releases more than 3 million new pages of Epstein filesRead moreIn November 2012, Epstein sent Musk an email asking “how many people will you be for the heli to island”.“Probably just Talulah and me. What day/night will be the wildest party on your island?” Musk replied, in an apparent reference to his former wife Talulah Riley.Musk followed up with an email on 25 December in response to another Epstein message that encouraged him to visit and offered use of his helicopter.“Do you have any parties planned? I’ve been working to the edge of sanity this year and so, once my kids head home after Christmas, I really want to hit the party scene in St Barts or elsewhere and let loose. The invitation is much appreciated, but a peaceful island experience is the opposite of what I’m looking for,” Musk wrote.“Understood , I will see you on st Barth, the ratio on my island might make Talilah uncomfortable,” Epstein responded.“Ratio is not a problem for Talulah,” Musk said.On 2 January 2013, Musk sent Epstein an email suggesting that the visit wouldn’t take place saying: “Logistics won’t work this time around.”Musk has been harshly critical of those linked to Epstein, but the newly released emails appear to contradict his own longstanding denial of any ties of his own. The Tesla CEOtoldVanity Fair in 2019 that Epstein was “obviously a creep” and claimed that Epstein “tried repeatedly to get me to visit his island. I declined.” The emails between the two moguls come years after Epstein was convicted in 2008 of soliciting prostitution from a minor in Florida. Authorities later arrested Epstein in 2019 on federal sex-trafficking charges.A separate email in the documents shows Epstein’s longtime assistant Lesley Groff appearing to make plans for Epstein to have lunch at SpaceX in 2013, stating: “Elon Musk appreciates the invitation to the Ranch but has commitments… Lunch on Monday Feb.25th at 1pm at Space X is confirmed”. It is unclear whether the lunch took place or whether Musk was in attendance. Yet another series of exchanges from March 2013 features Epstein and Musk emailing back and forth after Epstein sends him congratulations a day after a SpaceX rocket launch.A representative for Musk and his artificial intelligence company, xAI, did not immediately return a request for comment.The newly released emails between Musk and Epstein, who wasfound deadin his prison cell in 2019 and for years has been the subject of speculation over his connections to some of the world’s most powerful people, are part of a tranche of 3 million documents that the justice department made public on Friday.Musk has faced pressure to address any potential connection to Epstein in the past, including after an earlier justice department release of documents related to the investigationmentioned his name. House Democrats last year released a copy of Epstein’s daily schedule, which showed a calendar entry from 2014 that states “Reminder: Elon Musk to island Dec. 6 (is this still happening?)”. No other information was included, and Musk denied making plans for the visit in a post on X.“This is false,” he wrote in response to a post that mentioned the allegations.Musk has also denied knowing Epstein’s longtime co-conspirator Ghislaine Maxwell,claimingthat a much-circulated photo of the two of them together at an event was because she “photobombed” him at a Vanity Fair party. Muskstatedthat he once visited Epstein’s Manhattan apartment “for about 30 minutes” with his ex-wife Talulah Riley as part of research for a book she was writing, but did not specify an exact date.While he has denied a personal connection to Epstein, Musk has invoked the sex offender’s name to attack others. He claimed during hispublic falling-outwith Donald Trump last year that the president’s name was in the Epstein files. He laterappeared to delete his postson X accusing Trump of ties to Epstein. Musk alsoinsultedfellow tech mogul Bill Gates in May over the Microsoft founder’s relationship with Epstein, lashing out after Gatescriticizedhim for cuts to humanitarian aid.“Who does Bill Gates think he is to make comments about the welfare of children given that he frequentedJeffrey Epstein?” Musk said.Explore more on these topicsElon MuskJeffrey EpsteinnewsShareReuse this content"

During the visit, Mountbatten-Windsor and Epstein were pictured walking together in Central Park.The former prince said in his disastrous Newsnight interview in 2019 that he chose to meet Epstein in person to end the friendship as he felt breaking the news “over the telephone was the chicken’s way of doing it”.However, newly released emails indicate that Siegal drew up a guest list for what she described as a “very interesting, fast, fun dinner” involving Mountbatten-Windsor and Epstein.She invited the film director Woody Allen and his wife, Soon-Yi Previn; the political strategist George Stephanopoulos and his wife, the actor Alexandra Wentworth; the journalist Katie Couric and the talkshow host Charlie Rose. It is not clear who ultimately attended, but the emails suggest Wentworth withdrew because her children were sick.In the emails, Siegal told Stephanopoulos: “Come on time and you will have private time with Andrew as he is staying at the house.”Separate emails between Epstein and an account named “The Duke” on 11 and 12 August 2010 suggest the financier wanted to introduce “A” to a 26-year-old Russian woman, whom he suggested he “might enjoy having dinner with”.Epstein wrote that the woman would be in London in August 2010. “The Duke” replied that he would be in Geneva “until the morning of the 22nd but would be delighted to see her” and then asked: “Will she be bringing a message from you? Please give her my contact details to get in touch.”The email is signed “A”, with what appears to be an email signature that reads “HRH Duke of York KG”.The person asked Epstein whether there was “any other information you might know about her that might be useful to know?”, to which he replied: “she 26, russian, clevere beautiful, trustworthy and yes she has your email”.In another email released, Epstein’s accomplice, the British socialiteGhislaine Maxwell, addressed a sender who calls themselves “The Invisible Man” as “Andrew”, and referred to “Sarah and the kids”.An email exchange from August 2002 shows the two accounts talking about organising a weekend together on “the Island” only for the Invisible Man to decline, with Maxwell suggesting “5 stunning red heads” would be there.Epstein killed himself in prison in 2019 as he faced fresh child sexual abuse charges. Mountbatten-Windsor has withdrawn from royal life and been stripped of his titles over his links to Epstein.In 2022, he paid a reported £12m settlement to Virginia Giuffre. Giuffre, who killed herself last April, claimed she was forced to have sex with Mountbatten-Windsor after being trafficked to him by Epstein. He has always strenuously denied these allegations and made the payment without admitting liability.The files released on Friday also show that Maxwell sent an email to the Invisible Man expressing her condolences on the loss of his grandmother, the queen mother, who died in 2002.It read: “Sweat pea – sorry you had to rush home, and also under such sad circumstances.

Does Sunday evening for dinner sound good?”An individual whose name is redactedreplied: “Below from Jeffrey: come sat or sunday lunch? little st james on the map, behind christmans cove.”The documents appear to suggest that a meeting took place, as on 24 December, Epstein emailed his assistant with the subject line: “please forward to howard lutnik”.The email body reads: “nice seeing you, read #2 dot three.” The assistantresponds“Will do!” and thenforwardsthe message to Lutnick.On Friday, theNew York Timesreached Lutnick by phone and Lutnick said he could not comment about the island visit because he had not seen the latest tranche of Epstein documents.“I spent zero time with him,” Lutnick said before ending the call.Also among the newly released tranche of files related to Epstein are documents suggesting Lutnick invited Epstein to a fundraiser for Hilary Clinton in 2015.The document includes anemaildated 3 November 2015 in which Epstein’s longtime assistant forwarded him an email from Lutnick, the former CEO of the financial firm Cantor Fitzgerald, with an invitation to a “very =ntimate [sic] fundraising event”for Hillary Clinton on 11 November.Per the document, Epstein’s assistant forwarded the invitation email to Epstein that same day.It is unclear whether Epstein attended the event.At the time, the New York Postreportedon a fundraiser that month held at Lutnick’s home, which the paper described as being “next door to Jeffrey Epstein’s house”. It is not clear if it was the same event.These new documents come after Lutnick acknowledged in a podcastinterview withthe New York Post’s Miranda Devine that Epstein was his neighbor, and recounted that in 2005 Epstein invited Lutnick and his wife into his home, and gave them a tour.“Big living room, and then across from it is double doors, I assume it’s the dining room, and he opens the doors and there’s a massage table in the middle of the room, and candles all around and stuff,” Lutnick said. “I say to him, ‘Massage table in the middle of your house? How often you have a massage?’ And he says, ‘Every day.’ And then he like gets, like, weirdly close to me and he says, ‘And the right kind of massage.’“Now, my wife is standing here, so she looks at me and I look at her and we say, ‘I’m sorry, we have to go,’” Lutnick continued. “And we left, and in the six or eight steps it takes to get from his house to my house, my wife and I decided that I will never be in the room with that disgusting person ever again. So I was never in the room with him socially, for business, or even philanthropy. If that guy was there, I wasn’t going, cause he’s gross.”The commerce department did not immediately respond to a comment request from the Guardian regarding the 2015 email.Cantor declined to comment about the 2015 fundraiser to the Guardian.Explore more on these topicsJeffrey EpsteinTrump administrationUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

He said: “I know that the action taken in relation to our parliamentarians has been a real cause of concern, understandably so.“And therefore I raised that issue whilst I was here, and the Chinese are absolutely clear in response: the restrictions no longer apply. President Xi said to me that that means all parliamentarians are welcome.“I think that shows that if you engage, you can raise the difficult issues, the issues that my parliamentary colleagues would have expected me to raise, and therefore I can be clear, the restrictions no longer apply.”The affected MPs and peers said they would not stop speaking out against human rights abuses, including the targeting of the minority Uyghur Muslim community in Xinjiang province.They also said the “selective lifting of sanctions solely on sitting parliamentarians is wrong”. An academic, a barrister and a former Tory MP who were also sanctioned appear to remain subject to the measures, possibly including their families.Starmeropened the door to a UK visitfrom Xi after the talks in Beijing on Thursday. However, it would have been politically challenging to do so while the sanctions remained in place. Chinese diplomats are banned from parliament after a spying row.Starmer suggested on Friday that Xi would be welcome in the UK when it hosted the G20 summit next year. “We are hosting the G20 in 2027. China is a G20 country. So of course I’d like to see President Xi come around the G20.”The prime minister was forced to downplay comments made overnight by Donald Trump about the supposed perils of dealing with Beijing. The US president is due to visit China himself in April.Asked about Starmer’s visit, Trump told reporters: “Well, it’s very dangerous for them to do that, and it’s even more dangerous, I think, for Canada to get into business with China.” Last week, Trumpthreatened to level tariffs on Canadaif it made a trade deal with China.Asked about Trump’s view, Starmer told Sky News from Shanghai: “I’ve seen President Trump’s comments. I think, to be fair, he was probably talking more about Canada than the United Kingdom.”China’s sanctions on the British citizens were a retaliationagainst theUK imposing sanctions on Chinese officialsheld responsible for atrocities in Xinjiang. It is understood that those will not be lifted in return.The five MPs put under sanctions in 2021 were the former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith, Tom Tugendhat, Nusrat Ghani, Neil O’Brien and Tim Loughton, who stood down in 2024.The two peers were David Alton, a crossbencher, and Helena Kennedy, from Labour. Several are members of the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China.Before the move was confirmed, the seven parliamentarians issued a statement. “We would rather remain under sanction indefinitely than have our status used as a bargaining chip to justify lifting British sanctions on those officials responsible for the genocide in Xinjiang,” they said.“We would reject any deal that prioritises our personal convenience over the pursuit of justice for the Uyghur people. We stand in total solidarity with our families, former colleagues, and the civil society organisations who remain targeted by the People’s Republic of China.”The Newcastle University academic Dr Jo Smith Finley, whose research focuses on theUyghurs, and Geoffrey Nice KC, who chaired the Uyghur tribunal that investigated atrocities against the minority group, remain under sanctions.All nine were banned from entering China, Hong Kong and Macau, any property they had in China was frozen, and Chinese citizens and institutions were prohibited from doing business with them.The direct impact of the sanctions on the parliamentarians was limited, although there have been suggestions they may have faced intimidation and espionage. The symbolism, however, was significant as relations between China and the UK were at a low ebb.In April, China lifted its sanctions on five MEPs and on the European parliament’s subcommittee on human rights, which were also imposed in 2021 in response to the EU’s own sanctions.The move was part of Beijing’s charm offensive to improve ties andrevive talks over a trade deal with Brussels, amid the turmoil caused by Trump’s tariffs.Explore more on these topicsChinaForeign policyConservativesHouse of LordsUyghursKeir StarmerAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

Hitting military sites? It is unclear what a US attack on Iran would achievePatrick WintourDiplomatic editorFri 30 Jan 2026 13.38 ESTFirst published on Fri 30 Jan 2026 05.59 ESTShareDonald Trump has said he believes Tehran wants to make a deal to head off a regional conflict, as he claimed the US “armada” near Iran was bigger than the task force deployed to topple Venezuela’s leader.“We have a large armada, flotilla, call it whatever you want, heading towardIranright now, even larger than what we had in Venezuela,” the US president told reporters on Friday.“Hopefully we’ll make a deal. If we do make a deal, that’s good. If we don’t make a deal, we’ll see what happens.”He declined to say whether he planned a repeat of the military operation in Venezuela in which US forces captured and renditioned the president, Nicolás Maduro.“I don’t want to talk about anything having to do with what I’m doing militarily,” he said.His comments came after Iran’s foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi said Tehran was ready to negotiate with the US, but only if talks were not under duress and did not extend to Iran’s missile programme.After meetings with Turkish diplomats, Araghchi said Iran was “ready to begin negotiations if they take place on an equal footing, based on mutual interests and mutual respect”. He said there were no immediate plans to meet US officials, adding: “I want to state firmly that Iran’s defensive and missile capabilities will never be subject to negotiation.”Araghchi said: “The Islamic Republic of Iran, just as it is ready for negotiations, is also ready for war.”Trump said on Thursdayhe hoped to avoid military action, even as the US deployed another warship to the Middle East, joining the USS Abraham Lincoln and several guided-missile destroyers.View image in fullscreenIran’s foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi (left), with his Turkish counterpart, Hakan Fidan, in Istanbul on Friday.Photograph: Turkish foreign ministry/ReutersBut his precise objectives remain unclear. Speaking at the premiere of the documentaryMelania, the US president told reporters Iran had to do “two things” to avoid military action. “Number one, no nuclear. And number two, stop killing protesters,” saying that “they are killing them by the thousands”.He added: “We have a lot of very big, very powerful ships sailing to Iran right now, and it would be great if we didn’t have to use them.”Iran has blamed the US and Israel for the protests that erupted in late December over economic grievances, and were brutally suppressed. Activist groups estimate as many as 30,000 people were killed in the ensuing crackdown.‘Deeply ideological’: the rationale behind Iran’s insistence on uranium enrichmentRead moreThe Turkish foreign minister, Hakan Fidan, said the resumption of talks between Tehran and Washington over Iran’s nuclear programme was “vital for reducing regional tensions”. Speaking alongside Araghchi, he claimed Israel was pushing for the US to attack Iran, and urged Washington to “act with common sense and not allow this to happen”.In a call with Iran’s president, Masoud Pezeshkian, Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, said he was willing to act as a mediator between Iran and the US.From Iran’s perspective, the US is piling ever more demands on Tehran that if all were implemented would spell the end of its sovereignty.Trump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff has called for an end to Iran’s nuclear enrichment programme, the transfer of its existing stock of highly enriched uranium out of the country, limits on Iran’s missile programme and an end to support for proxy groups in countries such as Lebanon, Iraq and Yemen.Araghchi held separate phone calls with his counterparts from Qatar, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, Oman and Turkey. All the Arab states have insisted their air ground facilities cannot be used by the US to attack Iran.In Turkey, Araghchi criticisedThursday’s decisionby the EU, likely to be followed by the UK, to proscribe the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) as a terrorist organisation.He said: “The truth is that Europe is a declining continent and has lost its role on the international level and is losing it more and more every day, and it is surprising that they themselves are fuelling this process. This shows that Europe has neither a correct understanding of the international situation, nor a correct understanding of the conditions in our region, nor a correct understanding of its own interests. The decision they made was a major strategic mistake.”Araghchi did not spell out what reprisals were being considered, but the UK Foreign Office has always worried such a move would lead Iran to break off diplomatic relations. But Ali Larijani, the secretary of Iran’s national security council, said in future Tehran would treat the armies of Europe as terrorists.The Iranian supreme leader’s representative in the IRGC said the European action would have serious consequences for the EU.On Friday, the US followed the EU in imposing sanctions against Iran’s interior minister, accusing Eskandar Momeni of repressing the nationwide protests. The sanctions come as anger grows inside Iran that the supposedly reformist government allowed such large-scale killings.In a statement, the Reform Front, a reformist umbrella body, called for “an independent fact-finding committee to investigate this unprecedented disaster and present a transparent and candid report to the Iranian nation”.It also called on the judiciary to refrain from “hasty rulings” against detainees, and said bereaved families must be allowed to freely mourn protesters who were killed in the crackdown.Explore more on these topicsIranDonald TrumpUS foreign policyMiddle East and north AfricaIran's nuclear programmenewsShareReuse this content"

He isn’t welcome in the party.”But Labour, which is seeking to present itself as the only viable leftwing option for votes against Reform in theGreater Manchesterconstituency, said Robinson’s intervention showed that “the stakes couldn’t be higher” for the 26 February contest.“Tommy Robinson’s endorsement of Reform’s candidate shows who he really is and what he stands for,” aLabourcampaign spokesperson said.“The Greens simply cannot win this byelection, leaving a stark choice between unity and change with Labour, or division and risk with Reform.“Only a vote for Labour can stop the toxic politics that Reform and Tommy Robinson would bring toManchester.”The Greens, whounveiled their candidateon Friday, argue in turn that Labour’s polling woes and its decision not to allow Andy Burnham, the Greater Manchester mayor, to stand in the seat, mean they are the most credible opponent for Reform.But according to a Labour internal memo, prepared for Downing Street, the party has received encouraging messages from door-knocking so far, with what was described as a “strong” rate of people pledging to vote Labour, and less support for the Green party.The memo goes on to say that Labour mobilisation of volunteers has been more rapid “than any previous byelection the party has fought in recent years” and that the campaign has had an “incredibly strong start”.Goodwin, 44, a former academic who is now a GB News presenter and hard-right activist, was a controversial choice to represent Reform in the byelection, particularly afterhe claimed recentlythat UK-born people from minority ethnic backgrounds were not necessarily British.Speakingat an eventin Denton on Tuesday at which he was unveiled as the Reform candidate, Goodwin twice declined to answer when asked by the Guardian whether he stood by the views. He hadalso said: “It takes more than a piece of paper to make somebody ‘British’.”Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, first came to notoriety as leader of the English Defence League, an anti-Islam street group based initially around fellow football fans in his home town of Luton.He has been convicted of criminal offences including assault, mortgage fraud and using a false passport. In 2018 he wasmade an adviserto Gerard Batten, the then leader of Ukip, prompting Farageto quitthe party he had led for years.Since Robinson’s X account was reinstated under Elon Musk’s ownership of the platform, he has gained prominence, including in the US, presenting himself as a self-styled journalist and campaigner, although the bulk of his content is far-right material targeting immigrants and Muslims.His increased profile was highlighted last September when a “unite the kingdom” protest he organised was attended bybetween 110,000 and 150,000 people.Explore more on these topicsReform UKLabourByelectionsGreater ManchesterManchesternewsShareReuse this content"

It means we’re looking at video, talking to witnesses, trying to understand what happened.” The justice department has not opened such an investigation into Good’s death.View image in fullscreenA national guard vehicle during a protest outside the Bishop Henry Whipple federal building, just south of Minneapolis, Minnesota, on 30 January.Photograph: Shannon Stapleton/ReutersProtesters have gathered daily across parts of the Twin Cities for weeks. Friday was no exception.“The community is really rallied, and I think it’s important just to stand with them and have more people on the streets,” said Ann Pelsue, 58, who made the three-hour journey from Iron River, Wisconsin, to join demonstrators outside a federal building in a Minneapolis suburb where many people targeted in the immigration raids, as well as protesters andobservers who monitorfederal enforcement actions, are taken and held.Meanwhile, the homeland security secretary,Kristi Noem, first disclosed the shift in which agency was leading the investigation into Pretti’s death during aFox News interviewon Thursday evening.Noem also conceded that she may have gotten some information wrong in her initial response to Pretti’s shooting, when she held a press conference last Saturday and repeated allegations made by other officials that Pretti had been attacking officers – a narrativequickly and clearlycontradicted by bystandervideo of him being shotas well assworn witness testimony.“We were being relayed information from on the ground from CBP agents and officers that were there,” Noem said in Thursday’s TV interview. The Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agency includes border patrol, with both alongside ICEunder the umbrellaof the DHS.Noem described to Fox a “very chaotic” situation, when the host asked whether her responses last Saturday had been “premature”.But the Trump administration had rushed in to blame Pretti.Greg Bovino, then commander of border patrol’s operation who wasmoved outof Minneapolis days later, said the nursewanted to “massacre”federal officers, and numerous officials, including Noem, called Prettia “domestic terrorist”. The administration had also quickly mischaracterized thecore of what happenedwhen Good was shot,infuriatinglocal leaders and many communities.Noem has been facing calls to resign amid widespread and mounting outrage, evenamong some Republicans. The North Carolina Republican senator Thom Tillistoldreporters that Noem’s conduct “should be disqualifying”.Videos of Pretti’s shooting showed that he had his mobile phone in his hand as officers tackled him to the ground after he tried to shield a fellow protester and he did not appear to touch or reach for the gun he had a permit to carry.Two other videos emerged this week of an earlier altercation between Pretti and federal immigration officers11 days before his death.The videos from 13 January show Pretti yelling at federal vehicles and at one point appearing to spit before kicking out the taillight of one vehicle. A struggle ensues between Pretti and several officers, during which he is forced to the ground.2:48Alex Pretti kicks tail light of federal agent's vehicle before confrontation – videoSteve Schleicher, a Minneapolis-based attorney representing Pretti’s parents, said the earlier altercation in no way justified officers fatally shooting Pretti more than a week later.In a stark post on his Truth Social platform early on Friday morning, Donald Trump suggested that the videos of the earlier incident undercut the narrative that Pretti was a peaceful protester when he was shot.“Agitator and, perhaps, insurrectionist, Alex Pretti’s stock has gone way down with the just released video of him screaming and spitting in the face of a very calm and under control ICE officer, and then crazily kicking in a new and very expensive government vehicle, so hard and violent, in fact, that the taillight broke off in pieces,” the US president’s post said. It added: “It was quite a display of abuse and anger, for all to see, crazed and out of control.”Later on Friday, protesters gathered outside the Bishop Henry Whipple building just south of Minneapolis, the federal building and holding center that has become the site of many demonstrations.Dozens of people held up placards in Arctic temperatures, reading “ICE out now” and “Minnesota strong” while a chorus of whistles blared and cries of “shame” erupted when protesters spotted federal law enforcement enter the facility in their cars on Friday. Supporters set up stands, doling out hand warmers and energy bars to those braving the frigid weather to protest.Minneapolis ICE watchers face violence, teargas and arrests.

Minnesota has been showing up ever since they started taking their neighbors,” he said.Trump’s “border czar”, Tom Homan, was sent, over Noem’s head, to Minneapolis to replace Bovino earlier this week.“Regardless of who is at the top right now, this is about the fact that you’re not following the rule of law,” said Caleb Dunnewind, 23, another protester, who lives just four blocks away from where Pretti was fatally shot, of federal officials’ conduct.Tim Walz, Minnesota governor, and Jacob Frey, mayor of Minneapolis, both Democrats, have voiced public fury over the federal shootings and “invasion” by federal officials.The Associated Press contributed reporting.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationMinnesota ICE shootingsUS justice systemFBIUS politicsMinnesotaMinneapolisnewsShareReuse this content"

The site, where local people dig manually for a few dollars a day, has been under the control of the M23 rebel group since 2024.The collapse occurred on Wednesday and the precise toll was still unclear as of Friday evening.“More than 200 people were victims of this landslide, including miners, children and market women. Some people were rescued just in time and have serious injuries,” Muyisa said.An adviser to the governor said the number of confirmed dead was at least 227. He spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorised to brief the media.The UN says M23 has plundered Rubaya’s riches to help fund its insurgency, backed by the government of neighbouring Rwanda – an allegation Kigali denies.The heavily armed rebels, whose stated aim is to overthrow the government in Kinshasa and ensure the safety of the Congolese Tutsi minority,captured even more mineral-rich territory in eastern Congoduring a lightning advance last year.Explore more on these topicsDemocratic Republic of the CongoAfricaMiningnewsShareReuse this content"

Video of officers at the scene having restrained Zinn circulated widely online, leading some to believe that he was the conservative political activist’s killer.But, after experiencing an unspecified medical episode and being brought to a hospital, Zinn allegedly told officers he was “glad he said he shot the individual so the real suspect could get away”, police documents said. He also purportedly said he had illicit child sexual abuse material on his cellphone, so he was worried about investigators looking at the device.Authorities subsequently charged Zinn with second-degree obstruction of justice as well as various counts of sexual exploitation of minors. The latter counts were connected to more than 20 images depicting child sexual abuse, including of minors believed to be between five and 12 years old – along with explicit messages sharing the imagery with others.On Thursday, in front of Utah state court judge Thomas Low, Zinn pleaded no contest to a reduced, third-degree obstruction charge related to the events at UVU. Zinn additionally pleaded guilty to two of the sexual exploitation of minors counts.Low sentenced Zinn to up to five years in prison for the obstruction plea. The other plea got Zinn one to 15 years in prison, as Utah news outletsKSLandABC 4first reported.It is ultimately up to a state parole board to determine how long Zinn is going to remain imprisoned, Utah’s Salt Lake Tribunewrote.Zinn’s history of criminal charges and convictions in Utah reportedly dates back three decades. Notably, days after the deadly Boston Marathon terrorist bombing in 2013, he was arrested for allegedly asking Salt Lake City, Utah, marathon organizers if they needed help setting up bombs at the finish line.Utah state prosecutors charged Tyler Robinson with aggravated murder in Kirk’s killing, which was one of several prominent instances of political violence in the US in 2025. Prosecutors have said they plan to seek the death penalty against Robinson, who has pleaded not guilty.Explore more on these topicsCharlie Kirk shootingUtahUS crimenewsShareReuse this content"

She added, of the experience: “It was lovely. All those kids that played our children were just lovely.”O’Hara recentlyappearedat Culkin’s Hollywood Walk of Fame ceremony, wiping away tears as she praised him.Culkin paid tribute to O’Hara onInstagram, writing: “Mama.

I’ll see you later.”She began working with Christopher Guest in 1996, starring in the mockumentary Waiting for Guffman, and starred in three more of his films: Best in Show, A Mighty Wind and For Your Consideration in 2006.Guest praised O’Hara for her ability to master comedy and drama in their last collaboration together. “Catherine is one of not many actresses that can pull off both sides of this, where she’s incredibly funny but can also shift into an emotional area that surprises people and it’s just amazing, that transition,”he said.Catherine O’Hara: a life in picturesRead moreO’Hara also provided her voice for many animated films including Chicken Little, Over the Hedge, Monster House, Frankenweenie and, most recently, The Wild Robot.View image in fullscreenCatherine O’Hara in Schitt’s Creek.Photograph: APOn the small screen, she had roles in The Larry Sanders Show, Six Feet Under, Curb Your Enthusiasm and 30 Rock before she reunited with another Guest actor, Eugene Levy, for the hit sitcom Schitt’s Creek.“It’s always more fun working with someone you know,” she said to theGuardianin 2021. “I get too nervous doing solo bits – it’s too much pressure and it feels like showing off.

The state pays hagmar salaries, but in effect they operate in parallel to regular battalions.Yaakov*, who served as a reservist in the occupied West Bank in 2024,described the hagmar as “armed militias doing what they want”.“Formally they are under the battalion commander and his deputy, but on the ground they are given a free hand,” he said, speaking on condition of anonymity. “The senior command looks the other way when incidents happen. They don’t respond to any command.”His unit was often called to incidents by Israeli activists supporting Palestinians. When they arrived, they usually found settler reservists already at the scene, sometimes joining attacks on Palestinians.“Most of the time, when something happened the hagmar would arrive ahead of us … Sometimes we arrived together with them, it was very rare we preceded them,” Yaakov said. “When they do arrive, in the best case, the hagmar do not participate. In the worst case, they are together with the settlers.”He said he witnessed daily violence including vandalism of houses, trees, fruit, and agricultural produce, theft of livestock, intimidation and careless weapons handling.View image in fullscreenIsraeli forces block Palestinian farmers harvesting olives in Sa’ir, near Hebron.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesIn other areas hagmar forces have been implicated in more extreme violence, including last yearkillingan elderly Palestinian man, andrunning overanother Palestinian with an all-terrain vehicle.The hagmar system had led to “the establishment of what are effectively settler militias within the IDF’s own ranks”, said Nadav Weiman, the executive director of Breaking the Silence, an advocacy group for former Israeli soldiers. “These soldier-settlers are driven by a violent, zero-sum ideology, and have all the authority of regular IDF soldiers to put that ideology into action.”The Israeli military said there had been “a few incidents in which regional defence unit reservists acted in ways that did not meet expected standards”, but they “do not represent the majority of regional defence unit reservists”.Some reservists have been removed from duty, and in other cases criminal investigations have been opened, a spokesperson said.Since October 2023, Israeli soldiers have been indicted in connection with three violent offences and three property offences in the occupied West Bank, rights group Yesh Din said. Israeli forces have killed over 1000 Palestinians in that period. The last attack that led to a homicide indictment was a 2019 shooting.There is a long history of close collaboration between settlers and the Israeli military. Units in the West Bank regularlykilledand injuredcivilians,includingchildren, and failed to enforce laws protecting Palestinians from settler violence.But the widespread deployment of settler units marked a profound structural change. “Post 7 October [2023] the military and settler are unified,” said Yehuda Shaul, co-director of the Ofek thinktank, which campaigns against Israel’s occupation, and a co-founder of Breaking the Silence.“The settlers are the IDF, the IDF are settlers, there’s no pretence of a buffer,” he said. “It is not any more about a situation where the IDF are standing idly by while settlers attack, it’s not even just one or two soldiers joining settler attacks.“It’s a level of complicity that goes beyond anything we have seen before. You can see the impact if you look at how many Palestinian communities were forcibly transferred by settler violence before 7 October, and how many after.”Settler attacks have completely displaced 29 Palestinian communities since October 2023, more than one a month on average, UN datashows. In 2022 and the first nine months of 2023, four communities were displaced, or one every five months.The UN warned this month that the “growing phenomenon of ‘settler-soldiers’ … is further blurring the line between state and settler violence”. Settlers had killed, destroyed property and livelihoods, forced Palestinians from their homes and ripped communities apart, a report from the office of the high commissioner for human rights found.The creation of hagmar units enabled these attacks and “further cemented” impunity for perpetrators, the report noted. A shifting mix of military uniform and civilian clothes meant “there is no clarity on whether Israeli attackers are acting as part of the army or in their private capacity”.A second Israeli soldier deployed to the occupied West Bank in 2025 described an irregular dress code that amplified the “vigilante feel” of hagmar units. Moshe* spoke to the Guardian in an interview arranged by Breaking the Silence and also asked to remain anonymous.“When you see the hagmar with uniform, they’re quite identifiable because this is the only people out there that aren’t us.” But they did not always wear uniforms, even when going on military missions, he added. “In the West Bank [there] is a very confusing mix of people, some in full uniform, some in part uniform but with long-barrel weapons, or wearing something like cargo pants that are military-esque but not necessarily a proper uniform.”Your browser doesn't support HTML5 video. Here is alink to the videoinstead.Nahum, who is driving a car with a civilian license plate, changes into Israeli military uniform – videoIn September last year, a hagmar member, Elyashiv Nahum, approached international activists in Masafer Yatta, demanding to see their passports. He was driving a civilian vehicle, and wearing civilian clothes so the activists asked what legal authority he had to demand documents, video of the incident showed. Nahum then changed into uniform and called a commander who told the women: “It doesn’t matter what he looks like. He’s a soldier and he has the authority.”Even serving Israeli soldiers often struggle to identify the chain of command for armed settlers because of the irregular approach to uniforms and a proliferation of weapons in the West Bank since October 2023.Your browser doesn't support HTML5 video. Here is alink to the videoinstead.'He’s a soldier and he has the authority': soldier and commander on phone confront activist – videoAssault rifles are issued to hagmar and members of “first defender” security groups at settlements, and the government has also loosened gun licensing laws.In the first year of the war, about 120,000 weapons were handed out to “Israeli citizens”, the far-right security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, said in a post on X.Yaakov described being called to an incident where a well-known settler wearing military trousers was waving a military-issue weapon with dangerous aggression and carelessness. He did not know whether the man was a fellow soldier from a hagmar unit, a first responder with an assault rifle, or a civilian with a borrowed gun.The Israeli military said hagmar reservists “are required to operate in uniform and follow clear procedures under the supervision of regional units”. They are also required to follow all IDF orders and rules of engagement. “Any deviation from these rules is investigated and addressed,” a military spokesperson said.Regular forces deployed to the West Bank were not briefed on the hagmar’s membership or division of military roles between units in the area, both reservists who spoke to the Guardian said. That was “very unusual when there are other forces in the same area as you”, Moshe said.They came to recognise many serving settlers over months of deployment, however, as the two groups built relationships that Yaakov described as “transgressing the operational”.All settlements keep a “warm corner” with coffee and biscuits for soldiers far from home. Hagmar soldiers often invite other reservists, who are often bored and lonely, to watch football or join Friday night dinner, creating close bonds.The hagmar units are not new. The structure was created decades ago, envisaged as a backup line of defence in border kibbutzim and communities to be activated in wars or at times of heightened threat.But after the 7 October 2023 Hamas-led attacks, as Israel prepared to send the conscripts and career officers of the standing army to fight in Gaza, hagmar reservists were activated at a scale and for a duration that was unprecedented in Israel’s history.Thousands were called up to units in border communities, an Israeli military spokesperson said. The number of serving hagmar reservists has been cut by 85% since then but hundreds are still deployed, most of them in the occupied West Bank. The military declined to give exact figures, but Israeli media reported that 7,000 settlers were initially mobilised to the units, and in December 2025 at least 500 were still based at illegal farm outposts.Conventional reservist units outnumbered the hagmar in the West Bank, but the settlers’ presence was felt much more strongly on the ground, both soldiers said.Their familiarity with local terrain often means soldiers on temporary deployments seek their advice or defer to their decisions. “Even the senior officers don’t really know what’s going on, so they treat the hagmar as the people that know the area and know how to deal with stuff,” Moshe said.View image in fullscreenA Palestinian farmer and foreign volunteers flee as the Israeli army throws teargas canisters as they harvest olive groves near Ramallah in the West Bank.Photograph: Zain Jaafar/AFP/Getty ImagesAt times this extends to hagmar having effective command authority over uniformed reservists on the ground. In August, Nahum, the settler filmed changing into a uniform, drove to a small Bedouin community with several regular reservists in his pickup, although travelling in a civilian vehicle while on duty would usually violate Israeli military regulations.When the group arrived Nahum, who was in civilian clothes, began directing the reservists to search Palestinian property and look for international activists, according to an Israeli activist present at the time and a soldier serving in the area. “I wouldn’t say he was giving orders like an army commander, but he was in charge,” the activist said, speaking on condition of anonymity over fears of professional repercussions for work protecting Palestinians.“You saw that he would talk with the soldiers, he would talk with the officers, and then in the end what he wanted, that would happen.”Even when a higher-ranking officer, a lieutenant colonel, arrived on the scene, it was “obvious that this guy was telling the soldiers what to do and what to say. Even the lieutenant colonel.”Yaakov, who had served in the West Bank before, said the presence of hagmar units caused an obvious escalation in attacks on Palestinians and their homes and property. “It was very clear that the friction is higher, and the friction between specifically those hagmar units which are new after 7 October and the Palestinians was much more intense,” he said. It was also clear the escalation was caused by Israelis.“It’s not that Palestinians came to the settlement, the settlement came to them,” he said. “The settlers were bringing their sheep to graze at the area of the [Palestinian] village. It was very obvious that the Palestinians were the side that could not fight back.”He did not know at the time that Israeli soldiers had the authority to arrest Israelis, and only witnessed the detention of Palestinians.“The violent conduct came only from one side. Arresting them would have stopped the pogroms, the Palestinians were not armed or violent and the risk to life came from the settlers.”Hagmar recruits include men with a criminal record for violence, who now conduct their campaigns backed by the authority of the Israeli state, Shaul said.“Israel has taken some of the most extreme settlers, in some cases people who are even convicted of assault against Palestinians, and made them the IDF.“They have been given the power to run the show in the area where they live, to carry out their plans, dreams, fantasies – depending on how far they went – through formal service in the IDF.”* Names have been changedExplore more on these topicsWest BankPalestineIsraelMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

O’Hara, known for her distinctively brassy yet malleable trill of her voice and her frequently red hair, peels back her performer’s bravado to expose the frenzied need beneath it. She somehow plays the outsized beneath the regular-sized, as her Marilyn Hack goes from plugging-away workhorse to desperate striver. Unsurprisingly, O’Hara briefly generated awards buzz of her own for playing this part; even less surprisingly, an Oscar nomination was not forthcoming. It couldn’t be; otherwise, it might have marred O’Hara’s masterclass in how certain actors, especially those specializing in comedy, are destined to go under-recognized in their lifetimes.The difference, of course, is that Marilyn Hack is depicted by O’Hara, with tragicomic precision, as a mediocrity. O’Hara, who passed away today at the age of 71, was not. She was exceptional, and within her reputation as a primarily comic actress, she possessed an extraordinary range. She was the best-case scenario of a performer trained in sketch comedy, able to slip into various characters and render them instantly vivid.View image in fullscreenA still from Schitt’s Creek.Photograph: PictureLux/The Hollywood Archive/AlamyThere are nonetheless signature roles and projects for O’Hara, in television and film. There was SCTV, for which she shared a writing Emmy, and her late-career renaissance brought about by her work as Moira Rose on Schitt’s Creek, for which she won a leading actress in a comedy Emmy that pretty much the entire world agreed was richly deserved. In between those pillars, she was an in-demand character actor and constant TV guest star. She’s particularly indelible to generations of kids for playing the frazzled but ultimately dedicated mom in Home Alone and its sequel, serving as the true emotional heart of the original film. She stole scenes in eventual classics such as After Hours and The Paper, hits like Dick Tracy, bombs like Wyatt Earp, and countless comic and voiceover roles. But the two major film collaborations of her career were with her SCTV pal Guest and Tim Burton.For Guest, O’Hara did flawless teamwork in his mostly mockumentary movies Waiting for Guffman, Best in Show, A Mighty Wind, and For Your Consideration. Guffman and Consideration make for poetic but unsparing bookends; the former ends with O’Hara and her on-screen husband Fred Willard leaving small town Missouri to pursue work as film extras in Los Angeles, while Consideration finds O’Hara’s Marilyn butting up against the limitations of her career, with O’Hara doing a virtuosic bit of fake-plastic-surgery acting. Guest makes wonderful meta-text of O’Hara’s genuine dexterity as a performer; she plays a former folk singer in A Mighty Wind, whose breakup with her long-time partner (Eugene Levy) causes his mental breakdown. She’s also paired with Levy for Best in Show, where she’s also (believably) portrayed as more vivacious than her milquetoast beau. Despite the common ground her characters in the Guest films share, they aren’t just comic archetypes, but distinctive people.Her characters with Burton are equally nuanced, no small feat in such stylized environments. The pair didn’t collaborate as frequently as Burton and Johnny Depp or Danny DeVito, but she was there for one of his biggest breakthroughs, playing artist Delia Deetz, mother to melancholy goth girl Lydia (Winona Ryder), in Beetlejuice, and new caretaker of a house haunted by its sweet-natured former occupants. O’Hara makes Delia somewhat villainous in her garish sculptures and house-wrecking postmodern tastes, as well as her lack of understanding for her daughter; she is also, unquestionably, the heroine of her own story. O’Hara satirizes art-world pretension without sacrificing her innate comic likability. You want to see what this confidently untalented woman gets up to, even as it seems natural for a pair of ghosts to take point on parenting her daughter.View image in fullscreenA still from Beetlejuice.Photograph: Allstar Picture Library Ltd/AlamyShe reteamed with Burton for his animation project The Nightmare Before Christmas, where she provided multiple voices, most notably for female lead Sally, a wistful, stitched-together ragdoll in love with Christmas-besotted Halloween planner Jack Skellington. Though Jack’s singing and speaking parts were divided between two performers, O’Hara did her own singing as Sally, and occasionally performed Sally’s Song in concert later in her career. Given the more clipped, brassy tone she was best-known for in comedies, her work as Sally, a soulful wallflower and twisted vine of yearning, is pretty stunning; you’d never guess it was her.Both Burton movies were echoed later in her career: for Frankenweenie, Burton’s stop-motion animated adaptation of his own short film, O’Hara again provided multiple voices, equally adept at playing a caring mom and a character referred to only as “weird girl”. And for his 2024 legacy sequel Beetlejuice Beetlejuice, O’Hara reprised Delia Deetz – and made her, if anything, more endearing than ever as a still-talent-deficient-but-now-quite-successful artist who loses her husband, subsequently dies in an absurd snake accident, and searches the underworld for her beloved. It’s a perfect turn for O’Hara because she seemed so indefatigable; what other comic actor could be so funny grappling with her own literal mortality and deciding she has her own post-life goal to attain? It didn’t much matter that Burton no longer had the services of her former on-screen partner Jeffrey Jones; O’Hara made Delia as funny as ever and weirdly touching, too.It may be a tough performance to rewatch in the coming days, now that O’Hara is actually gone, far too soon. Then again, maybe not; it’s difficult to watch just about any Catherine O’Hara performance, even the more serious ones, and not feel delighted by her presence. She made big, crazy, sometimes potentially abrasive characters such welcome company.Explore more on these topicsCatherine O'HaraTelevisionSchitt's CreekComedycommentShareReuse this content"

Her 90-year-old mother, who has lived with her for more than 40 years due to various disabilities, shares the house with Martinez, 65, her adult daughter, aged 25, and her granddaughter, aged three months. “My mum has lived with me literally all my adult life,” she says. “She just wasn’t able to live by herself.”The household also includes Martinez’s best friend of more than three decades, who originally moved in “for a few months” after a divorce. That was 25 years ago. “I could not have raised my daughter as a single mother without her,” Martinez says. When her friend, now aged 79, was diagnosed with breast cancer a few years after moving in, the arrangement became permanent. “There was no point in her leaving,” she says. “By then she was an integral part of our household.” Her friend is now “Tía” (auntie in Spanish) to her children and grandchildren, a role Martinez says reflects how deeply friendship can function as family.Earlier this year, Martinez’s daughter moved back home when she became pregnant, adding another generation to the household. “How many grandparents can say they get to hold their grandchild every day?” she says. “It’s a blessing.” While the house can be busy and hectic, it’s also “a lot of fun” and Martinez says having multiple adults around makes life easier emotionally and practically. “There’s always someone to say: are you OK? Is there something you need?” she says. “You don’t have that if you live alone.”Martinez has always lived this way and can’t imagine doing otherwise. “It can be harder work – or maybe just different work,” she says, particularly when living with friends rather than relatives. But she believes the benefits outweigh the challenges. “It keeps me young and it keeps me connected,” she says. “Living like this keeps us all on a more even keel than any one of us would be alone.”‘The real thing that’s held us together is how we party’In rural Germany, Tracey Kelliher, a 48-year-old Irish musician who has lived in Berlin for 17 years, is part of a group of three couples who bought an old farmhouse together despite barely knowing one another. The idea of communal living had been something she had long imagined for the future, but the coronavirus pandemic accelerated the decision. “We really followed our gut,” she says. “I’m a calculated risk-taker – not a lunatic – but this just felt right.” What began as a practical choice, driven by affordability and a desire not to do it alone, quickly became something deeper.Before committing, however, Kelliher and her girlfriend, Wallis, had serious reservations. “We had a bit of a panic moment,” she says. “My way of dealing with it was: I need more information. I basically needed to see into the future.” It was only after a group conversation, where others acknowledged the scale of the leap, that she felt able to move forward. “They said: this is scary. It’s a scary decision,” she says. “And even if it doesn’t work out, everything’s going to be OK. That was all we needed to hear.”When they first got the keys, the house had no heating and no running water. “We’d be wearing ski suits indoors,” Kelliher says. “You could tell the temperature by how much you could see your breath.” The group spent their early months chopping wood, tending fires and collecting water together – conditions she describes as unexpectedly bonding. “Even that was kind of team building,” she says. “You become a family really quickly when you’re living like that.” Although she had initially imagined needing strict private space, she found herself loving the intimacy. “The communal way of living was a gift I never knew I wanted.”What surprised her most, however, was how the group really cemented their bond. She assumed it would be through the renovation or shared artistic interests. “But actually the real thing that’s held us together is how we party,” she says. Evenings around the fire became central to their life together. “We sing together – we didn’t know that beforehand. It turns out we can all sing. We’re doing four-part harmonies, dancing around the fire, with a guitar or music on.” She describes it as the “glue” that turned a practical arrangement into a family. “That’s what solidified us.”Friends and family, particularly those back in Ireland, were concerned when they heard the idea, she says, often focusing on what might go wrong – even though many admitted they longed for the same thing. “Almost everybody wants it,” Kelliher says. “People know isolation isn’t the way forward.”The group, who all maintain homes in Berlin and split their time between the city and the farm, put significant effort into making the arrangement work on paper as well as emotionally. Unable to secure a group mortgage, they set up a company and drew up contracts covering everything from inheritance to what would happen if couples broke up. “For me, that’s perfect,” Kelliher says. “It means I don’t ever have to think about it. It’s done.” Over time, formal meetings gave way to more organic decision-making, underpinned by trust. “What makes it work is that we put other people before ourselves,” she says. “There’s no malice – if something comes up, you just say it.”Now, four years on, the renovation is nearing completion, with separate living spaces and shared communal areas. Their biggest concern, Kelliher says, is not conflict but distance. “Our worry is that we might end up spending less time together – and none of us want that.”‘My son has grown up seeing that friends can be like family’In Bristol in the UK, Natalie Bennett lives with her 10-year-old son Ruben and his father, Aaron, her longtime friend with whom she has never been in a romantic relationship. When Bennett fell pregnant unexpectedly, they decided to do things differently and moved in together despite only being friends. “I didn’t want all the parenting to fall on my shoulders as a single parent. I wanted to see if we could do things differently and parent as friends,” Bennett says. After initially living together for two years, they separated households for several years before moving back in together when Aaron’s flatmate decided to move out, and he realised it was going to be difficult to rent alone with a child.Living together again, she says, has made day-to-day life easier and less isolating. They split bills and childcare, share cooking and bedtimes and even co-own their home, even though their finances remain separate. “It’s not that different from parenting as a couple,” she says. “We get the benefits of that without being in a romantic relationship.” The arrangement has also meant her son no longer moves between two homes and they all get to see more of each other.Their household is also shaped by friendship. Bennett’s close friend Alex – who previously lived with her son and his father – also lives with them two nights a week, helping with childcare and cooking. His support is invaluable, Bennett says, describing it as the village everyone talks about needing when you first have a child. “My son’s grown up seeing that friends can be like family.”Bennett, who is doing a PhD on single parents with important non-romantic relationships, believes these kinds of platonic relationships are often undervalued, particularly when it comes to raising children.Bennett says the biggest challenge has been navigating social expectations. “People assume you’re meant to be hostile if you co-parent or that romance is the only real intimacy,” she says. But living this way has changed how she thinks about family and support. “I think people would be less lonely if they felt able to expect more from their friendships.”‘We kept noticing little ways to help each other out’Sara Anastazia, 47, and her friend, Mia, moved in with their respective children when both women were going through a divorce.“We began sharing a beautiful, big, five-bedroom home in 2023,” says Sara, who is a community strategist and lives in Philadelphia. “It was a temporary six-month let while the owner was abroad. At the time, my kids were 14 and 16, and Mia’s were 12 and five. It was incredibly helpful to live with another mom. We kept noticing little ways to help each other out and support each other, like with the laundry, getting ready for school, food shopping, chores and sharing meals. Our costs went down tremendously, and we both like to cook, so we would enjoy meals together.”She says they agreed to some very loose ground rules, but they “trusted each other” and it worked out.When the owner of the house returned, Sara and Mia, who is a cook and culinary educator, and their families moved out. “We went our separate ways for about a year, but we were still in touch,” says Sara. “Then in August of 2025, we lucked out and found an upstairs-downstairs rental.”Sara now lives in the two-bedroom downstairs with her son, 19, who stays two or three times a week. Her other son, 16, joins them for dinner from Sunday through to Thursday. Mia lives in the four-bedroom accommodation upstairs with her children, who are 14 and seven. “We share meals together one to two nights a week,” she says. “Our kids know each other a lot better now, and we all made cookies together at Christmas. We share the yard, and this spring we’re looking forward to gardening. Coffee and tea mornings together are my joy. We also hold regular work sessions and have worked together hosting events.” They keep costs down by sharing the internet and car insurance.Sara and Mia feel very strongly about inspiring other women who may be going through divorce or a relationship break-up.“It is very important to both of us that we can support women in our local community who are trying to navigate difficult situations,” she says, with them letting women stay when they have the room.“That is a priority for us. We really want to inspire other women who are trying to extricate themselves [from a relationship] and show the creative ways to do this.”She says of their living arrangement: “I highly recommend this strategy for anyone exiting a relationship.”‘I can’t imagine a better place to raise a child’A conversation Peter Reimer had as an undergraduate with one of their favourite professors about housing cooperatives spurred them to investigate this living arrangement when they moved to Chicago.“I found one, was interviewed and got a spot,” says Peter, 31, a data analyst. “I have been living in this co-op since 2018, but have moved houses within it. When I moved in, I put down a one-month security deposit and a membership charge of around $35.”Peter met their partner in 2018 at a co-op dinner. They are married and now have a two-year-old with another child on the way. They live in a 22-person house. For the first year and a half of their child’s life, they had just one room, but now they rent a second room and hope to rent another in the future, though they will have to wait until someone moves out before one becomes available.“As membership turns over, we can rent more rooms without moving, so it’s a lot less hassle,” says Peter, who adds that the support network of the house has been hugely helpful as they bring up their child.“My partner works remotely as a therapist, and sometimes she needs exclusive access to the room,” they say. “We are doing some co-parenting with some of our housemates, so we always had somewhere for the kid to nap when my partner was working.”Their rent gets them a room in the co-op and access to the common spaces. Depending on the size of the room, Peter says you can expect to pay between $500 and $800 a month, which is cheaper than the going rate for studios and one-bedroom apartments in Chicago.“At the co-op you have a room, access to a large kitchen, a big dining room, common spaces, a bike room and a big yard, but they’re not just yours – you’re sharing them with other people,” they say.Rent includes the water bill and maintenance of the house. The housemates pay for electricity, heating, internet, their food, a rainy-day fund and an education fund, and the cost for all these is between $200 and $240 a month, depending on means.In Peter’s house, there is one room with an en-suite bathroom, and the remaining 21 people share six bathrooms. Everyone in the house is expected to do chores, including cooking and cleaning, totalling about five and a half hours a week.“I can’t imagine a better place to raise a child,” says Peter. “It’s cheap, the common spaces are way bigger than I could afford living on my own, and I love living with people. The community, solidarity and mutual aid within the house are unparalleled. The only price is more time on meetings and figuring out living compromises, but it’s a small price to pay.”Explore more on these topicsWell actuallyFamilyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Having built strong contacts within the Conservative party, he had already been assisting the hereditary peer James Bethell, and Tim Montgomerie, previously chief of staff to Iain Duncan Smith as Tory leader and the founder of the influential ConservativeHome website, on a campaign with the strapline “there is nothing British about the BNP”.Goodwin’s co-authored report to Tameside council identified the areas “most ‘at risk’ of far-right extremism and the factors that have driven this support”. The paper argued that it was largely white neighbourhoods close to areas of high immigration where fears might be fruitfully played upon by the extremists.“The underlying logic is that citizens turn to the far right as part of an instrumental attempt to ‘defend’ their neighbourhood from threatening groups nearby, and to maintain its characteristics and demographic composition,” the paper advised, according to a copy seen by the Guardian.Fifteen years later, Goodwin’s attentions have returned to Tameside, having been announced on Tuesday as the Reform candidate in Gorton and Denton’s upcoming byelection.It is Goodwin though, according to his political opponents, who is the extremist at the gate now. A recent post on his Substack screamed: “Trump is right – Europe is facing ‘civilisational erasure’ Having spent much time recently in Paris, Brussels, and London, I for one can say these are not the cities I once knew – they are becoming something else entirely.”In a recent podcast, Goodwin told his interviewer: “2063 is the year in which white Britons become a minority in the country. If a child is born today, by the time they turn 25 they will likely be a minority among their peers … I think it matters for lots of reasons: one is more diverse societies are also less trusting societies.”Few of those who knew Goodwin early in his academic career would have predicted his metamorphosis from ambitious centre-right academic to apparent proponent of ethno-nationalism. A Reform source said he was simply highlighting the consequences of a “policy of mass uncontrolled immigration which nobody voted for”. But were there straws in the wind for this rightward shift?He could be “great fun to be around” but “loved to be the centre of attention … any group of people that gives him the time of day, he gets very excited by,” said one contemporary at the University of Manchester where Goodwin landed his first post-doctoral role. His nickname then was Two Jacks after he excitedly blurted out the contents of his poker hand during a night out with colleagues in a casino.His PhD on the BNP, completed while at the University of Bath, was described by one contemporary as “really quite a brave project – he basically went deep with all the activists who are the kind of people who, if they take against you, you can end up in hospital”.One of those Goodwin interviewed for what would become a book was Eddy Butler, a senior BNP figure who spearheaded its “Rights for Whites” campaign.Butler published a review he had written of Goodwin’s New British Fascism: Rise of the British National Party on his blog in 2011. “I suspect he has an element of empathy with the aims if not the means by which organised nationalism has gone about realising these aims,” Butler opined of Goodwin. “Perhaps the hours of interviews he has undertaken has had a Stockholm syndrome effect.”These comments were dismissed by a Reform source: “We could just as easily point to what radical extremist activists have said about the Green party or the Labour party in recent years.”But did Goodwin have a talent for winning the trust of his interviewees or was he vulnerable to ideological capture? Certainly he managed to tease out fresh information from Nigel Farage for a second book he co-authored with Robert Ford, a friend from Manchester, entitled Revolt on the Right.The then Ukip leader revealed to Goodwin that his party’s executive committee had held a vote in 2008 on whether to form a pact with the BNP for European elections, leading to the first of a number of front page headlines for the authors.View image in fullscreenGoodwin with Nigel Farage during a campaign visit to Gorton and Denton in Manchester.Photograph: Jon Super/APAt the book’s launch event at Chatham House, Goodwin arranged for Farage to join him on stage. Ford was told two hours before the event that he would not be able to sit with them, which a Goodwin ally said was because Ford was not affiliated to the institute. The ally also said any criticism from former colleagues was motivated by jealousy at Goodwin’s “impact and influence on the national debate”.A certain ruthlessness then, perhaps, but if Goodwin was showing any signs of leaning towards the politics of Farage or something more extreme, it bypassed senior Conservatives.Among those who gave him their time were Ameet Gill, David Cameron’s director of strategy, who brought Goodwin into Downing Street for a tour and talks, and Sayeeda Warsi, who was co-chair of the Conservative party from 2010-12 and invited Goodwin to join her governmentworking group on anti-Muslim hatred.Lady Warsi said she had no inkling that Goodwin, who at that time complained of the “worrying levels of public hostility” to Muslims, could end up taking selfies with Donald Trump’s former confidant Steve Bannon and writing that “millions of British Muslims – millions of our fellow citizens – hold views that are fundamentally opposed to British values and ways of life”.Warsi said: “Matt talked passionately and deeply about his concerns about the rise of the far right; as passionately as he now talks about Muslims, he talked then about Islamophobes. That is as honest as I can be really.”Goodwin quit Warsi’s advisory group in 2015, claiming that the work on tackling Islamophobia was not going quickly enough, although he had also complained that a request for a “paltry sum” of £5,000 to pay for researchers had been rejected.A hard worker but also obsessive, Goodwin, 44, was said by former friends and colleagues to have a track record of taking criticism and rejection badly, as evidenced by a string of broken relationships.He fell out with Ford after criticism of Goodwin’s generous forecasts for Ukip’s future electoral success led to wider concerns in academia by 2020 that Goodwin was becoming an activist.Montgomerie, who has also recently joined Reform, tweeted in 2024 that “there really is something sulphurous about Matt Goodwin. Incendiary views. Suspect opinion polls. Massive self-obsession. British public life would be so much better without him.” Montgomerie has since retracted his comments, the Guardian understands.Jonathan Portes, a former government economist, was a fellow with Goodwin at the UK in a Changing Europe thinktank but their relationship fell apart after a row on social media.“Recently we did a public debate on immigration,” said Portes. “It was me and [the immigration policy specialist] Zoe Gardner debating [the former Tory cabinet minister and new Reform member] Nadhim Zahawi and Matt,” he said. “I chatted with Nadhim but I didn’t chat with Matt before or after. We are not at the point where we talk to each other. He went from being a Reform sympathiser to very explicit racism.”Goodwin has said those who have falsely accused him of racism are smearing him for his audacity in opening a debate. A Reform source claimed Portes was a “deeply biased leftwing activist masquerading as an academic”.Goodwin left academia in the summer of 2024 when he took voluntary severance as a professor at the University of Kent. He is now aGB Newspresenter with a Substack that boasts 90,000 subscribers.He wrote a book on higher education last year, titledBad Education, which claimed British universities had been captured by “woke” ideas. Colleagues wonder whether the book might have been partly motivated by his failure to land the plum roles he is said to have coveted at Oxford and elsewhere. The suggestion was rejected by a person close to Goodwin as “nonsense”.“Matt has always talked about the dangers of hate and public intolerance in society,” a Reform spokesperson said. “Throughout his academic career he has pointed to working class areas being left behind by globalisation, mass immigration and an unresponsive political class in Westminster.”A former friend of Goodwin responded: “I think ego is the best explanation of his journey. It’s vanity, he is very brittle and insecure. The one thing I can’t answer is how much of this is performative and how much sincere. But at a certain point it doesn’t matter when you are telling hateful people, hateful things.”On Friday afternoon, the far-right agitator Tommy Robinson, a former BNP member, tweeted: “Vote Matt.”Explore more on these topicsReform UKByelectionsGB NewsGreater ManchesterprofilesShareReuse this content"

In concert with festival authorities in Rotterdam, she has secured cash and commissioned short films on the subject of displacement from five directors – including Mohammad Rasoulof, now in exile from his native Iran due to his pro-democracy activism, in effect making his first public statement since the recent massacres and apparently expressing his fears that he may never go home again.The films are far from solemnly earnest – this is an anthology of five brilliant miniature artworks. By turns shocking, funny, confessional and deeply mysterious, this is a tremendous collection; the constituent films of which benefit in some enigmatic way from being shown together. What Ealing Studios’s Dead of Night did for scariness, these films may have done for 21st-century exile.Ukrainian film-maker Maryna Er Gorbach shows us, in her film Rotation, a young Ukrainian woman eerily alone in a wheat field shot in saturated colour, answering questions from a disembodied voice about her former life in uniform. A flashback gives us a sense of her experience in combat, displaced from her civilian existence into the stress and fear of warfare. Then, in the present tense, she appears to succumb to a disturbing, apocalyptic vision.Super Afghan Gym by director Shahrbanoo Sadat is a very likable comedy about women of all ages who gather semi-surreptitiously in a Kabul gym to hang out and work out – rather like Nell Dunn’s stage-play Steaming (later filmed by Joseph Losey). It is inspired by the director’s own experience of pumping iron in Kabul; bizarrely surrounded by photos of hugely stacked near-naked guys, these fully clothed women exercise earnestly, some by hoisting toddlers up and down, the way the guys do with weights (no question of steroids here). They talk about the way women don’t feel at home in their own bodies.The horror of war inSyriaand the subsequent ordeal of boredom in a refugee hotel in London is the subject of Allies in Exile, by the Syrian directors Hasan Kattan and Fadi Al-Halabi; juxtaposing footage shot on iPhone in the hotel, which at one stage is surrounded by anti-refugee protesters, with terrifying footage shot years before in the ruins of Aleppo. The film focuses on the poignant friendship between Kattan and Al-Halabi (also the camera operator), whose own personal loss is all but unbearable.View image in fullscreenOmar Abdi in Whispers of a Burning Scent.Photograph: Displacement Film FundPerhaps the most purely mysterious is Somali-Austrian film-maker Mo Harawe’s Whispers of a Burning Scent. A young keyboard-player in a Mogadishu wedding band is arrested for fraud, for marrying a 75-year-old woman with dementia and selling some of her property. But is he the predatory villain he seems? And what happened to the money?Finally there is Rasoulof’s Sense of Water, an agonising account of an exiled Iranian writer in Germany (which may or may not be where Rasoulof is himself based), who falls in love with his translator and fellow Iranian expat. He cannot come to terms with what it means to become fluent in German and possibly lose his Farsi. Will he translate himself out of existence?The films all bristle with intensity and life – each has the ambition and accomplishment of a feature. They are a collective hit for this festival.Displacement Film Fund screened at theRotterdam film festival.Explore more on these topicsFilmShort filmsDrama filmsCate BlanchettIranAfghanistanSyriareviewsShareReuse this content"

But a muddled approach has led to indecision and paralysisFri 30 Jan 2026 09.17 ESTLast modified on Fri 30 Jan 2026 11.48 ESTShareAlong time ago, in a galaxy far, far away,Star Warswas an actual movie that people watched. It drew people to cinemas in huge numbers, largely because it was completely unembarrassed about being a pulpy space adventure about comic wizards and laser swords. Nowadays, it is something else entirely. A TV show about a likable space dad and his cute, cheeky, telekinetically powered adopted alien son, or perhaps a divisive culture-war bellwether that vacillates between trying to destroy itself in a blaze of operatic self-importance and hamfistedly rebuilding itself.These days Star Wars also seems mainly to be press releases and announcements, throwaway comments in interviews that gesture mournfully towards what once was and what might, one day, be again. Which brings us to Taika Waititi, the Oscar-winning director from New Zealand, who has been giving fresh updates on his episode in the long-running space saga. “I’m just trying to sort of go back and harness a little bit more of the fun from the original films,”he told Variety, adding of George Lucas’ original trilogy: “The stakes were very high [and] there were serious things going on but also there was a lot fun to be had in those films. That’s what I was trying to bring back.”This sounds like a perfectly reasonable way forward, until we recall that Waititi was first tipped to make one of these films six years ago and that nothing much has happened since. Most of us only remembered that the New Zealander had once signed on to this thing because Kathleen Kennedy, the outgoing Lucasfilm president, described the proposed film as “still somewhat alive” in an“exit” interview earlier this month with Deadline. Other once-mooted projects that still might one day make it to production apparently include Donald Glover’s idea for a Lando Calrissian movie and a possible new trilogy from Simon Kinberg. Kennedy even suggested Adam Driver and Steven Soderbergh’s mysterious Hunt for Ben Solo script,which caused a minor buzz when its existence was revealed by the actor last year, might have a chance to get made “if somebody’s willing to take a risk”.Less was said about the once much-hyped New Jedi Order film that was announced at Star Wars Celebration 2023, with Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy directing and Daisy Ridley’s Rey as the central character. Reports this week suggest that Ridley won’t be returning in next year’s Star Wars: Starfighter, which Ryan Gosling is set to headline.Screenwriter Jonathan Tropper told Screenrantthe film features “no legacy characters”, adding: “You’re not going to see any of the characters you’ve seen in the other movies.”View image in fullscreenMuch anticipated … Pedro Pascal in a scene from The Mandalorian series, which hits the big screen in May.Photograph: APThis could of course be typical Hollywood smoke and mirrors, though few fans are really clamouring for the return ofanyof the characters from the sequel trilogy. So awful and misguided was the last entry, 2019’sThe Rise of Skywalker, that the idea that Star Wars could wheel out Rey, Finn, Poe Dameron (or anyone else from the recent films) to gasps of wonder is laughable.Instead, next up for the saga isThe Mandalorian& Grogu, a big screen segue for a TV series that pretty much everyone likes. And yet even here there are naysayers, pointing out that director Jon Favreau and new Lucasfilm president Dave Filoni could have just given us season four instead. The show has everything Star Wars fans want: nostalgia, lore expansion, charm and knockabout space larks, and yet bringing it to the big screen does feel a little bit like cheating, as if theatrical relevance is now something that has to be reverse-engineered from streaming success.The problem, perhaps, is that Lucasfilm has spent so long palpably having no idea what Star Wars is supposed to be, and where it should be going. Some would inexplicably rather see Driver firing up the crossguard lightsaber again; others want something entirely new, provided it also feels exactly like the old thing they loved.What this leaves Star Wars with, yet again, is not a creative crisis so much as an identity standoff: a franchise paralysed by its own audience, endlessly triangulating between comfort, novelty and outrage, and somehow managing to disappoint people even when it gives them what they asked for.Explore more on these topicsFilmWeek in geekStar WarsThe MandalorianTaika WaititiScience fiction and fantasy filmsTelevisioncommentShareReuse this content"

It wasanother near flawless performancefrom the Belarusian, another match she dominated from start to finish without any response, reinforcing her status as the leading hard court player of her generation.Six matches in, Sabalenka’s fourth consecutive run to theAustralian Openfinal has proved one of her most impressive. She is yet to drop a set and has shown how much her game has evolved by also dominating the net and peppering opponents with an array of drop shots. The few times she has been pushed, such as in her third round match against Anastasia Potapova, the world No 1 has produced her best tennis in the decisive moments and been in control of the baseline throughout.Aryna Sabalenka hits out at umpire after grunting penalty in win over SvitolinaRead moreA completely different match-up awaits Sabalenka on Saturday as she faces Elena Rybakina, the fifth seed and one of her toughest rivals, for her fifth grand slam title. While their career achievements reflect the fact that Sabalenka is more rounded, a better mover and returner with greater variation and consistency, Rybakina is one of the only players capable of tearing the racket from Sabalenka’s hands.This was the case just three months ago at the end-of-season finals in Riyadh, where Rybakina closed outa spectacular 6-3, 7-6 (0) win over Sabalenkato clinch the second biggest title of her career behindher Wimbledon crown. At the end of the match, after the Kazakhstani bulldozed through the second set tie-break without dropping a point, an inconsolable Sabalenka was captured on video venting to her team: “Once a year, even a stick shoots,” she said of Rybakina’s performance.Rybakina is not nearly as erratic as Sabalenka suggested, but her title run in Riyadh had come after many false starts. Until a few weeks before the finals, Rybakina was not even in a qualifying spot as one of the top eight players. Her late surge in Asia to reach the event increasingly looks like one of the more significant moments of her career. She has continued the momentum she built in Riyadh, also reaching this final in Melbourne without dropping a set. While Sabalenka’s level has been astounding, there is no doubt that Rybakina has had the tougher path to the final, defeating two top players in the world No 2,Iga Swiatek, andJessica Pegula, the No 6.The rivalry between Sabalenka and Rybakina is responsible for some of the best matches in recent years, with Sabalenka holding an 8-6 lead, but none of their meetings compare to their final here three years ago. At that point, Sabalenka was still searching for her first grand slam title while Rybakina, one year her junior, had won Wimbledon in 2022. Sabalenka showed exactly what she was capable of,recovering from a set down to win her first major titlein a first-strike battle of the highest quality.View image in fullscreenAryna Sabalenka (left) embraces Elena Rybakina after winning their Australian Open final in 2023.Photograph: David Gray/AFP/Getty ImagesSo much has happened since then. Sabalenka has transformed herself from a contender into the undisputed best player in the world and she continues to sweep up grand slam finals every year. The biggest questions surrounding the 27-year-old’s career is exactly how high she can rise in the history books and how celebrated her career will turn out to be.Sabalenka is now the second woman in the open era, after Martina Hingis, to reach seven consecutive grand slam finals on hard courts. A victory would earn Sabalenka her third Australian Open victory in four years. She would rise to joint 12th on the open era list for most slam titles won by a female player, drawing her level with Hingis and Maria Sharapova.Not as much has changed for Rybakina in terms of her top-line career achievements. As was the case three years ago, she is here in the final weekend of the Australian Open attempting to follow her Wimbledon triumph by winning a second grand slam title. The toughest possible challenge in women’s tennis awaits.Explore more on these topicsAustralian Open 2026Aryna SabalenkaAustralian OpenTennisAustralia sportfeaturesShareReuse this content"

At 38 years old, he is the oldest Australian Open men’s finalist in history.Djokovic shocks Sinner in late-night thriller to reach Australian Open finalRead more“I never stopped believing in myself,” he said. “There’s a lot of people that doubt me. I see there is a lot of experts all of a sudden that wanted to retire me or have retired me many times the last couple of years.“I want to thank them all, because they gave me strength. They gave me motivation to prove them wrong, which I have tonight. For me, it’s not a surprise, to be honest. I know what I’m capable of.”It took an superlative display from the Serb to defeat Sinner, who has become one of the two dominant forces in men’s tennis alongside Carlos Alcaraz. Djokovic played bold, offensive tennis, eviscerating his forehand, serving brilliantly in the important moments and matching the Italian’s physicality despite being 14 years older than his rival.“I wouldn’t dare to call it [my] finest ever [victory] but definitely the finest in the last couple of years,” said Djokovic. “Under the circumstances and semis against Sinner, who has been playing best tennis of his life in the last couple of years, particularly here … the two-time defending champion, [it] doesn’t get better than this.“Honestly, when I started my preparations for the new season and kind of set the goals, it’s no secret that grand slams are where I want to play my best tennis. But it becomes, I guess, more difficult for me to motivate myself, and I ask myself questions. ‘OK, what is it that I’m looking for from myself?’ I was imagining playing against Jannik and Carlos [Alcaraz] at the final stages of grand slams this year and battling it out and really giving it all that I have.“So, very fortunate to already get it in the first slam of the year. So, yeah, big win. Very proud. Very happy. Very relieved, as well, because it was physically very demanding and gruelling.”Djokovic will next face Alcaraz, the No 1, after the Spaniardsurvived his own five-set epicagainst Alexander Zverev, the third seed: “I know I have to come back in less than a couple of days and fight the No 1 in the world,” said Djokovic. “I just hope that I’ll have enough gas to stay toe to toe with him. That’s my desire, then let the gods decide the winner.”Explore more on these topicsAustralian Open 2026Australian OpenNovak DjokovicJannik SinnerTennisAustralia sportnewsShareReuse this content"

I’m not insane. Not a Meaden or a Paphitis. But perhaps one of the minor ones, some strangely groomed South African retail magnate called Dork van Frotwangle who looks as if he keeps a bag of human fingers in his freezer and will mysteriously disappear mid-series and never be mentioned again.One key project I’m working up right now is the Temporary Burner Identity. Burner phone. Disposable online backstory. Pre-pixelated features. Can you imagine the joy of being able to go somewhere or do something and not be watched or identified? This is the future of luxury freedom (write that down, Dork).The Arsenal fan psychodrama: Big Defeat Headloss hits hard after United setback | Chris GodfreyRead moreBeing able to travel to, say, Spain, and nobody knows you’re there. To buy things, have experiences, meet people, and it’s not part of an indelible digital footprint that will echo and rebound and stalk your existence, popping up decades later in those on-screen boxes that want to sell you elite incontinence pants in massive letters while you’re on the train.Or more broadly, just being able to escape. To breathe and get lost in the world, to exist in some anonymous space free from the white noise, the ceaseless robot voices of daily existence. This is human life now ever since The Great Networking of the early 2010s. We are all condemned to live like General Zod in Superman, hurtling through space inside a giant iPad, faces pressed up against the glass in a silent scream.And OK, you won’t be hidden exactly. Just mutable, like you’re striding past the face recognition cameras wearing an endlessly interchangeable Hannibal Lecter-style human face. Like you’ve scissored off a selection of human faces and carry them around in a briefcase and this is actually fine.And OK, OK, yes, it would obviously be used for crime, because every human invention enables crime, its first principle always: what’s the nonce angle here? So perhaps we could build in failsafes. We could monitor you. We could store your movements and data. Just in case. Actually, maybe don’t wear the Temporary Burner Identity at all. That’s probably easier. Buy it. Don’t use it. But we will throw in a mail order powder that gives you a six-pack and makes you magnetically charismatic (disclaimer: powder will not create six-pack or magnetic charisma).This is the real problem. The networked existence. Being seen all the time. It has become inescapable. Nobody planned this properly or thought about what it might do to us. Nobody makes enough allowances for its effects, an advanced version of the Albert Camus idea that everyday life is so absurd that just existing is an act of revolutionary courage, that behind the eyes of every human is a dizzying matrix of pain and confusion. And yes, the algorithm is telling me you’re also thinking about Victor Gyökeres here.View image in fullscreenViktor Gyökeres: a matrix of pain and confusion?Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianThe big question in the current Premier League season is unexpectedly textural. Not so much what tactical shifts are in play, or who is the best goalscorer. But why does it feel like this? Why does an otherwise straightforward set of results feel like an endless doom-scroll of trapped energy and lurking meltdown? The keynote is the basic strangeness ofArsenal, as we enter another staging point in a title race that is simultaneously gripping and tedious, and oddly tender in its contortions.Arsenal will probably win the league from here. They have the points, the squad and the fallible opponents. The only real certainty is that it will be agonisingly intense, the footballing equivalent of a silent scream. Not to mention hugely addictive. I for one am already pining for the game against Leeds on Saturday afternoon, which will be 0-0 at 60 minutes and from there dissolve into repeated clips of Mikel Arteta furiously whirling his arms on the touchline, a Lego-haired avatar of pain, dressed as ever in slickly generic black outdoor clothing, like an elite sniper on a fishing trip.There are some obvious answers as to why it feels like this. The most obvious is that what we are witnessing is a bottling. Simple stuff. A cowardice is taking place. Arsenal have to win the league, or they are basically betas, frauds, cucks, a papier-mache imitation of actual human men.Watching them try to create or play with fluency is like having your eyes slowly gouged with a blunt teaspoonThe thing is, bottling doesn’t really exist. It’s just a word. It’s outcome-based logic, Deeney’s paradox, thecojonesobsession, which confuses being good at football with being morally good and brave and right. Bottling is the absence of analysis.The burden of history has been mentioned, the long wait for a title. But that also feels too vague. These are hugely driven individuals from places such as São Paulo and the Basque Country. Kai Havertz may look like a minor royal cousin with a top-10 world croquet ranking but he has to be hard as nails just to operate in this rarefied air. Gabriel Magalhães is not feeling Perry Groves’s breath on his back.But something is clearly being done to them. Arsenal are top, but their leading scorer has five goals. Watching them try to create or play with fluency is like having your eyes slowly gouged with a blunt teaspoon. This is either a phase about to break, or a new way of playing, or a metric of future failure, expected non-goals in the final third of the season.The most interesting explanation is a parable of robotisation. Arsenal’s flaw lies in an overmechanisation of tactics. What we have here is the first post-human football team. This may be halfway to the truth. Arsenal are undeniably laden with data, from use of the StatDNA platform, to talk of an internal AI information bank, millions of data points used to predict not just injury and fatigue but game simulations, where to stand, where to pass, total set piece, mechanised attack patterns. Arsenal do express certain aspects of the modern world. There’s the feeling in his public pronouncements that Arteta is selling some kind of male wellness brand or restating his success vectors for the stakeholders. He even looks in these moments like an AI simulation of Handsome Earnest Football Man.View image in fullscreenMikel Arteta’s Arsenal express certain aspects of the modern world.Photograph: Andy Rain/EPASo is this it? Are we looking at a fatal flaw? Is this the hubris of robotisation? It sounds a little bogus. Fear of the future is as old as the future itself. People said this about television in the 1950s. They said steam train travel was impossible because humans would suffocate at such speeds. Artificial intelligence does sound frightening. But it’s not intelligent. It’s not even artificial. Its just a scraping of human thought-goo expressed in lines of code.It is part of the most obvious point of difference, however. Which is: scrutiny. The online life. Being seen, surveilled, constantly interfaced. People often wonder why things are happening the way they are. Answer: it’s always the internet. Populism, rage, polarised stupidity wars. Of course the world has gone off its axis. This is the most profound shift in human consciousness ever enacted, the creation of a global hive-mind, the ability to hear the thoughts, shouts and brain-blurts of every single citizen of Namibia from your bedroom in Brentwood.We are all terminally online now and this Arsenal team is the most extreme expression yet of this experience in sporting form. It comes in part from that internal scrutiny. Arteta is a massive data guy. Everyone at every level is tracked, statted, diced, sliced. How is this going to make you feel, or act, or perform complex movements? Mainly it is external. All fandom is online now, Arsenal’s particularly so, and in a way that feels unusually present. People have been talking about Arsenal bottling the league since September because content must always happen. There is an excess of feeling, micro-reasoning, total analysis, a complete absence of quiet space or places to breathe.This isn’t new but it is more intense from year to year. It is also the most overlooked factor in elite modern sport, the way being observed constantly will of course alter the experience. You can see this creeping into problems on the pitch. Arsenal need to create more, to be more spontaneous, to dance like no one’s watching. Go on. Do it while everyone is watching, while that white noise seeps into every pocket of your existence.How to fix this? Arteta conducted a tension-busting “face-meeting” with his players this week but even this has already become public product, put through the content wringer, mined for meaning. It brings us back to the burner identity. To succeed in the middle of all that heat and light has always been a matter of finding a still space, a bubble of silence. Never more so than now.If Arsenal do fall away this season it will in part be down to this new and entirely pervasive sense of static, a first terminally-online collapse from perhaps the most terminally-online team yet devised.Explore more on these topicsArsenalcommentShareReuse this content"

It followed reporting from the Telegraph that theCricketRegulator is investigating the 26-year-old, Jacob Bethell and Josh Tongue over their conduct that evening. It was also reported that all three were fined by the England and Wales Cricket Board.Breakdown in cricket relations with Bangladesh rings alarm bells for India’s Olympic bidRead moreIn the statement, sent to the media after England’s victory against Sri Lanka inthe opening Twenty20 internationalin Pallekele, Brook said: “I accept responsibility for my actions in Wellington and acknowledge that others were present that evening.“I regret my previous comments and my intention was to protect my teammates from being drawn into a situation that arose as a result of my own decisions. I have apologised and will continue to reflect on the matter. This has been a challenging period in my career, but one from which I am learning.“I recognise that I have more to learn regarding the off-field responsibilities that come with leadership and captaincy. I remain committed to developing in this area and to improving both personally and professionally.”Brook was involved in the altercationduring his first away series as England’s limited-overs captain and reported the incident midway through the ODI defeat the next day in Wellington. News of the incident did not break until after the Ashes, with the ECB stating that it dealt with the matter “through a formal and confidential disciplinary process”.The batter accepted last week that he was fortunate still to be England captain. Brook said: “Even if I had been sacked, I’d have held my hands up and said: ‘Look, I’ve made the mistake,’ and I’d have been perfectly fine with getting sacked from the job as captain, as long as I was still playing cricket.“I think I’ve got a little bit of work to do to try to regain the trust of the players. I said sorry to them yesterday. I felt like I needed to say sorry for my actions. It’s not acceptable as a player, but as a captain it’s really not acceptable to do what I did in New Zealand.

Vonn’s airbag deployed on impact and she remained down for several moments while medical staff attended to her on the piste.Vonn, Shiffrin and Kim headline US ski and snowboard team for 2026 OlympicsRead moreVonn eventually stood and was able to ski away, but did so gingerly. She repeatedly took weight off her left leg, using her poles to steady herself, and stopped several times on the run down to check her knee. At the finish area she was met by her teammate Jacqueline Wiles, with the two sharing a long embrace before Vonn limped into a medical tent for further evaluation. She was later airlifted from the finish area by helicopter, suspended by a rope as she was transported away across the Swiss Alps.Vonn’s coach this season, the two-time Olympic champion Aksel Lund Svindal, told Reuters, “She has some pain so it’s better to have some checks, the physio did some checks, they seemed OK but there were things he was not 100% sure so it was good to have it checked.”Race officials cancelled the downhill shortly after Vonn’s crash, with three of the first six skiers having fallen in difficult conditions on a course that had already been shortened because of the weather. Austria’s Nina Ortlieb crashed in the same upper section as Vonn but was able to ski away, while Norway’s Marte Monsen hit the nets near the bottom of the course and was taken away on a stretcher with facial injuries.Romane Miradoli of France, one of the few skiers to complete her run, said visibility was a major issue. “You can’t see, and it’s bumpy everywhere,” she said. Asked whether conditions were dangerous, Miradoli added: “We just couldn’t see well.”Vonn had been the sixth starter and the first of the seeded racers to leave the gate. She was leading at the first checkpoint before landing a jump off balance, lifting her left arm and pole high in an attempt to regain control. As she tried to brake, she was spun around and slid into the safety fencing.Allow Instagram content?This article includes content provided byInstagram.

She is also entered in the super-G and the new team combined event. The women’s alpine events will be held in Cortina d’Ampezzo, a venue where Vonn has enjoyed some of the greatest success of her career, with a record 12 World Cup victories.Any injury at this stage would be a major concern for the United States team and for Olympic organizers, who have billed Vonn as one of the standout stars of the Games. A US Ski and Snowboard spokesperson said Vonn was being evaluated following the fall.Despite the uncertainty, Vonn sought to play down fears that her Olympic bid was over, insisting she still hoped to compete in Cortina.“I crashed today in the downhill race in Switzerland and injured my left knee,” Vonnwrote on social media. “My Olympic dream is not over.”She added that she was continuing to undergo medical evaluations, saying she was “discussing the situation with my doctors and team” and would continue to undergo further examinations.Vonnhas been in outstanding form this season, leading the World Cup downhill standings with five podium finishes from five races, including two victories. Her performances have underpinned an unlikely return to the top of the sport following a partial knee replacement on her right leg less than two years ago. Shecame out of retirement last seasonafter nearly six years away from competition and has described her physical condition as the best it has been in years.View image in fullscreenLindsey Vonn of the US is airlifted to the hospital after sustaining an injury in a crash during her run on Friday in Crans-Montana, Switzerland.Photograph: Denis Balibouse/ReutersThe fall also revived memories of a career marked by serious injuries. Vonn tore the ligaments in her right knee in a high-speed crash at the 2013 world championships and was airlifted from the course. She suffered further damage the following season and missed the 2014 Sochi Olympics as a result. Over the course of her career she has also broken arms and legs and sustained a concussion.Despite those setbacks, Vonn remains one of the most decorated skiers in history. Shewon Olympic downhill goldat the 2010 Vancouver Games, eight years after making her Olympic debut as a teenager in Salt Lake City. Like her US teammate Mikaela Shiffrin, she is among the most successful female World Cup racers of all time.Three training runs for the Olympic downhill are scheduled in Cortina d’Ampezzo from 5–7 February, with the medal race set for the following day.“This is a very difficult outcome one week before the Olympics,” Vonn wrote. “But if there’s one thing I know how to do, it’s a comeback. It’s not over until it’s over.”Friday’s race in Crans-Montana was due to be the final competitive downhill before Olympic training begins next week, with the first official downhill training run scheduled for Wednesday. The World Cup stop was staged under a subdued atmosphere after aNew Year’s Eve bar firein the resort that killed 40 people and injured more than 100.Explore more on these topicsLindsey VonnSkiingUSA Olympic teamWinter Olympics 2026Mikaela ShiffrinUS sportsWinter OlympicsShareReuse this content"

Those victories have lifted United to fourth, on 38 points, four points ahead of Fulham, and Carrick warned there would be no change of approach when Marco Silva’s side arrive at Old Trafford.“Tough game, tough challenge,” said United’s interim manager. “Marco has got Fulham into a really good team. Just because we are at home, taking anything for granted is bang out of order so it might be a case it’s the same flow of the game as the last two weeks. No shame in that, we will deal with the game in front of us and do whatever it takes to come out on top.”Joshua Zirkzee, who has returned to training after injury, has been linked with a transfer before Monday’s deadline. “I think Josh has just been trying to work to get fit and get back around the group and it’s been great to have him back training yesterday,” said Carrick. “That’s literally as far as it goes for me and for Josh. I’m looking forward to working with him. Nothing else needs to be said.”Carrick did confirm Patrick Dorgu will be unavailable for a prolonged period due to the muscle problem he sustained at Arsenal. “He’s disappointed, he’s had such a big couple of weeks,” said Carrick. “We weren’t sure whether it was a little bit of cramp or something more serious and at the moment it looks a little bit more on the serious, so it’ll be a few weeks for that. How many, we’ll have to wait and see.”Jamie Jackson2.No bad blood over Isak wrangle, says HoweEddie Howe is not expecting to welcome any new faces to his Newcastle squad before the transfer window closes on Monday night but travels to Liverpool on Saturday buoyed up by afine away performanceat the Champions League holders Paris Saint-Germain.That 1-1 draw on Wednesday night secured Newcastle a two-legged European playoff against Qarabag. It entails a long trek to Baku but Howe believes his team’s recent struggles on the road should be consigned to the past. “It was a high-level, elite, game in Paris,” he said. “My players showed their quality; we’ve proved how good we are away from home. We should have no fears now.”More immediately, Newcastle are seeking a first Premier League win at Liverpool since 1994, with Howe maintaining the bad blood provoked by Alexander Isak’s protracted £125m transfer to the Merseyside club last summer is forgotten. “We’ve moved on,” he said. “What happened is irrelevant now. We’re not looking back, we’re looking forward. There’s certainly nothing (animosity behind the scenes) on our side.”While Isak is sidelined by a broken leg, Newcastle’s captain, Bruno Guimarães, faces a fitness test on his ankle injury. Although Joelinton will be absent, Guimarães’s midfield sidekick appears weeks rather than months away from a return.“Joe flew to Barcelona for an injection into his groin,” said Newcastle’s manager. “And the specialist feels his return could be quite quick, we’re looking at weeks not months.”The full-back Tino Livramentois pencilled in to recover from hamstring trouble in time for a return in early March.Louise Taylor3.Fair to judge me on this season, says SlotArne Slot has said it is fair to judge him on a troubled second season at Liverpool and not his title-winning debut, with online abuse “part of the job” of being a manager in 2026.Slot has received fierce criticism on social media, a lot of it personal, and it reignited when his team’s 13-game unbeaten run ended at Bournemouth last Saturday. Even comfortable passage into the last 16 of the Champions League for a second successive season on Wednesday, courtesy of a 6-0 rout of Qarabag, did not spare Slot criticism, specifically in regards to one post-match comment.A reminder that Liverpool exited the Europa League quarter-finals against Atalanta two years ago, before sailing through the Champions League group two years running, landed Slot in trouble with the keyboard warriors.Rather than feeling entitled to more respect for winning Liverpool’s 20th league championship last year, the Dutchman accepts that he should be judged on the merits of the current campaign. Liverpool are sixth, 14 points behind leaders Arsenal, before facing Newcastle at Anfield on Saturday.“Maybe that has changed for managers, that even if you have won something there is still room for criticism, which to a certain extent is normal because we are in a new season and I was the first to say to the players: ‘We have to forget last season’,” said Slot. “So it is fair that people judge me on this season and not on last season.”“It is the part of the job, part of the thing we are living in,” Slot added. “What I meant [about the Europa League comment] was that season Liverpool ended up third in the league and we are currently sixth, so I didn’t want to make the point that was a poor season.“I only said we have achieved so much at this club but sometimes we also have to enjoy a moment like this. We cannot take those things for granted. For all the other things that are being said, that is what you have to accept if you are a manager that is not winning enough games.”Slot’s options are stretched for the visit of Newcastle on Saturday, though Ibrahima Konaté should return from compassionate leave and Curtis Jones is available after illness. But the head coach insists he is happy with the size of Liverpool’s squad and the club’s business model. “Everyone talks about £450m [being spent] but we had to recoup £300m [since 2024],” he said. “That’s our model and I am not frustrated about that. Maybe I am little bit frustrated that too many people don’t notice what our model is. That’s the model I stepped in to and I even embrace it. It’s a good model to have for any club.“We were able to achieve a lot of good things since this ownership is here with this model of sustainability. So we sold for £300m and bought £450m. But £250m we haven’t used yet – Alexander Isak, Jeremie Frimpong only a little bit and Giovanni Leoni not at all. That is the reality.”Andy Hunter4.Fulham sign Bobb for £27mFulham have completed the signing of wingerOscar Bobbfrom Manchester City on a five-year deal. The 22-year-old Norway international has moved to Craven Cottage in what is understood to be a £27m deal.Meanwhile, Pep Guardiola missed media duties before his side’s trip to Tottenham for personal reasons on Friday. The Manchester City manager was due to hold a lunchtime press conference to preview Sunday’s Premier League game but the club later confirmed the assistant Pep Lijnders would take his place.It comes after Guardiola gave a speech in support of Palestinian children at a charity concert in his home city of Barcelona on Thursday. The club said Guardiola was not present due to a personal reason. The Spaniard was expected to be back for training on Saturday.PA MediaView image in fullscreenOscar Bobb has joined Fulham from Manchester City in a £27m deal.Photograph: News Images LTD/Alamy5.Frank convinced Spurs owners ‘super committed’Thomas Frank talked up the “big commitment” of Tottenham’s owners despite a quiet January and insisted transfers were not as easy as Football Manager after they missed out on Antoine Semenyo. Spurs will face Semenyo on Sunday when Manchester City visit and Frank revealed the former Bournemouth attacker had been a big target for this winter transfer window before he decided to join Guardiola’s title-chasing side.With only days of the window left, Tottenham have signed Conor Gallagher from Atlético Madrid and the teenage Brazilian left-back Souza, but sold last season’s leading scorer Brennan Johnson and lost Mohammed Kudus, Richarlison, Rodrigo Bentancur, Ben Davies and Lucas Bergvall to serious injuries in January.It led Frank to acknowledge his current squad of players to choose from was weaker than at the start of this month, but he rejected any notion that the majority owners ENIC – run by the Lewis family Trust – were not committed to this project with Spurs down in 14th in the Premier League table.Before a daunting run of fixtures in February, which begins with the visit of City, Frank said: “I think we lost, I can’t remember, six or seven players inside three weeks in January? That’s crazy. There were definitely too many, so yeah of course [the squad] it’s weaker than we started the first of January.“I can promise that the Lewis family is super committed to this project. They want to do everything and I would go against my rule, hopefully only once, that there’s no doubt it’s clear that the club wants to sign Semenyo. They did everything. I think that’s a clear signal.Frank revealed a late call would be made on Micky van de Ven after he missed the impressive midweekvictory at Eintracht Frankfurtwith a “minor” injury, but Spurs could still be without eight players despite Pedro Porro and Richarlison being primed for a return at the end of February.PA Media6.Nuno believes Traoré can boost survival driveNuno Espírito Santo believes he can get the best out of Adama Traoré and that the “unique” winger can boost West Ham’s efforts to beat the drop after the manager was reunited with Traoré, having coached him at Wolves, rescuing the 30-year-old from a disappointing season at Fulham.“I’ve worked with him for many years, and I know him well,” said Nuno. “He’s unique – there aren’t many players with his ability one-on-one, or with his pace. He’s going to give us many things that we need. He possesses great threat, and he has great energy, not only on the pitch, but in the dressing room and at the training ground too. He’s a special person to have around. It’s not up to me to judge what’s happened to him before. I’m just happy to have him here.”The Hammers briefly closed the gap to 17th-placed Nottingham Forest to two points last weekend after beating Sunderland, but Forest responded a day later by winning at Brentford to leave Nuno’s side five adrift of safety going into Saturday’s trip to Chelsea. “We just have to focus on ourselves, and ignore what our opponents are doing,” Nuno added. “We have to try to compete well, play well, achieve results and keep going. We can’t focus on what the other teams are doing, because we can’t control that.”PA Media7.Rosenior reinforcements ‘must be right’Liam Rosenior said Chelsea are ready to move in the final days of the transfer window if the right players are available. The Blues are in the market for a central defender and have been optimistic that a deal for a long-term target could be reached before the end of January.A long-term injury to Levi Colwill which is likely to see him miss the whole season has left Chelsea short of options in the position, but it is understood no emergency cover is likely to be sanctioned with the club preferring to stick with their recruitment plans from before the England defender’s injury.The deadline for deals is on Monday night and Rosenior confirmed that the sporting directors Paul Winstanley and Lawrence Stewart are actively working on strengthening the team and are ready to back their head coach. “The guys are working hard to stay on top of things in terms of information on what’s out there, who’s interested in our players,” said Rosenior. “It’s about being prepared for any development.“My job along with the guys is to make the squad in every area as strong as it can possibly be. Certain players come up that you don’t expect to come up, and then can strengthen you. Whether that’s a striker or a wide player or a defender. If we see something, I know the guys are willing to do it. I don’t want to bring in players for the sake of bringing in players. There’s a possibility it could be busy, a possibility it could be quiet.”PA MediaExplore more on these topicsPremier LeagueThe talknewsShareReuse this content"

The EFL is assessing whether the bidders comply with the requirements of its owners’ and directors’ test (ODT).At the end of the season those assessments are being taken over by the Independent Football Regulator and it would pick up the Wednesday case if it has not been completed. The regulator also has the authority to assess incumbent owners, and has powers of investigation, sanction and enforcement more draconian than those of the EFL.The Bord/Roemer consortium has paid a multimillion-pound deposit to secure exclusive negotiating rights to buy Wednesday, and has provided evidence to the administrators, Begbies Traynor, that it has the funding to complete the proposed £30m-plus purchase and three years of operating costs.The sources of that funding are being analysed by the EFL, and the buyers’ involvement in gambling could complicate the takeover, with sources indicating due diligence is in its early stages. An EFL spokesperson said the ODT process was ongoing.Other clubs owned by gambling companies, notably Tony Bloom’s Brighton and Matthew Benham’s Brentford, have dispensation from the Football Association, which banned football betting for all participants in 2014. As part of that agreement Bloom and Benham allow the accounts of their betting consultancies, Starlizard and Smartodds respectively, to be independently audited on behalf of the FA to ensure they are not betting on football.Bord and Roemer would have to sign a similar undertaking, although it is unclear whether the FA would grant them dispensation. Bloom and Benham were club owners when the rules were introduced. The FA is understood to be liaising with the EFL.There is no public record of Bord’s wealth beyond reported career poker winnings of about £3m. The 44-year-old has worked for the data-driven betting businesses of Bloom and Benham, and multiple sources in the industry have described him as a successful gambler.View image in fullscreenJames Bord at a Dunfermline game. He co-owns the Scottish club.Photograph: Mark Scates/Mark Scates/SNSBord’s and Roemer’s advisers said that the Wednesday bid was being privately funded, with the pair having made money through investments in technology and analytics, but declined to go into more details.Roemer’s funding appears more clearcut through his ownership of crypto-gambling casino and sports betting site, Gamdom, an offshore operation registered in the Indian Ocean Comoros Islands.Bord also owns the Scottish Championship club Dunfermline with a fellow poker player, Evan Sofa, and has stakes in the Spanish club Córdoba and the Bulgarian side Septemvri Sofia with other investors.Bord’s other publicly known vehicle, Short Circuit Science, a data and analytics company, appears to be based offshore beacuse it is not registered in the UK or US. There are no public details of its staffing levels or business operations. Short Circuit had a contract with Sheffield United to advise on player recruitment last year until it emerged that Bord was bidding for Wednesday.Bord and Roemer beat off competition from six other bidders, including the former Newcastle owner Mike Ashley, to agree a deal to buy Wednesday after the club entered administration last October.Begbies Traynor is understood to retain confidence in its preferred bidder, but is aware of the ODT process make take considerable time, which led them to sell several players this month to ensure the club have sufficient cashflow to finish the season. The club captain Barry Bannan left for Millwall and Chelsea agreed to pay £500,000 for the 17-year-old defender Yisa Alao.Clive Betts, Labour MP for Sheffield South East, urged the EFL to run a rigorous process despite his desire for a sale to be completed.“The source of funding has to be a concern, given the inherent volatility of those industries,” Betts said. “Even if the EFL approves the takeover, what level of sustainability is there? These are issues that need to be addressed. I’m sure the regulator will be taking a close look, as even if they aren’t running the ODT they could inherit these owners. This is a massive test for the regulator. Given the nature of the bidders they will want to ensure there’s a thorough process, and it could take a long time.”Explore more on these topicsSheffield WednesdayFootball LeaguenewsShareReuse this content"

The Frenchman was on a Zanzibar beach, surrounded by a group of 10-year-old boys he had schooled in a kickabout that helped him rediscover his love of the game after a difficult start in Basel.Switzerland was next on Barry’s path after he had proven his talent in the Belgian second division at Beveren but it was not a smooth trajectory. “Two stupid red cards” in his first two appearances and failing to score in 16 Swiss league games left Barry needing to get away, so he headed to Africa and switched off his phone to enjoy the tranquillity of the Indian Ocean, a world away from football.David Moyes resigned to being without Jack Grealish for rest of Everton’s seasonRead more“I had played in Belgium and scored 20 goals, easy 20 goals, and then I went to Basel and when I went there I thought it would be easy to score there, too,” Barry says from Everton’s Finch Farm training ground before Saturday’s game at Brighton. “I found it was not easy. With the pressure and everything, I lost my confidence, I lost the love to play football – I lost everything. I saw some kids playing on the beach. My girlfriend said: ‘Go and play with these kids.’ I went and played and had a game. I was dribbling and just loved to touch the ball and when I came back to Basel I was like a different person.”Nine goals in the second half of the season caught the eye of Villarreal, where his 11 goals earned a£27m move to Merseyside. Talk of his time in Switzerland brings perspective for Barry, who endured another tough beginning in England, going 16 games without finding the net and failing even to register a shot on target until December. But David Moyes’s faith never wavered and the rewards are being reaped.Barry has four goalsin his past five Premier League games, helping Everton to 10th, four points off fifth.Years of rejection as a teenager fuelled Barry to fulfil his potential. He was not in an academy, joining Sochaux at 18 as a winger after failed trials with Clermont and Hamilton Academical, the former as a defender and the latter in central midfield, and has settled on being a striker only in the past two years. “When I was younger I never played as a striker, I always played centre-back, right-back, left-back, all the positions but not striker,” Barry says. “I don’t know why. When I went to Sochaux I started to play more attacking.“Because I wasn’t in an academy I arrived very late in football. I always do the next step because I dream big. Always my dad says: ‘Sometimes I think you are crazy, because always you talk and afterwards you have what you want.’ Like in a recent game, Jimmy [Garner] got man of the match and I said: ‘One day I hope you give me that’ and the next week he was presenting me with it. When I talk and when I want something I do everything I can to get it.”Barry, whose English is improving by watching Power on Netflix, remains his own harshest critic but, whether amid feast or famine in front of goal, his work ethic never relents. Everton fans appreciated his endeavour during the barren times, showing their adulation when he was substituted in the 13th game of his drought against Fulham, as they desperately sought a long-term solution to the problematic central striking role. “Sometimes it is not about a goal, but the sentiment,” says Barry. “My parents were watching the game and they heard the standing ovation. After the game my mum called me and said: ‘You see, the people love you. You need to give the love back.’ Good things come to those who wait.”View image in fullscreenThierno Barry’s second-half equaliser earned Everton a point against Leeds last Monday.Photograph: Jason Cairnduff/Action Images/ReutersIt is hard to imagine a dejected Barry, who has an electric smile and jovial demeanour. Everton are Barry’s fifth club in as many seasons, each in a different country, but the previous moves were stepping stones. Putting down roots with his girlfriend and nine-month-old daughter is the plan. “All the [previous] clubs, before we talk I said: ‘My dream is to play in the Premier League,’ so if I come here, it’s because I want to go to the Premier League, I want to prove here that I can play there. I think I want to do many years here, because it’s the best competition in the world.”Cutting corners is not part of Barry’s thinking. He employs a personal trainer, nutritionist, two physios and a chef. He can often be found in his garden playing out in-game scenarios, desperate to ensure every detail is covered. On his left wrist is inscribed Me v Me. “I got it in Basel,” Barry says. “When I did the first six months it was like my fault if I didn’t score, if I didn’t play good. The second part of the tattoo was when I played good I saw it as me against me. One day if I forget about things, I can remember by looking at this.”Barry knows there are few guarantees in football, and his fine run cannot go on for ever, but when the bad times almost inevitably return he has better coping mechanisms than most. Will he be seeking a kickabout on Formby beach the next time he loses love for the game? “I play with my little baby, so it’s OK,” he says with a beaming smile, having found the route to goal and happiness.Explore more on these topicsEvertonfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Paddy Graffin, Leopardstown’s clerk of the course, will inspect at 8am.Cheltenham’s hole in the track an unfortunate postscript after Sir Gino setbackRead more“We’ve had a look at a fresh line of the hurdle track right out beside the chase track,” Graffin said on Friday. “In my opinion, this line is currently fit to race despite 22mm of rain last night.“However, we do have the potential for a further 10-20mm of rain. We would like to get a bit of luck with that, but it is currently fit to race.”There are similar concerns at Sandown, which is due to stage a seven-race card including the Grade One Scilly Isles Novice Chase.“There will be a precautionary inspection tomorrow morning at 7.30am,” Andrew Cooper, Sandown’s clerk of the course,said on X. “Both the hurdle and chase courses are currently raceable. There was 2mm of rain on Thursday night into Friday and we are due further rain from 4pm on Friday afternoon into Saturday morning.”Galopin can land record fourth Irish Gold CupGalopin Des Champs was finally beaten in a Leopardstown chase at the eighth time of asking whenonly third behind Affordale Furyin the Savills Chase in December, but Willie Mullins’s gelding was making his seasonal debut and will be strongly fancied to register a record-equalling fourth win in the Irish Gold Cup on Saturday.Galopin Des Champs(3.30)was also beaten first time up in 2023 and 2024 before taking a three-mile Grade One at Leopardstown on his next outing, and showed more than enough to suggest that his talent remains largely intact.The dual Cheltenham Gold Cup winner should also appreciate Saturday’s sterner test on much softer ground, and can beat a top-class field to match Florida Pearl’s record of four wins in the race.Sandown 12.55:Bollin Thouremains lightly raced for an eight-year-old and even a 13lb rise may not be enough to prevent him completing a four-timer.Musselburgh 1.10:A closely matched field of juvenile hurdlers butMade U Blushwon with something to spare last time and gets a 7lb sex allowance from most of her rivals.Sandown 1.25:Gary & Josh Moore’sRip Wheelerwas badly hampered by an early faller last time and will outrun odds of around 6-1 if he returns to his highly promising form earlier in the season.Musselburgh 1.43:Afadil bids to repeat his win in this race two years ago but is without a victory since and the hat-trick-seekingWilliethebuilderhas more substance to his recent form.Musselburgh 2.20:Insurrectionput up his two best performances over fences over track and trip and Freddie Keighley’s 7lb claim is a further point in his favour.Sandown 2.02:The booking of Harry Cobden aboardEscapeandevadefor only his seventh ride for Harry Derham is eye-catching, and the 10-year-old also has winning form on heavy ground.Sandown 2.40:Gordon Elliott’sKala Contiis much improved since switching from hurdles to chasing and saw off a Willie Mullins-trained odds-on shot with ease in a mares’ race at Cork in December.

It turns out chumminess with the president might just come at a costFri 30 Jan 2026 09.36 ESTLast modified on Fri 30 Jan 2026 13.55 ESTShareWhowasn’ton the red carpet at the officialMelania documentarypremiere in Washington DC was so much more intriguing than who was. No offence to defence secretary Pete Hegseth, but if I wanted to see formalwear struggling to containCrusades tattoos, I’d hang around outside theSpartak MoscowChristmas party. Not that it was a red carpet, because the carpet at the “Trump-Kennedy” Center was black. No one bothers hiding the grift any more, with the movie’s own producer openly explaining that this aesthetic was “all about supporting this luxury brand that [Melania’s] creating”. They should have dressed the event like a colon, since Donald’s is effectively where it was being held.Anyway: arrivals. There was Melania and Donald Trump – she finally got him out of hair and makeup – who were holding hands, a coincidentally convenient way to cover his skin if his glam squad didn’t truck in enough concealer. In recent months, Trump has had terrible bruises on the tops of his hands and even moreterrible excusesfor why they keep appearing.Aspirin, Swiss furniture, shaking lots of hands – the list of things that aren’t cannula sites grows longer every week.But how heartbreaking to look at the parade of henchmen and their out-of-towner wives and realise that there was absolutely no sign of Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sánchez Bezos. What happened? Not only did Jeff’s Amazon pay hysterically over the odds to license and market the film, but he and Lauren have never met a red carpet they didn’t love. Certainly since shemanscaped himandcouples-dressed himand told him that that boring vanilla thing he did drove her wild. For the couture shows earlier this week, Lauren and Jeffrolled into Parislike Panzers – and were received with as little resistance – but were nowhere to be found at the premiere on Thursday night.Could it be that the techlords are starting to realise what they got into with Trump? Take another of their number, Apple’s Tim Cook. As mentioned previously,MLK superfanTim spent the night of the latest Minneapolis execution at Saturday’s White House screening of Melania. If he thought he got away with it, that impression was swiftly dispelled by reaction to the online photo of him posing with Melania director Brett Ratner. Oof. This is why leading industrialists should always insist on a no-Instagram rule in the chancellery.But they haven’t, and this stuff does keep leaking out, unhelpfully for them. Erstwhile action director Ratner has nothing to lose, of course, which is why this is the first documentary he’s ever made, unless he once put a hidden camera in a women’s bathroom or something. OK, fine. Legally, I am required to state that Brett Ratner has never been accused of such a thing. That said, the sheer number of baroque allegations against him at #MeToo’s height was hard to keep track of. The actorOlivia Munnsaid she was sent to his trailer to find him furiously masturbating with one hand and holding a prawn cocktail with the other. (Ratner denies etc.) Olivia is currently starring in Apple’s hitYour Friends & Neighbours, so no doubt she was thrilled to see that her big boss Cook turned out to the White House last Saturday. Certainly, enough Apple employees of one level or another lost their shit sufficiently for Tim torelease a statementcalling for a “de-escalation” in times he’s expected to clink glasses with sex cases for presidential favours. Sorry – a de-escalation in tensions in Minneapolis.Someone who knew once told me about how being one of Putin’s oligarchs worked. Every now and then you got a call from the Kremlin saying you needed to fork out and take this or that company or problem off the state’s hands. You put the phone down, swore a bit, and did what you’d been asked. It was sort of a turn system, and it would be one of the other guys’ turns next time round. Last summer it was Tim Cook’s turn, with Apple being railroaded intomassively boostingits domestic supply chain spend. This time round, it must have been Jeff’s turn – but the Amazon founder seems to have judged that spending the price of an empty mining concession in the Urals on a Melania doc was enough.As for how the film will do … hate to break hearts, but my bet is that Melania has a really good opening weekend for a documentary. As well it might, with those financial tailwinds. But the idea that no one in the US – obviously its key market – is going to see it is wishful thinking. How many tickets it sold at the Vue in Bolton just isn’t the deal many would like it to be.Furthermore, there’s always another way to spin the numbers. House speaker Mike Johnson said of Amazon last night: “I think they will make money on this film. But it also has an inestimable value for its cultural impact … I think it transcends dollar figures.” Yup, this thing is Maga’s One Battle After Another –miles off breaking evenat the box office but it gets over some hazy line on prestige metrics. Or asThe Rock bristledover another crappy Amazon film he was in: “Red One has a long shelf life with multiple verticals, kudos to our Amazon partners for their strategic win, that’s just getting started.”But the worry for the techlords must be that the increasingly erratic Trump is only just getting started with them. Whose turn will it be next? You’ve heard plenty about tipping points this week – but the big one will be when the cost of doing business starts to really cost these guys business.Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsMelania TrumpOpinionAmazonJeff BezosTim CookDonald TrumpcommentShareReuse this content"

Those days are overFri 30 Jan 2026 01.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 30 Jan 2026 09.42 ESTShareWho was the last politician you listened to for any length of time? Perhaps it was Andy Burnham or Zack Polanski. Or maybe it was Wes Streeting, Nigel Farage orZarah Sultana. Perhaps your dark secret is that it was Donald Trump.One thing these politicians have in common is that they are all unusually good communicators. From Farage’s drawling provocations to Polanski’s pithy directness, Sultana’s concentrated blasts of outrage to Trump’s mesmerising ramblings, they compel you to listen. The completely forgettable passages that voters across western democracies have associated with political speech for decades are largely absent.In some ways, the return of rhetoric as a hugely advantageous political skill feels like a liberation. Nowadays, it’s true, this skill is often deployed in simpler, cruder ways than in the past: in quick, conversational interventions or digressive public statements and question-and-answer sessions, rather than expertly structured formal speeches. Even if Farage becomes the most iconoclastic prime minister since Margaret Thatcher, it is doubtful that his key utterances will be as anthologised and remembered as hers.Yet for anybody who believes that much of politics is unavoidably about conflict, clashing interests and worldviews, and the arousing and articulation of public emotions, the rise of the compelling communicators is hard to resist. Their often dramatic and populist messages are replacing a worn-out discourse.In Britain and other rich democracies for much of the 1990s, 2000s and 2010s, mainstream political speech became ever more inward-looking and impenetrable: stiff with jargon such as “stakeholders”, “social cohesion” and “the third way”. This language essentially said to voters that politics and government were about complex technical questions that could and should be left to insiders. Politicians still regularly addressed the public, but rarely in an accessible enough way to suggest that they wanted voters to truly understand what they had to say.As long as western economies provided the majority with relatively prosperous and improving lives, many voters were not that bothered about being excluded from the political conversation. But the 2008 financial crisis and subsequent wage stagnation and the cost of living crisis ended that semi-contented apathy. The public appetite for frank politicians, which had never completely gone away – as was shown in Britain by the enduring popularity of vivid communicators such as Tony Benn – started to grow again, until it became a hunger so powerful that politics changed to sate it.Wider social, cultural and technological shifts have added to the value of clear political communication. The decline of deference and formal manners, and the creation of uninhibited digital spaces and networks, have given us a world of outrageous YouTubers and indiscreet voice notes, unbuttoned podcasts and confessional pop songs with the vocals mixed so high that you can hear the singer breathing. Against the backdrop of all this intimate – or intimate-seeming – public communication, a typically formalKeir Starmerspeech or statement, while appropriate for delicate foreign policy work such as his trip to China, in a domestic context sounds almost as out of date and incomprehensible to many voters as a politician from the 1950s.Many of his problems as party leader and prime minister are really about communication, and the belief that Burnham or Streeting orAngela Raynerwould do it much better. As well as being more natural-sounding public speakers – more colloquial and at ease with cultural references – all three sometimes make being a politician actually look enjoyable: Rayner smiling as she bashes the Tories, Streeting plotting with relish, or Burnham enthusing about the transformation of Greater Manchester’s public transport. By contrast, Starmer’s talk of doing his “duty” in a “government of service” weighs voters down, sounding too much like the grind of their own lives. Political communication is often about personifying the right mood.View image in fullscreenFormer prime minister Boris Johnson at the launch of the Indomitable Ukraine exhibition in London, 23 September 2025.Photograph: James Manning/PAAnd yet, appearing to embody some form of welcome change and presenting ideas and policies in appealing ways are hardly the whole of politics. There are also tasks that need to be carried out less publicly: drawing up policies and strategies, undermining rivals and other parties, and making sure that your government’s plans are actually carried out. One danger of the sometimes exhilarating overthrow of technocratic politics is that democracies end up with a politics that is mostly just talk, while less performative but vital aspects of government and opposition are neglected.Boris Johnson’s terrible premiership has already given Britain a taste of government by little but rhetoric. But the speed with which voters have tired of Starmer’s more conscientious administration suggests that many would prefer not to think about how much repair work Britain actually needs. Technocrats such as Starmer wrongly assume that governments don’t need to explain and justify themselves in direct, resonant ways. Yet they are right that not everything a government does can be articulated in colourful, straightforward terms, as populists often claim.From the Burnham row to the China visit, avoiding hard choices is the Starmer doctrine | Rafael BehrRead moreCould our more conventional, cautious politicians adapt to the new communications age? Some are trying. This week, Starmer announced the government’s new policy capping ground rents for leaseholders – a typically worthwhile but hard to dramatise reform – on TikTok. Walking stiffly towards the camera, making too many clenched- rather than open-hand gestures, he concluded with a repetitive sentence that suggested he didn’t quite trust himself to be clear, or clearly understood: “This is a promise that we said we’d deliver, and I’m really pleased that we’re delivering on that promise.” After years of self-control and careful language, it’s probably too late for him and his most guarded ministers to loosen up in public now.As with generations of western centrists, Starmer’s communications style has been shaped by the assumption that powerful conservative interests – big business, financial markets, rightwing journalists and voters – must be offended as little as possible. That approach served leaders such as Tony Blair well, at least in electoral terms. But that was a long time ago. Nowadays, however much Starmer plays down his more leftwing policies and emphasises his patriotic, pro-business or authoritarian credentials, conservatives hate him anyway. Such is our more polarised world. Meanwhile, populists of both left and right say supposedly taboo things to voters – and soar in the polls.It’s time for the government to speak differently. That won’t necessarily save it, so numerous are its enemies and problems. But at leastLabourwill be back in the conversation.Andy Beckett is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsPoliticsOpinionKeir StarmerNigel FarageAndy BurnhamZack PolanskiAngela RaynerWes StreetingcommentShareReuse this content"

Broadway numbers like Springtime for Hitler in The Producers and, more recently, Das Übermensch in Operation Mincemeat, a showstopper performed with a German techno beat and Nazi boyband – “Third Reich on the mic” – vocals, present fascism as an essentially camp enterprise and we’re reminded this week that ICE fits the mould entirely.It’s always about the costumes, isn’t it? Here’s border patrol chief,Greg Bovino, swishing around Minnesotain his long, green trenchcoat– as Gavin Newsom, the governor of California put it, “as if he literally went on eBay and purchased SS garb” – while rank and file ICE agents were described by Keith Ellison, Minnesota’s attorney general, as prancing about in “full battle rattle”. The vests, the fatigues, the goggles; I swear most of these goons are only in it for the accessories and an opportunity to admire themselves and each other under cover of rugged co-combatant team spirit. Meanwhile, as Lydia Polgreen pointed out in the New York Times, their sheer incompetence adds a darkly slapstick layer to events via videos of, for example, large men dressed for war slipping on ice and going “ass over teakettle”.If you laugh in their faces you run the risk of being shot, but there’s nothing to stop it going on behind their backs. If I were an editor in New York I would send someone to Broadway to report on how recent events are affecting audiences at Operation Mincemeat – specifically, how they react to a line that passed unremarked in the London West End production, but has been stopping the show in the US: “If people like us just blindly follow orders, the fascists won’t need to bash the door down. They’ll have already won.”Friends who saw the show two weeks ago reported that the performance ground to a halt at this line as the entire theatre rose to its feet, screaming and clapping. One can only imagine how long the interruption is now.TuesdayJust when you think the world can’t get any more disappointing, here’s Nicki Minaj on stage withDonald Trump, supporting him at an event in Washington DC and declaring herself “probably the president’s number one fan”.Well, this a blow from the artist who gave us the lyric: “My anaconda don’t want none unless you got buns, hun.” Although it does, of course, usher her into the long, tawdry tradition of When Good Cultural Icons Go Bad. From Kanye to Roseanne and the enduring disappointment of David Mamet, whose swing to the right was a particularly bitter pill given he wrote the greatest line in stage history (“coffee is for closers,” from Glengarry Glen Ross). Still, if we got over the loss of Kelsey Grammer, we can get over Minaj.Thank God for lovely Deacon Blue, who, while on tour in Australia this week, were informed that Reform UK’s “first Scottish leader”, Malcolm Offord, had approvingly referenced their 1987 hit Dignity while making a speech in Glasgow. The Scottish band promptly issued the statement: “It appals usto see the lyrics of any of our songs being used to bolster a campaign and ideology which is completely at odds with what the song, and we as a band, believe.”A bit crushing for Offord, one imagines, who said he liked the song “for the message of working hard and saving up to make your dreams come true”, but was hazier about how, under a Reform government, a dinghy called Dignity sailing up the west coast would probably be stopped and turned back by UK border patrol.View image in fullscreen‘Of course she didn’t bring any snacks.’Photograph: Jumeau Alexis/Abaca/ShutterstockWednesdayFor some light relief from world events I just finished reading Murderland: Crime and Bloodlust in the Time of Serial Killers, by Caroline Fraser. The brilliant, fascinating, genre-defining book was published last year and posits that lead poisoning in the Pacific north-west caused the huge spike in serial killers in that region in the 1970s. It sounds bizarre, but Fraser is completely convincing and it’s beautifully written to boot. After the book, I turned to what feels like a companion piece, David Fincher’s Mindhunter on Netflix, which covers the same ground from the perspective of the FBI’s first serial killer profiling unit. (And, fun fact, it features Anna Torv, an actor I love who also happens to be Rupert Murdoch’s niece).The only downside to all this American grimness – 496 pages of murder followed by two seasons of more murder – is trying to readjust to daily life. I went down to my bin room this week to throw out the recycling and had to focus very hard on not picturing Ted Bundy, back from the dead and naturally hiding behind my bins, poised to jump out and get me.View image in fullscreen‘Manchester’s a long way that way, don’t worry about it.’Photograph: Carl Court/ReutersThursdayTo the Australian Open, where the first week was dominated by Naomi Osaka’sEdwardian jellyfish outfitand the second has been all Coco Gauff’s. The 21-year-old American and world No 3 was knocked out of the quarter-finals by the 31-year-old Ukrainian Elina Svitolina – a stunning upset, but not the main story from Melbourne.Backstage after the match, Gauff was caught on camera unawares as she repeatedly smashed her racket into the ground, trashing it with the methodical rhythm of someone hammering a nail into the floor. The fact it was 44C in Melbourne probably didn’t help her mood, and at the press conference afterwards she explained calmly that it was better for her to release her frustration in private – as she believed herself to have done – than courtside in front of young fans. In fact, Gauff’s actions strike me as the inadvertent provision of a public service. For anyone over-invested in the news cycle,watchingthe racket smash on repeat may prove cathartic.FridayIf the Golden Globes two weeks ago were mostly bleached of politics, Sundance this week made up some of the shortfall with “ICE Out” badges being worn by famous attenders, including Natalie Portman, Olivia Wilde and Zoey Deutch. A more useful list of names, perhaps, is that of thepeople who attendedthe other big-screen event of the week: the launch of Amazon’s Melania documentary at the White House. While Minneapolis burned, these people showed up to support Donald Trump: Eric Yuan, the head of Zoom, Lynn Martin, the president of the New York Stock Exchange, and Tim Cook, the chief executive of Apple.

You select vodka or gin. But really, you’re an adult, you select gin. A whisper of vermouth, then it’s chilled. A twist of lemon is added or an olive and her brine, then it’s served. And it’s served – we pray – with a sidecar.All martinis should have sidecars. You know when you get a martini and there’s only a sip in the glass and the rest is in a little baby carafe sitting on ice? That’s a sidecar and it should be the law.I love a martini. It’s simple. It’s strong. It’sverystrong. To order a sweet cocktail is to infantalise yourself. Act your age. Put the simple syrup down and have something stiff and drink it slow. The martini has been around for 150 years, after all, so who am I to deny her? You become unstuck in time drinking a martini. You are honouring the great drinkers that came before you. You’re an intellect with a martini. You’re chic. You’re posh.The truth of it is, the martini is actually such a degenerate drink. It’s straight up alcohol; the only thing that makes it feel classy is the glassware and the temperature. It’s boozehound behaviour dressed up in formal wear. If you were drinking lukewarm vodka out of a leftover soda bottle, we would say you had a drinking problem. But drink it ice-cold in a coupe glass and now you’re at Soho House. Now you’re patrician. Now you’re God.So why allow the full martini to idly sit in your glass, tending towards room temperature as time slips away? With each moment, she loses self-respect. With each sip, you inch towards debasement. The sidecar keeps indignity at bay. The bartender made it so: ice. Cold. And we must honour their artistry. A warm sip of gin and you start to lose the context of it all. What am I doing? Do I have a problem? Am I real? Is it all … worth it? The sidecar protects you. Fear not! You aren’t some pervert! You are an aristocrat. You’re the Eternal One.So to all fine drinking establishments, I plead: give my martini a cold little friend. Sidecars for all. And please,please.

It’s up to us to replace it responsiblyMark SurmanWhen bubbles burst, what comes next can be better, if we build it differentlyFri 30 Jan 2026 06.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 30 Jan 2026 06.06 ESTShareIt was December 1999. Tech investors were riding high, convinced that a website and a Super Bowl ad were all it took to get rich quick. Spending was mistaken for growth; marketing was mistaken for a business model. In just a few months, the dot-com boom would go bust:$1.7tn in market value vanished, and the broader economy took a $5tn hit.Yet something remarkable emerged from the wreckage. The post-crash internet wasn’t defined by speculation, but by creation: the rise of web 2.0 and open-source software – and the birth of platforms like Firefox and Wikipedia. The lesson is simple: when bubbles burst, what comes next can be better, if we build it differently.Today, history is repeating itself – this time with AI.The AI boom looks eerily familiar. Nearly 80% of stock gains in 2025 are concentrated in just seven companies – Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla, all of whom are vying for control of the full AI stack that will underpin our shared future –hardware, software, data, energy and infrastructure.This isn’t just about market share, it’s about who decides how billions of people learn, create and see the world.AI needs to augment rather than replace humans or the workplace is doomed | Heather StewartRead moreThat level of concentration should worry us all.And like the dot-com days, valuations are rocketing without clear paths to profitability. Companies are selling the fantasy that AI will replace human workers, even though95% of AI experimentsinside firms fail to reach production. And instead of building public-interest tools that expand human potential, much of the industry is generating what Cory Doctorow calls“productive residue”– a flood of synthetic media, misinformation and deepfakes.The problem isn’t AI itself; it’s the current economic logic behind it.This is not inevitable. It’s the result of an economic model that treats technology as an extractive industry – hoarding data, consolidating power and externalizing harm. The AI arms race is driven not by innovation, but by domination, favoring profit over humanity.A different economic model already existsThe good news is that an alternative model already exists. Around the world, open-source developers and mission-driven companies are building shared infrastructure for trustworthy AI – transparent, auditable and locally adaptable. They are proving that innovation need not depend on monopolistic control of data.This is evident in the companies leading the way, the founders building tools that are both values-driven and competitive. Companies like Hugging Face, which runs the world’s most widely used open-source machine-learning model and dataset hub; Flower AI, which enables decentralized, federated learning to challenge the dominance of centralized big models; and Oumi, which offers a fully open-source platform for building and deploying custom AI models on local infrastructure rather than closed clouds. And many more.These aren’t speculative bets; they’re seeds for a more sustainable, pluralistic tech ecosystem. It’s part of what we view as a double-bottom-line economic model for tech – an approach that values missionandmoney.Slop is not destinyIf history is any guide, the current frenzy will end the same way the dot-com boom did: with a crash. But that’s not the end of the story – it’s the beginning of a new one.In the last bubble, theLinux stack, the open-source building blocks that now underpin almost everything the internet, rose from the ashes to beat Windows. Open-source building blocks like these have createda stunning $8.8tnin value over the last two decades, withnew research estimatingtens of billions in value to startups and other businesses if they switch from closed AI platforms to open-source models.How much value can we create today? It’s enormous.When the AI bubble pops, we’ll face a choice. We can rebuild the same monopolistic model, or we can use the moment to design an economy that’s pro-human and values-driven. That means open models, transparent governance and equitable participation in the value AI creates.It also means focusing on what people actually want from technology: privacy, security, agency and joy. The promise of AI isn’t its infinite scale – it’s the ability to make our lives easier, richer, and more creative without sacrificing choice or dignity.This is already happening. As we experiment with privacy-protecting, open-source models for things like browser and email assistants, we see them getting better and better.Imagine a future in which individuals and communities can host small, local AI models – energy-efficient, privacy-preserving and tailored to their needs. Where developers build tools collaboratively, not competitively. Where innovation is measured not by market share, but by public good.That’s not a utopian fantasy. If we start now – building AI that’s open, transparent and rooted in shared values – we can ensure that the next era of technology expands human freedom instead of constraining it. The dot-com crash gave us the modern web. The next correction could give us a better one – if we have the courage to rethink the economics of innovation.In the end, the choice is ours. We can let a handful of companies own the future. Or we can own what we build – together.Mark Surman is the president of MozillaExplore more on these topicsAI (artificial intelligence)OpinionOpen sourcePrivacyInternetMozillacommentShareReuse this content"

No one has forgotten China’s increasing international forcefulness, its handling of the pandemic and its closer relations with Russia as war engulfed Ukraine. But the wildness of Donald Trump’s first year back in power isspurring Canada, France and others to hedge their bets. This, not whisky tariff cuts, is what the British prime minister sought. Mr Trump called the move “dangerous”, but threatens allies and describes Xi Jinping as a “friend”. Set beside this administration, Beijing looks no more benevolent but does appear relatively predictable.Yet the important news from Beijing in recent days was not Sir Keir’s visit but the news that Xi Jinping hadpurged its top general, Zhang Youxia. No one is too mighty to be ousted in a system which, while stable, looks increasingly like a“party of one”. The Chinese leader’s campaign has whittled the Central Military Commission, the top military body, from seven figures to just Mr Xi himself and the armed forces’ anti-corruption chief. He had already toppled officials at all levels of the party, including potential heirs, brushed aside term limits and fostered a personality cult. Now he is completely overhauling the People’s Liberation Army.Corruption in China had reached an astounding level when he took power. Graft in the PLA – including paying for promotion and skimming in procurement – appears both particularly entrenched and particularly risky. This may well help to explain the removal of rocket force commanders, overseeing China’s nuclear and conventional missiles, in 2023. But Chinese media say Mr Zhang and Liu Zhenli, another top military leader, “seriously trampled on and undermined the system of ultimate responsibility resting with the CMC chairman”: Mr Xi. As so often, the real offence was political. Yet Mr Xi has again removed his own appointees. It seems less likely that they were manoeuvring against him than that theymisread his wishes, or were seen as acting with insufficient zeal.One concern is that PLA turmoil makes basic relations and understanding between it and the US military harder. Direct military-to-military channels – cut off by China in 2022 – have yet to be restored, though the US says there is agreement to do so. While attention has focused on Chinese intentions towards Taiwan, a greater danger may be an unanticipated event, like the 2001 crisis when a US spy plane and Chinese fighter jetcollided: the means of deconfliction and de-escalation are essential.The broader worry is the thinning out or silencing of knowledge and expertise – Mr Zhang had rare combat experience, having fought in Vietnam, and heimpressed US counterpartswhen he visited. Some fear that military overconfidence and misunderstandings are the likely result.When strongmen are surrounded by sycophants and the scared, the risks to everyone grow. Mr Trump is a democratically elected leader constrained by the legislature and judiciary and held accountable by a free media – but attacks any check upon his power and follows advice only when it suits him. In his first term, he was challenged from within his administration; now it looks like a court. Yet still he must face dissent. Who inChinawould dare to use initiative – let alone differ with Mr Xi – when a highly experienced, well-connected fellow “princeling” repeatedly promoted by him has fallen so dramatically? Who would dare even to bear unwelcome truths?Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

A socioeconomic duty on public bodies was included in 2010’s Equality Act, but has never been enacted. NowClass Ceiling, a review from Manchester University, co-chaired by the former chief prosecutor Nazir Afzal, is calling for change. It wants class to be made a legally “protected characteristic” like race and sex (and several others), to address the class crisis in the arts – not just in the north-west but across the UK.The report tells a depressingly familiar story. A2022 studyshowed that the proportion of working-class actors, musicians and writers has halved since the 1970s;another in 2024found that fewer than one in 10 arts workers in the UK had working-class roots.Top-selling musicians are six times more likely than other people to have attended private schools, and Bafta-nominated actors five times more likely to have done so. The same is true behind the scenes: last yearGuardian analysisfound that 30% of artistic directors and creative leaders were privately educated.The metrics all reveal a dispiriting picture of a cultural landscape riven with inequality, exclusion and seemingly inexorable gentrification. Before 1960, according toone study, nearly half of opera singers came from working-class backgrounds. Today, asAdele Thomas, the recently appointed CEO of Welsh National Opera, hassaid, “you need a private income just to live”. Michael Sheen, who, like Thomas, comes from Port Talbot and whose inaugural production for theWelsh National Theatreopened this month, set up aprogrammeto support writers from working-class and other underrepresented backgrounds.Sheen,Julie WaltersandChristopher Eccleston, along with many other household names, have said their success would not be possible today. The closure of youth and regional theatres, and dwindling apprenticeships and grants have shut down avenues for aspiring artists. Unpaid work experience, zero-hours contracts, student debts and travel costs today make a creative career seem an impossible dream for many. Arts education has been shockingly devalued. Then there are the hidden benefits of the social confidence and networks afforded to the better off. Grayson Perrysummed it up: “The idea … that society will breed untaught geniuses is rubbish.”Calls for an end to unpaid work may not be new. But the Class Ceiling report is right to highlight the importance of ensuring that entry-level positions are not scooped up by those who can afford to volunteer. Jobs should be advertised to avoid cronyism. Creative work is skilled labour and deserves to be paid as such. Young creatives must be financially supported if they are to flourish.The recent announcement by the culture secretary, Lisa Nandy, of a£1.5bn funding package for the artsand the government’sdecision to scrap the English baccalaureateto boost creative subjects in schools have been broadly welcomed by leading arts figures. Ministers should address the report’s call for new legal protections. Making class a protected characteristic would give that recognition real force. We must do more than pay lip-service to socioeconomic diversity in the arts straight away. For years the cultural sector has relied on equality messaging. But as the Class Ceiling report states: “The language has improved. The outcomes have not.” For the sake of the Tracey Emins and Idris Elbas of the future, this has got to change.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Plus letters fromDominique E Martinon why markets in kidneys don’t work and a disgruntled altruistic living kidney donorFri 30 Jan 2026 11.54 ESTLast modified on Fri 30 Jan 2026 14.12 ESTShareIt is hard not to feel a certain sadness reading arguments for legalising the sale of kidneys that rely more on provocation than on engagement with how healthcare systems actually work in the UK (The big idea: Should we sell our kidneys?, 25 January).Kidney failure is devastating, and the shortage of donor organs costs lives. About7,000people in the UK arecurrently waiting for a kidney transplant, and six people die every week while waiting. It is therefore concerning to read an argument that implicitly accepts continued late diagnosis of kidney disease and progression to kidney failure as an inevitability, rather than recognising the urgent need to raise awareness of kidney disease and prioritise its prevention before lives reach crisis point.Furthermore, the notion that altruism in the UK has reached its limits, justifying a legal market for human organs, is not supported by public attitudes, social evidence or ethics.Kidney disease, and access to care, are already shaped by inequality. Dr Paul Sagar may recognise concerns about exploitation, but he does not answer the central ethical question. How can a system be just if it starts to depend on people under financial pressure selling their organs and allowing economic vulnerability to become the engine of organ supply, while the causes of kidney failure and unequal access to care remain unaddressed?Altruism is yet to have its day. Research by the Robert Dangoor Partnership for Living Kidney Donation has shown that more than half of UK adults would consider donating a kidney to a family member, nearly a third to a friend, and one in seven to a stranger. More than two-thirdsof people say they want to make a positive impact on the world, even when it comes at a personal cost.The issue is not the absence of altruism, but how effectively we inform and enable people to act on their existing willingness to help others by raising awareness and providing support for living kidney donation. Our work is making an active difference in this space, with support available throughdonateakidney.co.uk.Saving lives doesn’t mean monetising our organs. It demands investment in prevention, research, fair access to transplantation, and sustained support for ethical, voluntary donation.Sandra CurrieChief executive, Kidney Research UK“It turns out that the main arguments against legalising the sale of kidneys aren’t very robust,” writes Dr Paul Sagar. There are many arguments for and against the use of financial incentives for organ donation. Coherent debate, however, requires engagement with reliable empirical evidence. Unfortunately, in advocating for the introduction of markets in the UK, Dr Sagar’s case appears to rest on the assumption that payment for kidneys will inevitably ensure sufficient supply to meet the demands of people in need of kidney transplant. He bases this assumption on historical and unfounded claims that the Iranian market in kidneys eliminated the waiting list.Eliminating a waiting list is easy; one need only restrict the eligibility criteria for wait-listing. A recent study byAli Nobakht Haghighi and colleaguesreported 32,000 patients undergoing dialysis in Iran, with only 2,500 receiving a transplant each year; only 40% of those transplants were obtained from living donors. They also highlighted some of the concerns about the Iranian organ market, noting the limitations of market regulation in prevention of exploitation.The Iranian waiting list continues to grow, asAlireza Heidary Rouchiand colleaguesnoted more than a decade ago, in part due to better identification and referral of patients who would benefit from transplantation, but also to the rising burden of kidney disease. Around the world, the most effective way to reduce the gap between supply and demand for kidneys for transplant remains investment in prevention and management of kidney disease.Dominique E MartinProfessor in health ethics and professionalism, Deakin UniversityThe figures from theNHSin Paul Sagar’s article, that although 7,000 people in the UK require a kidney transplant, only 3,302 adult transplants took place in 2024/25, really angered me. Why? Because a few years ago I applied to be an altruistic living kidney donor, and the process was such a shambles and so disheartening that I gave up on the application, and they didn’t even bother to follow up. Almost two years ago I met someone who needed a kidney and she put me forward as her donor. Since then the NHS has been incompetent with her case and to this day continues to cause huge delays. This is without even vetting me to confirm I’m a suitable match, or if I’m even eligible to donate at all. It’s been an impossible battle. If the whole NHS donor system matches our experiences with it, I’m not surprised there’s so much need outweighing availability.Name and address suppliedHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

While politicians debate bans on social media for under‑16s, and teachers report children trying to swipe the pages of books, it is puzzling that the question of screen time in schools is left out of discussions.Every morning, most primary school children are greeted by an electronic whiteboard glowing in the classroom, often left on all day. Lessons are delivered as slides, tablets are used for activities, and many schools require homework to be completed online.When it rains, “wet play” means more screen‑based entertainment. Movement breaks are delivered via YouTube routines. The message is clear: learning, leisure and even physical activity all happen on a screen.Unsurprisingly, children internalise this as normal. We know excessive screen time harms children’s development and mental and physical health, just as we know free play and time in nature are greatly beneficial. Yet, under curriculum pressures, real‑world interactions are replaced by on-screen content. No social media ban will compensate for an education system that conditions four‑year‑olds to turn to screens for every task. Parents are urged to limit screens at home, but no equivalent guidance seems to exist for schools.As a parent, I am not calling for the abolition of technology, but for its purposeful, mindful use. Our children deserve an education that prioritises people, conversations, outdoor play and hands‑on exploration. We need to start asking: how much screen time is my child exposed to at school, and why?Kristyna SkriczkaLondonI am writing in response to your article on the impact of screen time on young children, to share my perspective as an educator experienced in working closely with children with and without special needs across a wide range of ages.Current research consistently shows that early and prolonged exposure to screens is associated with negative outcomes in children’s cognitive, linguistic, and socio-emotional development. Excessive screen use in the early yearshas been linked toreduced language acquisition, poorer attention and executive functioning, difficulties with emotional regulation, and weaker social engagement skills. These effects are observed across diverse developmental profiles, not only among children with identified needs.In my professional experience, these findings are reflected daily. I increasingly observe children struggling to process, produce and meaningfully use information, alongside challenges with attention, communication, social interaction and emotional regulation.Excessive screen use is also replacing human interaction, reducing opportunities for children to develop language, emotional skills and social connections. Over time, it may encourage individualistic behaviours and a preference for instant gratification over patience, collaboration and curiosity.At the same time, this issue cannot be framed as parental failure. Families face significant pressures, and screens often become a necessary coping tool. Technology will not disappear; the challenge lies in balance, awareness and shared accountability. Parents need clear, accessible information about developmental risks alongside practical alternatives. Responsibility must also extend to content producers and platforms.Thank you for bringing this important issue to public attention. Your article contributes meaningfully to a necessary and timely conversation about how we support children’s development and families in an increasingly digital world.Arianny Avrile SaviñònNew York, USHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Thirty years ago, on the night when my father died, we returned to the family house and were greeted by the unmistakable sound of a robin’s song.This threnody that greeted our return from the hospital was heard in bitterly cold February conditions – and this was after midnight. As a seasoned birdwatcher, it seemed very unusual to me to hear this song at that hour, but I couldn’t help attributing some deeper significance to it.Adrian HughesCastell Caereinion, PowysIn the weeks and months after my husband died in October 2024, like Amy-Jane Beer, I’m sure I was “visited”. Encounters with urban foxes – granted, not unusual in themselves – became much more frequent and weirdly more intimate. One settled in the garden for a few days, basking in the autumn sunshine and watched me closely. I saw them in the streets much more often. Then, in the frosty early morning of New Year’s Day 2025, I came face to face with one rounding a corner. We locked eyes. I tipped my hat and said, “Happy new year, Pete”. He strolled off and hasn’t visited recently.Jane CharterisLondonThank you, Amy-Jane Beer – you must have touched many readers’ hearts. Looking back nearly 20 years, I often wonder if I imagined that a robin visited me in my house, first thing after I got up, on the day of my husband’s funeral. Now I will stop doubting that memory. I join other readers in sending you sympathy, Amy-Jane, on the loss of your sister.Barbara M FosterWelwyn Garden City, HertfordshireHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

We understand the concerns around ensuring that the right conditions are in place for such a transition, which is why early clarity from the government on the path forward is essential.

Train operators said passengers who were due to travel on Friday could choose to use their tickets on Saturday instead.Services were able to run normally out of London by 4pm but some disruption remained because of earlier cancellations and delays.The fire was reported at 9.31am on Friday, according to the London fire brigade, which sent 10 fire engines and about 70 firefighters to tackle the blaze in Regent’s Park Road.The fire burned through a single-storey commercial building and most of a neighbouring property. There were no reports of injuries and the cause of the fire was under investigation, the brigade said.A witness, William Selas, 40, said that he could see a lot of fire and smoke from his bedroom window. “Oh my God, I saw so many firefighters come around,” he said. “Hopefully it’s going to be all right and we won’t have to leave the house or run away.”Explore more on these topicsRail transportTransportEnglandNetwork RailFirefightersLondonnewsShareReuse this content"

Previously the government and military had only provided figures for militants Israel claimed to have killed.Gaza health authorities said the direct toll from Israeli attacks had exceeded 71,660 people, with at least 10,000 presumed buried in the rubble of bombed buildings.For more than two years, Israeli officials and media hadattackedthe Palestinian figures as “Hamas propaganda” and dismissed them as “not accurate”.The abrupt shift in stance raises broader questions about Israel’s defence of its campaign in Gaza. A UN commission, rights groups andscholars have accused Israel of committing genocide in the territory.map of deaths“What other accusations could turn out to be true?” the Israeli newspaper Haaretzsaidafter the briefing. “The Israeli public must ask itself what this belated recognition indicates about the army and the government’s credibility regarding Israel’s conduct in Gaza.”It is also likely to intensify scrutiny of civilian casualties in Gaza. The Israeli military previously claimed to have killed 22,000 militants in Gaza, suggesting that, by its own count, more than two-thirds of the 70,000 dead were non-combatants.That figure is significantly below the 83% civilian tollindicatedby a classified Israeli military database, but well above the 50% casualty rate previously claimed by Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu.Israel was still reviewing how many of the dead were civilians, the Times of Israelsaid, but believed the overall toll compiled by Gaza health authorities was “largely accurate”.A military spokesperson declined to confirm or deny the figure given at the briefing, saying only that “the details published do not reflect official IDF data”.The Palestinian database does not provide a breakdown of fighters and non-combatants. It does identify most of the dead by name, date of birth and Israeli-issued identity numbers.number of childrenIsraeli attacks on Gaza health authorities ignored a long track record of reliable record-keeping. During past wars in Gaza the final toll recognised by Israel and observers including the UN was broadly in line with Palestinian data.There was little coverage or discussion of the death toll in Israeli media. Most major outlets attended the briefing, but with the exception of Haaretz, initially ignored the new figure.Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper quoted the figure in a report focused on diplomatic manoeuvring between the US, Qatar and Israel. The report quoted an official, saying: “Our estimate is that roughly 70,000 Gazans were killed in the war, not including missing persons.”The paper’s online outlet, Ynet, later published a shortpieceon the toll late on Thursday evening. It was not a headline on television news shows.The Israeli military also said it would open the key Rafah crossing between Gaza and Egypt on Sunday, for the first time since Israeli forces seized control of the border area nearly two years ago, in May 2024.Palestinians who left Gaza could now apply to return for the first time since the war began, a spokesperson said. A European Union force would supervise the crossing, but Israel would retain full control of everyone who entered and left, the spokesperson said.Reopening Rafah has been presented as a central part of US efforts to push Donald Trump’s ceasefire plan for the territory firmly into a second stage. It will only be open to pedestrians, so will not ease shortages of food and shelter aid, medicine and other basic humanitarian goods in Gaza.Explore more on these topicsGazaPalestineMiddle East and north AfricaIsraelHamasnewsShareReuse this content"

This plays an important role in infant development and is added to formula to ensure babies who are not breastfed receive it.The food regulator said the ongoing investigations had confirmed that the contaminated oil had come from an ingredient supplier used by both Nestlé and rival food group Danone. This month, Danone also recalled a batch of its Aptamil baby formula over the same concerns.“We are urgently tracing all products that may have used ingredients from this supplier to make sure any affected products are removed from sale,” said Jodie Wild, head of incidents unit at the FSA.The Nestlé products affected include SMA Advanced First Infant Milk, SMA Advanced Follow-On Milk, SMA Anti Reflux, SMA Alfamino, SMA First Infant Milk, SMA Little Steps First Infant Milk, SMA Comfort, and SMA Lactose Free.“Both recalls are due to the presence of cereulide, a toxin that can cause vomiting and nausea,” continued Wild. “If further recalls are needed, we will announce them immediately.”The FSA urged anyone who has bought the recalled formula to stop using it and switch to an alternative. They should contact their GP or NHS 111 if their baby has already consumed it.The batch numbers of the affected products in the UKcan be found on theNestle websiteor by visitingfood.gov.uk.Customers are advised to look for the corresponding code on the base of the tin or box for powdered formulas, or the base of the outer box and on the side or top of the container for ready-to-feed formulas.Nestlé insisted that it had “moved quickly and decisively” to voluntarily issue a recall notice on 5 January: “We want to reassure everyone that there has been no change to the scope or nature of this recall and we thank everyone who has got in touch with us for their patience and apologise again that we have had to take this action.”The FSA said the only batch of Aptamil affected was the 800g pack of First Infant Formula coded EXP 31-10-2026. Danone said on its website that to comply with the latest guidance it had decided to “withdraw from targeted markets a very limited number of specific batches” and parents could contact its careline if they had any questions or concerns.Explore more on these topicsFood & drink industryNestléFoodParents and parentingChildrennewsShareReuse this content"

It included a drawing of a naked woman pointing a bloodied knife at a baby with a noose around its neck, and coded writing on red electrical tape attached to the David Hume mausoleum and two nearby memorial stones.The guide emailed photographs of the vandalism to Edinburgh council and described the symbols as “satanic”.A group on Telegram purporting to be responsible for the vandalism of graves at unnamed cemeteries posted photographs of the same damage in a now-deleted channel. They shared examples of other disturbing drawings, including a naked woman grabbing the bloodied head of a baby, to which one member responded: “For EH1?” EH1 is the postcode in Edinburgh covering the historic Old Town.The group also posted photographs of strange paraphernalia found at the Old Calton burial ground, including nails hammered through red candles, chalked symbols and red tape in which the words “anti meta physical front” were printed.View image in fullscreenA candle found at the site.Photograph: suppliedEdinburgh council said there was no CCTV covering the area and the incident was not reported to the police because the damage was temporary.Margaret Graham, the council’s culture and communities convener, said: “I’m appalled that our historic Old Calton burial ground has been vandalised. As soon as the incident was reported, officers removed it immediately, and there have been no further incidents since.”The tour guide’s report to the council was made public through a freedom of information (FoI) request, which wasfirst reported by the Scotsman. The guide’s 19 November 2025 email said: “In case it had yet to be brought to your attention, I was guiding some guests today in the Old Calton cemetery and came upon some disturbing occult style paraphernalia attached to the David Hume mausoleum (pics attached).“I removed what I could but couldn’t hang around as I had guests so I suspect you’ll want to get someone over there as soon as possible. The structure itself also had some satanic (?) symbols painted on it.”The 18th-century cemetery, a category A-listed site, is the final resting place of several notable Scots, including the scientist John Playfair, the painter David Allan, and Hume, whose mausoleum was designed by the architect Robert Adam.Hume was an Enlightenment philosopher and historian. An Edinburgh building named after him wasrenamedafter the Black Lives Matter protests in 2020 over his “comments on matters of race”.Edinburgh council has been forced to close the cemetery, and the nearby New Calton burial ground, in the evenings after complaints of antisocial behaviour. The FoI request revealed that in May last year tour guides had reported “repeated acts of vandalism and aggressive behaviour by groups of teenagers … with some situations escalating to physical aggression, including stone throwing directed at staff and visitors”.In response to a complaint last August about the cemetery gates being locked at night, the council doubled down on the decision, saying: “There have been a number of serious assaults and injuries to tourists reported and response policing are not able to continue attending the number of calls they receive.”A guide who operates in Old Calton told the Guardian he had spotted a “strange” gathering outside the David Hume mausoleum on 16 January at 10pm when the cemetery gates were locked. He claimed four men in long white robes were kneeling by the mausoleum and lighting candles.“I don’t have any idea what they were doing. We just escaped,” said the guide, who did not want to be named. “There were several candles inside the mausoleum, and now there are always sage plants close to the mausoleum. Obviously I told all the guides to pay attention. Sometimes we have private tours in the night and it could be dangerous.”Explore more on these topicsEdinburghScotlandnewsShareReuse this content"

Everyone is thinking twice about going there at the moment.”May did not specify the particular dangers they might face, but his comments come at a time when many American citizens and foreign visitors fear violence from ICE agents or examination of their political beliefs, and the threat of mass shootings – 425 such incidents in 2025, killing 420 people and wounding 1,898 – remains ever present.The British dance music star Piri cited “what’s going on in the US right now” as a factor when she cancelled a US tour earlier this week. In 2025, the Hungarian classical pianist András Schiff cancelled US concerts, saying: “Due to the recent and unprecedented political changes in the United States, I feel morally obligated to withdraw from all engagements in the US.”Bad Bunny says he left US out of world tour due to fear of Ice raids at concertsRead moreAlso in 2025, Puerto Rican megastar Bad Bunny was asked by i-D magazine if the reason he didn’t schedule any US concerts last year was due to fears about deportation of Latino audience members. “Man, honestly, yes,” he replied. “There were many reasons why I didn’t show up in the US, and none of them were out of hate … But there was the issue of – like, fucking ICE could be outside [a concert]. And it’s something that we were talking about and very concerned about.”Numerous events celebrating Latin heritage and culture have been cancelled since ICE ramped up activity during Donald Trump’s second term, due to fears they will be targeted by anti-immigration agents.There are concerns beyond arts and cultural events, particularly around this year’s World Cup being hosted mostly in the US, and the implications for thousands of fans travelling from abroad.The US is seeing a collapse in tourism revenue. In May 2025, the World Travel & Tourism Council projected that the US would lose $12.5bn (£9.35bn) in international visitor spending across the year. Figures later in the year supported that fall, with International Trade Administration, a US government body, finding that international visitor spending dropped 5.5% in September 2025 compared with September 2024.Fears were compounded by the proposal by the US Department for Homeland Security and border officials to examine five years of social media activity by potential visitors to the US prior to being granted entry.Queen are currently on a break from touring, after the end of their Rhapsody tour which ran from 2019 to 2024, featuring Adam Lambert as frontman.As May describes, they have a rich history in the US. After breaking into the mainstream there with third album Sheer Heart Attack, they had five US Top 10 albums in a row, reaching No 1 with 1980’s The Game which featured two US No 1 singles: Another One Bites the Dust and Crazy Little Thing Called Love, the latter a clear homage to Elvis Presley and American rock’n’roll.Explore more on these topicsBrian MayPop and rockICE (US Immigration and Customs Enforcement)newsShareReuse this content"

In cold conditions, trees also enter a form of hibernation, with changes at a cellular level: cells dehydrate, harden and shrink, increasing their sugar concentration. This is the botanical equivalent of adding antifreeze, helping to prevent the formation of ice crystals.But when temperatures drop suddenly,trees may not have fully acclimatised. The outer layer of wood may still contain water, which freezes and expands, putting pressure on the structure of the tree. In severe cold the tree may give way, sometimes with an explosive sound, producing deep vertical gaps known as frost cracks. Frost cracking is especially likely on sunny days when the temperature of the sun-warmed bark drops rapidly as night falls.In his Encyclopaedia of Gardening from 1822, John Loudon described how a severe winter left many trees “miserably split and cleft”, literally breaking some in two, “attended with dreadful noises like the explosion of firearms”.Frost cracks can harm treesas they may be exploited by insects and fungi, but exploding trees are not dangerous to bystanders. Witnesses do say, however, that the sudden percussive sounds from a dark forest can be unsettling.Explore more on these topicsTrees and forestsWeatherwatchWinterSnowfeaturesShareReuse this content"

A statement from the Met Office said: “Fourteen-day forecasts are coming to theMet Office web and app in the coming months.“Recent research has highlighted how a probabilistic approach to forecasting could be beneficial for forecasts, particularly at this range, and better inform public decision-making around the weather.“We’re exploring how we can use this approach to provide 14-day forecasts via the web and app in the coming months.“We’re already communicating this approach to forecasts in our presented videos on YouTube via Deep Dive or on 10-day trend.“Developing communication of the forecast in this way is part of our role as the UK’s national weather forecaster, innovating weather science to help people to make better decisions to stay safe and thrive.”AI systems could use Met Office and National Archives data under UK plansRead moreMany weather apps and websites already offer a forecast for two weeks or more but the Met Office has until now refrained owing to challenges around accuracy.But new Met Office research has concluded that probability-based forecasts can better inform weather-based decision-making.Author of the new research, the Met Office science fellow Ken Mylne, said: “Most previous discussions on expressing probabilities in forecasts started from an assumption that they can be hard for people to understand and that expressing uncertainty could undermine people’s confidence in the forecast and therefore undermine their ability to make decisions.“However, this research suggests that this assumption is wrong. People can understand probabilistic forecasts and could indeed find it more useful for informing weather-based decisions.”Last October, the BBC announced it was to reunite with the Met Office for its weather forecasts and climate updates, eight years after the relationship between the two organisations ended.Artificial intelligence is now being used to develop advanced forecasting models aimed at producing weather outlooks faster and further into the future.Earlier this week, the tech companyNvidiaannounced its Earth-2 weather forecasting models, which it claimed will make forecasting faster and more accurate.In December 2024, Google DeepMind said itsAI weather program performed up to 20% betterthan theENS forecastfrom the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts.Explore more on these topicsMet OfficeUK weatherNvidiaDeepMindAI (artificial intelligence)newsShareReuse this content"

Whyte, whose son was five at the time, died in hospital three days later.Her mother described Majek as an “evil nightmare” in a statement made to court before he was sentenced on Friday.CCTV played at the trial showed Majek disappeared from view on a deserted platform for 90 seconds after 11pm so he could attack Whyte. She was found injured in a shelter on the platform by the driver and guard of a train that pulled in about five minutes after the attack.Jurors unanimously convicted Majek of murder and possessing a screwdriver as an offensive weapon. Passing a life sentence, Mr Justice Soole told Majek he had brought “devastation” to Whyte’s family. He described the attack as one of “vicious brutality” and the “intent was to kill”.The judge added: “You continue to deny that you were the assailant. The court is thus left with no explanation of what possessed you to murder a member of the hotel staff, who together with her colleagues, had been serving and helping you and your fellow residents. The evidence against you, in particular CCTV and DNA, was overwhelming.”Outside the court, groups of people waved England flags and far-right activist Tommy Robinson joined the crowds.Majek is said to have lied to the court about his age, claiming to be 19 despite age assessment putting him between 25 and 28.Rhiannon’s sister, Alex Whyte, said in a victim’s statement she was speaking on “behalf of me and my broken-hearted siblings Emma, Daniel and Cara, and Rhiannon’s two nieces and seven nephews. Most importantly for her now six-year-old son”.She said Majek carried out a “vicious and pitiless assault on a terrified and defenceless young woman who he claims never to have spoken to or noticed”.The trial heard Majek had been reported to security at the hotel after “spookily” staring at three female staff members for prolonged periods.No motive for the killing was given at the trial. Majek had brushed past Whyte earlier in the evening as he left the hotel to smoke. After inflicting fatal injuries on her, Majek walked to the Caldmore Green area of Walsall to buy beer and was recorded on CCTV seemingly wiping blood from his trousers.He returned to the hotel at 12.13am, changed his bloodstained flip-flops for trainers, and was seen dancing with other residents in the car park, within sight of emergency vehicles called to the station.Addressing Majek, Alex said: “I honestly feel that calling you demonic and inhuman is justifiable in the circumstances. What are we supposed to say? You brutalised Rhiannon and then partied as if nothing had happened. You celebrated. You might as well have danced on her grave.”Rhiannon’s mother, Donna Whyte, told the court: “Her name will not be forgotten, she will not be a distant memory. We will keep her alive in our memory. You, however, are an evil nightmare that will be put aside, known only for your cruel and malicious act.”Serco, which ran the hotel where Majek was being housed, said it stopped using it for asylum seekers the same month Whyte was killed.Speaking after the sentencing hearing, DCI Paul Attwell of British Transport Police said Whyte was “brutally and senselessly murdered” by a man who had “never shown any remorse or given any explanation”.“It was a frenzied, sadistic and unprovoked attack which her killer carried out on an innocent young woman he barely even knew,” he added. “He laughed, danced, joked around in a moment after what happened, and to this day, he’s never shown any remorse or given any explanation of why he decided to murder Rhiannon that night.“His callous indifference has played out every day in court for Rhiannon’s poor family to see in person. I would like to pay tribute to them once again for the extraordinary strength and dignity they continue to show in the face of one of the most truly traumatic things a family could ever have to go through.”Explore more on these topicsUK newsWalsallCrimenewsShareReuse this content"

However, the British crown has never issued a formal apology.The Crown’s Silence, a book published this week, details howmonarchs from Queen Elizabeth I to George IVused the trade in enslaved people to boost crown revenues and defend the British empire.It is believed that by 1807 the British crown was the largest buyer of enslaved people.Bell Ribeiro-Addy, the Labour Clapham and Brixton Hill MP who chairs the all-party parliamentary group for Afrikan reparations, said “personal sorrow” did “not befit one of the single greatest crimes against humanity”.“This isn’t about individuals but the monarchy as an institution,” she added. “What is needed is not simply an apology on behalf of the crown, but acknowledgment of this history and action to address its lasting legacy of global racism and inequality.“An apology could be a basis for the honest conversation and transformation we need to have as a country around this issue in a swiftly changing world.”The Runnymede Trust, which in September publishedReparations, a report offering a blueprint for reparative justice, said King Charles offering an apology would be “a welcome, symbolic first step”, but must be supported by action.They added: “Reparations is not about exacting collective punishment or confessions of guilt – a Crown apology should only be offered if there is an accompanying governmental promise to engage with the systemic work that needs to be done to see how the legacies of slavery have coded our economic and financial infrastructures, and to genuinely commit to their reform and transformation.”Liliane Umubyeyi, the director of African Futures Lab, also argued that recognition “cannot be sufficient on its own”, saying there was a “legal as well as moral obligation for reparations, as slavery has been formally recognised as acrime against humanityunder international law”.Carla Denyer, the Green party MP for Bristol Central, said a formal apology was “long overdue”, adding: “The descendants of enslaved people deserve nothing less.”Independent experts who work with the UN also say an apology is overdue.The researcher and human rights activist Michael McEachrane, of the UN permanent forum on people of African descent, said: “The growing global call for reparatory justice is not primarily about the past.“[It] is critical for a sustainable future as there is no force in human history that has contributed more to social, economic and ecological disparities than colonialism. This isn’t charity or ‘handout’ – it’s about partnership: Commonwealth nations and the UK building equitable futures together, acknowledging rather than erasing their shared history.”The human rights lawyer Dominique Day, of the UN working group of experts on people of African descent, said the legacy of slavery and colonialism was felt “in police killings, joint enterprise prosecutions, in the Windrush and Grenfell scandals, and more”.“An acknowledgment creates space for repair, and the possibility of moving toward an ethic of respect, compassion, and prosperity without exploitation,” she added.Later this year, the king is expected to face renewed calls for action to address the legacy of slavery from Caribbean and African nations at the Commonwealth heads of government meeting (Chogm) in Antigua and Barbuda.The historian Brooke Newman said she wrote The Crown’s Silence to lay out the “historical evidence” and “open up the conversation” on an issue that had fallen victim to “culture wars”. She said: “(Chogm) is going to be a moment for pageantry and protests; 2026 could be a key time for Charles to take action.”Buckingham Palace has been approached for comment.Explore more on these topicsSlaveryCotton Capital: ongoing seriesMonarchyRoyal NavyMilitaryKing Charles IIInewsShareReuse this content"

She pushed him away and locked herself in her car for the night before making a complaint to her superiors in the morning.The incident was not reported to police and Webber wrote a letter of apology to Beck. He was later promoted.Since Beck’s death, the MoD has set up a serious crime command and launched a violence against women and girls taskforce, and more recently has agreed in principle to remove the handling of serious complaints from the individual services.In the UK and Ireland,Samaritanscan be contacted on freephone 116 123, or emailjo@samaritans.orgorjo@samaritans.ie.

Authorities seized 700 boxes related to 2020 election results in the county, which Biden won.Democrats express alarm at Tulsi Gabbard’s presence at FBI elections office raidRead moreTrump’s national intelligence director, Tulsi Gabbard, was alsoseen at the county’s election office that day,drawing concern from Democratic lawmakers about partisan overreach.Brown was replaced the week before the service of the search warrant at the elections office,as first reported by the Associated Press.The personnel decision was not publicized by the FBI, and the AP said the reason for Brown’s removal was not immediately clear.Robb Pitts, the Fulton county board of commissioners chair, spoke out against the Trump administration’s decision to raid the office, arguing that it was unjustifiedpolitical retribution. Pitts also reaffirmed that, despite the search warrant, the county hadnothing to hide.“Fulton county elections are fair and lawful, and the outcome of the 2020 election will not change,” he said. “Period.”The Guardian has reached out to theFBIfor comment.Election integrity experts have said that the 2020 presidential race was the most secure to date. And dozens of legal challenges brought by Trump’s allies that sought to challenge his defeat in that election failed.Nonetheless, Trump continues to falsely claim that the 2020 election was rigged against him in favor of Biden.Trump has not questioned the integrity of the 2024 presidential race, which he won against Vice-President Kamala Harris after Biden dropped his re-election campaign late in the contest.Explore more on these topicsFBIGeorgiaTrump administrationUS politicsAtlantanewsShareReuse this content"

Alongside it will be the original typescript scroll of Kerouac’s The Dharma Bums, estimated to sell for between £218,000 to £364,000 ($300,000 to $500,000).Kerouac wrote the first draft of On the Road over three weeks in April 1951, taping together sheets of tracing paper to avoid changing pages as he typed. The novel, published in 1957 after extensive revision, became a touchstone of postwar American literature, and helped define the Beat generation’s rejection of conformity, materialism and social restraint.“This is the original and only scroll for the first draft of Kerouac’s masterpiece,” said Heather Weintraub, specialist in the Christie’s books and manuscripts department. “It’s widely considered to be the most iconic artefact of the Beat Generation, [and] one of the most celebrated artefacts in American literature. This scroll is one of the most important literary documents still in private hands.”“When you roll it out it actually looks like a road. There are no paragraphs or chapters and it uses the real names of the characters before the publisher asked Kerouac to change the names.”However, the return of the scroll to the auction block echoes an earlier controversy. In 2001, when the manuscript was last offered for sale, Carolyn Cassady – the former wife of Neal Cassady, the real-life inspiration for the novel’s Dean Moriarty – denounced the auction as “blasphemy”, arguing that the scroll belonged in a public library rather than a private collection. “Jack loved public libraries,” she said at the time, adding: “If they auction it, anybody rich could buy it and keep it out of sight.”Irsay, who died last year, was best known as the owner and CEO of American football team the Indianapolis Colts, a role he held for nearly three decades. He built the Jim Irsay Collection over many years, amassing manuscripts, instruments and cultural artefacts connected to key moments in 20th-century music, literature, film and sport, which he frequently loaned for public exhibition.“I personally hope that a public institution will buy it so it can be seen by everyone,” Weintraub said. “But we can also hope that if someone [privately] buys it they will follow Jim Irsay’s example and show it publicly – he toured it around for years.”Nearly 400 items from the Jim Irsay Collection will be exhibited free to the public at Christie’s Rockefeller Plaza galleries from 6 to 12 March, preceding the auctions.Other highlights from the 12 March sale include Paul McCartney’s handwritten lyrics for Hey Jude, an affidavit filed by McCartney in 1970 to dissolve the Beatles with annotations by John Lennon, Sylvester Stallone’s handwritten Rocky script notebook, and Jim Morrison’s journal.Explore more on these topicsBooksJack KerouacnewsShareReuse this content"

The SDF had previously controlled about a quarter of the country and all of its main oilfields, constituting a significant challenge to the fledgling state’s rule.It came after Syrian government forces swept through north-east Syria, aided by the Arab and tribal elements, shrinking the territory controlled by the SDF by about 80%. The SDF chose mainly to withdraw from Arab-majority areas but were preparing to defend Kurdish-majority cities from government forces, when the deal was struck on Friday.Under the agreement, both sides would pull their fighters back from frontlines in north-east Syria and government security forces would enter the cities of Hasakah and Qamishli, the strongholds of the Kurdish authority.The SDF would integrate into the army, and the Syrian state would absorb the civilian institutions of the Kurdish authority.2:33The 'ticking-bomb' Syrian prisons filled with IS suspects – video explainerA new military brigade in the Syrian army would be formed, which would include three SDF brigades, as well as placing SDF fighters under government command in Aleppo.The Kurdish authority has operated as a de-facto autonomous zone for about a decade, with its own governing institutions and armed forces. Under Friday’s agreement, the scope of its autonomy shrinks significantly and would be replaced by unitary rule from Damascus.In a bid to reassureKurds, one of Syria’s largest ethnic minorities, the deal also included “civil and educational rights for the Kurdish people, and guaranteeing the return of the displaced to their areas”.The agreement read: “The agreement aims to unify the Syrian territories and achieve the full integration process in the region by enhancing cooperation between the concerned parties and unifying efforts to rebuild the country.”The deal was praised by Tom Barrack, the US special envoy to Syria, who had been intensely mediating between the two sides over the last two weeks to stave off a full-scale war. He called it a “profound and historic milestone”.Barrack said in a post on X on Friday: “This carefully negotiated step, building on earlier frameworks and recent efforts to de-escalate tensions, reflects a shared commitment to inclusion, mutual respect and the collective dignity of all Syrian communities.”Friday’s agreement was more favorable to the Kurdish authority than previous ceasefire deals, and appears to have resulted from intensive diplomacy from the US and France, both of which maintain good relations from both sides. It also spelled a virtual end to the Kurdish-autonomous project of north-east Syria, but with relatively little bloodshed.Explore more on these topicsSyriaKurdsMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Powell’s second term as chair is due to end in May.Writing on his Truth Social platform,Trump said: “I have known Kevin for a long period of time, and have no doubt that he will go down as one of the GREAT Fed Chairmen, maybe the best. On top of everything else, he is ‘central casting’, and he will never let you down.”What is behind the extraordinary rise in investment into silver and gold?Read moreWarsh, 55, a formerFederal Reservegovernor who has deep ties to Wall Street, had previously interviewed for the job of chair in 2017 when the role went to Powell. Trump’s pick will have to be confirmed by the Senate.Being the chair of the Fed is one of the most powerful roles in the US government, with enormous influence over the world’s largest economy.Stephen Brown, a US economist at CapitalEconomics, said markets were likely to consider Warsh “a relatively safe choice” and his nomination would alleviate concerns that the president was going to pick “a full-blown Trump stooge” to be the next Fed chair.Mark Carney, the Canadian prime minister and former governor of the Bank of England, said in a social mediapostthat Warsh was “a fantastic choice to lead the world’s most important central bank at this crucial time”.The dollar strengthened early on Fridayafter it was reported that Warsh was expected to be Trump’s choice, and was up 0.5% against a basket of currencies after the nomination. Gold fell by 9.1% to $4,903.60 an ounce. Silver dropped 26.7% to $85.12 an ounce. Wall Street traded slightly lower, with the benchmark S&P 500 down 0.5% in New York.Warsh will still need at least 51 votes in the US Senate to be confirmed. Though Republicans have a 53-47 majority in the chamber, multiple Republican senators spoke indefenseof Powell after it emerged that the Fed chair is under federal criminal investigation. One senator, Thom Tillis of North Carolina, said he would block any of Trump’s Fed nominees until the investigation is called off.On Friday, Tillis said that Warsh was “a qualified nominee with a deep understanding of monetary policy” but said that he would still vote against him until Powell’s investigation is resolved.Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat and ranking member of the Senate’s banking committee, said in astatement: “No Republican purporting to care about Fed independence should agree to move forward with this nomination.”Warsh has warned about inflation risks in the US in the past, but has also echoed Trump’s critique of the Fed for being too slow to cut interest rates. High interest rates can alleviate inflation at the risk of upping unemployment. Rates are currently at a range of 3.5% to 3.75%, which most economists at the Fed currently see asneutralto prices and unemployment.Since resigning from the central bank in 2011 over its post-financial crisis stimulus package, Warsh has criticised it publicly on multiple occasions. In April last year, he issued a stinging attack,sayingthe institution’s central bankers should not be treated as “pampered princes” and it too regularly “opines on matters outside its remit” which has led to “systemic errors” in its main role of trying to keep prices stable.View image in fullscreenA video of the Federal Reserve chair, Jerome Powell, plays on a screen on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange on 12 January.Photograph: Richard Drew/APWarsh, a New Yorker who was special assistant for economic policy from 2002 to 2006, served as Fed governor between 2006 and 2011, a period that included the response to the global financial crisis, and was its representative to the G20 group of countries.He is now a lecturer at the Stanford Graduate School of Business and has roles at the courier UPS, the Korean e-commerce company Coupang and the Duquesne Family Office, the investment firm of the billionaire Stanley Druckenmiller.Warsh is married to Jane Lauder, the granddaughter of the cosmetics magnate Estée Lauder and daughter of Ronald Lauder, the billionaire who has interests in Greenland andencouraged Trump to attempt to acquire the territory.Other candidates on the shortlist to be Federal Reserve chair had been Kevin Hassett, the national economic council director; Christopher Waller, a Fed governor; and Rick Rieder, an executive at BlackRock.Warsh has been a longtime critic of the ultra-loose monetary policy pursued by the Fed since the financial crisis, including the central bank’s expanded balance sheet. He had previously been seen as a monetary policy hawk, but appears to have aligned himself with the White House’s push for lower borrowing costs.In December, Trump said of Warsh: “He thinks you have to lower interest rates.”Renaissance Macro Research said in a note that Warsh could have been siding himself with the president to appease him. “Warsh has been a monetary policy hawk his entire career and most importantly, during a time when the labor markets fell out of bed,” it said. “His dovishness today stems from convenience. The president risks getting duped.”Brown said Warsh’s “long-running hawkish views should help to counteract concerns that he might morph into a full-blown Trump stooge.“That said, his firm conviction that both AI and the Trump administration’s regulatory push will help to hold down inflation, as well as his longstanding view that the Fed should operate with a much smaller balance sheet, present the risk of some upward pressure on long-term bond yields.”Trump himself had suggested that he was considering whether to install Hassett, a White House official and one of his top economic advisers, as Fed chair.On Friday, Trumpwroteon social media: “Their [sic] was great speculation that highly respected Kevin Hassett was going to be named Chairman of the Fed, and a great Chairman he would have been but, quite honestly, he is doing such an outstanding job working with me and my team at the White House, that I just didn’t want to let him go.”Explore more on these topicsFederal ReserveDonald TrumpUS economyJerome PowellEconomicsUS interest ratesDollarnewsShareReuse this content"

The deal was expected to form part of talksduring Keir Starmer’s visit to Beijing, although no deal has been announced.In June, Chery UK director, Victor Zhang, said the carmaker was“actively considering” building a plant in the UKas part of a “localisation” strategy. In a statement, Gong Yueqiong, the general manager of Chery Commercial Vehicle, said: “We are not just bringing products to the UK – we are building a British business.”The business secretary, Peter Kyle, has discussed the potential deal withJLR’s new chief executive, PB Balaji, according to a person with knowledge of talks. Balaji, formerly an executive in JLR’s Indian owner, Tata Motors, is thought to have said JLR would be open to the move, if it were to benefit the business, although the person added that they did not believe anything concrete had been agreed.David Bailey, a professor of business economics at the University of Birmingham, said any deal would probably involve using spare capacity at JLR’s factory in Halewood, also on Merseyside. He said the Chery headquarters announcement was “very good news”, but cautioned that he also believed that no manufacturing deal had been finalised.“They’ve talked about localisation,” he said. “Potentially there’s scope to use the JLR spare capacity.”The Halewood factory produces smaller Land Rover variants, the Discovery Sport and the Range Rover Evoque. The factory in 2017 produced more than 200,000 vehicles, but it only produced a small fraction of that in 2025. JLR production ground to a halt in the final quarter of last year after acyber-attack stopped all operations for weeks.Liam Robinson, the leader ofLiverpoolcity council, said: “Chery Commercial Vehicle’s choice of Liverpool for its commercial vehicle European base is a major vote of confidence in our city’s capabilities, our workforce and our long-term vision for clean, inclusive growth.”Ford also makes transmissions and electric drive units for vans next door to JLR, while Stellantis, the owner of brands including Vauxhall, Fiat and Peugeot, makes vans in Ellesmere Port across the River Mersey.Gong said: “Our ‘In UK, For UK, Be UK’ strategy reflects our belief that true globalisation comes from deep localisation. By recruiting local talent, collaborating with UK institutions, and adapting to local needs, we aim to become a valued contributor to the UK’s automotive industry and economy.“Our strategy reflects our confidence in the UK’s talent, infrastructure, and commitment to green technology.”JLR declined to comment.Explore more on these topicsAutomotive industryJaguar Land RoverLiverpoolChinaGlobal economyInternational tradeInvestingnewsShareReuse this content"

The venture quietly continued, a 2005Guardian investigation revealed, even as the US government publicly warned North Korea was funding terrorism and imposed sanctions on the country. Amid mounting international pressure in 2007, the company claimed it was ending business in North Korea, but secretly continued its operation through a subsidiary, the US justice departmentsaid in 2023. BAT’s venture in North Korea provided about $418m in banking transactions, “generating revenue used to advance North Korea’s weapons program”, Matthew Olsen, then the justice department official in charge of its national security division, said during a 2023 Senate hearing.In 2023, BAT entered into adeferred prosecution agreementand along with the subsidiary, which pleaded guilty,agreed to paythe US $629m in fines for conspiring to violate sanctions and bank fraud.“On behalf of BAT, we deeply regret the misconduct arising from historical business activities that led to these settlements, and acknowledge that we fell short of the highest standards rightly expected of us,” Jack Bowles, then the company’s chief executive, said in a statement at the time. “Adhering to rigorous compliance and ethics standards has been, and remains, a top priority for BAT. In recent years we have transformed our compliance and ethics programme, which encompasses sanctions, anti-bribery, anti-corruption and anti-money laundering. The significant steps already taken, as well as the continued refinements to the programme that will be made as part of these settlements, will leave us even better equipped to lead a responsible and sustainable business.”The civil lawsuit filed on Thursday seeks compensationunder a federal lawthat allows victims of terrorist attacks to not only sue the organization allegedly responsible for damages, but also any third parties said to have aided and abetted, or conspired to assist, in an act of terrorism.“This case alleges a clear nexus between BAT’s clandestine scheme inNorth Koreaand the weapons used in deadly terrorist attacks,” said Ryan Sparacino, a lawyer at Sparacino PLLC who is representing the plaintiffs.The lawsuit argues BAT should be liable for damages because North Korea used profits from the cigarette venture and cigarette smuggling to fund the development of weapons of mass destruction for Iran’s revolutionary guard and Hezbollah. The complaint says those weapons were used in attacks on 8 January 2020 on the al-Asad airbase and Erbil airbase in Iraq and a 2022 missile attack in Kurdistan. Morethan 100 soldiers were diagnosed with traumatic brain injuriesin the 8 January 2020 attack and more than a dozen people were killed.Many more were injured in the 2022 attack in Kurdistan.“The devastating harm caused by terrorist violence does not fade with time – families carry it every day,” said Raj Parekh, the former acting US attorney for the eastern district of Virginia and a partner at Sparacino PLLC who is also representing the plaintiffs in the case. “This case is about pursuing justice for American service members, civilians, and their loved ones, and about seeking accountability for conduct that allegedly enabled the terrorist attacks against them.”“We do not comment on potential or pending legal claims,” a BAT spokesperson said.The plaintiffs include about 200 service members who suffered a range of injuries from the attacks, including traumatic brain injuries and post-traumatic stress disorder. Also included among them is the widow and the estateof a man killedwhile assisting refugees during the 2022 attack in Kurdistan. Several family members who also say they suffered harm from the attacks are plaintiffs as well.“Defendants knew – or recklessly disregarded – that by operating an illicit joint venture with a North Korean state-owned tobacco company, they were financing the missile and rocket attacks carried out by the IRGC and Hizballah against Americans,” says the lawsuit, which was filed in federal court in the eastern district of Virginia. “For at least a decade, Defendants persisted in this scheme, funneling hundreds of millions of dollars to North Korean terrorist fronts financing missiles used to attack Americans, including Plaintiffs, and defying repeated warnings that their conduct would enable these attacks.”In 2023, the US supreme courtunanimously ruledthat victims of a 2017Islamic Stateattack were not entitled to damages from Facebook, Twitter, and Google. The plaintiffs argued the companies were liable for damages because they knew IS was using their platforms for recruitment and did not do enough to stop it. The supreme court said that inaction was not enough – the plaintiffs had to show that the companies “consciously and culpably” assisted in the terror act to make it succeed.Last week, a federal appellate court in the District of Columbiarevived a lawsuitseeking damages against pharmaceutical companies who are alleged to have funded terrorism in Iraq by paying bribes to a Hezbollah-controlled militia to win contracts at the ministry of health. The companies deny wrongdoing.The suit against BAT argues the company knew its money was funding terrorism and continued the venture anyway. It points to numerous public statements, as well as public and private reports. The company was also aware of reports and public statements detailing North Korea’s support for terrorism, the suit alleges.“Its in-house personnel closely monitored US government and media reports, and its own corporate filings confirm it was acutely aware of the terrorist finance risks presented by the illicit cigarette trade,” the complaint says.Explore more on these topicsBritish American TobaccoNorth KoreaUS militarynewsShareReuse this content"

Now a palatial hotel, it is just over a mile from the town and its Pampelonne beach, where the director Roger Vadim shot the film And God Created Woman, launching Brigitte Bardot to stardom.The property’swebsitestates it was originally commissioned by the wealthy cognac trader Gabriel Dupuy d’Angeac as a wedding gift to his daughter Louise and her husband, Henry Brisson de la Messardière, a cavalry officer.

The occasion was a celebration and reconsideration of the Harlem Renaissance, the watershed African American cultural movement of the 1920s. The guest list included its still-living luminaries, some of the 20th century’s most influential – and still underappreciated – musicians, performers, artists, writers, historians and political leaders, all in their sunset years. Over four hours and untold glasses of wine, talk wheeled freely from vivid recollections to consternation, lively anecdotes to contemplations of ongoing struggle. Greaves, by then niche renowned for his innovatively meta documentary Symbiopsychotaxiplasm: Take One, lightly directed the conversation but otherwise let the energy flow. He considered it the most important footage he ever recorded.Seized review – captivating documentary goes inside a shocking newspaper raidRead moreYou could probably release that remarkable footage in full, completely unedited and unstructured, and still have a good documentary; every piece is now, 50 years later – the same distance to us as the Harlem Renaissance was to them – a bridge to a time no living person can remember, each face and gesture informed by decades of aftermath no straightforward nonfiction film on the period could capture. But Once Upon a Time in Harlem, directed by Greaves’s son David, who was one of four cameramen that day, manages to seamlessly clip and contextualize the party into 100 mesmerizing minutes. It’s both a sublime hang-out of a film and a celebration of individual achievements, a fascinating map of a long-ago scene and a referendum on legacy.That this sumptuous footage, allowed room to breathe, exists at all feels like a miracle; that it takes shape here as a coherent, inventive yet straightforwardly informative film is an intergenerational feat. The footage was originally shot but not used for his 1974 film From These Roots, but William Greaves always intended to shape it – fly-on-the-wall observations and direct interviews – into a Harlem Renaissance retrospective, but fell ill before he could complete it; when he died in 2014, at the age of 87, it passed to his widow Louise, who continued work until her own death in 2023, at the age of 90. Now David, along with his daughter Liani Greaves as producer, serve as stewards of William’s archive, supplemented by grants and community funding.They smartly stay out of the way, merely adding nametags and archival photographs as footnotes to the discussions at hand. The structure of the film, which premiered at theSundance film festival, follows the arc of the party; tentative, polite greetings and warm memories eventually give way to impassioned discussions, even arguments – should they still use the loaded word “negro” even though it was demeaning, or convert to “Afro-American”? – as well as tipsy crosstalk, all within a relaxed atmosphere of hard-won camaraderie. Occasionally, the Greaveses include welcome clips of William lightly prompting conversation to the more tentative guests on, say, the revolution that was jazz music. “It would be considered a revolution in relation to other music,” says the painter Aaron Douglas. “It was not a revolution to us”I am tempted, at this point, to just keep quoting extensively from the many subjects, whose personal histories, stories and inside jokes need no summary. Among them: the musicians Eubie Blake and Noble Sissle, whose 1921 musical Shuffle Along was one of the first all-Black Broadway shows; the historians Nathan Huggins and John Henrik Clarke; the poets Arna Bontemps and Frank Horne (uncle of Lena Horne); the actors Leigh Whipper and Irvin C Miller; the photographer James Van Der Zee; the librarians Regina Anderson and Jean Blackwell Hutson; the society page editor Gerri Major and Ida Mae Cullen, the widow of poet Countee Cullen. They speak of departed friends and figures – some long gone, such as the controversial Pan-Africanist Marcus Garvey, and some, such as the poet Langston Hughes, only a few years past. Some, like the 96-year-old Whipper, had parents who were enslaved, their inclination toward the arts a very expression of liberation.To watch them grapple, in real time, with what happened then and what it means now (the participants being somewhere between their 60s and Whipper’s 96 years old, they are amusingly consternated by the ignorance of the youths), is a faultless, captivating experience. The Harlem Renaissance, says Major, was the first time Black people were recognized as creative people. According to Bontemps, it was a “prism” of the Black experience from all time. Schuyler viewed it as not a renaissance at all but an “awakening”. Whatever the view, it eventually looped back to concerns of ongoingness – whether the cultural flourishing died on the vine or carried forward into the fraught present. “The Harlem Renaissance isn’t dead,” Huggins argues, “because the Harlem Renaissance lives with everybody.” Fifty years later, every person at the party now gone, Once Upon a Time in Harlem keeps that flame alight.Once Upon a Time in Harlem is screening at the Sundance film festival and is seeking distributionExplore more on these topicsSundance 2026First look reviewDocumentary filmsSundance film festivalFestivalsreviewsShareReuse this content"

On the walls, a framed Black Panther comic page he penned glints under glass near a portrait of Jamie Foxx – a souvenir from Hudlin’s stint producing Django Unchained – and a piece of theMartin Luther Kingmemorial that he was gifted while shooting the Disney sports drama Safety. “Look, I’m pleased with my life,” he tells me with a wry smile. “But honestly it’s taken a lot of trickery to get people to let me do these crazy things. It’s taken a lot of effort, but the reward is always worth it.”‘Kids referenced it as they asked for condoms’: the makers of cult hip-hop film House Party look backRead moreHudlin may be the nearest thing in Hollywood to a real-life Forrest Gump, given the things he’s done, the folks he’s worked with and the history he’s made. On Marvel Comics’Black Panthergraphic novel, Hudlin was the writer who repositioned the franchise as an explicit Black empowerment allegory, laying the foundation for Ryan Coogler’s blockbuster feature films. On the big screen, Hudlin has directed Eddie Murphy in Boomerang, Samuel L Jackson in The Great White Hope and Chadwick Boseman in Marshall.On the small screen, Hudlin helped launch the arch Boondocks comic strip on Adult Swim before taking over as the president of entertainment at BET – guiding the network’s strategic turn toward award shows and reality television. “You understand the importance of looking at your studio as a partner and not an opponent,” he says of the lessons learned before pivoting to Skydance’s controversial acquisition of BET’s parent company, Paramount. “There are gonna be alotof changes, but I still think that BET is important and hasn’t remotely reached the potential of how great and globally important it can be.”View image in fullscreenChristopher Reid and Tisha Campbell in House Party.Photograph: Everett/ShutterstockUltimately, the 64-year-old owes his long and varied career to House Party, the 1990 teen comedy that shattered industry prejudices around the viability of Black film on the way to becoming a cultural touchstone. At a time when Black expression on film stretched from slave narratives to Spike Lee joints, House Party centered Black youth, friendship and joy, preserving hip-hop’sdaisy-age exuberance– with yin-yang duo Kid ’n Play, AKA Christopher Reid and Christopher Martin, pointing the way. This week, Hudlin’s debut film enters the Criterion Collection with a 4K restoration, commentary from the director and his brother Warrington (a House Party producer), and a cast reunion.House Party still resonates,on TikTokand beyond. NFL stars Jalen Hurts and AJ Brown revived the trademark Kid ’n Play dance fora touchdown celebrationduring the Philadelphia Eagles’ Super Bowl march last year. To mark the film’s 30th anniversary in 2020, future second gentleman Doug Emhoff retweeted a clip from the seminal dance scene andshouted outHudlin’s wife, Chrisette, for setting him up on a blind date with a California state’s attorney named Kamala. “Doug’s a great guy, Kamala’s a great lady,” Hudlin says, “and now we get to all hang out as couples on double dates. I’m just grateful about the whole thing.”Hudlin comes from a long line of high achievers. His great-great-grandparents were conductors on the underground railroad, and his great-uncle Richard was a trailblazing college tennis player who went on to coach Althea Gibson and Arthur Ashe. Hudlin grew up in the historic Mississippi River town of East St Louis, Illinois, dreaming about making movies as Warrington, nearly a decade his senior, went off to Yale to study film in the early 70s. Warrington would phone home, and Reginald would turn those long-distance check-ins into exhaustive pitch meetings. “I had alotof ideas,” he remembers. “Finally one Christmas, he gave me a book; I opened it, and it was blank. He said: ‘Stop telling me your ideas. Write them down.’”Hudlin carried the notebook to Harvard, jotting down scenes with friends, snatches of ear-hustled dialogue and other “cool moments”; they would become for his senior thesis film titled House Party, about a Black teen who sneaks away from home to attend an epic fete. Three years later, She’s Gotta Have It was released in theaters to widespread acclaim and had Hollywood clamoring for the next Spike Lee with a fresh perspective on the Black experience. Seeing his opening, Hudlin pitched his short and a feature-length script treatment to all the major studios and got rejected by everyone but a junior executive named Helena Echegoyen; she wound up convincing her bosses at New Line Cinema to advance Hudlin $2.5m.The modest budget wasn’t going to attract any major stars to the film even if the Harvard grad somehow managed to intrigue someone on the level of Murphy or Sidney Poitier or even the up-and-coming Will Smith. “The only Black stars that existed back then weregiantstars,” Hudlin says, “and it’s not like there were a bunch of Black teen stars we could turn to either. Even BET was not in the hip-hop business yet.” So he turned to Video Music Box – a New York-based showcase for hip-hop acts – and immediately gravitated toward Reid and Martin, their hair, their moves. “I knew a girl who knew them, and she was like, ‘They show up on time,’” Hudlin recalls. “That’s all I needed to know.”The ensemble cast was a mix of bright young talents (future sitcom leadsTisha Campbell and Martin Lawrence), music royalty (George Clinton, Bowlegged Lou) and bold performers on the verge of wider fame; arguably, none was more cherished than the comedian Robin Harris – who died a week after House Party’s release from cardiac arrhythmia while aged 36. “He had this whole Red Foxx/Rodney Dangerfield thing going on, like he had just been thawed out of a block of ice,” says Hudlin, who had been developing another project around Harris’s biographical standup routine calledBebe’s Kids. “It was originally supposed to be a live-action film starring him. But when he passed, we said, ‘Let’s keep him alive so the people don’t forget his name.’”At age 28, Hudlin saw his debut feature gross $26m at the box office and prove that stories about Black middle-class acceptance and aspiration could flourish without centering trauma and subjugation. Mainstream audiences were thrilled by the movie’s candy-colored outfits and set designs, and intimate camerawork that dropped viewers right on the dancefloor. Meanwhile, a soundtrack (remember those?) featuring LL Cool J, Flavor Flav and other turn-of-the-decade hitmakers peaked at No 4 on the US R&B charts.View image in fullscreenThe cast of Boomerang.Photograph: Cine Text/Sportsphoto/AllstarHouse Party paved the way for a Black comedy film boom that would come to define the early 90s and help set the tone for wider conversations around safe sex. But even as films like Bebe’s Kids, Meteor Man and Boomerang rode the House Party wave, Hudlin could nonetheless feel the shift in tide as New Jack City and Friday were released in theaters around that same time with gangsta rap stars at the fore.“House Party was a celebration of the happy rap era, where you just made songs about going to parties and meeting girls,” he says. “To me it was an underrated era of music history. But with the success of Ice-T and NWA, that whole vibe shifted. The culture moved away from it. But these things are just phases, you know. They come back.”But amid the ebb and flow of popular tastes, an appetite for House Party has endured. The original film would spawn four sequels, the last two non-theatrical releases. In 2023, New Line released a rebooted version of the original film for contemporary audiences that wasco-produced by the NBA’s LeBron James(who played himself in the film) and featured a cameo from Kid ’n Play – one in a slew of callbacks to their celluloid breakout down the years.For it all to culminate with the first House Party entering the Criterion Collection makes for quite the career souvenir for Hudlin. But he’s not one to linger on past accomplishments, even with reminders all around. “I haven’t done a superhero movie, I haven’t done science fiction,” he says when I ask if there’s anything left on his to-make list. “I haven’t done a full-on, no-holds-barred musical. There’s a couple of big dramas I wanna do. I have a really long list.”House Party is out on 4K Blu-ray now in the US and in the UK on 2 FebruaryExplore more on these topicsFilmBlack US cultureHip-hopBlack PantherinterviewsShareReuse this content"

All her staff dress in deference to her, mostly in black, but sometimes – as in the case of her interior designer – in a matching camel-coloured three-piece suit. Candidates interviewing for assistant roles have also got the memo, lining up in a sea of monochrome, with buttery hair and prominent cross necklaces.View image in fullscreenMelania and helper.Photograph: AmazonMelania review – Trump film is a gilded trash remake of The Zone of InterestRead moreShe dislikes anything baggyAbout 30% of the film is devoted to high-stakes fittings for her inauguration outfits. “My creative vision is always clear and it’s my responsibility to share it with my team so they can bring it to life,” Melania explains in voiceover. This translates to her telling them to cinch stuff in. “More tension, tighter,” she commands a collar. A coat needs to skim nearer her hips. A hat brim is reprimanded as “a little bit wiggly-woggly”. “I don’t know if we can cut it,” frets one assistant tailor about a blouse, to stressed violins on the soundtrack.She’s uninterested in cateringWhile we are told that Melania is apparently in charge of everything about the inauguration-adjacent parties, we learn nothing of the menu save for the fact that the appetiser at one ball will be a golden egg, placed in an eggcup, on a plate. The first lady has no notes about this – what has laid it, whether it’s actually edible, if something alongside it might be nice – other than approval of its colour. She never eats or drinks.View image in fullscreenMelania walks down a corridor.Photograph: AmazonShe’s a gifted interior designer“It’s important that timeless elegance shines through every element,” Melania shares of the planning of one ball, while giving approval to invites being posted out in gigantic red envelopes, such as a primary school class might choose to send their lists to Santa in bulk. She’s insistent rugs are cleaned and furniture steamed in the brief window between the Biden’s leaving the White House and the Trumps trooping back in. Other evidence of her expert touch comes in a glimpse of Renoir’s black-and-white-tastic La Loge, which occupies a wall of her office. It’s a print: the real thing is in the Courtauld Gallery in London.She and Donald are very closeAt one moment, Melania places her hand on her husband’s waist in a careful and significant gesture that is movie-shorthand for “we still have sex”. Filmgoers can also witness their continued passion when Donald attempts to negotiate her big hat and lean in for a kiss. “Nobody has endured what he has endured over the past few years,” she reports in sympathetic voiceover. But for most of the film, the couple are apart. He phones her at one point to brag about some sort of immense domestic political victory. “Great, well done,” she says, in the manner of someone trying to get a cold-caller off the line.She and Barron are very closeView image in fullscreenBarron Trump at an inauguration parade.Photograph: Evan Vucci/APMelania’s son says not a word in the film, but is seen in much of the final reel, bending gently like he’s cosplaying Igor. At one point his proud parents discuss him in the back of a limo. “He’s cute, we have cute conversations,” says the president. “Yeah, I love him,” his mother reveals.Her favourite artist is Michael Jackson“I met him once with Donald,” she tells the film’s director Brett Ratner in the back of a limo on the way to Mar-a-Lago. “He was very sweet, very nice.” Her favourite songs are Billie Jean and Thriller, she adds, before she and Ratner briefly duet on the former, like Carpool Karaoke on the highway to hell.She’s really at home in blackThe 20 days shown in the film include one spent at Jimmy Carter’s funeral and an afternoon at a memorial ceremony at Arlington cemetery. All coverage of the former is devoted entirely to a meditation on mourning her own mother, who died a year ago that day. It includes a very lengthy sequence in which she books out St Patrick’s Cathedral in New York so she can stalk around in private reverie, watched by stony security guards and grinning priests. At Arlington cemetery meanwhile, she cuts an unmistakably mafioso figure, striding in stilettos beneath a brolly and nodding significantly at strangers. The perkiest she gets during inauguration day itself is when she’s walking through a crypt.Amazon gets some of its money’s worthView image in fullscreenGetting his screen time in … Jeff Bezos.Photograph: Stefano Rellandini/AFP/Getty ImagesWhatever they’re losing in profits and credibility through distributing the film, Amazon head Jeff Bezos is at least glimpsed a couple more times in the movie than his tech mogul peers. That said, there’s a leg up for Apple CEO Tim Cook also as Melania makes video calls about campaigns to limit children’s screen time on her MacBook Air (raised to eye level on a copy of her autobiography).One adult for the 9.40am in Sittingbourne: a front row seat for Melania’s ominous UK openingRead moreMelania is not apoliticalAs well as constantly referring to herself as a world leader, and lengthy pre-credits title cards totting up her accomplishments, Melania makes a number of dramatic statements about her ambitions in office. These include the desire to “break all norms”, totally reinvent the role of first lady and consider how lawmakers might better do their jobs – something she thinks about “constantly”. Judging by the genuflection of those around her, such a self-image is not entirely unwarranted. “I’ll go everywhere with you, no problem,” Brigitte Macron tells her over video call – and she does mean policies, not sightseeing. Nor is Melania above including snarky shots of her husband’s predecessors: we see Barack Obama looking downcast at the inauguration, and Kamala Harris mardy while checking her watch.View image in fullscreenMelania conducts a meeting.Photograph: AmazonMelania will not revolutionise cinemaAnticipation was high that the sum ($28m) paid by Melania to herself for not just starring in the film but producing it and overseeing much of the post-production, including the trailer and marketing, might result in something fresh for an art-form struggling to surface new voices. Sadly, such hopes will be dashed. Melania turns one of the most politically significant moments in recent history into an exhaustingly boring and chillingly vain autohagiography. Towards the end, Melania says of inauguration day: “Today was so rich with meaning, and since each moment was historic and filled with purpose, time no longer mattered.” It feels like a disclaimer for a film that demonstrates nothing of the former and feels like it lasts for ever.Being an enigma suited MelaniaEven unkind speculation can be more flattering than airbrushed honesty.

Worn in his left ear lobe, the barely there hoop has people fixated online.“Begging my boyfriend to get a tiny hoop earring too,” reads one post dedicated to the accessory. “I cried for over half ofHamnet, but Paul Mescal’s slutty little earring made me feel conflicted,” reads another.Mescal previously sent viewers of Normal People into a frenzy overConnell’s chain, a thin silver “Argos chic” necklace, and shortly after thrustshort shortsinto the mainstream. Now the Mescal effect seems to be coming for lobes.The search platform Lyst reports a 7% increase in demand for men’s earrings quarter on quarter. Meanwhile, a spokesperson for the jewellery brand and piercing studioAstrid & Miyusays over half of male purchases are now for piercing services with key placements including the lower lobe and tragus – a piece of cartilage that covers the ear canal. Huggies (hoops that sit tightly around the lobe) and singular hoop earrings have become its highest revenue-driving categories for men.While some Hamnet viewers are confused as to why a bard living in 1596 is wearing what appears to be a modern piece of jewellery, the decision to include it by the film’s costume designer, Malgosia Turzanska, and the director, Zhao, was deliberate. Speaking to the Guardian, Turzanska said many people “assume it is an anachronistic detail, or something that was simply overlooked, but of course it was a carefully chosen detail”.View image in fullscreenPeriod detail: the Chandos portrait of William Shakespeare shows off his hoop earring quite nicely.Photograph: IanDagnall Computing/AlamyZack Pinsent, a historical tailor and consultant, said that during the Elizabethan period earrings were widespread. “You couldn’t move for men wearing earrings. It was a sign of wealth and status. A labourer for example couldn’t afford to wear a gold earring.”Turzanska, whose work on the film landed her an Academy Award nomination, took her inspiration from Sir Walter Raleigh’s 1588 portrait where the adventurer wears a pearl earring, andthe Chandos portrait. The oil painting, created some time between 1600 and 1610 and housed in London’s National Portrait Gallery, is thought to be the only known Shakespeare portrait made from life. Attributed to the artist John Taylor, Shakespeare is depicted wearing a white-collared top with a glistening hoop in his left ear.Turzanska said she “wanted to capture the energy of that likeness, but without overpowering the character played by Paul [Mescal]. His Will [Shakespeare] is so distant from anything over the top, so we wanted to go for a subtle nod to the era.”Before Hamnet, Mescal regularly wore a gold hoop in his right ear including to his first audition with Zhao. The film-maker has described having “a casting process” for the earring where the choice of metal, colour and size was discussed. The final decision resulted in Mescal piercing his left lobe and covering the right one with makeup.“We opted for a small white gold hoop that does not draw attention to itself,” Turzanska said. “I think it goes well with the way Paul wears Will’s costume – the clothes move, the sleeves are rolled up, the neckline often open – it feels very modern and alive.”Mescal is not the only catalyst for the trend. James Norton’s singular silver hoop in the TV show House of Guinness has been called“the sexiest thing on TV”while Diego Calva and his gold earring in season two of The Night Manager is getting attention on a par with Tom Hiddleston’sbare bottomfrom season one.View image in fullscreenDiego Calva’s jewellery in the latest series of The Night Manager has also proved a hit with viewers.Photograph: BBC/Ink Factory/Des WillieThe hoop hype is happening off-screen too. Jacob Elordi, whostars as Heathcliff in the latest adaptation of Wuthering Heights, likes to wear tiny hoops in both lobes while Josh O’Connor prefers a singular silver hoop in his left ear.Throughout history, earrings for men have fallen in and out of favour. Pinsent says they were popular with men around the time of the French Revolution and among Georgian macaronis. During the Victorian period, clip-ons were preferred owing to the heaviness of pearl and jewel styles.Similar to drinking matcha and reading The Bell Jar in public, some critics link the singular hoop fixation with aperformative maleculture. However, Pinsent says it is more of “a modern phenomenon of men not wearing all the bling. People are now so ingrained with what their own idea of masculinity is. Let’s remember at one point in time wearing pink was the most manly thing you could do.”Explore more on these topicsPaul MescalMen's jewelleryChloé ZhaoHamnetMen's fashionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It was a seriously exciting debut. The year after, Treviño pulled off a similar coup in Zurich, establishing a career that has since caught fire across Europe. It has taken nearly a decade, but Treviño – this week announced as thenew principal conductorof Bucharest’s George Enescu Philharmonic – is finally back with the LSO. It was worth the wait.Treviño isn’t a flamboyant figure on the podium; his beat is tidy, his gestures deceptively contained. But there’s a coiled-spring muscularity and authority to his delivery that translated across the repertoire in this bizarrely programmed sequence. Rachmaninoff’s Symphony No 2 was the crowd-pulling second half, but before that a magnificent 20th-century oddity and something even odder from the 21st.Lost during the second world war, Messiaen’s 1932 Hymne was later “reconstructed” from memory by the composer. How accurately? No one knows. A Eucharist-ritual in sound, it’s a mystical, immanent affair, but Treviño ensured we never lost sight of the structural cathedral pillars through the clouds of incense billowing from the LSO strings and the woodwind’s distant organ.Márton Illés’s 2019 Vont-tér is less a violin concerto than its antithesis. Composed for maverick soloistPatricia Kopatchinskaja– appearing here in the second of three Artist Portrait performances – it strips the form of virtuosity and lyricism, turning expectations inside-out in its single continuous movement. Kopatchinskaja sold it hard, fiercely precise and playful, leading a chamber-sized LSO in a haunted textural dance of shudders, creaks and cracks (I missed the cameo for polystyrene plates). But what did it have to say to Messiaen or Rachmaninoff, beyond raising two musical fingers?Tempering the monumentality of the second symphony with plenty of pace and vertical translucency, Treviño gave us cinematic Rachmaninoff: melodies always on the move, always glancing forwards or harking back in this integrated web of a work. It’s a piece that can get top-heavy, but here we set off with the eruptive finale already in our sights, galloping to a close, brass with Valhalla in their sights.Explore more on these topicsClassical musicreviewsShareReuse this content"

Since starting Powerplant as a bedroom recording project in 2017, a couple of years after he left Ukraine to study in London, he has released records built around fizzing electro-punk,dungeon synthand treble-heavy hardcore, concocting Dungeons & Dragons-inspired role-playing adventures to accompany some of them, while slinging visually arresting DIY merch through hisArcane Dynamicslabel. Yet even coming amid an output this freewheeling, his upcoming new record is full of surprises.Bridge of Sacrifice is a pivot into black metal, with Zhykharyev’s antic synth melodies and slashing garage-rock guitars now accompanied by eerie screams and drum-machine blastbeats tinny enough to evoke the frost-bitten demos that emerged from Norway in the early 90s. It’s a head-spinning mix carried off with the gleeful energy of a fan indulging their passions – in thevideo for the title track, a trenchcoat-sporting Zhykharyev plays a Flying V in a creepy cellar, while Hall of Wolves’ squalling riff sounds comically evil – until the song breaks into a wonderfully camp, Cramps-worthy chorus.In these perma-anxious times, when hope is pretty much limited to placing one’s faith in the least-worst outcome, Zhykharyev’s desire to prioritise fun, earnestness and escapism in his fabulously odd music feels like sweet relief. He knows the stakes better than many –Beautiful Boy, a ripping punk song from 2023’s Grass EP, lamented everything that’s been lost since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

Campiche plucked guitar, zither and east Asian-style sounds from the harp, mingled with vocal loops, classical music, Nordic ambient jazz and more. You might call her soundscape magical or otherworldly if it didn’t coexist with a campaigner’s political urgency on environmental and social issues. But Campiche is too much of a visionary to overwhelm the eloquence of pure sound with polemic, as her new album, the unaccompanied Unspoken, confirms more than ever.View image in fullscreenThe artwork for Unspoken by Julie CampicheCampiche’s extra-musical agenda here is a celebration of sisterhood, dedicated to women in public and private lives who have inspired her. The opening Anonymous is built around a Virginia Woolf quote – “for most of history, ‘anonymous’ was a woman” – repeated by a chorus of women’s voices in different languages building to a clamour. Grisélidis Réal is named after the Swiss artist and writer who took her physical and mental life to every precipice, including sex work, expressed in gently lyrical harp lines around the spooky sounds of footsteps clicking on pavements.Rosa is a lilting harp melody dedicated to the weary resolve of migrant workers, the rhythm-shifting Andréa Bescond a lissome tribute to the French actor and director and on Maman du Ciel, Campiche mesmerisingly uses her in- and out-breaths as the rhythm pattern. Unspoken is the least jazzy of the remarkable Campiche’s ventures so far, but if she didn’t inhabit a world of improvisers, she could never have imagined it like this.Also out this monthNew York avant-jazz pianistCraig Tabornsurfaced in the late 90s with leaders including Tim Berne and Steve Coleman, but his own work has blossomed in the 21st century. With Dream Archives (ECM), in a trio with cello star Tomeka Reid and percussionist/composer Ches Smith, he embraces fast-moving collective free-swing, smouldering lyrical originals and two heartfelt tributes (Paul Motian’s Mumbo Jumbo and Geri Allen’s When Kabuya Dances). The trumpeterAirelle Besson, a luminary of French jazz, further nurtures her long relationship with accordionistLionelSuárezon Blossom (Bretelles Prod/Papillon Jaune), a mainstream but delightful mix of jaunty and tender originals, and affectionate covers of Carla Bley’s Ida Lupino and the Pat Metheny/Lyle Mays song Au Lait. And gifted young UK pianist/composerNoah Stonemancontinues his steady rise with Dance at Zero, ingenious transformations of his minuscule compositions into rich improvisations in the company of fast-rising young saxophonist Emma Rawicz, bassist Freddie Jensen and UK jazz drum maestro James Maddren.Explore more on these topicsJazzJazz album of the monthalbum reviewsShareReuse this content"

The Time Traveler’s Wife has sold more than 9m copies globally since its publication, and was adapted into a 2009 film starring Rachel McAdams, as well as an HBO series anda musical.The new book – due to be published on 27 October by Jonathan Cape, an imprint of Penguin, in the UK – is about the life of Alba DeTamble, the daughter of Henry and Clare, who are the characters at the centre of the original novel.Niffenegger wrote The Time Traveler’s Wife between 1997 and 2002, and “had no intention of writing any kind of sequel”. It was only years later that she had an idea for a follow-up story about Alba, which she began in November 2012.In the Time Traveler’s Wife, we learn that Henry has “Chrono-Displacement Disorder”, meaning he involuntarily travels through time, always arriving naked at his destination. Alba inherits the condition. In the original book, Henry dies when Alba is five.The sequel is partly about love – the “seed” of the book is Alba having two husbands, Zach and Oliver – in two different time periods, with an overlap – says Niffenegger.When Niffenegger began writing the sequel, Obama had just been re-elected; it was “a different world”. As she continued writing, “the world around me was changing quite a lot, and the book started getting more and more political”.Alba was born six days before 9/11, so Niffenegger realised that if she wanted to write about her protagonist as an adult, she would need to “take some guesses” about what the future might be like. “I thought, OK, that’s probably got a lot to do with climate change. So I started writing in that direction, and of course it rapidly turned into a dystopia, and then I thought, well, let’s bring some politics to bear on this situation. But I would put something in the book, and then it would happen in real life, and that got to be distressing. And then 2016 came and just blew everything up. Alba’s dystopia and my dystopia started looking similar.”Alba is a violinist and composer, so “something that keeps popping its head up here and there is, well, if the world’s going to shit, why make art? But my own feeling about that is that we make things for ourselves, and we make them for other people, and we make them to connect, and to document our thinking, and sometimes change our own minds. So, even if you knew the world was imploding tomorrow, you should still get out there and make things and do things.” Niffenegger is hoping the book “encourages people to be more ‘out there’, more active, in art, in politics, in their lives”.In Life Out of Order, Alba “is haunted by secrets she must keep from those she loves most, including Zach, her supportive anchor in the chaos, and Oliver, a fellow time traveller and musician,” reads the publisher’s description of the book. “Her journey takes her from the riots of Chicago’s streets to the eerie refuge of the Yellow House, to the digital corridors of the Museum of Lost Souls, a virtual sanctuary of forgotten memories and lost artefacts.”Niffenegger “had always thought a female time traveller would have a rough time running around in her nakedity and just getting harassed all the time”, she explains. “And then I thought, what if she had a place that was secluded, that was her own?” – much like the meadow in the original book, which is a meeting place for Henry and Clare. In the sequel, Alba is drawn to the Yellow House when she time travels – a Victorian-era property she has owned since before she was born, located in the Ravenswood neighbourhood of Chicago.The author described writing Life Out of Order as “all-consuming”, but said she will miss “living in it”.The Time Traveler’s Wife “was one of the most significant literary publications in history,” said Hannah Westland, publisher at Jonathan Cape. Life Out of Order is “uncannily of this moment” and a “profoundly moving celebration of love”. Vintage, the imprint of Penguin that oversees Jonathan Cape, will also publish new paperback and hardback editions of the original book this year.Explore more on these topicsThe Time Traveler's WifeAudrey NiffeneggernewsShareReuse this content"

Join the conversation in the commentsGeorge Saunders, Erin Somers and Guardian readersFri 30 Jan 2026 06.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 30 Jan 2026 06.02 ESTShareGeorge Saunders, authorLately I’ve been going back to read some classic works that I had, in my zany life-arc, missed, in the (selfish) hope of opening up new frequencies in my work. So:Alice’s Adventures in WonderlandandThrough the Looking GlassbyLewis Carroll(the zaniness seems to lack agenda and yet still says something big and political); then on toSpeak, Memoryby Nabokov, newly reminded that language alone (dense, beautiful) can power the reader along; and, coming soon,The Power Brokerby Robert A Caro – a real ambition-inspirer, I’m imagining, in its scale and daring.Vigil by George Saunders is published by Bloomsbury.To support the Guardian, order your copy atguardianbookshop.com. Delivery charges may apply.Matt, Guardian readerJonathan Franzen’sThe Correctionsis the rare novel that manages to be both a state-of-the-nation epic and an exquisitely painful family row. This particular family is so meticulously observed that reading about them feels less like fiction and more like overhearing neighbours arguing through a thin wall. Franzen’s great trick is to make misery funny without ever quite letting it off the hook. Nobody escapes unexamined, least of all the reader: I started off feeling superior but ended up recognising uncomfortable and unflattering fragments of myself scattered throughout the book. The Corrections is not cosy, and it’s not kind, but it is deeply humane. It suggests that love persists not because people are redeemable, but because they’re not. A brilliant, bracing novel that corrects nothing, yet understands everything.Ti, Guardian readerI’ve been reading JL Carr’sA Month in the Country. At a time when the world is ready to greet you with news of yet another horror every morning and people yearn for an analogue respite from doomscrolling or distracting ourselves with our phones, this short tale of a man restoring a medieval painting in a rural town in England is the balm we need. It’s witty, thoughtful, contemplative at times, and made me look up words such as “chancel”, “catafalque”, and “corbel”, immersing myself in the narrator’s craft and a summer in Yorkshire.View image in fullscreen‘Edith Wharton mania in our house’ … the American author in 1905.Photograph: The Granger Collection/AlamyErin Somers, authorLately, the great thrill of my life is to read classic books alongside my 10-year-old daughter, who is a big reader. Recently, we readEthan Frome, which is my husband’s favourite book. This unleashed a sort of Edith Wharton mania in my household. There is a proposition in the works to make Ethan Frome baseball caps. I recommend a reread, for those who haven’t engaged since high school, and I also recommend picking upThe New York Stories of Edith Wharton. Start with the last one: Roman Fever. For something more contemporary, I recommend reading Gwendoline Riley’s work in advance of the publication of her new book, The Palm House, in April. BothFirst LoveandMy Phantomsare masterpieces of dark comedy.The Ten Year Affair by Erin Somers is published by Canongate (£18.99). To support the Guardian, order your copy atguardianbookshop.com. Delivery charges may apply.Elle, Guardian readerView image in fullscreen‘I’ve never been so hungry and also so conscious of my own body’ … Butter author Asako Yuzuki.Photograph: Junya InagakiI wanted to read more this year, and am already on book number five of 2026. A successful resolution! I picked upValley of the Dollsby Jacqueline Susann as an impulse purchase, having heard of the film. The book felt glamorous and grotesque. It reminded me of the earliest part of The Bell Jar – when she’s in New York, feeling like an outsider looking in, desperately searching for happiness. The three women at its centre felt real, fatally flawed, impressionable, strong and – at times – hopeful. And I’m only partway throughButterby Asako Yuzuki, translated by Polly Barton, but loving it. I’ve never been so hungry and also so conscious of my own body while reading. In the same way that Rika describes feeling Kajii’s presence near her, I felt it last night while cooking. And so I used an extra pat of butter.Finn, Guardian readerMrs Calibanby Rachel Ingalls is a quick read at around 120 pages. It follows a lonely housewife, Dorothy, in 60s/70s/80s west coast America and her day-to-day existence. Dorothy knows her husband Fred is having an affair but the pair are “too unhappy to divorce”. She has also dealt with the death of her son, a miscarriage and the death of a dog in her past. She hears on the radio of a 6ft 7in “amphibious” frog-man escaping from a research lab - this creature enters her dining room and the two begin a passionate love affair which she keeps secret from her husband and the frog’s (named “Larry”) captors who are pursuing him. Mrs Caliban was funny in its absurdity, uniqueness, surrealism and originality, and also extremely sad when you learn of Dorothy’s past trauma and Larry’s torture in the lab. The novel also explores a number of key feminist themes, including the subversion of domesticity and critiques of marriage.Federico, Guardian readerI am currently readingThe Dream Hotelby Laila Lalami – a very current dystopia of state surveillance and invasive technology. The portrayal of how anyone can be perceived as a threat by totalitarian states is bloodcurdling. I will use this novel with my ESL students, as I am sure it will create fascinating debates.Explore more on these topicsBooksWhat we're readingGeorge SaundersLewis CarrollVladimir NabokovEdith WhartonGwendoline RileyJonathan FranzenfeaturesShareReuse this content"

This novel takes us around the camp, from Alyoshka’s family to Petko and his friend Vanu discussing old age to a new arrival who shares his tragic story of alcohol addiction: “The devil had entered my soul, and it was fun to be with him.” Meanwhile, Soviet representatives, intended to support the Nenets people, come and go: “They didn’t stick, because strictly speaking there was nothing to stick to.” This story of a solid community where people stick instead with one another is a perfect warming tale for winter.View image in fullscreenThe Old Fireby Elisa Shua Dusapin, translated by Aneesa Abbas Higgins (Daunt, £14.99)Agathe, a 30-year-old French woman living in New York, is so estranged from her sister Véra that when she receives a text message saying “Papa’s dead”, she replies: “Who is this?” Now she returns to the family home in the Dordogne to help clear out his things. “If we set fire to the books, there’d be nothing left.” Relations remain difficult: Véra communicates only by text message; she hasn’t spoken since the age of six. This is a book of absence and silence – village shops are closed, streets deserted, Agathe’s husband in the US doesn’t reply to her – and written with apt spareness. “I’m following the advice of decluttering influencers,” Agathe tells us, but it’s her past that she needs to offload, and slowly we learn the history of the family breakup. The balance between revelation and continued mystery makes this book both tantalising and satisfying.View image in fullscreenThe Roof Beneath Their Feetby Geetanjali Shree, translated by Rahul Soni (And Other Stories, £14.99)In an Indian neighbourhood, people use their connected roofs as an alternative living, sleeping and hiding place: “not a roof but a sea”. One is narrator Bitva, a man mourning the death of Chachcho, who was a mother figure to him. He resents Chachcho’s friend Lalna hanging around, interrupting his mourning. “You are driving Chachcho away by staying here.” We learn the characters’ stories: the rich uncle from Hong Kong; how Chachcho’s husband treated her; sexist rumours about Lalna’s promiscuity. “Advice flew around: take care of your sons!” Then a sudden switch, and we get Lalna’s own story, which changes things. The fluid structure can make it hard to follow – “my memories,” says Lalna, “always start somewhere in the middle” – but this novel, although on a much smaller scale than Shree’s International Booker winnerTomb of Sand, is just as full of exuberance and inventiveness.View image in fullscreenBerlin Shuffleby Ulrich Alexander Boschwitz, translated by Philip Boehm (Pushkin, £18.99)Boschwitz, whose novelThe Passengerwas a rediscovered hit recently, wrote two books before his death in 1942 at the age of 27. Berlin Shuffle was his debut: a cynical, funny account of down-and-out Berlin in the 1920s, where men and women are “caught under the wheels of life”. There’s greengrocer Schreiber, who lets out his basement to a trio of “tramps”, including Tönnchen, whose childhood hunger has made him food-obsessed; Grissmann, who lost his job to mechanisation (“machines made all problems seem splendidly solvable”); and petty criminal turned pimp Wilhelm. “At first he found the idea of living off prostitutes disgusting. But with time and money, he came round to the idea.” Despite the characters’ grim circumstances, this is a lively book, light on its feet if rougher round the edges than The Passenger, and with a fittingly explosive conclusion.Explore more on these topicsFictionTranslated fiction roundupreviewsShareReuse this content"

The book was either Charlie and the Chocolate Factory or its sequel, Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator, both byRoald Dahl.My favourite book growing upI loved Stuart Little, and all his small, clever things – his tiny canoe, his tiny sailboat. He had such a relaxed demeanor and was so dapper! I also loved Mary Norton’s The Borrowers series – tiny people living under the floorboards and improvising household goods out of “borrowed” safety pins and match boxes and so on. Clearly I had a thing for miniatures.The book that changed me as a teenagerDonald Barthelme’s Sixty Stories, because he was having such a good time and seemed so so smart, but was also mischievous and irreverent. It may sound corny but these stories made me grasp the existence of a world of art and literature. And Barthelme lived in Houston, where I was growing up, yet he was a major world writer.The writer who changed my mindIn the early 90s, while I was in graduate school, I readSigrid Nunez’sshort story Chang, which later became a portion of her first book, A Feather on the Breath of God. “Chang” had a seismic effect on me. Up to that point, I can’t recall having ever seen a multiracial character in fiction. I was so accustomed to the default whiteness of fictional characters that I didn’t even notice the absence of characters from other backgrounds. And even as I was trying at that time to write short stories about my father’s life in Korea, I would give those characters white-sounding, European-sounding names, as if I was hoping to disguise their specificity. It really pains me now to look back on this tendency in my writing, which proceeded directly from the sorts of writers I was taking as models, like Virginia Woolf and Henry James. When I read Sigrid’s story I was astonished that the narrator was the daughter of a white European woman and a brown Asian man – just like me! I hadn’t realised this sort of character was possible. It’s sort of heartbreaking that my thinking was so constricted, but the disruption to that thinking was thrilling.The book that made me want to be a writerI wanted to be a writer from such an early age it’s impossible to choose a single book to hold responsible, but the book that made me want to be a certain kind of writer wasTo the Lighthouse. I so desperately wanted to write the way Virginia Woolf does in that book that it made my writing insufferable for a very long time.The book I rereadThe Great Gatsby by F Scott Fitzgerald, which I despised at school, but now I’ve come to love the way I love certain comfort foods. It’s not the most nutritious and in some ways it’s repulsive, but the deep familiarity of it always hit the spot.Theauthor I came back toCharles Dickens. For so long I associated him with unbearable Christmas television specials, so I didn’t actually sit down and try reading him until shockingly late, and then I was enthralled. I read Bleak House for the first time during the pandemic – it was one of the great reading experiences of my life.The book I could never read againAnything by Tom Robbins. Another Roadside Attraction, Even Cowgirls Get the Blues, Jitterbug Perfume: they seemed great in my teens but now even just the titles make me cringe.The book I discovered later in lifeHomer’s Odyssey. Obviously I’d heard of it and must have read it for the first time in college, but it wasn’t until recently that I became completely fascinated by it and started wanting to reread it in different translations.The book I am currently readingI recently finishedJA Baker’s The Peregrine, which is one of the most extraordinary books I have ever read. It’s quite short, but the writing is so uncategorisable,immersive and transformative that I felt as if I’d been sucked into a different time-medium.Flashlight by Susan Choi will be published in paperback by Vintage next month (£10.99).

The tennis has nothing to keep me entertained for longer than 10 minutes, and I have been terrified of any golf game where you swing a controller since Christmas morning 2009, when my wife surprised me with Tiger Woods PGA Tour Golf for the Wii and I surprisedherby throwing my back out after a six-hour session on it.View image in fullscreenDominik Diamond (right) and his family play Wii Bowling in 2006 with great intensity.Photograph: Dominik DiamondVolleyball and badminton are a double serving of meh. Little kids might find them fun, but not this big one. Basketball has been carried over from Wii Sports Resort, and Chambara is an updated version of fencing. The latter is every bit as chaotic as the original, the former is still a car crash: the hand motion that you have to use to move and dribble is one that I haven’t vigorously practised since I was a teenager. And I don’t want to do it in front of my mother.If basketball is a fender-bender, then the new football game is a multi-car pileup. It’s a slower, less entertaining version ofRocket League, but one that allows you to strap a controller to your leg to virtually kick the ball. There is no way a 56-year-old man should try to kick something that doesn’t exist. You may as well take a pair of scissors to your hamstrings.However, just like Wii Sports before it, Switch Sports is worth every penny because of the bowling.It is the very essence of gaming fun and simplicity, which is great because we were all drunk when we had our first session. Three generations of Diamond family silliness. It was beautiful.Mum wasn’t without criticisms of the new version. The updated Mii characters are too realistic; she preferred the quasi-abstract shape of the Wii originals. And she is deflated that the Switch just says “spare” rather than “NICE SPARE!”Her biggest criticism is the size of the Joy-Con controllers compared with the Wii remote.“I am happier with something bigger in my hands,” she cackles.She is incorrigible. I know where I get it from.The next day it was just my mum and I, playing sober. It was a very different kind of gaming, social and laid-back; we talked about how she fell in love with this game during a Christmas at my house back in 2006. My brother was there, with his kids, and my sister-in-law was visiting from Canada. I have zero recollection of this, so thank goodness I have an elderly mother to help me remember things in my dotage.‘I wouldn’t have the life I have had without her’ … Dominik Diamond plays on his mum’s ZX Spectrum.Photograph: Dominik DiamondShe loved it so much that when she returned home, she immediately bought her own Wii. It lives and breathes to this day, with all the plastic adornments you got with Wii Sports – the one and only game she has ever played on it.Introducing her to her favourite game feels like a repayment, because my mum was the one who got me into gaming. She had gone back to school to train as a word processing teacher in the 80s and had an interest in programming, so she bought a ZX Spectrum to learn BASIC – but she never had a chance, as us kids hijacked the machine to go Manic Mining. Yup. Our Atic Atac addiction stopped our mum from essentially becoming Brenda Romero.Mum claims she introduced me to the “game” that changed my life. Mavis Beacon Teaches Typing. She has a point. I type crazy fast, because of Mavis. We reminisce about the last-minute calls to her theatre school when we were short of audience members for GamesMaster, and the joy she felt when I got athletes to wave hello to her on the telly.I wouldn’t have the life I have had without her.I hope that my kids get me over for a games night when I am 76, so they can finally best me at Street Fighter II, when my arthritic thumbs can no longer pull off a Dragon Punch. And then I hope that their kids do that with them, and this glorious circle of gaming life continues.I am so happy to have this time with her to play games again. But I’m even happier for the space we fillaroundthe game, the memories we continue to create. A week after she left, I booted up bowling again, but I only played for 10 minutes before I switched it off. It just wasn’t the same without Mum.Explore more on these topicsGamesNintendo SwitchFamilycommentShareReuse this content"

Conductor Mark Wigglesworth keeps up the momentumFlora WillsonFri 30 Jan 2026 10.30 ESTLast modified on Fri 30 Jan 2026 13.05 ESTShareA figure with the head of a doll plays with a multicoloured spinning top, high above the stage. Three men – hooded and armed – creep forwards and seize him, slashing his throat and dragging him off.It’s a brutal start to a brutal opera. This flashback is the brainchild of directorRichard Jones(in his2016 Royal Opera production, revived for the second time by Ben Mills, we see it replayed twice more as an episode that haunts the protagonist), but the overriding atmosphere is Mussorgsky’s. Based on Pushkin’s drama about a tsar’s reign, Boris Godunov is among the darkest of all operas. In the composer’s lean, mean original version, it is almost relentlessly so: dominated by low voices, its orchestration dense and heavy, the seven scenes push inexorably towards crisis.In this context, pacing is everything. ConductorMark Wigglesworthkept up the momentum, maximising the contrast between the score’s muddiest, most overblown passages, where monumental slabs of lower brass were almost obliterated by the tolling of bells, and the light cast periodically by finely blended high woodwind. When not inaudible – did those tintinnabulations need to be quite so catastrophic? – the strings were vital to this musical chiaroscuro, by turns fidgety and tender, roughly hewn and spun into a single, delicate thread.View image in fullscreenAmong the darkest of all operas… Boris Godunov at the Royal Opera House.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianIn Jones’s production, the drama plays out in a single, beautifully lit set: a cavernous charcoal-grey box with a small, bright yellow, low-ceilinged chamber above. The chorus is clad in regulation peasant-drab until ordered to dress brightly for Boris’s coronation. The Boyars sport matching jaw-length 1970s bobs and everyone onstage is slightly grubby – except the hostess (a cameo played here bySusan Bickleyin a stroke of deluxe casting) who is a one-woman colour pop. There’s an opening burst of movement as the chorus dashes around frantically and the painful physical progress ofAdam Palka’s elderly monk Pimen, whose “chronicle” becomes a vast panel of paintings he drags across the stage to stress the nature of his burden. The light-relief “monks” in the tavern scene bob around cartoonishly.Mostly, however, this is a production that frames the singing as the main event. Among an impressive cast, Palka andAndrii Kymach(as the Boyar’s clerk Andrei Shchelkalov) stood out as especially compelling, while Robert Berry-Roe was exceptionally assured in the treble role of Boris’s son. In promising house debuts,Alexander Roslavetswas an ideally thuggish Varlaam andJamez McCorklesumptuously treacle-voiced as Grigory Otrepiev. Best of all wasBryn Terfelin the title role he has taken in this production since its debut. His tsar is unmistakeably troubled: wild-eyed, with violent consonants, grim giggles and lurches into barking. But Terfel’s voice also remains supple and rich, its beauty insisting on this complex character’s ultimate humanity.Until 18 February.Explore more on these topicsOperaClassical musicreviewsShareReuse this content"

It is all about artifice, after all, and interrogates the construction of art as illusion through Prospero’s rough magic. So its pairing with experimental writer-actor-director Tim Crouch seems like a natural one. Or rather non-naturalist because this painfully high-concept production comprehensively underlines its artifice.It emphatically punctures the fourth wall until the drama becomes leaden with messages about theatre, and the act of watching is draining. Maybe this is the point? Actors often sit in a circle, barely moving, as if in rehearsal. At times they trip up in their lines, which are occasionally finished off by another or spoken in unison.Miniature models that symbolise characters who fetch in from the shipwreck are laid out in a row as their stories are narrated, to suggest that the act of storytelling, and make-believe, is a form of control and manipulation.Crouch plays Prospero and is a cross between a curmudgeonly farmer and festivalgoer with a hint of Worzel Gummidge. Miranda (Sophie Steer) is playful and stroppy by turns. Caliban (Faizal Abdullah) wears a Gascoigne football jersey and flip-flops, with nothing of the “monster” about him. Ariel (Naomi Wirthner) is decidedly unspritely, with a sombre, wise-owl watchfulness, in an embroidered dress denoting the indigenous culture of this island. It is clear that both characters have rejected Prospero’s definition of them and Caliban occasionally speaks in Singaporean Malay – to resist his definitions and dominion as a whole?View image in fullscreenFarmer-festivalgoer … Tim Crouch as Prospero.Photograph: Marc BrennerThe production also reduces Prospero’s lines, parcelling them out to other characters. It’s interesting as a concept but where does this post-colonial decentring fit in with Prospero as the all-controlling coloniser that the play, and this production, also asserts?Actors emerge from among the audience, some standing up from their seats, some pushing their way to the stage, and then returning to watch the play afterwards. It is invigorating when this first happens – funny, transgressive and original. It is the same when singers pop up in gangways and balconies, and makes literal Crouch’s preoccupation with active audience engagement (although the actors here are “acting” as the audience).Who is audience and who is actor, you wonder, and that is a thrilling idea but the trick is played again and again until it feels educational, like something is being taught to us in these fractures of theatrical convention. For a play that deals with artifice with such agility, the exposure of its artifice feels wooden here and over-emphatic.When it works it sparks, dangerously, as when Prospero stops mid-sentence and asks an audience member to put their phone away. Is this for real or part of the play? And Rachana Jadhav’s set is a thing of beauty, with a museum-like quality of contested “exotic” artefacts belonging to other lands, and a model boat spun around when Prospero conjures his storm.Toto Kerblammo! review – Tim Crouch offers up doggy delight and human heartacheRead moreThe production comes alive in the second half, the set and lighting creating magic even if the play attempts to abjure Prospero’s (and Shakespeare’s) studied alchemy. And there are so many interesting ideas at play. It is a shame that there is something medicinal about them: the idea that this is Good for us. The drama feels unsatisfactory when it is entirely sacrificed for the high concept, and possibly bamboozling for someone encountering it for the first time.Antonia (Prospero’s usurping sister, played by Amanda Hadingue) is a high-achieving conservative type who leaves in a huff, mid-scene. “I know this story and I don’t recognise it at all … I shall be writing to the Telegraph,” she says, in one of the funniest moments. It foils the naysayers, and is damning too, especially for this Guardian reader, who feels her own sense of frustration.AtSam Wanamaker Playhouse, London, until 12 AprilExplore more on these topicsTheatreShakespeare's GlobeTim CrouchThe TempestreviewsShareReuse this content"

Nevertheless he swings, he swoons, he balances with limbs entwined around the narrow bars, reaching up to an imagined starry sky (it’s actually the high ceiling of aRoyal Balletrehearsal studio in Covent Garden). This is the iconic opening of the ballet Pierrot Lunaire, where a childlike clown is wonderstruck by the sight of the moon.View image in fullscreenEccentric, challenging … Bob Powell (left) and Glen Tetley perform in Tetley’s ballet in 1962.Photograph: Jack Mitchell/Getty ImagesMade in 1962 by the US choreographer Glen Tetley – whose centenary is celebrated this year – Pierrot Lunaire is a distinctive, eccentric, challenging work, set to Arnold Schoenberg’s atonal song cycle of the same name. It’s based on poems by Albert Giraud, delivered insprechstimme, a vocal style halfway between song and speech that sounds sometimes like singsong nursery rhymes, elsewhere like a ghostly aural apparition. The ballet is not regularly performed – the last time the RoyalBalletdanced it was 20 years ago – but it has a special status in the ballet rep, as a pioneering example of blending modern dance with classical, and as a juicy role for its male lead as the sad clown Pierrot, the commedia dell’arte stock character here given an emotional journey of surprising depth. It was Rudolf Nureyev’s favourite ballet, apparently.This season Pierrot will be danced alternately by Royal Ballet principal Sambé, one of the company’s leading men, and soloist Joshua Junker. Sambé is much loved for his winningly sunny energy but here he’s tapping into his wide-eyed vulnerable side, as Pierrot’s hopeful naivety is punctured by encounters with Columbine, the object of his unrequited affection, and the antagonist Brighella, whom Tetley called “the dark clown of experience”.“For a while I found it really hard connecting with this piece,” says Sambé, seeing the stock character as two-dimensional, but working with Christopher Bruce, who was a famed interpreter of the role in the 1960s, unlocked it. “What makes it so poignant and emotional is that this archetype is full of human traces,” says Sambé. “It’s about bringing something of my DNA to it. It’s deeply layered, comedic but based in darkness, a place of huge contemplation, self-discovery and curiosity.”View image in fullscreen'It’s scary!’ … Marcelino Sambé, left, and Mathew Ball rehearsing Pierrot Lunaire.Photograph: Andrej UspenskiJunker sees the piece as a journey from innocence into adulthood and its harsh realisations: “There is pain, there’s suffering, there’s responsibility”. “It’s a really symbolic piece,” he says. “Brighella is his own character but also represents Pierrot’s internal relationship with himself, like the shadow in Jungian psychology.”Both dancers initially found the music a challenge. “In the beginning I was horrified by it!” says Sambé. He’d previously danced to Schoenberg’s earlier, more Romantic string sextet Verklärte Nacht, which he loved, “but this was probably his least accessible work for me.” The mercurial sounds of the small instrumental ensemble and the soprano’s swooping delivery makes for a mood that’s eerie, fantastical, funny and strange. Music is often a rhythmic driver for a dancer, “but with this score, music becomes a feeling,” says Sambé. “Almost like an organism in itself, with its own veins and blood.” He’s acclimatised to it. “Now I find myself in the kitchen, chopping onions, listening to Pierrot Lunaire.”View image in fullscreen‘Intimate’ … Joshua Junker in rehearsals.Photograph: Andrej UspenskiTetley himself was the first Pierrot. His early dance career in the 1940s and 50s was spent with classical companies (Joffrey Ballet, American Ballet Theatre) and at the vanguard of modern dance, working with Hanya Holm and Martha Graham. He brought all of those influences to his own choreography, mixing a more contemporary use of the body with classical steps – revolutionary at the time. He was instrumental in bringing that style to the UK as well, helping the company then called Ballet Rambert transition into a modern dance troupe.Pierrot Lunaire is 40 minutes long and, unusually, for these performances the ballet will be performed as a standalone piece, rather than as part of a double or triple bill. “It’s going to be a very intimate experience,” says Junker. “Just the three of us, close up on a small stage, so there can be a real focus on the dancers and the music.” (The music will be played live.) Sambé describes it as “putting a magnifying glass to [Tetley’s] vision”. Learning the ballet has been an education for Sambé, “to understand a bit more about this modernist moment in dance, the influence of Martha Graham and this new age of movement, the high level of craftsmanship.”He’s inspired by the fact that choreographers and composers of the era were deliberately challenging their audience. “It’s something that is confronting, not just ballet that is comforting,” he says. “We don’t experience work so much like this any more, at least in the dance that I see. It’s going to be uncomfortable and funny, poignant, sad and beautiful at the same time,” he predicts. “It leaves you with more questions. And I love work like that.”Pierrot Lunaire is atLinbury theatre, London, 10-20 FebruaryExplore more on these topicsDanceClownsRoyal BalletBalletfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It was the Ulster immigrants, passing down their boisterous tunes and melancholy ballads, who gifted the US some of its first iterations of country music.Composer Finn Anderson and director Tania Azevedo have used that journey to tell a musical story across generations. Our starting point is New York couple Sarah and Alix, moving into their new home and Marie Kondo-ing a mystery box sent to Sarah by a dying aunt. It turns out to contain audio tapes tracing song origins back up the family line, a reconnection to Sarah’s West Virginia roots that is first unwelcome and then increasingly transformative.No kidding: this music would move anyone. Anderson’s score powerfully evokes the source material it is exploring, and the ensemble’s singing positively electrifies the traditional songs – The Four Marys, Handsome Molly – that he incorporates and adapts with the fluidity that has accompanied them down the centuries.View image in fullscreenTransformative … the ensemble of Ballad Lines.Photograph: Pamela RaithIn a nearly all-female cast, Kirsty Findlay breaks the heart as Cait, a spirited but troubled Scottish minister’s wife living in the 1600s. Meanwhile Yna Tresvalles teases the wit from the script as 18th-century Londonderry teenager Jean (“If God didn’t want us tempted, he wouldn’t have invented sailors”). It’s their respective pregnancies that fuel the show’s themes of motherhood and choice – the act-one number, Unexpected Visitor, is a standout – and which rather outshine the contemporary story.With brilliant support from Sian Louise Dowdalls as Jean’s vociferous sister and Ally Kennard – who brings a vital empathy to all the male roles – it’s hard not to find yourself wishing these characters back on stage in some of the New York scenes. Aunt Betty emerges from her largely narrative role only late in the day, and the ending delivers its message with all the subtlety to be expected of a voice from the grave.Still, there’s no faulting any of the vocal performances in this full-throated, folk-energy production (not least in a stirring second-half flatfooting number). It’s a worthy tribute to the music it loves – here’s hoping the show can share it more widely.AtSouthwark Playhouse Borough, London, until 21 MarchExplore more on these topicsMusicalsTheatreSouthwark PlayhouseFolk musicCountryreviewsShareReuse this content"

As it happens, his shoulders ease, his eyes smile, he is totally relaxed. If it is true that we become the most distilled versions of ourselves when we are at our most comfortable, then it is clear here that the very essence of Dìrísù’s personhood is a Nigerian man.The opportunity to nurture his Nigerian identity was a significant factor in Dìrísù’s decision to take on his latest film, the Bafta-nominated My Father’s Shadow. The entire project – on which he serves both as lead actor and executive producer – was shot on location in Lagos, the country’s former capital city, over an eight-week period in early 2024. “I’d have said yes if the script was half as good,” Dìrísù says. “When I first got it I was excited to just be working in Nigeria: it was so important for me not only to work there, but also to be in the country independently as an adult. And to get to see my grandma more than once in a year! On top of this, not a lot of actors get to tell a story as tender, beautiful and considered as this one.”We meet late morning on the day after Boxing Day. Though we’re both south Londoners, Dìrísù has made a cryptic request to meet north of the river; the text message says he “needs” to be in Highbury in the early afternoon. It’s when he arrives wearing a vintage Arsenal shirt from their 1990-1992 era that it all makes sense. He hasn’t been able to use his season ticket recently because he has temporarily relocated to the US east coast to shoot All the Sinners Bleed, a forthcoming Netflix series from showrunner Joe Robert Cole. But now, he’s in London and Arsenal are playing at home, so that’s where he needs to be.Set during Nigeria’s 1993 election crisis, My Father’s Shadow is inspired by the relationship its creators – brothers Wale Davies and Akinola Davies Jr (the latter directs, but the piece is co-written) – have with their late father, who died from epilepsy when the two of them were babies. It follows a father, Fọlárìn, and his young sons as they spend a day in Lagos, while political unrest threatens the journey back home to their village. “On the surface level, the movie is about a father taking the opportunity to reconnect with his sons,” Dìrísù explains. “But it is [also] a fantastical, pseudo-biographical piece of work about grief and loss and family, fatherhood, masculinity, connection and absence.”Ultimately we are our parents’ children. There’s a lot of my father that lives in meAlthough the film is about the relationship Wale and Akinola have with their father, they were clear with Dìrísù very early in the process that he was not being asked to recreate a memory. Without their father as the reference point, he turned to his own. “It’s in the way he calls my name, or the way he stands, and some of his facial expressions and mannerisms,” Dìrísù says. “There was a real celebration of the relationship that I have with him in a way that maybe I hadn’t quite intended. That tenderness I learned from him.” And the disciplinarian? “Oh man, yeah – I have definitely been shouted at like that before!”, he says. “Ultimately we are our parents’ children. There’s a lot of him that lives in me so when I draw my own artistry and the disposition of my life, he’s there in the most positive ways. I’m just grateful I had him as a father.”Tenderness is a word that comes up a lot.Fatherhood regularly shows up as a theme across Dìrísù’s CV: it’s there in the 2018 Netflix horror His House, in which he stars opposite Wunmi Mosaku. They play a refugee couple from Sudan struggling to adjust to their new life in a small English town after the death of their young daughter. In Gangs of London – a Sky Atlantic series about power struggles in the city’s criminal underworld – the fact his character Elliot has a son is a notable plot point. He wouldn’t say it’s intentional, but he’s aware of it. “As someone who is very ambitious to become a parent at some point in my life, the questions about it are constantly present.”View image in fullscreenFather figure … Dìrísù with the Egbo brothers.Photograph: BFA/AlamyOf My Father’s Shadow he says he couldn’t have had the on-screen relationship he had with his co-stars (and real-life brothers) Chibuike Marvellous Egbo and Godwin Chiemerie Egbo without also developing that dynamic off screen; teaching them how to swim (“though I won’t take full credit for that, they still can’t!”), answering questions on acting technique and keeping them out of the crew’s – and harm’s – way during filming.Dìrísù had great insecurity about his own performance. Perhaps this comes from portraying a man so solidly rooted in his Nigerian identity, but being what he describes as a Nigerian of the diaspora, not of the country. His upbringing and familial home was unquestionably Nigerian, but he has never lived there. The distance that comes from that circumstance is something he is actively trying to close. A huge part of that is learning to speak Yoruba more fluently – he took about 30 hours of lessons to prepare for the role. “Put me in a Yoruba-only speaking area and I wouldn’t die, I wouldn’t starve, but I wouldn’t run for office, y’know?” he says. But it’s the most valuable gift of this experience: “If there’s one thing I would take from my career of learning skills so far, it wouldn’t be jiujitsu, or kung fu, or boxing – it would be the ability to communicate with my ancestors.”Our film is in Yoruba and pidgin and English, and is subtitled but it’s touching people in places like KoreaThere has been a lot made of the narrative that My Father’s Shadow was the first Nigerian film to be invited to screen at theCannes film festival. While it’s true it was the first to be selected for the festival’s Official Selection – it premiered in the Un Certain Regard section of the event, winning the Special Mention for the Camera D’Or prize – Dìrísù is at pains to clarify that other Nigerian films have been shown at the festival before My Father’s Shadow. “There is this wilful amnesia to the quality of Nigerian film,” he says. “I don’t want to take praise away from the wonderfully well-achieving films that come out of Nigeria that aren’t celebrated by the west. Maybe they weren’t considered for the Grand Prix or any of the other prizes that could be awarded [at Cannes], but they were there.”In any case Dìrísù is ambivalent about such accolades, which feel to him less like a legitimate reason to celebrate and more like an indictment on an industry that has often been all but impenetrable to Black talent seeking to tell stories about Black life. He’s also cognisant of allowing a western gaze to too much influence his understanding of success. “It reminds me of when director Bong Joon-ho won the best film Oscar for Parasite and said: ‘This is still basically just a local awards ceremony.’ That was so incredibly defiant of him to basically say if the west doesn’t say it’s good it doesn’t mean it’s not good, y’know?”Film stars, photographers and fans: the other side of Cannes – in picturesRead moreDìrísù has loved taking in the general audience response to the showings that have taken place across the world since its Cannes premiere. “I remember when I was at school and this really influential teacher said a play – and I extend this to any sort of performance – should be able to be experienced, enjoyed, by someone who’s deaf, someone who doesn’t speak the language, someone who’s blind. The quality of the storytelling should transcend traditional barriers to entry. That sentiment has come back with our film, which is in Yoruba and pidgin and English and is subtitled but it is touching people in places like Korea. That’s a really, really wonderful experience.”There are few films Dìrísù would say are more of a love letter to its people and places than this one. It’s an accurate summation. We meet strangers for the first time who feel warmly familiar, the honestly captured landscapes create a longing to return to places we’ve never visited: it’s both a representation and an invitation. In interviews, director Akinola has spoken a lot about the Lagos of the 80s and 90s he grew up in disappearing as time goes on. Dìrísù recalls him talking about wanting to capture and honour the mundanities of that life. “There’s a lot where nothing is happening but it’s so engaging and texturally accurate to that period and that place. If we don’t put a lens on these things, we don’t cherish them. They can be erased; they can be forgotten. Akinola wanted to crystallise the Nigeria of his childhood in memory by making this film. And I think he really has.”My Father’s Shadow isinUKcinemas from6 February, distributed by MUBI.Explore more on these topicsṢọpẹ́ DírìsúNigeriaCannes film festivalinterviewsShareReuse this content"

Yet this was the distinction the actor Jayasree Kabir, who has died aged 73, achieved while shifting between the southern and northern hemispheres as work and family commitments required.Launched while still a teenager in Ray’s 1970 film Pratidwandi (The Adversary), Kabir compiled a modest yet highly selective list of credits, including several key titles of Bangladeshi cinema, before making her final screen appearance in a 2004 episode of the BBC’s primetime ratings winner New Tricks, starring Bolam.The Adversary – adapted from aSunil Gangulynovel, and the first film in what became known as Ray’s Calcutta trilogy – found the revered Indian director pulling his cinema in a new direction and shape, seemingly under the influence of early Jean-Luc Godard and New Hollywood films. Emerging in the same year asBob Rafelson’s Five Easy Pieces, to which it suggested an eastern equivalent, the drama pounded the city’s neon-lit streets in the company of Dhritiman Chatterjee’s Siddhartha, a disillusioned college dropout on a punishing quest for gainful employment and satisfaction besides.View image in fullscreenKabir outside the Genesis cinema, east London, during the 2006 Bangladeshi film festival.Photograph:  Courtesy of Mostafa KamalThe 17-year-old Kabir, then billed as Jayasree Roy, was cast as Keya, the wide-eyed family friend who calls a passing Siddhartha into her family’s home to repair a blown fuse. Keya briefly lifts the protagonist’s head (“what is the point of seeing the darker side of everything?”) and offers him renewed reason to persist, even as he’s finally driven into exile. Her beguiling stillness contrasts with her swain’s restless agitation: as Kabir later told the writerBulbul Hasan, Ray “expected precision, but he also made you feel that the camera would capture exactly what you offered – nothing more, nothing less”.The film proved a success, winning three prizes at India’s National Film awards, including best director and screenplay for Ray. Yet Kabir admitted that this professional breakthrough owed a great deal to chance.Born in Calcutta, she was the daughter of Santi and Amalendu Das Gupta, an editor and journalist respectively, who also owned and ran the Nirupama printing and publishing works in the city. Towards the end of her studies at the city’s South Point school, Jayasree entered the Miss Calcutta beauty pageant on a whim – “the event was being held in [the restaurant] Firpo’s, where my father had taken me for dinner” – and promptly won, catching Ray’s eye during his search for new faces.“Winning Miss Calcutta opened doors,” Kabir said, “but it was only a beginning. Cinema demanded something different – something deeper. I was fortunate to meet remarkable people early on.”In the wake of The Adversary, she continued to work in Bengali-language cinema, appearing in Dinen Gupta’s Ajker Nayak (Today’s Hero, 1972) and opposite local star Samit Bhanja in Ajit Lahiri’s Ek Bindu Sukh (One Point Happiness, 1977). Yet her most important films of this period were made in conjunction with the Bangladeshi critic turned director Alamgir Kabir, whom she met through Ray and married in 1975.After collaborating on Surjo Konna (Daughter of the Sun, 1975), a romantic fantasy about an artist looking for love, the couple began work on the enduring Shimana Periye (Across the Fringe, 1977), a riff onLina Wertmüller’s 1974 Marxist melodrama Swept Away, in which Kabir’s privileged Tina washes up on a desert island opposite a lowly boatman in the wake of a cyclone. The film was a notable success, winning four awards at Bangladesh’s National Film awards; Kabir’s lip-sync performance of the keening love song Bimurto Ei Ratri Amar – written by Bhupen Hazarika and sung by Abida Sultana – passed into regional cinematic legend.View image in fullscreenKabir starred in the multi-award-winning 1977 film Shimana Periye (Across the Fringe)A further success followed with the urban corruption drama Rupali Shaikate (The Loner, 1979), yet the pair’s personal and professional bonds had begun to fray. Upon separating from her husband, Kabir left Dhaka to return to Calcutta, before uprooting to east London with their son, Shourov. In the UK, she initially supported herself by teaching English at a higher-education college and providing voiceover work for the BBC and Channel 4. It was while in England that she learned of her husband’s death, in a drowning accident in 1989.Adapting to British life proved a challenge, as she recalled in a 2003 interview: “I had cut myself off from acting and the media … I was finding it difficult to juggle a demanding career [while] bringing up my son as a single parent. Now, with my son settled in his career, I can consider projects which have long been buried in my mind.” She went on to take two further supporting roles on British TV: in the BBC’s white nationalism drama England Expects (2004) and in Painting on Loan, the second ever episode of New Tricks, in which she appeared huddled and scarred – and speaking Bengali – as the victim of a racist firebombing.Thereafter, Kabir shied away from the spotlight, although she maintained a regular presence at and eventually became a patron of theRainbow International film festival– held annually at the Genesis cinema in Mile End, east London – where she kept a watchful and nurturing eye on cinematic developments in her former homeland. As late as 2010 she noted: “It shouldn’t be difficult to improve the standard of Bangladeshi films with the aid of technology. Young film-makers need to take the initiative towards that end.”She is survived by Shourov.Jayasree Kabir, actor, born 22 June 1952; died 12 January 2026Explore more on these topicsFilmobituariesShareReuse this content"

Dozens of new shirts arrive from the factory almost every day, and almost every day they sell out,” said Matheus Camarotti, Pitombeira’s director of communications.View image in fullscreenA model poses at the carnival group’s headquarters in Olinda.Photograph: Pitombeira dos Quatro CantosGiven the frenzy it is generating among leftists across the country, some already believe the T-shirt will still be prominent in October, when the leftist president,Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, will seek re-election.Lula himself recentlyreceivedone of the T-shirts, which some see as a reaction to theappropriation of Brazil’s green-and-yellow national football shirt by far-right supporters of former president Jair Bolsonaro, who isbehind barsafter being convicted of attempting a coup.View image in fullscreenPresident Lula receiving a Pitombeira T-shirtPhotograph: Ricardo Stuckert/PRMany Bolsonaro supporters still defend the 1964–1985 military regime whose atrocities are depicted in the film, and The Secret Agent’s success has been embracedabove allby the Brazilian left.Since the film was released inBrazillast November, more than 10,000 T-shirts have been sold – compared with fewer than 3,000 in an entire year previously – both online and to dozens of people who now visit Pitombeira’s headquarters each day.A 489-year-old city of brightly coloured facades and colonial architecture, Olinda neighbours Recife, the capital of Pernambuco, in north-east Brazil, and together they are among the country’s most popular carnival destinations, receiving 3.5 million visitors in 2025.Unlike the world-famousparadesin Rio de Janeiro, Pernambuco’s carnival does not rely on samba but onfrevo, a rhythm also rooted in Afro-Brazilian influences but, unlike samba’s hallmark polyrhythms, shaped by the binary pulse of military marches, with a heavier use of brass instruments such as trumpets and trombones.Frevo choreography is also markedly different, characterised by jumps, crouches and the use of colourful umbrellas – the cast and crew of The Secret Agent evenperformedthe steps on the red carpet at the Cannes film festival, where Pernambuco native Kleber Mendonça Filho won best director.The film’s costume designer, Rita Azevedo, said the idea of dressing the protagonist in a Pitombeira shirt emerged during extensive research of photographic archives showing Pernambuco in the 1970s.In the movie, the T-shirt appears when Moura’s character, Marcelo, an academic hiding from the corrupt military dictatorship, takes refuge in a housing complex where a small community is also seeking shelter.“He arrives there in the middle of carnival, so I believe the shirt was a gift given to him as a welcoming gesture from the longer-standing residents,” said Azevedo.For Pitombeira, the “gift”, which they only discovered by watching the film, could not have come at a better moment.It costs about £12,600 to take the group’s 150 members to the two parades it stages during carnival, and Pitombeira has traditionally relied mainly on support from local government, which often arrives late, and to a lesser extent on souvenirs such as caps and T-shirts.With record T-shirt sales, the group has already covered the cost of this year’s parades and expects soon to set aside the funds for next year’s as well.Each shirt costs about £8 on the group’swebsite, and a brand has bought the rights to sell a fancier version for £21, but an increasing number of pirated versions are beingsoldin street markets. Pitombeira has urged people not to buy them because they provide no support for the group.Azevedo said she was pleased that the film’s success was helping the group. “We borrowed these visual and aesthetic records, and being able to give something back in this way, knowing that the sales will ensure Pitombeira can put on its carnival, is priceless,” she said.Explore more on these topicsBrazilCannes film festivalLuiz Inácio Lula da SilvaAmericasfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Last is صباح عمر سعد المصري, or Sabah Omar Saad al-Masri, an eight-year-old girl.These names of two children mark the beginning and end of the Wall of Tears, a massive art installation paying homage to the 18,457 children killed inGazabetween 7 October 2023 and 19 July 2025. Created by artistPhil Buehler, it opened next to Pine Box Rock Shop bar at 12 Grattan Street in Brooklyn, New York, on Thursday.Made of waterproof and UV-coated vinyl, the 50ft long, 10ft tall sand-coloured mural lists the children killed in Gaza by the order in which they died, based on data from the Gaza health ministry. This will be punctuated by photos and stories of individual children, drawing on reports bythe Guardianand Washington Post newspapers.‘It felt like she was asking me to save her’: the film based on a five-year-old Palestinian girl’s dying pleasRead more“If you approach from a distance, it looks like almost an abstract painting and that draws people in to see, what is that?” Buehler, 69, says by phone. “Then you’ll see they’re names of the children killed inGazasince 7 October and there are thousands of them stretching down the block.“Then you’ll be drawn in further, I hope, to see the faces, read the stories of some of the few dozen I’ve scattered throughout the fence. That’s the part that gets me when I look at it. You see these faces full of joy and hope, snapshots from graduations and birthday parties and family gatherings and knowing that these kids’ lives were just cut short.”The artist reflects: “You can’t not think about your own kids and your own families. I hope that might lead people to think about how they might help, even if it’s just, take a photo of the mural and pass it along on their social media to their friends and family because hearing something from someone you know is important.”Buehler has previously designed huge murals including Wall of Lies, displaying more than 20,000 lies told by Donald Trump during his first term as president; theWall of Liars and Deniers, listing 381 Republican election deniers running in the 2022 midterms; theWall of Shame, chronicling the actions of more than 1,500 January 6 rioters; andEmpty Beds, highlighting the abduction of nearly 20,000 Ukrainian children by Russia.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Phil BuehlerHe worked on the Wall of Tears with his regular collaborator, the non-profitRadio Free Brooklyn. The project is necessarily out of date before it opens: it only records deaths up until last July because that was the most recent update to the Gaza health authorities’ database; hundreds more children have been killed since then, even after an October ceasefire.“This is probably one of the hardest ones I’ve worked on emotionally,” Buehler says. “I always think of this quote attributed to Stalin, that a single death is a tragedy, a million deaths is a statistic. People can relate to one person’s suffering but then they tune out or get overwhelmed by thousands and the destruction and death in Gaza is one of those stories.“I hope with this piece, the Wall of Tears, you can both understand the scale of these 18,457 children’s deaths by seeing their names stretching down the street 50 ft and empathise with their surviving families.”Despite harsh weather, Buehler opened the installation on Thursday to coincide with the second anniversary of the death of Hind Rajab, a five-year-old left to bleed out among the bodies of six family members after their car was targeted by an Israeli tank, leaving it with 335 bullet holes, according to theForensic Architecture research group.The Palestine Red Crescent Society released audio recordings of Hind’s final hours, documenting repeated, urgent requests for rescue and call handlers, increasingly distressed themselves, assuring her that help was on the way. This real-life audio can be heard in theThe Voice of Hind Rajab, a Tunisian film by the director Kaouther Ben Hania that has been nominated for an Oscar in the international feature category.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Phil BuehlerBuehler says: “The film is incredibly gut-wrenching and it does deserve an Academy award because it’s a re-enactment of the call, where the Red Crescent are taking the call, but the voice is hers.She’s on the phone. She’s five and she’s pleading, come get me. This innocent five-year-old kid has become the image of the tragedy there.”The war in Gaza has been a divisive issue in New York, which with nearly 1 million Jews has the biggest Jewish population outside Israel. Efforts to brand Zohran Mamdani, a champion of Palestinian rights,as antisemitic, fell flat as he won election to become New York’s first Muslim mayor.Buehler rejects the notion that opposition to the war equates to antisemitism. “Conflating those two things makes it more difficult to talk about,” he says. “You can’t have that conversation at all. I worry a little bit about that with this piece.“I talked to a lot of both Palestinian and Jewish friends. Most of my Jewish friends are liberal Jews and their reaction was, it’s a tragedy, their heart goes out for these kids and these families, but they are afraid bringing attention to it will bounce back as antisemitism.“So Jews are afraid of bringing attention to it and Palestinians are afraid of bringing attention to it because it bounces back against them. This moment in time in our culture and our world is not one for open dialogue. It’s so split, so tribal. ‘If you are against killing the kids in Gaza then you must be against Jews.’ That’s not true.”Explore more on these topicsArtGazaPalestineIsraelIsrael-Gaza warfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Then a keto diet gave me my life backNatalie MeadIt took six years to identify the condition that caused my chronic pain: a blood sugar dysregulation conditionFri 30 Jan 2026 06.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 30 Jan 2026 11.47 ESTShareSeven years ago, when I was 27, I got my first-ever migraine. Ten months later, it was still there.Even after the 10-month migraine ended, frequent weeks-long migraine attacks and bouts of stabbing “icepick” headaches kept me in pain more often than not. I was a software engineer at Facebook, but had to take leave from work because looking at my laptop screen made my head scream in revolt. I would never go back.Instead, over the next six years, I’d be hospitalized four times for chronic migraine disorder, the most disabling form of migraine disease, which is the second most common cause of disability globally. Chronic migraine involves, among other things, having a headache for 15 or more days per month. I’d also try all of the available medications for migraines despite their side-effects and begin avoiding bright lights, loud noises and a long list of foods that other chronic migraineurs told me could worsen my pain including gluten, tomatoes, dairy, bananas, certain varieties of onions, lemons, olive oil and anything aged – including leftovers.Early on, I visited one of the country’s top-ranked neurology practices, looking for answers. My MRI, CT scan and bloodwork were all normal, yet clearly something was wrong. But the neurologist insisted this was the end of the road.“You’re thinking of migraine like a virus, or a broken bone,” he said, “but it’s actually a Pandora’s box. And you’ve, unfortunately, already opened it.” By this he meant that my chronic migraine disorder, now unleashed, couldn’t be reversed.This doctor’s opinion was, I would soon discover, the prevailing one within the American medical establishment. Though episodic migraine – the much more common form of migraine disease – is also incurable, it can usually be managed into remission through a combination of lifestyle changes and pharmaceuticals. Chronic migraine, however, is widely considered incurable in another, much more damning sense.As the theory goes, chronic migraine is the result of a nervous system gone awry. It supposedly starts when neuroplasticity – the brain’s ability to rewire itself – snowballs into central sensitization, awidely researched phenomenonin which the nervous system is stuck in an overactivated state. This overactivated state creates migrainesex nihilo– or, at least, absent of any other physiological trigger. These migraines then sensitize the nervous system even more. In other words, it’s a pain doom loop.Central sensitization is why every chronic migraineur I’ve ever known has been told to stop fighting and accept their disease. Doctors and therapists told me to accept my migraines because there is noone-size-fits-all treatment for central sensitization, and what’s more, a hyper-sensitive nervous system can easily turn emotions like anger and fear into additional pain. This is true of other chronic pain conditions, and something I experienced first-hand (getting angry about my pain would almost always spike me to a 10 on the pain scale).Choosing to practice acceptance was one thing, but being told to do so – by medical professionals, no less – felt like being told to give up. Was I really expected to live the rest of my life like this?But acceptance seemed to be my only option, until almost a year ago, when I met Dr Kyle Bills, a neuroscientist and the founder of the Migraine and Neuro Rehab Center in Provo, Utah.“These, I think, are the problem,” he said as he pointed out sawtooth zigzags on a graph of my blood sugar readings. My migraines, it seemed, were the result of metabolic irregularities. For the past month, I’d been wearing a continuous glucose monitor that logged my blood sugar every few minutes, and each migraine episode I’d had while wearing it correlated with a rollercoaster-like spike and dip.I was stunned, and more than a little angry, though not at Bills. I was angry because I’d seen so many doctors over the past six years, even traveled across the country to a well-regarded headache specialist, but had always been told to just try a different medication or procedure. Because chronic migraine was an irreversible Pandora’s box, no one had thought to investigate possible non-neurological causes. In fact, I’d often been told that such causes either didn’t matter, or didn’t even exist.The condition that caused my chronic migraines was not central sensitization but postprandial hypoglycemia, a blood sugar dysregulation condition. In his peer-reviewed case-controlresearch study recently published in Frontiers in Neurology, Bills identified similar blood sugar dysregulation conditions in the majority of chronic migraine participants.Though Bills doesn’t deny the role that central sensitization eventually plays in migraine “chronification”, his research does refute the theory that chronic migraines are caused by a glitching nervous system. He instead posits that chronic migraine begins when ongoing blood sugar dysregulation events overwhelm the hypothalamus, the part of the brain that triggers insulin release.My first thought, upon hearing this: does this mean chronic migraine, contrary to what I’d been told, was reversible?Bills’s recommended remedy for my postprandial hypoglycemia was the ketogenic diet. Using keto to treat chronic migraines is actually not much of a stretch, as keto is already widely used totreat epilepsy, a condition that, like migraine, involves a sort of“electric storm” in the brainthat can temporarily inhibit brain function and cause inflammation. Though Bills’s most recent study isn’t about treating migraine with the ketogenic diet, this will be the focus of his future work.After I followed Bills’s advice to do a three-month medical keto diet to reset my metabolism, my migraines were no longer chronic. Though I still get occasional migraine episodes, they are infrequent and not nearly as severe. Most of the “triggers” I’d spent years avoiding also aren’t triggers any more, and though I can’t go crazy with my refined sugar intake, I’ve returned to eating a pretty normal diet – a diet that allows me to occasionally eat pizza for dinner, for example – without relapsing into postprandial hypoglycemia.Given that I still have what qualifies as episodic migraines, it would be wrong to say that Bills has cured migraines in general. But his discovery of what makes migraines turn chronic is a huge medical mic drop, as it proves that chronic migraine – a disease that affects approximately 2% of the global population – can be, in some cases, cured.When I told a pain-scientist friend about being one of the few people who have recovered from chronic migraines, she said: “I have the utmost respect for what you’re going through, but – you’re wrong.” Because she viewed chronic migraine as caused by central sensitization, my experience couldn’t exist in her world. In the end, we agreed to disagree.I’ve been in remission for 10 months now.

Here is how to transport everything without breakages – or injuriesSarah PhillipsFri 30 Jan 2026 00.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 30 Jan 2026 00.02 ESTSharePrefer the Guardian on GoogleMoving home can be incredibly stressful. How should you make sure you get everything from A to B without breakages or injuring yourself? Removal professionals share the secrets to a smash-free, smooth move.The more time, the less stressManny Sahmbi, director ofHappy2Move, a removals company in Slough, says he and his team can pack up the average four-bedroom house in a day. “Possibly even a five or six-bed house, depending on the contents.” For people doing it themselves, he recommends a week for a one-bed, a fortnight for a two-bed and so on.“Book more than one day off work to move and don’t just leave a weekend to pack,” agrees Hannah Crawford – AKAHan With a Van– who is based in north London and offers “big sister energy” when helping clients with removals all over the UK. “Not only is it going to take you a bit of time practically to get everything packed, actually do the move and then unpack, but if you don’t give yourself enough time, then everything takes much longer to settle down at the other end.” Decluttering and packing to move are two different things, says Crawford: there isn’t time to have a big sort out if moving day is imminent.Measure upView image in fullscreenThe sofa not fitting in a new place is a common problem when moving.Photograph: Posed by models. Resolution Productions/Getty Images/Tetra images RFIt is easy to forget to take measurements in advance and then not be able to fit furniture into your new home. “The sofa is a common one,” says Sahmbi. “We take it to the new place and it is too big to fit because of windy stairs or other access issues.” In this situation – and despite running a storage business too – Sahmbi cautions against paying to keep things in a unit: “From my experience, it will end up staying there for years and you’re going to regret it. I always recommend either donating to a friend or a charity shop.”Become box savvyAlways uses boxes not bags, says Crawford. “The number of times I’ve shown up and people have everything in bags and say: ‘I thought it would be easier to carry.’ They’re not. There is nothing worse than a large bag for life full of assorted, randomly shaped objects. You can’t stack them. You can’t carry multiple at a time.”It can be tempting to source spare boxes from shops to save money and be more environmentally conscious, but strong moving boxes exist for a reason. “When you are getting boxes from a supermarket, such as crisp packet boxes, they are very thin,” says Sahmbi. “They are usually single walled boxes that crumble once you stack one or two on top and they don’t protect your items very well.”View image in fullscreen‘Moving boxes are double walled so they are strong, sturdy and protect your items while in transit.’Photograph: Catherine Falls Commercial/Getty Images“You don’t want to pack all of your granny’s mugs all wrapped up into a box, only to pick it up and have it collapse and fall down a flight of stairs. No amount of packing paper and bubble wrap is saving those mugs at that point,” says Crawford.“We always recommend moving boxes because they are double walled boxes,” says Sahmbi. “They are strong, sturdy and protect your items while they’re in transit.” To save money and be more eco-friendly, look on Facebook Marketplace for local people who have just moved and have lots of boxes to get rid of. Also, find out your removal firm’s eco credentials: Sahmbi’s company buys boxes made from recycled cardboard and reuses as much as possible.Choose good quality, thick brown tape to seal boxes, says Crawford: “If you can see through it, don’t use it.”Be realistic“In the moving industry, there are two types of boxes, a large box and a small box,” says Sahmbi. “Small boxes are generally for heavier, fragile items. Bigger boxes are more for bedding, pots and pans. The bigger they are, the more awkward, so it is important they aren’t overfilled. If a box feels awkward to lift, then it is too heavy.”“Don’t overload boxes”, agrees Henry Marino-Hacking ofSelected Removalsin Cambridge, “and don’t leave empty space inside boxes – fill gaps with paper or soft items.”“Our motto for when people are packing themselves is, ‘if you pack it better, we can stack it better’,” says Sahmbi.Handle with extra careView image in fullscreen‘Mark boxes as “fragile” and stack them carefully.’Photograph: Veni vidi...shoot/Getty ImagesSahmbi regularly moves priceless antiques and artworks, for which he uses packing paper or bubble wrap (eco-friendly alternatives are available). “For specialist items such as fine china we use acid-free tissue paper.” What is best for wine glasses? “The British Association of Removers recommends packing paper, so that is what we go by,” says Sahmbi. This is easy to source online.When packing crockery, “if you individually wrap everything in bubble wrap it takes up lots of space,” says Crawford. Instead, “line the bottom and sides of your box with bubble wrap, then wrap each individual thing in some packing paper.”“Label everything,” says Marino-Hacking. “Mark boxes as ‘fragile’ and stack them carefully. If the box has extremely fragile content, mark it ‘top box’. That way, when loading the vehicle, you know not to place anything on top of it.”Move verticallyPlates are best transported upright, like vinyl, to protect them, says Sahmbi, as are TVs, screens, mirrors and framed artworks. “If you transport them flat, it allows them to flex, which is one of the causes of TV or mirror cracks.”Avoid odours“We use plastic wrap or paper bags for mattresses and soft furnishings,” says Sahmbi. “It’s not just about the dirt; these fabrics can absorb moisture and odours in transit. To prevent that from happening, it is always good to make sure that they’re wrapped.”Have a first night kitView image in fullscreen‘Pack a suitcase for the first few nights so you’re not sitting surrounded by boxes, wondering if you’ve made a massive mistake.’Photograph: Posed by models. Catherine Delahaye/Getty Images“Pack a suitcase for the first few nights,” says Crawford, “so you’re not sitting surrounded by boxes, wondering if you’ve made a massive mistake, not knowing where your toothbrush is.” Put it in a bag with other essentials such as “a kettle, mugs, tea and coffee, any daily medication,painkillers, loo roll and cutlery,” says Crawford, “so that it is all easily to hand and you’re not searching through 25 boxes.”Stay secureTo avoid it feeling like a real life game of Tetris, “place heavier items at the bottom, lighter ones on top. Fill every gap so nothing shifts in transit,” says Marino-Hacking.“Make sure that the heavy, stable items create a base, and then the fragile items are loaded last and secured safely,” says Sahmbi. “Wooden items can be safely wrapped in a blanket to ensure that they don’t get scratched or scuffed when you’re stacking stuff on top.”If you are doing the move yourself, it is worth investing in packing blankets, ratchet straps and bungee ropes, says Crawford. “Most vans will have extra brackets along the walls so you can attach and hook them up.” If in doubt, watcha YouTube tutorial, and resell them afterwards.Lift sensiblyView image in fullscreen‘A sack truck is really helpful for levering heavier items.’Photograph: Posed by models. Adam Crowley/Getty Images/Tetra images RF“Work smarter, not harder,” says Crawford. “For a heavy box, lift with the knees, keep your back straight, engage your core.” Crawford recommends getting hold of a sack truck – “a small foldable trolley, which is really helpful for levering heavier items”.Be realistic about what you can carry alone: “Nobody’s going to give you a sticker for lifting the washing machine all on your own,” says Crawford. “Everything that I’ve ever moved, I’ve been smart about it and thought: ‘How do I get this from point A to point B while taking the least amount of weight possible?’ It’s never failed me yet.”“Lift with your legs, not your back,” says Marino-Hacking. “Don’t try to carry too much at once, and always get help for heavy or awkward items. Moving is not an ideal solo sport, so recruit your friends.”“To prevent injury, you should never lift and twist at the same time,” says Sahmbi. “If your feet are not facing where the item is going down, stop and reset yourself.”Tread carefully on stairsView image in fullscreen‘If you’ve got something particularly heavy, go step by step.’Photograph: Posed by models. Miodrag Ignjatovic/Getty Images“Wrap furniture in blankets and go slowly,” says Marino-Hacking. “Sometimes it helps to remove legs from items such as sofas or dining tables, or a door might have to come off. Always have a spotter to guide you round tight corners.”“Have the strongest person at the bottom, regardless of whether you’re going up or down,” adds Crawford. “If you’ve got something particularly heavy, go step by step. Every time you pop it on the next step, have a little break.” Never rush: “Things go wrong when people are determined to get it over with,” says Crawford.Don’t lose screwsWith so much going on, losing a screw or the assembly instructions can feel almost inevitable. “With flatpack furniture, have the original manual to hand, label all parts and keep fittings and fixtures safely in a small bag – you’ll appreciate the effort when it comes to the rebuild,” says Marino-Hacking.Dress the partProtect your hands: “A pair of gardening gloves will do the job”, says Crawford, because they are often good for gripping,“which will stop things slipping out of your hands and you’re not going to get blisters.” Likewise wear sensible shoes: “I wear Timberland boots for every job,” Crawford adds. “But just a strong pair of boots will do. Don’t wear sandals.”Take care of plants and petsView image in fullscreen‘Keep pets in a quiet room until you are ready to go.’Photograph: Oscar Wong/Getty Images“Plants should travel upright in open boxes; water them lightly beforehand,” says Marino-Hacking. “If you have a heavy plant pot, emptying the soil reduces unnecessary weight for easier transport.”“For pets, keep them in a quiet room until you are ready to go, then transport them in their carrier,” says Marino-Hacking. “Try to keep their routine as normal as possible.”Don’t forget …“People often forget to defrost the freezer or redirect the mail,” says Marino-Hacking. “Be sure to check every cupboard and the loft before you lock up.”Keep yourself and any helpers well-fuelled, says Crawford. “Go for a big breakfast first, then make sure you stop for lunch and carry snacks and drinks – there is nothing worse than being hungry or super tired and trying to do this kind of stuff.”Take five minutes to say goodbye to your old home. “I don’t think people are properly prepared for the emotions of moving day,” says Crawford. “When you first arrive, your new home does not feel like home, it is an empty shell with a funny smell. Lots of people feel really desolate on the night they move in; it is a natural consequence of doing a 16-hour day. Have a box of whimsical things or favourite pictures that make you feel at home. Stick a bit of coloured tape on the box and unpack that first to make it feel like your space.”Explore more on these topicsHomesThe expertsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The fresh air, the endorphins, the reduced risk of heart disease – they’re all nice bonuses, but nothing beats that knowing nod from another rain-drenched runner, or the horrified faces of nearby dog walkers as you stride confidently into the sea for a winter dip. There’s only one catch. In order for that intoxicating feeling to exceed the very real sting of the cold, you’ll need to make sure you’re suitably layered up.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Whether you’re running, hiking or outdoor swimming, there’s some sage advice that applies across the board: “Always start by checking the weather forecast,” advises Richard Shepherd, purchasing director at mountain sports retailer Ellis Brigham. “What you wear should match the conditions you’re likely to experience. It’s the key to staying safe and comfortable outdoors.”We tapped up three experts, as well as yours truly on hiking, to get their top tips for keeping warm outdoors this winter.The best winter running gearView image in fullscreenTwo or three thin layers are better than one or two thick ones, says Nick Harris-Fry.Photograph: Nick Harris-Fry/The GuardianDressing for winter runs is tricky. It can feel freezing when you first step outside, but it won’t be long until you’re working up a sweat. Getting it right is a fine balance that comes with experience – something of which Nick Harris-Fry, co-founder ofthe Run Testers, has plenty.Be bold, start cold“Remember that you’re not just dressing for the start of the run. It’s easy to put too many layers on because you need the encouragement to get out the door, but it only takes a few minutes of running to warm up. Opting for two or three thin layers instead of one or two thick ones can help with this, because you can take a layer off once you’ve warmed up.”A good base layer is key“A good base layer will keep you warm without overheating or getting clammy, and, unless you’re braving extreme conditions, will often be the only layer you need under a jacket or top. Base layers should be soft on the skin and made from quick-drying, odour-resistant fabrics, such as merino wool.“Tracksmith’s Brighton base is comfortable and surprisingly warm given how lightweight it is. It also dries quickly and resists odours. I use it regularly through the autumn and winter months.”View image in fullscreenMen’s Tracksmith Brighton base layer£100 at TracksmithWomen’s Tracksmith Brighton base layer£100 at TracksmithA proper waterproof jacket might be overkill“For most people, a windproof, water-resistant jacket will probably be a better buy than a full waterproof. They’re cheaper, more packable, more breathable, and fend off showers pretty well in my experience.“But if you’re heading out for longer runs on trails or in more remote areas, then a waterproof jacket is invaluable in offering extra protection from the elements. Many off-road events, especially ultramarathons, will require that you have a fully waterproof jacket in your backpack, because of the protection they offer if you get stuck or lost.“The Asics Road packable jacket is windproof, water-resistant and packs away into its own pocket if conditions change or you find you’re getting too warm on a run.”View image in fullscreenMen’s Asics Road packable jacketFrom £56 at Sports Direct£89 at AsicsView image in fullscreenWomen’s Asics Road packable jacket£71.19 at SportsShoes£89 at AsicsView image in fullscreenOur pick: Decathlon Kiprun windproof running jacketMen’s, £19.99 at DecathlonWomen’s, £19.99 at DecathlonFor more, read our guides to thebest waterproof jackets for menandfor womenInsulated outerwear for only the coldest of runs“I’m a runner who’d always rather be too warm than too cold, and I have enjoyed using an insulated jacket in temperatures below 2C this winter, but I wouldn’t say it’s essential. I don’t think insulated jackets are that common for UK runners, but you see them a lot in northern Europe and parts of the US where sub-zero temperatures are common. Personally, I’d be on thetreadmillin those conditions!”Sleeves are overratedView image in fullscreenNick Harris-Fry on the track in his running gilet.Photograph: Nick Harris-Fry/The Guardian“The piece of kit that gets the most use during my winter training is actually a running gilet rather than a jacket. It’s the perfect layer for running because it keeps your core warm and blocks wind without any real risk of overheating, even on faster runs. And if it gets seriously cold, you can pop it over your jacket as an extra layer.“Saysky’s Clean Pace Flex vest is a windproof gilet that keeps my core warm without feeling restrictive or too hot during winter workouts.”View image in fullscreenSaysky Clean Pace Flex vest£55.49 at FootshopView image in fullscreenOur pick: women’s Adidas adi365 running vest£40 at Adidas£40 at NextFor more running essentials, read thebest running shoes for men and womenThe best winter hiking gearView image in fullscreenPaddy Maddison and his golden retriever, Poppy, brave the elements on a wintry hike near Alwinton in Northumberland.Photograph: Paddy Maddison/The GuardianWith fluctuations in elevation come changes in conditions that can happen quickly and be extreme at times. Being able to regulate your body temperature and protect yourself from rain, snow and wind can turn a horrible ordeal into a pleasant day out. As an outdoor-gear fanatic who writes on the matter regularly, I have some non-negotiable rules when it comes to dressing for winter hikes, andEllis Brigham’s Shepherd has a few pearls of wisdom to share too.Layers, layers, layersWhen it’s cold enough to make you think twice about leaving the house, throwing on the biggest coat you can find seems like the sensible thing to do. But remember, you won’t be standing around – you’ll be moving, most likely working up a sweat, and you need to be able to fine-tune your clothing accordingly.Being able to adjust your layers “will allow you to maintain a steady temperature whether tackling a steep ascent, resting at the summit, or speed walking to make it back before sunset”, says Shepherd.Start with a solid foundation“Base layers are the first items of clothing you wear over your underwear, next to your skin,” Shepherd says. “They wick sweat away from your body and help regulate your temperature. For hiking and other active outdoor sports, look for moisture-wicking materials such as polyester or merino wool. The former is lightweight, durable and easy to care for, while the latter is a natural fibre that’s odour-resistant and will keep you warm even when wet.”Personally, a merino base layer is the first thing I reach for when dressing for winter hikes. Look for one that fits nice and snug, hugging the torso rather than draping over it. There are dedicated brands, such asIcebreakerandSmartwool, that specialise in this type of product and charge a premium for it. They’re great, but I also have plenty of excellent merino base layers I got from bargain bins at various outdoor shops, or even from the middle aisle at Aldi. Mountain Warehouse’s merino base layers in particular have proved to be phenomenal value for money. I’ve been using them for many years, and they’re often reduced to less than £40.View image in fullscreenMen’s Mountain Warehouse merino base layer top£34.99 at Mountain Warehouse£29.50 at AmazonWomen’s Mountain Warehouse merino base layer top£34.99 at Mountain Warehouse£32 at AmazonAdd insulation accordingly“The primary purpose of a mid-layer is to add warmth,” says Shepherd. “Options vary from simple fleeces to insulated down hoodies, and you can layer them together to trap extra heat. Down insulation offers the highest warmth-to-weight ratio, making it superb for cold, dry conditions and weight-conscious activities. Ask yourself, do you want something lightweight, or do you need maximum warmth? A full-zip for easy access, or a helmet-compatible hood? What about pockets? Narrow down what’s important to you and go from there.”When I’m heading into the hills in UK winter conditions, I usually like to have two mid-layers with me – a lightweight down jacket I can pull out when I’ve stopped for a bite to eat, and something lighter and more breathable that works either on its own or layered under a shell when I’m on the move. Montbell’s EX light down anorak has been a favourite of mine this winter. It’s extremely lightweight, and I’m a big fan of the pullover design. The kangaroo pocket is great for thawing painfully cold hands too – something I appreciated immensely on a recent trip when I accidentally packed the wrong gloves.As effective an insulator as down is, it is ultimately an animal product. There are plenty of synthetic alternatives, but they tend, in my personal experience, to be less durable over time and aren’t particularly great for the environment. Unfortunately, this leaves you with a bit of an ethical toss-up whichever path you choose.I am, however, a longtime advocate of Arc’teryx’s synthetically insulated Atom hoodie, which I’ve been using for well over a decade now. It’s warm enough to take the sting out of the cold, but breathes well when I’m working hard. It has a trim fit that works nicely underneath a shell, too.View image in fullscreenMontbell EX light down anorak£405 at MontbellView image in fullscreenMen’sArc’teryx Atom hoodieFrom £207.89 at Cotswold Outdoor£260 at Arc’teryxView image in fullscreenWomen’s Arc’teryx Atom hoodie£181.89 at Cotswold Outdoor£260 at Arc’teryxBlock wind and rain with a shell (but make sure it fits)View image in fullscreenPaddy testing waterproof jackets for the Filter on a snowy hike.Photograph: Paddy Maddison/The Guardian“Most hiking waterproofs are made with room for mid-layers to be worn underneath, so you can wear your usual size,” advises Shepherd. “However, function will play a part too. A shell designed to be ultralight and low bulk will usually have a slimmer fit, and you’ll need to adjust mid-layers accordingly. Likewise, winter hiking jackets or mountaineering shells often have a more generous cut to fit insulated pieces underneath.”I’ve tested and written about waterproofs for the Filter for two years running now, and I’ve been consistently impressed by Montane’s jackets. The British brand’s Torren shell has been my go-to waterproof since it launched more than a year ago. It’s not cheap, but waterproof jackets that will actually deliver on their promise to keep you dry rarely are.View image in fullscreenMen’s MontaneTorren waterproof jacket£255.95 at Outdoor Action£300 at MontaneView image in fullscreenWomen’s MontanePhase waterproof jacket£244.89 at Cotswold Outdoor£350 at MontaneRead our guides to thebest waterproof jackets for womenand thebest waterproof jackets for menDon’t neglect your lower halfIt’s common for people to focus on their top half and forget about their legs, but your lower half needs insulation too when it’s cold out. A pair of merino leggings serves the same function as a base layer, trapping heat and keeping the body at a stable temperature. I have a few pairs from Craghoppers, which were relatively inexpensive and have had my back for everything from dog walks to ski trips.“You’ll want some thick socks too,” adds Shepherd. “Heavyweight merino-wool hiking socks are ideal. If you want extra warmth, choose a longer length sock that can cover your calves. I’ve been using Smartwool’s Hike full-cushion merino socks almost exclusively for several years now (the very first pair I bought are still going strong). They have padding in all the right places without adding too much bulk around the ankle. Nice and warm in the winter, but the natural temperature-regulating properties of the fabric mean I can use them in summer too.“Over the top, opt for soft-shell trousers. They’re typically made from stretchy, windproof fabrics that let you hike comfortably while helping block wind chill.”It’s worth carrying a pair of waterproof trousers in your pack just in case it gets wet and windy. I like Berghaus’ Deluge 2.0 trousers. They’re not the most breathable on the market, but they’re affordable, comfortable and perfect for throwing on in emergencies.View image in fullscreenSmartwool Hike full cushion crew socks£18.89 at SportsShoes£16.96 at AmazonView image in fullscreenMen’s Craghoppers merino base layer leggings£35 at Craghoppers£39.95 at LiGoWomen’s Craghoppers merino base layer leggings£30 at Craghoppers£30 at DecathlonView image in fullscreenMen’s Berghaus Deluge 2.0 waterproof trousers£80 at Berghaus£56.21 at AmazonWomen’s Berghaus Deluge 2.0 waterproof trousers£59.99 at Nevisport£75 at DecathlonDon’t miss thehiking essentialsthat walkers never leave at homeThe best cold-water swimming kitView image in fullscreenNeoprene gloves and socks are a winter-swim essential for Ella Foote.Photograph: Ella Foote/The GuardianGetting into the sea or a lake will always be cold. That’s simply the nature of the beast. But according to outdoor swimming expert (and editor ofOutdoor Swimmermagazine) Ella Foote, there are plenty of things you can do to take the edge off. And, contrary to what you might think, it’s not all about what you wearduringthe activity.Look after fingers and toes“Neoprene gloves and socks can make a cool dip or swim much more enjoyable,” says Foote. “I don’t swim without them in winter. Our fingers and toes are pretty much just bones and ligaments with very little fat, so they can feel painfully cold in winter. When you wear neoprene gloves and socks, you can lengthen your time in the water.“I didn’t realise how good these ones were until I felt how cold my swimming pal’s hands were when wearing a different brand. Look for a snug fit – too loose, and they will fill with water, which will affect your swimming and cancel any thermal benefits. Measure yourself and use the online size guides.”View image in fullscreenFourth Element neoprene gloves£60 at Fourth Element£58 at Amazon“These neoprene socks are thick enough to protect feet from shingle and rough terrain while also keeping your feet warm.”View image in fullscreenTwo Bare Feet 5mm neoprene socks£15.99 at Two Bare Feet£17.99 at AmazonGet your core temperature up“Make sure you’re warm before you get in. If your core body temperature is toasty, the overall experience will be better. I would recommend investing in a decent thermal top and leggings made from merino wool or something similar. Smartwool’s thermal base layers offer comfort, warmth and natural fibres, which still work when wet.”View image in fullscreenWomen’s Smartwool women’s merino base layer£39.97 (including membership) at Go Outdoors£73.47 at BlacksMen’s Smartwool women’s merino base layer£80 at BlacksFrom £56.05 at AmazonLayer up afterwards“Have your clothes ready in the order you’ll put them on when you get out. Your body temperature will continue to drop even when out of the water. We call this the honeymoon period. Despite feeling great and high on life, you need to dry and dress quickly, not chat and take photos. Have your coat or robe right at the bottom, and pants and thermal layers on top. You don’t want to be fumbling around when you can’t feel your fingers.”A wetsuit might not be necessary“Wetsuits provide extra buoyancy and will soften the overall chill, but they won’t make that much difference when it is 5C or under. You can also get cold trying to get them on and off. Swim your swim and learn how your body responds to cold and conditions. There are some great hybrid suits that cover the back of the neck and arms, which can reduce wind chill, but a swimsuit is often enough for short swims.“Yulex is a sustainable, plant-based alternative to traditional neoprene that offers the same thermal benefits. This suit keeps off the chill, but the panelling enables great use of movement for proper swimming.”View image in fullscreenZone3 Yulex long-sleeve swimsuit£87.50 at DecathlonCover your headView image in fullscreen‘Have a hat for swimming and one for after.’Photograph: Ella Foote/The Guardian“A neoprene hat or bonnet is brilliant if you’re doing proper head-down swimming and will ease brain-freeze. Again, our heads are big bulbs of bone, so when submerged in cold water, you’ll feel it. If you’re doing a short dip, most swimmers choose to keep their heads up out of the water, so a decent bobble hat – some offered now are waterproof – can keep the chill away. Choose natural fibres such as wool, and it will still keep warm if a bit wet. Or have one for swimming and one for after – I recommended the beanie below from British brand Finisterre, in myguide to swim essentialsfor the Filter.“This waterproof hat from Sealskinz has aTeflon coating that makes water bead up and roll off the surface, so if you get slapped by a wave, it will still keep you warm.”View image in fullscreenFinisterre beanie hat£35 at FinisterreView image in fullscreenSealskinz waterproof cold-weather beanie£24 at Sealskinz£32.95 at Outdoor ActionInvest in a good change robe“Change robes are designed to keep the weather off your body while you change underneath. They’re roomy enough for you to build up layers. A good robe should have a weatherproof outer and be insulated on the inside. Longer length is ideal, so covering your lower back, bum and tops of legs. We want our core to warm so our body can warm the rest.“This robe offers all my favourite elements as well as a lumbar warmth panel.

I always have an odd end of marzipan after the festive season, and this is a great way to use it up and bring that cosy almond flavour. The marzipan gets blitzed into the butter for a plush-textured loaf cake, and comes together in minutes thanks to simply putting everything in a food processor.Citrus and almond cakePrep10 minCook1 hr 10 min, plus coolingServes8-10200gunsalted butter, softened125g marzipan150gcaster sugarFinely grated zest and juice of 1 orange, plus 2 tbsp extra juice for the icingFinely grated zest and juice of 1 lemon3 large eggs220gplain flour50gground almonds¼ tsp fine sea salt2 tspbaking powder50gplain yoghurtTo finish100gicing sugar40g toasted flaked almondsHeat the oven to 180C (160C fan)/350F/gas 4, and grease and line a 2lb loaf tin with baking paper.Put the butter and marzipan in a food processor and blitz until smooth.

You decide who is playing happy familiesFind out how to get a disagreement settled or become a jurorInterviews byGeorgina LawtonFri 30 Jan 2026 07.48 ESTFirst published on Thu 29 Jan 2026 03.00 ESTShareThe prosecution: ChloeIt’s thoughtless to wheel me out to his familyas a formality. I need my own space sometimesMy husband Edwin comes from a big Colombian family, which is very different from the kind of environment I grew up in, and it leads to conflict between us.I had one sibling, a brother, but he passed away in a car accident when I was nine. My mum died a couple years ago. I grew up quite detached from my parents and was never that close to my father. As a result, I’m very independent and I like my own space.Dating Edwin was a challenge at first, as he is the complete opposite. He wants to be with me all the time, but also wants me to spend time with his family. He’s like a big labrador.Edwin loves kids. He has five brothers and sisters and around 20 nieces and nephews. I also like kids, but I like my space too. We’re in our early thirties and want a family one day, but not yet. The other week he got annoyed when I wasn’t able to go to his goddaughter’s seventh birthday party with him because I’d made plans to attend my best friend’s birthday.We were surrounded by his whole family and the kids were screaming. After hours of board games, I had to lie down because I had a headacheHe said: “But what will people think?” It seemed that his biggest concern wasn’t about us spending time together, but about me showing my face in front of his family. I told him that I have a life, and that I’d made plans to be at my friend’s birthday ages ago, but he wasn’t able to see it from my point of view. He even said I was being thoughtless. But I think it’s thoughtless to wheel me out to his family just as a formality. I don’t even know his goddaughter very well.Edwin also got annoyed with me at Christmas. We were surrounded by his whole family and kids were screaming. After hours of board games, I had to lie down because I had a headache. He told me later that was rude, but to me it would have been ruder if I had stayed up with a scowl on my face.Maybe Edwin finds it hard to see my point of view because he and I only see my father twice a year: it’s way less hands-on. We’ve been together for four and a half years and get on very well, but he needs to understand I can’t always spend time with his family.You be the judge – send us your domestic disputesRead moreThe defence: EdwinFamily is at the centre of things. I want Chloe to feel included and to show my relatives we’re a unitIt hurts when Chloe calls my family “a lot”. When you grow up surrounded by noise and people coming and going, you forget that not everyone experiences family the same way.For me, family has always been at the centre of everything: not because it’s perfect, but because it’s constant. When things go wrong, you don’t retreat. I didn’t lose anyone growing up like Chloe did, and we’ve talked about how that’s shaped our attitudes. I admire her, but she is so hyper-independent at times – when we first started going out, it was hard for her to let me in.When I ask her to come to family events, it’s not about wheeling her out like a prop. It’s about inclusion, showing everyone that I have my person and that she’s part of us. When Chloe doesn’t come, I feel a little silly and maybe a bit exposed. Everyone asks me where she is, because there’s an expectation in my family that she should come to everything I go to as we are a unit. She doesn’t get that and it’s hard sometimes.I know she has a low social battery, and at Christmas when she disappeared to lie down, I wasn’t angry – I was embarrassedMy goddaughter’s party symbolised our togetherness, and I had to fend off lots of questions from relatives, which was embarrassing. Chloe said she had a friend’s birthday but that wasn’t a super-important event either. I knew it was important to her though, which is why I didn’t get annoyed.I know she has a low social battery, and at Christmas when she disappeared to lie down, I wasn’t angry, just embarrassed because I had to cover for her in front of my family.When it comes to having kids, I worry that she may want to parent them differently. She likes her space, whereas I prefer being in a community and having everyone coming over to help with the baby. I love her, but I also love the big family chaos.I’m trying to adjust to her way of being, but we don’t spend time with her family. That’s not my fault – or hers. But I do need her to see that when I ask her to come to my family events, it’s not about optics, it’s about belonging.The jury of Guardian readersShould Edwin put less pressure on Chloe?I’m with Chloe. Just as Edwin has his family, Chloe has her friends and her obligations to them. And we all have the right to rest, regardless of circumstance. Edwin’s expectations are unfair.Jessica, 21Chloe understands their different perspectives and tries to accommodate them. I find it disturbing that Edwin labelled her headache break as rudeness. His own words suggest that this is more about his ego when he is with family.Eleanor, 66Edwin’s wish to include Chloe in family events is rooted in love and his culture, but he frames her need for space as something to overcome rather than respect. Without clear expectations, this mismatch risks long-term resentment – especially if they have a family together.Chris, 37Edwin and his family expect Chloe to be wholeheartedly present at all gatherings, and there’s no wriggle room for Edwin to explain her absence. He needs to explain to his family that Chloe has a different approach and may not always be present.Simon, 45Edwin must listen to what Chloe is saying and stop needing to “show” her to his family. Families can mean well while being intrusive. This conflict could deepen with the arrival of a newborn, as a baby can leave new parents overwhelmed and exhausted.Avril, 71Now you be the judgeIn our online poll, tell us: is Edwin expecting too much of Chloe?The poll closes on Wednesday 4 February at 9am GMTLast week’s resultsWe asked whetherRandy should stop quoting song lyrics at his wifeduring serious conversations.60%of you said yes –Randy is guilty40%of you said no –Randy is innocentExplore more on these topicsLife and styleYou be the judgeWomenfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But the 2026 winner (an unremarkable off-white called Cloud Dancer) struck me as even less relevant when trends are finally looking interesting again.The Guardian’s journalism is independent.

The appointment of Roan – all grunge glitters, colourful face jewels and clumpy mascara – celebrates the experimental, edgy and playful Mac aesthetic, and signals what may be the end of what industry figures often describe as the “beige buffet” of post-Covid fashion and beauty.Oh, the relief in seeing the back of all-over “camel”, in enjoying makeup textures other than perfectly smooth and “glassy”, the joy in a glinty eyelid or gemstone applied haphazardly and for no other reason but fun.The effect on my mood of wearing a touch of slightly silly colour to work is noticeableMac has the appropriate toolkit at the ready: itsConnectin Color palettes(£46) contain 12 eyeshadows in textures from smooth mattes to chunky glitters in interesting, but complementary, shades (even theUnfiltered Nudesoption feels edgy).The formulas are easy enough to smoosh on carelessly with fingers and provide a stable foundation for plenty of smudgy kohl – Roan wears Mac’s sootyFelineEye Kohl(£20).Cool-girl brand Violette FR is also pushing this fresh, more creative approach to beauty. Its tremendousLune Liners(£35) give a striking eye effect in return for little effort – their holographic finish means that any wobbles in your stroke don’t quite register. I’m wearing Cuivre 29 – Big Bird yellow from one angle, acid green from another – with my regular makeup, and the effect on my mood of wearing a touch of slightly silly colour to work is noticeable.Sali Hughes on beauty: why lactic acid is your ultimate skincare heroRead moreThis move toward “dopamine beauty” is embodied by makeup artist and social media starEmily Wood(younger sister of White Lotus actor Aimee Lou Wood), who has built a large audience by ostensibly daubing on 1970s turquoise eyeshadow, crude swipes of canary yellow and glitter that spills over her nose, but the overall aesthetic of her Instagram grid is deceptively intentional.Also carefully considered are the superb multi-finish palettes of US-based makeup artist Danessa Myricks, who makes glittery, chromatic and glossy eye looks seem perfectly fine for a lunch date.

During four days of challenging hiking and wild camping through the area we saw hardly anyone else, having entire lush green valleys and still glacial lakes to ourselves. We were fortunate to have stunning weather throughout and, despite it being July, still had a reasonable amount of snow to traverse. Norway has a fantastic network of signposted trails and huts which can be found on theNorwegian Trekking Association website.BenAn arty cabin break near AarhusView image in fullscreenThe Kunstmuseum’s walkway.Photograph: Wirestock/AlamyWe had an amazing family holiday on the Jutland coast neat Aarhus, Denmark’s second city. We stayed in a cabin among pine trees and swam every day. We found helpful swimming jetties, making it simple to get into the sea – they even have hooks for towels. The beaches were wild and so quiet we often had them to ourselves. For an urban fix, Aarhus was a joy to visit.

Lahti is full of charming little cafes and quiet, down-to-earth people, not to mention scenes straight from a fairytale. I spent a month studying here as a student nurse and was equally amazed by the Finnish approach to public health as I was by how comfortable -22C can feel. Between days on placement, I spent time going for long walks over the frozen Lake Vesijärvi (a truly surreal experience) before enjoying Finnish coffee culture atKahvila Kariranta, a former railway station turned cafe. There’s lots of ice skating and cross-country skiing, or, if you’re looking to unwind, you’re never far from a sauna, which in Finland is viewed as a necessity not a luxury.EstherA horse ride through Norwegian mountainsView image in fullscreenRondane national park.Photograph: Norphoto/AlamyWhy hike when you can horse ride? To get off the tourist trail, we opted to explore Norway’sRondane national parkon smallish but strong dole horses (a Norwegian breed) last summer. The horses were gorgeous, incredibly patient – although I can ride, my friend had barely sat on a horse since riding ponies on the beach as a kid – and really sure-footed as they navigated the mountain paths. It was a brilliant way to get deeper into the countryside and take things at a slower pace, giving us plenty of time to take in the views and hear stories about the area from our guide. The holiday was organised byGutsy Girls.FlissIsland of sunshine in DenmarkView image in fullscreenBornholm enjoys above average sunshine hours for the Baltic region.Photograph: Image Professionals /AlamyBornholm island is Danish, but set in the middle of the Baltic between Poland and Sweden. It has beaches of fine white sand and secluded coves – perfect in summer when the island enjoys sunnier weather than most of the surrounding region. History is everywhere, from one of the largest ruined medieval castles in Europe – Hammershus–to remnants of Soviet occupation in 1945-46 and distinctive circular churches. Fish smokeries offer herring, salmon and eel, while bakeries provide the best Danish pastries. Stay at one of Bornholm’s seaside hotels, enjoy the sunsets and you will never want to leave.Robert GilchristSweden’s wooden wonderView image in fullscreenNora is one of three ‘wooden towns’.Photograph: Mikdam/Getty ImagesThe lakeside town of Nora, 130 miles inland from Stockholm, is one of Sweden’s three “wooden towns” (along with Eksjö and Hjo), where all the buildings are made of timber from the surrounding forests. The town and its surrounding area have a timeless feel of a wealthy bygone age belonging to Nordic nobility. I strolled around Nora’s cobblestone streets and visited the perfectly preserved 19th-century villaGöthlinska Gården. I spent another afternoon in Glasstorget (Ice-Cream Square) to try the local ice-cream, Noraglass. On another day, I wandered around the streets of theKvarteret Bryggerietcreative quarter – full of independent shops, eateries and with a fascinating microbrewery. The nearby lakes (Norasjön, Fåsjön and Usken) are gorgeous and great for swimming and picnics.JoDesign gems near CopenhagenView image in fullscreenThe petrol station designed by Arne Jacobsen, with hints of the Starship Enterprise.Photograph: Niels Quist/AlamyA great advantage in revisiting a city is venturing further afield, beyond the obvious tourist sights. Returning to Copenhagen, we went in search of one of its most famous architects, Arne Jacobsen, travelling just 6 miles outside the centre. AtBellevue Beach, Klampenborg, an area perfect for summer promenading, Jacobsen built an iconic theatre, a restaurant, the angular Søholm houses, and gleaming-white Bauhaus-influenced apartment buildings. But that’s not all – he even designed the local kiosks and blue-stripedlifeguard towers. Twenty minutes stroll down the coast, there’s also a strikingJacobsen petrol station(now part ice-cream parlour) with oval-shaped canopy somewhat reminiscent of the Starship Enterprise.David MQuietly thrilling Finnish designView image in fullscreen‘Gentle colour palettes’ at the Paimio sanatoriumVisiting Alvar Aalto’sPaimio sanatoriumis a quietly thrilling pilgrimage. Set among pine forests in south-west Finland, the building feels tuned to light, air and human dignity. Designed in the 1930s for tuberculosis patients, every detail tells a story: gentle colour palettes to soothe minds, silent sinks to aid rest, chairs shaped for easier breathing. Walking its corridors offers deep insight into Finnish culture – pragmatic, compassionate, nature-led. History lingers in patient rooms and sun balconies, yet the place feels timelessly modern. For design lovers and curious travellers alike, it’s an energising, moving visit, worth seeking out on any trip.Stephen EdwardsWinning tip: explore Oslo’s diverse islandsView image in fullscreenSmall houses close to Oslo on Bleikøya island.Photograph: zkk600/Getty ImagesSpend a blissful summer day island-hopping in the inner Oslofjord.

A growl that sounded like a death warningKen JohnsonFri 30 Jan 2026 00.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 30 Jan 2026 07.43 ESTShareLast November, I’d been out for the evening with friends who were visiting Los Angeles. Afterwards, I checked the notifications on my phone. There was a motion alert from one of the cameras around my house. It had captured a big black bear nosing around my bins.We get wildlife here: raccoons, skunks. But I’d never had a bear rummaging through my trash. I watched as it turned things over, then wandered off. I assumed he had left.The next morning, I checked the critter-cams and saw the bear again, now captured by a camera I’d placed by a little mesh-covered opening near the small basement under my house. I watched as a massive shape emerged from the hole. My brain refused to believe it. The bear looked too large to fit in that tiny gap. I watched it again, shocked. My hands started to sweat.0:37CCTV footage showing the bear coming out of Johnson's basementI scrolled back through the footage. There he was, hours earlier, pushing his body into my home. That evening, I showed the clips to a few friends, who laughed and swore. One said, “Ken, you’ve got to do something about this.”The next day, I watched the bear come out in the early morning – then that camera died. I went around to change the batteries. I heard this huff, then a stomp. A growl that felt like a death warning. I glimpsed him, and my body went straight into fight-or-flight. I ran back inside my house, started shaking and couldn’t stop.After that, my life split into two. There was ordinary life – making coffee, feeding my indoor cat, Boo – and life with the bear. I monitored the cameras, wondering what was happening beneath me. It was as if I was the guy in the upstairs apartment and he the tenant below. Boo would hear banging under the floor and go running, then look at me with wide eyes as if to say: are you hearing this?View image in fullscreenThe bear walking around Johnson’s house, past the column he partially demolishedI tried everything people suggested: stomping, blasting music, creating “bad neighbour fratboy energy” – all to make the bear leave. Nothing worked. If anything, he seemed to settle in deeper. My imagination got dramatic. I’d hear a scrape and wake up at five in the morning in a panic.When the Department of Fish andWildlifegot involved, the situation got more serious and more absurd. They set up a bear trap in my neighbour’s driveway and laid a scent trail that smelled like sardines and cherries. It didn’t work, so they switched to butterscotch. I cannot tell you how haunting butterscotch becomes when you associate it with a 550lb (250kg) bear living under your floor. I’d open a window and my stomach would turn.The bear, meanwhile, was not being lured anywhere. He’d come out at night for a while, circle the patio, hunt for food, then squeeze back under my house. Watching him force himself through that gap was painful. His belly scraped. His body contorted. Every time, the last thing to disappear was his enormous paw.I’d hear a scrape and wake up at five in the morning in a panicI had prepared a wooden panel to block the opening, but it was too dangerous to fit it when he was nearby. Once, when I did get it in place, he just swatted it aside.Before long, the media showed up, and the neighbourhood came alive. People wandered over to reporters and said things like, “Oh yeah, he was in our yard last week.” Or, “He tipped over our trash.” And I’d think, “Then he came back and crawled under my house.” Locally, he’s known as “Unbearable” or “Volkswagen” because he’s the size of one.Then, a few weeks ago, we did the impossible.

After a long winter (they always feel long) seasonal change starts to loom. Yet I remind myself why, for many of the plants and crops we love, a sustained cold period is essential.While little plant growth takes place in winter, important biological processes happen in this stillness. For a great number of plants that are able to survive cold weather, a good period spent below a certain temperature is key to their flowering in spring – a process called vernalisation.The exact temperature and duration each plant needs to spend below it depends on the species and even the variety, although most of the fruit trees we grow outdoors in the UK have this “chill requirement”. For example, apple trees need to be exposed to between 700 and 1,000 hours below 6C (43F) but above freezing. Interestingly, plant breeders are developing varieties that have a far lower winter chill requirement so that apples can be grown in warmer climates than the UK’s, which is naturally ideal for them.A magical thing some plants do to alleviate the cold is break down starch into sugars, so they are tastier for usAnother crop that requires vernalisation in order to develop optimally is garlic. A period of cold weather below 6C for about eight weeks triggers a seed clove to produce a number of cloves as it grows. This is why we sow our garlic from early winter through to January. If you’re lucky enough to live somewhere where the temperature doesn’t drop low enough for long enough to be sure your garlic will develop a bulb with numerous cloves, you could put your seed garlic in the fridge, stored in a paper bag, to mimic the vernalisation process.For seed savers, vernalisation is a key part of the journey of biennial crops. Carrots, beetroot and parsley all produce vegetative growth in their first season, when they tend to be harvested and consumed. But if you want to replenish your seed stock from these plants, they will need to make it through winter and into spring, where vernalisation will ensure that they flower, poised to produce the seeds.Want to keep growing through winter? Try microgreens, indoor miracles bursting with flavourRead moreThere’s another magical thing that certain plants do when the mercury starts to drop, and that is protect themselves from the cold. They do this by breaking down starch into sugars, which are more able to resist the cell-wall busting effects of frost.This is a bonus for us eaters as it makes these vegetables even more palatable. So if you’re ever trying to convince someone of the tastiness of leeks, kale, carrots, beetroot or turnip, offering up a platter of vegetables that were exposed to the cold before being picked will make a more compelling case.Explore more on these topicsGardensGardening advicefeaturesShareReuse this content"

The protester was already detained, three other agents pressing his body into the pavement, but the agent can nevertheless be seen spraying the orange chemical irritant, which causes excruciating pain, at point-blank range.The agent probably thought he would enjoy anonymity for this bit of brutality. Thefederal police terrorizing Minneapolisremain largely nameless as they dole out horrifying – and in two cases, fatal – violence against anyone opposingOperation Metro Surge. But within two hours of the Star Tribune posting the footage to social media, a group called Pacific Antifascist Research Collectiveclaimedto have identified him.Minneapolis ICE watchers face violence, teargas and arrests. They keep showing upRead moreThe collective – which days earlier promised in a post to “identify ICE terrorists until ICE’s campaign of terror is stopped and the armed thugs and their leadership are held accountable” – made flyers of the agent’s face for people to share online, or to print out and tape to telephone poles and buildings acrossMinneapolis.“TYLER GRAMLIN”, screamed the text on the flyers in English, Spanish, Hmong, Somali and Tagalog. “SUSPECTED KIDNAPPER/TERRORIST”.The Pacific Antifascist Research Collective did not publicly share the methods it used to identify Gramlin, but I know its research to be reliable. Its activists follow exacting editorial standards, a tendency born from the desire to be trusted by their communities; any missteps can destroy the credibility of the whole project. The collective describes itself as an “autonomous group” of “researchers dedicated to providing communities from the Rockies to the Pacific with research and tools to protect themselves from fascism in all its forms”. Its members, like most of the 60 or so other antifascists I talked to for my new book,To Catch a Fascist: The Fight to Expose the Radical Right, keep their own identities a secret to prevent reprisals from the far right.This modern iteration of antifa grew in response to an alarming new cadre of white supremacist groups that emerged during Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign. Although antifa is most commonly associated in the public imagination with punching Nazis, such militancy represents a tiny fraction of its activism. The story of antifa – a subculture of anarchists, socialists and communists dedicated to destroying the far right “by any means necessary” – is remarkable not so much for its violence, which is rare, but for its espionage and research. Over the last decade it has exposed the identities of thousands of pseudonymous Americans belonging to this new generation of fascists, sometimes deploying spies to go undercover into white supremacist groups and gather intelligence – including secretly recorded audio, covert photos and thousands of private chat messages – that would be used to unmask professors, politicians, police officers and pastors.View image in fullscreenA masked ICE agent standing guard in Minneapolis, Minnesota, on Wednesday.Photograph: Dave Decker/ZUMA Press Wire/ShutterstockAlthough “doxing” often refers to posting someone’s private information online, such as an address or phone number, as a means of inviting harassment, in the antifascist context it refers to the modern practice of naming and shaming fascists – similar to ripping the white hood off a Klansman. Antifa’s use of this tactic, I found, was often successful, helping destroy multiple fascist or “alt-right” groups during Donald Trump’s first term in office, and beyond.We identify ICE and DHS agents for the same reasons we identify any violent, dangerous people intent on doing harmRileyAt the dawn of the second Trump administration, however, antifa’s intelligence-gathering operations were repurposed for a new target: the armed agents of the state carrying out Trump’s promise to mass-deport 100 million people. Antifa is now working to name and shame the president’s secret police. To unmaskla migra.A longtime antifa activist we’ll call Riley, whose real name they asked be withheld for their protection, is currently involved in researching the identities of ICE and CBP agents. Riley told me these agents often wear masks because they know most Americans “hate” the havoc they are wreaking across the country.“They want to go about their lives and to enjoy life without being recognized as kidnappers and abusers in their community,” Riley said. “We identify ICE and DHS agents for the same reasons we identify any violent, dangerous people intent on doing harm. They have chosen to prey on the community.”By the numbers: the latest ICE and CBP data on arrests, detentions and deportations in the USRead moreThere are nowmore than 70,000 human beingslanguishing in America’s immigration detention centers, an all-time high. Report after report has detailed theinhumane conditionsat these jail complexes, where detainees have accused DHS and ICE agents ofsexual abuse,medical neglectandassault. Thirty-two people died after being detained in these places in 2025, making it thedeadliestyear in more than two decades. Only one month into 2026, six people havediedin ICE custody. One of those deaths was recentlyruleda homicide.“These traveling terrorists need a place to sleep,” Riley said of agents who send immigrants – some of them young children – to these centers, which experts havearguedcan reasonably be called concentration camps. “They need to get coffee, eat, go to the bathroom, go to the gym, get gas, rent a car like anyone else. Predators should not be able to enjoy anonymity.”There is a long, proud American tradition of unmasking fascists. Black activists and investigative journalists such as Ida B Wells and Walter White labored for decades, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, to strip the white lynch mobs terrorizing the south of their anonymity, identifying individual executioners and demanding they face justice. In 1924, the mayor of Buffalo, New York, enlisted a spy to go undercover into the city’s large Ku Klux Klan chapter, eventually obtaining a list of members and putting it on display downtown so Buffalonians could learn which of their neighbors hid behind white hoods at night to burn crosses. In Los Angeles in the 1930s, a Jewish lawyer named Leon Lewis operated a spy network to infiltrate the German American Bund, foiling Nazi plots to massacre the city’s Jews. In the 1940s, activist Stetson Kennedy went undercover into the Klan in Georgia, stealing away thousands of invaluable documents. In the 1980s and 90s, young punks belonging to groups such as Anti-Racist Action would go dumpster-diving outside the homes of neo-Nazi skinheads, retrieving discarded mail with the Nazis’ real names and eventually posting “MEET YOUR LOCAL NAZI” posters in their neighborhoods.View image in fullscreenA protester at the Whipple federal building outside Minneapolis holds a sign demanding ICE agents take off their masks on 18 January.Photograph: Riley Harty/Zuma Press Wire/ShutterstockAnd most recently, as detailed in my book, antifa deployed spies into groups such as Identity Evropa and into online servers where neo-Nazis were plotting violent rallies like Unite the Right in Charlottesville, Virginia. This work was successful because it brought sunlight to groups which depended on organizing in the dark.Antifa’s doxing tactic leveraged existing societal taboos against explicit white supremacy or neo-Nazism to create a social cost for being a fascist.Oh, you want to join a Nazi group? We will name and shame you. You will lose your job. You will lose your girlfriend. Your family will shun you.Although it is true we are now living through a “mask-off” moment for fascism, with Trump and the Republican party indulging in constant, explicit white supremacist rhetoric, it’s also true that Maga’s ethnonationalist project is experiencing a deepening unpopularity. A recent YouGovpollshowed support for the phrase “abolish ICE” reaching record levels among US adults, at 46%, with 41% opposed. (Nearly 20% of Republicans support abolishing the agency.) Fifty-six per cent of AmericansbelieveICE agents should not be allowed to wear masks.More aboveground efforts are under way to unmask ICE, but they are slow-moving and not always reliable. In September Democratic lawmakers in California passed the No Secret Police Act, which would prohibit ICE and border patrol agents from wearing masks, and the No Vigilantes Act, which would require them to wear a form of identification. The White House sued over the legislation, and legal observers arepessimisticabout the bills’ chances of surviving in court. (Similar laws have been introduced in about 15 states.)[ICE agents are] a small bunch of wannabe Nazis ... in a country of 350 million. We outnumber themLarry KrasnerThere is also ICE List, a website run by Dominick Skinner, a 32-year-old Irishman living in the Netherlands, which cobbles together tips about the identities of immigration agents. Skinnertold the Irish Timeshe started the website after seeing the homeland security secretary, Kristi Noem, threaten to arrest Americans who identified ICE agents online. “So I just reshared that and said: ‘That’s cool, I’m not in the US – so send them to me and I’ll do it,’” Skinner told the paper. Skinner claims to have since received the names of ICE agents from bartenders who check their IDs, and from hotel workers where the agents check in as guests.This week in Philadelphia, Larry Krasner, the city’s district attorney, used perhaps the most aggressive language to date by an elected official towards ICE, warning the agency it would not escape justice. “This is a small bunch of wannabe Nazis – that’s what they are – in a country of 350 million. We outnumber them,” hesaidof the federal agents, before adding: “If we have to hunt you down the way they hunted down Nazis for decades, we will find your identities, we will find you, we will achieve justice, and we will do so under the constitution and the laws of the United States.”Antifa, meanwhile, is not waiting around for indictments and prosecutions. Its project to unmask ICE is small, but growing, with a handful of groups taking part. In Portland, Oregon, a group called Rose City Counter-Info has identified at least two local agents. “We put together some posters for people to slap up around town,” the group wrote in a post. “Name and shame these Gestapo clowns.”In July the DHS lashed out against the “anarchists and rioters” in Portland identifying ICE officers, naming Rose City Counter-Info among them. “We will prosecute those who dox ICE agents to the fullest extent of the law,” Noem warned. “These criminals are taking the side of vicious cartels and human traffickers.” A few months later federal law enforcementarrestedthree women in Los Angeles for allegedly livestreaming their pursuit of an ICE agent to his home, the address of which they allegedly posted online. The women were each charged with publicly disclosing the personal information of a federal agent. Thestatutethat they were charged with, however, will require prosecutors to prove the women had “the intent to threaten, intimidate or incite the commission of a crime of violence” against the agent. The women, all of whom have pleaded not guilty, will probably argue they were doing something else: simply identifying taxpayer-funded employees of the state.Eight people have died in dealings with ICE so far in 2026. These are their storiesRead moreThe Trump administration is pursuing more prosecutions like this, an effort that, if successful, could essentially codify ICE as its secret police force. In December the justice departmentissued a memoto federal prosecutors to create a strategy for targeting individuals aligned with “antifa” who are “doxing” and “impeding” immigration law enforcement. The memo came a couple of months after Trump claimed todesignate antifaa “domestic terrorist organization”, even though there is no federal law to make such a designation. Pam Bondi has directed federal law enforcement to ramp up intelligence gathering efforts on these groups.“Antifa is not an organization,” Riley told me. “Antifascism is a natural response to state terror. Antifascist action belongs to the people. Anyone can do it.“Every day this goes on,” they continued, referring to the brazen brutality of border patrol agents seen across the country, “DHS creates thousands of new antifascists.”Pacific Antifascist Research Collective is continuing to identify ICE agents. A recent flyer claimed to identify one of the agents seen removing a shirtless, elderly Hmong man from his home in handcuffs, bringing him into the freezing cold while his grandchild looked on through the window. Another flyer claimed to identify the ICE agent always at the side of Gregory Bovino, the border patrol commander who was demoted on Monday. And yet another flyer claimed to identify the ICE agent seen in a video seeming to threaten a protester: “You raise your voice, I erase your voice.”Reached for comment, the Department of of Homeland Security did not dispute that Tyler Gramlin had been accurately identified by Pacific Antifascist Research Collective as the border patrol agent seen pepper-spraying the protester in Minneapolis. In a statement to the Guardian, spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin stated only that the agent’s actions were part of “crowd control measures” used to “disperse a hostile crowd,” and claimed without evidence that the officer had been assaulted. (The Guardian is not aware of evidence substantiating the collective’s characterization of Gramlin as a “kidnapper/terrorist”.)Gramlin himself seemed to acknowledge the accuracy of antifa’s flyers’ identification last week. After the collective named him online, the 33-year-old logged into Facebook and changed his cover photo to an aerial image of a frozen landscape in Greenland, the territory Trump is currently threatening to invade and annex. “Heard you are a terrorist …” one of Gramlin’s friends commented on the photo. Gramlin gave the comment a thumbs-up emoji.The nefarious message behind the DHS ‘manifest destiny’ painting: ‘four pillars of propaganda’Read moreReached for comment by the Guardian via text message, Gramlin did not deny being the agent seen pepper-spraying the protester, instead responding with an Amelia meme –popularamong racist far-right nationalists in the UK – showing a cartoon of a young white girl in London, waving a union jack flag, with text beneath her reading: “DEFEND YOUR HOMELAND – NOW OR NEVER.”Riley, the antifascist, has a message for agents like Gramlin: you might feel invincible now, but the people are turning against you, and the people will win.“For those of you already in ICE and CBP, take your retirement while you still can,” Riley said. “Get out before the funding cuts, before the lawsuits, the criminal trials. Do not volunteer for these assignments.“Think about your future,” they continued. “Think about your family’s future. Forever is a long time. The people will not forget.”To Catch a Fascist: The Fight to Expose the Radical Right isout5 FebruaryExplore more on these topicsICE (US Immigration and Customs Enforcement)Minnesota ICE shootingsUS immigrationFar right (US)US foreign policyRaceMinnesotafeaturesShareReuse this content"

Hitting military sites? It is unclear what a US attack on Iran would achieveDan SabbaghDefence and security editorDonald Trump now has the firepower in place, but using it might not end wellFri 30 Jan 2026 08.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 30 Jan 2026 14.20 ESTShareA fortnight ago, when Donald Trump first threatened Iran’s regime, telling protesters in the country that “help is coming”, there werenot enough US military assetsin the Middle East to back up the rhetoric. That has now changed, although plenty of questions remain about what an attack on Iran could achieve.An aircraft carrier, the USS Abraham Lincoln, has arrived in the Indian Ocean, dispatched from the South China Sea alongside three destroyers equipped with Tomahawk cruise missiles. Its eight-squadron air wing includes F-35C and F/A-18 jets and, critically, EA-18G Growlers to suppress anything that is left of Iran’s air defences after last year’s war with Israel.Open-source monitors have spotted transport planes bringing what they believe to be US air defence systems to the Gulf. That isin line with reportsthat Patriot and Thaad antimissile batteries would be deployed to protect US bases from any Iranian drone and missile counterattack against military sites in the region.On top of that, squadrons of F-15 fighters – an estimated 35 planes – have been redeployed from RAF Lakenheath in Suffolk to Muwaffaq Salti airbase in Jordan. It had been intended for the F-15s to be flown back to the US, but now they have been deployed as extra defensive cover for Israel, Jordan, Iraq and the region if the conflict escalates.Michael Carpenter, a former member of the US national security council, under Joe Biden, believes that the most plausible military option would be to go after Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, a capture-or-kill operation modelled on the seizure of Venezuela’s former president Nicolás Maduro. Targeting other key Iranian military sites would not obviously degrade the country’s regime significantly, he added. “I find it unlikely, dubious, that these would have the strategic effects sought,” he said.Targeting Khamenei, Carpenter argues, would be “a very fraught operation with a dubious outcome”. The success of the seizure of Maduro relied, partly, on “exquisite intelligence from the inside”, he said, built upover five months of preparationby the CIA and sources within Maduro’s government, but it was unclear how far that existed in the case of Iran, even allowing for possible Israeli help.Israel was chillingly successful in assassinating Iranian leaders during last June’s 12-day war, though afterwards Israeli sources revealed a key method for tracing their locations was tracking the bodyguards’ mobile phones. Procedures ought to have been tightened up. And as the Israeli foreign minister, Israel Katz, acknowledged,Khamenei’s security precautions kept him out of their sightsthat summer.Iran is not likely to have much air defence to protect itself from Tomahawks or incoming jets. Last June, Israeli jets were quickly able to fly over large parts of the country, without suffering losses, paving the way for the US bombing of the nuclear enrichment site under the mountain at Fordow. This month, the US was able to suppress Venezuela’s air defence within a couple of hours.However, a capture operation would have to range over considerable distance (Tehran is about 1,000 miles from the Indian Ocean), which could tip the crude military thinking towards an assassination attempt. That in turn would represent an extraordinary escalation: an attempt by the US to kill the leader of another country with which it is not at war, and from which it faces no immediate threat.A western analyst, who asked not to be named, said they believed a US attempt to try and kill Iran’s supreme leader “is more likely than a capture attempt – and also less risky if it were to involve a standoff munition” – though it would also “depend heavily on the intelligence and the number of people who’ve been co-opted (if any have been) from his protective detail”.Map of US bases in Middle EastThe question then is what would follow. Iran’s regime has been cohesive enough to violently suppress demonstrators,killing perhaps 30,000. If Khamenei were to be killed it is not obvious that any successor would suddenly shift policy in whatever direction the White House seeks. Though Khamenei has shortlisted three potential successors, there may be a struggle for power the US simply cannot control.What is more certain is there would be an immediate military response. On Sunday, Iran’s president, Masoud Pezeshkian, warned that any attack on Khamenei would amount toa declaration of war. Iran’s most potent available form of defence is attack, particularly from high-speed ballistic missiles (whose stock is estimated at 2,000) stored in “missile cities” deep below ground.Trump tells Iran: end nuclear ambitions and stop killing protesters or face US militaryRead moreThe most obvious target for a missile attack, combined with drones, would be the Abraham Lincoln and its allied warships. But Matthew Savill of the Royal United Services Institute argues that Iran “may not be able to fix its position” with available surveillance because it will be sailing out in the Indian Ocean. “The US knows the closer to the Persian Gulf it goes, the more visible it is to the Iranians,” he added.An alternative counterstrike would be to target US military bases in the Gulf, such as al-Udeid airbase in Qatar, headquarters to US Central Command. This month the base was reinforced by new Patriot air defence systems according toChinese satellite imagery, but a consideration for the US is that last June 14% of Iranian ballistic missiles got past sophisticated Israeli and US air defences.This, though, would risk international escalation, bringing Gulf states and their allies automatically into the conflict. The UK has alreadyforward deployed the RAF’s 12 Squadron, a joint UK-Qatari unit at al-Udeid, to deter a possible attack and help the Qataris act in self defence. Another alternative for Iran could be to try andmine the strait of Hormuz, closing it to merchant shipping, though that would rely on submarines that the US will be closely monitoring underwater.Iran’s military options may be limited, but so too are the White House’s prospects of achieving an instant knockout.Explore more on these topicsIranUS foreign policyMiddle East and north AfricaanalysisShareReuse this content"

But experts warn users could reshape the world to win bigNiamh RoweFri 30 Jan 2026 07.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 30 Jan 2026 15.15 ESTShareIn the early hours of 13 June, more than 200 Israeli fighter jets began pummeling Iran with bombs, lighting up the Tehran skyline and initiating a 12-day war that would leave hundreds dead.But for one user of the prediction market Polymarket, it was their lucky day. In the 24 hours before the strike occurred, they had bet tens of thousands of dollars on “yes” on the market “Israel military action against Iran by Friday?” when the prospect still seemed unlikely and odds were hovering at about 10%. After the strike, Polymarket declared that military action had been taken, and paid the user $128,000 for their lucky wager.But was it just luck?Polymarket is an online platform where people can bet on just about anything, from what the most-streamed song on Spotify will be to how many times Donald Trump will say “terrible” that day. Under Joe Biden, the unregulated site was banned in the United States, although it could be accessed with a VPN. Now, over $100m worth of bets are placed on Polymarket each day.The user who had placed the bet was new to Polymarket. Since then they have lodged five bets on similar markets like, “Israel announces end of military operations against Iran before July?” and “Israel strikes Iran by January 31, 2026?” All have been successful, making further profits of more than $28,000.The Guardian’s analysis of blockchain data traced the wallet to an X account with its location set to Beit Ha’shita, a kibbutz in northern Israel. The user recently transferred their bets to two other accounts, data shows, potentially to avoid detection. There, they currently have 10 live bets relating to Israel’s military strategy.The X user behind the account could not be reached for comment but Israel Defense Forces and the Israel Security Agency have opened an investigation into the user, officialssaidlast Thursday.Chart of bets on the Polymarket for “Yes” odds on “Israel military action against Iran before July?”Unlike sports betting sites like DraftKings, where users have to scan their IDs before they are able to place a bet, Polymarket is built on a blockchain. Accounts are linked to crypto wallets that can be publicly traced but are difficult to link back to an individual. So, even though the company is headquartered in the US, its markets are global and the users anonymous.Online prediction betting markets look ahead after US presidential election triumph: ‘We’re just getting started’Read moreOnline prediction markets found mainstream traction in 2024 by letting everyday Americans wager on the US presidential election.Americans were already becoming hooked on online gambling after the 2018 supreme court ruling that legalized sports betting. But that election supercharged the desire to bet: the twists and turns of the presidential race meant it already felt like a spectator sport.Polymarket’s virality was initially powered by manosphere influencers. The Barstool Sports founder Dave Portnoy broadcast election odds to more than 200 million followers, right-leaning X accounts weaponized the markets, which were predicting a Trump victory, against mainstream polls, which showed a tight race. Crypto streamers pitched political betting as just another high-risk, high-reward trade.Since then, Polymarket and its rival Kalshi have gamified all corners of life – from tomorrow’s weather to Bad Bunny’s Super Bowl outfit – and in effect, turned reality itself into a casino.To bet on an outcome, users buy either a “yes” or “no” event contract. These are priced between $0 and $1, and like any market, their price fluctuates depending on demand. If a “yes” contract is worth $0.80, the market thinks it’s 80% likely. If the “yes” thing happens – a team wins their game, a director wins their Oscar, a bomb drops on a city – the value of the correct contract shoots up to $1, while the wrong contract drops to $0. If you buy thousands of contracts for something that seems really unlikely, $0.10 for Israel striking Iran, say, then when that contract reaches $1 – you stand to make a huge profit.For example, one account created in November has been solely dedicated to wagering that Trump will appoint Kevin Warsh as the next chair of the Federal Reserve, persisting even when the odds dropped to 7%. After Trump announced Warsh this morning, they will profit $142,000.I think [these prediction markets are] affecting us more than we probably realizeYesha YadavPolymarket disciples reject the idea that they are merely gambling, they see the markets that result from the bets placed on the site as critical sources of information. The thinking is that Polymarket odds, based on the guesses of people willing to put their money where their mouth is, are a better method of predicting the future than flawed polls or biased commentators. They see Polymarket, primarily, as journalism.“It’s the most accurate thing we have as mankind right now, until someone else creates some sort of super crystal ball,” Polymarket’s CEO, Shayne Coplan,told60 Minutes in November, shortly after the 28-year-old was anointed the world’s youngest self-made billionaire, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.Polymarket provides a “credible, lightning-fast news channel for hundreds of millions of people”, said the blockchain analyst Andrew 10 Gwei [he goes by his X username], who has been exposing insider activity within crypto startups since 2020 and has more recently turned his focus to Polymarket. “You gain access to critical information about key world events faster than everyone else.”Polymarket called the 2024 presidential race before the polls. The 2026 Golden Globes announced real-time Polymarket odds as the telecast headed into commercials,correctly predicting26 out of 28 winners and taking a lot of the suspense out of the ceremony itself. Media entities such asCNNandthe Wall Street Journalhave partnered with prediction markets and integrated their data into their reporting.But this is not the first time America has used prediction markets to hedge outcomes.A century ago, political betting was rampant on Wall Street. Bookmakers correctly predicted 11 out of 15 elections between 1884 and 1940. These odds would be splashed across newspapers each election cycle – “never wrong”, assome papersput it. During some election years, the betting on political outcomes would exceed trading in stocks and bonds.However, election betting wouldn’t survive the Prohibition era’s moral clampdown on gambling. Critics warned these markets risked election tampering and information withholding. At the same time, the arrival of scientific polling provided an uncontroversial alternative to finding out the mood of the nation. After the success of Gallup in predicting the 1936 election, many newspapers scrubbed Wall Street odds from their pages.Whales, beards, mules and VIPs: the secret world of high-rolling professional gamblingRead moreBut today’s gambling revival looks nothing like the past: betting is now borderless, anonymous and limited only by imagination.“We’re still trying to understand how these markets are going to affect our lives, but honestly, I think they’re affecting us more than we probably realize,” said Yesha Yadav, a professor at Vanderbilt law school. When Yadav asked her students recently if they bet on prediction markets, a sea of hands shot up. “It’s just becoming normal,” she said.Event contracts are considered derivatives, so online prediction markets fall under the jurisdiction of the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), who, under Biden, had fought hard to block them.Election markets are “contrary to the public interest”, Rostin Behnam, former CFTC chair said in 2023, adding that regulating them would be both “impractical” and force the agency to act as “an election cop”.But under Trump, the CFTC has pulled back. It dropped its legal fight to ban Kalshi’s election markets, and permitted Polymarket to operate domestically under its jurisdiction.Business has been booming ever since: the total value of bets bought on the sites in just the month of December surpassed $8.3bn, up 1,300% from February, according to DefiLlama data. That’s about the same asthe monthly sales of Target.Yet, as the list of markets grows longer, so does the number of people sitting on valuable information. Concerns have been mounting about alleged insider trading.The world first caught on to the problem after the US capture of Venezuela’s leader, Nicolás Maduro, in January. Shortly after, reports circulated that a new Polymarket account had profited more than $400,000 by betting Maduro would be ousted by the end of January. The wagers were placed in the days and hours running up to Trump revealing the capture on Truth Social.Yet, the profiteering may run deeper than this. The Guardian identified more than a dozen Polymarket accounts with the hallmarks of possible insider trading: large, accurate bets lodged shortly before the event, with little other activity – and are not hedging their bets across multiple accounts. Collectively, the accounts have profited about $2.17m.The bets that weren’t gamblesThe markets with suspicious activity cross many areas of life, some involve foreign diplomacy, others congressional votes. From big tech announcements to an international award.On 26 December, the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy,postedon X that he and Trump would meet before the new year. A cluster of five new Polymarket users cashed in a collective $154,000 from the statement. The bets on “Will Trump meet with Zelenskyy by December 31?” were lodged within a few hours of one another, all one day before Zelenskyy’s statement.Blockchain data suggests the accounts may be jointly owned. Three of the wallets funding these accounts have transactions between them, and four link to the same Binance wallet. The wallets frequently interact with a Ukrainian-founded cryptocurrency exchange and one features the Ukrainian flag with the bio “#standwithUkraine”.Earlier this month, Ukrainian regulatorsbannedPolymarket for conducting an unlicensed gambling business.Diagram of the relationships between Polymarket accounts that bet on the Trump-Zelensky meetingIn October, Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado Parisca won the Nobel peace prize. Shortly after, major news outlets reported about aspikein Polymarket activity before the announcement, with one user having profited more than $65,000, prompting the Nobel Institute to launch an investigation.But the scale was far bigger than previously reported: the Guardian uncovered eight jointly owned, new accounts which collectively profited more than $161,000, with wagers placed 12 hours before the winner was revealed. Among them are politically charged usernames like “fmaduro”, “madurowilllose”, “trumpdeservesit” and “striketheboats”.One new account made $17,000 betting on the date of the US government shutdown, the bulk of which was made from a bet made the night before the House passed the government funding bill.Another made $25,000 predicting which shows would be Netflix’s first and second most-streamed shows that week – in the US and globally – with correct bets placed in 10 Netflix markets for two weeks in a row.Three have bet exclusively on announcements from Strategy, a publicly traded bitcoin treasury company, profiting more than $143,000 since July.Twelve emerged in October to bet on the launch of OpenAI’s new browser, profiting $50,000, with all but one now lying inactive.Could it be that all of these accounts were just normal users who randomly placed life-changing amounts of money on niche markets, took the profits, and never gambled again? It’s conceivable – but seems almost impossible. The likelihood is that these bets were made by people with prior knowledge of the market’s outcome.The problem is proving it. Because what constitutes insider knowledge is ambiguous.What’s cool about Polymarket is that it creates this financial incentive for people to go and divulge the information to the marketShayne Coplan, Polymarket CEOTake this macabre example: a new Polymarket account made $142,000 betting that Thailand would strike Cambodia just hours before the market resolved. Blockchain data links the wallet to a person based in Thailand. But reports suggest the bets occurred while the strikes had already begun. Seeing missiles, getting evacuated, or hearing local reports first does not make them an insider – they simply had the advantage of circumstance.Whether insider trading should be illegal, even in more traditional markets, was for a long time a matter of debate. Up until the 1930s, this kind of activity was allowed on the stock market; corporate insiders could freely trade on non-public information. But after the 1929 Wall Street crash, in order to keep ordinary Americans trading, Congress needed to convince them the stock market was not a rigged casino. So, in 1934, it outlawed “any manipulative or deceptive device” in connection with trading securities.Regulators and courts have since interpreted that law to include trading on the basis of “material, non-public information”. There’s been thousands of cases over the decades, including a lawyersentencedto 12 years in prison for trading on information stolen from pre-eminent law firms.Kalshi, Polymarket’s main competitor, hasrulesprohibiting insider trading. A spokesperson said they freeze accounts that show suspicious behavior while they investigate trades by analyzing that user’s social connections and have already “disciplined a number of users”. Kalshi says that it is a financial crime for users that have “material, non-public information”, about a market to place a bet on that market.Polymarket is not centrally regulated and does not ban insider trading. Instead, it falls to the users to comply with the law wherever they are based, a spokesperson said.However, after the CFTC allowed Polymarket to operate in the US in November, Polymarket rolled out a regulated, waitlist-only version of its app for US users. This app does require a government-issued ID and prohibits insider trading. It only has a limited selection of markets.But US users only need a VPN to access the unregulated version of the site and it’s presumed millions of Americans have placed hundreds of millions worth of bets in this way. This violates Polymarket’sterms of use, but because Polymarket does not collect customers’ personal information, it can only verify their identity with an IP address, which can easily be altered with a VPN.View image in fullscreenPolymarket’s CEO, Shayne Coplan, at the 2024 Democratic national convention in Chicago, Illinois.Photograph: Matthew Reeves/BFA.com/Shutterstock“Of course there’s people who are working on it that know when it’s going to come. What’s cool about Polymarket is that it creates this financial incentive for people to go and divulge the information to the market and the market to change,” CEO Coplan told 60 Minutes.“Insider trading is a core feature of the system. It’s what makes them the fastest and most accurate news source in the world,” said Andrew 10 Gwei, who has been exposing insider activity within crypto startups since 2020 and has more recently turned his focus to Polymarket. He estimates to have found dozens of these accounts over the past month or two, totalling millions of dollars in profits.X is inundated with self-proclaimed insider-hunters like Andrew who track suspicious activity and use this information to inform their own trades. Andrew lets people know when he thinks he has spotted an insider, so that laypeople can quickly copy their bets.“People are keen to learn how to track insider accounts, or at least get information about them, primarily to find financial opportunities. I doubt anyone following me considers insider trading on Polymarket wrong or harmful,” said Andrew.Rather than insider traders, Andrew likes to describe the people betting on Polymarket with near-certainty as “privileged money flow” – people who possess unique expertise and positioning that allows them to predict the correct outcome of specific events before everyone else.“I see nothing wrong with, say, a meteorologist with 20 years of experience and access to modern equipment earning an extra salary on Polymarket. Because of their position, they can predict weather changes with 99% more accuracy than the rest of the market,” he said.But this mechanism also gives a financial incentive to divulge classified material.“If you know we’re going to bomb Iran in the next week and you start placing bets, then the prediction market tells the Iranians they’re about to get bombed,” said Richard Painter, who was the chief White House ethics lawyer under George W Bush.So, in theory, Maduro could have escaped if he had simply checked Polymarket.“That could be a very, very dangerous thing, because all the countries need to do is look at the prediction markets and try and figure out what the heck we’re going to do,” he said.A Polymarket spokesperson said that the CFTC-regulated version of its app, which requires government-issued ID and prohibits insider trader in compliance with the law, was currently being rolled out for US users. However, the main site – where the markets the Guardianidentified were created – only requires a crypto wallet. While it does not ban insider trading, local laws still apply to the markets, the spokesperson said. Accessing this site via VPN to circumvent geoblocking violated Polymarket’s terms of use, they added.The military mapthat changed to win a betThe claim that insider trading makes markets more honest has a long history in libertarian thought. In 1966, the prominent US legal scholar and economist Henry Manne argued insider trading would make the market more efficient, and letting insiders buy stock before good news goes public could function like a performance bonus.But the law went in the other direction. From the 1960s, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) aggressively expanded insider trading enforcement, warning that it defrauds investors, reduces trust in markets and distorts corporate behavior.The same harms apply to prediction markets, experts warn.Let’s say you bet $50 that Sinnerswill win best picture at the 2026 Oscars. Hamnet takes it. Your losses are used to pay the winning wagers.Except, let’s say one of those winners works at PwC, the consultancy that organizes the voting. Suddenly, it no longer feels like a loss, but a theft.It’s clear that fortune is not evenly distributed on Polymarket. Fewer than 0.04% of Polymarket accounts have profited a collective $3.7bn, capturing more than 70% of total realized profits, data from the blockchain analyst DeFi Oasisshows.On Polymarket, the comment sections beneath markets with sudden, unexpected outcomes are littered with disgruntled users suspecting foul play.If enough traders start to feel the markets are rigged, an “unfairness epidemic” can take hold, said Yadav, meaning less trading volume and less accuracy.But the risks run deeper than investor confidence. In SEC v Texas Gulf Sulphur Co(1968), the court warned that insider trading laws are needed to prevent corporate management from “manipulating the timing and flow of information for personal advantage”.Prediction markets also risk distorting real-world decision making – but with significantly higher stakes.On 7 January, Kalshishoweda 98% probability that White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt’s briefing would exceed 65 minutes. But then, with 30 seconds to go, Leavitt concluded abruptly. Winning traders saw returns of nearly 5,000%.While this may have been coincidence, Painter warned the stakes could get higher, like someone in the Department of Justice recommending a pardon because their friend has a bet on it.“The real damage isn’t the people who were dumb enough to place a bet. The real damage to the public is a government official who makes a decision they otherwise wouldn’t have made,” said Painter. “That could have a cataclysmic effect on our government and the ethics of our government.”When you’re a government insider, the term prediction market is a misnomer, because … you’re the one making the decisionRitchie TorresWe have already seen an example of someone in a position of authority reshaping the world to win a bet.Onemarketspeculated on what date Russia would capture the Ukrainian city of Myrnohrad. It was resolved on 15 November when the live map generated by the Institute for the Study of War (ISW), which Polymarket uses to adjudicate territories, updated to show a Russian advance. Then, moments after the market closed, the map reversed and the advance disappeared. The Guardianidentified three new accounts that made large bets either the night before the map changed, or in the minutes after, profiting $9,300 in total – a return of about 3,500%.The ISW’s “control of terrain” map is used by journalists, governments and analysts to track the frontlines of the Russia-Ukraine war. Manipulating it spreads disinformation about a Russian attack and could interfere with the conflict itself.The ISW shared a statement on its website acknowledging that an “unauthorized and unapproved” edit of its map had taken place, but did not mention betting markets. A spokesperson said the ISW “strenuously objects” to Polymarket using its map, and it disapproves of all betting on the Ukraine war.‘My son was shaking, trying not to go online’: how the gambling industry got its claws into childrenRead moreJust days after the Maduro trade, Representative Ritchie Torres of New York introduced thePublic Integrity in Financial Prediction Markets Actbanning members of Congress, their aides or administration officials from making trades on prediction sites based on “material, non-public information”.“The CFTC’s authority over prediction markets is poorly defined. It’s a gray area. There’s a need for legislative clarity from Congress,” Torres said. With 39 Democratic co-sponsors already, he said he was optimistic about finding a Republican co-lead.Torres considers the bill a “starting point” for a broader regulatory framework for prediction markets, including a ban on insider trading. Outlawing government officials from trading on insider information is most urgent, he said, as bets create a “perverse incentive” to influence political decisions.The bill, however, falls short of a total ban of government officials using prediction markets. That means even if it passes before November’s midterm elections, betting on the results may be fair game.“But you can intentionally lose an election,” Painter points out, who advocates prohibiting officials from these sites altogether.As Torres put it himself: “When you’re a government insider, the term prediction market is a misnomer, because if you’re the one making the decision, or if you’re part of the decision-making process, you’re not predicting anything. You’re governing for profit.”"

The site, where local people dig manually for a few dollars a day, has been under the control of the M23 rebel group since 2024.The collapse occurred on Wednesday and the precise toll was still unclear as of Friday evening.“More than 200 people were victims of this landslide, including miners, children and market women. Some people were rescued just in time and have serious injuries,” Muyisa said.An adviser to the governor said the number of confirmed dead was at least 227. He spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorised to brief the media.The UN says M23 has plundered Rubaya’s riches to help fund its insurgency, backed by the government of neighbouring Rwanda – an allegation Kigali denies.The heavily armed rebels, whose stated aim is to overthrow the government in Kinshasa and ensure the safety of the Congolese Tutsi minority,captured even more mineral-rich territory in eastern Congoduring a lightning advance last year.Explore more on these topicsDemocratic Republic of the CongoAfricaMiningnewsShareReuse this content"

Can a fractured region push back?Read moreThe gunfire and explosions in the airport, which is about 6 miles (10km) from the presidential palace and Base Aérienne 101, a military base previously used byUS and then Russian troops, hit at least three planes: one belonging to Ivorian carrier Air Côte d’Ivoire and two belonging to the Togolese airline Asky. A source at Asky said the airline staff were in their hotel away from the scene and remained in the city, with their passports still in the custody of the authorities.Niger, which has been led by a junta sincethe deposition of the democratically elected Mohamed Bazoum in July 2023, has previously blamed the chaos on its neighbours Benin and Côte d’Ivoire, as well as former colonial ruler France, without presenting any supporting evidence.In a statement aimed at Niger’s neighbours in the regional Economic Community of West African States and its former ally France, the head of the junta, Gen Abdourahmane Tchiani, said on national television on Thursday: “We have heard them bark, they should be ready to hear us roar.”Since the coup, Niger has exited Ecowas, joining ranks with fellow junta-run states Burkina Faso and Malito form the Association of Sahel States (AES), which has issued its own passports and set up a regional development institution, the Confederal Bank for Investment and Development. AES sees some of its Ecowas neighbours as French proxies scheming along with Paris to derail development in the Sahel states as they grapple with jihadist activity.In its statement on Thursday, Nigerien authorities said the attackers arrived on motorcycles, and security forces quickly repelled their advance, killing 20 of the attackers and arresting 11 others. A stash of ammunition also caught fire, the government said.The Niamey attack happened about the same time as an attack using drones by jihadists in neighbouring Nigeria. The attack byIslamic StateWest Africa Province in the early hours of Thursday at the Sabon Gari army base in the north-east state of Borno left at least nine soldiers dead and several others wounded.Explore more on these topicsNigerAfricaIslamic StatenewsShareReuse this content"

However, the casehas since slowedand experts do not expect a judgment before the end of 2027. Israel has rejected accusations of genocide as “outrageous and false”.South Africa and Israel have long been at odds, due to the staunch support of the Palestinian cause by South Africa’s government. Soon after his release from prison in 1990, Nelson Mandelaembraced the Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat. In 1997, Mandela, by then president of South Africa, said: “Our freedom is incomplete without the freedom of the Palestinians.”Many South Africans see strong similarities between apartheid white minority rule and Israel’s grip over the occupied Palestinian territories, a comparison Israel refutes.Israel’s embassy in South Africa has regularly attacked the government on social media. “The South African government has thrown away R100 million [£4.6m] attacking Israel at the ICJ – with another R500 million to be wasted next year. 0% of value for South Africans, 100% political theatre,” itpostedon X in November.Later that month, Ramaphosa said “boycott politics don’t work” in response to Donald Trump’s refusal to attend theG20summitin South Africa. Israel’s embassyposted: “A rare moment of wisdom and diplomatic clarity from President Ramaphosa.”South African officials were angered earlier this week when Israeli diplomats met the Thembu king, Buyelekhaya Dalindyebo, in the Eastern Cape province to discuss Israel providing agriculture, water and health aid, without first informing the government.Dalindyebo is pro-Israel andvisited the countryin December, where he was welcomed by the Israeli foreign minister, Gideon Sa’ar.Eastern Cape’s premier, Lubabalo Oscar Mabuyane, said in astatementthat he “rejects the sinister deal between the king and Israel, and views these actions as an attempt by the Israeli government to undermine the sovereign right of the Republic of South Africa to manage its international affairs.”DIRCO said in its Friday statement: “Such actions represent a gross abuse of diplomatic privilege and a fundamental breach of the Vienna convention.”Israel’s embassy posted videos of Dalindyebo welcoming the offers of aid on X. “These are the videos the South African media didn’t want you to see,” itsaid.Mandela was also part of the Thembu clan, whose historic kingdom is now home tomore than 400,000 people.Explore more on these topicsSouth AfricaIsraelCyril RamaphosaMiddle East and north AfricaAfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Videos filmed by local people showed streaks of light in the sky and the sound of loud explosions, while other images showed flames several metres high and charred cars.On state television, General Abdourahmane Tchiani, who seized power in a 2023 coup, accused the presidents of France, Benin and Côte d’Ivoire of sponsoring the attack, and vowed retaliation.“We have heard them bark, they should be ready to hear us roar,” he said, signalling further worsening of relationship between the Sahel nation and the neighbouring countries he sees as French proxies in the region, and its former colonial power.The offices of the presidents of France, Benin and Côte d’Ivoire could not be immediately reached for comment.Several observers indicated it was probably a jihadist strike. The country isgrappling witharmed groups linked to Islamic State and al-Qaida affiliates who have been launching attacks on the tri-border region with Mali and Burkina Faso in particular.Tiani also thanked the Russian troops stationed at the base for “defending their sector”.Since seizing power, the military rulers in Niamey, like the military rulers in neighbouring Mali and Burkina Faso, have cut ties with western powers and turned to Moscow for military support to tackle the insurgencies.Niger state television reported that one of the several assailants killed was a French national, as footage showed several bloodied bodies on the ground. It provided no evidence.A source with the Togolese airline Asky told the Guardian that gunshots had made several holes in the fuselage of its two planes on the tarmac of Niamey airport. Staff were at their hotel at the time but remained stranded in the country. “They destroyed both aircraft … They left evidence at the scene,” the source said.Yacouba Fofana, a spokesperson for Air Côte d’Ivoire, confirmed that one of the airline’s aircraft had also been hit. “A communique is being prepared [about it],” he said.It remained unclear who had fired the shots or whether there were any casualties. Satellite images published early on Thursday showed areas with signs of scorched earth near the airport’s runway.Authorities in Niger, a junta-run country in west Africa’s Sahel region regularly hit by jihadist violence, have yet to comment on the situation.On Thursday, a heavy security presence blocked the perimeter of the airport and, in particular, access to the military base on the site. But in most parts of Niamey, people were going about their lives normally.“Over the last few days, there have been warnings of an imminent risk of an attack, but it’s not clear if it was going to come from the two main groups active in the country,” Beverly Ochieng, an analyst at the consultancy Control Risks, told AFP. “But they have been building their presence in areas near Niamey.”Ochieng said the incident could align with the wider cause claimed by the al-Qaida-affiliate Jama’at Nusrat ul-Islam wa al-Muslimin (JNIM) “to continue targeting [the] security establishment, high-profile establishment as a way of delegitimising the juntas”.Last weekend, JNIM claimed responsibility for destroying an army vehicle with an improvised explosive device several kilometres east of Niamey.In July 2023, Niger’s presidential guard, led by Tchiani,overthrewthe democratically elected president, Mohamed Bazoum, marking the seventh successful coup in west and central Africa in three years at that point. There has been at least one successful coup and two failed attempts in the region since then.The junta suspended the constitution and faced international condemnation and aid cuts. After the Economic Community of West African States imposed sanctions and threatened military intervention, Niger withdrew from the regional bloc alongside Mali and Burkina Faso – both also under military rule – to form the Alliance of Sahel States (AES) in September 2023. Niger alsoexpelled FrenchandUS forces, signalling a geopolitical realignment away from former traditional allies.The security situation hasdeteriorated significantlysince the coup despite the junta’s promises to restore stability.The Global Terrorism Index 2025 reports that Niger recorded the largest increase in terrorism deaths globally in 2024, rising by 94% to a total of 930 deaths, the country’s worst ranking since the index began.Agence France-Presse contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsNigerAir transportAfricanewsShareReuse this content"

While the statement did not name Mexico, Sheinbaum’s government has been thetop supplier of oilto the island since 2025, surpassing Russia and Venezuela.Trump threatens tariffs on goods from countries that sell oil to CubaRead moreSheinbaum said on Friday that her government would seek more information about the tariffs from the US state department, while looking for alternative ways to provide humanitarian aid to the Cuban people.“We will seek a way, without puttingMexicoat risk, of course, but always seeking solidarity with the Cuban people,” she told reporters.The new tariff policy comes as Cuba struggles with increasingly severe blackouts. Sheinbaum said the tariffs could “directly affect hospitals, food supplies and other basic services for the Cuban people”.Cuba’s president, Miguel Díaz-Canel Bermúdez, said ina post on Xthat Trump sought to “suffocate” the island’s economy and that the tariffs revealed the “fascist, criminal, and genocidal nature of a clique that has hijacked the interests of the American people for purely personal gain”.View image in fullscreenClaudia Sheinbaum speaks in Mexico City on 29 January 2026.Photograph: Carlos Santiago/Eyepix Group/ShutterstockCuba’s situation has become even more precarious since the US captured and transported Nicolás Maduro, a key ally of the government in Havana, from Venezuela at the start of the year.A week later, Trump wrote in a Truth Social post: “THERE WILL BE NO MORE OIL OR MONEY GOING TO CUBA – ZERO!”On Thursday, the Financial Timesreported an estimatethat Cuba only has enough oil to last 15 to 20 days at current levels of demand and domestic production, and could soon face sharp rationing.Sheinbaum’s comments came after a week of increasing threats from Washington. US officials briefed that gunboats could be deployed off Cuba, and said efforts were under way to find Cuban ministers prepared to collaborate with the US.Speaking on Wednesday, Mike Hammer, the US chargé d’affaires in Havana, said: “The Cubans have complained for years about a ‘blockade’, but now there is going to be a real blockade.”The issue of oil shipments to Cuba is a fraught one for Sheinbaum, who is striving to show theTrump administrationthat Mexico is a partner on trade and security without alienating the left wing of her party, Morena.TheTrump administrationhas recently repeated its threats of unilateral military strikes on drug-trafficking cartels in Mexico, just as the two countries begin to renegotiate the trillion-dollar USMCA North American free trade agreement.In Havana, 12-hour daily blackouts have become commonplace. Many Cuban families are struggling to cook food, finding it hard to get hold of gas canisters, and are resorting to cooking over charcoal.But Jorge Piñon, an expert on Cuba’s energy at the University of Texas, said the situation has the potential to grow even more severe.“If we do not see any crude oil or fuel deliveries within the next six to eight weeks, then the government will have a major crisis on their hands,” he said.Explore more on these topicsCubaMexicoClaudia SheinbaumDonald TrumpOilTrump administrationUS foreign policynewsShareReuse this content"

Panama was Marco Rubio’s first overseas stop as US secretary of state.Despite the insistence by Panama’s government and the canal authority thatChinahad no influence, Rubio made clear that Washington viewed the operation of the ports as a national security issue.

It said the Panamanian government should respect the spirit of contracts and provide a fair business environment.“Given the current situation in Panama, Hong Kong enterprises should carefully review their existing and future investments there,” it said.In Beijing, China’s foreign ministry spokesperson, Guo Jiakun, told reporters that China would take all necessary measures to safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of “the Chinese company”, without elaborating on the potential steps.Explore more on these topicsPanama canalPanamaTrump administrationMarco RubioChinaHong KongAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

We are talking about the country that we are going to give to our children,” said Delcy Rodríguez, the acting president, whosignedthe law shortly after its approval by congress.The congressional leader, Jorge Rodríguez – who is the acting president’s brother – celebrated the law’s approval. “I congratulate the people of Venezuela. Only good things will come after the suffering. These are the good things, for everyone, that we must build together, regardless of how we each conceive the prosperity of our republic,” he said.Earlier on Thursday, Delcy Rodríguez held a phone call with Donald Trump, whodisclosedthe conversation during his cabinet’s first meeting of the year. Trump said he was about to “open up all commercial airspace over Venezuela”. Since the US president, while ramping up pressure on the dictator Nicolás Maduro, declared Venezuela’s airspace “closed in its entirety”, at least eight international airlines have suspended operations in the South American country.View image in fullscreenDelcy Rodríguez holds up the new legislation at a rally in Caracas on Thursday alongside her brother and congressional leader, Jorge Rodríguez(left).Photograph: Maxwell Briceno/ReutersTrump said big US oil companies were already on the ground in Venezuela carrying out site assessments for potential operations. He said they were “scouting it out and picking their locations, and they’ll be bringing back tremendous wealth for Venezuela and for the United States”.Can Venezuela’s Delcy Rodríguez become a Latin American Deng Xiaoping?Read moreThe Trump administration also eased some sanctions on Venezuela’s oil industry. The US Treasury issued a general licence authorising transactions involving the Venezuelan regime and the state-owned Petróleos de Venezuela (PDVSA).Since the naval blockade to halt oil shipments on sanctioned vessels and the 3 January military operation thatcaptured Madurowhile leaving his entire cabinet in power, the US has taken control of Venezuela’s oil exports and revenues, which the White House has said it intends to retain indefinitely to ensure the regime follows its foreign policy objectives.The US-supported changes to the hydrocarbons law were approved at first reading last week and underwent a fast-tracked “public consultation” process before being unanimously approved at the second and final reading on Thursday by the regime-loyal National Assembly.The new law stipulates that even when they are minority partners in joint ventures with PDVSA, private companies may exercise “technical and operational management” directly, breaking with the previous rule that required state control over operational decisions. It also provides for a possible reduction in royalty payments to the regime from 30% to zero.David Vera, an associate dean in the Craig School of Business in the US, said the new law “was necessary, and overall a positive step. But it still falls short of what US oil companies need to commit capital at scale. Yes, there’s more flexibility on royalties, taxes, arbitration, and commercialisation, but a lot of executive discretion and legal uncertainty remains.”According to José Ignacio Hernández, a legal scholar and researcher of Venezuela’s oil industry who works with the consultancy Aurora Macro Strategies, the new law “improves some aspects of the previous draft by granting greater contractual stability to private investment”, but it “fails to address all the causes that led to the collapse of the oil sector”.Venezuela holds the world’s largest proved oil reserves but accounts for less than 1% of global production.The country was once the world’s largest exporter after emerging as a significant oil producer in the 1920s. Production was nationalised in the 1970s with the creation of PDVSA, which came under Hugo Chávez’s control in the 2000s, when Maduro’s mentor and predecessor dismissed most of its leadership and technical staff.After an initial boom under Chávez, production collapsed after years of mismanagement and corruption, compounded by US sanctions, falling from 3.4m barrels a day to about 1m.“The most troubling aspect of the new law is the lack of consultation and political dialogue,” said Hernández, noting that despite regime claims that more than 120 proposals were received during this week’s fast-tracked process, there was no meaningful public debate.Gonzalo Escribano, who heads the energy and climate programme at the Elcano Royal Institute in Spain, said Venezuela’s oil market would only become genuinely attractive to foreign investment after a democratic transition – something for which the US has yet to set a timetable.“A transition to democracy is needed so that there is a legitimate government and all decisions taken and laws approved have a legitimate constitutional backing and cannot simply be reversed,” said Escribano.Hernández said: “It will be, I fear, a short-lived law.”Explore more on these topicsVenezuelaDelcy RodríguezOilCommoditiesAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

Millions were told to stay at home, and at one point there were more than a million people without power. As of Wednesday night, there were still 312,000 outages, mostly across Tennessee, Mississippi, Louisiana and Texas.This winter storm then spread into easternCanada, with Toronto’s Pearson airport setting a record for the most snow to fall in one day at that location, with 46cm (18.1in). Downtown Toronto recorded even more, with 56cm of snow recorded on Sunday.Further winter storm watches and warnings have been issued across parts of the US for later this week. For parts of the mid-Atlantic, heavy snow could bring about 10-20cm of accumulations between Friday afternoon and Sunday afternoon, with North Carolina, east Tennessee, upstate South Carolina, Virginia and north-east Georgia most at risk.Parts of central and northernPortugalwere affected by Storm Kirstin earlier this week, with heavy rain and strong winds causing more than 3,000 weather-related incidents and five deaths.A peak wind gust of 110mph (178km/h) was recorded at Monte Real airbase in Leiria, with flooding, landslides and widespread damage reported. Ten coastal areas were placed under a red weather warning on Wednesday due to dangerous sea conditions, with waves expected to reach up to 14 metres.View image in fullscreenA group of young people leap from St Kilda Pier in Melbourne.Photograph: Michael Currie/AAPExtreme heat across south-eastern Australia has been breaking records this week.

The Bureau of Meteorology warned of “extreme fire dangers” as the hot and dry conditions combine with strong winds.

The White House has yet to specify tariff rates for violating its new policy of blockingCubafrom buying oil.AWhite House statementcited Cuba’s ties to hostile powers to explain the new tariff policy, citing the Cuban government’s alleged ties to Russia, Hamas and Hezbollah.“These actions constitute an unusual and extraordinary threat to US national security and foreign policy, requiring immediate response to protect American citizens and interests,” the White House said.Cuba is an import-dependent Caribbean island nation ofabout 8 million inhabitantswhose $85bn GDP is similar to that of Rhode Island. The Communist party of Cuba has ruled the country for six decades.The Trump administration had pressured other countries to stop providing oil to Cuba in the lead-up to Thursday’s tariff announcement. Trump has tussled with Mexico’sClaudia Sheinbaumfor weeks over the issue.Sheinbaum has insisted that Mexico’s state oil company, Pemex, will continue to fill contractual obligations with Havana and may offer oil for humanitarian reasons.“The humanitarian aid will continue, as it does to other countries,”Sheinbaum saidat a press conference earlier this week. “Mexico has always shown solidarity with the entire world. They are sovereign decisions.”Still, Sheinbaumacknowledged earlier this weekthat Mexican oil shipments had paused for the moment.Mexico’s president says cancellation of oil shipment to Cuba is ‘sovereign’ decisionRead moreMexico has been a major oil supplier for Cuba, providing 20,000 barrels a day through most of last year, according to NPR. That figure amounts to a little less than a third of the 70,000 daily barrels that Venezuela provided last year,according to the Miami Herald. Cuba reportedly resold much of its Venezuelan oil supply, however.Cuba is facing major economic pressure since US forces arrested the Venezuelan leaderNicolás Maduroand his wife in a surprise attack and whisked them to New York to face federal drug-trafficking charges. Under US pressure, Cuba lost access to Venezuelan oil, its principal supplier.The US secretary of state,Marco Rubio, is the son of Cubans who emigrated from the island to Miami before the Cuban revolution that broughtFidel Castroto power in 1959 and a fierce opponent of the regime he founded.Cuba had already rationed gasoline and imposed limited daily electricity blackouts as it struggled with limited oil supplies. The island only has15 to 20 days’ worth of oilin inventory, according to a report from the Financial Times.Tourist visits haveplummetedin the face of the economic turmoil and Trump’s open efforts to topple the communist government.“Cuba will be failing pretty soon,” Trump told reporters earlier this week, adding: “They got their money fromVenezuela.

He said: “I know that the action taken in relation to our parliamentarians has been a real cause of concern, understandably so.“And therefore I raised that issue whilst I was here, and the Chinese are absolutely clear in response: the restrictions no longer apply. President Xi said to me that that means all parliamentarians are welcome.“I think that shows that if you engage, you can raise the difficult issues, the issues that my parliamentary colleagues would have expected me to raise, and therefore I can be clear, the restrictions no longer apply.”The affected MPs and peers said they would not stop speaking out against human rights abuses, including the targeting of the minority Uyghur Muslim community in Xinjiang province.They also said the “selective lifting of sanctions solely on sitting parliamentarians is wrong”. An academic, a barrister and a former Tory MP who were also sanctioned appear to remain subject to the measures, possibly including their families.Starmeropened the door to a UK visitfrom Xi after the talks in Beijing on Thursday. However, it would have been politically challenging to do so while the sanctions remained in place. Chinese diplomats are banned from parliament after a spying row.Starmer suggested on Friday that Xi would be welcome in the UK when it hosted the G20 summit next year. “We are hosting the G20 in 2027. China is a G20 country. So of course I’d like to see President Xi come around the G20.”The prime minister was forced to downplay comments made overnight by Donald Trump about the supposed perils of dealing with Beijing. The US president is due to visit China himself in April.Asked about Starmer’s visit, Trump told reporters: “Well, it’s very dangerous for them to do that, and it’s even more dangerous, I think, for Canada to get into business with China.” Last week, Trumpthreatened to level tariffs on Canadaif it made a trade deal with China.Asked about Trump’s view, Starmer told Sky News from Shanghai: “I’ve seen President Trump’s comments. I think, to be fair, he was probably talking more about Canada than the United Kingdom.”China’s sanctions on the British citizens were a retaliationagainst theUK imposing sanctions on Chinese officialsheld responsible for atrocities in Xinjiang. It is understood that those will not be lifted in return.The five MPs put under sanctions in 2021 were the former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith, Tom Tugendhat, Nusrat Ghani, Neil O’Brien and Tim Loughton, who stood down in 2024.The two peers were David Alton, a crossbencher, and Helena Kennedy, from Labour. Several are members of the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China.Before the move was confirmed, the seven parliamentarians issued a statement. “We would rather remain under sanction indefinitely than have our status used as a bargaining chip to justify lifting British sanctions on those officials responsible for the genocide in Xinjiang,” they said.“We would reject any deal that prioritises our personal convenience over the pursuit of justice for the Uyghur people. We stand in total solidarity with our families, former colleagues, and the civil society organisations who remain targeted by the People’s Republic of China.”The Newcastle University academic Dr Jo Smith Finley, whose research focuses on theUyghurs, and Geoffrey Nice KC, who chaired the Uyghur tribunal that investigated atrocities against the minority group, remain under sanctions.All nine were banned from entering China, Hong Kong and Macau, any property they had in China was frozen, and Chinese citizens and institutions were prohibited from doing business with them.The direct impact of the sanctions on the parliamentarians was limited, although there have been suggestions they may have faced intimidation and espionage. The symbolism, however, was significant as relations between China and the UK were at a low ebb.In April, China lifted its sanctions on five MEPs and on the European parliament’s subcommittee on human rights, which were also imposed in 2021 in response to the EU’s own sanctions.The move was part of Beijing’s charm offensive to improve ties andrevive talks over a trade deal with Brussels, amid the turmoil caused by Trump’s tariffs.Explore more on these topicsChinaForeign policyConservativesHouse of LordsUyghursKeir StarmerAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

One official said the US had been aware of the trip and the UK’s objectives in advance.Asked about Trump’s remarks, Starmer told Sky News: “I don’t think it’s wise for the United Kingdom to stick its head in the sand. China is the second biggest economy in the world. It’s along with Hong Kong, our third biggest trading partner. And through this visit, we’ve opened up lots of opportunities for jobs and wealth creation back in the United Kingdom.”Asked by BBC Breakfast if the US president was wrong in his remarks, the trade minister, Chris Bryant, said: “Yes, he is wrong, and I say this precisely because, apart from anything else, he himself said in his own statement that he is a friend with President Xi, and as I understand it, President Trump is going to China himself in April.”After his talks with the Chinese president at the Great Hall of the People on Thursday, Starmer said the UK’s relationship with China was in a “good, strong place” and that his meetings had provided “just the level of engagement that we hoped for”.“We warmly engaged and made some real progress, actually, because the UK has got a huge amount to offer,” he told a meeting of the UK-China Business Forum at the Bank of China in Beijing.The chair of the British Chamber of Commerce in China, Chris Torrens, said Starmer’s visit to Beijing was “successful”, telling the BBC: “It makes sense for UK to be looking to China, it’s one of its larger trading partners.”The UK prime minister later travelled to Shanghai before leaving for Tokyo to meet his Japanese counterpart, Sanae Takaichi, for a working dinner.View image in fullscreenStarmer visits Yuyuan Garden in Shanghai on Friday, where he joined students inside a tea house.Photograph: Simon Dawson/No 10 Downing StreetHe is just the latest western leader to have visited Beijing in recent weeks looking to build ties with the world’s second largest economy, and to hedge against an unpredictable US president.It comes amid Trump’s on-off threats of trade tariffs and pledges tograb control of Greenland, an autonomous territory of Denmark, which have rattled longstanding US allies including the UK.Earlier this week, Trump threatened to impose tariffs on Canada if it went through with economic deals struck with China on arecent visit to Beijingby its prime minister, Mark Carney.After commenting on the UK’s engagement with Beijing, Trump said it was “even more dangerous, I think, for Canada. Canada is not doing well. They’re doing very poorly, and you can’t look at China as the answer”.However, the US president, whose country is China’s biggest single trading partner, added: “President Xi is a friend of mine, I know him very well.”Before his trip to Beijing, Starmer said in an interview with Bloomberg that Britain would not have to choose between the US and China, saying the country could strengthen economic ties with Beijing without angering Trump or harming relations with Washington.“We’ve got very close relations with the US – of course, we want to – and we will maintain that business, alongside security and defence,” he said.Before Trump’s comments, the US commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick, said it was unlikely that Starmer’s efforts with China would pay off.“The Chinese are the greatest exporters and they are very, very difficult when you’re trying to export to them,” he told reporters. “So good luck if the British are trying to export to China … it’s just unlikely.”He played down the prospect of Trump threatening Britain with tariffs as he did Canada, adding: “Unless the prime minister of Britain sort of takes on the United States and says very difficult things, I doubt it.”Explore more on these topicsChinaDonald TrumpKeir StarmerAsia PacificGlobal economyXi JinpingTariffsnewsShareReuse this content"

Palau’s lower house now has to consider the deal, and the final decision rests with Whipps Jr.The arrangement is part of a broader assistance package to Palau, including $2m for security initiatives and $7.5m tied to the resettlement of the third-country nationals.But in January, Palau’s senate voted to block the resettlement deal and propose a public referendum on the issue. Palauans would be asked whether their country should accept non-Palauan individuals who have been removed from the US.The referendum would be non-binding but lawmakers said it would “serve as guidance to the national government in determining whether to accept any individuals” under the US deal.Tiny Pacific nation of Palau to take migrants from US in return for aidRead moreIn a written statement to the Guardian, Whipps Jr said the deal with the US will offer “a lawful, humane solution that respects our people, our laws, and our limited capacity as a small island nation”.Still, the deal to resettle US deportees to Palau has drawn sharp opposition from the country’s traditional leaders and lawmakers sincethe Trump administration approachedPalau in July 2025.In letters to the president, the Council of Chiefs – an influential group which brings together Palau’s 16 tribal chiefs – said the country was “not ready, willing, and prepared to venture into this new area of responsibility”. It warned that allowing deportees into Palau risked undermining the country’s social cohesion and cultural values.“We were taken by surprise when a signed MOU [memorandum of understanding] between our government and the US embassy was brought to our attention very recently,” the Council of Chiefs said in a letter to Whipps Jr in January.In its bill blocking the US deal, Palau’s senators said the country, which is not a signatory to the 1951 UN Refugee Convention, “is not suited to serve as a country of deportation, relocation or resettlement” because of its “geographic size, infrastructure and resource constraints”.Whipps Jr said Palau will “review each individual on a case‑by‑case basis and will decide who may come here”.“We are particularly focused on individuals whose skills and professions can help fill genuine gaps in our workforce and contribute positively to our communities.”Senator Rukebai Inabo was one of just three lawmakers who supported the US deal. Inabo believes the agreement to accept US deportees should go ahead. She said it was “mutually beneficial” for Palau and the US, while also providing support to the deportees who had few other options.“If they have not complied with US laws on immigration, what choice do they have?” she said. “Coming to Palau is good for them because it’s a free country, it’s very peaceful here, and life here is simple and not as expensive.”Inabo said she supported a referendum as a means to gauge public opinion on the issue.The agreement with Palau is part of the Trump administration’s broader push to remove migrants from the US by transferring them to third countries, including South Sudan and Eswatini – a policy that has been criticised by migration lawyers and human rights groups.Explore more on these topicsPalauPacific islandsAsia PacificUS foreign policynewsShareReuse this content"

I’m there to protect them from sanctions. It would be wrong to let Xi into their workplace while these sanctions are in place,” he said.Xi didn’t really see a point to Kier’s visit – but hey, let a hundred flowers bloom | John CraceRead moreBefore their talks in the Great Hall of the People, Starmer told Xi he wanted a “broader, deeper and more sophisticated” relationship between the two countries.“It is with the British people in mind that I am here today. I made the promise 18 months ago when we were elected into government that I would make Britain face outwards again.“Because as we all know, events abroad affect everything that happens back in our home countries, from prices on the supermarket shelves to how secure we feel.”The Chinese leader said a closer relationship was “imperative” for world peace, after it had gone through “twists and turns” over the years, arguing that a more “consistent” approach was in both their interests.Xi said the two men would “stand the test of history” if they could “rise above differences”. He appeared to reprimand the Conservative leader, Kemi Badenoch, for her criticism of Starmer’s visit.View image in fullscreenStarmer shakes hands with Xi before their bilateral meeting in Beijing.Photograph: Carl Court/Reuters“Your visit this time has drawn a lot of attention,” he told the prime minister. “Sometimes good things take time. As long as it is the right thing that serves the fundamental interests of the country and the people, then as leaders we should not shy away from difficulties and we should press ahead.“As long as we take a broad perspective, rise above differences and respect each other, then we will prove ourselves able to stand the test of history,” he added.Starmer had begun the trip by saying he wanted to bring “stability and clarity” to the bilateral relationship after years of “inconsistency” under the Tories.After the talks, he said he had “respectfully” raised human rights abuses including the detention of Jimmy Lai, a pro-democracy activist who isfacing life in prison in Hong Kong, and the persecution of the Uyghurs.In a significant move, China agreed to a visa waiver for British tourists and business travellers, ending the requirement for travel to be no more than 30 days and bringing the UK into line with 50 other countries.The UK also signed a number of agreements on closer economic cooperation, including greater trade and services, making it easier for British firms to operate there. They included a £10.8bn investment by the pharmaceutical firm AstraZeneca in its Chinese operation.Beijing also agreed to halve its tariff on Scotch whisky imports from 10% to 5%, estimated to benefit the industry by £250m over five years. It is Scotland’s 10th largest whisky market.The two leaders also discussed the Ukraine war, but Downing Street refused to say whether Starmer – who had spoken to the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, on the eve of the visit – had pressed China to restrain Russia.Explore more on these topicsKeir StarmerForeign policyXi JinpingChinaAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

They said the unit had been “invaluable” to the sector and critical for information sharing between agencies, and ensuring safe and timely responses to DFV-related concerns.Workers said they were concerned about the effect on victim safety, particularly to women in regional and remote areas.“Why would QPS reduce such an important DFV resource, in the current climate of community anger at escalating rates of DFV and resulting community harm?” one frontline worker said.Guardian Australia’sBroken Trust series, published last year, raised concern about policing failures and attitudes in domestic violence cases.47:41Broken trust: how police failed Hannah Clarke and other women they were supposed to protect – videoThe QPS points to the 2022 inquiry into cultural issues in the service, and says subsequent reforms had “addressed many of the issues that previously required centralised oversight”. Several of the recommendations of the review have yet to be implemented and are long overdue, including the establishment of a civilian-led police integrity unit.The inquiry found that attitudes of misogyny, sexism and racism within the QPS were “largely unchecked” and that it was hardly surprising that the same attitudes were then reflected in the way officers responded to victim survivors.The 100-day review found that the “perceived primacy” of family violence meant it took up a large amount of police workload.In response to questions, the QPS confirmed it would cease to operate the DFV operational support unit and that positions within the broader DFV and vulnerable persons command would be sent to frontline commands.Broken trust: why police are failing to learn from their own mistakes - podcastRead moreIt said the 100-day review was an “evidence based roadmap” to strengthen frontline parts of the QPS “and build a more responsive policing organisation”.“As part of this broader reform process, the QPS is realigning components of the DFV and vulnerable persons command into other areas of the organisation.“This realignment is designed to enhance both the strategic and operational response to domestic and family violence by ensuring resources and expertise are positioned where they can have the greatest impact.”The QPS said that its own review found that process improvements since the inquiry had “addressed many of the issues that previously required centralised oversight”.In Australia, the crisis support serviceLifelineis on 13 11 14 and the nationalfamily violence counselling serviceis on 1800 737 732.

Days spent at the beach, sunburn and mosquitoes are part of the national psyche, along with outback pubs serving crisp lager as relief from searing afternoon heat.But when the opal mining town of Andamooka (population 262) in the far north of South Australia reached 50 degrees on Thursday, it was only the eighth time in recorded history anywhere in Australia.It was also the highest temperature recorded so far in what meteorologists have dubbed a “dome of heat” that began with exceptional temperatures in the west and moved into south-eastern Australia, where it still lingers. With no cold front to clear it out, the heat had“nowhere to go”– trapped by a blocking high in the Tasman and remnants of ex-tropical cyclone Luana in Western Australia.It’s difficult to compare one heatwave with another – this one came hot on the heels of one earlier in January, which scientists say was madefive times more likelyby global heating. During that event the fires that ignited across Victoria burnt 435,000 hectares of land (1.1m acres), and killed thousands of flying foxes in theworst mass fauna mortalityevent since the Black Summer of 2019–20.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailBut Bureau of Meteorology senior climatologist Dr Simon Grainger says the latest heatwave is worse. For south-east Australia, it is among “the most significant we’ve ever seen”, he says, for its intensity, duration, temperatures and for the length of time the heat has remained above certain thresholds – comparable to January 2009 and January 1939.Smothering, bullying, stabbing: how it feels to be in one of the hottest places on EarthRead moreTemperature records tumbleAbout 50 weather stations – mostly scattered across western New South Wales, western Victoria and eastern South Australia – have recorded their highest temperatures, Grainger says.Victoria set a state all-time record of 48.9C on Tuesday in the Mallee towns of Hopetoun and Walpeup. On the same day, just over the border, the village of Pooncarie hit 49.7C, equalling the second highest temperature recorded in NSW.Ski fields hotter than 30CIn Australia’s alps, where an average January day might be expected to reach 18C, temperatures climbed above 30C for the first time.On 28 January, the ski town of Falls Creek recorded 30.5C, and Perisher Valley in NSW reached 30.8C – records for both places. “Those are pretty remarkable temperatures,” Grainger says.In comparison, on the same day, Melbourne was 23.6C, and Sydney 28.5C, he says. “We were seeing higher temperatures 1,700 metres above sea level than we were [experiencing] down in Melbourne and Sydney at sea level.”View image in fullscreenIt’s one way to cool down:  South Australians took to the coast for some respite.Photograph: Amer Ghazzal/ShutterstockHot summer nights hard to bearNot surprisingly, during such events, the spotlight falls on record breaking heat recorded during the day. But overnight temperatures can be even more damaging.On Monday in Adelaide, people craving relief after the mercury hit 44.7C – the city’s hottest day since 2019 – had to sweat through their hottest night since records began, with temperatures dipping to only 34.1C – about 18C above average – before quickly rising back above 40.Dozens of inland towns and cities across South Australia, Victoria and NSW have faced five days or more above 40C. In some places, such as Albury in NSW, the heat might last for a week.Graeme McCrabb, from the western NSW town of Menindee where temperatures reached 49.1C on Tuesday, says the heat left everyoneducking for cover. “They get off the streets, get inside and in front of air con.”Towns including Maree in South Australia, and Wilcannia and White cliffs in NSW, sweated through three consecutive days of at least 48C, Grainger says. “For New South Wales, that’s never been seen before.”Such prolonged heat “becomes really hard to bear, because people’s reserves just get worn down,” says A/ Prof Mark Putland, the director of emergency medicine at Royal Melbourne hospital.“People’s houses just heat up. It gets difficult when it doesn’t cool down at night and people don’t get any relief.”View image in fullscreenBushfires continue across Victoria as the state experiences some of its hottest weather on record.Photograph: Michael Currie/EPAHospital admissions soarExtreme heatis themost common causeof weather-related hospitalisations in Australia, killing more people than all other natural hazards combined. Stifling conditions, and sleep-less nights can be a deadly combination.“Even while you’re asleep, extreme overnight heat can be dangerous,” warns Dr Caroline McElnay, Victoria’s chief health officer. “When temperatures stay high overnight, your body can struggle to cool down, increasing the risk of heat stress or more dangerous heatstroke.”It’s still too early to know the full extent of the health affects, but heat-related admissions to emergency departments in Adelaide have tripled compared with January 2025, based on preliminary data.In Melbourne, authorities issuedair quality alertswarning people to stay indoors after smoke from fires burning in the Otways had drifted into the city.Play continues at the tennisAmid dire forecasts and heat health warnings, some of the country’s biggest sporting events carried on.The Australian Open tennis went ahead, despite raised eyebrows, under extreme heat protocols. On the worst days, play on the outer courts was suspended andthousands of fans stayed away, which could cost the tournament an estimated $1m in lower-than-expected ticket, food and beverage revenue. Some are wondering how long it can remain feasible to hold the event outdoors in January as global heating continues to intensify.Other events have made more substantial changes. TheTour Down Undercycling had been scheduled to traverse its most demanding stage at Willunga Hill, south of Adelaide, as the city was forecast to hit 42C, but theextreme heat and firesprompted organisers to make a last minute change to the route.Meteorologists expect the heatwave to finally clear the country on Sunday, just as a new month begins. But hotter-than-average days and nights are likely to continue into autumn, according to the latest long-range forecast.With additional reporting by Melissa Davey and Lisa CoxExplore more on these topicsEnvironmentAustralian climate and environment in focusClimate crisisExtreme heatExtreme weathernewsShareReuse this content"

The grid is now operating in a way that many people considered unimaginable, and maybe impossible, not that long ago.Back then, some commentators claimed the grid would not be able to function with more than 10% – and definitely not more than 20% – electricity coming from solar and wind.Those predictions look foolish now.‘Air conditioners are struggling’: parts of NSW, Queensland and Victoria swelter as heat records tumbleRead moreOver the past seven days, solar provided 30% of all electricity in the country’s main grid, which supplies the five eastern states and the ACT. That’s across day and night.If you narrow the calculation to consider just when the sun is out, the numbers are even more striking. Solar met 59% of electricity demand between 9am and 6pm. More than half of this – 37.6% of the total – was from small-scale systems spread across about 4m roofs. The rest was from large-scale solar farms.Dylan McConnell, a senior research associate at the University of New South Wales, says between 12pm and 1pm solar output peaked at 67% of consumption. It was more than 70% in New South Wales and South Australia.Coal-fired power, the historic backbone of the grid that once supplied nearly 90% of power, could not compete. Solar energy is incredibly cheap. It costs much more to burn coal. It meant the country’s ageing coal fleet was reduced to filling in gaps, kicking in barely a quarter of the electricity used over lunchtime.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailThat changed as the sun set, when the grid leant much more heavily on coal, with notable support from wind, hydro and batteries and gas.The system still needs the existing dirty and often inefficient power plants that burn black and brown coal and emit significant amounts of climate pollution to function. There are significant challenges that need to be overcome before all coal plants can be shut, including building a fleet ofsynchronous condensers and other spinning devicesneeded to maintain grid security.But an often overlooked point is that the grid is now just as reliant on renewable energy as it is coal. Each provides nearly half of the electricity that keeps our homes, businesses and, increasingly, cars running across the year.In parts of the year, renewables are now ahead. The AustralianEnergyMarket Operator this week described the last three months of 2025 as a “landmark moment”, with renewables’ share in the quarter rising beyond 50% for the first time.View image in fullscreenThe sun rises over wind turbines at the Capital Wind Farm, east of Canberra.Photograph: SUPPLIED/AAPIt coincided with a 44% fall in wholesale electricity prices compared with the same period in 2024. Just as notably, output from batteries – which will be needed on a far greater scale as coal shuts – tripled in just a year.It’s worth remembering how quickly this has changed. Five years ago renewables provided about 26% of generation. A decade ago it was less than 15%, with solar on less than 2%.McConnell says one of the most remarkable things this week was how well the system coped as temperatures in parts of Melbourne pushed north of 45C and demand for electricity skyrocketed as people ran air conditioners at full bore. These sorts of conditions are often a cue for warnings of blackouts or load shedding.Not this time.“We had a little bit of volatility in the evening, but not much. That’s quite extraordinary for a system during peak demand,” McConnell says. “They are the days when the system is under stress. Things could have gone wrong, but they didn’t. There were really very few issues.”That syncon feeling: the 150 tonnes of spinning steel that could help stabilise Australia’s energy transitionRead moreAustralia is in a slightly strange moment on renewable energy. From one perspective, it is embracing renewables, and solar in particular, what by any measure is a historic pace. From another, investment in new developments may not be happening fast enough to meet climate targets, or to ensure there is enough replacement capacity in place as old and failing coal plants close.The reality is that both are true.The transition being attempted is huge, more needs to be done, and there may be difficult moments ahead during a rapid shift to a near 100% renewable grid. Some actors –the Queensland LNP government, for example– are doing their best to prevent it.But change is happening, and working.

A cat and two dogs were also found dead at the double-storey house.“Although this investigation is in its infancy, police are investigating this matter as a murder-suicide,” homicide detective Jessica Securo said.“It is believed these persons are known to each other and are part of the family unit.”View image in fullscreenWA police’s Jessica Securo described the suspected murder-suicide in Mosman Park as a ‘confronting’ and ‘highly distressing’ scene.Photograph: AAPSecuro said it did not appear to be a “violent incident”, saying no weapon appeared to have been used.“The family have no reported family violence matters with police,” Securo said.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailSecuro added that both children had “significant health challenges” and had been in contact with care services. She declined to comment further about these health concerns for privacy reasons.At least one of the boys attended Christ Church grammar school, one of Perth’s top private boys’ schools.Securo said the deaths were being treated as a murder-suicide because a note had been found at the house.“Yes, there was a note left at the premises although I’m not about to go into the content of that letter, it will form part of our investigation,” she said.Mosman ParkPolice will investigate whether the health challenges faced by the children were a factor in their murders.“That will form part of our investigation. We will look at this holistically to see what led to this incident and go from there,” Securo said.View image in fullscreenPolice forensic crews at the scene in Mosman Park.Photograph: Justin Benson-Cooper/AAPPolice were piecing together the timeline of events, she said. The family was found after a person arrived at the home for an appointment on Friday morning, but it was unclear when the family members were last seen alive.“What will form part of our investigation is – did this incident happen this morning? Did it happen last night? How long have those persons been in that house?”Securo said the bodies of the family members were not found together, but all of them were inside the property.“I can’t go into those details as to their exact location. However, I will say that they weren’t in the same location,” she said.Late into the afternoon, police remained at the scene moving between the house and a large forensic tent positioned on the front driveway.With the small cul-de-sac closed off to the public, residents gathered on footpaths nearby.The multimillion-dollar home sits in Perth’s golden triangle, between the beach and the river, on a quiet, dead-end street that is close to some of the city’s most elite schools.A neighbour, who did not want to be named, said he would often see support services attending the house.“It is a very, very sad thing, but in this case, you know the two teenagers there were non-verbal,” he said.He described how he would walk his dogs past the property and often see the boys in the swimming pool out the front of their house and he would wave to them as he passed.Nearby resident Henry Oroworaran said he was saddened to hear of the tragedy and described the community as close-knit and supportive of each other.“There is a Christmas block party here every year and they’ve done it for the 13 or 14 years.Oroworaran said that he did not know the family and they didn’t attend the parties, but he would often see support workers coming and going from the home.One of the boys attended Christ Church Grammar School’s Peter Moyes Centre, which caters for children with autism and learning challenges.The principal of Christ Church Grammar, Alan Jones, emailed families late this afternoon saying the school’s thoughts and prayers were with the family.“Out of respect for the families and to allow the police investigation to take its course, we will not be releasing a statement at this point in time,” Jones said.Murdoch University sociologist Samuel Teague said while the circumstances of this case are still being investigated, these types of tragedies are often the outcome of systems that aren’t working.“We know that parents of kids with special needs are in need of better resourcing, more support and this needs to come from more established means of community and relational support,” Teague said.The family were described on social media as a lovely couple and a good family.A spokesperson for St John Ambulance WA said it sent five crews to the house on Friday morning just before 8.30am on priority 1 conditions, which reflect potentially life-threatening situations.View image in fullscreenThe Mott Close home is in Mosman Park, one of Perth’s most affluent suburbs.Photograph: Richard Wainwright/AAPSecuro described it as a “confronting” and “highly distressing” scene.“The officers are understandably in shock after being confronted with such an incident like this,” she said.“It’s not often that our officers come across such a tragic event with this many persons deceased.“That’s why we employ a health and welfare [officer] and our police chaplain to attend the scene as soon as possible, speak to the officers, wrap our arms around them and make sure they are OK.”Kate Chaney, the federal MP for Curtin, which includes Mosman Park, said in a statement that the suspected murder-suicide was “shocking and devastating for our community”.“My thoughts go out to the friends and relatives of this family, as well as the first responders, and the neighbours and local community who knew them,” Chaney said.“This heartbreaking loss of four lives will have lasting effects throughout our community.“I hope the police investigation will provide more information soon about the circumstances that led to this tragic event.

The Kremlin said on Friday that Putin had received a personal request from Trump to halt strikes on Kyiv until 1 February, but declined to say whether the Russian president had agreed to the request or issued any corresponding order.But there was a noticeable reduction in attacks by both sides overnight after Trump’s announcement.Ukraine’s air force said in a social media post that Russian forces launched 111 strike drones and one ballistic missile at Ukraine between Thursday night and Friday morning. Russian pro-war military bloggers also reported that Moscow had largely limited its attacks to the frontline.Zelenskyy said US officials first proposed the ceasefire during trilateral talks in Abu Dhabi last week, as part of a broader effort to “create more space for diplomacy”.Both sides agreed last spring to a 30-day ceasefire on energy infrastructure, which was not upheld and soon collapsed.Senior Ukrainian and Russian officials are due to meet in Abu Dhabi this weekend for another round of talks, though rising tensions over possible US strikes on Iran have injected fresh uncertainty into the plans.“The date or the location may change,” Zelenskyy said. “From our point of view, something is happening in the situation between the United States and Iran, and those developments could affect the timing.”Trump has repeatedly spoken over the past year of progress towards ending Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, but a viable path to peace remains elusive, with Moscow continuing to press maximalist territorial demands. The Kremlin has insisted that any settlement must involve Ukraine ceding the entire eastern Donbas region, including areas still under Ukrainian control.Kyiv has rejected those terms, though Zelenskyy has said he is willing to consider alternative arrangements, including the withdrawal of Ukrainian troops from parts of the east and the creation of a demilitarised zone.“We will not give up the Donbas without a fight,” Zelenskyy said, adding that “for now, we have been unable to find a compromise on territorial issues.”Explore more on these topicsUkraineRussiaEuropeDonald TrumpVolodymyr ZelenskyyVladimir PutinnewsShareReuse this content"

Hitting military sites? It is unclear what a US attack on Iran would achievePatrick WintourDiplomatic editorFri 30 Jan 2026 13.38 ESTFirst published on Fri 30 Jan 2026 05.59 ESTShareDonald Trump has said he believes Tehran wants to make a deal to head off a regional conflict, as he claimed the US “armada” near Iran was bigger than the task force deployed to topple Venezuela’s leader.“We have a large armada, flotilla, call it whatever you want, heading towardIranright now, even larger than what we had in Venezuela,” the US president told reporters on Friday.“Hopefully we’ll make a deal. If we do make a deal, that’s good. If we don’t make a deal, we’ll see what happens.”He declined to say whether he planned a repeat of the military operation in Venezuela in which US forces captured and renditioned the president, Nicolás Maduro.“I don’t want to talk about anything having to do with what I’m doing militarily,” he said.His comments came after Iran’s foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi said Tehran was ready to negotiate with the US, but only if talks were not under duress and did not extend to Iran’s missile programme.After meetings with Turkish diplomats, Araghchi said Iran was “ready to begin negotiations if they take place on an equal footing, based on mutual interests and mutual respect”. He said there were no immediate plans to meet US officials, adding: “I want to state firmly that Iran’s defensive and missile capabilities will never be subject to negotiation.”Araghchi said: “The Islamic Republic of Iran, just as it is ready for negotiations, is also ready for war.”Trump said on Thursdayhe hoped to avoid military action, even as the US deployed another warship to the Middle East, joining the USS Abraham Lincoln and several guided-missile destroyers.View image in fullscreenIran’s foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi (left), with his Turkish counterpart, Hakan Fidan, in Istanbul on Friday.Photograph: Turkish foreign ministry/ReutersBut his precise objectives remain unclear. Speaking at the premiere of the documentaryMelania, the US president told reporters Iran had to do “two things” to avoid military action. “Number one, no nuclear. And number two, stop killing protesters,” saying that “they are killing them by the thousands”.He added: “We have a lot of very big, very powerful ships sailing to Iran right now, and it would be great if we didn’t have to use them.”Iran has blamed the US and Israel for the protests that erupted in late December over economic grievances, and were brutally suppressed. Activist groups estimate as many as 30,000 people were killed in the ensuing crackdown.‘Deeply ideological’: the rationale behind Iran’s insistence on uranium enrichmentRead moreThe Turkish foreign minister, Hakan Fidan, said the resumption of talks between Tehran and Washington over Iran’s nuclear programme was “vital for reducing regional tensions”. Speaking alongside Araghchi, he claimed Israel was pushing for the US to attack Iran, and urged Washington to “act with common sense and not allow this to happen”.In a call with Iran’s president, Masoud Pezeshkian, Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, said he was willing to act as a mediator between Iran and the US.From Iran’s perspective, the US is piling ever more demands on Tehran that if all were implemented would spell the end of its sovereignty.Trump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff has called for an end to Iran’s nuclear enrichment programme, the transfer of its existing stock of highly enriched uranium out of the country, limits on Iran’s missile programme and an end to support for proxy groups in countries such as Lebanon, Iraq and Yemen.Araghchi held separate phone calls with his counterparts from Qatar, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, Oman and Turkey. All the Arab states have insisted their air ground facilities cannot be used by the US to attack Iran.In Turkey, Araghchi criticisedThursday’s decisionby the EU, likely to be followed by the UK, to proscribe the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) as a terrorist organisation.He said: “The truth is that Europe is a declining continent and has lost its role on the international level and is losing it more and more every day, and it is surprising that they themselves are fuelling this process. This shows that Europe has neither a correct understanding of the international situation, nor a correct understanding of the conditions in our region, nor a correct understanding of its own interests. The decision they made was a major strategic mistake.”Araghchi did not spell out what reprisals were being considered, but the UK Foreign Office has always worried such a move would lead Iran to break off diplomatic relations. But Ali Larijani, the secretary of Iran’s national security council, said in future Tehran would treat the armies of Europe as terrorists.The Iranian supreme leader’s representative in the IRGC said the European action would have serious consequences for the EU.On Friday, the US followed the EU in imposing sanctions against Iran’s interior minister, accusing Eskandar Momeni of repressing the nationwide protests. The sanctions come as anger grows inside Iran that the supposedly reformist government allowed such large-scale killings.In a statement, the Reform Front, a reformist umbrella body, called for “an independent fact-finding committee to investigate this unprecedented disaster and present a transparent and candid report to the Iranian nation”.It also called on the judiciary to refrain from “hasty rulings” against detainees, and said bereaved families must be allowed to freely mourn protesters who were killed in the crackdown.Explore more on these topicsIranDonald TrumpUS foreign policyMiddle East and north AfricaIran's nuclear programmenewsShareReuse this content"

Previously the government and military had only provided figures for militants Israel claimed to have killed.Gaza health authorities said the direct toll from Israeli attacks had exceeded 71,660 people, with at least 10,000 presumed buried in the rubble of bombed buildings.For more than two years, Israeli officials and media hadattackedthe Palestinian figures as “Hamas propaganda” and dismissed them as “not accurate”.The abrupt shift in stance raises broader questions about Israel’s defence of its campaign in Gaza. A UN commission, rights groups andscholars have accused Israel of committing genocide in the territory.map of deaths“What other accusations could turn out to be true?” the Israeli newspaper Haaretzsaidafter the briefing. “The Israeli public must ask itself what this belated recognition indicates about the army and the government’s credibility regarding Israel’s conduct in Gaza.”It is also likely to intensify scrutiny of civilian casualties in Gaza. The Israeli military previously claimed to have killed 22,000 militants in Gaza, suggesting that, by its own count, more than two-thirds of the 70,000 dead were non-combatants.That figure is significantly below the 83% civilian tollindicatedby a classified Israeli military database, but well above the 50% casualty rate previously claimed by Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu.Israel was still reviewing how many of the dead were civilians, the Times of Israelsaid, but believed the overall toll compiled by Gaza health authorities was “largely accurate”.A military spokesperson declined to confirm or deny the figure given at the briefing, saying only that “the details published do not reflect official IDF data”.The Palestinian database does not provide a breakdown of fighters and non-combatants. It does identify most of the dead by name, date of birth and Israeli-issued identity numbers.number of childrenIsraeli attacks on Gaza health authorities ignored a long track record of reliable record-keeping. During past wars in Gaza the final toll recognised by Israel and observers including the UN was broadly in line with Palestinian data.There was little coverage or discussion of the death toll in Israeli media. Most major outlets attended the briefing, but with the exception of Haaretz, initially ignored the new figure.Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper quoted the figure in a report focused on diplomatic manoeuvring between the US, Qatar and Israel. The report quoted an official, saying: “Our estimate is that roughly 70,000 Gazans were killed in the war, not including missing persons.”The paper’s online outlet, Ynet, later published a shortpieceon the toll late on Thursday evening. It was not a headline on television news shows.The Israeli military also said it would open the key Rafah crossing between Gaza and Egypt on Sunday, for the first time since Israeli forces seized control of the border area nearly two years ago, in May 2024.Palestinians who left Gaza could now apply to return for the first time since the war began, a spokesperson said. A European Union force would supervise the crossing, but Israel would retain full control of everyone who entered and left, the spokesperson said.Reopening Rafah has been presented as a central part of US efforts to push Donald Trump’s ceasefire plan for the territory firmly into a second stage. It will only be open to pedestrians, so will not ease shortages of food and shelter aid, medicine and other basic humanitarian goods in Gaza.Explore more on these topicsGazaPalestineMiddle East and north AfricaIsraelHamasnewsShareReuse this content"

This prompted an undignified scramble among western nations to be part of the action, with the UK energy secretary at the time, Tony Benn, having more than a walk-on part.At the heart of the programme was a desire for national sovereignty and power, symbolised by the ability to enrich uranium. But the exorbitant price Iran has paid to exercise that right subsequently in terms of US sanctions, economic misery and now political instability raises questions as to Iran’s true motives.Asked by the Guardian in November in Tehran what cost benefit analysis could possibly conclude that the nuclear programme was a worthwhile project, the foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, referred to Iran’s sovereign right under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, the medical benefits, and the blood of previously assassinated Iranian nuclear scientists. He suggested a compromise whereby a consortium including possibly the US could enrich uranium in Iran, but insisted the principle that uranium would be enriched inside Iran remained sacrosanct.View image in fullscreenAli Khamenei: ‘In this jungle-like world, if the Islamic Republic … has no defence power, won’t even small countries dare threaten Iran?’Photograph: APSo seeking a rationale is difficult. Indeed,Ali Ansari, a professor of modern history at St Andrews University, says: “Those people looking for a rational explanation for Iran’s attachment to nuclear enrichment are not going to find it. It is deeply ideological, almost an obsession with national prestige. It is about making a point and riding the crest of an ultra-nationalist wave.“It also serves a political purpose, including highlighting the unfairness of the west and so nursing a grievance. But the refusal to compromise means that the Iranian economy is being run into the ground for no practical purpose.“The government tries to argue that what is being pursued is a national right, but this is incongruous because it is being pursued at the expense of other civil and human rights that Iranians could enjoy, including better schools and hospitals.”Iran first became seriously embroiled in nuclear power in 1974 when a steep rise in oil prices turned it into a wealthy nation, and the shah drew up plans for 24,000MW of electrical energy to be supplied by 20 nuclear power plants by 1994. With oil expected to decline by the mid-1990s, energy self-sufficiency was the goal, both in terms of the supply of energy, but also technical ability. That meant Iran leaned towards Europe, and not the US or Russia, for investment.The shah’s nuclear experts proposed that Britain and Iran set up a joint nuclear company combining Iranian capital with British technical expertise to oversee the development of the nuclear industry in Iran and the UK. Benn, as energy secretary, became a great fan of the idea, as did Sir William Marshall, the chief scientist at the energy department.As part of the plan, in which both sides would be treated as equals, the UK recognised it would have to help Iran to master the full enrichment cycle, something Henry Kissinger, the US secretary of state, was to come to regret.Ever since Iran started to enrich uranium in 2006, Iran’s relations with the west have turned on the nuclear programme and what was its ultimate purpose, and the conditions with which Iran could be entitled to enrich uranium, including determining the purity levels and stockpile size.There have been moments of breakthrough. In 2013, Iran suspended the right to enrich. And there have been periods of confrontation. Between 2005 and 2013, the Iranian president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, spoke of Iran’s inalienable right to “industrial-scale enrichment under the NPT”. He denounced the west’s hypocrisy in trying to hold Iran back. “That means you [the west] have to climb down from your ivory towers and put aside your arrogance,” he used to say.By the time of the 2015 nuclear deal, Iran’s mastery of civil nuclear technology, including the enrichment of uranium on Iranian soil, had been elevated to “the absolute right of Iran”, according to Iran’s foreign minister at the time, Javad Zarif. Iran’s then president, Hassan Rouhani, declared domestic enrichment to be a “red line”.Ansari says: “Iran’s civil nuclear power is still being projected as a symbol of Iran’s modernity, but the nuclear programme is largely inherited from the shah in the 1970s and is not that modern. Even with full investment by the west, it is 10 years away, so it is not going to contribute greatly to Iran’s energy needs. Instead Iran is sitting on a massive alternative energy source in the form of solar.”He adds: “It leads one to conclude there are some that want the option of a nuclear weapon, but that the option is there for diplomatic leverage – to be able to say we warrant another meeting, and if they are given another meeting they can say we are still relevant and legitimate.”But matters have been made more intractable by the US apparently adding fresh demands, including restrictions on the range of Iran’s missile programme and an end to support for proxy groups in the region, such as the Houthis.Missiles have always been the backbone of Iranian defence. Any commitments by Iran not to arm the Houthis look inherently unenforceable.It is true that Hashemi Rafsanjani, a former president and reformist, once said: “Tomorrow’s world is the world of dialogue not missiles.”But for that he was immediately rebuked by the supreme leader, Ali Khamenei, who said: “In this jungle-like world, if the Islamic Republic seeks negotiations, trade and even technology and science, but has no defence power, won’t even small countries dare threaten Iran? Our enemies are constantly enhancing their military and missile capabilities, and given this, how can we say the age of missiles has passed?”That remains the dominant ideology within which Araghchi is working.Explore more on these topicsIranNuclear powerEnergyMiddle East and north AfricaNuclear weaponsUS foreign policynewsShareReuse this content"

The SDF had previously controlled about a quarter of the country and all of its main oilfields, constituting a significant challenge to the fledgling state’s rule.It came after Syrian government forces swept through north-east Syria, aided by the Arab and tribal elements, shrinking the territory controlled by the SDF by about 80%. The SDF chose mainly to withdraw from Arab-majority areas but were preparing to defend Kurdish-majority cities from government forces, when the deal was struck on Friday.Under the agreement, both sides would pull their fighters back from frontlines in north-east Syria and government security forces would enter the cities of Hasakah and Qamishli, the strongholds of the Kurdish authority.The SDF would integrate into the army, and the Syrian state would absorb the civilian institutions of the Kurdish authority.2:33The 'ticking-bomb' Syrian prisons filled with IS suspects – video explainerA new military brigade in the Syrian army would be formed, which would include three SDF brigades, as well as placing SDF fighters under government command in Aleppo.The Kurdish authority has operated as a de-facto autonomous zone for about a decade, with its own governing institutions and armed forces. Under Friday’s agreement, the scope of its autonomy shrinks significantly and would be replaced by unitary rule from Damascus.In a bid to reassureKurds, one of Syria’s largest ethnic minorities, the deal also included “civil and educational rights for the Kurdish people, and guaranteeing the return of the displaced to their areas”.The agreement read: “The agreement aims to unify the Syrian territories and achieve the full integration process in the region by enhancing cooperation between the concerned parties and unifying efforts to rebuild the country.”The deal was praised by Tom Barrack, the US special envoy to Syria, who had been intensely mediating between the two sides over the last two weeks to stave off a full-scale war. He called it a “profound and historic milestone”.Barrack said in a post on X on Friday: “This carefully negotiated step, building on earlier frameworks and recent efforts to de-escalate tensions, reflects a shared commitment to inclusion, mutual respect and the collective dignity of all Syrian communities.”Friday’s agreement was more favorable to the Kurdish authority than previous ceasefire deals, and appears to have resulted from intensive diplomacy from the US and France, both of which maintain good relations from both sides. It also spelled a virtual end to the Kurdish-autonomous project of north-east Syria, but with relatively little bloodshed.Explore more on these topicsSyriaKurdsMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Hitting military sites? It is unclear what a US attack on Iran would achieveDan SabbaghDefence and security editorDonald Trump now has the firepower in place, but using it might not end wellFri 30 Jan 2026 08.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 30 Jan 2026 14.20 ESTShareA fortnight ago, when Donald Trump first threatened Iran’s regime, telling protesters in the country that “help is coming”, there werenot enough US military assetsin the Middle East to back up the rhetoric. That has now changed, although plenty of questions remain about what an attack on Iran could achieve.An aircraft carrier, the USS Abraham Lincoln, has arrived in the Indian Ocean, dispatched from the South China Sea alongside three destroyers equipped with Tomahawk cruise missiles. Its eight-squadron air wing includes F-35C and F/A-18 jets and, critically, EA-18G Growlers to suppress anything that is left of Iran’s air defences after last year’s war with Israel.Open-source monitors have spotted transport planes bringing what they believe to be US air defence systems to the Gulf. That isin line with reportsthat Patriot and Thaad antimissile batteries would be deployed to protect US bases from any Iranian drone and missile counterattack against military sites in the region.On top of that, squadrons of F-15 fighters – an estimated 35 planes – have been redeployed from RAF Lakenheath in Suffolk to Muwaffaq Salti airbase in Jordan. It had been intended for the F-15s to be flown back to the US, but now they have been deployed as extra defensive cover for Israel, Jordan, Iraq and the region if the conflict escalates.Michael Carpenter, a former member of the US national security council, under Joe Biden, believes that the most plausible military option would be to go after Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, a capture-or-kill operation modelled on the seizure of Venezuela’s former president Nicolás Maduro. Targeting other key Iranian military sites would not obviously degrade the country’s regime significantly, he added. “I find it unlikely, dubious, that these would have the strategic effects sought,” he said.Targeting Khamenei, Carpenter argues, would be “a very fraught operation with a dubious outcome”. The success of the seizure of Maduro relied, partly, on “exquisite intelligence from the inside”, he said, built upover five months of preparationby the CIA and sources within Maduro’s government, but it was unclear how far that existed in the case of Iran, even allowing for possible Israeli help.Israel was chillingly successful in assassinating Iranian leaders during last June’s 12-day war, though afterwards Israeli sources revealed a key method for tracing their locations was tracking the bodyguards’ mobile phones. Procedures ought to have been tightened up. And as the Israeli foreign minister, Israel Katz, acknowledged,Khamenei’s security precautions kept him out of their sightsthat summer.Iran is not likely to have much air defence to protect itself from Tomahawks or incoming jets. Last June, Israeli jets were quickly able to fly over large parts of the country, without suffering losses, paving the way for the US bombing of the nuclear enrichment site under the mountain at Fordow. This month, the US was able to suppress Venezuela’s air defence within a couple of hours.However, a capture operation would have to range over considerable distance (Tehran is about 1,000 miles from the Indian Ocean), which could tip the crude military thinking towards an assassination attempt. That in turn would represent an extraordinary escalation: an attempt by the US to kill the leader of another country with which it is not at war, and from which it faces no immediate threat.A western analyst, who asked not to be named, said they believed a US attempt to try and kill Iran’s supreme leader “is more likely than a capture attempt – and also less risky if it were to involve a standoff munition” – though it would also “depend heavily on the intelligence and the number of people who’ve been co-opted (if any have been) from his protective detail”.Map of US bases in Middle EastThe question then is what would follow. Iran’s regime has been cohesive enough to violently suppress demonstrators,killing perhaps 30,000. If Khamenei were to be killed it is not obvious that any successor would suddenly shift policy in whatever direction the White House seeks. Though Khamenei has shortlisted three potential successors, there may be a struggle for power the US simply cannot control.What is more certain is there would be an immediate military response. On Sunday, Iran’s president, Masoud Pezeshkian, warned that any attack on Khamenei would amount toa declaration of war. Iran’s most potent available form of defence is attack, particularly from high-speed ballistic missiles (whose stock is estimated at 2,000) stored in “missile cities” deep below ground.Trump tells Iran: end nuclear ambitions and stop killing protesters or face US militaryRead moreThe most obvious target for a missile attack, combined with drones, would be the Abraham Lincoln and its allied warships. But Matthew Savill of the Royal United Services Institute argues that Iran “may not be able to fix its position” with available surveillance because it will be sailing out in the Indian Ocean. “The US knows the closer to the Persian Gulf it goes, the more visible it is to the Iranians,” he added.An alternative counterstrike would be to target US military bases in the Gulf, such as al-Udeid airbase in Qatar, headquarters to US Central Command. This month the base was reinforced by new Patriot air defence systems according toChinese satellite imagery, but a consideration for the US is that last June 14% of Iranian ballistic missiles got past sophisticated Israeli and US air defences.This, though, would risk international escalation, bringing Gulf states and their allies automatically into the conflict. The UK has alreadyforward deployed the RAF’s 12 Squadron, a joint UK-Qatari unit at al-Udeid, to deter a possible attack and help the Qataris act in self defence. Another alternative for Iran could be to try andmine the strait of Hormuz, closing it to merchant shipping, though that would rely on submarines that the US will be closely monitoring underwater.Iran’s military options may be limited, but so too are the White House’s prospects of achieving an instant knockout.Explore more on these topicsIranUS foreign policyMiddle East and north AfricaanalysisShareReuse this content"

Pakistan are also reported to be considering boycotting theT20 World Cupin an act of solidarity with Bangladesh, with a final decision expected this weekend.Although the decision to insist that Bangladesh, who have been replaced in the tournament by Scotland, remain inIndiawas taken by the ICC, the BCCI is understood to have lobbied the ICC not to allow the switch. While the ICC says its governance is independent, it has a history of taking decisions that favour the BCCI, such as giving India a guaranteed semi-final in Guyana at the T20 World Cup in 2024 for broadcasting and financial reasons.The BBCI ishugely influential at ICC level and has close links to the Indian government. The ICC chair, Jay Shah, was formerly secretary of the BCCI and his father, Amit Shah, is minister of home affairs in Narendra Modi’s government.The ICC’s chief executive is Sanjog Gupta, who was previously the chief executive of sport and live experiences at JioStar, the media conglomerate that has exclusive TV rights in India for all ICC events.The political row has come at a bad time for India, which, after being confirmed last month as host of the 2030 Commonwealth Games in Delhi, is bidding to host the 2036 Olympics in Ahmedabad, with Qatar seen as its biggest rival.The IOC’s tolerance of political interference is far less than that of the ICC, however, with one source saying that it is unthinkable that India would be awarded the Games if there was a danger of other countries boycotting as a result.The Olympic Charter mandates that sports organisations must operate independently, controlling their own rules and governance, free from outside political influence, while Rule 50.2 explicitly prohibits expressions of political or religious opinions at the Games.The IOC’s zero-tolerance approach was illustrated most recently last October when Indonesia was suspended from having any dialogue over hosting future Olympic events as a sanction for refusing to grant visas to the Israeli team for the World Artistic Gymnastic championships in Jakarta. Indonesia had also been in the race to host 2036 before falling at the first hurdle.International cricket politics could play a significant role in the 2036 Olympic hosting battle, with the sport returning to the Games for the first time since 1900 in Los Angeles in two years, as well as being on the schedule for Brisbane 2032. Including cricket in the Olympic programme is a deliberate attempt by the IOC to court the Indian market, but it will not do so at any cost.Pakistan’s games in the T20 World Cup will take place in Sri Lanka as a reprisal for India refusing to play over the border in last year’s Champions Trophy, and the two countries no longer contest bilateral series.The IOC source added that India will have to show strong signs of improving relations with Pakistan and Bangladesh in order to be considered as a credible Olympic host.Explore more on these topicsInternational Olympic CommitteeT20 World CupIndia cricket teamBangladesh Cricket TeamOlympic GamesTwenty20Sport politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

It secured 232 of the 263 seats up for grabs in the lower Pyithu Hluttaw house and 109 of the 157 seats announced so far in the Amyotha Hluttaw upper chamber, according to results released on Thursday and Friday.Myanmar’s parliament is expected to convene in March to elect a president, with a new government set to take over in April, pro-military Eleven Media Group reported earlier this month, citing junta spokesman Zaw Min Tun.‘This is a fake election’: Polls close in Myanmar but voters have little doubt junta proxy will prevailRead moreThe final round of voting in late January brought an end to an election that began on 28 December, more than four years after the military seized power in a coup that overturned the elected government of Nobel peace prize laureateAung San Suu Kyi.Myanmar has been in political turmoil since the coup, with the crushing of pro-democracy protests sparking a nationwide rebellion. Around 3.6 million people have been displaced, according to United Nations.The 11-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations has said it would not endorse the process, and human rights groups and some western countries have also denounced theelection as a sham.Myanmar’s military government insists the polls were free and fair, and supported by the public.Aung San Suu Kyi’s National League for Democracy party was dissolved along with dozens of other parties, and some others declined to take part, drawing condemnation from critics who say the process was designed to entrench military rule.Under Myanmar’s political system, the military is also guaranteed 25% of parliamentary seats, ensuring continued control even after power is formally transferred to a civilian-led administration.The USDP was founded in 2010 after decades of military-led rule in the southeast Asian country, with the aim of serving as a proxy for the armed forces.The party is chaired by a retired brigadier general and packed with other former high-ranking officers. It contested the poll with 1,018 candidates, a fifth of the total registered.Junta chief Min Aung Hlaing is also expected to play a central role in the next administration. He has defended the polls as a step toward stability, rejecting criticism from opponents and foreign governments and affirming that state responsibilities will be transferred to the elected government.Turnout reached around 55% over all three phases, lower than the figure of around 70% in previous elections, including a 2015 vote that brought Suu Kyi to power, as well as the ill-fated 2020 poll, the results of which were cancelled by the junta before staging the coup.Voting took place in 263 of Myanmar’s 330 townships, some of which are not under the complete control of the junta.It was cancelled in many areas due to ongoing fighting between the military and armed ethnic groups, as well as local resistance forces that emerged after the 2021 coup.Explore more on these topicsMyanmarSouth and central AsiaAung San Suu KyinewsShareReuse this content"

During the visit, Mountbatten-Windsor and Epstein were pictured walking together in Central Park.The former prince said in his disastrous Newsnight interview in 2019 that he chose to meet Epstein in person to end the friendship as he felt breaking the news “over the telephone was the chicken’s way of doing it”.However, newly released emails indicate that Siegal drew up a guest list for what she described as a “very interesting, fast, fun dinner” involving Mountbatten-Windsor and Epstein.She invited the film director Woody Allen and his wife, Soon-Yi Previn; the political strategist George Stephanopoulos and his wife, the actor Alexandra Wentworth; the journalist Katie Couric and the talkshow host Charlie Rose. It is not clear who ultimately attended, but the emails suggest Wentworth withdrew because her children were sick.In the emails, Siegal told Stephanopoulos: “Come on time and you will have private time with Andrew as he is staying at the house.”Separate emails between Epstein and an account named “The Duke” on 11 and 12 August 2010 suggest the financier wanted to introduce “A” to a 26-year-old Russian woman, whom he suggested he “might enjoy having dinner with”.Epstein wrote that the woman would be in London in August 2010. “The Duke” replied that he would be in Geneva “until the morning of the 22nd but would be delighted to see her” and then asked: “Will she be bringing a message from you? Please give her my contact details to get in touch.”The email is signed “A”, with what appears to be an email signature that reads “HRH Duke of York KG”.The person asked Epstein whether there was “any other information you might know about her that might be useful to know?”, to which he replied: “she 26, russian, clevere beautiful, trustworthy and yes she has your email”.In another email released, Epstein’s accomplice, the British socialiteGhislaine Maxwell, addressed a sender who calls themselves “The Invisible Man” as “Andrew”, and referred to “Sarah and the kids”.An email exchange from August 2002 shows the two accounts talking about organising a weekend together on “the Island” only for the Invisible Man to decline, with Maxwell suggesting “5 stunning red heads” would be there.Epstein killed himself in prison in 2019 as he faced fresh child sexual abuse charges. Mountbatten-Windsor has withdrawn from royal life and been stripped of his titles over his links to Epstein.In 2022, he paid a reported £12m settlement to Virginia Giuffre. Giuffre, who killed herself last April, claimed she was forced to have sex with Mountbatten-Windsor after being trafficked to him by Epstein. He has always strenuously denied these allegations and made the payment without admitting liability.The files released on Friday also show that Maxwell sent an email to the Invisible Man expressing her condolences on the loss of his grandmother, the queen mother, who died in 2002.It read: “Sweat pea – sorry you had to rush home, and also under such sad circumstances. However much the passing was to be expected in one so old, it does not make it any less sad.“She was wonderful, and I am happy that I managed to meet her and speak with her. We shall reschedule. Love you. Gx.”A reply the next day from the Invisible Man reads: “Got your message this morning. Sorry to have missed you yesterday I will ring later today to chat. A xxx.”Maxwell is serving a 20-year jail sentence in the US for child sex trafficking.In another email from the same account, the sender asks someone, whose name has been redacted, if they are having more children and labelling them “super sperm”.The email said: “Sorry – I am in LA on my way to Hawaii. Is it true you are having more children? I shall have to refer to you as super sperm!”The tranche of messages also showElon Musk had more extensive ties to Epstein than previously known.Emails from 2013 appear to show the two cordially messaging each other to make plans for the entrepreneur to visit Epstein’s island Little St James.It also emerged thatEpstein sent thousands of pounds in bank transfers after his release from prison in 2009 to Peter Mandelson’s husband Reinaldo Avila da Silva, according to the emails published by the US Department of Justice.Da Silva emailed Epstein on 7 September 2009, about two months after Epstein was released from prison, asking him to fund an osteopathy course and other expenses.Mandelson said on Friday: “I was never culpable or complicit in his crimes. Like everyone else I learned the actual truth about him after his death.”Da Silva has not yet commented.In the UK and Ireland,Samaritanscan be contacted on freephone 116 123, or emailjo@samaritans.orgorjo@samaritans.ie.

Epstein had served 13 months of an 18-month sentence for soliciting prostitution from a minor, for which he was registered as a sex offender. Mandelson was business secretary at the time and in a relationship with da Silva. The pair married in 2023 after 27 years together.Da Silva asked Epstein to fund an osteopathy course and other expenses, saying: “I sent you a couple of emails last week regarding my osteo course expenses, incl fee, anatomical models, laptop if you can help me with this. I hope you received them.“I just managed to speak to the fees office at the osteo school and confirmed that my annual fee is of £3,225 … They accept bank transfer and the details are as follows.”Epstein responded later that day and said: “I will wire your loan amount immediated’y [sic].”View image in fullscreenAn email that was included in the US Department of Justice release of its Jeffrey Epstein files.Photograph: Jon Elswick/APThe next day, Da Silva emailed Epstein again to ask if a £10,000 payment included his school fees or if that amount had been transferred to the school itself. Epstein responded: “includedd” [sic].After da Silva sent details about his course, to which Epstein said he would “wire the loan amount”, Mandelson emailed Epstein saying: “Remind him that to avoid a gift-tax filing it must be a loan.”Da Silva emailed Epstein on 17 September and said: “thank you for the money which arrived in my account this morning”.Da Silva messaged Epstein again in April 2010 and shared his bank details, according to the Financial Times which first reported the allegations. Epstein reportedly forwarded the email to his accountant and said: “send 13k dollars”. He later instructed his accountant to “send 2k per month to reinaldo” [sic].View image in fullscreenJeffrey Epstein pleaded guilty, in 2008, to a charge of procuring for prostitution a girl below the age of 18.Photograph: US Justice Department/ReutersAn email from Epstein to Mandelson on 19 July 2009 suggested the financier had met da Silva while serving the last few days of his prison sentence for soliciting prostitution. Epstein had served most of his sentence in a work-release programme that allowed him to leave jail during the day to go to his office, then return at night.In the email Epstein said: “you didn’t call me ,„ i spent an hour with rinaldo.. call me tomorrow.. at office.”Mandelson responded: “I was immersed in Afghanistan … thanks for talking to Reinaldo. It did him (therefore me) a lot of good. You now see the problems. I cannot talk to him about these things at all, he won’t listen. I am doing Sunday media then will call. Thanks again xxx.”Epstein replied: “I as always am there.”Mandelson said on Friday: “I was wrong to believe Epstein following his conviction and to continue my association with him afterwards. I apologise unequivocally for doing so to the women and girls who suffered.“I was never culpable or complicit in his crimes. Like everyone else I learned the actual truth about him after his death.“But his victims did know what he was doing, their voices were not heard and I am sorry I was among those who believed him over them.”Earlier this month,Mandelson apologised for his association with Epstein. The latest batch of documents show Epstein and Mandelson were in frequent contact, often sending each other short messages about their whereabouts.Emails released in November by the House oversight committee, which is conducting an inquiry into the US government’s handling of the Epstein case, revealed Mandelson and Epstein were still in contact in 2016.Explore more on these topicsPeter MandelsonJeffrey EpsteinLabournewsShareReuse this content"

He isn’t welcome in the party.”But Labour, which is seeking to present itself as the only viable leftwing option for votes against Reform in theGreater Manchesterconstituency, said Robinson’s intervention showed that “the stakes couldn’t be higher” for the 26 February contest.“Tommy Robinson’s endorsement of Reform’s candidate shows who he really is and what he stands for,” aLabourcampaign spokesperson said.“The Greens simply cannot win this byelection, leaving a stark choice between unity and change with Labour, or division and risk with Reform.“Only a vote for Labour can stop the toxic politics that Reform and Tommy Robinson would bring toManchester.”The Greens, whounveiled their candidateon Friday, argue in turn that Labour’s polling woes and its decision not to allow Andy Burnham, the Greater Manchester mayor, to stand in the seat, mean they are the most credible opponent for Reform.But according to a Labour internal memo, prepared for Downing Street, the party has received encouraging messages from door-knocking so far, with what was described as a “strong” rate of people pledging to vote Labour, and less support for the Green party.The memo goes on to say that Labour mobilisation of volunteers has been more rapid “than any previous byelection the party has fought in recent years” and that the campaign has had an “incredibly strong start”.Goodwin, 44, a former academic who is now a GB News presenter and hard-right activist, was a controversial choice to represent Reform in the byelection, particularly afterhe claimed recentlythat UK-born people from minority ethnic backgrounds were not necessarily British.Speakingat an eventin Denton on Tuesday at which he was unveiled as the Reform candidate, Goodwin twice declined to answer when asked by the Guardian whether he stood by the views. He hadalso said: “It takes more than a piece of paper to make somebody ‘British’.”Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, first came to notoriety as leader of the English Defence League, an anti-Islam street group based initially around fellow football fans in his home town of Luton.He has been convicted of criminal offences including assault, mortgage fraud and using a false passport. In 2018 he wasmade an adviserto Gerard Batten, the then leader of Ukip, prompting Farageto quitthe party he had led for years.Since Robinson’s X account was reinstated under Elon Musk’s ownership of the platform, he has gained prominence, including in the US, presenting himself as a self-styled journalist and campaigner, although the bulk of his content is far-right material targeting immigrants and Muslims.His increased profile was highlighted last September when a “unite the kingdom” protest he organised was attended bybetween 110,000 and 150,000 people.Explore more on these topicsReform UKLabourByelectionsGreater ManchesterManchesternewsShareReuse this content"

Train operators said passengers who were due to travel on Friday could choose to use their tickets on Saturday instead.Services were able to run normally out of London by 4pm but some disruption remained because of earlier cancellations and delays.The fire was reported at 9.31am on Friday, according to the London fire brigade, which sent 10 fire engines and about 70 firefighters to tackle the blaze in Regent’s Park Road.The fire burned through a single-storey commercial building and most of a neighbouring property. There were no reports of injuries and the cause of the fire was under investigation, the brigade said.A witness, William Selas, 40, said that he could see a lot of fire and smoke from his bedroom window. “Oh my God, I saw so many firefighters come around,” he said. “Hopefully it’s going to be all right and we won’t have to leave the house or run away.”Explore more on these topicsRail transportTransportEnglandNetwork RailFirefightersLondonnewsShareReuse this content"

Authorities seized 700 boxes related to 2020 election results in the county, which Biden won.Democrats express alarm at Tulsi Gabbard’s presence at FBI elections office raidRead moreTrump’s national intelligence director, Tulsi Gabbard, was alsoseen at the county’s election office that day,drawing concern from Democratic lawmakers about partisan overreach.Brown was replaced the week before the service of the search warrant at the elections office,as first reported by the Associated Press.The personnel decision was not publicized by the FBI, and the AP said the reason for Brown’s removal was not immediately clear.Robb Pitts, the Fulton county board of commissioners chair, spoke out against the Trump administration’s decision to raid the office, arguing that it was unjustifiedpolitical retribution. Pitts also reaffirmed that, despite the search warrant, the county hadnothing to hide.“Fulton county elections are fair and lawful, and the outcome of the 2020 election will not change,” he said. “Period.”The Guardian has reached out to theFBIfor comment.Election integrity experts have said that the 2020 presidential race was the most secure to date. And dozens of legal challenges brought by Trump’s allies that sought to challenge his defeat in that election failed.Nonetheless, Trump continues to falsely claim that the 2020 election was rigged against him in favor of Biden.Trump has not questioned the integrity of the 2024 presidential race, which he won against Vice-President Kamala Harris after Biden dropped his re-election campaign late in the contest.Explore more on these topicsFBIGeorgiaTrump administrationUS politicsAtlantanewsShareReuse this content"

Does Sunday evening for dinner sound good?”An individual whose name is redactedreplied: “Below from Jeffrey: come sat or sunday lunch? little st james on the map, behind christmans cove.”The documents appear to suggest that a meeting took place, as on 24 December, Epstein emailed his assistant with the subject line: “please forward to howard lutnik”.The email body reads: “nice seeing you, read #2 dot three.” The assistantresponds“Will do!” and thenforwardsthe message to Lutnick.On Friday, theNew York Timesreached Lutnick by phone and Lutnick said he could not comment about the island visit because he had not seen the latest tranche of Epstein documents.“I spent zero time with him,” Lutnick said before ending the call.Also among the newly released tranche of files related to Epstein are documents suggesting Lutnick invited Epstein to a fundraiser for Hilary Clinton in 2015.The document includes anemaildated 3 November 2015 in which Epstein’s longtime assistant forwarded him an email from Lutnick, the former CEO of the financial firm Cantor Fitzgerald, with an invitation to a “very =ntimate [sic] fundraising event”for Hillary Clinton on 11 November.Per the document, Epstein’s assistant forwarded the invitation email to Epstein that same day.It is unclear whether Epstein attended the event.At the time, the New York Postreportedon a fundraiser that month held at Lutnick’s home, which the paper described as being “next door to Jeffrey Epstein’s house”. It is not clear if it was the same event.These new documents come after Lutnick acknowledged in a podcastinterview withthe New York Post’s Miranda Devine that Epstein was his neighbor, and recounted that in 2005 Epstein invited Lutnick and his wife into his home, and gave them a tour.“Big living room, and then across from it is double doors, I assume it’s the dining room, and he opens the doors and there’s a massage table in the middle of the room, and candles all around and stuff,” Lutnick said. “I say to him, ‘Massage table in the middle of your house? How often you have a massage?’ And he says, ‘Every day.’ And then he like gets, like, weirdly close to me and he says, ‘And the right kind of massage.’“Now, my wife is standing here, so she looks at me and I look at her and we say, ‘I’m sorry, we have to go,’” Lutnick continued. “And we left, and in the six or eight steps it takes to get from his house to my house, my wife and I decided that I will never be in the room with that disgusting person ever again. So I was never in the room with him socially, for business, or even philanthropy. If that guy was there, I wasn’t going, cause he’s gross.”The commerce department did not immediately respond to a comment request from the Guardian regarding the 2015 email.Cantor declined to comment about the 2015 fundraiser to the Guardian.Explore more on these topicsJeffrey EpsteinTrump administrationUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Powell’s second term as chair is due to end in May.Writing on his Truth Social platform,Trump said: “I have known Kevin for a long period of time, and have no doubt that he will go down as one of the GREAT Fed Chairmen, maybe the best. On top of everything else, he is ‘central casting’, and he will never let you down.”What is behind the extraordinary rise in investment into silver and gold?Read moreWarsh, 55, a formerFederal Reservegovernor who has deep ties to Wall Street, had previously interviewed for the job of chair in 2017 when the role went to Powell. Trump’s pick will have to be confirmed by the Senate.Being the chair of the Fed is one of the most powerful roles in the US government, with enormous influence over the world’s largest economy.Stephen Brown, a US economist at CapitalEconomics, said markets were likely to consider Warsh “a relatively safe choice” and his nomination would alleviate concerns that the president was going to pick “a full-blown Trump stooge” to be the next Fed chair.Mark Carney, the Canadian prime minister and former governor of the Bank of England, said in a social mediapostthat Warsh was “a fantastic choice to lead the world’s most important central bank at this crucial time”.The dollar strengthened early on Fridayafter it was reported that Warsh was expected to be Trump’s choice, and was up 0.5% against a basket of currencies after the nomination. Gold fell by 9.1% to $4,903.60 an ounce. Silver dropped 26.7% to $85.12 an ounce. Wall Street traded slightly lower, with the benchmark S&P 500 down 0.5% in New York.Warsh will still need at least 51 votes in the US Senate to be confirmed. Though Republicans have a 53-47 majority in the chamber, multiple Republican senators spoke indefenseof Powell after it emerged that the Fed chair is under federal criminal investigation. One senator, Thom Tillis of North Carolina, said he would block any of Trump’s Fed nominees until the investigation is called off.On Friday, Tillis said that Warsh was “a qualified nominee with a deep understanding of monetary policy” but said that he would still vote against him until Powell’s investigation is resolved.Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat and ranking member of the Senate’s banking committee, said in astatement: “No Republican purporting to care about Fed independence should agree to move forward with this nomination.”Warsh has warned about inflation risks in the US in the past, but has also echoed Trump’s critique of the Fed for being too slow to cut interest rates. High interest rates can alleviate inflation at the risk of upping unemployment. Rates are currently at a range of 3.5% to 3.75%, which most economists at the Fed currently see asneutralto prices and unemployment.Since resigning from the central bank in 2011 over its post-financial crisis stimulus package, Warsh has criticised it publicly on multiple occasions. In April last year, he issued a stinging attack,sayingthe institution’s central bankers should not be treated as “pampered princes” and it too regularly “opines on matters outside its remit” which has led to “systemic errors” in its main role of trying to keep prices stable.View image in fullscreenA video of the Federal Reserve chair, Jerome Powell, plays on a screen on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange on 12 January.Photograph: Richard Drew/APWarsh, a New Yorker who was special assistant for economic policy from 2002 to 2006, served as Fed governor between 2006 and 2011, a period that included the response to the global financial crisis, and was its representative to the G20 group of countries.He is now a lecturer at the Stanford Graduate School of Business and has roles at the courier UPS, the Korean e-commerce company Coupang and the Duquesne Family Office, the investment firm of the billionaire Stanley Druckenmiller.Warsh is married to Jane Lauder, the granddaughter of the cosmetics magnate Estée Lauder and daughter of Ronald Lauder, the billionaire who has interests in Greenland andencouraged Trump to attempt to acquire the territory.Other candidates on the shortlist to be Federal Reserve chair had been Kevin Hassett, the national economic council director; Christopher Waller, a Fed governor; and Rick Rieder, an executive at BlackRock.Warsh has been a longtime critic of the ultra-loose monetary policy pursued by the Fed since the financial crisis, including the central bank’s expanded balance sheet. He had previously been seen as a monetary policy hawk, but appears to have aligned himself with the White House’s push for lower borrowing costs.In December, Trump said of Warsh: “He thinks you have to lower interest rates.”Renaissance Macro Research said in a note that Warsh could have been siding himself with the president to appease him. “Warsh has been a monetary policy hawk his entire career and most importantly, during a time when the labor markets fell out of bed,” it said. “His dovishness today stems from convenience. The president risks getting duped.”Brown said Warsh’s “long-running hawkish views should help to counteract concerns that he might morph into a full-blown Trump stooge.“That said, his firm conviction that both AI and the Trump administration’s regulatory push will help to hold down inflation, as well as his longstanding view that the Fed should operate with a much smaller balance sheet, present the risk of some upward pressure on long-term bond yields.”Trump himself had suggested that he was considering whether to install Hassett, a White House official and one of his top economic advisers, as Fed chair.On Friday, Trumpwroteon social media: “Their [sic] was great speculation that highly respected Kevin Hassett was going to be named Chairman of the Fed, and a great Chairman he would have been but, quite honestly, he is doing such an outstanding job working with me and my team at the White House, that I just didn’t want to let him go.”Explore more on these topicsFederal ReserveDonald TrumpUS economyJerome PowellEconomicsUS interest ratesDollarnewsShareReuse this content"

She was on a leadership track.In a disclaimer included in the letter, she said her statements aboutLiz and Dick Uihlein, the company’s founders and owners, were based on her own opinion, and that all claims about their political relationships and donations are alleged. She urged people to Google their record.“The most insidious form of evil is that which hides behind outward decorum, concealing the violence of its intent behind written policy, monetary donations, and old-fashioned principle. It’s easy to see the evil of those who are outwardly violent, tactless, and crude, but it’s harder to see the evil of the frail old man and his wife, who comes around once a year to rearrange our paintings,” she wrote.The political activities of the Uihleins, who recently hosted a speech by Vice-President JD Vance in their Allentown, Pennsylvania, facility, are well known.The couple are rankedas the fourth largest donors in the 2024 election cycle, having donated $139m to Maga Republicans and their political action committees, according to Opensecrets, which tracks money in politics.Liz Uihlein in particular is known forthe pointed lettersshe includes in the company’s thick hundred-pages long catalogues, which she signs. One missive in 2022 criticized workers who were leaving the company after less than two years of employment, given the “precious resources” used to train them.View image in fullscreenVice-President JD Vance delivers remarks on the economy at Uline in Alburtis, near Allentown, Pennsylvania, on 16 December 2025.Photograph: Ryan Collerd/AFP/Getty ImagesShe called them “nomads” and blamed the Affordable Care Act –which has been gutted in the first year of Donald Trump’s second term– for allowing young adults to remain on their parents’ insurance until age 26 and “go where the grass looks greener”. She blamed parents who “pay for their kids’ phone bill, car insurance and streaming services” who ought instead to “kick them out of the nest so they can learn to fly”. She also blamed stimulus checks, which meant “people didn’t get off their couches to work”.In her resignation, Wittmann referenced the 2022 “nomad” letter, saying she believed it was a sign of the disdain Liz Uihlein felt toward people who elected to leave. Wittmann wrote in her letter that workers should consider their higher-than-average pay not as an act of generosity as it is framed by Uline, but instead an “assurance of compliance”.She wrote: “I truly believe that the Uihleins and others like them are the biggest threat to global peace, equity, and quality of life. With their money and influence, they could sway politicians against the horrors unfolding in their own backyard” she wrote. Instead they support the people and organizations “committing the horrors”.Uline declined to comment.The resignation letter was removed from workers’ emails about 40 minutes after it was sent, Wittmann was told by some of her now-former colleagues. A copy of the letter, which was printed by someone who received it before it was deleted, was shared with the Guardian and published on Reddit.Wittmann’s decision to speak her mind was also influenced by a recent trip to theWar Remnants Museum in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, where she learned more about how few consequences were felt by individuals who committed atrocities in the war and domestically,including in the aftermath of the Kent State massacre, when 28 national guardsmen opened fire on anti-Vietnam protesters and killed four students.“What has changed since then? Or more importantly, what will ever change if we are too afraid to speak out and accept some personal risk?” she wrote. “This email is the least I can do.”In her letter, Wittmann included a call for defiance from other Uline employees. “What is happening now in America and across the territories they invade is either by the design or the indifference of people like the Uihleins,” she wrote. “The system will never change if we continue to work under them and allow their kind to succeed. However small or passive a role we might play, Uline employees are all parts in the American imperialist war machine.”“I’ve always been interested in social justice,” Wittmann said by phone. She may go back to school, she said, or just take some time to figure it out. She was bolstered by positive feedback she received from former co-workers and also people in Wisconsin, who found her letter on Reddit and reached out to her.Wittmann also said she received a voicemail from Uline saying they accepted her resignation and that it was effective immediately. Wittmann said she was not expecting to be paid severance, under the circumstances, and said she felt fortunate to be in a position where she could afford to “take a hit”.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpWisconsinRepublicansTrump administrationMinnesota ICE shootingsUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

The White House has yet to specify tariff rates for violating its new policy of blockingCubafrom buying oil.AWhite House statementcited Cuba’s ties to hostile powers to explain the new tariff policy, citing the Cuban government’s alleged ties to Russia, Hamas and Hezbollah.“These actions constitute an unusual and extraordinary threat to US national security and foreign policy, requiring immediate response to protect American citizens and interests,” the White House said.Cuba is an import-dependent Caribbean island nation ofabout 8 million inhabitantswhose $85bn GDP is similar to that of Rhode Island. The Communist party of Cuba has ruled the country for six decades.The Trump administration had pressured other countries to stop providing oil to Cuba in the lead-up to Thursday’s tariff announcement. Trump has tussled with Mexico’sClaudia Sheinbaumfor weeks over the issue.Sheinbaum has insisted that Mexico’s state oil company, Pemex, will continue to fill contractual obligations with Havana and may offer oil for humanitarian reasons.“The humanitarian aid will continue, as it does to other countries,”Sheinbaum saidat a press conference earlier this week. “Mexico has always shown solidarity with the entire world. They are sovereign decisions.”Still, Sheinbaumacknowledged earlier this weekthat Mexican oil shipments had paused for the moment.Mexico’s president says cancellation of oil shipment to Cuba is ‘sovereign’ decisionRead moreMexico has been a major oil supplier for Cuba, providing 20,000 barrels a day through most of last year, according to NPR. That figure amounts to a little less than a third of the 70,000 daily barrels that Venezuela provided last year,according to the Miami Herald. Cuba reportedly resold much of its Venezuelan oil supply, however.Cuba is facing major economic pressure since US forces arrested the Venezuelan leaderNicolás Maduroand his wife in a surprise attack and whisked them to New York to face federal drug-trafficking charges. Under US pressure, Cuba lost access to Venezuelan oil, its principal supplier.The US secretary of state,Marco Rubio, is the son of Cubans who emigrated from the island to Miami before the Cuban revolution that broughtFidel Castroto power in 1959 and a fierce opponent of the regime he founded.Cuba had already rationed gasoline and imposed limited daily electricity blackouts as it struggled with limited oil supplies. The island only has15 to 20 days’ worth of oilin inventory, according to a report from the Financial Times.Tourist visits haveplummetedin the face of the economic turmoil and Trump’s open efforts to topple the communist government.“Cuba will be failing pretty soon,” Trump told reporters earlier this week, adding: “They got their money fromVenezuela.

They’re not getting that any more.”Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsCubaDonald TrumpTrump administrationOilVenezuelaUS foreign policynewsShareReuse this content"

What did they know beforehand?The prediction market’s disciples and CEO believe its an unbiased way of knowing the future. But experts warn users could reshape the world to win bigNiamh RoweFri 30 Jan 2026 07.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 30 Jan 2026 15.15 ESTShareIn the early hours of 13 June, more than 200 Israeli fighter jets began pummeling Iran with bombs, lighting up the Tehran skyline and initiating a 12-day war that would leave hundreds dead.But for one user of the prediction market Polymarket, it was their lucky day. In the 24 hours before the strike occurred, they had bet tens of thousands of dollars on “yes” on the market “Israel military action against Iran by Friday?” when the prospect still seemed unlikely and odds were hovering at about 10%. After the strike, Polymarket declared that military action had been taken, and paid the user $128,000 for their lucky wager.But was it just luck?Polymarket is an online platform where people can bet on just about anything, from what the most-streamed song on Spotify will be to how many times Donald Trump will say “terrible” that day. Under Joe Biden, the unregulated site was banned in the United States, although it could be accessed with a VPN. Now, over $100m worth of bets are placed on Polymarket each day.The user who had placed the bet was new to Polymarket. Since then they have lodged five bets on similar markets like, “Israel announces end of military operations against Iran before July?” and “Israel strikes Iran by January 31, 2026?” All have been successful, making further profits of more than $28,000.The Guardian’s analysis of blockchain data traced the wallet to an X account with its location set to Beit Ha’shita, a kibbutz in northern Israel. The user recently transferred their bets to two other accounts, data shows, potentially to avoid detection. There, they currently have 10 live bets relating to Israel’s military strategy.The X user behind the account could not be reached for comment but Israel Defense Forces and the Israel Security Agency have opened an investigation into the user, officialssaidlast Thursday.Chart of bets on the Polymarket for “Yes” odds on “Israel military action against Iran before July?”Unlike sports betting sites like DraftKings, where users have to scan their IDs before they are able to place a bet, Polymarket is built on a blockchain. Accounts are linked to crypto wallets that can be publicly traced but are difficult to link back to an individual. So, even though the company is headquartered in the US, its markets are global and the users anonymous.Online prediction betting markets look ahead after US presidential election triumph: ‘We’re just getting started’Read moreOnline prediction markets found mainstream traction in 2024 by letting everyday Americans wager on the US presidential election.Americans were already becoming hooked on online gambling after the 2018 supreme court ruling that legalized sports betting. But that election supercharged the desire to bet: the twists and turns of the presidential race meant it already felt like a spectator sport.Polymarket’s virality was initially powered by manosphere influencers. The Barstool Sports founder Dave Portnoy broadcast election odds to more than 200 million followers, right-leaning X accounts weaponized the markets, which were predicting a Trump victory, against mainstream polls, which showed a tight race. Crypto streamers pitched political betting as just another high-risk, high-reward trade.Since then, Polymarket and its rival Kalshi have gamified all corners of life – from tomorrow’s weather to Bad Bunny’s Super Bowl outfit – and in effect, turned reality itself into a casino.To bet on an outcome, users buy either a “yes” or “no” event contract. These are priced between $0 and $1, and like any market, their price fluctuates depending on demand. If a “yes” contract is worth $0.80, the market thinks it’s 80% likely. If the “yes” thing happens – a team wins their game, a director wins their Oscar, a bomb drops on a city – the value of the correct contract shoots up to $1, while the wrong contract drops to $0. If you buy thousands of contracts for something that seems really unlikely, $0.10 for Israel striking Iran, say, then when that contract reaches $1 – you stand to make a huge profit.For example, one account created in November has been solely dedicated to wagering that Trump will appoint Kevin Warsh as the next chair of the Federal Reserve, persisting even when the odds dropped to 7%. After Trump announced Warsh this morning, they will profit $142,000.I think [these prediction markets are] affecting us more than we probably realizeYesha YadavPolymarket disciples reject the idea that they are merely gambling, they see the markets that result from the bets placed on the site as critical sources of information. The thinking is that Polymarket odds, based on the guesses of people willing to put their money where their mouth is, are a better method of predicting the future than flawed polls or biased commentators. They see Polymarket, primarily, as journalism.“It’s the most accurate thing we have as mankind right now, until someone else creates some sort of super crystal ball,” Polymarket’s CEO, Shayne Coplan,told60 Minutes in November, shortly after the 28-year-old was anointed the world’s youngest self-made billionaire, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.Polymarket provides a “credible, lightning-fast news channel for hundreds of millions of people”, said the blockchain analyst Andrew 10 Gwei [he goes by his X username], who has been exposing insider activity within crypto startups since 2020 and has more recently turned his focus to Polymarket. “You gain access to critical information about key world events faster than everyone else.”Polymarket called the 2024 presidential race before the polls. The 2026 Golden Globes announced real-time Polymarket odds as the telecast headed into commercials,correctly predicting26 out of 28 winners and taking a lot of the suspense out of the ceremony itself. Media entities such asCNNandthe Wall Street Journalhave partnered with prediction markets and integrated their data into their reporting.But this is not the first time America has used prediction markets to hedge outcomes.A century ago, political betting was rampant on Wall Street. Bookmakers correctly predicted 11 out of 15 elections between 1884 and 1940. These odds would be splashed across newspapers each election cycle – “never wrong”, assome papersput it. During some election years, the betting on political outcomes would exceed trading in stocks and bonds.However, election betting wouldn’t survive the Prohibition era’s moral clampdown on gambling. Critics warned these markets risked election tampering and information withholding. At the same time, the arrival of scientific polling provided an uncontroversial alternative to finding out the mood of the nation. After the success of Gallup in predicting the 1936 election, many newspapers scrubbed Wall Street odds from their pages.Whales, beards, mules and VIPs: the secret world of high-rolling professional gamblingRead moreBut today’s gambling revival looks nothing like the past: betting is now borderless, anonymous and limited only by imagination.“We’re still trying to understand how these markets are going to affect our lives, but honestly, I think they’re affecting us more than we probably realize,” said Yesha Yadav, a professor at Vanderbilt law school. When Yadav asked her students recently if they bet on prediction markets, a sea of hands shot up. “It’s just becoming normal,” she said.Event contracts are considered derivatives, so online prediction markets fall under the jurisdiction of the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), who, under Biden, had fought hard to block them.Election markets are “contrary to the public interest”, Rostin Behnam, former CFTC chair said in 2023, adding that regulating them would be both “impractical” and force the agency to act as “an election cop”.But under Trump, the CFTC has pulled back. It dropped its legal fight to ban Kalshi’s election markets, and permitted Polymarket to operate domestically under its jurisdiction.Business has been booming ever since: the total value of bets bought on the sites in just the month of December surpassed $8.3bn, up 1,300% from February, according to DefiLlama data. That’s about the same asthe monthly sales of Target.Yet, as the list of markets grows longer, so does the number of people sitting on valuable information. Concerns have been mounting about alleged insider trading.The world first caught on to the problem after the US capture of Venezuela’s leader, Nicolás Maduro, in January. Shortly after, reports circulated that a new Polymarket account had profited more than $400,000 by betting Maduro would be ousted by the end of January. The wagers were placed in the days and hours running up to Trump revealing the capture on Truth Social.Yet, the profiteering may run deeper than this. The Guardian identified more than a dozen Polymarket accounts with the hallmarks of possible insider trading: large, accurate bets lodged shortly before the event, with little other activity – and are not hedging their bets across multiple accounts. Collectively, the accounts have profited about $2.17m.The bets that weren’t gamblesThe markets with suspicious activity cross many areas of life, some involve foreign diplomacy, others congressional votes. From big tech announcements to an international award.On 26 December, the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy,postedon X that he and Trump would meet before the new year. A cluster of five new Polymarket users cashed in a collective $154,000 from the statement. The bets on “Will Trump meet with Zelenskyy by December 31?” were lodged within a few hours of one another, all one day before Zelenskyy’s statement.Blockchain data suggests the accounts may be jointly owned. Three of the wallets funding these accounts have transactions between them, and four link to the same Binance wallet. The wallets frequently interact with a Ukrainian-founded cryptocurrency exchange and one features the Ukrainian flag with the bio “#standwithUkraine”.Earlier this month, Ukrainian regulatorsbannedPolymarket for conducting an unlicensed gambling business.Diagram of the relationships between Polymarket accounts that bet on the Trump-Zelensky meetingIn October, Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado Parisca won the Nobel peace prize. Shortly after, major news outlets reported about aspikein Polymarket activity before the announcement, with one user having profited more than $65,000, prompting the Nobel Institute to launch an investigation.But the scale was far bigger than previously reported: the Guardian uncovered eight jointly owned, new accounts which collectively profited more than $161,000, with wagers placed 12 hours before the winner was revealed. Among them are politically charged usernames like “fmaduro”, “madurowilllose”, “trumpdeservesit” and “striketheboats”.One new account made $17,000 betting on the date of the US government shutdown, the bulk of which was made from a bet made the night before the House passed the government funding bill.Another made $25,000 predicting which shows would be Netflix’s first and second most-streamed shows that week – in the US and globally – with correct bets placed in 10 Netflix markets for two weeks in a row.Three have bet exclusively on announcements from Strategy, a publicly traded bitcoin treasury company, profiting more than $143,000 since July.Twelve emerged in October to bet on the launch of OpenAI’s new browser, profiting $50,000, with all but one now lying inactive.Could it be that all of these accounts were just normal users who randomly placed life-changing amounts of money on niche markets, took the profits, and never gambled again? It’s conceivable – but seems almost impossible. The likelihood is that these bets were made by people with prior knowledge of the market’s outcome.The problem is proving it. Because what constitutes insider knowledge is ambiguous.What’s cool about Polymarket is that it creates this financial incentive for people to go and divulge the information to the marketShayne Coplan, Polymarket CEOTake this macabre example: a new Polymarket account made $142,000 betting that Thailand would strike Cambodia just hours before the market resolved. Blockchain data links the wallet to a person based in Thailand. But reports suggest the bets occurred while the strikes had already begun. Seeing missiles, getting evacuated, or hearing local reports first does not make them an insider – they simply had the advantage of circumstance.Whether insider trading should be illegal, even in more traditional markets, was for a long time a matter of debate. Up until the 1930s, this kind of activity was allowed on the stock market; corporate insiders could freely trade on non-public information. But after the 1929 Wall Street crash, in order to keep ordinary Americans trading, Congress needed to convince them the stock market was not a rigged casino. So, in 1934, it outlawed “any manipulative or deceptive device” in connection with trading securities.Regulators and courts have since interpreted that law to include trading on the basis of “material, non-public information”. There’s been thousands of cases over the decades, including a lawyersentencedto 12 years in prison for trading on information stolen from pre-eminent law firms.Kalshi, Polymarket’s main competitor, hasrulesprohibiting insider trading. A spokesperson said they freeze accounts that show suspicious behavior while they investigate trades by analyzing that user’s social connections and have already “disciplined a number of users”. Kalshi says that it is a financial crime for users that have “material, non-public information”, about a market to place a bet on that market.Polymarket is not centrally regulated and does not ban insider trading. Instead, it falls to the users to comply with the law wherever they are based, a spokesperson said.However, after the CFTC allowed Polymarket to operate in the US in November, Polymarket rolled out a regulated, waitlist-only version of its app for US users. This app does require a government-issued ID and prohibits insider trading. It only has a limited selection of markets.But US users only need a VPN to access the unregulated version of the site and it’s presumed millions of Americans have placed hundreds of millions worth of bets in this way. This violates Polymarket’sterms of use, but because Polymarket does not collect customers’ personal information, it can only verify their identity with an IP address, which can easily be altered with a VPN.View image in fullscreenPolymarket’s CEO, Shayne Coplan, at the 2024 Democratic national convention in Chicago, Illinois.Photograph: Matthew Reeves/BFA.com/Shutterstock“Of course there’s people who are working on it that know when it’s going to come. What’s cool about Polymarket is that it creates this financial incentive for people to go and divulge the information to the market and the market to change,” CEO Coplan told 60 Minutes.“Insider trading is a core feature of the system. It’s what makes them the fastest and most accurate news source in the world,” said Andrew 10 Gwei, who has been exposing insider activity within crypto startups since 2020 and has more recently turned his focus to Polymarket. He estimates to have found dozens of these accounts over the past month or two, totalling millions of dollars in profits.X is inundated with self-proclaimed insider-hunters like Andrew who track suspicious activity and use this information to inform their own trades. Andrew lets people know when he thinks he has spotted an insider, so that laypeople can quickly copy their bets.“People are keen to learn how to track insider accounts, or at least get information about them, primarily to find financial opportunities. I doubt anyone following me considers insider trading on Polymarket wrong or harmful,” said Andrew.Rather than insider traders, Andrew likes to describe the people betting on Polymarket with near-certainty as “privileged money flow” – people who possess unique expertise and positioning that allows them to predict the correct outcome of specific events before everyone else.“I see nothing wrong with, say, a meteorologist with 20 years of experience and access to modern equipment earning an extra salary on Polymarket. Because of their position, they can predict weather changes with 99% more accuracy than the rest of the market,” he said.But this mechanism also gives a financial incentive to divulge classified material.“If you know we’re going to bomb Iran in the next week and you start placing bets, then the prediction market tells the Iranians they’re about to get bombed,” said Richard Painter, who was the chief White House ethics lawyer under George W Bush.So, in theory, Maduro could have escaped if he had simply checked Polymarket.“That could be a very, very dangerous thing, because all the countries need to do is look at the prediction markets and try and figure out what the heck we’re going to do,” he said.A Polymarket spokesperson said that the CFTC-regulated version of its app, which requires government-issued ID and prohibits insider trader in compliance with the law, was currently being rolled out for US users. However, the main site – where the markets the Guardianidentified were created – only requires a crypto wallet. While it does not ban insider trading, local laws still apply to the markets, the spokesperson said. Accessing this site via VPN to circumvent geoblocking violated Polymarket’s terms of use, they added.The military mapthat changed to win a betThe claim that insider trading makes markets more honest has a long history in libertarian thought. In 1966, the prominent US legal scholar and economist Henry Manne argued insider trading would make the market more efficient, and letting insiders buy stock before good news goes public could function like a performance bonus.But the law went in the other direction. From the 1960s, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) aggressively expanded insider trading enforcement, warning that it defrauds investors, reduces trust in markets and distorts corporate behavior.The same harms apply to prediction markets, experts warn.Let’s say you bet $50 that Sinnerswill win best picture at the 2026 Oscars. Hamnet takes it. Your losses are used to pay the winning wagers.Except, let’s say one of those winners works at PwC, the consultancy that organizes the voting. Suddenly, it no longer feels like a loss, but a theft.It’s clear that fortune is not evenly distributed on Polymarket. Fewer than 0.04% of Polymarket accounts have profited a collective $3.7bn, capturing more than 70% of total realized profits, data from the blockchain analyst DeFi Oasisshows.On Polymarket, the comment sections beneath markets with sudden, unexpected outcomes are littered with disgruntled users suspecting foul play.If enough traders start to feel the markets are rigged, an “unfairness epidemic” can take hold, said Yadav, meaning less trading volume and less accuracy.But the risks run deeper than investor confidence. In SEC v Texas Gulf Sulphur Co(1968), the court warned that insider trading laws are needed to prevent corporate management from “manipulating the timing and flow of information for personal advantage”.Prediction markets also risk distorting real-world decision making – but with significantly higher stakes.On 7 January, Kalshishoweda 98% probability that White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt’s briefing would exceed 65 minutes. But then, with 30 seconds to go, Leavitt concluded abruptly. Winning traders saw returns of nearly 5,000%.While this may have been coincidence, Painter warned the stakes could get higher, like someone in the Department of Justice recommending a pardon because their friend has a bet on it.“The real damage isn’t the people who were dumb enough to place a bet. The real damage to the public is a government official who makes a decision they otherwise wouldn’t have made,” said Painter. “That could have a cataclysmic effect on our government and the ethics of our government.”When you’re a government insider, the term prediction market is a misnomer, because … you’re the one making the decisionRitchie TorresWe have already seen an example of someone in a position of authority reshaping the world to win a bet.Onemarketspeculated on what date Russia would capture the Ukrainian city of Myrnohrad. It was resolved on 15 November when the live map generated by the Institute for the Study of War (ISW), which Polymarket uses to adjudicate territories, updated to show a Russian advance. Then, moments after the market closed, the map reversed and the advance disappeared. The Guardianidentified three new accounts that made large bets either the night before the map changed, or in the minutes after, profiting $9,300 in total – a return of about 3,500%.The ISW’s “control of terrain” map is used by journalists, governments and analysts to track the frontlines of the Russia-Ukraine war. Manipulating it spreads disinformation about a Russian attack and could interfere with the conflict itself.The ISW shared a statement on its website acknowledging that an “unauthorized and unapproved” edit of its map had taken place, but did not mention betting markets. A spokesperson said the ISW “strenuously objects” to Polymarket using its map, and it disapproves of all betting on the Ukraine war.‘My son was shaking, trying not to go online’: how the gambling industry got its claws into childrenRead moreJust days after the Maduro trade, Representative Ritchie Torres of New York introduced thePublic Integrity in Financial Prediction Markets Actbanning members of Congress, their aides or administration officials from making trades on prediction sites based on “material, non-public information”.“The CFTC’s authority over prediction markets is poorly defined. It’s a gray area. There’s a need for legislative clarity from Congress,” Torres said. With 39 Democratic co-sponsors already, he said he was optimistic about finding a Republican co-lead.Torres considers the bill a “starting point” for a broader regulatory framework for prediction markets, including a ban on insider trading. Outlawing government officials from trading on insider information is most urgent, he said, as bets create a “perverse incentive” to influence political decisions.The bill, however, falls short of a total ban of government officials using prediction markets. That means even if it passes before November’s midterm elections, betting on the results may be fair game.“But you can intentionally lose an election,” Painter points out, who advocates prohibiting officials from these sites altogether.As Torres put it himself: “When you’re a government insider, the term prediction market is a misnomer, because if you’re the one making the decision, or if you’re part of the decision-making process, you’re not predicting anything. You’re governing for profit.”"

Tisch replied a minute later to ask, “Is she fun?”The next month, Tisch asked Epstein multiple questions about a different woman from Tahiti, including if she was a “working girl”. To that, Epstein replied, “Never.“Also in June of that year, Tisch emailed Epstein and appeared to ask about a different woman they’d previously discussed, writing, “Is my present in NYC?” Epstein replied, “Yes.” The next morning, Tisch asked Epstein, “Can I get my surprise to take me to lunch tomorrow?“Tisch, 76, had a successful career as a film producer, most notably producing Forrest Gump. Some of the emails reviewed Friday showed women speaking with Epstein about meeting Tisch for dinner to discuss work in upcoming movie projects.But the correspondences made clear Tisch sought sexual relationships.

But he endured, holding on to execute in the critical moments, as he had done against the Houston Texans the week before.New England’s victory over Denver came down to two plays. The arm was off the table in the wind and snow, so Maye’s athleticism came to the fore with a 28-yard scramble up the middle as he sensed the orange sea parting just enough for him to dart the Patriots into chip-shot territory and a 10-7 lead in the third quarter. Then Maye put the Broncos to the sword with a rogue audible. He again took off running, this time for a game-sealing first-down, outfoxing Denver by not telling his offensive line he was going to ignore his coach’s call for a stretch run and keep it. The vision to see the opportunity – and the confidence to then make it happen – was special.Of course, the MVP is for regular season performance, and doesn’t include the playoffs. So the argument over whether Matthew Stafford’s league-leading total yards and touchdowns make him the better MVP candidate is legitimate, but only if you like one-yard throws to Davante Adams on the goalline. Maye has better numbers in many other areas, including completion percentage (72%), QBR (77.1) and yards per attempt (8.9). Those numbers speak to a 23-year-old with the maturity to vault his team from 4-13 last season to the Super Bowl this time around. If the Patriots prevail in Santa Clara, Maye will be at the heart of the matter, finding the path through the Seattle Seahawks’ smothering defense.Sam Darnold: after five teams and plenty of mockery, ‘Ginger Cuz’ reaches the Super BowlRead moreOffensive player(s) of the yearIn the NFC championship game, the Seahawks’Jaxon Smith-Njigbaand the Los Angeles Rams’Puka Nacuaraised a question: what if the Alien v Predator films were good? If you lose sight of Smith-Njigba for a split second you’re already done for, such is his speed and ability to separate. Nacua is as versatile as they come, able to beat you 100 different ways, running through defenders at will. Fittingly their stat sheets werealmost identical last Sunday: Smith-Njigba had 10 catches for 153 yards, while Nacua had nine for 165 yards (each player also grabbed a touchdown). Both are under 25, so hopefully we have many more years to see them push each other to even greater heights. Three cheers for the NFC West.Defensive player of the yearMyles Garrettenjoyed arguably the greatest year from a defensive player in NFL history by delivering the most sacks ever in a regular season (23). This was no flash in the pan: Cleveland’s formidable defensive end is the only player to make at least 12 sacks in six successive seasons. It’s a shame thatthe Browns’ dysfunctionmeans Garrett has never played for a Super Bowl contender – although, of course, he had a chance to force his way out.Chris Wesseling person of the year awardIt is easy to let significant moments in your life fade as the years roll by. Broncos linebackerAlex Singletonbrought the memories flooding back for me. In Novemberhe was diagnosed with cancer; a few days later he played in his team’s win over the Las Vegas Raiders. I’m not comparing manning the Guardian’s sports desk to tackling a marauding running back, but when I faced the same diagnosis eight years ago I wanted to get straight back to work too. Singleton’s resilience was inspiring – he missed only one game for the Broncos after his surgery. The strength of mind and spirit lit a fire in me, as NFL.com writer Chris Wesseling had when he shared his battle with cancer on the Around the NFL podcast. So cheers, Alex, for a wonderful reminder ofChris’s huge heart. One he so readily shared with me during a drunken rampage through London to celebrate my recovery. I only wish Chris had been as lucky as the two of us.Rookie of the yearCam Skattebo, who else? The fun-loving running back brought a spark to the New York Giants amid a volatile season. There was even some hope of success at MetLife Stadium when the Giants thrashed the Philadelphia Eagles 34-17 and Skattebo’s nonstop energy almost single-handedly brought down the Super Bowl champions. The rematch would quickly deliver a bitterly cruel blow as Skattebo dislocated his right ankle and fractured his fibula, cutting short what had been the most joyous reminder that theNFLshouldn’t take itself quite so seriously.Play of the yearAllow content provided by a third party?This article includes content hosted onembed.bsky.app. We ask for your permission before anything is loaded, as the provider may be using cookies and other technologies.

If, like me, you are slightly distracted by Johnson flexing like a maniacin this clip, then “good, better, best.

A shirt is optional.Self-sabotage of the year“Of all the players I have ever negotiated with, Michael Parson is as savvy and knowledgable and understanding of his financial business relative to football as any player I have ever been around,” said the Dallas Cowboys owner, Jerry Jones, after trading away defensive endMicah Parsonsto the Packers. Jones’s subtext: I’m annoyed that playing for the Cowboys isn’t dazzling enough to let me bully one of the NFL’s biggest stars into signing a deal below his market value so I’m going to say his name wrong. Classy. Jones’s inept trade, powered by an incredible sulk, blew up Dallas’ already undermanned defense leaving them well short of the playoffs. Green Bay’s $188m star would have mixed it up in the postseason had he not sustained a torn ACL in December.Sack of the year/gaff of the yearAaron Rodgers has just thrown a 68-yard touchdown to put Pittsburgh ahead 31-30 in Cincinnati with two minutes left in their Week 7 matchup. The 41-year-old is jumping, fist pumping and bounding to celebrate with his fellow Steelers. Only his 311lb left tackle wants to join in. As they reach the sideline,Broderick Jonesdelivers a blindside hit, knocking his quarterback flat on his face. Slightly off script for a left tackle. Rodgers then rolls over, attempts a shove as he gets back to his feet while raging at Jones for getting to the quarterback. Rodgers lamented to Jones in a text, “I love your energy. But also I’m 41. You can’t be out there tackling me like that.” Jones wryly disagreed postgame: “If he throws another touchdown on Sunday I might tackle him again.”Explore more on these topicsNFLNew England PatriotsLos Angeles RamsAaron RodgersUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

At 38 years old, he is the oldest Australian Open men’s finalist in history.Djokovic shocks Sinner in late-night thriller to reach Australian Open finalRead more“I never stopped believing in myself,” he said. “There’s a lot of people that doubt me. I see there is a lot of experts all of a sudden that wanted to retire me or have retired me many times the last couple of years.“I want to thank them all, because they gave me strength. They gave me motivation to prove them wrong, which I have tonight. For me, it’s not a surprise, to be honest. I know what I’m capable of.”It took an superlative display from the Serb to defeat Sinner, who has become one of the two dominant forces in men’s tennis alongside Carlos Alcaraz. Djokovic played bold, offensive tennis, eviscerating his forehand, serving brilliantly in the important moments and matching the Italian’s physicality despite being 14 years older than his rival.“I wouldn’t dare to call it [my] finest ever [victory] but definitely the finest in the last couple of years,” said Djokovic. “Under the circumstances and semis against Sinner, who has been playing best tennis of his life in the last couple of years, particularly here … the two-time defending champion, [it] doesn’t get better than this.“Honestly, when I started my preparations for the new season and kind of set the goals, it’s no secret that grand slams are where I want to play my best tennis. But it becomes, I guess, more difficult for me to motivate myself, and I ask myself questions. ‘OK, what is it that I’m looking for from myself?’ I was imagining playing against Jannik and Carlos [Alcaraz] at the final stages of grand slams this year and battling it out and really giving it all that I have.“So, very fortunate to already get it in the first slam of the year. So, yeah, big win. Very proud. Very happy. Very relieved, as well, because it was physically very demanding and gruelling.”Djokovic will next face Alcaraz, the No 1, after the Spaniardsurvived his own five-set epicagainst Alexander Zverev, the third seed: “I know I have to come back in less than a couple of days and fight the No 1 in the world,” said Djokovic. “I just hope that I’ll have enough gas to stay toe to toe with him.

Neither Jack Dutton nor Biffle had the right endorsement on their pilot’s licenses to serve as a copilot on that plane, but it’s not clear whether the experience of the copilot played any role in the crash. The report said that a thrust reverser indicator light wasn’t working before takeoff, but after the plane got into the air, the pilot’s altimeter and some other instruments weren’t working.The nature of the problems with the plane isn’t clear at this stage in the investigation, partly because the cockpit voice recorder cut out at times and NTSB experts have only just begun to dig into what caused the crash. Over the radio, Jack Dutton announced, “we’re having some problems here” and the cockpit recorder captured part of the conversation between the three pilots about the issues with the plane.Biffle’s wife, Cristina, and children Ryder, 5, and Emma, 14, were killed in the crash along with his friend, Craig Wadsworth.Biffle, 55, won more than 50 races across Nascar’s three circuits, including 19 at the Cup Series level. He also won the Trucks Series championship in 2000 and the Xfinity Series title in 2002.In 2024, Biffle was honored for his humanitarian efforts after Hurricane Helene struck the US, even using his personal helicopter to deliver aid to flooded, remote western North Carolina.Hundreds of people in the Nascar community gathered at an arena in Charlotte earlier this month to honor Biffle at a public memorial service.The jet had departed Statesville Regional Airport, about 45 miles (72km) north of Charlotte about 10 minutes before it crashed while trying to return and land.The plane’s speed and altitude fluctuated significantly during the brief flight. At one point, the plane quickly soared from 1,800 feet (550m) up to 4,000 feet (1,220m) before descending again. Just before the crash, it was only a couple of hundred feet off the ground. Experts said its path was consistent with a flight crew that experienced an issue and needed to return quickly.Explore more on these topicsNascarMotor sportUS sportsShareReuse this content"

Vonn’s airbag deployed on impact and she remained down for several moments while medical staff attended to her on the piste.Vonn, Shiffrin and Kim headline US ski and snowboard team for 2026 OlympicsRead moreVonn eventually stood and was able to ski away, but did so gingerly. She repeatedly took weight off her left leg, using her poles to steady herself, and stopped several times on the run down to check her knee. At the finish area she was met by her teammate Jacqueline Wiles, with the two sharing a long embrace before Vonn limped into a medical tent for further evaluation. She was later airlifted from the finish area by helicopter, suspended by a rope as she was transported away across the Swiss Alps.Vonn’s coach this season, the two-time Olympic champion Aksel Lund Svindal, told Reuters, “She has some pain so it’s better to have some checks, the physio did some checks, they seemed OK but there were things he was not 100% sure so it was good to have it checked.”Race officials cancelled the downhill shortly after Vonn’s crash, with three of the first six skiers having fallen in difficult conditions on a course that had already been shortened because of the weather. Austria’s Nina Ortlieb crashed in the same upper section as Vonn but was able to ski away, while Norway’s Marte Monsen hit the nets near the bottom of the course and was taken away on a stretcher with facial injuries.Romane Miradoli of France, one of the few skiers to complete her run, said visibility was a major issue. “You can’t see, and it’s bumpy everywhere,” she said. Asked whether conditions were dangerous, Miradoli added: “We just couldn’t see well.”Vonn had been the sixth starter and the first of the seeded racers to leave the gate. She was leading at the first checkpoint before landing a jump off balance, lifting her left arm and pole high in an attempt to regain control.

She is also entered in the super-G and the new team combined event. The women’s alpine events will be held in Cortina d’Ampezzo, a venue where Vonn has enjoyed some of the greatest success of her career, with a record 12 World Cup victories.Any injury at this stage would be a major concern for the United States team and for Olympic organizers, who have billed Vonn as one of the standout stars of the Games. A US Ski and Snowboard spokesperson said Vonn was being evaluated following the fall.Despite the uncertainty, Vonn sought to play down fears that her Olympic bid was over, insisting she still hoped to compete in Cortina.“I crashed today in the downhill race in Switzerland and injured my left knee,” Vonnwrote on social media. “My Olympic dream is not over.”She added that she was continuing to undergo medical evaluations, saying she was “discussing the situation with my doctors and team” and would continue to undergo further examinations.Vonnhas been in outstanding form this season, leading the World Cup downhill standings with five podium finishes from five races, including two victories. Her performances have underpinned an unlikely return to the top of the sport following a partial knee replacement on her right leg less than two years ago. Shecame out of retirement last seasonafter nearly six years away from competition and has described her physical condition as the best it has been in years.View image in fullscreenLindsey Vonn of the US is airlifted to the hospital after sustaining an injury in a crash during her run on Friday in Crans-Montana, Switzerland.Photograph: Denis Balibouse/ReutersThe fall also revived memories of a career marked by serious injuries. Vonn tore the ligaments in her right knee in a high-speed crash at the 2013 world championships and was airlifted from the course. She suffered further damage the following season and missed the 2014 Sochi Olympics as a result. Over the course of her career she has also broken arms and legs and sustained a concussion.Despite those setbacks, Vonn remains one of the most decorated skiers in history. Shewon Olympic downhill goldat the 2010 Vancouver Games, eight years after making her Olympic debut as a teenager in Salt Lake City. Like her US teammate Mikaela Shiffrin, she is among the most successful female World Cup racers of all time.Three training runs for the Olympic downhill are scheduled in Cortina d’Ampezzo from 5–7 February, with the medal race set for the following day.“This is a very difficult outcome one week before the Olympics,” Vonn wrote. “But if there’s one thing I know how to do, it’s a comeback. It’s not over until it’s over.”Friday’s race in Crans-Montana was due to be the final competitive downhill before Olympic training begins next week, with the first official downhill training run scheduled for Wednesday. The World Cup stop was staged under a subdued atmosphere after aNew Year’s Eve bar firein the resort that killed 40 people and injured more than 100.Explore more on these topicsLindsey VonnSkiingUSA Olympic teamWinter Olympics 2026Mikaela ShiffrinUS sportsWinter OlympicsShareReuse this content"

I don’t have a lot of time to watch it, but I love the racing.”Penske suggested there was “no better way for us to bring automotive and speed into the DC area, and to be able to have the opportunity to compete here with our Indycars”.A news release from Indycar said the route would include the National Mall, and the executive order gives the Departments of Transportation and the Interior two weeks to designate a route through Washington “that is suitable for conducting an Indycar street race and that will showcase the majesty of our capital city in celebration of the 250th anniversary of America’s independence”.The order also directs city and other officials to work closely with race organizers.The event continues Trump’sembrace of sports during his second term. Most of his domestic travel has been built around attending major games and events – including the recent NCAA football national championship in Miami Gardens, Florida.The president has also been personally involved in promoting aUFC fightto help mark America’s 250th anniversary which he has said is set for 14 June on the White House grounds – a date that happens to be his 80th birthday.But Trumpisn’t planning to attend the upcoming Super Bowlon 8 February between the Seattle Seahawks and the New England Patriots in Santa Clara, California, suggesting it’s too far to travel.In Indycar’s case, the race is set to come to him.US transportation secretary Sean Duffy, who also attended Friday’s signing ceremony in the Oval Office, gushed: “To think, 190 miles an hour down Pennsylvania Avenue. This is going to be wild.”Trump said he urged organizers to pick the best race route through Washington’s streets – even if they were more complicated logistically.“I said, pick the best site. It’s very important,” the president said. “Even if it’s more difficult to get, to get approved, pick the absolute best site.”Organizers said they’d long lobbied members of Congress to authorize a road race in Washington but had been previously unsuccessful. Duffy asked when the last road race in the capital occurred and was told it was in 1801 and involved horses during the administration of Thomas Jefferson – prompting Trump to reply, “That’s something.”“Now we’re going to do a real race,” said Duffy, who said the event would be free for the public, declaring: “Freedom, America. Speed. And road racing. It doesn’t get more American than that.”Explore more on these topicsIndycarMotor sportNascarUS sportsShareReuse this content"

Both men arrive as world champions across multiple weight classes, both are 28 and prime, and both view the contest as a gateway to pound-for-pound recognition and the untold opportunities it confers.Teófimo López: ‘Anything that has haunted me from the past, I’ve let all those things go’Read moreLópez (22-1, 13 KOs) enters as the WBO and lineal champion at 140lb, making the fourth defense of the belt he seized with amasterclass performance against Scotland’s Josh Taylorin 2023. Stevenson (24-0, 11 KOs), already a three-division world champion from 126lb through 135lb, moves up in pursuit of a fourth divisional title and his most high-profile victory to date.Despite the ample domestic and international implications of Saturday’s main event, it will also carry the feel of a derby between fighters with deep local ties. López was born in Brooklyn’s Sunset Park neighborhood to Honduran parents, while Stevenson hails from across the Hudson in the brick city of Newark, New Jersey. That pairing is likely to generate plenty of heat inside the Garden, even as Manhattan shivers through a biting spell of sub-freezing temperatures.The setting is a familiar one for López, who built much of his career at the Garden’s smaller theater next door. It was there heoverwhelmed Richard Commey in two roundsto win his first world title, and there too that his fast rise stalled witha surprise loss to George Kambosos Jrin 2021. Those swings have come to definea career marked by extreme fluctuationsin form.At his best, López has operated with a shimmering brilliance. His victoriesover Vasiliy Lomachenkoand Taylor showcased his explosiveness, timing and ability to rise to the moment against elite opposition. At other times, even in victory, he has appeared prone to lapses in focus, particularly against opponents who deny him space or urgency. This time, López says he has deliberately stripped away distractions in preparation. “No media, no documentaries, no cameras this time,” he said during Thursday’s final press conference at the Garden. “I tried to change that around. So much more work has been done, among myself more than anything else.”View image in fullscreenShakur Stevenson, above, accused Teófimo López’s father of having a drinking problem during Thursday’s press conference at the Theater at Madison Square Garden.Photograph: Cris Esqueda/Matchroom BoxingStevenson represents a very different challenge. The southpaw has built his reputation on control – of distance, tempo and risk – flummoxing opponents with deft footwork, positioning and a defensive skillset that has drawn comparisons toFloyd MayweatherJr and Terence Crawford. He stacks rounds by denying exchanges and forcing opponents into mistakes they struggle to correct.“He’s one of a kind,” said James Prince, the rap mogul turned boxing impresario who has managed Stevenson since he turned professional afterwinning silver at the 2016 Rio Olympics. “He’s his own person and a student of the game. He has taken aspects from the great Andre Ward, the great Roy Jones, yet he’s borrowed from all of them and blended it into his own mix. Now he’s Shakur Stevenson. One of a kind.”If the contest settles into a measured, technical battle, Stevenson is widely viewed as having the edge. His jab, anticipation and ability to neutralize danger have allowed him to dominate rounds without absorbing punishment.Tale of the tape: Teófimo López v Shakur StevensonYet questions persist as Stevenson steps into a fourth weight class. While he has shown little vulnerability to physicality at lower weights, López represents the most explosive and athletic opponent he has faced. López’s punching power, particularly on the counter, has the capacity to change a fight in a single moment. The champion insists he feels equipped for that challenge. “All around, this is the best I’ve felt going into a fight – mentally, more than anything else,” he said.For López, the tactical challenge is clear. Against a defensively sound left-hander who thrives on opponents’ mistakes, recklessness could prove costly. At the same time, passivity risks ceding rounds to Stevenson’s methodical work rate and precision. Striking the balance between pressure and patience may determine whether López can disrupt Stevenson’s rhythm and create openings.Targeting the body is expected to be a key part of López’s approach. Previous opponents have had limited success drawing Stevenson’s guard down with feints and jabs before attacking downstairs – an area López has shown a willingness to exploit. Even blocked shots could serve to slow Stevenson’s movement and force resets.View image in fullscreenTeófimo López arrives at Thursday’s press conference at the Theater at Madison Square Garden.Photograph: Cris Esqueda/Matchroom BoxingStevenson, meanwhile, is likely to focus on controlling range and denying López the chance to set his feet. His use of the lead hand – probing, doubling up and changing cadence – has unsettled opponents and drawn them into errors. When those mistakes come, Stevenson’s counters, particularly from mid-range, have been decisive.The bout is also a test of temperament. López has acknowledged inconsistency in recent years, while insisting those issues are behind him. He enters a fight as the underdog for only the third time as a professional, a role that has previously teased out career-best performances against Lomachenko and Taylor. Stevenson, by contrast, has rarely been forced to chase a fight or regain momentum, though the caliber of his opposition has come under scrutiny, not least by López himself.Both men traded a flurry of profane, unprintable insults at Thursday’s presser, yet each projected calm rather than nerves. Asked whether the edge to the matchup had run deeper than rhetoric, Stevenson brushed it aside. “When it gets personal, that’s when people get emotional,” he said. “I ain’t emotional. I’m focused.”López and Stevenson emerged from the same cohort of American prospects alongside Devin Haney, Ryan Garcia and thedisgraced Gervonta Davis. López reached the summit first with his win over Lomachenko, while Stevenson has climbed more methodically, accumulating belts with fewer setbacks. Saturday’s bout offers a chance to reset that hierarchy.“It’s all business,” Stevenson said. “I’m not treating it that way, but I’m 100% focused and we’ll see on Saturday night.”Explore more on these topicsBoxingTeófimo LópezUS sportsTerence CrawfordGervonta DavisFloyd MayweathernewsShareReuse this content"

Two of the three were brothers; both were known members of the notorious Lazio Ultras, theIrriducibili, it was stated in the release, and had boasted of havingpersonal ties to former boss Fabrizio Piscitelli, who was murdered in 2019. The crimes the brothers had been arrested on suspicion of had not been committed in Rome, but 400 miles north, in the small alpine ski resort of Cortina d’Ampezzo, high in the Dolomites, and home, for the next three weeks, to the Winter Olympics.The brothers are still awaiting trial, but the local public prosecutor’s office has alleged that they were running an operation in three phases. The first was taking control of the drug distribution network in Cortina, the second was to take control of three nightclubs, and the third was to extort the local council into awarding the construction contracts for the works being done for the Games. Among the evidence the prosecutor says it possesses is a note on one of the brothers’ phones saying: “We want the cemetery area for the garages, the former pastry shop, the slip road and the new ring road, the construction of the tourist village.”According to the Italian government’s Antimafia Investigative Directorate (DIA), 38% of all the anti-mafia measures taken in Italy in 2024 were related to the construction sector, when about 200 public works sites were investigated for suspected infiltration by organised crime. The last mega-event held in Milan, the World Exposition in 2015, was blighted bycorruption around construction contracts. The Expo cost €2.6bn (£2.25bn). The bill for the Winter Olympics is running at well over double that amount.The DIA alsoreported to parliamentthat “the Winter Olympics represent a significant event … for criminal syndicates interested in gaining a foothold in the tender awarding procedures”. In 2024 “50 anti-mafia interdiction measures were adopted” in Lombardy alone. One was issued against a construction company working on the construction of an underground car park included in the “Plan of Works for the Milan-Cortina 2026 Olympics”, after the “company’s directors were found to have personal and professional relationships with members of several ’Ndrangheta gangs”.The two brothers were not members of the mafia, according to the prosecutor, but have been charged with using the “mafia method”: extortion, coercion and intimidation. The claims allege the men threatened and beat rival drug dealers, dragged a nightclub owner into the woods at gunpoint, and attempted to corrupt a councillor by offering to secure him votes in exchange for construction contracts, then threatening him when he refused to cooperate with them. “This is Cortina, we’re in charge here,” the men are claimed to have said during their arrest, “I’m not a small-town criminal, I’m the boss and we’ll solve this thing with guns.”If Italy has problems, it also has solutions. “It’s sort of circular,” says Leonardo Ferrante, who is on the national board of the anti-mafia organisation, Libera. “Italy is known as the country of the mafia, but it should also be known as the country of the anti-mafia movement.” Libera was founded in 1994 by the streetwise priest Luigi Ciotti, with the initial aim of collecting a million signatures to petition for a new law permitting the reuse of goods confiscated from criminal organisations. They have joined together in aradical programme called Open Olympics 26, in an effort to make the public procurement procedures around the Games more transparent.View image in fullscreenThe Palazzo del Ghiaccio will host the curling competitions at the Milano Cortina 2026 Winter Olympics.Photograph: Claudia Greco/ReutersOpen Olympics 26’s signature achievement has been to get the Games organisers to commit to publishing all their financial dealings on a single, public portal, which is updated every 45 days. Because of that, we know that only €1.6bn is being spent on the realisation of the Games, the remaining €4.12bn is on related works, including an astonishing €2.816bn on road projects, and that more than half of the projects won’t be completed until after the Games are over, with the latest scheduled for completion in 2033.“The initiative originated in the autumn of 2023, emerging from a significant rift between Italian civil society and the institutional bodies. And well, after years of this attempted dialogue, we started to organise a community and a network of associations asking for transparency and accountability,” says Ferrante. “Everything currently known about the Olympics in terms of data is the direct result of the action of the Italian civic groups.” It is thanks to their work, for instance, that we know 60% of the 98 Olympic projects listed on the portal have been done without any environmental impact assessment.“InItaly, we have strong laws on transparency but we have a lot of exceptions, and one of these exceptions is the Olympics and Paralympics.” Ferrante’s colleague Elisa Orlando adds: “It is a very Italian problem. We have seen it in other mega-events, like the Universal Exposition in Milan 10 years ago. We get into a position where it becomes an emergency. We have to deliver before the opening date of the event and this provides for exemptions, not only to transparency, but sometimes also to procedures in the public procurement processes.”The more transparent the dealings are, the less inviting they become for organised crime. It has been only partly successful. Libera has pushed for more disclosure around subcontracting, and an entire tranche of the Olympic project exists off the portal, in the hands of private companies. “The Fondazione Milano Cortina is the black hole of transparency.”Three of the last six Olympic Games, in Sochi, Rio and Tokyo, involved enormous corruption scandals. At a time when fewer and fewer cities are willing to follow through on mooted bid proposals because of public scepticism about costs (Krakow, Oslo, Stockholm, Innsbruck, Sion and Calgary all withdrew from the competitions to hold the 2022 and 2026 versions) the Open Olympics project represents a radical step towards addressing some of these longstanding problems. The team is already working with organisations in France to replicate this work before the 2030Winter Olympics, which are being held on the other side of the Alps.“The risk of criminal infiltration exists everywhere, not only in Italy. But here in Italy, we have lenses that allow us to recognise criminal infiltration when it occurs,” says Ferrante. “Our third aim is to build an international civic legacy. We want to create an international movement for the transparency of the Olympics.”Explore more on these topicsWinter Olympics 2026Winter OlympicsItalyEuropeMafiafeaturesShareReuse this content"

I’m not insane. Not a Meaden or a Paphitis. But perhaps one of the minor ones, some strangely groomed South African retail magnate called Dork van Frotwangle who looks as if he keeps a bag of human fingers in his freezer and will mysteriously disappear mid-series and never be mentioned again.One key project I’m working up right now is the Temporary Burner Identity. Burner phone. Disposable online backstory. Pre-pixelated features. Can you imagine the joy of being able to go somewhere or do something and not be watched or identified? This is the future of luxury freedom (write that down, Dork).The Arsenal fan psychodrama: Big Defeat Headloss hits hard after United setback | Chris GodfreyRead moreBeing able to travel to, say, Spain, and nobody knows you’re there. To buy things, have experiences, meet people, and it’s not part of an indelible digital footprint that will echo and rebound and stalk your existence, popping up decades later in those on-screen boxes that want to sell you elite incontinence pants in massive letters while you’re on the train.Or more broadly, just being able to escape. To breathe and get lost in the world, to exist in some anonymous space free from the white noise, the ceaseless robot voices of daily existence. This is human life now ever since The Great Networking of the early 2010s. We are all condemned to live like General Zod in Superman, hurtling through space inside a giant iPad, faces pressed up against the glass in a silent scream.And OK, you won’t be hidden exactly. Just mutable, like you’re striding past the face recognition cameras wearing an endlessly interchangeable Hannibal Lecter-style human face. Like you’ve scissored off a selection of human faces and carry them around in a briefcase and this is actually fine.And OK, OK, yes, it would obviously be used for crime, because every human invention enables crime, its first principle always: what’s the nonce angle here? So perhaps we could build in failsafes. We could monitor you. We could store your movements and data. Just in case. Actually, maybe don’t wear the Temporary Burner Identity at all. That’s probably easier. Buy it. Don’t use it. But we will throw in a mail order powder that gives you a six-pack and makes you magnetically charismatic (disclaimer: powder will not create six-pack or magnetic charisma).This is the real problem. The networked existence. Being seen all the time. It has become inescapable. Nobody planned this properly or thought about what it might do to us. Nobody makes enough allowances for its effects, an advanced version of the Albert Camus idea that everyday life is so absurd that just existing is an act of revolutionary courage, that behind the eyes of every human is a dizzying matrix of pain and confusion. And yes, the algorithm is telling me you’re also thinking about Victor Gyökeres here.View image in fullscreenViktor Gyökeres: a matrix of pain and confusion?Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianThe big question in the current Premier League season is unexpectedly textural. Not so much what tactical shifts are in play, or who is the best goalscorer. But why does it feel like this? Why does an otherwise straightforward set of results feel like an endless doom-scroll of trapped energy and lurking meltdown? The keynote is the basic strangeness ofArsenal, as we enter another staging point in a title race that is simultaneously gripping and tedious, and oddly tender in its contortions.Arsenal will probably win the league from here. They have the points, the squad and the fallible opponents. The only real certainty is that it will be agonisingly intense, the footballing equivalent of a silent scream. Not to mention hugely addictive. I for one am already pining for the game against Leeds on Saturday afternoon, which will be 0-0 at 60 minutes and from there dissolve into repeated clips of Mikel Arteta furiously whirling his arms on the touchline, a Lego-haired avatar of pain, dressed as ever in slickly generic black outdoor clothing, like an elite sniper on a fishing trip.There are some obvious answers as to why it feels like this. The most obvious is that what we are witnessing is a bottling. Simple stuff. A cowardice is taking place. Arsenal have to win the league, or they are basically betas, frauds, cucks, a papier-mache imitation of actual human men.Watching them try to create or play with fluency is like having your eyes slowly gouged with a blunt teaspoonThe thing is, bottling doesn’t really exist. It’s just a word. It’s outcome-based logic, Deeney’s paradox, thecojonesobsession, which confuses being good at football with being morally good and brave and right. Bottling is the absence of analysis.The burden of history has been mentioned, the long wait for a title. But that also feels too vague. These are hugely driven individuals from places such as São Paulo and the Basque Country. Kai Havertz may look like a minor royal cousin with a top-10 world croquet ranking but he has to be hard as nails just to operate in this rarefied air. Gabriel Magalhães is not feeling Perry Groves’s breath on his back.But something is clearly being done to them. Arsenal are top, but their leading scorer has five goals. Watching them try to create or play with fluency is like having your eyes slowly gouged with a blunt teaspoon. This is either a phase about to break, or a new way of playing, or a metric of future failure, expected non-goals in the final third of the season.The most interesting explanation is a parable of robotisation. Arsenal’s flaw lies in an overmechanisation of tactics. What we have here is the first post-human football team. This may be halfway to the truth. Arsenal are undeniably laden with data, from use of the StatDNA platform, to talk of an internal AI information bank, millions of data points used to predict not just injury and fatigue but game simulations, where to stand, where to pass, total set piece, mechanised attack patterns. Arsenal do express certain aspects of the modern world. There’s the feeling in his public pronouncements that Arteta is selling some kind of male wellness brand or restating his success vectors for the stakeholders. He even looks in these moments like an AI simulation of Handsome Earnest Football Man.View image in fullscreenMikel Arteta’s Arsenal express certain aspects of the modern world.Photograph: Andy Rain/EPASo is this it? Are we looking at a fatal flaw? Is this the hubris of robotisation? It sounds a little bogus. Fear of the future is as old as the future itself. People said this about television in the 1950s. They said steam train travel was impossible because humans would suffocate at such speeds. Artificial intelligence does sound frightening. But it’s not intelligent. It’s not even artificial. Its just a scraping of human thought-goo expressed in lines of code.It is part of the most obvious point of difference, however. Which is: scrutiny. The online life. Being seen, surveilled, constantly interfaced. People often wonder why things are happening the way they are. Answer: it’s always the internet. Populism, rage, polarised stupidity wars. Of course the world has gone off its axis. This is the most profound shift in human consciousness ever enacted, the creation of a global hive-mind, the ability to hear the thoughts, shouts and brain-blurts of every single citizen of Namibia from your bedroom in Brentwood.We are all terminally online now and this Arsenal team is the most extreme expression yet of this experience in sporting form. It comes in part from that internal scrutiny. Arteta is a massive data guy. Everyone at every level is tracked, statted, diced, sliced. How is this going to make you feel, or act, or perform complex movements? Mainly it is external. All fandom is online now, Arsenal’s particularly so, and in a way that feels unusually present. People have been talking about Arsenal bottling the league since September because content must always happen. There is an excess of feeling, micro-reasoning, total analysis, a complete absence of quiet space or places to breathe.This isn’t new but it is more intense from year to year. It is also the most overlooked factor in elite modern sport, the way being observed constantly will of course alter the experience. You can see this creeping into problems on the pitch. Arsenal need to create more, to be more spontaneous, to dance like no one’s watching. Go on. Do it while everyone is watching, while that white noise seeps into every pocket of your existence.How to fix this? Arteta conducted a tension-busting “face-meeting” with his players this week but even this has already become public product, put through the content wringer, mined for meaning. It brings us back to the burner identity. To succeed in the middle of all that heat and light has always been a matter of finding a still space, a bubble of silence. Never more so than now.If Arsenal do fall away this season it will in part be down to this new and entirely pervasive sense of static, a first terminally-online collapse from perhaps the most terminally-online team yet devised.Explore more on these topicsArsenalcommentShareReuse this content"

Those victories have lifted United to fourth, on 38 points, four points ahead of Fulham, and Carrick warned there would be no change of approach when Marco Silva’s side arrive at Old Trafford.“Tough game, tough challenge,” said United’s interim manager. “Marco has got Fulham into a really good team. Just because we are at home, taking anything for granted is bang out of order so it might be a case it’s the same flow of the game as the last two weeks. No shame in that, we will deal with the game in front of us and do whatever it takes to come out on top.”Joshua Zirkzee, who has returned to training after injury, has been linked with a transfer before Monday’s deadline. “I think Josh has just been trying to work to get fit and get back around the group and it’s been great to have him back training yesterday,” said Carrick. “That’s literally as far as it goes for me and for Josh. I’m looking forward to working with him. Nothing else needs to be said.”Carrick did confirm Patrick Dorgu will be unavailable for a prolonged period due to the muscle problem he sustained at Arsenal. “He’s disappointed, he’s had such a big couple of weeks,” said Carrick. “We weren’t sure whether it was a little bit of cramp or something more serious and at the moment it looks a little bit more on the serious, so it’ll be a few weeks for that. How many, we’ll have to wait and see.”Jamie Jackson2.No bad blood over Isak wrangle, says HoweEddie Howe is not expecting to welcome any new faces to his Newcastle squad before the transfer window closes on Monday night but travels to Liverpool on Saturday buoyed up by afine away performanceat the Champions League holders Paris Saint-Germain.That 1-1 draw on Wednesday night secured Newcastle a two-legged European playoff against Qarabag. It entails a long trek to Baku but Howe believes his team’s recent struggles on the road should be consigned to the past. “It was a high-level, elite, game in Paris,” he said. “My players showed their quality; we’ve proved how good we are away from home. We should have no fears now.”More immediately, Newcastle are seeking a first Premier League win at Liverpool since 1994, with Howe maintaining the bad blood provoked by Alexander Isak’s protracted £125m transfer to the Merseyside club last summer is forgotten. “We’ve moved on,” he said. “What happened is irrelevant now. We’re not looking back, we’re looking forward. There’s certainly nothing (animosity behind the scenes) on our side.”While Isak is sidelined by a broken leg, Newcastle’s captain, Bruno Guimarães, faces a fitness test on his ankle injury. Although Joelinton will be absent, Guimarães’s midfield sidekick appears weeks rather than months away from a return.“Joe flew to Barcelona for an injection into his groin,” said Newcastle’s manager. “And the specialist feels his return could be quite quick, we’re looking at weeks not months.”The full-back Tino Livramentois pencilled in to recover from hamstring trouble in time for a return in early March.Louise Taylor3.Fair to judge me on this season, says SlotArne Slot has said it is fair to judge him on a troubled second season at Liverpool and not his title-winning debut, with online abuse “part of the job” of being a manager in 2026.Slot has received fierce criticism on social media, a lot of it personal, and it reignited when his team’s 13-game unbeaten run ended at Bournemouth last Saturday. Even comfortable passage into the last 16 of the Champions League for a second successive season on Wednesday, courtesy of a 6-0 rout of Qarabag, did not spare Slot criticism, specifically in regards to one post-match comment.A reminder that Liverpool exited the Europa League quarter-finals against Atalanta two years ago, before sailing through the Champions League group two years running, landed Slot in trouble with the keyboard warriors.Rather than feeling entitled to more respect for winning Liverpool’s 20th league championship last year, the Dutchman accepts that he should be judged on the merits of the current campaign. Liverpool are sixth, 14 points behind leaders Arsenal, before facing Newcastle at Anfield on Saturday.“Maybe that has changed for managers, that even if you have won something there is still room for criticism, which to a certain extent is normal because we are in a new season and I was the first to say to the players: ‘We have to forget last season’,” said Slot. “So it is fair that people judge me on this season and not on last season.”“It is the part of the job, part of the thing we are living in,” Slot added. “What I meant [about the Europa League comment] was that season Liverpool ended up third in the league and we are currently sixth, so I didn’t want to make the point that was a poor season.“I only said we have achieved so much at this club but sometimes we also have to enjoy a moment like this. We cannot take those things for granted. For all the other things that are being said, that is what you have to accept if you are a manager that is not winning enough games.”Slot’s options are stretched for the visit of Newcastle on Saturday, though Ibrahima Konaté should return from compassionate leave and Curtis Jones is available after illness. But the head coach insists he is happy with the size of Liverpool’s squad and the club’s business model. “Everyone talks about £450m [being spent] but we had to recoup £300m [since 2024],” he said. “That’s our model and I am not frustrated about that. Maybe I am little bit frustrated that too many people don’t notice what our model is. That’s the model I stepped in to and I even embrace it. It’s a good model to have for any club.“We were able to achieve a lot of good things since this ownership is here with this model of sustainability. So we sold for £300m and bought £450m. But £250m we haven’t used yet – Alexander Isak, Jeremie Frimpong only a little bit and Giovanni Leoni not at all. That is the reality.”Andy Hunter4.Fulham sign Bobb for £27mFulham have completed the signing of wingerOscar Bobbfrom Manchester City on a five-year deal. The 22-year-old Norway international has moved to Craven Cottage in what is understood to be a £27m deal.Meanwhile, Pep Guardiola missed media duties before his side’s trip to Tottenham for personal reasons on Friday. The Manchester City manager was due to hold a lunchtime press conference to preview Sunday’s Premier League game but the club later confirmed the assistant Pep Lijnders would take his place.It comes after Guardiola gave a speech in support of Palestinian children at a charity concert in his home city of Barcelona on Thursday. The club said Guardiola was not present due to a personal reason. The Spaniard was expected to be back for training on Saturday.PA MediaView image in fullscreenOscar Bobb has joined Fulham from Manchester City in a £27m deal.Photograph: News Images LTD/Alamy5.Frank convinced Spurs owners ‘super committed’Thomas Frank talked up the “big commitment” of Tottenham’s owners despite a quiet January and insisted transfers were not as easy as Football Manager after they missed out on Antoine Semenyo. Spurs will face Semenyo on Sunday when Manchester City visit and Frank revealed the former Bournemouth attacker had been a big target for this winter transfer window before he decided to join Guardiola’s title-chasing side.With only days of the window left, Tottenham have signed Conor Gallagher from Atlético Madrid and the teenage Brazilian left-back Souza, but sold last season’s leading scorer Brennan Johnson and lost Mohammed Kudus, Richarlison, Rodrigo Bentancur, Ben Davies and Lucas Bergvall to serious injuries in January.It led Frank to acknowledge his current squad of players to choose from was weaker than at the start of this month, but he rejected any notion that the majority owners ENIC – run by the Lewis family Trust – were not committed to this project with Spurs down in 14th in the Premier League table.Before a daunting run of fixtures in February, which begins with the visit of City, Frank said: “I think we lost, I can’t remember, six or seven players inside three weeks in January? That’s crazy. There were definitely too many, so yeah of course [the squad] it’s weaker than we started the first of January.“I can promise that the Lewis family is super committed to this project. They want to do everything and I would go against my rule, hopefully only once, that there’s no doubt it’s clear that the club wants to sign Semenyo. They did everything. I think that’s a clear signal.Frank revealed a late call would be made on Micky van de Ven after he missed the impressive midweekvictory at Eintracht Frankfurtwith a “minor” injury, but Spurs could still be without eight players despite Pedro Porro and Richarlison being primed for a return at the end of February.PA Media6.Nuno believes Traoré can boost survival driveNuno Espírito Santo believes he can get the best out of Adama Traoré and that the “unique” winger can boost West Ham’s efforts to beat the drop after the manager was reunited with Traoré, having coached him at Wolves, rescuing the 30-year-old from a disappointing season at Fulham.“I’ve worked with him for many years, and I know him well,” said Nuno. “He’s unique – there aren’t many players with his ability one-on-one, or with his pace. He’s going to give us many things that we need. He possesses great threat, and he has great energy, not only on the pitch, but in the dressing room and at the training ground too. He’s a special person to have around. It’s not up to me to judge what’s happened to him before. I’m just happy to have him here.”The Hammers briefly closed the gap to 17th-placed Nottingham Forest to two points last weekend after beating Sunderland, but Forest responded a day later by winning at Brentford to leave Nuno’s side five adrift of safety going into Saturday’s trip to Chelsea. “We just have to focus on ourselves, and ignore what our opponents are doing,” Nuno added. “We have to try to compete well, play well, achieve results and keep going. We can’t focus on what the other teams are doing, because we can’t control that.”PA Media7.Rosenior reinforcements ‘must be right’Liam Rosenior said Chelsea are ready to move in the final days of the transfer window if the right players are available. The Blues are in the market for a central defender and have been optimistic that a deal for a long-term target could be reached before the end of January.A long-term injury to Levi Colwill which is likely to see him miss the whole season has left Chelsea short of options in the position, but it is understood no emergency cover is likely to be sanctioned with the club preferring to stick with their recruitment plans from before the England defender’s injury.The deadline for deals is on Monday night and Rosenior confirmed that the sporting directors Paul Winstanley and Lawrence Stewart are actively working on strengthening the team and are ready to back their head coach. “The guys are working hard to stay on top of things in terms of information on what’s out there, who’s interested in our players,” said Rosenior. “It’s about being prepared for any development.“My job along with the guys is to make the squad in every area as strong as it can possibly be. Certain players come up that you don’t expect to come up, and then can strengthen you. Whether that’s a striker or a wide player or a defender. If we see something, I know the guys are willing to do it. I don’t want to bring in players for the sake of bringing in players. There’s a possibility it could be busy, a possibility it could be quiet.”PA MediaExplore more on these topicsPremier LeagueThe talknewsShareReuse this content"

The EFL is assessing whether the bidders comply with the requirements of its owners’ and directors’ test (ODT).At the end of the season those assessments are being taken over by the Independent Football Regulator and it would pick up the Wednesday case if it has not been completed. The regulator also has the authority to assess incumbent owners, and has powers of investigation, sanction and enforcement more draconian than those of the EFL.The Bord/Roemer consortium has paid a multimillion-pound deposit to secure exclusive negotiating rights to buy Wednesday, and has provided evidence to the administrators, Begbies Traynor, that it has the funding to complete the proposed £30m-plus purchase and three years of operating costs.The sources of that funding are being analysed by the EFL, and the buyers’ involvement in gambling could complicate the takeover, with sources indicating due diligence is in its early stages. An EFL spokesperson said the ODT process was ongoing.Other clubs owned by gambling companies, notably Tony Bloom’s Brighton and Matthew Benham’s Brentford, have dispensation from the Football Association, which banned football betting for all participants in 2014. As part of that agreement Bloom and Benham allow the accounts of their betting consultancies, Starlizard and Smartodds respectively, to be independently audited on behalf of the FA to ensure they are not betting on football.Bord and Roemer would have to sign a similar undertaking, although it is unclear whether the FA would grant them dispensation. Bloom and Benham were club owners when the rules were introduced. The FA is understood to be liaising with the EFL.There is no public record of Bord’s wealth beyond reported career poker winnings of about £3m. The 44-year-old has worked for the data-driven betting businesses of Bloom and Benham, and multiple sources in the industry have described him as a successful gambler.View image in fullscreenJames Bord at a Dunfermline game. He co-owns the Scottish club.Photograph: Mark Scates/Mark Scates/SNSBord’s and Roemer’s advisers said that the Wednesday bid was being privately funded, with the pair having made money through investments in technology and analytics, but declined to go into more details.Roemer’s funding appears more clearcut through his ownership of crypto-gambling casino and sports betting site, Gamdom, an offshore operation registered in the Indian Ocean Comoros Islands.Bord also owns the Scottish Championship club Dunfermline with a fellow poker player, Evan Sofa, and has stakes in the Spanish club Córdoba and the Bulgarian side Septemvri Sofia with other investors.Bord’s other publicly known vehicle, Short Circuit Science, a data and analytics company, appears to be based offshore beacuse it is not registered in the UK or US. There are no public details of its staffing levels or business operations. Short Circuit had a contract with Sheffield United to advise on player recruitment last year until it emerged that Bord was bidding for Wednesday.Bord and Roemer beat off competition from six other bidders, including the former Newcastle owner Mike Ashley, to agree a deal to buy Wednesday after the club entered administration last October.Begbies Traynor is understood to retain confidence in its preferred bidder, but is aware of the ODT process make take considerable time, which led them to sell several players this month to ensure the club have sufficient cashflow to finish the season. The club captain Barry Bannan left for Millwall and Chelsea agreed to pay £500,000 for the 17-year-old defender Yisa Alao.Clive Betts, Labour MP for Sheffield South East, urged the EFL to run a rigorous process despite his desire for a sale to be completed.“The source of funding has to be a concern, given the inherent volatility of those industries,” Betts said. “Even if the EFL approves the takeover, what level of sustainability is there? These are issues that need to be addressed. I’m sure the regulator will be taking a close look, as even if they aren’t running the ODT they could inherit these owners. This is a massive test for the regulator. Given the nature of the bidders they will want to ensure there’s a thorough process, and it could take a long time.”Explore more on these topicsSheffield WednesdayFootball LeaguenewsShareReuse this content"

The Frenchman was on a Zanzibar beach, surrounded by a group of 10-year-old boys he had schooled in a kickabout that helped him rediscover his love of the game after a difficult start in Basel.Switzerland was next on Barry’s path after he had proven his talent in the Belgian second division at Beveren but it was not a smooth trajectory. “Two stupid red cards” in his first two appearances and failing to score in 16 Swiss league games left Barry needing to get away, so he headed to Africa and switched off his phone to enjoy the tranquillity of the Indian Ocean, a world away from football.David Moyes resigned to being without Jack Grealish for rest of Everton’s seasonRead more“I had played in Belgium and scored 20 goals, easy 20 goals, and then I went to Basel and when I went there I thought it would be easy to score there, too,” Barry says from Everton’s Finch Farm training ground before Saturday’s game at Brighton. “I found it was not easy. With the pressure and everything, I lost my confidence, I lost the love to play football – I lost everything. I saw some kids playing on the beach. My girlfriend said: ‘Go and play with these kids.’ I went and played and had a game. I was dribbling and just loved to touch the ball and when I came back to Basel I was like a different person.”Nine goals in the second half of the season caught the eye of Villarreal, where his 11 goals earned a£27m move to Merseyside. Talk of his time in Switzerland brings perspective for Barry, who endured another tough beginning in England, going 16 games without finding the net and failing even to register a shot on target until December. But David Moyes’s faith never wavered and the rewards are being reaped.Barry has four goalsin his past five Premier League games, helping Everton to 10th, four points off fifth.Years of rejection as a teenager fuelled Barry to fulfil his potential. He was not in an academy, joining Sochaux at 18 as a winger after failed trials with Clermont and Hamilton Academical, the former as a defender and the latter in central midfield, and has settled on being a striker only in the past two years. “When I was younger I never played as a striker, I always played centre-back, right-back, left-back, all the positions but not striker,” Barry says. “I don’t know why. When I went to Sochaux I started to play more attacking.“Because I wasn’t in an academy I arrived very late in football. I always do the next step because I dream big. Always my dad says: ‘Sometimes I think you are crazy, because always you talk and afterwards you have what you want.’ Like in a recent game, Jimmy [Garner] got man of the match and I said: ‘One day I hope you give me that’ and the next week he was presenting me with it. When I talk and when I want something I do everything I can to get it.”Barry, whose English is improving by watching Power on Netflix, remains his own harshest critic but, whether amid feast or famine in front of goal, his work ethic never relents. Everton fans appreciated his endeavour during the barren times, showing their adulation when he was substituted in the 13th game of his drought against Fulham, as they desperately sought a long-term solution to the problematic central striking role. “Sometimes it is not about a goal, but the sentiment,” says Barry. “My parents were watching the game and they heard the standing ovation. After the game my mum called me and said: ‘You see, the people love you. You need to give the love back.’ Good things come to those who wait.”View image in fullscreenThierno Barry’s second-half equaliser earned Everton a point against Leeds last Monday.Photograph: Jason Cairnduff/Action Images/ReutersIt is hard to imagine a dejected Barry, who has an electric smile and jovial demeanour. Everton are Barry’s fifth club in as many seasons, each in a different country, but the previous moves were stepping stones. Putting down roots with his girlfriend and nine-month-old daughter is the plan. “All the [previous] clubs, before we talk I said: ‘My dream is to play in the Premier League,’ so if I come here, it’s because I want to go to the Premier League, I want to prove here that I can play there. I think I want to do many years here, because it’s the best competition in the world.”Cutting corners is not part of Barry’s thinking. He employs a personal trainer, nutritionist, two physios and a chef. He can often be found in his garden playing out in-game scenarios, desperate to ensure every detail is covered. On his left wrist is inscribed Me v Me. “I got it in Basel,” Barry says. “When I did the first six months it was like my fault if I didn’t score, if I didn’t play good. The second part of the tattoo was when I played good I saw it as me against me. One day if I forget about things, I can remember by looking at this.”Barry knows there are few guarantees in football, and his fine run cannot go on for ever, but when the bad times almost inevitably return he has better coping mechanisms than most. Will he be seeking a kickabout on Formby beach the next time he loses love for the game? “I play with my little baby, so it’s OK,” he says with a beaming smile, having found the route to goal and happiness.Explore more on these topicsEvertonfeaturesShareReuse this content"

He made 89 appearances in the league, but 48 of them were from the bench and he was taken off 34 times. Having scored just 12 league goals in three years, he was nearly shipped off to Leeds in the summer.Fast-forward to today and he has become undroppable, starting 20 of Fulham’s 22 league games. Only four players have been involved in more goals than Wilson’s 12 this campaign – Erling Haaland (24), Igor Thiago (17), Bruno Fernandes (15) and Antoine Semenyo (13). Of those 12 goal involvements, 10 have come in his last 11 league appearances (six goals and four assists).The Welsh winger is the form player in the league and is increasingly the man Fulham turn to in big moments. When he stood over a free-kick in the 92nd minuteagainst Brighton last Saturdaythere was a hush over Craven Cottage and a strange sense of inevitability in the air. He stepped up, curled the ball into the top corner of the Brighton goal and turned a draw into a win.Delivering in big moments has become Wilson’s signature; without his contributions Fulham would be 12 points worse off this season. His eight goals have all been masterclasses in ball striking: from an audacious effort from the touchline at Spurs to his outside-of-the-boot finish against Palace that earned him December’s goal of the month. He has scored eight goals with an xG of just 3.81, giving him a +4.19 xG difference – the second highest in the league.Igor ThiagoIgor Thiago: ‘The only thing I know how to do in my life is score goals’Read moreFrombricklaying in Brazil to bullying centre-backsin the Premier League, Igor Thiago’s rise has been emphatic. Brentford signed him in the summer of 2024 to replace Ivan Toney, the club’s talismanic striker who scored 72 goals in 141 appearances, but Thiago’s first season was frustrating. Two knee injuries limited him to fleeting cameos and, by the time he returned to full fitness, he was filling a void that had grown larger with the departures ofYoane Wissa and Bryan Mbeumo, who scored 39 league goals between them for the club last season.Few expected him to carry that weight. Fewer still expected a player who spent his teenage years working manual jobs to support his family after the death of his father, laying bricks while chasing trials across Brazil, to become the focal point of aPremier Leagueside. Five months ago, the notion that Thiago would be chasing Erling Haaland for the Golden Boot would have been dismissed outright. But here we are, 23 games and 16 goals later.Thiago is the fourth-highest scorer in Europe’s top five leagues (behind Harry Kane, Kylian Mbappé and Haaland) and the top-scoring Brazilian. Carlo Ancelotti has some thinking to do before the World Cup.Antoine SemenyoAntoine Semenyo quit football when he was 15 years old. Rejected by Crystal Palace after a string of failed trials at Arsenal, Tottenham, Fulham and Millwall, he was convinced the dream was over and focused on basketball instead. But Semenyo returned to the game through a college programme, where his talent caught the eye and he was snapped up by Bristol City. He honed his craft during loan spells at Bath City, Newport County and Sunderland before tearing it up in the Championship.Bournemouth recognised his potential and paid £10m to bring him to the Premier League in January 2023. The player that Manchester City signed this month – powerful, direct, relentless in the press – took time to emerge. There were flashes of brilliance under Gary O’Neil, but it was during Andoni Iraola’s management that Semenyo became a star.The Ghana international hit double figures for goals in the Premier League last season and he began the current campaign with a bang, scoring twice at Anfield on the opening day. Since then, he has taken his game to another level, outpacing his expected goals by 4.36 (11 goals from an xG of 6.64), creating chances, carrying the ball at pace and terrorising full-backs on both flanks. He has attempted 78 dribbles (the seventh highest in the league), and he has taken 49 shots (the 10th most in the league).Defensively, he has been just as impactful, winning possession in the final third 18 times – the second most in the Premier League this season. “He has improved every single season,” said Cherries boss Iraola after Semenyo’s 10th and final goal for the club. “He has scored 10 goals in half a season and he’s not even a No 9.” He has already scored three goals in four games for City, further proof that the teenage reject was born for the biggest stage.View image in fullscreenAntoine Semenyo celebrates after scoring for Manchester City against Wolves.Photograph: Adam Vaughan/EPADominic Calvert-LewinNearly a decade has passed since a baby-faced Dominic Calvert-Lewin walked through the doors of Finch Farm. The striker joined Everton from Sheffield United for £1.5m on deadline day in August 2016 as a 19-year-old with heaps of potential.For a while it looked like a perfect match. Calvert-Lewin grew into the team and excelled for Everton after Romelu Lukaku’s departure to Manchester United for £75m. He reached his peak in the 2020–21 season when he scored 29 goals, but the momentum ebbed and injuries began to intrude. Just 12 goals in his last three seasons at Goodison Park left him drifting towards the margins.His contract came to an end and with it the closing of a chapter spent largely in physio rooms rather than opposition penalty boxes. The club seriously considered offering him one more chance to stay. Instead, Calvert-Lewin walked away, signing a three-year deal with Leeds.He was looking for a fresh start and he has found it. Calvert-Lewin has scored eight goals in his last 12 appearances and looks once more like the striker who earned 11 England caps. If this run continues, he might add more under Thomas Tuchel this summer.Jack GrealishWhenJack Grealish arrived at Manchester City for £100m in 2022, he was one football’s most exciting free-flowing forwards, a player who relied on improvisation and was shaped by risk and rhythm. Under Pep Guardiola’s guidance he enjoyed years of success, but also a period of subtle erosion.Grealish was moulded rather than unleashed at City. Danilo, a former City defender, once described Guardiola’s methods as “like being at university” where players were “brainwashed but in a good way”. Grealish became a willing student. His dribbles per game dropped by 40% in his first season and his freedom was exchanged for control. Trophies came in abundance – three league titles, the FA Cup and Champions League – but the Grealish of Villa Park, smiling and spontaneous, gradually slipped from view. And then he disappeared further, starting just seven league games last season. It felt as if the league had lost one of its brightest talents.Everton offered an escape route. He was joining a club that have been playing survival football for years. But Everton are no longer peering over their shoulder; they are playing with a certain degree of freedom under David Moyes – and Grealish has been handed the keys.His starting percentage is back up to the 75% mark he boasted at Villa and his impact has been significant. Grealish ranks third in the Premier League for assists (six); he has created 38 chances – more than any Everton player by a distance; and he recently scored his first goal from outside the box since November 2020 – a strike that was symbolic of his reborn confidence.“He’s been playing with a smile on his face again and he makes Evertonians smile,” said former midfielder Leon Osman, and it is hard to disagree. Hisinjury could not have come at worse timebut Everton fans will be hoping he extends his stay.This is an article byWhoScoredExplore more on these topicsPremier LeagueGuardian Sport NetworkfeaturesShareReuse this content"

They head to the Etihad Stadium on Sunday nine points behind their opponents and surely sensing that only a win could prevent the title from transferring to Manchester City’s outstretched arms.City have endured plenty of near misses since they last won the WSL 10 years ago, finishing second five times – or six, if we include 2017’s shorter Spring Series. They have frequently made it look as if “next year” would finally be their year, so there is something incongruous about their flourishing form arriving after they finished 17 points behind Chelsea last season.Chelsea’s WSL title hopes dented and City tighten grip on top spot – Women’s Football Weekly podcastRead moreSo strong has City’s reawakening been that, if they beat Chelsea, they would match the number of league victories they managed last season (13) with three and a half months left. It prompts the question: how have they transformed so quickly?Helpfully, they have avoided the extensive injury list that hindered them in recent campaigns and have also been able to focus on their domestic campaign because they are not playing in Europe. But it would be wrong to imply their upturn is merely down to being fresher. Their revival has been far more sophisticated than that.The club took their time in choosing a replacement for Gareth Taylor as head coach but, in Andrée Jeglertz, they appear to be in very safe hands. The Swede is bringing a soothing sense of calm to a high-pressure title race. He is consistent with his messaging and is saying all the right things in the media, never sensationalising, never overreacting and never doubting his players. After theirLeague Cup semi-final loss against Chelsea, he spoke of his full faith in the team and was rewarded with abounce-back win.View image in fullscreenThe relentless Khadija Shaw (left) celebrates scoring City’s winner at London City Lionesses.Photograph: Ben Whitley/PA“If the players are very happy, I need to be balanced; if the players are very disappointed, I need to be balanced,” Jeglertz said of his level-headed approach after last Sunday’s victory at London City Lionesses. “That’s the coach’s job: finding the balance all the time.” Sources close to the club have also described him as a thoughtful listener and praised his people management skills, saying he takes time to hear players’ views and communicates concisely and clearly.Alongside that, there is a determination that has rubbed off on City’s pressing and work rate – they have won possession in the final third more times than any other team – and their focus is exemplified by the fact they are yet to concede in stoppage time in either half or make an error leading directly to a league goal.City lead the way for set-piece goals in the WSL, suggesting the staff’s work in training is paying off, and they have scored nearly three times as many headed goals (eight) as any other team, which reflects another trait of this team’s style: they strive to whip crosses into the box, with Lauren Hemp and Kerstin Casparij the league’s top two for successful crosses.View image in fullscreenAndrée Jeglertz has brought a sense of calm to City’s squad.Photograph: Peter Byrne/PAOften on the end of those is the WSL’s runaway top scorer, the relentless Khadija Shaw, who has won nearly twice as many aerial duels as anyone else in the division. Consistency of selection has also been key, with no WSL team using fewer players than City. Shaw is one of five who have played in all 13 league games, alongside Casparij, Yui Hasegawa, Vivianne Miedema and one of the WSL’s most improved players, Laura Blindkilde Brown, who has started 12 of them and come of age.Alongside her, and able to push forward with a more attacking mindset this term, has been a flawless Hasegawa, who has completed the WSL’s second-highest number of successful passes in the final third, behind Arsenal’s Mariona Caldentey. Miedema has created the most “big chances” and Alex Greenwood is second with six. Their bench is usually full of gamechangers, too, with Kerolin having the best minutes-per-goal-involvement rate, at an average of one every 53 minutes, and Iman Beney adding further attacking depth.The 19-year-old was one of six summer signings and it has proven to be a strong period of recruitment, overseen by their director of football, Therese Sjögran, who – crucially, unlike many of her counterparts – has extensive experience working in the women’s game. She won more than 200 caps for Sweden but, perhaps more important, took this job after a strong spell as Rosengård’s sporting director. She, like Jeglertz, is a calming presence in what can be a chaotic world.There is also a strong spirit in this unified looking City squad. Sources close to the team have said that when players socialise they are doing so in larger inclusive groups, for team dinners for example, and that there have been no negative vibes.As Jeglertz has reiterated, they have a long way to go. The game against Chelsea is followed by a visit to Arsenal, so no one inside the club will be getting the champagne out just yet. Chelsea have beaten City in seven of their past eight meetings, but this time feels different. Rising from their lowest ebb, City are a team reborn. After languishing in fourth last term they look ready to go forth and win the league again at last.Explore more on these topicsWomen's Super LeagueManchester City WomenChelsea WomenWomen's footballfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Joshua Wood said he was infuriated after receiving a letter accusing him of breaching ground regulations by taking from under his seat an oversized banner at last Saturday’shome game against Sunderland.Protests have been held at many matches this season targeting David Sullivan, the largest shareholder, and Karren Brady, the vice-chair, and the anti-board sentiment was evident when a banner stating “Time 2 Sell – Name Your Price” was held up during the first half last weekend.Premier League: 10 things to look out for this weekendRead moreThe letter to Wood made no mention of the message on the banner. It said the 27-year-old was seen on CCTV breaching regulations related to items allowed inside the ground, which include a ban on “any flags or banners larger than those maximum dimensions permitted by the Club from time to time (or, in the absence of such stipulations, 2m x 1m) and/or of an offensive nature”.Wood, whose ban covers the next five games – two at home and three away – was informed that he was “observed reaching down to retrieve a banner which breached the permitted dimensions listed above”. Wood was told the club and the London Stadium had not received “prior notice from you or a request to bring a flag into the stadium to display at this fixture”.The club’s published sanctioning policy recommends a ban of up to three home matches for the possession of prohibited items. Punished individuals risk being unable to attend away games during that period.The letter to Wood does not state there is any video evidence showing that he brought the banner into the ground. Wood said he had no part in smuggling the offending item past security and had no idea whose it was. He said he and other fans had been asked to hold it up.Quick GuidePlay our new game: On the ballShowThe Guardian has kicked off a new chapter in puzzles withthe launch of its first daily football game, On the ball. It is now live in the app for both iOS and Android … so what are you waiting for? Get stuck in!Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.“I was informed when I was getting a beer in the concourse that a banner had been dropped off by our seats and someone wanted us to hold up a flag,” he said. “I’m not too sure who that was but we’re all protesting against the board so we were happy to do so. When I got down to the seat, there was a big roll of paper there. I didn’t even look at what was written on it. I just knew it was part of the campaign. I’m fed up so I was happy to voice my opinion.”Wood, a film-maker working on a project looking at how West Ham’s move from Upton Park in 2016 has hurt local communities, estimated that eight people lifted the banner.“They’ve been clever in how they’ve approached it because they’re not saying I’ve been banned for protesting,” Wood said. “They’re saying I’ve been banned for bringing up a banner which doesn’t fit the regulations of their dimension sizes. I have no doubt that if it said: ‘We love you, Brady and Sullivan’ we wouldn’t be talking today.” He plans to appeal.West Ham said they were unable to comment on a live investigation but are understood to dispute that the ban was an attempt to stamp out fan dissent. The club has made no attempt to thwart peaceful and lawful protest this season.It is understood Wood was deemed to be in possession of the banner because the footage shows him as the first person to pick it up. This was enough to constitute a breach of the stadium regulations.The banner was deemed to have posed a risk to supporter safety because it was larger than the maximum size allowed, had not been deemed fire retardant and was passed over the heads of other fans.The club accepted that other fans who came into contact with the banner simply held it while it was passed along the stand, and it was felt it would have been unfair to take action against those supporters.Explore more on these topicsWest Ham UnitednewsShareReuse this content"

The bean-counting boffins over at Transfermarkt reckon that Premier League sides have splurged a collective £300m on players, on course for the second-biggest January spend in the last 10 years (behind only the chaos of 2023, when Chelsea splurged £270m on their own). It doesn’t really feel like that, does it? Even the list of the top flight’s biggest outlays this month quickly descends into a cluster of players we’ve only heard of from Football Manager, if at all. If anyone can tell us who Brian Madjo, Rayan and Kaye Furo signed for without consultingBig Transfer Guide, you’ll win our much-coveted respect.A few memorable big-money deals aside, January is usually more of a bargain-bin scramble than a luxury shopping spree. The adage these days is that clubs only spend big in the winter if they’re in big trouble. While Manchester City and Aston Villa have bucked that trend, it’s worth noting that Arsenal, Liverpool, Manchester United and Newcastle are all yet to open their chequebooks/PayPal accounts at all this month.As football’s own Black Monday approaches, it seems likely that the Premier League’s more desperate members will take the headlines. West Ham have gone old school, signing two mysterious South Americans who have quickly revived their fortunes; above them, Forest, Leeds and Palace have shopping carts stacked but are struggling to get through the checkout. Palace began January by unveiling Brennan Johnson, in pictures that now summon a similar feeling to sepia shots of a gleaming Titanic moored in Southampton. The club looked set to signWolves’ wantaway strikerJørgen Strand Larsen (Premier League goals this season: one) for £50m, only for the deal to stall when – and we’re speculating here – Oliver Glasner found out about it and hit the roof again.For clubs seeking that elusive bargain, and players locked in WhatsApp chats with their agents, it could be a long weekend. Raheem Sterling has taken matters into his own handsby ending his Chelsea contract, while Harvey Elliott cannot join another European club this season – so the reduced aisle is down to Axel Disasi and a shop-soiled Kalvin Phillips. But let’s not give up hope of any more eye-catching moves just yet; after all, Charlton have just plucked Conor Coady from out of nowhere (or, as it turns out, Wrexham). Hibs striker Kieron Bowie is off to Serie A with Verona while Timo Werner, 29, has cashed in his chips and joined Bruce Arena’s San Jose Earthquakes. And let’s not forget Jack Harrison to Fiorentina, Andy Irving to Sparta Prague, Paddy McNair (still only 30) to Hull City, and Ryan Fraser to Western Sydney Wanderers. It may be an unedifying spectacle, but Panic Monday will always offer a few twists and surprises, fresh grist for the content mill. Just don’t expect your team to sign anyone that good, and you might enjoy it.QUOTE OF THE DAY“We confirm that the club has been served with court papers by its technical kit supplier, Macron S.p.A., in relation to a contractual dispute. The claim is being handled by the club with the support of its legal team, and it would be inappropriate to comment further while legal proceedings are ongoing” – Blackburn Rovers reveal their own kit supplier is taking legal action against them.RECOMMENDED PLAYINGThe Guardian has kicked off a new chapter in puzzles withthe launch of its first daily football game, On the ball.

A final decision will be taken in conjunction with his parent club,Manchester City, but under the terms of last summer’s loan move – which will cost Everton in the region of £12m – there is no option to cut the deal short.“These situations [whether to operate] would normally be taken over by the parent club. I think that at the moment we’re going to probably control most of Jack’s situation.” said David Moyes. Asked whether Grealish could return to City early, the Everton managed replied: “No. And you wouldn’t for the money.”Grealish has been revitalised at Everton following a difficult period at City, producing six Premier League assists, but the finances required for a permanent transfer mean he might have played his final game for the club.Everton have an option to buy Grealish for £50m this summer, when he will have only 12 months remaining on his City contract, but Moyes insisted it was “far too early” for a long-term decision. He wants to add to his squad before Monday’s transfer deadline with a right back and striker on his wish-list. Moyes admitted the club have been trying to sign a new right-back for over a year without success, and while he wants to improve the squad in this window, Everton’s owners, The Friedkin Group, may prefer to wait until the summer.“I think the club have got a little bit of that,” said Moyes on waiting for the summer window. “I would like to improve, I don’t want to miss any opportunity where I can improve Everton. I get it that we’ve got to remember we are just out of financial problems, so if anybody is out there thinking we are going to spend £40m on somebody then we are not in that place at the moment.“That’s not to say we couldn’t do it in the summer, but I don’t think we are really in that place yet. But if I have my way, I think we need to. And obviously losing Jack Grealish as well is a big blow to us regarding limiting our attacking options.”Everton could replace Grealish with Chelsea’s Tyrique George. The left winger is available on loan and has attracted interest from several Premier League and European clubs.Explore more on these topicsEvertonManchester CitynewsShareReuse this content"

The Italian club have offered a deal worth up to £35m for the 28-year-old, who has made no secret of his desire to leave to further his ambitions of a World Cup call-up in the summer.Men’s transfer window January 2026: all deals from Europe’s top five leaguesRead morePalace are believed to be considering the offer, having received a £35m bid from Forest last week that they have yet to respond to. They would prefer not to sell to a Premier League rival. Mateta has indicated that his preference is to move to Serie A and has agreed terms with Milan on a three-and-a-half-year deal.Glasner said Mateta would not travel with Palace to Forest, who are interested in the Manchester City goalkeeper Stefan Ortega, but could not say whether Mateta had played his last game for the club.“It’s nothing to do with the transfers, he is just not in the right place and doesn’t feel in the right place to play,” the manager said. “It makes no sense. I have to protect the team and that is why he will not travel with us to the game. There’s so much noise and speculation – you need every single payer at his best, and JP isn’t at his best right now with all the noise that happens. If somebody has some private issues that he can’t really focus on football then it makes no sense to play him because then he can’t help the team or perform on the top level.”On Friday night Palace confirmed the completion of a loan move for Aston Villa’s Ivory Coast forward Evann Guessand, with the option to make it a permanent deal in the summer. But talks with Wolves over Jørgen Strand Larsen remain on ice, with Palace yet to formalise their verbal agreement to sign the Norway striker for £45m, plus £5m in add-ons.His potential arrival is thought to depend on Mateta leaving but there are believed to be concerns among the Palace hierarchy about paying such a fee, which would smash the club’srecord of £35m spent on Brennan Johnsonthis month.Palace have had two bids for Sidiki Cherif rebuffed by Angers and the 19-year-old striker has informed the French club he would rather join Fenerbahce. Glasner, asked whether he expected any further arrivals before the deadline, with a central defender to replace Marc Guéhi also on the agenda, said: “The club is working almost 24 hours a day. You can imagine it’s not so easy at the end of January but I see the club working really hard to get players in. But to be clear, it can be that JP stays and is still a Palace player on 2 February or it could be that JP has left and we have a new striker at the club.”West Ham are considering a move for Southampton’s Taylor Harwood-Bellis. Nuno Espírito Santo wants a defender before the transfer window shuts and has identified Harwood-Bellis, who has one England cap, as an alternative to Chelsea’s Axel Disasi.West Ham have looked ata loan deal for Disasibut Chelsea are trying to find a buyer for the Frenchman, who has not played this season. Harwood-Bellis was relegated with Southampton last season.

It followed reporting from the Telegraph that theCricketRegulator is investigating the 26-year-old, Jacob Bethell and Josh Tongue over their conduct that evening. It was also reported that all three were fined by the England and Wales Cricket Board.Breakdown in cricket relations with Bangladesh rings alarm bells for India’s Olympic bidRead moreIn the statement, sent to the media after England’s victory against Sri Lanka inthe opening Twenty20 internationalin Pallekele, Brook said: “I accept responsibility for my actions in Wellington and acknowledge that others were present that evening.“I regret my previous comments and my intention was to protect my teammates from being drawn into a situation that arose as a result of my own decisions. I have apologised and will continue to reflect on the matter. This has been a challenging period in my career, but one from which I am learning.“I recognise that I have more to learn regarding the off-field responsibilities that come with leadership and captaincy. I remain committed to developing in this area and to improving both personally and professionally.”Brook was involved in the altercationduring his first away series as England’s limited-overs captain and reported the incident midway through the ODI defeat the next day in Wellington. News of the incident did not break until after the Ashes, with the ECB stating that it dealt with the matter “through a formal and confidential disciplinary process”.The batter accepted last week that he was fortunate still to be England captain. Brook said: “Even if I had been sacked, I’d have held my hands up and said: ‘Look, I’ve made the mistake,’ and I’d have been perfectly fine with getting sacked from the job as captain, as long as I was still playing cricket.“I think I’ve got a little bit of work to do to try to regain the trust of the players. I said sorry to them yesterday. I felt like I needed to say sorry for my actions. It’s not acceptable as a player, but as a captain it’s really not acceptable to do what I did in New Zealand. I’ll be the first person to say that. I hold my hands up.”Brook’s U-turn comes as he prepares to lead England at the upcoming T20 World Cup, their campaign beginning next week against Nepal in Mumbai. They began their tour of Sri Lanka with a 2-1 ODI series win in Colombo,Brook hitting a match-winning century in the decideron Tuesday. He finished unbeaten on 16 in the T20 series opener on Friday asEngland won by 11 runs on DLS.Explore more on these topicsEngland cricket teamHarry BrookCricketnewsShareReuse this content"

Abdusattorov was the clear leader, but he has drawn three and lost one of his last four games.Leading scores after 11 of the 13 rounds are Abdusattorov and Sindarov 7, Matthias Blübaum (Germany), Jorden van Foreest (Netherlands) and Hans Niemann (US) 6.5, Vincent Keymer (Germany) 6, Yagiz Kaan Erdogmus (Turkey), Gukesh Dommaraju (India), Vladimir Fedoseev (Slovenia) and Anish Giri (Netherlands) 5.5.View image in fullscreen4009:Le Quang Liem v Aldiyar Ansat, World Blitz 2025. White to move and win.Erdogmus, 14, has already set multiple age records. He is the best 12-, 13- and 14-year-old in chess history. He is the youngest ever 2600-rated player, and is now closing in on the 2700 mark, where he would beat the previous records set by China’s Wei Yi at 15 years nine months and Magnus Carlsen at 16 years four months.He has a wealthy sponsor, and is coached by the elite GM Shakhriyar Mamedyarov. His playing style is a well-organised mix of strategy and tactics, and he has already played the “Turkish Immortal” game at the 2025 Fide Grand Swiss. Erdogmus looks increasingly like a player who will dominate world chess in the 2030s.On Wednesday, for a brief moment, it could have been even better. Inhis game with Gukesh, Erdogmus missed a beautiful hidden win at move 28 which would have taken him into a share of the tournament lead and also made him the youngest ever to defeat a reigning world champion.Erdogmus has his own characteristic stance when seated at the board, which the commentator Simon Williams called his “death sway”. Long ago in the mid-20th century, the English master and author Gerald Abrahams had a similar action, but he swayed from side to side in a Talmudic shuckling movement that was irreverently nicknamed the “runaway rocking horse”.As for Gukesh, he has become a player of ups and downs. The most crushing down was against Abdusattorov.View image in fullscreenGukesh Dommaraju blunders against Nodirbek Abdusattorov at Wijk aan Zee.Gukesh blundered fatally by 36…Rg5?? allowing 37 Qxf6+ and 38 Qxg5+, winning a rook with check. The decisive moment wascaught on video, as the grief-stricken Indian buried his head in his hands and could not bear to look at the board.Two days on, after also losing his next game then winning in fine stylein round eight, Gukesh took a more philosophical view. He said: “I cannot explain what happened. These kinds of blunders are easier to handle than something you can explain. So this just happens. Shit happens!”The worst ever blunder by a reigning world champion was probably when Vladimir Kramnik allowed checkmate in one by the computer Deep Fritz intheir 2006 match, played during the few years when humans and chess engines were of approximately equal strength.After 11 of the 13 rounds in the Challengers, whose winner qualifies for the 2027 Masters, four players have broken clear of the field: Andy Woodward (US) leads with 8.5, followed by Aylin Suleymanli (Azerbaijan) and Vasyl Ivanchuk (Ukraine) 8, and Marc’Andria Maurizzi (France) 7.5.

The masterful leg-spinner took three for 19 as Sri Lanka’s batting lineup collapsed in the first of three Twenty20s, losing five wickets for 22 runs.Sam Curran celebrated a late ­hat-trick, too, as the visitors were set a target of 134 in a rain-shortened contest after the start was delayed. They were guided by Phil Salt’s 46, but Tom Banton’s 15-ball 29 provided the real thrust, easing the tension in the middle overs.Harry Brook adds to England woes by admitting he lied about nightclub incidentRead moreEngland were just about stumbling over the line when the rain returned with nine needed off 12 balls, the crowd filtering out before the official decision. Harry Brook’s side lead the series after winning by 11 runs on DLS, but the joy will be limited among the tourists. In a statement released by Brook after the match he admittedhe was with teammates on the night of his bouncer altercationin New Zealand. The fallout refuses to stop.The Pallekele InternationalCricketStadium – the venue for this entire 20-over series – was a lush sight before the start: green banks flank the field, screensaver hills dominate the backdrop. But unseasonal rain complicated things, chalking off six overs before the first ball.England had named their XI the night before, including the fit-again Jofra Archer for his first appearance since the third Test of the Ashes. Brook chose to bowl first, gave his premier quick the second over, and there were positive signs after a month away: Archer began with a toe-hunter, got the ball leaping past Kamil Mishara’s outside edge and nearly had the left-hander caught at midwicket, the leaping Liam Dawson unable to hold on.But the opening passage belonged to Sri Lanka, with Curran struggling to find the right spot. After conceding 16 off the first over of the innings, he returned for the seventh and was laid into by Kusal Mendis for 20 more. Even the left-armer’s new weapon, the moon ball, did not bring joy, Mendis sending a 50mph change-up down the ground for six.As ever, England looked to Rashid for some beard-stroking wisdom. He combined with Dawson’s twirl to ignite the middle-order implosion: 76 for one became 98 for six. Rashid looped the ball up to invite three fatal slogs, but his working over of Dhananjaya de Silva, dismissed for 11, was the standout. The 37-year-old began his final over with three dots as De Silva failed to decode the googly. A mistimed sweep to Curran in the deep followed.View image in fullscreenPhil Salt goes on the attack as he leads England to victory in the opening T20.Photograph: Eranga Jayawardena/APDasun Shanaka, Sri Lanka’s recently reappointed T20 captain, provided some resistance with his 20, but Curran returned to rewrite the tune of his day. Shanaka and Maheesh Theekshana failed to clear the boundary when going down the ground before Curran went full, straight and lit up Matheesha Pathirana’s stumps. The Surrey all-rounder conceded his runs at close to 13 an over; he also became the second man to take a T20 hat-trick for England, after Chris ­Jordan in the 2024 World Cup.This was Salt’s first time taking on Sri Lanka, a surprising stat for an opener with more than 80 caps for England, but he was his usual self, bludgeoning Theekshana’s box of tricks for 14 off his first three ­deliveries. As Jos Buttler began Eshan Malinga’s first over with four consecutive boundaries, it seemed England were on for a quick one. But Malinga replied with a delicious variation, his off-cutter hanging in the air to bowl Buttler.Jacob Bethell advanced to nine before he was also undone by Malinga’s change of pace, the slower ball chipped to extra cover. When Salt, on 17, swatted Wanindu Hasaranga towards deep midwicket, the collapse seemed to be on. But Mishara spilled a simple chance and Banton calmed the situation in his first innings of the tour, punishing Hasaranga with consecutive reverse-slaps, the first for four, the second travelling all the way. The Somerset batter’s takedown was key in leaving a simple equation at the drinks break, with 48 required off the last 48 balls.Banton could not finish the job, smashing the impressive Pathirana to cover, and Brook was suddenly exposed, Hasaranga’s googly not letting him settle. But Sri Lanka’s clinical touch was missing, Pathirana denied the wicket of Brook when another catch went down, this time at deep cover. The slingy right-arm quick conceded just 18 off his four overs, setting his marker for the next two games. But Sri Lanka’s errors in the field proved costly.Explore more on these topicsEngland cricket teamSri Lanka cricket teamTwenty20CricketnewsShareReuse this content"

There was also a 24% increase in referrals of under-30s.Recent cases included perpetrators using wearable tech such as smartwatches, Oura rings and Fitbits to track and stalk women, disrupting their lives through smart home devices that control lights and heating, and using AI spoofing apps to impersonate people.Emma Pickering, head of the tech-facilitated abuse team at Refuge, said:“Time and again, we see what happens when devices go to market without proper consideration of how they might be used to harm women and girls. It is currently far too easy for perpetrators to access and weaponise smart accessories, and our frontline teams are seeing the devastating consequences of this abuse.“It is unacceptable for the safety and wellbeing of women and girls to be treated as an afterthought once a technology has been developed and distributed. Their safety must be a foundational principle shaping both the design of wearable technology and the regulatory frameworks that surround it.”Refuge said it was far too easy to access and weaponise smart accessories and that women’s safety needed to be factored into their design.One survivor Refuge worked with, Mina, leftbehind her smartwatch in a rush to flee her abuser, who then used it to track her by using linked cloud accounts to locate her emergency accommodation.“[It] was deeply shocking and frightening. I felt suddenly exposed and unsafe, knowing that my location was being tracked without my consent. It created a constant sense of paranoia; I couldn’t relax, sleep properly, or feel settled anywhere because I knew my movements weren’t private,” she said.Despite police returning the device to Mina, she was located at her next refuge by a private investigator hired by her abuser, using suspected tracking via technology. She reported the breaches to police but was told no crime had been committed because she had “not come to any harm”.“I was repeatedly asked to move for my safety, rather than the technology being dealt with directly or the smart watch being confiscated from him. Each move made me feel more unstable and displaced,” she said.“Overall, the experience left me feeling unsafe, unheard, and responsible for managing a situation that was completely out of my control. It showed me how tech abuse can quietly and powerfully extend coercive control, and how easily survivors can be left to carry the emotional and practical burden when systems don’t fully understand or respond to it.”Abusers were also increasingly using AI tools to manipulate survivors, Pickering said. For example, they might alter a video of the survivor so that she appeared drunk, enabling them to tell social services that “she’s acting erratic again, slurring speech, she’s got a drink problem” and that she was therefore an unfit mother or a risk to herself and others. “We’ll see more and more of that as these videos and applications advance,” Pickering said.Pickering said she had also heard of AI tools being used to develop authentic-looking fraudulent documents, for example job offers or legal summons, which can be sent to survivors to make them believe they are in debt, or to persuade them to turn up to the same location as their abuser.Pickering feared that in coming years, medical tech would increasingly be misused, for example by controlling insulin levels through a diabetes tracker, which can be fatal.She urged the government to act on digital technology-enabled and online crimes, including providing more funding to develop and train digital investigations teams. “They want short-term wins, they don’t want to think about longer-term investment in this area, but if we don’t do that we’ll never get ahead,” she said.She also wants to see the technology industry held to account for failing to ensure devices and platforms are designed and function in ways that are safe for vulnerable people.“Ofcom and the Online Safety Act don’t go far enough,” she said.A government spokesperson said: “Tackling violence against women and girls in all its forms, including when it takes place online or is facilitated by technology, is a top priority for this government.“Our new VAWG strategy sets out how the full power of the state will be deployed online and offline. We are working with Ofcom to set out how online platforms tackle the disproportionate abuse women and girls face online.”Explore more on these topicsViolence against women and girlsDomestic violenceAI (artificial intelligence)WomenSmartwatchesSmartphonesSmart homesnewsShareReuse this content"

It also urged the establishment of a licensing regime in the UK allowing publishers to negotiate with tech companies over the use of their content in AI news.“If AI companies are going to profit from journalism and shape what the public sees, they must be required to pay fairly for the news they use and operate under clear rules that protect plurality, trust and the long-term future of independent journalism,” said Roa Powell, senior research fellow at IPPR and the report’s co-author.The IPPR said work on licensing could begin with the UK’s competition regulator using its new enforcement powers over Google. The Competition and Markets Authoritythis week proposedgiving web publishers and news organisations the power to stop Google scraping their content for its overviews. Collective licensing deals would ensure a wide range of publishers were included, the IPPR added.Google’s AI overviews now reach 2 billion users a month and approximately a quarter of people use AI to get information, according to the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism.Copyright law should remain unchanged to ensure a licensing market grows, said the IPPR, while the government should encourage new business models for news that are not dependent on the tech sector, including supporting the BBC and local news providers.“With the right policies in place, the government can shape this market so that UK news organisations transition their business models for the AI age andAI companies improve the reliability of their products by drawing on trusted sources,” said the report.IPPR tested four AI tools –ChatGPT, Google AI overviews, Google Gemini and Perplexity – by entering 100 news-related queries into those platforms and analysing more than 2,500 links produced by the AI responses.ChatGPT and Gemini did not cite journalism by the BBC, which has blocked the bots they use to assemble answers, while overviews and Perplexity used BBC content despite the broadcaster’s objections to those tools using its journalism.The IPPR found the Telegraph, GB News, the Sun and the Daily Mail were cited in fewer than 4% of answers on ChatGPT, while the Guardian – which has a licensing deal with ChatGPT’s parent,OpenAI– was used as a source in nearly six out of 10 responses. The Financial Times, which also has a licensing deal with OpenAI, also featured highly. The Guardian was also the most common source used by Gemini, appearing in half of all answers.Google’s use of AI summaries at the top of search results has affected click-through traffic for publishers, with a knock-on effect for their revenues, because many users read the overview without moving on to the original journalism.The IPPR said questions needed to be asked about how financial relationships between AI companies and news providers shaped answers.“If licensed publications appear more prominently in AI answers, there is a risk of locking out smaller and local news providers, who are less likely to get AI deals,” the report said.IPPR added that while licensing deals could replace lost advertising revenues to an extent, they would not maintain a healthy news ecosystem. They could make news organisations dependent on tech giants for revenue and that income could easily disappear if copyright protections are weakened, said the thinktank.The IPPR said there should be public funding to create new business models for investigative news and local news, whose sustainability could be threatened by the rise of AI news, and for the BBC to “innovate with AI”.An OpenAI spokesperson said the company was “committed to supporting quality journalism”, adding: “When ChatGPT searches the web, it draws from a broad range of publicly available sources relevant to the question and displays citations and direct links. This helps users verify information and drives traffic to publishers.”Explore more on these topicsAI (artificial intelligence)NewspapersNewspapers & magazinesComputingOpenAIChatGPTGooglenewsShareReuse this content"

Could I finally best her?Fri 30 Jan 2026 05.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 30 Jan 2026 11.45 ESTShareMy mother bore me. My mother nurtured me. My mother educated me. She has a resilience unmatched, a love all-forgiving. She is the glue that holds our family together. But right now, I am kicking herassat video game bowling, and it feelsgood!In the 00s, my mum was the best Wii Bowling player in the world. She was unbeatable. Strike after strike after strike. The Dudette in our family’s Big Lebowski. So when she said she was coming to visit us in Canada, I thought the time was right to buy the updatedNintendo SwitchSports version of her favourite game. She’s 76 now, and I might finally have a chance of beating her, I thought, especially if I allowed myself a cheeky tune-up on the game before she arrived.I fire up Nintendo Switch Sports to get the lay of the land. Tennis and golf have survived the almost 20 years since Wii Sports, along with bowling. The tennis has nothing to keep me entertained for longer than 10 minutes, and I have been terrified of any golf game where you swing a controller since Christmas morning 2009, when my wife surprised me with Tiger Woods PGA Tour Golf for the Wii and I surprisedherby throwing my back out after a six-hour session on it.View image in fullscreenDominik Diamond (right) and his family play Wii Bowling in 2006 with great intensity.Photograph: Dominik DiamondVolleyball and badminton are a double serving of meh. Little kids might find them fun, but not this big one. Basketball has been carried over from Wii Sports Resort, and Chambara is an updated version of fencing. The latter is every bit as chaotic as the original, the former is still a car crash: the hand motion that you have to use to move and dribble is one that I haven’t vigorously practised since I was a teenager. And I don’t want to do it in front of my mother.If basketball is a fender-bender, then the new football game is a multi-car pileup. It’s a slower, less entertaining version ofRocket League, but one that allows you to strap a controller to your leg to virtually kick the ball. There is no way a 56-year-old man should try to kick something that doesn’t exist. You may as well take a pair of scissors to your hamstrings.However, just like Wii Sports before it, Switch Sports is worth every penny because of the bowling.It is the very essence of gaming fun and simplicity, which is great because we were all drunk when we had our first session. Three generations of Diamond family silliness. It was beautiful.Mum wasn’t without criticisms of the new version. The updated Mii characters are too realistic; she preferred the quasi-abstract shape of the Wii originals. And she is deflated that the Switch just says “spare” rather than “NICE SPARE!”Her biggest criticism is the size of the Joy-Con controllers compared with the Wii remote.“I am happier with something bigger in my hands,” she cackles.She is incorrigible. I know where I get it from.The next day it was just my mum and I, playing sober. It was a very different kind of gaming, social and laid-back; we talked about how she fell in love with this game during a Christmas at my house back in 2006. My brother was there, with his kids, and my sister-in-law was visiting from Canada. I have zero recollection of this, so thank goodness I have an elderly mother to help me remember things in my dotage.‘I wouldn’t have the life I have had without her’ … Dominik Diamond plays on his mum’s ZX Spectrum.Photograph: Dominik DiamondShe loved it so much that when she returned home, she immediately bought her own Wii. It lives and breathes to this day, with all the plastic adornments you got with Wii Sports – the one and only game she has ever played on it.Introducing her to her favourite game feels like a repayment, because my mum was the one who got me into gaming. She had gone back to school to train as a word processing teacher in the 80s and had an interest in programming, so she bought a ZX Spectrum to learn BASIC – but she never had a chance, as us kids hijacked the machine to go Manic Mining. Yup. Our Atic Atac addiction stopped our mum from essentially becoming Brenda Romero.Mum claims she introduced me to the “game” that changed my life. Mavis Beacon Teaches Typing. She has a point. I type crazy fast, because of Mavis. We reminisce about the last-minute calls to her theatre school when we were short of audience members for GamesMaster, and the joy she felt when I got athletes to wave hello to her on the telly.I wouldn’t have the life I have had without her.I hope that my kids get me over for a games night when I am 76, so they can finally best me at Street Fighter II, when my arthritic thumbs can no longer pull off a Dragon Punch. And then I hope that their kids do that with them, and this glorious circle of gaming life continues.I am so happy to have this time with her to play games again. But I’m even happier for the space we fillaroundthe game, the memories we continue to create. A week after she left, I booted up bowling again, but I only played for 10 minutes before I switched it off. It just wasn’t the same without Mum.Explore more on these topicsGamesNintendo SwitchFamilycommentShareReuse this content"

He never backs down for longJonathan FreedlandWhether it’s Minneapolis or Greenland, the US president will do just enough to get through a damaging news cycle, then carry on as beforeFri 30 Jan 2026 12.08 ESTLast modified on Fri 30 Jan 2026 14.20 ESTShareDon’t be fooled. When it comes toDonald Trump, what might look like a full retreat is almost always a mere tactical withdrawal, designed to buy time. He’ll step back when he’s forced to, under pressure, but will then revert the instant the pressure lets up. Too often, his opponents, whether at home or abroad, allow themselves to be played, confusing a mere pause for a surrender – and the risk is strong that they’re making that same mistake all over again.This week, the US president won praise in some quarters for moving to “de-escalate” the war he has been waging on the people of Minneapolis. Following thekilling of Alex Pretti, an intensive care nurse who posed no threat and yet was shot at least 10 times by masked agents of Customs and Border Protection or CBP, Trump signalled that hewanted to calm things down.Heshipped out the manwho had become the face of the campaign of terror conducted by both CBP and Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, Gregory Bovino, a buzzcut cliche of a villain whose chief mission appeared to be the generation of “content”, specifically images of himself strutting around Democrat-led cities like the general of an occupying army, right down tothe SS-style greatcoat.Next, Trump subjected his homeland security secretary, thepuppy-killingKristi Noem, to an emergency Oval Office meeting, from which his chief domestic policy adviser and the architect of the anti-immigrant purge, Stephen Miller, waspointedly excluded. To complete the picture, Trump spoke to Democratic leaders in Minnesota, later saying that he and they were now on“a similar wavelength”.That he felt compelled to make these moves is testament to the depth of revulsion prompted by Pretti’s killing. Video footage, as well as the dead man’s biography, made a mockery of the administration’s initial claims thatPretti was a “would-be assassin”bent on staging a “massacre”. In Pretti, as withRenee Nicole Good, the armed agents of the state had picked the wrong victim, someone Team Trump could not plausibly cast as “a domestic terrorist”, though that didn’t stop them trying.Two are dead in Minneapolis. Trump is to blame | Kenneth RothRead moreThe citizens of Minneapolis have also defied the script Miller and Trump wrote for them. They have refused to play the role of crazed urban mob, triggering the riot that would have handed Miller, in particular, the pretext he seems to crave to invokethe Insurrection Act, thereby allowing the White House to use the full force of the US military to crush domestic opposition. Instead, Minneapolitans have acted nonviolently, monitoring ICE rather than confronting it, armed with nothing more menacing than whistles.These facts have reached the US public, despite the White House’s efforts to shape an alternative, wholly false, reality. Credit for that goes to the reporters, and camera-wielding citizens, who have ensured that Americans, and the rest of the world, can see what ICE and CBP are doing. Plenty will have a specific image or detail they can point to as the one that proved too much to bear. For some, including voters who may well have once approved of Trump’s plans to crack down on illegal migration, it will have been the sight ofa terrified five-year-old boy, wearing a Spider-Man backpack, taken into custody by armed agents.For my own part, it was learning that, because thousands of people in Minneapolis have not left their homes for days for fear of being picked up, or worse, by the masked men of ICE, volunteers have taken todiscreetly delivering bags of groceries to their door. That leapt out because, as I discovered in the research for my bookThe Traitors Circle, a handful of dissident Germans used to perform the same act of kindness for the hidden Jews of Berlin under the Third Reich.Outrage that such deeds are necessary in the US of 2026 would not, on its own, have done enough to shift Trump. What proved more decisive was the misstep by several of his underlings, who argued that Pretti had made himself a legitimate target by carrying a firearm. That instantlyincensed the gun lobby, which is usually reflexively pro-Trump, but which has also long insisted on the right to bear arms, including at demonstrations.The nature of the Trumpians, asspelled out this month by the former White House strategist Steve Bannon, is to drive ever deeper until they meet resistance. When that resistance is the rock of the Maga base, and that rock cracks, they stop drilling.But, remember, it’s only ever a pause. The instant the pressure eases, normal service resumes. Having talked of de-escalation on Tuesday, Trump was back threatening Minneapolis’s Democratic mayor on Wednesday, warning him that he was“playing with fire”by standing in ICE’s way. On Thursday, Trump was asked if he was pulling back in Minnesota. “No, no. Not at all,” he replied. Later that night, federal agentsarrested ex-CNN anchor Don Lemonon charges relating to his presence at a protest at a Minnesota church earlier this month. Meanwhile, for all the earlier talk, both Noem and Miller remain in their jobs.In other words, there is no pivot. ICE is continuing to buy upwarehouse-style “mega” detention facilitiesfor the tens of thousands caught in its dragnet. And all the usual Trumpian excesses continue. Late in the week, the president filed a lawsuit against the Internal Revenue Service, seeking$10bn compensation for the leak of his past tax returns. Considering that he oversees the IRS, the decision on whether to settle the case by paying Donald Trump billions of dollars of taxpayers’ money will ultimately be made by … Donald Trump. I would say his chances are pretty good.The pattern is clear. Trump will do just enough to get through a damaging news cycle, wait for it to pass – then carry on as before. We saw the first half of that manoeuvre last week, which began withthreats to seize Greenlandand ended with those threatsseemingly withdrawnunder international and domestic fire. Nato and European leaders probably thought they’d seen off the danger. But this week Trump’s Greenland envoy was back demanding“total, unfettered access”to the island, so who knows what his boss might say next week.This is why I worry aboutthe deal struck late on Thursday by Senate Democrats, which saw the latter agree to keep funding the US government, thereby avoiding another shutdown, rather than withholding the cash until Trump meets their demands to “rein in” ICE. Now there will be two weeks of talks. The fear is that Democrats have let slip their moment of maximum leverage, when public outrage at ICE and CBP was at its peak, and will instead see the current anger fade. They will have walked right into Trump’s trap, as spelled out by the administration official whoadmittedthat this week’s “de-escalatory measures” were designed to placate Senate Democrats just enough that they failed to seize the moment.The lesson for those battling Trump, whether Democrats or nervous allies overseas, is not to celebrate an apparent climbdown too early. Instead, you resist until he retreats and, when he does, you don’t relax – you push even harder.Jonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionMinnesota ICE shootingsTrump administrationICE (US Immigration and Customs Enforcement)US politicscommentShareReuse this content"

It turns out chumminess with the president might just come at a costFri 30 Jan 2026 09.36 ESTLast modified on Fri 30 Jan 2026 13.55 ESTShareWhowasn’ton the red carpet at the officialMelania documentarypremiere in Washington DC was so much more intriguing than who was. No offence to defence secretary Pete Hegseth, but if I wanted to see formalwear struggling to containCrusades tattoos, I’d hang around outside theSpartak MoscowChristmas party. Not that it was a red carpet, because the carpet at the “Trump-Kennedy” Center was black. No one bothers hiding the grift any more, with the movie’s own producer openly explaining that this aesthetic was “all about supporting this luxury brand that [Melania’s] creating”. They should have dressed the event like a colon, since Donald’s is effectively where it was being held.Anyway: arrivals. There was Melania and Donald Trump – she finally got him out of hair and makeup – who were holding hands, a coincidentally convenient way to cover his skin if his glam squad didn’t truck in enough concealer. In recent months, Trump has had terrible bruises on the tops of his hands and even moreterrible excusesfor why they keep appearing.Aspirin, Swiss furniture, shaking lots of hands – the list of things that aren’t cannula sites grows longer every week.But how heartbreaking to look at the parade of henchmen and their out-of-towner wives and realise that there was absolutely no sign of Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sánchez Bezos. What happened? Not only did Jeff’s Amazon pay hysterically over the odds to license and market the film, but he and Lauren have never met a red carpet they didn’t love. Certainly since shemanscaped himandcouples-dressed himand told him that that boring vanilla thing he did drove her wild. For the couture shows earlier this week, Lauren and Jeffrolled into Parislike Panzers – and were received with as little resistance – but were nowhere to be found at the premiere on Thursday night.Could it be that the techlords are starting to realise what they got into with Trump? Take another of their number, Apple’s Tim Cook. As mentioned previously,MLK superfanTim spent the night of the latest Minneapolis execution at Saturday’s White House screening of Melania. If he thought he got away with it, that impression was swiftly dispelled by reaction to the online photo of him posing with Melania director Brett Ratner. Oof. This is why leading industrialists should always insist on a no-Instagram rule in the chancellery.But they haven’t, and this stuff does keep leaking out, unhelpfully for them. Erstwhile action director Ratner has nothing to lose, of course, which is why this is the first documentary he’s ever made, unless he once put a hidden camera in a women’s bathroom or something. OK, fine. Legally, I am required to state that Brett Ratner has never been accused of such a thing. That said, the sheer number of baroque allegations against him at #MeToo’s height was hard to keep track of. The actorOlivia Munnsaid she was sent to his trailer to find him furiously masturbating with one hand and holding a prawn cocktail with the other. (Ratner denies etc.) Olivia is currently starring in Apple’s hitYour Friends & Neighbours, so no doubt she was thrilled to see that her big boss Cook turned out to the White House last Saturday. Certainly, enough Apple employees of one level or another lost their shit sufficiently for Tim torelease a statementcalling for a “de-escalation” in times he’s expected to clink glasses with sex cases for presidential favours. Sorry – a de-escalation in tensions in Minneapolis.Someone who knew once told me about how being one of Putin’s oligarchs worked. Every now and then you got a call from the Kremlin saying you needed to fork out and take this or that company or problem off the state’s hands. You put the phone down, swore a bit, and did what you’d been asked. It was sort of a turn system, and it would be one of the other guys’ turns next time round. Last summer it was Tim Cook’s turn, with Apple being railroaded intomassively boostingits domestic supply chain spend. This time round, it must have been Jeff’s turn – but the Amazon founder seems to have judged that spending the price of an empty mining concession in the Urals on a Melania doc was enough.As for how the film will do … hate to break hearts, but my bet is that Melania has a really good opening weekend for a documentary. As well it might, with those financial tailwinds. But the idea that no one in the US – obviously its key market – is going to see it is wishful thinking. How many tickets it sold at the Vue in Bolton just isn’t the deal many would like it to be.Furthermore, there’s always another way to spin the numbers. House speaker Mike Johnson said of Amazon last night: “I think they will make money on this film. But it also has an inestimable value for its cultural impact … I think it transcends dollar figures.” Yup, this thing is Maga’s One Battle After Another –miles off breaking evenat the box office but it gets over some hazy line on prestige metrics. Or asThe Rock bristledover another crappy Amazon film he was in: “Red One has a long shelf life with multiple verticals, kudos to our Amazon partners for their strategic win, that’s just getting started.”But the worry for the techlords must be that the increasingly erratic Trump is only just getting started with them. Whose turn will it be next? You’ve heard plenty about tipping points this week – but the big one will be when the cost of doing business starts to really cost these guys business.Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsMelania TrumpOpinionAmazonJeff BezosTim CookDonald TrumpcommentShareReuse this content"

Now is the time we must start paying attention to another highly damaging part of ICE’s arsenal: the agency’s deployment of mass surveillance.I’m referring specifically to Mobile Fortify, a specialized app ICE has been using at least sinceMay 2025. (Usage of the app was first reported last June by404Media.) What is Mobile Fortify? It’s an app for facial recognition that can additionally take “contactless fingerprints” of someone simply by snapping a picture of a person’s fingers. The app has been used more than 100,000 times, including onchildren, as alleged in alawsuitfiled by the State of Illinois and the City of Chicago. And it’s dangerous.After taking someone’s picture, an ICE agent can now scan for that person’s face or fingerprints in a host of government databases that reportedlyincludemore than 200 million images. The agent will immediately obtain vast amounts of information on that person,includingname and date of birth, possible citizenship status, names of family members, markers like alien registration numbers and much more.From worst of times to even worse: the Trump administration continues to spiral | Sidney BlumenthalRead moreICE is reportedly using the app on people itsuspectsof being in the country without authorization, but this presumption comes with its own host of problems. (ICE is alsobelieved to bescanning random people of color on the streets to determine citizenship.) Representative Bennie G Thompson, the ranking member of the House homeland security committee, told404Mediathat ICE considers “an apparent biometric match by Mobile Fortify [to be] a ‘definitive’ determination of a person’s status and that an ICE officer may ignore evidence of American citizenship – including a birth certificate – if the app says the person is an alien”.It gets worse. In a document obtained by404Media, the governmentadmitsthat “it is conceivable that a photo taken by an agent using the Mobile Fortify mobile application could be that of someone other than an alien, including US citizens or lawful permanent residents”. No one, citizen or non-citizen, is allowed to opt out, either. And, as the document states, “[e]very new photograph or fingerprint, regardless of match, is an encounter and stored and retained inATS[Automated Targeting System] for 15 years”.Fifteen years is an absurdly long time to retain such data. As a point of comparison, the TSA’s use of facial recognition is optional, and the agencysaysit deletes photographs after verification has been made. Then again,testimonyduring a 21 January hearing revealed that the TSA has been assisting ICE by checking passenger information for immigration enforcement operations.This kind of technology is clearly not limited to the US. In Gaza, the Israeli military has also widely employed facial recognition to conduct mass surveillance, and it’s been used to identify and detain Palestinians, asreportedby the New York Times. The Times also reported that the “technology struggled” in its mission, so the military began supplementing their search results by using Google Photos. Is there a connection between theextremely intrusive mass surveillance of Palestinians in Gazaand the mass surveillance happening on our streets? Put another way, are we too being transformed into overly surveilled subjects, likePalestinians in the occupied territories?Today’s facial recognition tools are often roundly criticized for their inaccuracy, as they should be. Such occurrences are legion. Facial recognition has always been better at identifying white men than other people. One 2018studyled by a researcher at MIT found the maximum error rate in facial recognition software for light-skinned men was 0.8%. The error rate for darker-skinned women was 34.7%.And the consequences of such biases are real. In New Jersey in February 2019, Nijeer Parks waswrongly arrestedfor stealing a candy bar and attempting to run over a police officer. He did nothing of the kind, but Parks, who is Black, was misidentified by the police’s facial recognition software. He ended up spending 10 days in jail and almost 10 months being prosecuted for a crime he didn’t commit. (Parks issuingthe Woodbridge olice department.)Last October, ICEtwice misidentified a womanwhile using Mobile Fortify in Oregon. Agents snapped pictures and queried the app two different times, and each time the app returned a different incorrect name for the same person.So bias is certainly a real problem, but wrong results are really only the tip of this techno-authoritarian nightmare we’re now facing. The technology will almost certainly get even more sophisticated and as the tech improves, it’s possible these systems will become more accurate. Yet, the core problem will remain because precision is not the real issue.No other organization in American society can wield power the way the government can. The government is entitled to take your money through taxation, take your liberty through a criminal legal system and even take your life through legally sanctioned execution. The check on this enormous amount of power is that the people retain the right not only to create and recreate the government through elections, but also to challenge the government through (what should be) an independent arbiter found in the courts.But when the government knows almost everything about you, can track virtually all your movements, can create networks of association based on those it assumes are your friends, and can gather this information without seeking authorization from the courts and can retain the information for years on end, simply by aiming a phone at you, then the next logical step is that this same government will use that information to predict what you will do and what you will think.And what’s to stop that same government from using this information to intimidate those it deems as dissenting or even just insufficiently patriotic? The unchecked, centralized accumulation of citizen information creates the architecture for authoritarian rule. Just ask the former East Germans. This is why, in a democracy, it is the people who hold the right to privacy and the government which must operate in public. It cannot be the other way around.Elaine Scarry, an American philosopher, recognized this very fact more than 20 years ago, after the USA Patriot Act, the key piece of legislation of the “war on terror”, was passed. It is the “war on terror” that has laid the infrastructure for the mass surveillance society and the imperial presidency we have today. “The Patriot Act inverts the constitutional requirement that people’s lives be private and the work of government officials be public,” Scarrywrote. “It instead crafts a set of conditions in which our inner lives become transparent and the workings of the government become opaque.”Privacy, we should note, is not the same thing as secrecy. In fact, privacy is more fundamental. Privacy is a vital part of being human. The human capacity to make some things public while keeping other things private is key to learning how to trust others, how to build community and how even to develop ourselves. So when a government eliminates the privacy of its people, it is in effect removing part of each person’s humanity. Privacy is “the foundation of moral autonomy and liberty”, Scarryexplained. “Inhabitants of a country who lose the guarantee of privacy also eventually lose the capacity for making friends and the capacity for political freedom.”With the killings of Renee Nicole Good and Alex Pretti, the last month has shown us that stopping ICE from shooting civilians in the street is an imperative if we want to save the lives of innocent people. What should also be clear now is that stopping ICE from shooting pictures of us through apps like Mobile Fortify is just as necessary if we also want to save our democracy.Moustafa Bayoumi is a Guardian US columnistExplore more on these topicsICE (US Immigration and Customs Enforcement)OpinionSurveillanceTrump administrationcommentShareReuse this content"

Broadway numbers like Springtime for Hitler in The Producers and, more recently, Das Übermensch in Operation Mincemeat, a showstopper performed with a German techno beat and Nazi boyband – “Third Reich on the mic” – vocals, present fascism as an essentially camp enterprise and we’re reminded this week that ICE fits the mould entirely.It’s always about the costumes, isn’t it? Here’s border patrol chief,Greg Bovino, swishing around Minnesotain his long, green trenchcoat– as Gavin Newsom, the governor of California put it, “as if he literally went on eBay and purchased SS garb” – while rank and file ICE agents were described by Keith Ellison, Minnesota’s attorney general, as prancing about in “full battle rattle”. The vests, the fatigues, the goggles; I swear most of these goons are only in it for the accessories and an opportunity to admire themselves and each other under cover of rugged co-combatant team spirit. Meanwhile, as Lydia Polgreen pointed out in the New York Times, their sheer incompetence adds a darkly slapstick layer to events via videos of, for example, large men dressed for war slipping on ice and going “ass over teakettle”.If you laugh in their faces you run the risk of being shot, but there’s nothing to stop it going on behind their backs. If I were an editor in New York I would send someone to Broadway to report on how recent events are affecting audiences at Operation Mincemeat – specifically, how they react to a line that passed unremarked in the London West End production, but has been stopping the show in the US: “If people like us just blindly follow orders, the fascists won’t need to bash the door down. They’ll have already won.”Friends who saw the show two weeks ago reported that the performance ground to a halt at this line as the entire theatre rose to its feet, screaming and clapping. One can only imagine how long the interruption is now.TuesdayJust when you think the world can’t get any more disappointing, here’s Nicki Minaj on stage withDonald Trump, supporting him at an event in Washington DC and declaring herself “probably the president’s number one fan”.Well, this a blow from the artist who gave us the lyric: “My anaconda don’t want none unless you got buns, hun.” Although it does, of course, usher her into the long, tawdry tradition of When Good Cultural Icons Go Bad. From Kanye to Roseanne and the enduring disappointment of David Mamet, whose swing to the right was a particularly bitter pill given he wrote the greatest line in stage history (“coffee is for closers,” from Glengarry Glen Ross). Still, if we got over the loss of Kelsey Grammer, we can get over Minaj.Thank God for lovely Deacon Blue, who, while on tour in Australia this week, were informed that Reform UK’s “first Scottish leader”, Malcolm Offord, had approvingly referenced their 1987 hit Dignity while making a speech in Glasgow. The Scottish band promptly issued the statement: “It appals usto see the lyrics of any of our songs being used to bolster a campaign and ideology which is completely at odds with what the song, and we as a band, believe.”A bit crushing for Offord, one imagines, who said he liked the song “for the message of working hard and saving up to make your dreams come true”, but was hazier about how, under a Reform government, a dinghy called Dignity sailing up the west coast would probably be stopped and turned back by UK border patrol.View image in fullscreen‘Of course she didn’t bring any snacks.’Photograph: Jumeau Alexis/Abaca/ShutterstockWednesdayFor some light relief from world events I just finished reading Murderland: Crime and Bloodlust in the Time of Serial Killers, by Caroline Fraser. The brilliant, fascinating, genre-defining book was published last year and posits that lead poisoning in the Pacific north-west caused the huge spike in serial killers in that region in the 1970s. It sounds bizarre, but Fraser is completely convincing and it’s beautifully written to boot. After the book, I turned to what feels like a companion piece, David Fincher’s Mindhunter on Netflix, which covers the same ground from the perspective of the FBI’s first serial killer profiling unit. (And, fun fact, it features Anna Torv, an actor I love who also happens to be Rupert Murdoch’s niece).The only downside to all this American grimness – 496 pages of murder followed by two seasons of more murder – is trying to readjust to daily life. I went down to my bin room this week to throw out the recycling and had to focus very hard on not picturing Ted Bundy, back from the dead and naturally hiding behind my bins, poised to jump out and get me.View image in fullscreen‘Manchester’s a long way that way, don’t worry about it.’Photograph: Carl Court/ReutersThursdayTo the Australian Open, where the first week was dominated by Naomi Osaka’sEdwardian jellyfish outfitand the second has been all Coco Gauff’s. The 21-year-old American and world No 3 was knocked out of the quarter-finals by the 31-year-old Ukrainian Elina Svitolina – a stunning upset, but not the main story from Melbourne.Backstage after the match, Gauff was caught on camera unawares as she repeatedly smashed her racket into the ground, trashing it with the methodical rhythm of someone hammering a nail into the floor. The fact it was 44C in Melbourne probably didn’t help her mood, and at the press conference afterwards she explained calmly that it was better for her to release her frustration in private – as she believed herself to have done – than courtside in front of young fans. In fact, Gauff’s actions strike me as the inadvertent provision of a public service. For anyone over-invested in the news cycle,watchingthe racket smash on repeat may prove cathartic.FridayIf the Golden Globes two weeks ago were mostly bleached of politics, Sundance this week made up some of the shortfall with “ICE Out” badges being worn by famous attenders, including Natalie Portman, Olivia Wilde and Zoey Deutch. A more useful list of names, perhaps, is that of thepeople who attendedthe other big-screen event of the week: the launch of Amazon’s Melania documentary at the White House. While Minneapolis burned, these people showed up to support Donald Trump: Eric Yuan, the head of Zoom, Lynn Martin, the president of the New York Stock Exchange, and Tim Cook, the chief executive of Apple.

Then a keto diet gave me my life backNatalie MeadIt took six years to identify the condition that caused my chronic pain: a blood sugar dysregulation conditionFri 30 Jan 2026 06.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 30 Jan 2026 11.47 ESTShareSeven years ago, when I was 27, I got my first-ever migraine. Ten months later, it was still there.Even after the 10-month migraine ended, frequent weeks-long migraine attacks and bouts of stabbing “icepick” headaches kept me in pain more often than not. I was a software engineer at Facebook, but had to take leave from work because looking at my laptop screen made my head scream in revolt. I would never go back.Instead, over the next six years, I’d be hospitalized four times for chronic migraine disorder, the most disabling form of migraine disease, which is the second most common cause of disability globally. Chronic migraine involves, among other things, having a headache for 15 or more days per month. I’d also try all of the available medications for migraines despite their side-effects and begin avoiding bright lights, loud noises and a long list of foods that other chronic migraineurs told me could worsen my pain including gluten, tomatoes, dairy, bananas, certain varieties of onions, lemons, olive oil and anything aged – including leftovers.Early on, I visited one of the country’s top-ranked neurology practices, looking for answers. My MRI, CT scan and bloodwork were all normal, yet clearly something was wrong. But the neurologist insisted this was the end of the road.“You’re thinking of migraine like a virus, or a broken bone,” he said, “but it’s actually a Pandora’s box. And you’ve, unfortunately, already opened it.” By this he meant that my chronic migraine disorder, now unleashed, couldn’t be reversed.This doctor’s opinion was, I would soon discover, the prevailing one within the American medical establishment. Though episodic migraine – the much more common form of migraine disease – is also incurable, it can usually be managed into remission through a combination of lifestyle changes and pharmaceuticals. Chronic migraine, however, is widely considered incurable in another, much more damning sense.As the theory goes, chronic migraine is the result of a nervous system gone awry. It supposedly starts when neuroplasticity – the brain’s ability to rewire itself – snowballs into central sensitization, awidely researched phenomenonin which the nervous system is stuck in an overactivated state. This overactivated state creates migrainesex nihilo– or, at least, absent of any other physiological trigger. These migraines then sensitize the nervous system even more. In other words, it’s a pain doom loop.Central sensitization is why every chronic migraineur I’ve ever known has been told to stop fighting and accept their disease. Doctors and therapists told me to accept my migraines because there is noone-size-fits-all treatment for central sensitization, and what’s more, a hyper-sensitive nervous system can easily turn emotions like anger and fear into additional pain. This is true of other chronic pain conditions, and something I experienced first-hand (getting angry about my pain would almost always spike me to a 10 on the pain scale).Choosing to practice acceptance was one thing, but being told to do so – by medical professionals, no less – felt like being told to give up. Was I really expected to live the rest of my life like this?But acceptance seemed to be my only option, until almost a year ago, when I met Dr Kyle Bills, a neuroscientist and the founder of the Migraine and Neuro Rehab Center in Provo, Utah.“These, I think, are the problem,” he said as he pointed out sawtooth zigzags on a graph of my blood sugar readings. My migraines, it seemed, were the result of metabolic irregularities. For the past month, I’d been wearing a continuous glucose monitor that logged my blood sugar every few minutes, and each migraine episode I’d had while wearing it correlated with a rollercoaster-like spike and dip.I was stunned, and more than a little angry, though not at Bills. I was angry because I’d seen so many doctors over the past six years, even traveled across the country to a well-regarded headache specialist, but had always been told to just try a different medication or procedure. Because chronic migraine was an irreversible Pandora’s box, no one had thought to investigate possible non-neurological causes. In fact, I’d often been told that such causes either didn’t matter, or didn’t even exist.The condition that caused my chronic migraines was not central sensitization but postprandial hypoglycemia, a blood sugar dysregulation condition. In his peer-reviewed case-controlresearch study recently published in Frontiers in Neurology, Bills identified similar blood sugar dysregulation conditions in the majority of chronic migraine participants.Though Bills doesn’t deny the role that central sensitization eventually plays in migraine “chronification”, his research does refute the theory that chronic migraines are caused by a glitching nervous system. He instead posits that chronic migraine begins when ongoing blood sugar dysregulation events overwhelm the hypothalamus, the part of the brain that triggers insulin release.My first thought, upon hearing this: does this mean chronic migraine, contrary to what I’d been told, was reversible?Bills’s recommended remedy for my postprandial hypoglycemia was the ketogenic diet. Using keto to treat chronic migraines is actually not much of a stretch, as keto is already widely used totreat epilepsy, a condition that, like migraine, involves a sort of“electric storm” in the brainthat can temporarily inhibit brain function and cause inflammation. Though Bills’s most recent study isn’t about treating migraine with the ketogenic diet, this will be the focus of his future work.After I followed Bills’s advice to do a three-month medical keto diet to reset my metabolism, my migraines were no longer chronic. Though I still get occasional migraine episodes, they are infrequent and not nearly as severe. Most of the “triggers” I’d spent years avoiding also aren’t triggers any more, and though I can’t go crazy with my refined sugar intake, I’ve returned to eating a pretty normal diet – a diet that allows me to occasionally eat pizza for dinner, for example – without relapsing into postprandial hypoglycemia.Given that I still have what qualifies as episodic migraines, it would be wrong to say that Bills has cured migraines in general. But his discovery of what makes migraines turn chronic is a huge medical mic drop, as it proves that chronic migraine – a disease that affects approximately 2% of the global population – can be, in some cases, cured.When I told a pain-scientist friend about being one of the few people who have recovered from chronic migraines, she said: “I have the utmost respect for what you’re going through, but – you’re wrong.” Because she viewed chronic migraine as caused by central sensitization, my experience couldn’t exist in her world. In the end, we agreed to disagree.I’ve been in remission for 10 months now. I don’t know if I’ll relapse, or when – though Bills’s discovery is poised to shift the entire conversation around chronic migraine, at this stage, there are still more questions than answers. But getting my life back, regardless of how long I get to keep it, was enough to give me what I needed most: hope. Which is, as the story goes, exactly what remained behind in Pandora’s otherwise-emptied box.Natalie Mead publishes a Substack called Oops, My Brain about life with chronic illness and recovery.

Since federal immigration agents flooded the region weeks ago, daily life has been destabilized in ways residents say feel unprecedented.The president’s super-sized immigration force has now killed two people in the Minneapolis metro area since “Operation Metro Surge” began in December. Nearly three weeks after an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agent shotRenee Nicole Goodin the face, armed federal authorities on 24 January killedAlex Pretti, a 37-year-old Veterans Affairs nurse, who witnesses say was trying to intervene after seeing agents treat another person harshly.Multiple witnesses described Pretti’s killing as sudden andunnecessary. Ilhan Omar, a congresswoman from Minneapolis,saidthis “appears to be an execution by immigration enforcement”. Other representatives from the state, such as Omar Fateh, a Minnesota state senator, used the same language. Pretti, along with Good and the Los Angeles residentKeith Porter Jr, have within the last month become the latest tolose their livesbecause of ICE.The Minneapolis revolt tells us this: even in Trump’s America, the people have power too | Aditya ChakraborttyRead moreSince “Operation Metro Surge” began, schools have reportedsteep attendance drops. Businesses have shuttered or reduced hours. Residents avoid public spaces. Civil rights groups say federal agents have turned daily life into an occupation, appearing at schools, places of worship and grocery stores while detaining people at traffic lights and bus stops. Federal authorities detained at least two children in the area whose families were seeking legal asylum, using five-year-oldLiam Ramosas bait to lure his family outside – his father was apprehended – and detaininga two-year-old girl.The disruption has even affected the operation of local government. Brian O’Hara , the Minneapolis police chief, warned that ICE’s tactics were “obviously not safe”, complicating local policing and public safety coordination – and a suburban police chiefcomplainedICE officers were stopping off-duty officers of color. Hospital workerstoldthe New York Times agents were “barging into patient care areas trying to question or detain patients”. Employers reportsudden labor shortages. Mutual-aid networks have had toreplace everyday services, public or private, just so that immigrant families can get groceries and medicine without fear of capture.What we’ve been watching inMinnesotais proof that racist ideas lead to racist policies – and those policies produce bad, dangerous governance that affects everyone. Grievance governance does not stay confined to its targets; it corrodes the state itself. Hatred cannot govern a country effectively.Minneapolis is home to thelargest Somali populationin the United States. One of Trump’s fiercest congressional critics,Omarwas born in Somalia. The president has found a convenient bogeyman in one of the world’s mostconflict-affected and displacedpeoples.Rather than acknowledge their humanity, Trump has called Somali immigrants “garbage”, deemed Somalia one of several “shithole countries”, and recently suggested Somalis “destroyed” Minnesota. His administration recently moved toroll backtemporary protections for Somalis. The president also weaponized a rightwing influencer’ssensationalized claimsabout Somali-run daycare centers to justify a federal surge.Trump has also described migrants as “animals” and claimed they are “poisoning the blood” of the nation. His administration targets cities with large Black, Latino, Asian and Indigenous populations while attacking diversity initiatives as discriminatory.His lieutenants echo him. Top aide Stephen Miller haslong arguedimmigration reshapes the nation’s identity for the worse. JD Vance, the vice-president, has warned of Europe’s “civilizational suicide” through immigration andamplified false claimsabout Haitian migrants in his (and my) home state of Ohio. What we are witnessing now is not rhetorical excess – it is rhetoric translated into state power, and even death.Demographic panic is now being expressed not just with votes, but with federal badges and firearms. To boot, in a letter released this week, Pam Bondi, the attorney general, warned Minnesota officials that federal operations would continueunless the state turned over voter-registration data.The line between immigration enforcement and electoral coercion is collapsing in real time. That isn’t just chaotic; it’s democratically destabilizing.History tells us why. Racial grievance has repeatedly served as American statecraft: a way to fracture democratic coalitions, justify coercion and translate prejudice into policy.After Reconstruction, white supremacist elites balanced racial terror with laws that legitimized segregation and fractured working-class alliances. TheSouthern Strategyrefined racial grievance as electoral politics. The “war on drugs” replaced public health with punitive spectacle, producing mass incarceration without solving addiction.Grievance politics is not just morally corrosive, but also institutionally incompetent. Government is supposed to work for all people, and a racist one works for none.New analysisby Tom Wood, a political scientist at Ohio State University, shows that in 2024, lower-income white voters were more likely to back Trump than wealthier whites, a historic reversal of class-based voting patterns. Grievance now outperforms material self-interest in American elections. In American politics, resentment now routinely beats material interest – and governance pays the price.A year into Trump’s second presidency, the toll is human andeconomicalike. More Americans appear to be noticing. AGuardian analysisof his first year back in office shows immigration enforcement surged while job growth softened and household electricity prices rose despite campaign promises. Approval ratings have slipped,even among Republicans.By operationalizing bigotry, this president is not making the country safer. He is making it smaller.We must be organized, coordinated, and unrelenting as we sift through the rubble to build something better. Resistance and reconstruction are not mutually exclusive. In a democracy under strain, they are inseparable.Jamil Smith is a Guardian US columnistExplore more on these topicsMinnesotaOpinionMinnesota ICE shootingsMinneapoliscommentShareReuse this content"

It’s up to us to replace it responsiblyMark SurmanWhen bubbles burst, what comes next can be better, if we build it differentlyFri 30 Jan 2026 06.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 30 Jan 2026 06.06 ESTShareIt was December 1999. Tech investors were riding high, convinced that a website and a Super Bowl ad were all it took to get rich quick. Spending was mistaken for growth; marketing was mistaken for a business model. In just a few months, the dot-com boom would go bust:$1.7tn in market value vanished, and the broader economy took a $5tn hit.Yet something remarkable emerged from the wreckage. The post-crash internet wasn’t defined by speculation, but by creation: the rise of web 2.0 and open-source software – and the birth of platforms like Firefox and Wikipedia. The lesson is simple: when bubbles burst, what comes next can be better, if we build it differently.Today, history is repeating itself – this time with AI.The AI boom looks eerily familiar. Nearly 80% of stock gains in 2025 are concentrated in just seven companies – Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla, all of whom are vying for control of the full AI stack that will underpin our shared future –hardware, software, data, energy and infrastructure.This isn’t just about market share, it’s about who decides how billions of people learn, create and see the world.AI needs to augment rather than replace humans or the workplace is doomed | Heather StewartRead moreThat level of concentration should worry us all.And like the dot-com days, valuations are rocketing without clear paths to profitability. Companies are selling the fantasy that AI will replace human workers, even though95% of AI experimentsinside firms fail to reach production. And instead of building public-interest tools that expand human potential, much of the industry is generating what Cory Doctorow calls“productive residue”– a flood of synthetic media, misinformation and deepfakes.The problem isn’t AI itself; it’s the current economic logic behind it.This is not inevitable. It’s the result of an economic model that treats technology as an extractive industry – hoarding data, consolidating power and externalizing harm. The AI arms race is driven not by innovation, but by domination, favoring profit over humanity.A different economic model already existsThe good news is that an alternative model already exists. Around the world, open-source developers and mission-driven companies are building shared infrastructure for trustworthy AI – transparent, auditable and locally adaptable. They are proving that innovation need not depend on monopolistic control of data.This is evident in the companies leading the way, the founders building tools that are both values-driven and competitive. Companies like Hugging Face, which runs the world’s most widely used open-source machine-learning model and dataset hub; Flower AI, which enables decentralized, federated learning to challenge the dominance of centralized big models; and Oumi, which offers a fully open-source platform for building and deploying custom AI models on local infrastructure rather than closed clouds. And many more.These aren’t speculative bets; they’re seeds for a more sustainable, pluralistic tech ecosystem. It’s part of what we view as a double-bottom-line economic model for tech – an approach that values missionandmoney.Slop is not destinyIf history is any guide, the current frenzy will end the same way the dot-com boom did: with a crash. But that’s not the end of the story – it’s the beginning of a new one.In the last bubble, theLinux stack, the open-source building blocks that now underpin almost everything the internet, rose from the ashes to beat Windows. Open-source building blocks like these have createda stunning $8.8tnin value over the last two decades, withnew research estimatingtens of billions in value to startups and other businesses if they switch from closed AI platforms to open-source models.How much value can we create today? It’s enormous.When the AI bubble pops, we’ll face a choice. We can rebuild the same monopolistic model, or we can use the moment to design an economy that’s pro-human and values-driven. That means open models, transparent governance and equitable participation in the value AI creates.It also means focusing on what people actually want from technology: privacy, security, agency and joy. The promise of AI isn’t its infinite scale – it’s the ability to make our lives easier, richer, and more creative without sacrificing choice or dignity.This is already happening. As we experiment with privacy-protecting, open-source models for things like browser and email assistants, we see them getting better and better.Imagine a future in which individuals and communities can host small, local AI models – energy-efficient, privacy-preserving and tailored to their needs. Where developers build tools collaboratively, not competitively. Where innovation is measured not by market share, but by public good.That’s not a utopian fantasy. If we start now – building AI that’s open, transparent and rooted in shared values – we can ensure that the next era of technology expands human freedom instead of constraining it. The dot-com crash gave us the modern web. The next correction could give us a better one – if we have the courage to rethink the economics of innovation.In the end, the choice is ours. We can let a handful of companies own the future. Or we can own what we build – together.Mark Surman is the president of MozillaExplore more on these topicsAI (artificial intelligence)OpinionOpen sourcePrivacyInternetMozillacommentShareReuse this content"

You select vodka or gin. But really, you’re an adult, you select gin. A whisper of vermouth, then it’s chilled. A twist of lemon is added or an olive and her brine, then it’s served. And it’s served – we pray – with a sidecar.All martinis should have sidecars. You know when you get a martini and there’s only a sip in the glass and the rest is in a little baby carafe sitting on ice? That’s a sidecar and it should be the law.I love a martini. It’s simple. It’s strong. It’sverystrong. To order a sweet cocktail is to infantalise yourself. Act your age. Put the simple syrup down and have something stiff and drink it slow. The martini has been around for 150 years, after all, so who am I to deny her? You become unstuck in time drinking a martini. You are honouring the great drinkers that came before you. You’re an intellect with a martini. You’re chic. You’re posh.The truth of it is, the martini is actually such a degenerate drink. It’s straight up alcohol; the only thing that makes it feel classy is the glassware and the temperature. It’s boozehound behaviour dressed up in formal wear. If you were drinking lukewarm vodka out of a leftover soda bottle, we would say you had a drinking problem. But drink it ice-cold in a coupe glass and now you’re at Soho House. Now you’re patrician. Now you’re God.So why allow the full martini to idly sit in your glass, tending towards room temperature as time slips away? With each moment, she loses self-respect. With each sip, you inch towards debasement. The sidecar keeps indignity at bay. The bartender made it so: ice. Cold. And we must honour their artistry. A warm sip of gin and you start to lose the context of it all. What am I doing? Do I have a problem? Am I real? Is it all … worth it? The sidecar protects you. Fear not! You aren’t some pervert! You are an aristocrat. You’re the Eternal One.So to all fine drinking establishments, I plead: give my martini a cold little friend. Sidecars for all. And please,please.

In truth, we’re all online now. The number of global social media userssurpassed 5 billionin 2024. To put that into perspective there are 8 billion people on the planet.The internet has totally transformed the ways in which we communicate and share information. First the internet came for print. As free online content began outcompeting subscription newspapers, publishers briefly found new audiences on Facebook, only to seereferral traffic plummetafter the platform begansuppressing postswith external links.Now digital platforms are ending the broadcast era. Just over 15 million people watched England lose to Spainin the final of Euro 2024; the podcaster Joe Rogan has more than 14 million followers on Spotify alone, and another 20 million subscribers on YouTube. Rogan’s reach is global, but there are scores of minor influencers producing weekly or daily YouTube shows that attract audiencesthat rivalandeven surpassthenightly viewershipfor BBC News at Six. This is the era of posting.The shift is not just a matter of where people get their information (or disinformation): the online world is where we build communities, debate and shape ideologies and policy. Digital platforms alter the form and style of these discussions. Online, whether to drinktap watercan be as political as whether to reduce net migration; posting edgy content can shape policy faster than joining a protest; and the appeal of politics is less about meeting material interests than finding what feels authentic amid the fakes, filters and AI slop.The churn of social media acts as a kind of undertow, pulling political conversations toward ideas and tropes that attract enough engagement to rise to the surface of the attention economy. Traditional political communications, with its emphasis on focus group-vetted messaging, either gets washed away or it becomes fodder for mockery, trolling and conspiracy theorising. The institutional gatekeepers have fallen, replaced by influencers who succeed by navigating the fickle currents of audience attention.On X, Elon Musk has re-platformed figures such asNick Fuentes– white supremacist and antisemitic livestreamer – who now has half as many X followers as Keir Starmer. The recently reinstated Andrew Tate’s follower count exceeds the prime minister’s by 9 million. Labour would probably highlight its focus on delivering sensible policies instead of posting online, but as a result it has stumbled into aconspiratorial rat’s nestwith its digital ID policy.In contrast, Reform UK is riding the wave, posting content attuned to ever-changing trends on platforms such as TikTok, where its leader, Nigel Farage, hasmore followers than all other MPscombined. Like all good influencers, heflogs merchand posts videos of himself eithervibing outor“owning” journalists. His audience turns these intosupercuts set to “phonk”music, a subgenre of Memphis hip-hop co-opted byonline reactionaries.Russia has been rightly criticised for spreading disinformation, but pro-Kremlin propaganda has begun to evolve from posting ‘“fake news’” toward seeding platforms with shareable TikTok stickers and reusable audio templates, includingtechno remixes of Soviet folk songsthat have become the soundtrack of pro-Russian war posting on TikTok.The overwhelming liberal focus on disinformation misreads how digital platforms work: misleading content is everywhere, but the real battleground is over emotion and attention, which is what determines whether information – good or bad – finds an audience. This is why cutting-edge propagandists now focus less on policy messaging and more on massaging vibes.As traditional centrist politicians desperately try to appear sensible, their opposition – occasionally on the left, but mostly on the reactionary right – run rampant, riding an ideological wave directed only by the febrile attention of an increasingly desperate and extremely online electorate.The way we do politics has changed and politicians need to wake up to this.Robert Topinka is a reader in digital media and rhetoric at Birkbeck, University of London"

Those days are overFri 30 Jan 2026 01.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 30 Jan 2026 09.42 ESTShareWho was the last politician you listened to for any length of time? Perhaps it was Andy Burnham or Zack Polanski. Or maybe it was Wes Streeting, Nigel Farage orZarah Sultana. Perhaps your dark secret is that it was Donald Trump.One thing these politicians have in common is that they are all unusually good communicators. From Farage’s drawling provocations to Polanski’s pithy directness, Sultana’s concentrated blasts of outrage to Trump’s mesmerising ramblings, they compel you to listen. The completely forgettable passages that voters across western democracies have associated with political speech for decades are largely absent.In some ways, the return of rhetoric as a hugely advantageous political skill feels like a liberation. Nowadays, it’s true, this skill is often deployed in simpler, cruder ways than in the past: in quick, conversational interventions or digressive public statements and question-and-answer sessions, rather than expertly structured formal speeches. Even if Farage becomes the most iconoclastic prime minister since Margaret Thatcher, it is doubtful that his key utterances will be as anthologised and remembered as hers.Yet for anybody who believes that much of politics is unavoidably about conflict, clashing interests and worldviews, and the arousing and articulation of public emotions, the rise of the compelling communicators is hard to resist. Their often dramatic and populist messages are replacing a worn-out discourse.In Britain and other rich democracies for much of the 1990s, 2000s and 2010s, mainstream political speech became ever more inward-looking and impenetrable: stiff with jargon such as “stakeholders”, “social cohesion” and “the third way”. This language essentially said to voters that politics and government were about complex technical questions that could and should be left to insiders. Politicians still regularly addressed the public, but rarely in an accessible enough way to suggest that they wanted voters to truly understand what they had to say.As long as western economies provided the majority with relatively prosperous and improving lives, many voters were not that bothered about being excluded from the political conversation. But the 2008 financial crisis and subsequent wage stagnation and the cost of living crisis ended that semi-contented apathy. The public appetite for frank politicians, which had never completely gone away – as was shown in Britain by the enduring popularity of vivid communicators such as Tony Benn – started to grow again, until it became a hunger so powerful that politics changed to sate it.Wider social, cultural and technological shifts have added to the value of clear political communication. The decline of deference and formal manners, and the creation of uninhibited digital spaces and networks, have given us a world of outrageous YouTubers and indiscreet voice notes, unbuttoned podcasts and confessional pop songs with the vocals mixed so high that you can hear the singer breathing. Against the backdrop of all this intimate – or intimate-seeming – public communication, a typically formalKeir Starmerspeech or statement, while appropriate for delicate foreign policy work such as his trip to China, in a domestic context sounds almost as out of date and incomprehensible to many voters as a politician from the 1950s.Many of his problems as party leader and prime minister are really about communication, and the belief that Burnham or Streeting orAngela Raynerwould do it much better. As well as being more natural-sounding public speakers – more colloquial and at ease with cultural references – all three sometimes make being a politician actually look enjoyable: Rayner smiling as she bashes the Tories, Streeting plotting with relish, or Burnham enthusing about the transformation of Greater Manchester’s public transport. By contrast, Starmer’s talk of doing his “duty” in a “government of service” weighs voters down, sounding too much like the grind of their own lives. Political communication is often about personifying the right mood.View image in fullscreenFormer prime minister Boris Johnson at the launch of the Indomitable Ukraine exhibition in London, 23 September 2025.Photograph: James Manning/PAAnd yet, appearing to embody some form of welcome change and presenting ideas and policies in appealing ways are hardly the whole of politics. There are also tasks that need to be carried out less publicly: drawing up policies and strategies, undermining rivals and other parties, and making sure that your government’s plans are actually carried out. One danger of the sometimes exhilarating overthrow of technocratic politics is that democracies end up with a politics that is mostly just talk, while less performative but vital aspects of government and opposition are neglected.Boris Johnson’s terrible premiership has already given Britain a taste of government by little but rhetoric. But the speed with which voters have tired of Starmer’s more conscientious administration suggests that many would prefer not to think about how much repair work Britain actually needs. Technocrats such as Starmer wrongly assume that governments don’t need to explain and justify themselves in direct, resonant ways. Yet they are right that not everything a government does can be articulated in colourful, straightforward terms, as populists often claim.From the Burnham row to the China visit, avoiding hard choices is the Starmer doctrine | Rafael BehrRead moreCould our more conventional, cautious politicians adapt to the new communications age? Some are trying. This week, Starmer announced the government’s new policy capping ground rents for leaseholders – a typically worthwhile but hard to dramatise reform – on TikTok. Walking stiffly towards the camera, making too many clenched- rather than open-hand gestures, he concluded with a repetitive sentence that suggested he didn’t quite trust himself to be clear, or clearly understood: “This is a promise that we said we’d deliver, and I’m really pleased that we’re delivering on that promise.” After years of self-control and careful language, it’s probably too late for him and his most guarded ministers to loosen up in public now.As with generations of western centrists, Starmer’s communications style has been shaped by the assumption that powerful conservative interests – big business, financial markets, rightwing journalists and voters – must be offended as little as possible. That approach served leaders such as Tony Blair well, at least in electoral terms. But that was a long time ago. Nowadays, however much Starmer plays down his more leftwing policies and emphasises his patriotic, pro-business or authoritarian credentials, conservatives hate him anyway. Such is our more polarised world. Meanwhile, populists of both left and right say supposedly taboo things to voters – and soar in the polls.It’s time for the government to speak differently. That won’t necessarily save it, so numerous are its enemies and problems. But at leastLabourwill be back in the conversation.Andy Beckett is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsPoliticsOpinionKeir StarmerNigel FarageAndy BurnhamZack PolanskiAngela RaynerWes StreetingcommentShareReuse this content"

But politicians of all stripes have prioritised opening new lines over maintaining existing onesFri 30 Jan 2026 00.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 30 Jan 2026 11.44 ESTShareSpain has the most extensive high-speed rail network in Europe and the second-largest in the world after China. A source of immense national pride, the train system has grown and become more affordable thanks to a boom in rail passengers and competition among train companies. Every few minutes, a train departs from Madrid for Barcelona and vice versa, linking the country’s two most populous cities. This 600km journey takes less than three hours foran average fare of €65.Thirty-four years after the first high-speed train between Madrid and Seville, the network nowconnects more than 50 cities in Spain. Along with being a badge of pride for the country, it even commands a rare political consensus. At least that was the case until this month’s calamities. In the first accident,one train derailed and collidedwith another near the town of Adamuz in Andalucía, killing 45 people and leaving dozens more injured. A second accident in Catalonia, caused by the collapse of a wall in bad weather,killed the driverof a commuter train in Barcelona. The local network, which has suffered delays and malfunctions for years, was completely halted for days as a result.The network’s safety record remains strong, but these shocks have sparked debate on underinvestment in infrastructure maintenance and become yet another issue for angry, partisan conflict.Spaniards love trains. Travel by train now accounts formore than 56% of all transport, surpassing road and air transport combined. In 2024, long-distance trains carried85 million passengersa 15% increase on the previous year. The shock of what happened hits closer to home since trains are such an integral part of daily life and continue to provide a reliable service for many across the country (even if local networks remain a source of frustration and the most depopulated areas have gradually lost their services over the years).The investigation into the Andalucía derailment is ongoing but the focus of inquiries is on the point where the accident happened, specifically on abroken weldconnecting tworails, one from 1989 and one from 2023. There is now political disagreement over the extent to which the infrastructure on the Madrid-Seville line, among the oldest in the high-speed network, had been overhauled.The minister for transport, Óscar Puente, a divisive figure who often takes to social media to criticise journalists and political rivals, acknowledged thathe was mistakenon some of the details in his first statements on the crash.The centre-right People’s party (PP) is using the dispute to mount a broader attack on the government. Party leader Alberto Núñez Feijóo evenmade a puncomparing the state of the railway with the state of the nation.The PP-led regional government in Valencia was widely criticised for mismanaging the floods in the area in 2024, and its president was forced to resign a year later. Now many in the PP are pushing to blame the Socialist-led national government for the train disaster. Only a few conservative officials, such as the president of Andalucía, have refrained from exploiting the tragedy for political point scoring.Despite the blame game, the truth is that the high-speed network has been the result of a long-term commitment by politicians across the political spectrum. But prioritising investment in new lines over the maintenance of existing infrastructure has been a persistent pattern too. Regardless of party affiliation, politicians tend to like inaugurating a new line or a renovated train station. There are few photo opportunities to be had and little kudos attached to the boring but vital task of upgrading tracks in the middle of the countryside.The centre-left governmenthas invested morein rails and maintenance than the previous conservative administration, which ran the country in the aftermath of the financial crisis. Still, with growing traffic, new lines and more passengers, Spain spends less on maintenance per kilometrethan Germany or Switzerland, even if such comparisons are imperfect given differences in network age and the cost of public works and materials.Moving forward requires a serious, careful approach for both the government and the opposition, not another partisan, unscrupulous race to the bottom for political gain.And yes, there is still a lot to love about trains in Spain. They are cheaper, faster and more comfortable than most inEurope.María Ramírez is a journalist and deputy managing editor of elDiario.es, a news outlet in SpainExplore more on these topicsSpainOpinionRail transportTrain crashesEuropecommentShareReuse this content"

When Brett Ratner’s contentious, Amazon-backed documentary previewed at the White House last weekend, the guestlist included Mike Tyson, Queen Rania of Jordan and the president himself. Today it’s just me in the room and Melania on the screen. It makes for a more intimate and exclusive affair.One adult for the 9.40am in Sittingbourne: a front row seat for Melania’s ominous UK openingRead moreThis mood of cosy conviviality extends all the way through the opening credits; at which point the chill descends and the novocaine kicks in, as the film’s star and executive producer proceeds to guide us – with agonising glacial slowness – through the preparations for her husband’s second presidential inauguration. She glides from the fashion fitting to the table setting, and from the “candlelit dinner” to the “starlight ball”, with a face like a fist and a voice of sheet metal. “Candlelight and black tie and my creative vision,” she says, as though listing the ingredients in a cauldron. “As first lady, children will always remain my priority,” she coos, and you can almost picture her coaxing them into her little gingerbread house.No doubt there is a great documentary to be made about Melania Knauss, the ambitious model from out of Slovenia who married a New York real-estate mogul and then found herself cast in the role of a latter-day Eva Braun, but the horrific Melania emphatically isn’t it. It’s one of those rare, unicorn films that doesn’t have a single redeeming quality. I’m not even sure it qualifies as a documentary, exactly, so much as an elaborate piece of designer taxidermy, horribly overpriced and ice-cold to the touch and proffered like a medieval tribute to placate the greedy king on his throne.And so it goes on. Melania moves through the action like a listless automaton, talking constantly but saying nothing, squired from Mar-a-Lago to Trump Tower to her final destination, the White House. What drama there is chiefly hinges on her concern that her white blouse is too loose at the neck and needs to be cut and then tightened, much to the consternation of the fitters. Melania misses her mother, she says, but she loves Michael Jackson and Barron and possibly her husband as well, although Trump himself is mostly a background presence here, shuffling in at intervals to brag about his election win and complain that his inauguration clashes with the televised college football playoffs. “They probably did it on purpose,” he says.Eggs, hats and unfettered ambition: what we learned about Melania Trump from her documentaryRead moreIt’s dispiriting, it’s deadly and it’s spectacularly unrevealing. Ratner’s film plays like a gilded trash remake of Jonathan Glazer’s The Zone of Interest in which a button-eyed Cinderella points at gold baubles and designer dresses, cunningly distracting us while her husband and his cronies prepare to dismantle the Constitution and asset-strip the federal government. “White and gold – that’s so you,” purrs one of her lickspittles as she busies herself with the colour-scheme for the ball and the incoming first lady allows that yes indeed, this is true.It’s no spoiler to reveal that phew, thank heavens, Trump’s second inauguration goes swimmingly well in the end. This despite the unfortunate clash with the college football game. This despite the infuriating looseness of the first lady’s white blouse. The preparations are exhausting but the euphoria of the moment sees her through, all the way to the starlight ball where she briefly boogies along to the Village People’s YMCA. “Being awake for 22-hours felt like nothing,” she gushes, which is nice to hear and good for her. But the fun’s not infectious and the guests are a nightmare, and two hours of Melania feels like pure, endless hell.Melania is out nowExplore more on these topicsMelaniaMelania TrumpreviewsShareReuse this content"

She died after a brief illness.O’Hara started her comedy career in the 1970s and helped to create the Canadian sketch show SCTV. She broke into film in the 1980s with her first big-screen credit in the romantic comedy Nothing Personal with Donald Sutherland, and in 1985 she had a role in Martin Scorsese’s black comedy After Hours.Catherine O’Hara managed to make difficult characters utterly delightulRead moreIn 1988, O’Hara starred in Tim Burton’s comedy horror Beetlejuice and later reprised the role in the2024 sequel. On the set of the original, she met her husband, production designer Bo Welch, and they married in 1992.O’Hara played Macaulay Culkin’s careless mother in the smash hit 1990 comedy Home Alone, a role she also reprised for the 1992 sequel.“It’s a perfect movie, isn’t it?” she said of Home Alone toPeoplein 2024. She added, of the experience: “It was lovely. All those kids that played our children were just lovely.”O’Hara recentlyappearedat Culkin’s Hollywood Walk of Fame ceremony, wiping away tears as she praised him.Culkin paid tribute to O’Hara onInstagram, writing: “Mama. I thought we had time. I wanted more. I wanted to sit in a chair next to you. I heard you but I had so much more to say. I love you. I’ll see you later.”She began working with Christopher Guest in 1996, starring in the mockumentary Waiting for Guffman, and starred in three more of his films: Best in Show, A Mighty Wind and For Your Consideration in 2006.Guest praised O’Hara for her ability to master comedy and drama in their last collaboration together. “Catherine is one of not many actresses that can pull off both sides of this, where she’s incredibly funny but can also shift into an emotional area that surprises people and it’s just amazing, that transition,”he said.Catherine O’Hara: a life in picturesRead moreO’Hara also provided her voice for many animated films including Chicken Little, Over the Hedge, Monster House, Frankenweenie and, most recently, The Wild Robot.View image in fullscreenCatherine O’Hara in Schitt’s Creek.Photograph: APOn the small screen, she had roles in The Larry Sanders Show, Six Feet Under, Curb Your Enthusiasm and 30 Rock before she reunited with another Guest actor, Eugene Levy, for the hit sitcom Schitt’s Creek.“It’s always more fun working with someone you know,” she said to theGuardianin 2021. “I get too nervous doing solo bits – it’s too much pressure and it feels like showing off. With someone else, you can share the showing off.”The show, about a wealthy family who are forced to downsize, ran for six seasons and won O’Hara an Emmy award.Her recent television roles also included A Series of Unfortunate Events and The Last of Us, which scored her an Emmy nomination.Her Last of Us co-star Pedro Pascal paid tribute on Instagram. “Oh, genius to be near you,” hewrote. “Eternally grateful. There is less light in my world, this lucky world that had you, will keep you, always.”O’Hara had recently been seen in the award-winning comedy series The Studio with Seth Rogen. The role had garnered her Emmy and Golden Globe nominations.Catherine O’Hara on the joy of Schitt’s Creek: ‘Eugene Levy is the sweetest man!’Read moreRon Howard, who directed O’Hara in the 1992 comedy drama The Paper, paid his respects on social media.“This is shattering news,” hewrote. “What a wonderful person, artist and collaborator. I was lucky enough to direct, produce and act in projects with her and she was simply growing more brilliant with each year.”Meryl Streep, who starred in Heartburn with O’Hara, also shared a statement: “Catherine O’Hara brought love and light to our world, through whipsmart compassion for the collection of eccentrics she portrayed ... such a loss for her family and friends, and the audience she graced as friends.”Rita Wilson alsocalledher “authentic and truthful in all she did” on Instagram while Lily Tomlinwrote“bright, beautiful, and full of joy that touched so many” next to a picture of O’Hara.Mike Myerssharedwith the Hollywood Reporter: “It is a very sad day for comedy and for Canada. She was one of the greatest comedy artists in history, an inspiration for millions and above all a very elegant lady. Sending much love and condolences to her family.”“I’m always drawn to characters who have no idea of the impression they’re making on other people,” O’Hara said in 2021. “We’re all delusional, really, and I love that about us humans and I love playing it.”Explore more on these topicsCatherine O'HaraSchitt's CreekUS televisionTelevisionnewsShareReuse this content"

Stewart and her star, Imogen Poots, talk about the passion and pain that fuelled itFri 30 Jan 2026 00.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 30 Jan 2026 08.22 ESTShare‘The movie is to be eaten alive and re-metabolised and shat out differently, from everyone’s perspective,” saysKristen Stewart, bracingly. The actor’s directorial debut, The Chronology of Water, has been doing the rounds at film festivals, and when we meet in London the reviews are coming in. Stewart knows that this impressionistic, arthouse collage of a film – adapted from an experimental memoir about a woman’s pain and loss, the elusive nature of memory and the reclamation of desire – is not going to be for everyone. “My favourite Letterboxd review is: ‘The Chronology of what the fuck did I just watch?’” But it matters to her that people respond to it. “Whether it’s your least favourite movie or your most favourite, it’s not lying, it’s genuine. And I’m so fucking proud of that.”Stewart is sitting next to the film’s star, a slightly more sanguine Imogen Poots. Watching Stewart talk, her leg bouncing, her vocabulary ferocious, feels a bit like being sandblasted. It is invigorating and strangely galvanising, but you don’t go into a conversation with her half asleep. The same can be said for the film itself. “Language is a metaphor for experience,” writes the author Lidia Yuknavitch, at the beginning of the book on which it is based. “It’s as arbitrary as this mass of chaotic images we call memory.”View image in fullscreenStewart directing Poots on set.Photograph: Andrejs StrokinsStewart first read the book in 2018, while on the set of the movieJT LeRoy. She saw the visual potential in this mass of chaotic images and quickly decided it would be her first feature-length film as director. “Forty pages in, I was so rallied and so viciously adamant that nobody else could make the movie but me,” she says. “It was so physical. So vital. Such a permeating secret. There’s an unearthing quality to the way that [Yuknavitch] talked about trespass, and how your desires are carved into your body. As a woman, we have these seeping birthplaces that are our orifices, and it’s where we hold our power, but it’s also where we’re taken advantage of.” At this point, less than two minutes in, it’s fair to say that it isn’t quite turning out to be your run-of-the-mill movie-star promotional chat. “We’re all so muzzled,” Stewart says. “And it just felt like the muzzle was off. That’s the fun part. It’s got a loud mouth. A big, wide-open mouth.” So she sent Yuknavitch an email.The Chronology of Water review – Kristen Stewart makes a traumatic splash with directorial debutRead more“A wildly exciting email,” the author says, from her home in Portland, Oregon. “She was explaining to me why I could never let this book be a regular biopic movie, and how I had to let her make a piece of art out of it. The language she used went under my skin immediately, because it wasn’t regular-person language.” Yuknavitch, obsessed with films since she was five, was, of course, familiar with Stewart’s work. “I even wrote a novel with her in mind, a while ago. She was younger. She had just punched through the Twilight experiences, and she was moving toward independent art films, and I pictured her in my brain when I wrote this novel.” It is called Dora: A Headcase. It sounds like a spooky connection, if she believes in that kind of thing? Artists, Yuknavitch replies, have a tendency to find each other. “They run across each other’s work, and these threads or streams we don’t entirely understand touch each other. And I think that’s what happened.”It’s about the gouging out of desire, and how empowered that is. In a slug line, it’s a really tough sellIt was not an easy film to finance. Poots and Stewart, both big readers, get into a meaty discussion about how confessional literature is taken seriously when men write it, and “belittled, constantly”, Stewart says, when it comes from women. “There are so many examples within modern literature of men laying it all bare, but as soon as you do something overtly personal as a woman, it’s less serious,” Stewart continues. “We’ve just been fully X-ed out of modernism in the canon. It’s like we don’t exist in it whatsoever. And it’s such a fucking crock of shit. You have to be Virginia Woolf to be considered a good writer.”Reese’s Book Club, this is not.View image in fullscreen‘The film is a collection of fluids and fragments’ … Lidia (Poots, on right) with her sister Claudia (Thora Birch).Photograph: BFI DistributionDid they come up against those attitudes when making the film? “Yes, because I think when people read it, it was reduced to how to sell it,” says Stewart. “OK, well, what’s it about, incest and rape? Fun!” It was not an easy pitch, she admits. “It’s about the gouging out of desire, and the reframing of that, and how empowered that is. In a slug line, it’s a really tough sell.” It took eight years of development before they finally got to work, mostly on location in Latvia. In the meantime, Stewart continued to act, and directed smaller projects: a couple of short films and a music video, for the bandBoygenius. Chronology ticked away in the background, sometimes unpromisingly, until eventually it somehow came together. Even Stewart’s longtime producer, Charles Gillibert (On the Road, Personal Shopper), had told her that he couldn’t finish the script. “And he’s not the only one. He really encouraged me not to make this movie,” she smiles. “I was like: we’re gonna cease being friends if you keep saying this to me.”Poots plays the adult Lidia with bodily gusto. The film is a collection of fluids and fragments. Poots read Stewart’s screenplay, and then the book, and then sent Stewart “a really pretentious email, which shelappedup”, she teases. Was she nervous about taking on a role that is so stark and exposing? It pulses with sex and drugs and violence. Bleeding and sobbing and grief wash over it. “Any actress I know would have wanted to play this part,” says Poots. In fact, she explains, casting her as the lead meant that the film was harder to make. “If Kristen had hired a massive movie star, then it would have made getting the money a hell of a lot easier,” she says.Poots is a best-kept-secret kind of actor, and her performance here is immense, but I ask Stewart why she felt so loyal to her. “She’s my favourite actor, and everyone else sucked,” she shrugs. “There was literally no one else, and she’s been a fave of mine for ever.”View image in fullscreenStewart on the red carpet at Cannes with (from left) Kim Gordon, Poots and Birch, in May 2025.Photograph: Guillaume Horcajuelo/EPA-EFE/Shutterstock“And we have the same teeth,” says Poots, showing them off.Stewart flashes hers in unison. “Because we have the same teeth, I thought: this is my girl. Bucktooth!”The film also stars Kim Gordon, Thora Birch and Jim Belushi, who plays the late One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest author Ken Kesey. It is a merry band of misfits. “What’s really cool, and you wouldn’t have been aware of it, is that these people, who have all been at the centre of these incredibly creative community movements, wanted in on what you were doing,” says Poots to Stewart.Did she pull in any favours to get them involved? “Nobody did meanyfavours, trust me,” Stewart says, gravely. “In fact, we got fucked. In the face. Over and over.” She pauses. “Like a real woman!” she jokes. To be honest, she says, Belushi came on board after a couple of other actors dropped out. “I don’t think it was an easy yes. But the feeling of him supporting you, a nice pat on the back from Jim Belushi, could make you cry. He’s kind of a radical, and he’s a hippy, and he was perfect to play this part.”Imogen is just a knock-down, one-two-punch, hazelnut-popping actress out of the Brit academy if I ever saw itAs the film deals in memories, it rejects any sort of conventional narrative structure. Men come in and out of Lidia’s life, which meant that actors would come on set briefly and leave again, “sort of like a conveyor belt”, says Poots.“Or chapters,” suggests Stewart.“These insanely brilliant, talented actors,” says Poots.“And theyservicedyou,” grins Stewart. “It was fucking incredible to watch male actors come in and have it not be about them. I would be like: sorry, but we’re actually not gonna shoot you. We’re just gonna shoot her. But talk to her. You’re here, kind of, but this is about her.”Poots cackles. I’m guessing this is not a typical experience? “Mmmm,” says Poots. “For so many reasons.” Both say they plan to make “a lot more movies” together.A few weeks later, Birch video calls from her home in Los Angeles, her dog lounging happily in the background. “You cannot enter a conversation with Kristen Stewart without coming locked, loaded and ready to go,” she laughs. “It’s intimidating!” Birch plays Lidia’s older sister, Claudia, in a brief but mighty role. In one of the film’s earliest scenes, she holds a sobbing, grief-racked Poots in the bath, following the death of Lidia’s stillborn baby girl. “Imogen is just a knock-down, one-two-punch, hazelnut-popping actress out of the Brit academy if I ever saw it,” Birch says, brilliantly.Thora Birch: how Hollywood’s darling disappearedRead moreBirch and Stewart had met at an event where they did some “mutual fangirling”. A few months later, Stewart called and said she was making a movie. Birch signed on straight away, and then she read the script. “I’m not going to lie, it was a little bit of a daunting process,” she says. “But I just trusted her already.” Partly, she thinks, that’s because they have some shared experiences. Both became famous as children. Stewart was 12 when she starred in Panic Room, while Birch’s run of 1990s and early 2000s films – from Hocus Pocus to Now and Then to Ghost World – defined adolescence for a whole generation of girls.“Maybe I related to her because we’re both performers who started out very, very young, and so we had a common language. I say she’s my spirit animal. She does a lot of things that I do, but just way better,” Birch says. She had followed Stewart’s career from afar. “Different times, different generations, but the way she handled [getting famous young], I was just like: dude, that’s with aplomb. You knocked it out of the park, because you held on to your individuality and your point of view, which can really be difficult to hold on to.” She waves a hand. “But let’s not get too far into that.”In its boldness and experimental form, The Chronology of Water may well be a surprise to those more familiar with Stewart, the movie star, who might not expect a film like this from her. “I sort of did,” counters Birch. “This is a very Kristen Stewart movie.”‘I could eat this podium with a fork and knife I’m so angry’: Kristen Stewart blasts neglect of female film-makersRead moreShe is glad, she says, that this is the story Stewart chose to tell. “She will hate me for saying it, but I’m sorry, this is emblematic of a female experience that not a lot of people are ready, willing or even able to dissect and talk about.” The movie covers some “heavy shit”, Birch says. “We’re talking about period blood and stillborns and familial sexual abuse. Nobody wants to talk about this stuff, and yet she presents it in such a way that it marries fantasy and poeticism, and but also the human experience. It’s a punk rock arthouse movie that is like a non-psychedelic ayahuasca trip.”It makes sense, then, that Birch had no idea how it would turn out. She just had to have faith in what they were doing. “And then when I saw it, I was like: oh,that’swhat she’s doing. One reviewer said: homegirl can direct. And coming from LA, I was like: yeah, that’s it. Homegirl can direct. She knows what’s up.”The Chronology of Water is released in UK cinemas on 6 FebruaryExplore more on these topicsKristen StewartinterviewsShareReuse this content"

The star talks about his fantastical new show Small Prophets, his obsession with middle-age and being ‘weird-looking’Fri 30 Jan 2026 04.16 ESTLast modified on Fri 30 Jan 2026 04.41 ESTSharePrefer the Guardian on GoogleIn Small Prophets, BBC Two’s new six-parter, Mackenzie Crook plays Gordon, the manager of a massive DIY store. Sometimes it feels as if we’re falling through time, because it’s like watching Gareth, Crook’s breakthrough part inThe Office, a quarter of a century on. “Pedantic and jobsworthy, he could be Gareth grown up, just with more disappointment, without the West Country accent,” says Crook. “I wrote Gordon as a monster, but by the end, I was actually quite fond of him.”In person, Crook has a jumpy, modest energy. When he was young, on screen it used to look like nerves, but now looks more like curiosity. He has a surprising number of tattoos, but maybe I should stop being surprised when people have those.View image in fullscreen‘I wrote him as a monster’ … Crook as Gordon in Small Prophets.Photograph: BBCGordon isn’t the hero of Small Prophets; he’s not even the antihero. This is the story of Michael, played by Pearce Quigley, in a performance so comically, subtly heartbreaking you can rarely figure out what you’re melancholy about. Fiftyish, bearded, a twitcher and a hoarder, he works in the DIY store and visits his dad, Brian (a lovely performance fromMichael Palin), every afternoon. Michael has a huge tragedy in the recent past – his girlfriend Clea disappeared without trace seven years before – but he would never make a song and dance about it.At first sight, it could be a delicate and truthful rumination on middle age. “Of course it is,” says Crook. “I’m a little bit obsessed by being middle-aged. It crept up on me. Everything seems to have been 20 years ago. It’s a surprise to find myself with grownup children.” He pauses, then says gravely: “‘Grownup children’ is a horrible expression. ‘Have you got children?’ ‘Oh yes, they’re grownup now.’” This is a classic Crook tangent – you’ll know it if you lovedDetectorists– a thought delivered with bottomless sorrow, which is true but so amped up and exaggerated that it becomes funny. Honestly, having grownup children (Crook has two: Scout, 19, and Jude, 22 – a standup comedian) isn’tthatsad. Time passing isn’tthatbad. It’s better than if it didn’t pass. The butt of the joke is melancholy itself, but the melancholy is also real.View image in fullscreen‘I’m a little bit obsessed by being middle-aged’ … Mackenzie Crook.Photograph: Matt CrockettAnyway, in a midlife rut is where Michael starts. Then his dad throws in the spanner that he knows how to grow homunculi – miniature, fully (if weirdly) formed humans of whom you can ask any question and they have to tell you the truth. Brian beseeches his son to follow the recipe; maybe the creatures can tell him what happened to Clea. Michael does as his dad asks, trying to be kind, thinking he’s losing his marbles. He follows the instructions, and when he taps each of the clouded bell jars to reveal the homunculi, the effect – maybe because it’s so unexpected, maybe because of the low-key ordinariness of the suburban street, the hero, the neighbours, maybe because magic realism is a thing only a few people can pull off – is fabulous, in every sense. “I’ve always been fascinated by stories of lonely people. And I’ve also been fascinated by stories of ordinary people that something extraordinary happens to, and turns their life upside down.”Life carries on as if the supernatural hasn’t happened. Work is still mundane and the neighbour still moans constantly about the state of Michael’s front garden. He was written as a villain, too, “but [actor] Jon Pointing brought something to him that made me feel sorry for him. He just wants some peace and quiet, some order, and he’s living next to this chaotic rogue who seems to have an inner peace. How can this bearded guy, this hoarder, be more content than I am? I wrote these quite two-dimensional, old-school sitcom characters – the boss, the next-door neighbour – and they didn’t come out that way.”View image in fullscreen‘The BBC just let me go away and do whatever’ … Crook with Toby Jones in The Detectorists.Photograph: Jack Barnes/BBC/Channel XThis is a project drawn from a life of influences; giants of experiment and surrealism – David Lynch andMichel Gondry,Charlie Kaufmanand Spike Jonze – but also 70s and 80s shows,The Good Life, Ever Decreasing Circles, “their lack of cynicism, their lack of cruelty”. It’s landed somewhere unique, though it couldn’t not remind you of Detectorists in its core sensibility. “After The Office, I wanted to write something that wasn’t cruel humour, that didn’t have a cringe factor. And in doing so, I stumbled upon my genre – gentle comedy.” I’m not wild about the term; it sounds both unfunny and as if you’re trying not to offend anyone. “OK, it’s probably more complicated than I know. I don’t want to flag up anything. I don’t want to tell people when to laugh, when to cry, what to feel. I like downplaying stuff.”The Office played down nothing, and no awkward situation would end before it had got a thousand times more awkward. Crook – who was born Paul Crook, but changed his name when registering with Equity, the actors’ union – rewatched it for the first time recently and got what sounds like a PTSD flashback. “In series two, a fire alarm goes off and everyone’s evacuated. Watching it, I had this real Pavlovian reaction where my heart just sank, because I knew something awful was coming up. I’d forgotten all about it.” (David and Gareth start trying to get a disabled employee down the stairs, then give up halfway through, saying if it was a real fire they’d definitely come back for her. It’s excruciating.) The show famously popularised the spoof TV documentary, but it also put the pain into “painfully funny”.View image in fullscreenDon’t look back in anger … Crook as Gareth Keenan with Ricky Gervais as David Brent in The Office.Photograph: Jack Barnes/BBCIt was a hard landing into fame for Crook in the 00s. “It became this thing in the press, I was the weird-looking bloke. And I thought: ‘You’ve put that on me; I don’t think I do look weird. You’re thinking of Gareth, and now you can’t see past Gareth, so I will for ever be weird-looking. Or maybe I am weird-looking? But surely if I was weird-looking, that would have been what kids at school said?’” What did the people at school say? “Well, I was small. And my name was Paul. So I was Small Paul.”He’s also much happier writing, editing and directing. “Acting I’m not that fussed about. It’s fun. But I’m not that into it any more. And I’ve never been convinced by my acting. I can always see myself acting my socks off, honestly. When I look at The Office, in my eyes, I seem to be in a different show to everyone else. Martin Freeman is so natural, so believable, and then my Gareth comes in, and it’s like: ‘What are you doing, mate? Tone it down a bit.’ But people like the character so it might be just me thinking that.”When he had the idea for Detectorists, which first aired in 2014, it was quite different to what landed on the screen. “It was bleaker. The whole thing with metal detecting is that it happens in the winter months when there are no crops, so I envisaged two men in parkas standing in the crosswinds in a ploughed field. But we shot the pilot on the hottest day of the summer, and it just looks so beautiful, I realised we would be missing a trick to set it in greyness. The weather and the countryside became a big part of the show.” Andy (Crook) and Lance (Toby Jones) have this symbiotic, very quiet heroism – every day a miniature triumph over the disappointment that seems to hover on every horizon. It’s written into their hobby! Metal detectorists rarely find any Saxon coins.View image in fullscreenOdd squad … Pearce Quigley and Lauren Patel in Small Prophets.Photograph: BBCDetectorists has the kind of superfans that only really idiosyncratic dramas have, which Crook says is because the BBC let him do what he wanted. “It was so low stakes that they didn’t have to meddle with it, they just let me go away and do whatever. And it turned out to be this thing that people love and hold dear. On Small Prophets, the stakes are a little higher, because it’s got these surreal, magic realism elements in it, so it’s more expensive.” When he pitched it to the BBC, it was a show in which things happened that might never get resolved – maybe you’d never find out what happened to Clea; maybe the kids who steal a security van would just get away with it. “And that’s how it’s worked. It’s fantastical and strange, but hopefully not forced, although the way I just described it, it does sound forced.”The homunculi are stop-motion animation, not CGI, because he wanted the nostalgia – “it was a deliberate attempt to put some magic into it” – and the creatures, rather than the characters, are where the idea started. “You know, I don’t believe in the supernatural at all,” he starts, before allowing, “I remember as a kid getting The Unexplained magazine – pictures of ghosts and spontaneous human combustion – and wanting to believe it, wanting stuff to exist that you can’t explain. I guess those are the elements of the stories I loved as a child, James and the Giant Peach, lonely kids, lonely orphans. I don’t know why, because I came from a happy, loving family with siblings and friends, but there’s something romantic about it. Sad escapism. Maybe that’s my genre.”Small Prophets is onBBC Two and iPlayer from 9 February.Explore more on these topicsMackenzie CrookTelevisionTV comedyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Possessed of a piercing tone, innate melodic sensibility and a singularly uncompromising approach on the bandstand, Davis spent his five-decade career presiding over numerous stylistic shifts: bebop to “cool” jazz, modal jazz, electronic fusion, jazz funk and even hip-hop. Always honing his ear for fresh talent, he turned his bands into incubators for rising artists, providing early starts for the pianists Herbie Hancock, Chick Corea and Keith Jarrett, saxophonistsSonny Rollins, John Coltrane and Wayne Shorter, and drummers Tony Williams and Jack DeJohnette.With 2026 marking the centenary of Davis’s birth, I asked several of his surviving collaborators to select his greatest recordings and discuss his enduring influence, including the 95-year-old Rollins, who played with Davis in the 1950s; the guitarist John Scofield and the saxophonist Bill Evans, who both played with Davis in his 80s fusion groups; and several contemporary jazz stars.Sonny Rollins: ‘‘We know that with Miles you better not make any mistakes!’View image in fullscreenMiles Davis and Sonny Rollins on stage at the New York Jazz Festival, 1957.Photograph: Bob Parent/Getty ImagesI met Miles as a young man and we soon became very good friends. He moved to uptown New York, where I was living, and he’d come by my house to talk about music and the state of jazz. One day, not long after we started hanging out, we were in a cab and he turned to me and said I looked like the great baseball player Don Newcombe. From then on he would call me “Newk”, and the nickname stuck.He was very sincere and very serious about the music. When we started playing together, we would practise for hours and hours, and even though everyone in his bands liked and admired him, we knew that when you played with Miles you better not make any mistakes! He would hear every note each person played, and we all took something different away from his wisdom. He didn’t want to be like the other guys leading bands and he didn’t want to look backwards. He has a character to his music that is the sound of that constant change.Miles Davis Bluing featuring Sonny Rollins.The composition of his that I love the most is Four. It was recorded early in Miles’s career with a great quartet of Horace Silver on piano, Percy Heath on bass and Art Blakey on drums. It’s a composition that set the pace for jazz to come since it started the trend of tunes with a similar tempo and 32-bar structure. It was one of the first tracks that took on the attitude and swagger that Miles became known for. He truly was one of the best people in jazz and he taught me so much. I still hear him in so many young guys today – they play like Miles if they can.Terence Blanchard: ‘He didn’t bow down to jazz history’View image in fullscreenTerence Blanchard at the La Défense Jazz Festival, June 2025, in Puteaux, France.Photograph: Richard Bord/Getty ImagesMiles didn’t play the trumpet like a trumpet; he produced a personal sound. He was really into melody and phrasing rather than playing licks with lots of notes to show off technique, and he always played the moment, since it’s what was happening at the time in the music that would dictate what he expressed through his horn. That’s ultimately what has kept all of his music fresh.One of the first jazz records I ever got was the liveMiles Davisalbum Four & More when I was 15. From the very first trilling high note that he plays to the ballads he performs with a straight tone and no vibrato, it was different from anything I’d heard. The more I learned about the history of jazz, the more I realised how different this guy was, since he came from a tradition of Dizzy Gillespie and Fats Navarro, guys who were blowing the bell off the horn, and he even played with Bird [bebop pioneer Charlie Parker]. But rather than play fast or loud, he chose to play soft. He came from the history of the music but didn’t bow down to it – he was my first indication that jazz should never stand still, it should always be growing.I got the chance to meet him backstage at a festival in Perugia, Italy, in the 80s, and he called me over to him. I was amazed he knew who I was. He had that signature raspy voice and just said: “Terreeeeence, keep doing what you’re doing, motherfucker.” I’ll be playing some tribute concerts to Miles this year, but I won’t be trying to sound like him. Instead, the best way to honour him is to play like myself, as that’s exactly what he always did. He was so fearless.John Scofield: ‘Sometimes he would call you up the next day to talk about your playing’View image in fullscreenMiles Davis and John Scofield at the Grande Parade du Jazz in Nice, July 1985.Photograph: Patrick Aventurier/Gamma-Rapho/Getty ImagesI joined his band in the early 1980s. It was an honour to learn from him. He loved to discuss all the ways we could play jazz or the mindsets to allow yourself to improvise and create magic by simply letting go. My main takeaway from Miles was noticing how he played with the band and how fierce a bandleader he was. He would record every gig we did and sometimes he would call you up the next day to talk about your playing – he led us all fearlessly.View image in fullscreen‘He led us all fearlessly’ … Davis on stage at the Congress Palace of Paris, October 1983.Photograph: Joel Robine/AFP/Getty ImagesHis groove and rhythm are perfect; he could play rhythmic jazz so well and he was great knowing exactly where to place each note. He always talked to us about leaving space for the music to gel and breathe and move forwards in our soloing. When I listen to him now, his music never feels old.Melissa Aldana: ‘You hear one note and you know it’s him’View image in fullscreenMelissa Aldana at the Philharmonie Essen, 2024.Photograph: Imago / Alamy Stock PhotoI loveSo What: a genius composition because it’s built on only two minor chords. As jazz musicians, we’ve all played So What over the years and it’s one of the hardest tunes to play effectively because there’s so much possibility over those chords and you have to choose in which direction to go. He set the tone for modern jazz by creating such a sense of space and silence in his sound.When you hear his great quartets, especially with Wayne Shorter, you can hear how he allows people to express themselves without fear of the unknown – they all have a certain telepathy and it takes a true leader to bring it out. There’s no ego in the music despite Miles’s strong character. They’re all invested in the bigger picture of how they’re telling the story of the music together.Miles Davis plays So What live.Also, you hear one note and you know it’s Miles. You can’t play like that and not be spiritual; you have to be in touch with something higher to have that sound.Jay Phelps: ‘Being a superstar in that environment meant he wasn’t always the nicest’View image in fullscreenJay Phelps at the London Jazz Festival, 2011.Photograph: Andy Sheppard/RedfernsI’ve heard a lot of people say that Miles doesn’t have as much technical brilliance as other players but the live recording ofLady Bird from 1951is what I use to defend him. During these earlier years you can clearly hear that he got to a state of technical excellence and found his sound within bebop to play fast and high and that ultimately, as his artistry progressed, he actually chose not to continue with that sound. He’s like Picasso being able to paint and draw proficiently before going down another path.Miles is one of the first musicians to utilise the trumpet not just for its staccato brilliance but as a melodic songbird. He showed trumpet players like me that we could shift down instead of up to find a beautiful quality that lies within the instrument. The more I transcribe his work into my older age, the more the idiosyncratic details of his playing become apparent to me. You realise how the melody is so paramount to him and he gives a lot more time to digest what he’s played rather than play a million notes all the time. He’s a deep thinker.View image in fullscreenConstant questioning … Miles Davis in Italy, 1987.Photograph: Luciano Viti/Getty ImagesPlaying alongside a fictionalised Miles Davis in the stage show I’ve recently been a part of [Miles.], I’m able to understand him more, and his life. I can appreciate the drive he had to overcome the racial tensions of the era he lived in. To become a superstar in that environment is so rare and it means he wasn’t always the nicest guy. Yet his music always feels so warm and human.Bill Evans: ‘He taught me to trust my instincts’View image in fullscreenBill Evans and Miles Davis in concert, 1985.Photograph: Christian RoseMiles had a way of writing a song or putting a band together that felt like he was playing to just one person, it was very personal and it’s something I try to emulate.I ended up in his band as his saxophonist Dave Liebman recommended me and then I in turn recommended [bassist] Marcus Miller, [guitarist] Mike Stern and John Scofield. He taught me to always trust my instincts and play the music I’m inspired to play and write. He told me: “You, Wayne Shorter, Herbie Hancock – I don’t worry about you guys. There will always be a place in music for you. Be yourself.”People love icons and Miles was a born leader; he was charismatic and he helped change the sound of the trumpet. Even though there were more trumpet players with better technique, Miles had his own sound.Ambrose Akinmusire: ‘I love his leather-clad 80s period’View image in fullscreenAmbrose Akinmusire.Photograph: Michael WilsonI don’t see Miles Davis as a composer but instead like a producer or conductor. He’s a great trumpet player but he’s also a guy who loves spectacle and changing himself and his band completely with each new era. He always looked and talked like his albums and it was hard to tell where the art ended and he began since it was all one thing. I love his later 80s period when he is wearing leather, embracing electronics, backbeats and hip-hop and giving his platform over to another generation.The thing I love about Miles is the same thing I love about Dizzy Gillespie or Joni Mitchell or Björk, which is that they ask themselves daily if they’re the same person they were yesterday. It’s this constant questioning that is important and it’s what I try to implement with myself too.I’ve played with a lot of Miles’s band members over the years, from Jack DeJohnette to Dave Holland, Wayne Shorter, Herbie Hancock and Ron Carter, and they’re all actively invested in the youth and the continuation of the music too. They don’t just play with their peers, they have a continued commitment to passing this music down and they’re ever changing. That’s Miles’s legacy for me, to keep moving and flip your whole shit if you need to.Yazz Ahmed: ‘Jazz students still have a reverence for him’View image in fullscreenYazz Ahmed at Womad, July 2022.Photograph: JEP Live Music/AlamyI love Miles’s record Live-Evil because it’s an incredible mix of live tracks and studio compositions edited together. It’s so ahead of its time and the first track on the album, Sivad, is an incredible overture that sums up what’s about to come next. The rhythm and phrasing of Miles’s opening line on the track is reminiscent of early hip-hop, a few years before hip-hop was even in popular consciousness, while the whole album is also really inspired by Jimi Hendrix and so on that first phrase he’s using a wah-wah pedal to sound like a guitar. There is an exciting and beautiful contrast where he takes the pedal away and you hear his natural sound – it’s almost shocking. The second movement comes from a Keith Jarrett piano riff and then there’s a brutal studio edit that goes into a ballad-like piece, which is such a surprise again.View image in fullscreenKind Of Blue, 1959.Photograph: Madi/AlamyMiles’s melodic playing is so distinctive since he’s such a great, spontaneous composer: it’s a real skill to play melodic compositions on the spot. Whenever I’ve taught jazz students, there’s still a reverence for Miles and they’re very aware of Kind of Blue – they can sing all of his solos on it.Brandon Woody: ‘The intensity is not in the volume. It’s in the intention’View image in fullscreenBrandon Woody in Baltimore, April 2025.Photograph: The Washington Post/Getty ImagesSorcerer is an album from Miles’s second great quintet, who produced some of my favourite music. I love the way that group played together and even though Herbie Hancock wrote the tune The Sorcerer, Miles breathes such life into the composition because the group was so locked in and vulnerable with each other after spending so much time touring and playing together. I love the way the melody feels like a sorcerer or a snake constantly moving around – it’s so connected to the energy of the song.There is so much belief in every note Miles plays. The intensity is not in the volume of the sound, it’s in the intention behind it. I’m a 27-year-old player and it’s something a lot of us young cats had to learn early on. Miles would leave space for the rhythm section to support him and he would really allow the band to fly. His sound comes from the group, never from the individual.Nobody else spanned so many genres as Miles, and his groups were always intergenerational – he was keeping the pulse of what was relevant. Even at the end of his life, his technique isn’t as good but the music never suffered for it: his sound and confidence is present in every note.Miles.is at Southwark Playhouse, Borough, London, from 4 February to 7 MarchExplore more on these topicsMiles DavisJazzSonny RollinsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Now a palatial hotel, it is just over a mile from the town and its Pampelonne beach, where the director Roger Vadim shot the film And God Created Woman, launching Brigitte Bardot to stardom.The property’swebsitestates it was originally commissioned by the wealthy cognac trader Gabriel Dupuy d’Angeac as a wedding gift to his daughter Louise and her husband, Henry Brisson de la Messardière, a cavalry officer.

The production is expected to last for six months. Other cast members include AJ Michalka, Alexander Ludwig and the Australian actor Caleb Jonte Edwards. HBO has not confirmed a release date, but it is unlikely to be before 2027.White’s research for the new series will surely have uncovered a useful plot device: the Messardière family motto, dating back to the 8th-century Carolingian dynasty, is said to bevictor et inermisor “victorious and unarmed”.Explore more on these topicsThe White LotusFranceSteve CooganHelena Bonham CarterEuropefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Nevertheless he swings, he swoons, he balances with limbs entwined around the narrow bars, reaching up to an imagined starry sky (it’s actually the high ceiling of aRoyal Balletrehearsal studio in Covent Garden). This is the iconic opening of the ballet Pierrot Lunaire, where a childlike clown is wonderstruck by the sight of the moon.View image in fullscreenEccentric, challenging … Bob Powell (left) and Glen Tetley perform in Tetley’s ballet in 1962.Photograph: Jack Mitchell/Getty ImagesMade in 1962 by the US choreographer Glen Tetley – whose centenary is celebrated this year – Pierrot Lunaire is a distinctive, eccentric, challenging work, set to Arnold Schoenberg’s atonal song cycle of the same name. It’s based on poems by Albert Giraud, delivered insprechstimme, a vocal style halfway between song and speech that sounds sometimes like singsong nursery rhymes, elsewhere like a ghostly aural apparition. The ballet is not regularly performed – the last time the RoyalBalletdanced it was 20 years ago – but it has a special status in the ballet rep, as a pioneering example of blending modern dance with classical, and as a juicy role for its male lead as the sad clown Pierrot, the commedia dell’arte stock character here given an emotional journey of surprising depth. It was Rudolf Nureyev’s favourite ballet, apparently.This season Pierrot will be danced alternately by Royal Ballet principal Sambé, one of the company’s leading men, and soloist Joshua Junker. Sambé is much loved for his winningly sunny energy but here he’s tapping into his wide-eyed vulnerable side, as Pierrot’s hopeful naivety is punctured by encounters with Columbine, the object of his unrequited affection, and the antagonist Brighella, whom Tetley called “the dark clown of experience”.“For a while I found it really hard connecting with this piece,” says Sambé, seeing the stock character as two-dimensional, but working with Christopher Bruce, who was a famed interpreter of the role in the 1960s, unlocked it. “What makes it so poignant and emotional is that this archetype is full of human traces,” says Sambé. “It’s about bringing something of my DNA to it. It’s deeply layered, comedic but based in darkness, a place of huge contemplation, self-discovery and curiosity.”View image in fullscreen'It’s scary!’ … Marcelino Sambé, left, and Mathew Ball rehearsing Pierrot Lunaire.Photograph: Andrej UspenskiJunker sees the piece as a journey from innocence into adulthood and its harsh realisations: “There is pain, there’s suffering, there’s responsibility”. “It’s a really symbolic piece,” he says. “Brighella is his own character but also represents Pierrot’s internal relationship with himself, like the shadow in Jungian psychology.”Both dancers initially found the music a challenge. “In the beginning I was horrified by it!” says Sambé. He’d previously danced to Schoenberg’s earlier, more Romantic string sextet Verklärte Nacht, which he loved, “but this was probably his least accessible work for me.” The mercurial sounds of the small instrumental ensemble and the soprano’s swooping delivery makes for a mood that’s eerie, fantastical, funny and strange. Music is often a rhythmic driver for a dancer, “but with this score, music becomes a feeling,” says Sambé. “Almost like an organism in itself, with its own veins and blood.” He’s acclimatised to it. “Now I find myself in the kitchen, chopping onions, listening to Pierrot Lunaire.”View image in fullscreen‘Intimate’ … Joshua Junker in rehearsals.Photograph: Andrej UspenskiTetley himself was the first Pierrot. His early dance career in the 1940s and 50s was spent with classical companies (Joffrey Ballet, American Ballet Theatre) and at the vanguard of modern dance, working with Hanya Holm and Martha Graham. He brought all of those influences to his own choreography, mixing a more contemporary use of the body with classical steps – revolutionary at the time. He was instrumental in bringing that style to the UK as well, helping the company then called Ballet Rambert transition into a modern dance troupe.Pierrot Lunaire is 40 minutes long and, unusually, for these performances the ballet will be performed as a standalone piece, rather than as part of a double or triple bill. “It’s going to be a very intimate experience,” says Junker. “Just the three of us, close up on a small stage, so there can be a real focus on the dancers and the music.” (The music will be played live.) Sambé describes it as “putting a magnifying glass to [Tetley’s] vision”. Learning the ballet has been an education for Sambé, “to understand a bit more about this modernist moment in dance, the influence of Martha Graham and this new age of movement, the high level of craftsmanship.”He’s inspired by the fact that choreographers and composers of the era were deliberately challenging their audience. “It’s something that is confronting, not just ballet that is comforting,” he says. “We don’t experience work so much like this any more, at least in the dance that I see. It’s going to be uncomfortable and funny, poignant, sad and beautiful at the same time,” he predicts. “It leaves you with more questions. And I love work like that.”Pierrot Lunaire is atLinbury theatre, London, 10-20 FebruaryExplore more on these topicsDanceClownsRoyal BalletBalletfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But a muddled approach has led to indecision and paralysisFri 30 Jan 2026 09.17 ESTLast modified on Fri 30 Jan 2026 11.48 ESTShareAlong time ago, in a galaxy far, far away,Star Warswas an actual movie that people watched. It drew people to cinemas in huge numbers, largely because it was completely unembarrassed about being a pulpy space adventure about comic wizards and laser swords. Nowadays, it is something else entirely. A TV show about a likable space dad and his cute, cheeky, telekinetically powered adopted alien son, or perhaps a divisive culture-war bellwether that vacillates between trying to destroy itself in a blaze of operatic self-importance and hamfistedly rebuilding itself.These days Star Wars also seems mainly to be press releases and announcements, throwaway comments in interviews that gesture mournfully towards what once was and what might, one day, be again. Which brings us to Taika Waititi, the Oscar-winning director from New Zealand, who has been giving fresh updates on his episode in the long-running space saga. “I’m just trying to sort of go back and harness a little bit more of the fun from the original films,”he told Variety, adding of George Lucas’ original trilogy: “The stakes were very high [and] there were serious things going on but also there was a lot fun to be had in those films. That’s what I was trying to bring back.”This sounds like a perfectly reasonable way forward, until we recall that Waititi was first tipped to make one of these films six years ago and that nothing much has happened since. Most of us only remembered that the New Zealander had once signed on to this thing because Kathleen Kennedy, the outgoing Lucasfilm president, described the proposed film as “still somewhat alive” in an“exit” interview earlier this month with Deadline. Other once-mooted projects that still might one day make it to production apparently include Donald Glover’s idea for a Lando Calrissian movie and a possible new trilogy from Simon Kinberg. Kennedy even suggested Adam Driver and Steven Soderbergh’s mysterious Hunt for Ben Solo script,which caused a minor buzz when its existence was revealed by the actor last year, might have a chance to get made “if somebody’s willing to take a risk”.Less was said about the once much-hyped New Jedi Order film that was announced at Star Wars Celebration 2023, with Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy directing and Daisy Ridley’s Rey as the central character. Reports this week suggest that Ridley won’t be returning in next year’s Star Wars: Starfighter, which Ryan Gosling is set to headline.Screenwriter Jonathan Tropper told Screenrantthe film features “no legacy characters”, adding: “You’re not going to see any of the characters you’ve seen in the other movies.”View image in fullscreenMuch anticipated … Pedro Pascal in a scene from The Mandalorian series, which hits the big screen in May.Photograph: APThis could of course be typical Hollywood smoke and mirrors, though few fans are really clamouring for the return ofanyof the characters from the sequel trilogy. So awful and misguided was the last entry, 2019’sThe Rise of Skywalker, that the idea that Star Wars could wheel out Rey, Finn, Poe Dameron (or anyone else from the recent films) to gasps of wonder is laughable.Instead, next up for the saga isThe Mandalorian& Grogu, a big screen segue for a TV series that pretty much everyone likes. And yet even here there are naysayers, pointing out that director Jon Favreau and new Lucasfilm president Dave Filoni could have just given us season four instead. The show has everything Star Wars fans want: nostalgia, lore expansion, charm and knockabout space larks, and yet bringing it to the big screen does feel a little bit like cheating, as if theatrical relevance is now something that has to be reverse-engineered from streaming success.The problem, perhaps, is that Lucasfilm has spent so long palpably having no idea what Star Wars is supposed to be, and where it should be going. Some would inexplicably rather see Driver firing up the crossguard lightsaber again; others want something entirely new, provided it also feels exactly like the old thing they loved.What this leaves Star Wars with, yet again, is not a creative crisis so much as an identity standoff: a franchise paralysed by its own audience, endlessly triangulating between comfort, novelty and outrage, and somehow managing to disappoint people even when it gives them what they asked for.Explore more on these topicsFilmWeek in geekStar WarsThe MandalorianTaika WaititiScience fiction and fantasy filmsTelevisioncommentShareReuse this content"

Everyone is thinking twice about going there at the moment.”May did not specify the particular dangers they might face, but his comments come at a time when many American citizens and foreign visitors fear violence from ICE agents or examination of their political beliefs, and the threat of mass shootings – 425 such incidents in 2025, killing 420 people and wounding 1,898 – remains ever present.The British dance music star Piri cited “what’s going on in the US right now” as a factor when she cancelled a US tour earlier this week. In 2025, the Hungarian classical pianist András Schiff cancelled US concerts, saying: “Due to the recent and unprecedented political changes in the United States, I feel morally obligated to withdraw from all engagements in the US.”Bad Bunny says he left US out of world tour due to fear of Ice raids at concertsRead moreAlso in 2025, Puerto Rican megastar Bad Bunny was asked by i-D magazine if the reason he didn’t schedule any US concerts last year was due to fears about deportation of Latino audience members. “Man, honestly, yes,” he replied. “There were many reasons why I didn’t show up in the US, and none of them were out of hate … But there was the issue of – like, fucking ICE could be outside [a concert]. And it’s something that we were talking about and very concerned about.”Numerous events celebrating Latin heritage and culture have been cancelled since ICE ramped up activity during Donald Trump’s second term, due to fears they will be targeted by anti-immigration agents.There are concerns beyond arts and cultural events, particularly around this year’s World Cup being hosted mostly in the US, and the implications for thousands of fans travelling from abroad.The US is seeing a collapse in tourism revenue. In May 2025, the World Travel & Tourism Council projected that the US would lose $12.5bn (£9.35bn) in international visitor spending across the year. Figures later in the year supported that fall, with International Trade Administration, a US government body, finding that international visitor spending dropped 5.5% in September 2025 compared with September 2024.Fears were compounded by the proposal by the US Department for Homeland Security and border officials to examine five years of social media activity by potential visitors to the US prior to being granted entry.Queen are currently on a break from touring, after the end of their Rhapsody tour which ran from 2019 to 2024, featuring Adam Lambert as frontman.As May describes, they have a rich history in the US. After breaking into the mainstream there with third album Sheer Heart Attack, they had five US Top 10 albums in a row, reaching No 1 with 1980’s The Game which featured two US No 1 singles: Another One Bites the Dust and Crazy Little Thing Called Love, the latter a clear homage to Elvis Presley and American rock’n’roll.Explore more on these topicsBrian MayPop and rockICE (US Immigration and Customs Enforcement)newsShareReuse this content"

The Time Traveler’s Wife has sold more than 9m copies globally since its publication, and was adapted into a 2009 film starring Rachel McAdams, as well as an HBO series anda musical.The new book – due to be published on 27 October by Jonathan Cape, an imprint of Penguin, in the UK – is about the life of Alba DeTamble, the daughter of Henry and Clare, who are the characters at the centre of the original novel.Niffenegger wrote The Time Traveler’s Wife between 1997 and 2002, and “had no intention of writing any kind of sequel”. It was only years later that she had an idea for a follow-up story about Alba, which she began in November 2012.In the Time Traveler’s Wife, we learn that Henry has “Chrono-Displacement Disorder”, meaning he involuntarily travels through time, always arriving naked at his destination. Alba inherits the condition. In the original book, Henry dies when Alba is five.The sequel is partly about love – the “seed” of the book is Alba having two husbands, Zach and Oliver – in two different time periods, with an overlap – says Niffenegger.When Niffenegger began writing the sequel, Obama had just been re-elected; it was “a different world”. As she continued writing, “the world around me was changing quite a lot, and the book started getting more and more political”.Alba was born six days before 9/11, so Niffenegger realised that if she wanted to write about her protagonist as an adult, she would need to “take some guesses” about what the future might be like. “I thought, OK, that’s probably got a lot to do with climate change. So I started writing in that direction, and of course it rapidly turned into a dystopia, and then I thought, well, let’s bring some politics to bear on this situation. But I would put something in the book, and then it would happen in real life, and that got to be distressing. And then 2016 came and just blew everything up. Alba’s dystopia and my dystopia started looking similar.”Alba is a violinist and composer, so “something that keeps popping its head up here and there is, well, if the world’s going to shit, why make art? But my own feeling about that is that we make things for ourselves, and we make them for other people, and we make them to connect, and to document our thinking, and sometimes change our own minds. So, even if you knew the world was imploding tomorrow, you should still get out there and make things and do things.” Niffenegger is hoping the book “encourages people to be more ‘out there’, more active, in art, in politics, in their lives”.In Life Out of Order, Alba “is haunted by secrets she must keep from those she loves most, including Zach, her supportive anchor in the chaos, and Oliver, a fellow time traveller and musician,” reads the publisher’s description of the book. “Her journey takes her from the riots of Chicago’s streets to the eerie refuge of the Yellow House, to the digital corridors of the Museum of Lost Souls, a virtual sanctuary of forgotten memories and lost artefacts.”Niffenegger “had always thought a female time traveller would have a rough time running around in her nakedity and just getting harassed all the time”, she explains. “And then I thought, what if she had a place that was secluded, that was her own?” – much like the meadow in the original book, which is a meeting place for Henry and Clare. In the sequel, Alba is drawn to the Yellow House when she time travels – a Victorian-era property she has owned since before she was born, located in the Ravenswood neighbourhood of Chicago.The author described writing Life Out of Order as “all-consuming”, but said she will miss “living in it”.The Time Traveler’s Wife “was one of the most significant literary publications in history,” said Hannah Westland, publisher at Jonathan Cape. Life Out of Order is “uncannily of this moment” and a “profoundly moving celebration of love”. Vintage, the imprint of Penguin that oversees Jonathan Cape, will also publish new paperback and hardback editions of the original book this year.Explore more on these topicsThe Time Traveler's WifeAudrey NiffeneggernewsShareReuse this content"

So there’s a fine balance to be located and the question of exactly who this is aimed at is never quite resolved. Still, the anarchic energy ofthe gangshould transcend generational barriers. There’s simmering beef between Miss Piggy and guest Sabrina Carpenter, cameos from Seth Rogen and Maya Rudolph, self-aware musical spoofs, snark from Statler and Waldorf and much more besides. If anything, the special tries to squeeze too much in, which is perhaps a hint that a new series might be the next logical and welcome step?Phil HarrisonDisney+, from Wednesday 4 FebruaryThe Investigation of Lucy LetbyView image in fullscreenTroubling … The Investigation of Lucy Letby.Photograph: NetflixGiven the horror of the crimes for which she was convicted and the questions around the safety of that sentence, it’s unlikely that we’ll be short of documentaries about theLucy Letbycase in the coming years. This film includes previously unseen footage of her arrest and questioning, but doesn’t add a great deal to anyone’s understanding of the charges against her. There’s also a brisk summary of the uncertainties surrounding the case, including the lack of motive, the procedural issues at the hospital in question and the troubling question: if Lucy Letby didn’t kill seven babies, why did they die?PHNetflix, from Wednesday 4 FebruaryMo Gilligan: In the MovementView image in fullscreenBrit in America … Mo Gilligan: In the Movement.Photograph: Matt FrostPopular London comicMo Gilliganhas decamped to the United States – and has been rewarded with his first Netflix standup special. As ever, it’s solid if gentle observational comedy from Gilligan, honed during years of nicely judged red carpet and award ceremony banter. Over the course of the set, he makes the most of his new outsider status to ponder the experience of being a Brit in America, talks about the effect of fame on his family and explores the many manifestations of “the ick” (gentlemen: never ever put on your T-shirt before your boxers).PHNetflix, from Tuesday 3 FebruaryIs It Cake?

As ever, the irrepressible Mikey Day presides over the whole absurd confection. The items rendered (or not?) in flour, eggs and icing (by a selection of real-life couples) include gigantic red lips, candles, chocolate boxes, romantic novels, bottles of wine and, inevitably, many cakey-breaky hearts. Like the treat at the show’s centre, it’s entirely without nutritional value but as part of a balanced diet extremely hard to resist.Netflix, from Wednesday 4 FebruaryQueen of ChessView image in fullscreenGripping … Judit Polgár, Susan Polgár and Sofia Polgár in Queen of Chess.Photograph: NetflixThis gripping documentary lands like a real-life version ofThe Queen’s Gambit, exploring the story ofJudit Polgár, a Hungarian girl who dreamed of conquering the world of elite chess. The sexism she faced is remarkable – according to one interviewee, women lack both the logical reasoning and emotional restraint to excel. Polgár’s journey towards proving him wrong began when she broke into the world top 100 at the age of 12 and culminated in a 15-year battle against Garry Kasparov, which contained both game-playing innovation and huge controversy.Netflix, from Friday 6 FebruaryArctic CircleView image in fullscreenA taste for the bizarre … Kari Ketonen and Iina Kuustonen in Arctic Circle.Photograph: Channel 4This Finnish show distinguishes itself from comparable crime dramas via its taste for the bizarre. The fourth season is a case in point: nothing as mundane as a serial killer here – instead, a mysterious series of deaths at a retirement home is eventually linked to an astronomical event that occurred two millennia previously. Once again, police chief Nina Kautsalo is charged with unravelling a baffling situation which expands to include space exploration, international terrorism, the revival of a religious sect and a visiting astrophysicist sticking his nose in.Channel 4, from Friday 6 FebruaryFinding Harmony:A King’s VisionView image in fullscreenMaverick? … King Charles in the Arboretum at Highgrove House.Photograph: Millie Pilkington/Buckingham PalaceIt’s hard to imagine his late mother giving even a moment’s consideration to being the subject of an intimate documentary on Prime Video.

However, don’t expect anything remotely “warts and all” – this is a carefully choreographed affair, mainly exploring the king’s lifelong commitment to promoting respect for nature and sustainability via the King’s Foundation.

The book was either Charlie and the Chocolate Factory or its sequel, Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator, both byRoald Dahl.My favourite book growing upI loved Stuart Little, and all his small, clever things – his tiny canoe, his tiny sailboat. He had such a relaxed demeanor and was so dapper! I also loved Mary Norton’s The Borrowers series – tiny people living under the floorboards and improvising household goods out of “borrowed” safety pins and match boxes and so on. Clearly I had a thing for miniatures.The book that changed me as a teenagerDonald Barthelme’s Sixty Stories, because he was having such a good time and seemed so so smart, but was also mischievous and irreverent. It may sound corny but these stories made me grasp the existence of a world of art and literature. And Barthelme lived in Houston, where I was growing up, yet he was a major world writer.The writer who changed my mindIn the early 90s, while I was in graduate school, I readSigrid Nunez’sshort story Chang, which later became a portion of her first book, A Feather on the Breath of God. “Chang” had a seismic effect on me. Up to that point, I can’t recall having ever seen a multiracial character in fiction. I was so accustomed to the default whiteness of fictional characters that I didn’t even notice the absence of characters from other backgrounds. And even as I was trying at that time to write short stories about my father’s life in Korea, I would give those characters white-sounding, European-sounding names, as if I was hoping to disguise their specificity. It really pains me now to look back on this tendency in my writing, which proceeded directly from the sorts of writers I was taking as models, like Virginia Woolf and Henry James. When I read Sigrid’s story I was astonished that the narrator was the daughter of a white European woman and a brown Asian man – just like me! I hadn’t realised this sort of character was possible. It’s sort of heartbreaking that my thinking was so constricted, but the disruption to that thinking was thrilling.The book that made me want to be a writerI wanted to be a writer from such an early age it’s impossible to choose a single book to hold responsible, but the book that made me want to be a certain kind of writer wasTo the Lighthouse. I so desperately wanted to write the way Virginia Woolf does in that book that it made my writing insufferable for a very long time.The book I rereadThe Great Gatsby by F Scott Fitzgerald, which I despised at school, but now I’ve come to love the way I love certain comfort foods. It’s not the most nutritious and in some ways it’s repulsive, but the deep familiarity of it always hit the spot.Theauthor I came back toCharles Dickens. For so long I associated him with unbearable Christmas television specials, so I didn’t actually sit down and try reading him until shockingly late, and then I was enthralled. I read Bleak House for the first time during the pandemic – it was one of the great reading experiences of my life.The book I could never read againAnything by Tom Robbins. Another Roadside Attraction, Even Cowgirls Get the Blues, Jitterbug Perfume: they seemed great in my teens but now even just the titles make me cringe.The book I discovered later in lifeHomer’s Odyssey. Obviously I’d heard of it and must have read it for the first time in college, but it wasn’t until recently that I became completely fascinated by it and started wanting to reread it in different translations.The book I am currently readingI recently finishedJA Baker’s The Peregrine, which is one of the most extraordinary books I have ever read. It’s quite short, but the writing is so uncategorisable,immersive and transformative that I felt as if I’d been sucked into a different time-medium.Flashlight by Susan Choi will be published in paperback by Vintage next month (£10.99).

While the cliche involves the purchase of a Porsche or a frantic fling with a colleague, I’ve mainly fallen back into the geeky preoccupations of my youth, such as founding poetry clubs and playing niche racket sports. Nevertheless, on the cusp of turning 50, and having just been beaten by my 11-year-old at Scrabble, I’m thrilled to have found a book that addresses my small struggle: an elegant discourse on the deep wisdom that I’m hoping will characterise my remaining years.First, the author, a clinical psychologist named Frank Tallis, diagnoses the problem. Following some ofthe argumentsin Ernest Becker’s 1973 study The Denial of Death, he proposes that such crises are at least partly the result of the western reluctance to face mortality. In Britain, we eschew open coffins, for instance. When our relatives die, as my mother did two years ago, they die in a hospital rather than at home. We can hardly even bring ourselves to say “die”, preferring euphemisms such as “pass away”. In this Instagram age, our lives are dominated by filters and distractions. The crisis strikes when reality can’t be held at bay any longer. We lose our parents. Then we notice, inevitably, that we are now at the front of the queue.Carl Jung had a breakdown in his late 30s, then decided that such an ordeal was a necessary ‘descent to the underworld’Next, the author offers comfort where it’s needed. The transformative message of this short, thought-provoking book is that, rather than regarding such a mental logjam as shameful, we can embrace and even recast it as heroic. As the author Joseph Campbell pointed out, the myth that recurs across cultures sees a hero descending to the underworld. This literal and figurative low point turns out to be a pivotal moment, leading to triumphs and resolutions of the second act. In Homer, I now realise, it is while visiting the land of the dead that Odysseus first learns that his mother has died. Comparably, the opening of Dante’s Inferno is: “In the middle of life’s journey, I found myself in a dark wood, unable to discover the path ahead.”A midlife crisis doesn’t seem so bad after learning that Odysseus and Dante had one. And Carl Jung, for that matter. The Swiss psychologist had a breakdown in his late 30s, then conveniently decided that such an ordeal was a necessary “descent to the underworld”, preceding the fertile plains of mature life, where we may find peace through wisdom.So what is wisdom, exactly? The structure of this book, which proceeds chronologically through the standard stages of a midlife crisis and what follows (Chapter 1: Denial, Chapter 2: Acceptance, etc), hints that an answer may be forthcoming towards the end. Yet Tallis ultimately ducks it, preferring to keep his opinions to himself. As Nietzsche noted: “No one can build you the bridge on which you and only you must cross the river of life.” One rare swoop into the personal is the author’s confession that, in his late teens, he was hoodwinked into joining a cult (“it was the 1970s,” he explains apologetically), loosening ties with his family and making regrettable financial donations, much to the dismay of his father.As the psychoanalyst and author Anthony Storr once remarked, a striking number of self-proclaimed messiahs found their calling while in the grip of a midlife crisis. Although this is a psychological knight’s move that is probably best avoided, it is true that the search for meaning can save us. Some branches of therapy are devoted to it, inspired by Viktor Frankl’s observation, during his time in the Nazi camps, that the inmates who survived longest were those who clung on to some sense of meaning amid the mindless butchery.What will I take away from Wise, apart from the memory of remaining gripped throughout its 200-plus pages? It’s too soon to say. Perhaps to live more in the company of death, as the Stoics advised, to make it less of a monster. Probably to read some books that get named here, like Frankl’s and Becker’s. And undoubtedly to reread this one, which I sincerely recommend.Wise: Finding Purpose, Meaning and Wisdom Beyond the Midpoint of Life by Frank Tallis is published by Abacus (£22).

But behind a rising number of films is a simple hack: pinch all your dialogue from real people. An increasing number of film-makers are turning to transcripts and recordings to re-enact episodes on film, with the promise that they are as an exact a facsimile as possible. FromReality (2023), Tina Satter’s true-to-life portrayal of whistleblower Reality Winner, which progresses in real time from harmless small talk to a full-blown FBI grilling, toRadu Jude’s Uppercase Print (2020), in which a rebel teen is given the third degree in Ceaușescu-era Romania, the title-card proclamation “inspired by true events” is being taken to a wholly literal new level.Within the space of a month, two more “verbatim” movies are in UK cinemas.Peter Hujar’s Day, Ira Sachs’ time capsule of 1974 New York and its colourful culturati, is based on candid conversation between Linda Rosenkrantz (Rebecca Hall) and her photographer pal Peter (Ben Whishaw), who would die from an Aids-related illness less than a decade later. Meanwhile,Kaouther Ben Hania’s The Voice of Hind Rajabis set in January 2024 amid the evacuation of Gaza City, revisiting beat for beat an emergency call centre’s attempts to rescue the six-year-old girl of the title to harrowing effect.There is a precedent in the industry for following sources to the letter. Films includingSophie Scholl: The Final Days(2005), Conspiracy: The Trial of the Chicago 8 (1987),The Beast (2023)and even Christopher Nolan’sOppenheimer (2023)have all flirted with word-for-word adaptation, but the first bona fide verbatim feature film came as far back as 2015.London Roadwas stage director Rufus Norris’s second feature; adapted from the National Theatre’s 2011 production of the same name, it is a curious tale of community spirit sparked by the grisly Ipswich serial murders, featuring a curtain-twitching Olivia Colman and a taxi-driving Tom Hardy. Adam Cork and Alecky Blythe’s script repeats what the real residents of London Road said in the aftermath of the killings, making the bold creative decision to set their remarks to music.View image in fullscreenCaught on tape … Ben Whishaw as the photographer in Peter Hujar’s Day.Photograph: © One Two FilmsIt is not unusual for verbatim adaptations to have theatrical roots. Uppercase Print started out as a play by Gianina Cărbunariu, while Reality Winner’s interrogation transcript (originally leaked to Politico) was first repurposed by Satter for her 2019 theatre performance Is This a Room. On the stage,the genre has a long lineage,withthe idea of a “living newspaper” going back to the 1930s Federal Theatre Projectin the US, which tackled hot-button topics during the Great Depression. The House Committe on Un-American Activitieshearings of the 1950salso provided the fodder for Eric Bentley’s acclaimed early 70s play Are You Now or Have You Ever Been?Interestingly, the verbatim style has crossed from stage to screen at a moment when hybrid documentaries – an experimental form straddling fact and fiction – also seem to be gaining traction. (This year’s contributions includeFiume o Morte!, Blue Heron andThe Wolves Always Come at Night. More widely, 120 documentaries and non-fiction films were released in UK cinemas in 2025, according to figures from box office analysts Comscore, grossing £8.6m – an admittedly tiny 0.8 percent of2025’s UK total of £1.07bn– but still significantly better than 2001 when just four documentaries were shown in cinemas. Fiction film-making undeniably still dominates.View image in fullscreenWhistleblower … Sydney Sweeney in Reality.Photograph: Screen Grab/APReality is often stranger than fiction, so perhaps film-makers have concluded that packaging real events in a wrapping of drama is the best way to grab viewers, cut through the noise of the news cycle and address hard truths. Transcripts that hold dramatic potential require minimal editing, with the speakers helpfully listed, asSatter observed, “like characters in a play”. Thanks to Hujar’s natural eloquence, Sachs needed few tweaks for a poetic script. Ben Hania also said that no alterations needed to be made to Hind Rajab’s story, since what is unfolding in Gaza is “something that is beyond fiction”.Another hallmark of the new verbatim wave isvéritécinematography, featuring closeups, handheld cameras and natural lighting, designed to create a sense of immediacy and direct engagement with the film’s subjects. The Voice of Hind Rajab combines dizzying closeups of its cast along with actual recordings of the girl at its centre. There is an obvious appeal in hewing near to reality when current events are increasingly harder to reckon with. In Ben Hania’s film, verbatim performances and recordings are an important part of being faithful to Hind’s story and enabling her to be heard – with a voice that speaks for itself.Explore more on these topicsFilmPeter HujarReality WinnerDrama filmsDocumentary filmsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It was the Ulster immigrants, passing down their boisterous tunes and melancholy ballads, who gifted the US some of its first iterations of country music.Composer Finn Anderson and director Tania Azevedo have used that journey to tell a musical story across generations. Our starting point is New York couple Sarah and Alix, moving into their new home and Marie Kondo-ing a mystery box sent to Sarah by a dying aunt. It turns out to contain audio tapes tracing song origins back up the family line, a reconnection to Sarah’s West Virginia roots that is first unwelcome and then increasingly transformative.No kidding: this music would move anyone. Anderson’s score powerfully evokes the source material it is exploring, and the ensemble’s singing positively electrifies the traditional songs – The Four Marys, Handsome Molly – that he incorporates and adapts with the fluidity that has accompanied them down the centuries.View image in fullscreenTransformative … the ensemble of Ballad Lines.Photograph: Pamela RaithIn a nearly all-female cast, Kirsty Findlay breaks the heart as Cait, a spirited but troubled Scottish minister’s wife living in the 1600s. Meanwhile Yna Tresvalles teases the wit from the script as 18th-century Londonderry teenager Jean (“If God didn’t want us tempted, he wouldn’t have invented sailors”). It’s their respective pregnancies that fuel the show’s themes of motherhood and choice – the act-one number, Unexpected Visitor, is a standout – and which rather outshine the contemporary story.With brilliant support from Sian Louise Dowdalls as Jean’s vociferous sister and Ally Kennard – who brings a vital empathy to all the male roles – it’s hard not to find yourself wishing these characters back on stage in some of the New York scenes. Aunt Betty emerges from her largely narrative role only late in the day, and the ending delivers its message with all the subtlety to be expected of a voice from the grave.Still, there’s no faulting any of the vocal performances in this full-throated, folk-energy production (not least in a stirring second-half flatfooting number). It’s a worthy tribute to the music it loves – here’s hoping the show can share it more widely.AtSouthwark Playhouse Borough, London, until 21 MarchExplore more on these topicsMusicalsTheatreSouthwark PlayhouseFolk musicCountryreviewsShareReuse this content"

It is all about artifice, after all, and interrogates the construction of art as illusion through Prospero’s rough magic. So its pairing with experimental writer-actor-director Tim Crouch seems like a natural one. Or rather non-naturalist because this painfully high-concept production comprehensively underlines its artifice.It emphatically punctures the fourth wall until the drama becomes leaden with messages about theatre, and the act of watching is draining. Maybe this is the point? Actors often sit in a circle, barely moving, as if in rehearsal. At times they trip up in their lines, which are occasionally finished off by another or spoken in unison.Miniature models that symbolise characters who fetch in from the shipwreck are laid out in a row as their stories are narrated, to suggest that the act of storytelling, and make-believe, is a form of control and manipulation.Crouch plays Prospero and is a cross between a curmudgeonly farmer and festivalgoer with a hint of Worzel Gummidge. Miranda (Sophie Steer) is playful and stroppy by turns. Caliban (Faizal Abdullah) wears a Gascoigne football jersey and flip-flops, with nothing of the “monster” about him. Ariel (Naomi Wirthner) is decidedly unspritely, with a sombre, wise-owl watchfulness, in an embroidered dress denoting the indigenous culture of this island. It is clear that both characters have rejected Prospero’s definition of them and Caliban occasionally speaks in Singaporean Malay – to resist his definitions and dominion as a whole?View image in fullscreenFarmer-festivalgoer … Tim Crouch as Prospero.Photograph: Marc BrennerThe production also reduces Prospero’s lines, parcelling them out to other characters. It’s interesting as a concept but where does this post-colonial decentring fit in with Prospero as the all-controlling coloniser that the play, and this production, also asserts?Actors emerge from among the audience, some standing up from their seats, some pushing their way to the stage, and then returning to watch the play afterwards. It is invigorating when this first happens – funny, transgressive and original. It is the same when singers pop up in gangways and balconies, and makes literal Crouch’s preoccupation with active audience engagement (although the actors here are “acting” as the audience).Who is audience and who is actor, you wonder, and that is a thrilling idea but the trick is played again and again until it feels educational, like something is being taught to us in these fractures of theatrical convention. For a play that deals with artifice with such agility, the exposure of its artifice feels wooden here and over-emphatic.When it works it sparks, dangerously, as when Prospero stops mid-sentence and asks an audience member to put their phone away. Is this for real or part of the play? And Rachana Jadhav’s set is a thing of beauty, with a museum-like quality of contested “exotic” artefacts belonging to other lands, and a model boat spun around when Prospero conjures his storm.Toto Kerblammo! review – Tim Crouch offers up doggy delight and human heartacheRead moreThe production comes alive in the second half, the set and lighting creating magic even if the play attempts to abjure Prospero’s (and Shakespeare’s) studied alchemy. And there are so many interesting ideas at play. It is a shame that there is something medicinal about them: the idea that this is Good for us. The drama feels unsatisfactory when it is entirely sacrificed for the high concept, and possibly bamboozling for someone encountering it for the first time.Antonia (Prospero’s usurping sister, played by Amanda Hadingue) is a high-achieving conservative type who leaves in a huff, mid-scene. “I know this story and I don’t recognise it at all … I shall be writing to the Telegraph,” she says, in one of the funniest moments. It foils the naysayers, and is damning too, especially for this Guardian reader, who feels her own sense of frustration.AtSam Wanamaker Playhouse, London, until 12 AprilExplore more on these topicsTheatreShakespeare's GlobeTim CrouchThe TempestreviewsShareReuse this content"

Since starting Powerplant as a bedroom recording project in 2017, a couple of years after he left Ukraine to study in London, he has released records built around fizzing electro-punk,dungeon synthand treble-heavy hardcore, concocting Dungeons & Dragons-inspired role-playing adventures to accompany some of them, while slinging visually arresting DIY merch through hisArcane Dynamicslabel. Yet even coming amid an output this freewheeling, his upcoming new record is full of surprises.Bridge of Sacrifice is a pivot into black metal, with Zhykharyev’s antic synth melodies and slashing garage-rock guitars now accompanied by eerie screams and drum-machine blastbeats tinny enough to evoke the frost-bitten demos that emerged from Norway in the early 90s. It’s a head-spinning mix carried off with the gleeful energy of a fan indulging their passions – in thevideo for the title track, a trenchcoat-sporting Zhykharyev plays a Flying V in a creepy cellar, while Hall of Wolves’ squalling riff sounds comically evil – until the song breaks into a wonderfully camp, Cramps-worthy chorus.In these perma-anxious times, when hope is pretty much limited to placing one’s faith in the least-worst outcome, Zhykharyev’s desire to prioritise fun, earnestness and escapism in his fabulously odd music feels like sweet relief. He knows the stakes better than many –Beautiful Boy, a ripping punk song from 2023’s Grass EP, lamented everything that’s been lost since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

It was a seriously exciting debut. The year after, Treviño pulled off a similar coup in Zurich, establishing a career that has since caught fire across Europe. It has taken nearly a decade, but Treviño – this week announced as thenew principal conductorof Bucharest’s George Enescu Philharmonic – is finally back with the LSO. It was worth the wait.Treviño isn’t a flamboyant figure on the podium; his beat is tidy, his gestures deceptively contained. But there’s a coiled-spring muscularity and authority to his delivery that translated across the repertoire in this bizarrely programmed sequence. Rachmaninoff’s Symphony No 2 was the crowd-pulling second half, but before that a magnificent 20th-century oddity and something even odder from the 21st.Lost during the second world war, Messiaen’s 1932 Hymne was later “reconstructed” from memory by the composer. How accurately? No one knows. A Eucharist-ritual in sound, it’s a mystical, immanent affair, but Treviño ensured we never lost sight of the structural cathedral pillars through the clouds of incense billowing from the LSO strings and the woodwind’s distant organ.Márton Illés’s 2019 Vont-tér is less a violin concerto than its antithesis. Composed for maverick soloistPatricia Kopatchinskaja– appearing here in the second of three Artist Portrait performances – it strips the form of virtuosity and lyricism, turning expectations inside-out in its single continuous movement. Kopatchinskaja sold it hard, fiercely precise and playful, leading a chamber-sized LSO in a haunted textural dance of shudders, creaks and cracks (I missed the cameo for polystyrene plates). But what did it have to say to Messiaen or Rachmaninoff, beyond raising two musical fingers?Tempering the monumentality of the second symphony with plenty of pace and vertical translucency, Treviño gave us cinematic Rachmaninoff: melodies always on the move, always glancing forwards or harking back in this integrated web of a work. It’s a piece that can get top-heavy, but here we set off with the eruptive finale already in our sights, galloping to a close, brass with Valhalla in their sights.Explore more on these topicsClassical musicreviewsShareReuse this content"

Campiche plucked guitar, zither and east Asian-style sounds from the harp, mingled with vocal loops, classical music, Nordic ambient jazz and more. You might call her soundscape magical or otherworldly if it didn’t coexist with a campaigner’s political urgency on environmental and social issues. But Campiche is too much of a visionary to overwhelm the eloquence of pure sound with polemic, as her new album, the unaccompanied Unspoken, confirms more than ever.View image in fullscreenThe artwork for Unspoken by Julie CampicheCampiche’s extra-musical agenda here is a celebration of sisterhood, dedicated to women in public and private lives who have inspired her. The opening Anonymous is built around a Virginia Woolf quote – “for most of history, ‘anonymous’ was a woman” – repeated by a chorus of women’s voices in different languages building to a clamour. Grisélidis Réal is named after the Swiss artist and writer who took her physical and mental life to every precipice, including sex work, expressed in gently lyrical harp lines around the spooky sounds of footsteps clicking on pavements.Rosa is a lilting harp melody dedicated to the weary resolve of migrant workers, the rhythm-shifting Andréa Bescond a lissome tribute to the French actor and director and on Maman du Ciel, Campiche mesmerisingly uses her in- and out-breaths as the rhythm pattern. Unspoken is the least jazzy of the remarkable Campiche’s ventures so far, but if she didn’t inhabit a world of improvisers, she could never have imagined it like this.Also out this monthNew York avant-jazz pianistCraig Tabornsurfaced in the late 90s with leaders including Tim Berne and Steve Coleman, but his own work has blossomed in the 21st century. With Dream Archives (ECM), in a trio with cello star Tomeka Reid and percussionist/composer Ches Smith, he embraces fast-moving collective free-swing, smouldering lyrical originals and two heartfelt tributes (Paul Motian’s Mumbo Jumbo and Geri Allen’s When Kabuya Dances). The trumpeterAirelle Besson, a luminary of French jazz, further nurtures her long relationship with accordionistLionelSuárezon Blossom (Bretelles Prod/Papillon Jaune), a mainstream but delightful mix of jaunty and tender originals, and affectionate covers of Carla Bley’s Ida Lupino and the Pat Metheny/Lyle Mays song Au Lait. And gifted young UK pianist/composerNoah Stonemancontinues his steady rise with Dance at Zero, ingenious transformations of his minuscule compositions into rich improvisations in the company of fast-rising young saxophonist Emma Rawicz, bassist Freddie Jensen and UK jazz drum maestro James Maddren.Explore more on these topicsJazzJazz album of the monthalbum reviewsShareReuse this content"

After a decade together, the New Zealand four-piece have honed an airy, lush, lightly melancholic sound – but now they want change. “More extreme everything, more boldness,” guitarist Charlie Ryder has said of fifth record No Love Lost to Kindness, written during the band’s “most friction-filled creative period” to date. While it’s true that their latest singles are faster, louder and more distorted, these bright, pretty tracks will rattle only their longest-serving fans.View image in fullscreenBashville on the Sugar locks eyes with an ex on the subway and rushes with Olivia Campion’s breathless drumming, while Blister flips the band’s knack for whistleable melodies into pogoing, enjoyably predictable pop punk that professes “venom and rage” but is far more fun than furious. Drag begins as a genuine switch-up, with threatening bass and an uncharacteristically deadpan performance from singer Christie Simpson as she picks apart an ADHD diagnosis, but soon blossoms into billowy, even dreamy, layered vocals and luminous guitar.This voyage of self-discovery is more intriguing on the quiet, disoriented 95 – a song about ambition and homesickness with delicate atmospherics and a surprisingly folky touch – and closer Waiting for the Cards to Fall, which mourns a relationship run dry but not yet over. Without the usual reverb, Simpson’s vocals are striking: “I’m leaving you no matter what, turning myself into dust,” she vows, gothic and ghostly. Far from a dramatic reinvention, this is Yumi Zouma remaking themselves in real time. Change is often slower than we’d like it to be.Explore more on these topicsMusicIndiealbum reviewsShareReuse this content"

Conductor Mark Wigglesworth keeps up the momentumFlora WillsonFri 30 Jan 2026 10.30 ESTLast modified on Fri 30 Jan 2026 13.05 ESTShareA figure with the head of a doll plays with a multicoloured spinning top, high above the stage. Three men – hooded and armed – creep forwards and seize him, slashing his throat and dragging him off.It’s a brutal start to a brutal opera. This flashback is the brainchild of directorRichard Jones(in his2016 Royal Opera production, revived for the second time by Ben Mills, we see it replayed twice more as an episode that haunts the protagonist), but the overriding atmosphere is Mussorgsky’s. Based on Pushkin’s drama about a tsar’s reign, Boris Godunov is among the darkest of all operas. In the composer’s lean, mean original version, it is almost relentlessly so: dominated by low voices, its orchestration dense and heavy, the seven scenes push inexorably towards crisis.In this context, pacing is everything. ConductorMark Wigglesworthkept up the momentum, maximising the contrast between the score’s muddiest, most overblown passages, where monumental slabs of lower brass were almost obliterated by the tolling of bells, and the light cast periodically by finely blended high woodwind. When not inaudible – did those tintinnabulations need to be quite so catastrophic? – the strings were vital to this musical chiaroscuro, by turns fidgety and tender, roughly hewn and spun into a single, delicate thread.View image in fullscreenAmong the darkest of all operas… Boris Godunov at the Royal Opera House.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianIn Jones’s production, the drama plays out in a single, beautifully lit set: a cavernous charcoal-grey box with a small, bright yellow, low-ceilinged chamber above. The chorus is clad in regulation peasant-drab until ordered to dress brightly for Boris’s coronation. The Boyars sport matching jaw-length 1970s bobs and everyone onstage is slightly grubby – except the hostess (a cameo played here bySusan Bickleyin a stroke of deluxe casting) who is a one-woman colour pop. There’s an opening burst of movement as the chorus dashes around frantically and the painful physical progress ofAdam Palka’s elderly monk Pimen, whose “chronicle” becomes a vast panel of paintings he drags across the stage to stress the nature of his burden. The light-relief “monks” in the tavern scene bob around cartoonishly.Mostly, however, this is a production that frames the singing as the main event. Among an impressive cast, Palka andAndrii Kymach(as the Boyar’s clerk Andrei Shchelkalov) stood out as especially compelling, while Robert Berry-Roe was exceptionally assured in the treble role of Boris’s son. In promising house debuts,Alexander Roslavetswas an ideally thuggish Varlaam andJamez McCorklesumptuously treacle-voiced as Grigory Otrepiev. Best of all wasBryn Terfelin the title role he has taken in this production since its debut. His tsar is unmistakeably troubled: wild-eyed, with violent consonants, grim giggles and lurches into barking. But Terfel’s voice also remains supple and rich, its beauty insisting on this complex character’s ultimate humanity.Until 18 February.Explore more on these topicsOperaClassical musicreviewsShareReuse this content"

In their new disc they explore three composers who embody the musical cutting-edge that might have been encountered in the Austrian capital either side of the Great War.View image in fullscreenThe artwork for Out of Vienna.Photograph: AlphaAlban Berg and Anton Webern took Schoenberg’s theories of free atonality and the 12-tone system in rather different directions. Berg’s Lyric Suite was a fervent outpouring to his mistress, and the quartet aptly captures the moody sensuality of this intense, intricate music. The Andante Amoroso swoons; the Allegro Misterioso tiptoes on muted strings; the Presto Delirando is positively coital. The playing is unflinching and seethes with imaginative detail.A memorial to his mother, Webern’s Five Pieces from 1909 were effectively the first atonal string quartet. The composer’s dynamic variety and breadth of imagination are astonishing, as is the maturity and expressivity of the interpretation here. From just four years earlier, the Langsamer Satz is the most overtly romantic thing Webern ever wrote: a musical case of the road not taken.Spliced between them as a palate cleanser is Erwin Schulhoff’s Five Pieces, a quirky suite that runs the gamut, from a slyly sent up Viennese waltz to a louche Argentine tango. The Czech-born composer embraced many musical styles throughout his career, but here seems to be thoroughly enjoying his absurdist phase. Again, the playing and recorded sound are top-tier.Explore more on these topicsClassical musicalbum reviewsShareReuse this content"

Could I finally best her?Fri 30 Jan 2026 05.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 30 Jan 2026 11.45 ESTShareMy mother bore me. My mother nurtured me. My mother educated me. She has a resilience unmatched, a love all-forgiving. She is the glue that holds our family together. But right now, I am kicking herassat video game bowling, and it feelsgood!In the 00s, my mum was the best Wii Bowling player in the world. She was unbeatable. Strike after strike after strike. The Dudette in our family’s Big Lebowski. So when she said she was coming to visit us in Canada, I thought the time was right to buy the updatedNintendo SwitchSports version of her favourite game. She’s 76 now, and I might finally have a chance of beating her, I thought, especially if I allowed myself a cheeky tune-up on the game before she arrived.I fire up Nintendo Switch Sports to get the lay of the land. Tennis and golf have survived the almost 20 years since Wii Sports, along with bowling. The tennis has nothing to keep me entertained for longer than 10 minutes, and I have been terrified of any golf game where you swing a controller since Christmas morning 2009, when my wife surprised me with Tiger Woods PGA Tour Golf for the Wii and I surprisedherby throwing my back out after a six-hour session on it.View image in fullscreenDominik Diamond (right) and his family play Wii Bowling in 2006 with great intensity.Photograph: Dominik DiamondVolleyball and badminton are a double serving of meh. Little kids might find them fun, but not this big one. Basketball has been carried over from Wii Sports Resort, and Chambara is an updated version of fencing. The latter is every bit as chaotic as the original, the former is still a car crash: the hand motion that you have to use to move and dribble is one that I haven’t vigorously practised since I was a teenager. And I don’t want to do it in front of my mother.If basketball is a fender-bender, then the new football game is a multi-car pileup. It’s a slower, less entertaining version ofRocket League, but one that allows you to strap a controller to your leg to virtually kick the ball. There is no way a 56-year-old man should try to kick something that doesn’t exist. You may as well take a pair of scissors to your hamstrings.However, just like Wii Sports before it, Switch Sports is worth every penny because of the bowling.It is the very essence of gaming fun and simplicity, which is great because we were all drunk when we had our first session. Three generations of Diamond family silliness. It was beautiful.Mum wasn’t without criticisms of the new version. The updated Mii characters are too realistic; she preferred the quasi-abstract shape of the Wii originals. And she is deflated that the Switch just says “spare” rather than “NICE SPARE!”Her biggest criticism is the size of the Joy-Con controllers compared with the Wii remote.“I am happier with something bigger in my hands,” she cackles.She is incorrigible. I know where I get it from.The next day it was just my mum and I, playing sober. It was a very different kind of gaming, social and laid-back; we talked about how she fell in love with this game during a Christmas at my house back in 2006. My brother was there, with his kids, and my sister-in-law was visiting from Canada. I have zero recollection of this, so thank goodness I have an elderly mother to help me remember things in my dotage.‘I wouldn’t have the life I have had without her’ … Dominik Diamond plays on his mum’s ZX Spectrum.Photograph: Dominik DiamondShe loved it so much that when she returned home, she immediately bought her own Wii. It lives and breathes to this day, with all the plastic adornments you got with Wii Sports – the one and only game she has ever played on it.Introducing her to her favourite game feels like a repayment, because my mum was the one who got me into gaming. She had gone back to school to train as a word processing teacher in the 80s and had an interest in programming, so she bought a ZX Spectrum to learn BASIC – but she never had a chance, as us kids hijacked the machine to go Manic Mining. Yup. Our Atic Atac addiction stopped our mum from essentially becoming Brenda Romero.Mum claims she introduced me to the “game” that changed my life. Mavis Beacon Teaches Typing. She has a point. I type crazy fast, because of Mavis. We reminisce about the last-minute calls to her theatre school when we were short of audience members for GamesMaster, and the joy she felt when I got athletes to wave hello to her on the telly.I wouldn’t have the life I have had without her.I hope that my kids get me over for a games night when I am 76, so they can finally best me at Street Fighter II, when my arthritic thumbs can no longer pull off a Dragon Punch. And then I hope that their kids do that with them, and this glorious circle of gaming life continues.I am so happy to have this time with her to play games again. But I’m even happier for the space we fillaroundthe game, the memories we continue to create. A week after she left, I booted up bowling again, but I only played for 10 minutes before I switched it off. It just wasn’t the same without Mum.Explore more on these topicsGamesNintendo SwitchFamilycommentShareReuse this content"

Last is صباح عمر سعد المصري, or Sabah Omar Saad al-Masri, an eight-year-old girl.These names of two children mark the beginning and end of the Wall of Tears, a massive art installation paying homage to the 18,457 children killed inGazabetween 7 October 2023 and 19 July 2025. Created by artistPhil Buehler, it opened next to Pine Box Rock Shop bar at 12 Grattan Street in Brooklyn, New York, on Thursday.Made of waterproof and UV-coated vinyl, the 50ft long, 10ft tall sand-coloured mural lists the children killed in Gaza by the order in which they died, based on data from the Gaza health ministry. This will be punctuated by photos and stories of individual children, drawing on reports bythe Guardianand Washington Post newspapers.‘It felt like she was asking me to save her’: the film based on a five-year-old Palestinian girl’s dying pleasRead more“If you approach from a distance, it looks like almost an abstract painting and that draws people in to see, what is that?” Buehler, 69, says by phone. “Then you’ll see they’re names of the children killed inGazasince 7 October and there are thousands of them stretching down the block.“Then you’ll be drawn in further, I hope, to see the faces, read the stories of some of the few dozen I’ve scattered throughout the fence. That’s the part that gets me when I look at it. You see these faces full of joy and hope, snapshots from graduations and birthday parties and family gatherings and knowing that these kids’ lives were just cut short.”The artist reflects: “You can’t not think about your own kids and your own families. I hope that might lead people to think about how they might help, even if it’s just, take a photo of the mural and pass it along on their social media to their friends and family because hearing something from someone you know is important.”Buehler has previously designed huge murals including Wall of Lies, displaying more than 20,000 lies told by Donald Trump during his first term as president; theWall of Liars and Deniers, listing 381 Republican election deniers running in the 2022 midterms; theWall of Shame, chronicling the actions of more than 1,500 January 6 rioters; andEmpty Beds, highlighting the abduction of nearly 20,000 Ukrainian children by Russia.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Phil BuehlerHe worked on the Wall of Tears with his regular collaborator, the non-profitRadio Free Brooklyn. The project is necessarily out of date before it opens: it only records deaths up until last July because that was the most recent update to the Gaza health authorities’ database; hundreds more children have been killed since then, even after an October ceasefire.“This is probably one of the hardest ones I’ve worked on emotionally,” Buehler says. “I always think of this quote attributed to Stalin, that a single death is a tragedy, a million deaths is a statistic. People can relate to one person’s suffering but then they tune out or get overwhelmed by thousands and the destruction and death in Gaza is one of those stories.“I hope with this piece, the Wall of Tears, you can both understand the scale of these 18,457 children’s deaths by seeing their names stretching down the street 50 ft and empathise with their surviving families.”Despite harsh weather, Buehler opened the installation on Thursday to coincide with the second anniversary of the death of Hind Rajab, a five-year-old left to bleed out among the bodies of six family members after their car was targeted by an Israeli tank, leaving it with 335 bullet holes, according to theForensic Architecture research group.The Palestine Red Crescent Society released audio recordings of Hind’s final hours, documenting repeated, urgent requests for rescue and call handlers, increasingly distressed themselves, assuring her that help was on the way. This real-life audio can be heard in theThe Voice of Hind Rajab, a Tunisian film by the director Kaouther Ben Hania that has been nominated for an Oscar in the international feature category.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Phil BuehlerBuehler says: “The film is incredibly gut-wrenching and it does deserve an Academy award because it’s a re-enactment of the call, where the Red Crescent are taking the call, but the voice is hers.She’s on the phone. She’s five and she’s pleading, come get me. This innocent five-year-old kid has become the image of the tragedy there.”The war in Gaza has been a divisive issue in New York, which with nearly 1 million Jews has the biggest Jewish population outside Israel. Efforts to brand Zohran Mamdani, a champion of Palestinian rights,as antisemitic, fell flat as he won election to become New York’s first Muslim mayor.Buehler rejects the notion that opposition to the war equates to antisemitism. “Conflating those two things makes it more difficult to talk about,” he says. “You can’t have that conversation at all. I worry a little bit about that with this piece.“I talked to a lot of both Palestinian and Jewish friends. Most of my Jewish friends are liberal Jews and their reaction was, it’s a tragedy, their heart goes out for these kids and these families, but they are afraid bringing attention to it will bounce back as antisemitism.“So Jews are afraid of bringing attention to it and Palestinians are afraid of bringing attention to it because it bounces back against them. This moment in time in our culture and our world is not one for open dialogue. It’s so split, so tribal. ‘If you are against killing the kids in Gaza then you must be against Jews.’ That’s not true.”Explore more on these topicsArtGazaPalestineIsraelIsrael-Gaza warfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Torquato Tasso’s Jerusalem Delivered is a pseudo-medieval epic of chivalry and adventure with a strong religious theme as it portrays Christian knights battling Muslim enemies in the First Crusade. So far so simple, but this painting depicts Erminia, a Muslim woman who in Tasso’s poem falls in love with the Christian Tancred. She also puts on male armour as she searches for him. This painter at the end of the classically obsessed Renaissance depicts her in ancient Roman-styled armour, instead of the chain mail Crusaders wore. She has taken off her plumed helmet to show her long hair and reveal that she is a woman. The shepherd offers her shelter. It looks like the landscape outside Rome with the Tiber flowing through it, in this moment of peace from an epic of war.National Gallery, LondonSign up to the Art Weekly newsletterIf you don’t already receive our regular roundup of art and design news via email,please sign up here.Get intouchIf you have any questions or comments about any of our newsletters please emailnewsletters@theguardian.comExplore more on these topicsArt and designArt Weekly newsletterPaintingPhotographyArtExhibitionsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I always have an odd end of marzipan after the festive season, and this is a great way to use it up and bring that cosy almond flavour. The marzipan gets blitzed into the butter for a plush-textured loaf cake, and comes together in minutes thanks to simply putting everything in a food processor.Citrus and almond cakePrep10 minCook1 hr 10 min, plus coolingServes8-10200gunsalted butter, softened125g marzipan150gcaster sugarFinely grated zest and juice of 1 orange, plus 2 tbsp extra juice for the icingFinely grated zest and juice of 1 lemon3 large eggs220gplain flour50gground almonds¼ tsp fine sea salt2 tspbaking powder50gplain yoghurtTo finish100gicing sugar40g toasted flaked almondsHeat the oven to 180C (160C fan)/350F/gas 4, and grease and line a 2lb loaf tin with baking paper.Put the butter and marzipan in a food processor and blitz until smooth. Add the sugar and orange and lemon zest, give the mix a quick pulse, then add the eggs and pulse again. Tip in the dry ingredients and pulse just until you have a smooth batter, then mix in the orange juice, reserving two tablespoons to make the icing, and the yoghurt until combined.Pour the batter into the lined tin and bake for 45-55 minutes, until a skewer inserted into the middle comes out clean. Leave to cool in the tin for 10 minutes.To make the icing, mix two tablespoons of orange juice with two tablespoons of lemon juice in a small bowl. Put the icing sugar in a second bowl and add the citrus juice a tablespoon at a time, until the icing has a slightly thick but pourable consistency.Remove the cake from its tin, then pour over the icing. Top with the toasted flaked almonds and leave to set before slicing and serving.Explore more on these topicsCakeThe sweet spotFoodFruitNuts and seedsBakingWinter food and drinkDessertrecipesShareReuse this content"
