The experience was fun – but also led to horrendous online abuse. Now she’s back, playing a tough and surprising matriarch in the Regency smash hitWed 7 Jan 2026 05.00 ESTShareSome actors might have been a little put out to audition for the role of the beautiful young romantic lead, and instead be cast as her mother, but not Katie Leung. “Absolutely not,” she says with a laugh. “I look young for my age – as most people in the west think Asians do – but I felt really seen to finally get to play the role of a mother.” She is a mother, she points out, and anyway, the role of Lady Araminta Gun, the steely aristo who is about to rock the new series of Netflix’s Regency behemothBridgerton, is so delicious, who could be insulted?Araminta, widowed, has seen off two husbands, and now she’s trying to marry off her two teenage daughters, ideally to a Bridgerton, while keeping her stepdaughter, Sophie, in her place – as a Cinderella-style servant for the family. “The showrunners reassured me that it wasn’t going to be the archetypal evil stepmother role,” says Leung. “They wanted to find the humanity in Araminta. They wanted to ensure I knew her background, her struggles, why she makes these decisions, and why she’s so formidable.”View image in fullscreenKatie as Lady Araminta Gun in Bridgerton.Photograph: Liam Daniel/NetflixShe is, though, from the four episodes I’ve seen, pretty evil to Sophie. Leung agrees. “The thing about her, and with so many of the characters in Bridgerton, is they do these awful things, they make mistakes, they’re human. When you see the final episode, you might think differently, and that’s wonderful, because normally you don’t get to do that with these ‘evil’ characters. Her drive comes from love and protection for her daughters. I get it, having become a mum,” she says – her son has recently turned three. “You will do anything for your kids. I don’t think I would have felt that way before.”What is it like to join a show as big as Bridgerton? “I feel really blessed, genuinely,” she says. She is used to huge productions – her first role was Cho Chang in the Harry Potter films. “It feels quite familiar, in a sense. Also I’m older, and at a place in my life where I’m not too fazed going into something seemingly so huge.” The Harry Potter films coincided with the rise of social media and extreme online fandom – something the stars of Bridgerton have also had to deal with, much of itintense, appalling and racist.If Leung is concerned, she doesn’t show it. She went through it withHarry Potter, and to some extent with Arcane, the animated Netflix show based on the League of Legends video game universe, in which she voices a character. Leung says she has learned to have a healthy distance from the noise surrounding her job. “I still care about the craft [of acting], I still want to do well, but I can park it once I’m done for the day and go home and live this other life. It’s more like a job for me than the be-all and end-all, which is how I felt about acting when I was in my 20s.”View image in fullscreenKatie (second left) in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire.Photograph: TCD/Prod.DB/AlamyLeung seems grounded and thoughtful. She has campaigned to raise awareness of sexual violence against women, and on Instagram she is as likely to post about the horrors in Gaza as her own work. We talk about the rise of the far right, and watching anti-immigrant rhetoric spread throughout the UK. It’s frightening, she says: “I feel as if I’ve experienced it, in the supermarket, in day-to-day life. I’m very aware that I live in a bubble in London, because if there’s anywhere that’s diverse, it’s London.” In her area, especially, she says, “there’s a real sense of community and inclusion and all these things, and even then, I’m experiencing it. I’m concerned. And it’s not just Britain, it’s all over the world.”Leung grew up moving between various towns in Scotland, because of her father’s job running a wholesale business. She became an actor by accident. She didn’t even do plays at school, except one production of the musical Bugsy Malone, and even then she appeared as a dancer. Her father spotted an open audition for Harry Potter and suggested it to Leung. She was less interested in landing the role than in getting her divorced parents in the same room for the first time in years – as her mother would accompany them to the audition.“My mum and dad hadn’t seen each other for a long time, but I was really excited, because I guess in my 16-year-old mind there was still a possibility that they might get back together.” She smiles. When she took part in the audition in London, the first three Harry Potter films had already been huge, and it felt like there were thousands of people queueing outside, she says. She thought she had no chance of getting it.View image in fullscreenAs an unauthorised migrant, Ying, in Channel 4’s Run.Photograph: Des Willie/Channel 4Leung’s parents split up when she was three, and her mother, who worked in finance, went to live in Hong Kong. Leung and her brother were raised by their father (he remarried, and she also has younger siblings). “To be honest, it was my grandmother who really raised me. My dad was working full-time.” It must have been hard, and fairly unusual, to grow up without her mother around. “Yeah,” says Leung, carefully. “It’s such a huge part of my identity, it’s not something I can ignore and say it didn’t have a huge impact on my life. But because I’m really happy with where I am and who I am, [although there is] obviously still lots of work to be done, I wouldn’t have it any other way.” Leung and her mother were in touch throughout her childhood, and have a good relationship now, she says.How did she deal with the extreme and sudden fame that came with Harry Potter? “I don’t think I did,” she says. “It was overwhelming from the get-go. Being in the spotlight from that age, when you’re already insecure, was difficult, to say the least.” She’s more aware of it now, she says, looking back. “At the time, I was having a lot of fun. I thought: this is different from school, and I really did not enjoy school. So it was a way to escape. I’m still trying to figure it out, really, how it affected me.”The young actors were looked after, she says, even if conversations about mental health, and particularly the impact on young stars, weren’t as advanced as they are today. “I don’t know if anything could have been done back then to make things better or easier,” she says. “At that age, you’re curious. I remember being very curious about what people were saying about me, and I was Googling myself. Nobody could have stopped me, because I was old enough to make up my own mind.”What she found online was horrendous racism and hurtful personal comments. How did she cope with that? “I didn’t. I think it just sat with me, and it affected me in ways like, ‘Oh yeah, I made that decision because people were saying this about me.’ It probably made me less outgoing. I was very self-aware of what was coming out of my mouth.” It didn’t help, she says, that being catapulted into this successful career meant she felt she hadn’t earned it. “It happened by pure chance,” she says, underplaying her talent, as if it had been a lottery. “And for the longest time, I may have tried to make up for it, and overcompensate.”I was really hard on myself. I was trying to constantly prove I was more than just the actor from Harry PotterLeung was in the last five films of the series. “I remember coming out of it and thinking, ‘Nothing’s going to beat it,’ because it was so successful. I remember being lost, going, ‘What’s next? People will have these high expectations of me topping it, and it’s never going to happen.’ I think I was so afraid of meeting these expectations that I gave up, or didn’t give myself the chance, after it, to try and continue acting.” She started a degree in photography, but towards the end of her studies, got a part in a play. On stage, she remembers thinking, “No, actually, this is what I want to do.”She went on to study drama at the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland. Did she feel conscious that she was the actor from Harry Potter? “Oh my God, yes, absolutely. I tried really hard not to mention it, even when we were doing introductions at the beginning of the year, even though everybody knew. I didn’t want people to think that was the reason I got in. Not that it was, but I was really hard on myself. I was trying to constantly prove I was more than just the actor from Harry Potter.” (The films, she stresses, are “such a huge part of where I came from, and I’m grateful for it, and it still resonates with a lot of people”.)View image in fullscreenAs the formidable Lady Araminta Gao, with (left) Isabella Wei as Posy Li and Michelle Mao as Rosamund Li, in Bridgerton.Photograph: Liam Daniel/NetflixFor a long time after drama school, Leung was mainly considered for roles that were “these kind of epic tales of the east, whether that be North Korea or China. Deep, dark subject matters.” In the BBC drama One Child, she played the child of a Chinese mother, adopted by a British-American couple; and in Channel 4’s Run, an unauthorised migrant. She enjoyed these roles, she says, “and it gave me the chance to be more knowledgable about the world, and the injustices that happen around us all the time”. But it also felt limiting. “It’s one of these things where just because there weren’t many roles out there, I was incredibly grateful to be considered. A large part of that was me, again, giving myself a hard time, thinking I wasn’t deserving of anything.”She remembers the end of school, and the yearbook in which people had written who they thought their fellow students would become; Leung was described as the next Lucy Liu, the Hollywood actor. “Obviously I’m a huge fan of Lucy Liu, she’s had great longevity in her career, but that irked me. I remember thinking, why not Meryl Streep? I was kind of restricted by my race, and I guess Lucy Liu was the only other Asian actor that was, at the time, on the big screen.”What would it have meant to Leung to see a lead – in Bridgerton, Yerin Ha plays her stepdaughter, Sophie, whose storyline, and potential romance with Benedict Bridgerton, powers the fourth season – who looked like her, in one of the biggest shows in the world, when she was growing up? “I’m envious of the younger generation who are getting to see people that represent them on screens now,” she says. “I know it would have done me good.”When she works with younger actors such as Ha, does she get a sense that their experience has been different from hers? “We’re still a long way away from where we need to be. It’s better, but it’s not as good as it needs to be. I really admire the younger generation because they are more self-aware and they express themselves in a way that I, once upon a time, did not. Even now, I’m working on myself, to say what I need, whether it’s in a relationship or at the workplace, with my mum or my partner. It’s really fundamental to having any good relationship with anybody.”View image in fullscreenHaving a moment with Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) in Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix.Photograph: Digital Fusion Image Library/Globe Photos/ZUMA Press Wire/ShutterstockLeung thinks the quirky BBC crime drama Annika might have been the first time she was cast in a role where her ethnicity wasn’t relevant (though her Scottishness was, playing a detective with Glasgow’s Marine Homicide Unit). Progress has been slow, but it is happening, she says. “We’re getting there, and especially with a role like Araminta in Bridgerton, being able to play a mother who has daughters – this kind of family dynamic is something I feel is always lacking. That’s where we need to try and get to now.” As opposed, she says, to the smaller, incidental roles – a journalist, say, or a social worker – “who has no ties to the rest of the cast. Because it is all about relationships.”Bridgerton’s famously diverse cast has changed the landscape for period drama. “Their inclusion and diversity behind and in front of the camera is just …” Leung smiles. “You can see it and feel it, and that made me feel really safe to be able to kind of play as an actor.” Still, disappointingly, but not unsurprisingly, Bridgerton’s “colour-conscious” casting has been criticised. Will we ever get to the point when a show can do this, and not be? “The more we can have it, the less of a thing it becomes. But for now, we’re kind of in the middle of it,” says Leung. But it goes to show that it works. “The reason it’s successful is because the writing is great, the directing is great, the acting, the relationships between the characters.”Next, Leung is about to film another role in Scotland, which she can’t say much about, except it’s an interesting role with a “kind of flexibility for me to play with it, so I’m really excited”. She has reached a point, she says, where she no longer questions whether she deserves her career. “I know who I am. I know what I can do.”Explore more on these topicsDramaBridgertonHarry PotterRacefeaturesShareReuse this content"

His victory in Clacton in 2024 followed seven unsuccessful attempts in other constituencies. And now he is finally an MP, he seems reluctant to spend any time in the Commons chamber. The one place where we, the public, now pay him to be.It’s as if the reality of his new position is a disappointment. A reality check. His entire career had been a narcissistic celebration of self and it feels as though he had expected the rules of engagement to be changed to accommodate his need for constant attention. He had come to parliament to make himself heard, not to sit and wait his turn as the leader of a party with just five MPs.Rather than shrugging his shoulders and getting on with life, Nige has taken to hissy fits. Demanding he should be treated with the respect he feels he deserves. So he regularly chooses to sit in the gallery during prime minister’s questions rather than his allotted place on the opposition benches. For the first Wednesday of the new year, Farage went one better. He skipped the session entirely, choosing instead to do a slot commenting onPMQson Times Radio. What better way to make the session all about him?First, though, Nige had grabbed the media limelight by holding a marathon press conference – one hour and 40 minutes – in London. A presser that was not time sensitive and could easily have been held on a slower news day or on his usual Monday morning slot.But a narcissist has got to do what a narcissist has got to do and Nige was desperate to be back in front of the TV cameras for the first time this year. You could sense his relief as the withdrawal symptoms dissipated. This was his time. His place. His chance to shine. And he was going to enjoy every minute. He would also later say he would have two PMQs a week if he became prime minister. Please no. Enough is enough. Nige is yet to realise the world can have too much Nige. For him that is a category error.What Nige wanted to talk about most today was the London mayoral election in 2027. No one seemed to have informed him that the election is actually a year later, in 2028. London under Sadiq Khan had turned into the most dangerous city in the world, he said. People were literally too afraid to walk the streets. You could go outside and find no one. They were all cowering in their safe rooms at home. Waiting for Nige to give them the signal that it was OK to come out. At least three of the journalists who had been expecting to attend the press conference had been gunned down on their way over from Westminster.Having made the case for why no one should ever consider living or working in London, Nige went on to introduce Laila Cunningham, Reform’s prospective London mayoral candidate. It turned out thatshe too hated London. A city where foreigners were either raping women or stealing phones. But she was going to do us all a big favour and make it better for us. There were going to be police officers on every street, she was going to scrap the Ulez and congestion charges, sack all tube drivers and make us all rich by building new houses for a few hundred quid each. She sounded clueless. And she was going to pay for all this by making sure that the 500,000 close friends of Sadiq who had all been earning £150k a year for doing nothing were taken off London’s payroll. Somehow, Cunningham expected to be taken seriously.The questions went on even longer than the initial presentation. Some on London. Nige wasn’t at all pleased to hear that crime surveys had shown London was a great deal safer than most other large cities. Fake news, he insisted. Though he was at a loss to explain why so many people still wanted to live in the capital. It must be because most people have a death wish and go out each morning hoping they are going to be stabbed at some point.There again, Nige is prone to confusion. He seemed to think that were Donald Trump to seize Greenland it would be a demonstration of the US commitment to Nato. It’s a view, I suppose.But maybe we shouldn’t take too much notice of anything Nige says because his answers are ever changing. He has now decided he has navigated the discomfort of the 28 Dulwich schoolboys with clear memories of his racist and antisemitic behaviour. Asked to apologise,he refused. All 28 of them were clear fantasists, he said. People should just learn to lighten up a little. Nige did look rattled when asked about the £13k he had made from X. Given it’s a platform for AI porn, shouldn’t he return the money? What was the point of being a politician if you couldn’t earn a few quid on the side, he shrugged. Plus, think of all his overheads.Still, maybe Nige did have a point about staying away from the Commons, because the first PMQs of the year was something of a nonevent. With Venezuela, Greenland and Ukraine grabbing the early headlines, it was perhaps inevitable the session would be dominated by foreign affairs. It’s customary on these occasions for politicians on all sides of the house to show a united front. Something that shouldn’t have been too hard forKemi Badenochas the Tories are basically in agreement with the government on all things Nato.Only, there is no accounting for Kemi. The Tory leader has long been on a personal mission to pick a fight with absolutely anyone and she tried to take on Keir Starmer. She thought she was looking prime ministerial: in reality she looked unhinged and childish. Attacking the PM for not having had a phone call with Trump even though he had been negotiating with his top team. Blaming Labour for not having done more to stop the Tories from screwing up when they had been in power. Making a big deal about a Commons statement that would have been a sideshow at best.Their exchanges ended badly for Kemi. She didn’t seem to realise there was a huge difference between the cases the attorney general had done before he joined the government and the shadow attorney general advising a Russian oligarch while part of Kemi’s team. A Tory spokesperson later clarified that David Wolfson would nowrecuse himselfon all things Russian. Yup, the shadow attorney general silent on the most serious issue of our time. But maybe it will start a trend. Perhaps Honest Bob and The Philpster could be the next to back down. Here’s hoping.Explore more on these topicsNigel FarageThe politics sketchReform UKLaila CunninghamPMQsKemi BadenochcommentShareReuse this content"

Here are some of the options.Buy GreenlandThe US first floated the idea of making Copenhagen an offer for the Arctic island in 1867 after buying Alaska from Russia. It reconsidered the idea in 1910, and in 1917 it bought what are now the US Virgin Islands from Denmark for $25m (£18.5m).As the cold war got under way, the Truman administration made a formal offer in 1946 – only made public in 1991 – of $100m for the island, arguing it was “completely worthless to Denmark … and the control of Greenland is indispensable to the safety of the US”.10:03Is Greenland next for Donald Trump? | The LatestCopenhagen declined and since 2019, when Trump first expressed interest in the island, the Danish and Greenlandic governments have repeatedly said it is not for sale. Rubio, however, reportedly told members of Congress this week that the goal was to buy the territory.Legal and constitutional experts have noted that the era when countries could buy or barter others’ territories – and their people – is long gone. The international legal principle of self-determination makes an outright sale more or less impossible.Under their 2009 self-rule law, Greenlanders can hold a referendum on independence. It is up to the island’s 57,000 inhabitants to decide their future. Apoll in Januaryfound 85% did not want their homeland to become part of the US, with only 6% in favour.Woo GreenlandPolls, not always reliable on such small numbers, suggest Greenlanders’ feelings about Trump’s promises to invest billions of dollars in the territory are less clearcut, with the population almost evenly divided between seeing them as a threat and as an opportunity.The first step, already under way, is a hearts-and-minds campaign, investing in the island’s economic and educational development and intensifying diplomatic ties. The US consulate in Nuuk reopened in 2020 anda special envoyto Greenland was named last month.Denmark also suspects Washington of more covert tactics, includingan alleged influence campaign. Copenhagen believes this is intended to encourage the island’s growing independence movement, which is backed by a broad majority depending on the timescale.With an independence referendum won and approved by the Danish parliament, the dealmaking could begin. On a visit to Nuuk in March, the US vice-president, JD Vance, said he hoped independent Greenlanders would “choose to partner with the United States”.View image in fullscreenJD Vance on a visit to Greenland in March 2025.Photograph: Jim Watson/APGreenland’s current four-party coalition government has strongly asserted that the island belongs to its people.Naleraq, the opposition party that came second in last year’s election, is also in favour of independence but is more open to dialogue with the US.The party’s leader, Pele Broberg, has said he is not concerned by Trump’s recent threats and is confident the US would protect Greenland as an independent nation. “Besides, the US can’t do anything to us that Denmark hasn’t done already,” he said this week.Sign a ‘free association deal’Officials in Washington have reportedly been working for months on a possible “compact of free association” (Cofa) deal similar to the arrangement the US has with a number of small South Pacific nations, including the Marshall Islands.Under such a compact, the smaller country retains its independence and is guaranteed Washington’s protection and a potentially lucrative duty-free trade deal, while the US military gets to operate more or less without restriction in a strategically important territory.Many analysts see this as perhaps the most plausible longer-term outcome, with Greenland’s leaders – post-referendum – likely to see a Cofa or some other form of bilateral agreement as allowing them to combine independence with economic advantage.Rely on existing treatiesOne of the mysteries of the latest transatlantic tensions over Greenland is that the US already has wide military access and could easily have more. A 1951 US-Danish agreement allows it to “construct, install, maintain and operate” military bases across the territory.The treaty, which was updated in 2004 and includes Greenland’s semi-autonomous government, also allows the US to “house personnel … and control landings, takeoffs, anchorages, moorings, movements and operation of ships, aircraft and waterborne craft”.Copenhagen has repeatedly signalled its willingness to allow the US to significantly expand its military presence on Greenland, currently confined to the northern Pituffik space base, where about 500 personnel are reportedly stationed.View image in fullscreenThe Pituffik space base.Photograph: Ritzau Scanpix/ReutersAnother agreement, signed in December 2023 and in force since last year, gives the USunhindered accessto Danish airbases and allows it to carry out military activities in and from Denmark. The US has similar agreements with Sweden, Finland and Norway.InvadeIf all else fails, US analysts have suggested a military takeover would not in principle be difficult. Greenland has no territorial army, and the handful of ships and helicopters and lone plane operated by Denmark’s joint Arctic command in Nuuk are for observation purposes.Marco Rubio says he will meet Danish officials as Greenland crisis escalatesRead moreThey argue that a US military presence on the island, potentially with the support of a few special forces, would theoretically be enough to capture Nuuk in a matter of minutes, and could simply declare Greenland US territory.In practice, however, Danish analysts say it would be anything but straightforward – particularly in Greenland’s notoriously challenging weather conditions. And the fallout would be enormous.Denmark’s prime minister, Mette Frederiksen,said this weekthat a US attack on Greenland, which is covered by Denmark’s Nato membership, would mean the end of the military alliance.It would also explode “post-second world war security”, she said. Besides being entirely illegal, analysts also say a US military operation would instantly deprive Washington of its allies’ trust and potentially vital intelligence.Jacob Kaarsbo, a former analyst at the Danish defence intelligence agency, said a US attack would face opposition. A “quick and dirty job”, seizing the control tower and strategic sites, might have been possible in 2025, he said, but Denmark has ramped up its presence.Winter weather would also make any operation very difficult, he said. “I hope the Europeans can convince the US that we will indeed shoot back,” he said. “US soldiers would come back to the US in body bags.”Explore more on these topicsGreenlandTrump administrationUS foreign policyDenmarkNatonewsShareReuse this content"

But in recent days the windup radio – with its inbuilt torch and charge point – has come into its own during Germany’s longest power cut since the second world war.Leftwing anarchist militants haveclaimed responsibilityfor an arson attack on Saturday that cut the electricity to about 45,000 households, almost 2,000 businesses, four hospitals, 74 care homes, 20 schools and a considerable chunk of the public transport network in south-west Berlin.Federal state prosecutors have taken over the criminal investigation into the saboteurs, Vulkangruppe (Volcano Group), who said their aim was to “turn off the juice of those in power” and to highlight Germany’s overdependence on fossil fuels. Aside from some footprints left in the snow, investigators admit they have little to go on so far.View image in fullscreenAcross Berlin there has been an outpouring of goodwill towards those who lost power.Photograph: Clemens Bilan/EPAOn Wednesday morning the remaining 20,000 households and 850 businesses still without heating or hot water were finally reconnected. But many Germans still feel they are without answers to three vital questions: who was responsible, how could the infrastructure of Europe’s largest economy prove so vulnerable, and how can authorities prevent such an attack from happening again?“What is wrong with this city?” an anguished middle-aged man was heard asking on camera as Berlin’s mayor, Kai Wegner, dropped in on a sports hall housing residents on army camp beds. The man’s mother, who had been moved out of her nursing home, was lying on one of the beds.“How is it possible that the power grid is so insecure?” asked Anar, a cleaner in her 60s who was stuck on a train on the outskirts of Berlin on Saturday night, fearing she would be unable to get to her workplace – or be paid. “This has made a lot of people very angry.”View image in fullscreenAbout 45,000 households were affected by the blackout, which was caused by leftwing anarchist militants.Photograph: Ralf Hirschberger/AFP/Getty ImagesThe Red Cross, which came to the aid of thousands this week, has led urgent calls for more investment to be made in domestic civil protection and disaster relief.This week its members were among those handing out thermal flasks and muesli bars to residents. The army was brought in to distribute diesel to clinics running emergency generators and to help with repairs.When Berlin’s energy and economy senator, Franziska Giffey, turned up on Monday to see the fallout for herself, she could hardly hide her embarrassment. She said the attack was a “serious blow to critical infrastructure”, describing how the perpetrators had set fire to a bridge carrying high-voltage cables and had probably used public maps to select their location.“You can find a lot of information on the internet,” Giffey admitted in an interview with the broadcaster DLF, saying policymakers needed to prioritise security over transparency in future.View image in fullscreenThe city’s mayor, Kai Wegner, visited a sports hall housing residents on army camp beds.Photograph: Axel Schmidt/ReutersManuel Atug, a founder of AG Kritis, an independent working group of experts on critical infrastructure, said his organisation had repeatedly warned of shortfalls in the system, of a lack of planning to ensure that networks – be they electricity, water or cyber – were backed up so that they could not fail due to one event such as an arson attack. Glaring also is the failure of lawmakers to put pressure on utility companies and network operators.“Resilience costs money,” Atug said. “Companies only do what they’re legally required to do.” Politicians were keener to do things that were visibly striking, such as “building drone defence centres”, rather than implementing more mundane measures such as protecting energy networks or fixingdilapidated bridgesor school buildings, he told Der Spiegel.The far-right populist Alternative für Deutschland has been keen to exploit the situation, accusing the country’s leadership of failing to keep its citizens warm and safe, and turning out this week to give away blankets. In a statement, the party’s deputy federal spokesperson, Kay Gottschalk, said the government had failed to develop “any sort of consistent political and security-related response” to sabotage or arson attacks. “It’s no longer an abstract warning we face, but a bitter reality,” he said.View image in fullscreenCamp beds set up at an emergency dormitory in Zehlendorf town hall.Photograph: Lisi Niesner/ReutersAcross Berlin there has been an outpouring of goodwill towards those who lost power. Hotels and private individuals, as well as libraries, swimming pools, cinemas and museums, have opened their doors.Zehlendorf is known as a well-heeled part of Berlin, home to ambassadors, pop stars and business leaders, as well as ordinary Germans. Vulkangruppe apologised to people such as the Peters – a retired nurse and caretaker in their 70s – who have had to stay with friends for days. But Silke gave this short shrift, saying: “Tell that to the elderly who were stuck in their lifts when the black out happened, or our neighbour whose cat ran away and has yet to return.”The Peters hope to be able to return to their flat on Wednesday. When they do, Silke will be in on a secret her husband had kept.“It turns out he’d been doing his own prepping,” she said, referring to supplies of tinned fish and a large canister of drinking water he had put in the cellar, unbeknown to her. “Everyone in Germany is doing it these days. And why wouldn’t you? The difference to just a short while ago is that most readily admit it now without fear of ridicule.”Explore more on these topicsGermanyEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Its director explains why she had to tell Hind’s tragic storyJulian BorgerWed 7 Jan 2026 11.09 ESTLast modified on Wed 7 Jan 2026 12.08 ESTShareWhen Kaouther Ben Hania heard Hind Rajab’s voice for the first time, she was in Los Angeles airport scrolling through social media. The five-year-old’s cry for help cut through the clamour around her. This was in February 2024 and Hind had already been dead for at least a week, left to bleed out among the corpses of six of her relatives after their car was targeted by an Israeli tank, leaving it with 335 bullet holes, according to theForensic Architecture research group.More than 20,000 Palestinian children were killed in two years of Israeli bombardment of Gaza, according to UN estimates. Another 82 have been killed since 10 October when a ceasefire was declared and then routinely breached. The pictures of the dead have often been published online, including those of Hind, showing her dressed in pink with a floral tiara, or smiling in an oversized academic cap and gown, but her voice also remains to haunt the world after her death.It premiered at Venice, receiving a 23-minute standing ovation – the longest in the festival’s historyThePalestineRed Crescent Society (PRCS) posted audio recordings of her last hours, made by the organisation’s emergency call centre via a mobile phone in the car, as Hind repeatedly, desperately, appealed for someone to rescue her. On the same recording, we can hear the increasingly fraught workers at the centre promising her that help would soon be on the way.When Ben Hania heard Hind’s voice, it brought her to an abrupt halt in the airport terminal, as travellers milled around her. This was a young child calling on adults to protect her amid the appeal of Palestine to be saved from genocide – and on both counts, the world had failed. “When I heard her voice, for that millisecond, it felt as if she was asking me to save her,” she says. “There was something very immediate in her voice, and it was very shocking.”View image in fullscreenIncreasingly fraught ... actors playing the four  Palestine Red Crescent workers who deal with Hind’s call.Photograph: Ent-movie/AlamyThe Tunisian director was between stops on a US tour promoting her latest film, having already begun work on her next. But she immediately cleared her calendar so she could start a new film based around Hind’s voice. “It was in my head for days and days,” says Ben Hania. “I felt a very strong sense of sadness and helplessness. I was wondering, ‘What can I do?’ The only thing I know how to do is make movies.”The outline of the film began to take shape as Ben Hania researched the circumstances of the recording. She found out that the clips the PRCS had put online were just fragments. They had recorded the whole call, lasting three hours, and they sent it all to Ben Hania. Listening to all of it, knowing how it would end, was “one of the most difficult things I’ve heard in my life”, she says.There was one last thing to be done before starting work – calling Hind’s mother, Wissam Hamada, who was in mourning in Gaza. “I told her, ‘I want to do a movie. Tell me if you don’t want me to and I won’t do it. And she told me, ‘I don’t want my daughter to be forgotten. I want justice for my daughter. So if this movie can help, do it please.’ So it started.”The result, called simply The Voice of Hind Rajab, is a dramatic recreation of the tragedy as it unfurled in the narrow confines of the Red Crescent call centre, with actors playing the roles of the four emergency workers who were on the other end of the line – but Hind’s voice is her own. The actors respond to the real voice, trying to encourage and console Hind as the emergency workers had done, recreating the agony of their ultimate failure.Many films contain images that cannot be unseen. The Voice of Hind Rajab cannot be unheard. Ben Hania succeeded in the task that Hamada entrusted her with, to make her daughter unforgettable. As Ben Hania puts it: “To honour her voice and make it echo.” Hind’s insistent cries for someone, anyone, to “come to get me” can never now be silenced. They summon up the unfathomable cruelty of Israel’s campaign in Gaza, and the collective failure of the rest of the world to stop the killing.View image in fullscreenHollywood backers … director Kaouther Ben Hania, right, with Joaquin Phoenix and Rooney Mara.Photograph: Elisabetta A Villa/Getty ImagesBen Hania, who is speaking to me during a recent visit to London, has situated the film somewhere in the borderland between drama and documentary where she has made her career. Her film studies thesis at the Sorbonne University in Paris explored that frontier. Her first film, Challatt Tunes (The Blade of Tunis), was a mockumentary about sexism and violence against women in Tunisia, and her later works have ranged from dramas loosely based on true stories to an intimate documentary about a young Tunisian girl exiled in Canada. “The frontier between the genres is something like the frontier between countries,” she says. “When you are walking, you don’t realise when you’ve entered another country.”Ben Hania’s filmFour Daughters, which she was promoting in early 2024 when she heard Hind’s voice, is about a Tunisian mother called Olfa Hamrouni who has four girls, two of whom have embraced radical Islam and left to join Islamic State. The film plays with the conventions of documentary and drama, intertwining them, so that the real Hamrouni and her two remaining daughters meet the actors who portray them as well the missing girls. The real family comment throughout on their emotions as they watch their drama unfurled before them.“Since I’m drawn to real stories, I always ask myself what is the best form to tell the story,” the 48-year-old says. “Film-making is about making choices – where to tell the story, how to tell it, in which way, in which form. And to make those choices, I always try to stay faithful to the first moment I encountered the story – what I felt. Because cinema is about emotion.”During the process of making The Voice of Hind Rajab, she kept going back to the first time she heard that voice and what she felt. “This sense of helplessness. I thought, ‘If I am feeling this, what was it like for the real people who were listening?’ What they felt is a condensation of what we are feeling – so many of us around the world – about what is happening in Gaza. This sense of helplessness. Nobody can reach her to help.”View image in fullscreenA rescue worker pinpoints Hind’s position in an image from the film.Photograph: Ent-movie/AlamyThe film acutely conveys the torment of the two men and two women who are in the emergency call centre. They know there is an ambulance in Gaza City just a few minutes away from Hind and ready to go. But the PRCS has to formally request, through intermediaries, the Israeli army’s permission to approach the area. That permission does not come for hours, as the wounded girl audibly begins to fade.Send the ambulance anyway, the younger man in the call centre demands, at the end of his tether. But his boss has seen too many ambulance workers die. Their pictures are up on his wall and he has pledged to resign if any more are killed on his watch. In the end, the green light finally comes, but Hind cannot be saved.Ben Hania realised she had managed to pierce, however fleetingly, the global impassivity towards slaughter in GazaEven though the audience knows how the story ends, it is still heartbreaking. It is easier to look away than to witness the killing of a child in harrowing detail. Ben Hania feared her film could simply fade into obscurity, a subtitled Arabic tale of something too hard to face. But at a critical moment, a group of Hollywood stars – including Brad Pitt, Joaquin Phoenix and Rooney Mara, together with directors Alfonso Cuarón and Jonathan Glazer – stepped in to back the project as executive producers.The film was picked by the Venice film festival where it premiered in September, receiving a23-minute standing ovation, the longest in the festival’s history. It could have gone on longer, but the cinema had to be cleared so the next movie could be shown. It was only at that moment that Ben Hania realised she had managed to pierce, however fleetingly, the global impassivity that has surrounded two years of slaughter in Gaza.“So many children have been killed that we are entering a zone of amnesia and insensitivity,” she says. “We’re numb, but cinema, literature and art can change things. At some point, you are done explaining. It is now about feeling what it is like to be in someone else’s shoes. That is another level – and cinema can do this.”The Voice of Hind Rajab is released in the UK on 16 JanuaryExplore more on these topicsFilmIsrael-Gaza warPalestineMiddle East and north AfricafeaturesShareReuse this content"

Tucked just inside the M25, Crews Hill near Enfield has been home to a cluster of horticultural businesses for decades, leading to it being nicknamed the “golden mile”.Many of these small, family-run businesses – selling plants, fencing and paving – fear they will be closed down and forced to move if the government selects Crews Hill and nearby Chase Park as one of its next generation of new towns.This part of Enfield’s green belt is among adozen locations across Englandrecommended by the new towns taskforce. The housing secretary, Steve Reed, identified Crews Hill asone of the most promising sites, alongside thevillage of Tempsfordin Bedfordshire and Leeds South Bank.With figuresreleased on Wednesdayshowing housebuilding mired in the deepest slump since the start of the Covid pandemic, the project’s significance to Labour’s goal ofbuilding 1.5m homesduring this parliament has only increased.View image in fullscreenThe garden centres of Crews Hill.Photograph: Sarah Lee/The GuardianAcross 884 hectares (2,184 acres), Crews Hill is home to just 500 people and the garden centres, and also has a golf course, hospital and railway station.A plan to develop 21,000 homes, with a target for 50% to be affordable, would see the population balloon. Proponents say it would provide much-needed housing for families and workers in the capital and would also provide local services including shops, schools and doctors’ surgeries. There would also be improved transport links into central London, beyond the current four trains an hour at peak times, which run to Moorgate in the City.Ministers will decide on the location of new towns this spring. The programme has beencriticised by plannersbehind postwar new towns, including Milton Keynes, for a lack of ambition and insufficient commitment to social housing. Opponents have also raised concerns over potential strains on existing infrastructure during construction.A spokesperson for the Ministry ofHousing, Communities and Local Government (MHCLG) said they would “restore the dream of home ownership for families across the country”.Months before a decision, Crews Hill business owners including Emma Breeze say the proposed development is already denting trade. Three Counties Garden and Leisure Buildings has sold garden sheds, workshops and summerhouses from its site at Culver garden centre since 1988, when it was set up by Breeze’s late father.View image in fullscreenEmma Breeze, owner of Three Counties Garden and Leisure Buildings.Photograph: Sarah Lee/The Guardian“When people come in, they say: ‘There’s a 10-year guarantee on your buildings and products, what will happen if you aren’t here?’ And I’m adamantly saying to people: ‘Nothing’s set in stone, we are still here’,” said Breeze, who started running the business in 2006.“We don’t want to go anywhere, but if it comes to it we will be looking at moving, not closing. We’re in limbo at the moment.”Breeze and other local traders take issue with thetaskforce’s September report, which said Crews Hill offered a “unique opportunity to create a new, family-centred community” by “leading the way in releasing poor-quality green belt land for sustainable, quality development”.“To be told you are ‘low value’ is quite horrendous,” Breeze said, sitting in a wood-panelled office next to a framed family photo. “It puts pressure on you as a business owner to try to reassure your staff when you don’t know what’s happening.”Her views are shared by her neighbour Simon Aylward, the owner of Aylwards, a fencing trader, which occupies about half a hectare of the 2.4-hectare Culver site. Aylward’s son and niece are the third generation to work for the nearly 40-year-old business and he insists there is widespread local opposition to the plans.“We have become part of the fabric of the local area,” Aylward said. “The fact there is a threat we could be gone, people are understandably upset and outraged. Until now our voices seem to fall on closed ears.”While Crews Hill is now known for its garden centres, they are just the latest chapter in its long history. It is named after a local man, William Crew, who became something of a folk hero in the 18th century aftershooting a gang of deer thievesat Enfield Chase, an ancient royal hunting ground.Long before the arrival of the London orbital motorway, the site then became arable land. At the start of the 20th century, glasshouses were built to growfresh produce and cut flowersto satisfy London appetites. As cheaper flower imports from Holland grew in popularity, the greenhouses were turned into garden centres.The new town proposal isn’t the first time Crews Hill’s potential has been spotted to tackle a severe housing shortage. Enfield council previously proposed building 5,500 homes there, alongside 3,500 homes at Chase Park. It was seen as an advantage that one of the area’s main landowners is the London borough of Enfield, along with a small number of developers and private owners.Some private landowners have no intention of selling up, even if they agree Enfield needs new homes. Nina Barnes says her opposition to the Crews Hill development isn’t nimbyism (not in my back yard), even though the plans would lead to new houses being built in her actual back yard.Barnes, 50, now owns the Culver garden centre site first bought by her late father in 1973, and has always lived there.“Why am I going to willingly sell up a successful business?” she asked. “When they say ‘nimbyism’, I’m not thinking of my back yard, I’m thinking of the people who have got mortgages to pay, who employ the staff on site. It’s a family that we’ve built around here with all these tenants. We’ve even watched their kids come along and work in their shops.”Margo, a rescued ruby macaw, now rules the roost at the Enfield Bird Centre, first opened 40 years ago by Tony Wyllie, the father of Barnes’s current tenant Trevor.Barnes and Wyllie are among those who think other areas in the borough – such as former industrial sites and brownfield land – would be more suitable for large-scale development.“Enfield needs homes, but there are so many empty sites in Enfield which they have cleared but never built on,” Wyllie said over the sound of chirping and tweeting from scores of birds in cages. Barnes and other business owners are unsure whether they would be paid compensation if they are forced to move.View image in fullscreenTrevor Wyllie, owner of Enfield Bird Centre in Crews Hill.Photograph: Joanna Partridge/The GuardianEnfield council’s track record of delivering housing developments, including its Meridian Water project, is criticised by many. By the end of 2025, 300 homes will have been built there, of a long-term goal of 10,000. This is behind schedule, even according to the Labour-run council’s ownearlier projections.Housing campaigners have cautiously welcomed the Crews Hill new town proposal and many believe it is better going big than planning small, scattered developments to meet Labour’s housebuilding goal, which is seen as ambitious.A MHCLG spokesperson said: “We recognise the valuable contribution of local businesses and will work closely with communities to understand the impacts of any potential development.”The leader of Enfield council, Ergin Erbil, said the local authority would be involved in any new town development, which was “not just about homes”. “It would also bring significant investment and improved infrastructure into the borough,” he said. The council believes construction could begin before the end of the decade.“The work I’m trying to do in Enfield is build family-size council and affordable homes on areas such as golf courses, farms that aren’t actively farmed, inaccessible low-grade fields, some garden centres and car parks that have been mislabelled as green belt,” Erbil said.Matt Burn, of the campaign group Better Homes for Enfield, said Crews Hill could “play a meaningful role in delivering the affordable social rental homes Enfield and London need”, even if this wouldn’t solve the current housing challenge.He conceded Crews Hill and other green belt land should therefore be considered, but added: “We don’t think that means you need to steamroller over without any thought to current businesses.”Better Homes for Enfieldhas calculatedthat more than 1,000 local jobs were lost when businesses at Meridian Water were closed down to make way for development, much of which has not yet taken place.Burn wants local and national authorities to work with local businesses this time around. “These businesses are not blockers, they’re the real builders, the people who bring the money, create the jobs and you should not mark them out,” he said.Explore more on these topicsSmall businessHousingPlanning policyLondonfeaturesShareReuse this content"

He said he was concerned it would “benefit huge numbers of foreign-born people”.Reeves said those comments were akin to saying some families deserved to have children in poverty. “I don’t really care what colour a kid’s skin is – some deserve to be in poverty and some don’t? That makes me pretty angry,” she said.“DoesNigel Faragewant to go around and say: ‘White? Yeah, you can have the money. Black? No, I’m sorry, it’s not for you.’ What sort of country does he think we are?“If you’re the mum next door who works in the NHS, has lived here all her life, her kids lived here all their life, but she was born somewhere else – we’re saying that that family deserves to grow up in poverty whereas the one next door doesn’t? That’s not the sort of country I believe in.”Keir Starmer will champion the lifting of the cap on a visit to Bedfordshire on Thursday, saying Reform and the Conservatives’ opposition to the change “exposes the deep division and decline” of their agendas.“Nigel Farage seems intent on linking arms with the Conservatives in a cruel alliance to push kids who need help back into poverty. This child poverty pact is something that should worry us all. These aren’t numbers on a spreadsheet – these are children’s life chances at stake,” the prime minister will say.Analysis byLabouron Farage’s proposal to only give additional benefits to households with two working parents born in the UK suggests the policy would help just 3,700 – less than 1% of those affected by the two-child limit.View image in fullscreenOn Wednesday, Nigel Farage again shifted his denial of allegations of racist and antisemitic bullying during his time at Dulwich college.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesIn the same press conference on Wednesday, Farage again shifted his denial of allegations of racist and antisemitic bullying during his time at Dulwich college.He previously said he did not recognise the events described by more than 30 people who have spoken to the Guardian, or that he would never deliberately abuse someone “in a hurtful or insulting way”. But on Wednesday Farage said: “Some of what is out there is just absolute nonsense made by people with very obvious, if you look, political motivation.”Amid boos from Reform members directed at the ITV journalist who asked why he had not apologised to his accusers, Farage said: “I don’t apologise for things that are complete made-up fantasies.”Reeves said there would now be a big battle to win over public opinion to back the measure that could lift 550,000 children out of poverty – and that Reform and the Conservatives would press to undo the change.“I think we did it in the right way, but when we announced it this year, we’re not hanging around, it comes in in April,” she said, speaking after a reception for child poverty campaigners who urged her to be more vocal in defending the policy to win over sceptics.“We’ve both managed to return stability but also deliver on our values of reducing child poverty and increasing social justice. It’s not good enough just to win the argument with the government and with the Labour party, we’ve got to make sure that no party ever feels that they can get away with reversing this policy. And that comes from public consent. And also, frankly, it comes from not electing the Tories or Reform.”Reeves said Labour would not shy away from using the measure as a way to win back progressive voters angered by aspects of the government’s agenda.“When people say, oh, there’s no difference, and what’s the point of voting Labour – there’s 550,000 kids at the end of this parliament [who] are going to be growing up in a house without mould, where the mum and the kids are going be able to afford to eat and not go to school or work hungry. If anyone thinks that that is not worth voting for then I don’t know what is, because this is everything.”Farage, asked how he would vote on the bill to lift the cap, told a press conference his comments about supporting an end to the cap had been misinterpreted.“I was trying to be pro-family, pro-children, pro-working people who find it very, very hard to pay for childcare. It’s a disincentive for them to have children and to go to work at the same time,” he said. “I think the way this government is doing it … looking at some of the stats, it’s going to start to benefit huge numbers of foreign-born people. And that goes back to this point.“We have to prioritise British-born people, whether it’s for child benefit or whether it’s for social housing. And so I think when it comes, we will vote against it.”Explore more on these topicsRachel ReevesNigel FarageLabourReform UKChild benefitsnewsShareReuse this content"

Heller said she saw a car blocking traffic that appeared to be part of a protest against the ICE operation, and heard an agent telling the driver, a woman, to “get out of here”.Shock and outrage at scene of Minneapolis ICE shooting: ‘This is just sad’Read more“She was trying to turn around, and the ICE agent was in front of her car, and he pulled out a gun and put it right in – like his midriff was on her bumper – and he reached across the hood of the car and shot her in the face like three, four times,” Hellertold MPR News, a Minneapolis public radio station.The woman has been identified as 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good, the Minnesota Star Tribunereported.Speaking to the outlet, Good’s mother, Donna Ganger, said her daughter had been living in the Twin Cities with her partner. She said that her daughter was “not part of anything like that at all”, referring to protesters who have challenged ICE’s presence inMinnesota.“Renee was one of the kindest people I’ve ever known … She was extremely compassionate. She’s taken care of people all her life. She was loving, forgiving and affectionate. She was an amazing human being,” Ganger told the outlet.Avideo posted onlineby the Minnesota Reformer and another video obtained by the Guardian appeared to capture the moment of the shooting as a dark red SUV drove away from agents moving toward it, although the front of the vehicle is obscured.The fatal shooting by a federal officer on Wednesday took place less than a mile fromwhere George Floyd was murderedby a Minneapolis police officer in 2020, prompting mass protests.In apost on X, the homeland security department (DHS) said the person was a “domestic terrorist” who “weaponized her vehicle” and attempted “to run over our law enforcement officers in an attempt to kill them”.The department claimed several ICE officers were hurt, but said that they were expected to make “full recoveries”.“An ICE officer, fearing for his life, the lives of his fellow law enforcement and the safety of the public, fired defensive shots. He used his training and saved his own life and that of his fellow officers,” the DHS post said.The videos appeared to contradict that statement, showing the SUV clearly backing up away from ICE officers as they approach. One ICE officer can be seen partially in front of the car as it moves forward and then away from the officers. That same ICE officer is seen firing his gun as the car appears to drive by him. Three gunshots can be heard ringing out.There is no visible sign in the videos of ICE officers being injured. The agent who appeared to have fired the fatal shots is seen returning to a silver SUV that was driven away from the scene shortly after – through a red traffic light.In a press conference, Jacob Frey, the mayor of Minneapolis, emphasized that the priority of local law enforcement was to get the victim to the hospital, and then to remove ICE from the scene because they were “making a difficult situation more problematic”.He also noted that the video footage does not appear to show that a vehicle was being weaponized against the ICE officer.Frey evenissuedan emphatic statement to ICE directly: “I do have a message for our community for our city and I do have a message for ICE. To ICE, get the fuck out of Minneapolis. We do not want you here. Your stated reason for being in this city is to create some kind of safety and you are doing exactly the opposite.“People are being hurt. Families are being ripped apart. Long-term Minneapolis residents that have contributed so greatly to our city, to our culture, to our economy are being terrorized, and now, somebody is dead.Continuing to address ICE, Frey said: “That’s on you. It’s also on you to leave. It’s on you to make sure that further damage, further loss of life and injury, is not done.”The mayor also said that DHS was “trying to spin this as an action of self-defense. Having seen the video myself, I want to tell everybody directly, that is bullshit.”The Minneapolis chief of police, Brian O’Hara, said: “This woman was in her car and it appears then blocking the street because of the presence of federal law enforcement, which is obviously something that has been happening not just in Minneapolis but around the country.”The woman was no longer in the car when he arrived on the scene, O’Hara said, adding that “a spouse” had since arrived at the hospital. The police chief said the FBI would conduct a joint investigation with the Minnesota bureau of criminal apprehension.Tim Walz, the Democratic governor whoannouncedthis week he would not run for a third term,postedon X that he had “seen the video. Don’t believe this propaganda machine. The state will ensure there is a full, fair, and expeditious investigation to ensure accountability and justice.”Walz later said he had activated the state’s emergency operations center and “issued a warning order to prepare the Minnesota national guard”.“We’ve been warning for weeks that the Trump administration’s dangerous, sensationalized operations are a threat to our public safety, that someone was going to get hurt,” Walz said.To Minnesotans, Walz said: “I feel your anger, I’m angry.” He urged residents who plan on protesting to “please do so peacefully”.Walz also said that the state did not “need any further help from the federal government”, adding: “To Donald Trump and Kristi Noem, you’ve done enough.”Omar also rejected claims made by DHS onXin a Wednesday afternoon post: “You’re lying. There was no attempt to run the officer over and no ICE agents appear to be hurt. Get out of our city.”In a statement on Truth Social, Donald Trump defended the ICE officers, saying he had watched a video clip of the incident and called it a “horrible thing to watch”.Trump called one of the witnesses a “professional agitator” and described the woman driving the car as “very disorderly, obstructing and resisting” and said she “violently, willfully, and viciously ran over the ICE Officer, who seems to have shot her in self defense”.“Based on the attached clip, it is hard to believe he is alive, but is now recovering in the hospital,” Trump said. “The situation is being studied, in its entirety, but the reason these incidents are happening is because the Radical Left is threatening, assaulting, and targeting our Law Enforcement Officers and ICE Agents on a daily basis.”Protesters gathered close to the scene in the south of the city shortly after the shooting, with law enforcement officers firing chemical irritants in an attempt to disperse them.In video footage, bystanders can been seen and heard blowing whistles and taunting the agents, telling them to go home. A womansaidshe had spoken to an eyewitness who told her the person shot was a woman who “took off” from federal agents.“They shot her through the windshield. They shot her in the face,” the woman said.Jon Collins, a reporter for MPR News, posted to Bluesky that protesters stopped ICE agents after the shooting and were pepper-sprayed.“ICE teargassed a lot of people as they drove down the alley. People were stuck in the alley and hit hard. Some people are still getting medical treatment,” hewrote.The Department of Homeland Security said on Tuesday it had launched an extraordinary immigration enforcement operation, with 2,000 agents and officers expected in the Minneapolis and St Paul area for a crackdown tied in part to allegations of fraud involving Somali residents.The Immigration Defense Network, a coalition of groups serving immigrants in Minnesota, held a training session Tuesday night for about 100 people who are willing to hit the streets to monitor the federal enforcement.Explore more on these topicsMinneapolisTrump administrationUS immigrationUS politicsICE (US Immigration and Customs Enforcement)MinnesotanewsShareReuse this content"

Trump – who calls climate change a hoax – withdrew from that agreement soon after reclaiming the White House.Mainstream scientists say the climate crisis is behind increasing instances of deadly and costly extreme weather, including flooding, droughts, wildfires, intense rainfall events and dangerous heat.The US withdrawal could hinder global efforts to curb greenhouse gases because it “gives other nations the excuse to delay their own actions and commitments,” said Stanford University climate scientist Rob Jackson, who chairs the Global Carbon Project, a group of scientists that tracks countries’ carbon dioxide emissions.It also will be difficult to achieve meaningful progress on the climate crisis without cooperation from the US, one of the world’s largest emitters and economies, experts said.The UN’s population agency, which provides sexual and reproductive health across the world, has long been a lightning rod for Republican opposition and Trump himself cut funding for the agency during his first term in office. He and other GOP officials have accused the agency of participating in “coercive abortion practices” in countries like China.When Joe Biden took office in January 2021, he restored funding for the agency. A state department review conducted the following year found no evidence to support these claims.Other organizations and agencies that the US will quit include the Carbon Free Energy Compact, the United Nations University, the International Cotton Advisory Committee, the International Tropical Timber Organization, the Partnership for Atlantic Cooperation, the Pan-American Institute for Geography and History, the International Federation of Arts Councils and Culture Agencies and the International Lead and Zinc Study Group.The state department said additional reviews are ongoing.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpTrump administrationUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

They’ve often been very open about ruling things in and basically broadcasting their foreign policy strategy to the rest of the world – not just to our allies, but most egregiously to our adversaries. That’s not something this president does.“All options are always on the table … But I will just say that the president’s first option always has been diplomacy.”Leavitt was also pressed on what the US would gain by controling Greenland that it did not have already in its access to military bases there. “More control over the Arctic region and ensuring that China and Russia and our adversaries cannot continue their aggression in this very important and strategic region,” she said.TheUK’s prime minister, Keir Starmer, “set out his position on Greenland” in a phone conversation with Trump on Wednesday evening, Downing Street said without giving further details of the call.Starmer has repeatedly said the territory’s future must be a matter for Greenland and Denmark alone, including in the Commons earlier on Wednesday.Trump said on Wednesday that the US would not desert Nato in a backhanded social media post that also criticised the alliance.“We will always be there for Nato, even if they won’t be there for us,” he wrote on Truth Social. Russia and China would “have zero fear” of Nato without the US, he said. Addressing “all of those big Nato fans”, he added: “They were at 2% GDP, and most weren’t paying their bills, UNTIL I CAME ALONG.”After one of Trump’s leading aides said on Tuesday that the US may be willing to seize control of the Arctic territory by force, European leaders rallied around Denmark and Greenland with a rare rebuke to the White House, declaring that Greenland “belongs to its people”.Barrot said that in a phone call on Tuesday Rubio had told him that he had “ruled out the possibility of an invasion” of Greenland. “I myself was on the phone yesterday with Marco Rubio … who confirmed that this was not the approach taken,” he said.Trump has long expressed an interest in acquiring Greenland. But in recent days, after the US military operation in Venezuela on Saturday in whichtroops removed the country’s president, Nicolás Maduro, the Trump administration’s rhetoric – and, subsequently, international tensions – have ramped up to new heights, putting the survival of Nato into question.On Tuesday night, the Danish parliament held an extraordinary meeting to discuss the unprecedented situation.Lars Løkke Rasmussen, the Danish foreign minister, and his Greenlandic counterpart, Vivian Motzfeldt, said they were seeking an urgent meeting with Rubio to discuss Greenland. “We would like to add some nuance to the conversation,” Rasmussen said on social media. “The shouting match must be replaced by a more sensible dialogue. Now.”Trump has claimed that Greenland is “full of Chinese and Russian ships” and that Denmark is incapable of defending Greenland, which the president has said is vital for US national security.But Rasmussen said after the extraordinary meeting that the US was giving a false representation of what was happening in Greenland. “The image that is being painted of Russian and Chinese ships right inside the Nuuk fjord and massive Chinese investments being made is not correct,” he said.The situation, Rasmussen said, was “based on a misreading of what is up and what is down”, adding: “We are looking after the kingdom.”Denmark’s defence minister, Troels Lund Poulsen, disputed US claims that the country was not doing enough to protect Greenland. “We have invested close to 100bn [Danish kroner] (£11.6bn) in security capabilities,” he said.Explore more on these topicsGreenlandDenmarkFranceUS foreign policyDonald TrumpTrump administrationEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Only those we shared this time with could understand how this went on for so long.“Neither us nor Josh’s brother can imagine life without him, and as we adjust to this new world and only just begin our journey with grief, we ask that our privacy is respected.”The force has referred itself to the Independent Office for Police Conduct over its identification process.Johnson’s family added: “Whilst he was 18 and exploring his independence, he was ever so genuine in his care for others – us, his brother, his grandparents, his extended family, and his many friends.“Many of our happiest family memories were made whilst stock car racing. As new parents, we took Josh to his first stock car meeting at just six weeks old and he’s had a passion for this ever since.”Police previously said an 18-year-old was arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving and a 19-year-old was held on suspicion of perverting the course of justice.Both have been bailed pending further inquiries.Explore more on these topicsUK newsEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

It had no oil onboard – but was it carrying Russian weapons?ByTural Ahmedzade,Harvey Symons,Oliver HolmesandDan SabbaghWed 7 Jan 2026 11.56 ESTLast modified on Wed 7 Jan 2026 18.49 ESTShareAmassive, rusty crude oil tanker floating north through the Atlantic has become the centre of global interest after it was followed for days and eventuallyseized by US forceswhile Russia’s military rushed towards it.Despite not carrying any oil, the 300-metre-long ship is clearly of value. Theories for why range from speculation that high-value Russian weapons are hidden in the hull, to the ship’s potential to become a symbolic trophy in a transatlantic power struggle between Washington and Moscow.Currently called the Marinera, the ship is alleged to be part of the shadow or “ghost” fleets used by Russia, Iran andVenezuelato avoid western sanctions. For years these vessels have moved cargo and cheap fuel around the globe, including to China.Washington and its European allies have long sought to crack down on the illicit maritime trade. Those efforts reached a critical point last month after Donald Trumpimposed a naval blockade on sanctions-busting tankersoperating near Venezuela, home to the world’s largest oil reserves and a key destination for shadow fleet vessels.The Marinera is among the dozen or so oil tankers that have been trying to escape the blockade. It evaded capture in the Caribbean Sea in December, changed its name from Bella 1 and switched course towards northern Russia before being boarded on Wednesday as it sailed in the frigid Atlantic.Marinera route mapThe Marinera has been under sanctions from the US treasurysince June 2024over accusations of carrying illicit cargo for Hezbollah, an Iranian-backed Lebanese militant group.The US Coast Guard attempted to board it in the Caribbean in December as it headed for Venezuela, but the ship’s crew refused.View image in fullscreenA member of the US Coast Guard observing a Venezuela-linked oil tanker.Photograph: @US_EUCOM/X/PAThere is precedent for the US boarding shadow fleet ships. Last month, US special forces rappelled from helicopters toboard the Skipper,a tanker off Venezuela that the US treasury had placed under sanctions in 2022. On Wednesday, US Coast Guard members were seen boarding a tanker in international waters near the Caribbean.US forces board the M Sophia in a pre-dawn operation in the CaribbeanUS forces board the M Sophia in a pre-dawn operation in the CaribbeanBut doing the same on the Marinera is very different and has much higher stakes. While the Skipper was sailing under the flag of Guyana, the Marinera is Russian registered and flagged.That is a recent development: the tanker’s crew hurriedly painted a Russian flag on the hull last month. Moscow later lodged a formal diplomatic protest demanding that Washington halt its high-seas pursuit.It is not the only tanker operating in Venezuelan waters to be reflagged under the Russian banner in recent weeks. By putting its own flag on some former shadow fleet tankers, Moscow has in effect moved shadow fleet vessels out of the shadows, in an open challenge to the west.Craig Kennedy, an associate at Harvard University’s Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies, said the decision by Moscow to register the ship could have been an attempt to gain leverage by circumventing the US oil blockade on Venezuela.“To seize a Russian-flagged ship on the high seas is to disregard Russia’s claims of exclusive jurisdiction over the vessel,” said Kennedy, adding that Moscow may have assumed the US would not board a Russian-flagged vessel.Russian state media footage allegedly shows a US helicopter approaching the oil tanker in European waters.Photograph: XBut the Kremlin miscalculated how far Trump would go, Kennedy said. Last weekend, US forces carried out a pre-dawncapture of Venezuela’s president, Nicolás Maduro, and his wife, Cilia Flores, who are now on trial in New York.“This was Russia trying to gain leverage by intervening in the US blockade,” Kennedy said. “And then it backfired.”Other theories suggest there may be something of value to Moscow within the ship. While it is empty of oil, the route it previously took between Iran and Venezuela is suspected of being a path for illicit trade, including for weapons.Upping the stakes, Russia this week dispatched naval assets, including a submarine, to escort the tanker, according to the Wall Street Journal. That was reported hours before US forces boarded the ship, when Washington announced the ship had been seized for “violations of US sanctions”.For days, US surveillance planes had been monitoring the ship, and a British Royal Air Force spy plane appears to have flown over its path. Flight-tracking platforms showed an RAF RC-135W Rivet Joint surveillance plane leaving the Waddington airbase in Lincolnshire on Tuesday towards the same area of the Atlantic as the ship.The UK military said itprovided “pre-planned operational support, including basing”. And in recent days tracking data and spotters had shown a sudden influx of US military, including the C-17 Globemaster III, which can carry helicopters, raising speculation about an imminent special operations mission against the Marinera.Speaking before US forces boarded the ship, John Foreman, a former UK defence attache to Moscow, said the scale of the US monitoring of the tanker and apparent preparations for its seizure by moving aircraft to the nearby UK was eye-catching.“Why have the US put all these assets into the UK just for some oil tanker?” said the former official, now a defence analyst. “Could it be Russian arms going to Venezuela?”Explore more on these topicsWater transportRussiaVenezuelaEuropeShipping industryexplainersShareReuse this content"

It’s times like these one is grateful for a strong and healthy shoulder.“If you’ve got a strong and mobile shoulder, you have the control to reduce the risk of anything [bad] happening,” says Dr Josh Zadro, a physiotherapist and senior research fellow at the University of Sydney.We often ignore our shoulders until they scream for attention, but prevention is far more effective than treatment, says Dr Anelise Silveira, a physiotherapist and researcher at the University of Queensland.Here experts guide us through the principles of maintaining healthy shoulders:Use your full range of motion dailyAccording to Zadro, problems arise when we stop moving entirely.“There’s not one perfect posture,” he says. “People move and sit in a variety of ways … we’re not worried about that.”My rookie era: I’m learning to swim in the ocean, braving the waves and marine lifeRead moreHe says “motion is lotion” – as we age and naturally lose mobility, shoulder health will decline. To remedy this, he recommends taking your shoulders through their full range of motion daily:Arm circles:Large, controlled circles in front of your body.The wall slide:Face a wall and slide your hands up as high as possible.The overhead reach:Stretch your arms to the ceiling to counteract the forward hunch of computer work.“Rather than trying to completely change the way people sit or work, it’s just a matter of getting out of those postures regularly,” Zadro says.Silveira agrees, explaining that staying still for too long compresses tendons and the bursa – a small, fluid-filled sack that reduces friction between bones, tendons and muscles – leading to stiffness. Her advice for busy workers is to set a phone timer for every hour or two.When it buzzes, perform a quick reset: check if you are slumping, then roll your shoulders back, around and down. Hold for five to 10 seconds and repeat up to 10 times.“The goal is to become aware of your shoulders, strengthen the muscles and build a habit of adjusting.”Strengthen shoulders safelyThe shoulder relies on a team of muscles to function, including the rotator cuff – a group of muscles and tendons that supports and stabilises the arm at the shoulder joint –and the larger muscles across the front and back, Zadro says.Prof George Murrell, a shoulder specialist, says that safe strengthening helps healthy shoulders.He recommends low-impact options like swimming breaststroke, which he describes as “kind” to the joint, or using a rowing machine on a light setting to work the back of the shoulder and core without stressing the rotator cuff tendons.View image in fullscreenPerforming a simple routine with a resistance band a few times a week can strengthen the rotator cuff.Photograph: Tony Anderson/Getty ImagesFor a home setup, Zadro recommends grabbing a resistance band and performing a simple routine two to three times a week. The first exercise he suggests is the “stand and lift”, where you stand on the band and lift your arm to the side, then front, then overhead. He also recommends a move called “the door anchor”: for this, loop the band around a closed door handle. Face the door to pull (rowing motion), or face away to push (press motion), using the door as an anchor – hence the name.Zadro says there is “no golden number of sets or reps”. Exercise until the muscle feels fatigued and the movement becomes difficult.Silveira warns that even fit people who go to the gym and train a lot can have weak rotator cuffs and recommends isolating these muscles with rotations.For an external rotation, keep your elbow at 90 degrees, tucked against your side and, while holding a resistanceband or light weight, rotate the forearm outwards (away from your belly). Do the opposite for an internal rotation, moving the forearm inwards across your stomach. Once the movement feels easy, you can either add weight or increase your range of motion.Increase new activities graduallyA fast way to wreck a healthy shoulder is a sudden spike in intense activity, Murrell says. Overworking the rotator cuff can lead to tendinopathy (tendon injury) and bursitis (inflammation).He cautions against diving into high-intensity training programs like CrossFit without a strong exercise background, as high loads in a competitive environment can push the shoulder into a danger zone.‘They don’t have a nice socket structure’: how to really look after your kneesRead moreThis applies to incidental exercise, too. Experts say we must be mindful of activities requiring repetitive overhead movement that the body isn’t conditioned for, such as painting a house or returning to tennis after a long break.Silveira urges consistency over intensity. “You cannot go to the gym and expect to lift 50kg on your first day,” she says.Zadro agrees: “A lot of shoulder problems happen when people suddenly take on a new or big load.”Listen to painWhile these tips reflect best practice, the experts say if you experience pain, consult a health professional.“Pain is our best friend,” Silveira says. “It tells you something is not quite right.”Murrell suggests backing off aggravating movements immediately. He says that pain often causes people to stop using the shoulder joint proper (the ball and socket) and over-rely on the trapezius muscles to compensate.A physiotherapist can spot these red flags, correct your movement patterns and guide you back into safe exercise once inflammation subsides.Explore more on these topicsLife and styleThe way you moveHealth & wellbeingFitnessfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It’s a soothing balm that’s ideal for lovers of farceLucy ManganWed 7 Jan 2026 17.00 ESTShareDebbie Fendon is a force to be reckoned with. A speed-walking, recently widowed stalwart of the local community, mother of one (the easily overwhelmed Harry), she is played byDawn Frenchwith a mixture of the vicar of Dibley’s indefatigable energy, edged with a hint of the shimmering wildness that accompanied her best work in the days of French and Saunders. Debbie is the driving force in Simon Mayhew-Archer’s debut sitcom Can You Keep a Secret? – and that secret is that Debbie’s husband, William, was mistakenly declared dead after taking too much of his Parkinson’s medication, by a germ-phobic doctor who didn’t want to get too near the body. Debbie persuaded William to stay “dead” for the life insurance payout, which she now has in cash, in a large holdall under the stairs.What kind of a husband could be persuaded to do such a thing, you wonder? But then William turns out to be played by Mark Heap, and anything becomes possible. William was always hermit-like and now it is simply enforced. “The wonderful thing about you,” Debbie says, “is that you might as well have been dead for the last 68 years.” When he does start longing for the occasional trip to the shops, she is baffled. “What are you going to start missing next? Laser Quest?”Harry (Craig Roberts), who had been grieving deeply for his late father, is traumatised by both the deception and the criminality around it. Not least because his wife, Neha (Mandip Gill), is a police officer (albeit one whose time is mostly taken up by Pigfish, a local man with a propensity for sticking the nozzles of petrol pumps up his bum), and Harry can neither safely tell her the truth nor live comfortably with a lie.View image in fullscreenMandip Gill (Neha) in Can You Keep a Secret?Photograph: BBC/PANevertheless, the cash is handy and buys his silence for a while. The script is careful to keep us on the Fendons’ side, noting that Debbie and William were denied the payout after his diagnosis and that the money is for normal expenses, not for them to live in the lap of luxury. They followed all the rules, says Debbie at one point, and what did it get them? “A dodgy boiler and a garden full of fox shit.”There is an underlying melancholy – shading occasionally into bitterness – to Can You Keep a Secret? that anyone brought up on traditional British sitcoms will recognise and warm to. (Simon Mayhew-Archer has family form in the genre: his father, Paul, co-wrote The Vicar of Dibley with Richard Curtis.) This melancholy carries us over the more duff jokes (“You know how I feel about the banks after what they did to Noel Edmonds”, “You run this house like Guantánamo Bay. But with less humanity. Rumsfeld!”) and tireder set pieces: the agonisingly awkward speech Debbie makes at her husband’s memorial service, the hiding of William in the cupboard when the widows’ club comes round and he must wait until the narcoleptic member nods off before making his escape, and so on.So, Harry pays the rent and treats himself to a jet-washer that I certainly hope Pigfish doesn’t hear about, but his guilt grows. Also fuelling the narrative tension are the blackmail notes that start arriving. Somebody else knows William is alive but will only keep the secret for £20,000.There is business with disguises, jump scares, chocolate addiction, weak bladders and “You massive twat” as a repeated punchline. We are not breaking any new ground here. But that’s not always necessary; it would be exhausting if it were. Sometimes it’s enough to do the tried and tested stuff well, and together French and Mayhew-Archer pull it off. Heap’s inimitably weird presence is underused and William seems to come from a slightly different show, but Roberts and Gill do solid work.Can You Keep a Secret? has charm, wit and warmth enough to work as soothing balm rather than riotously fun fare. Though if farce is your thing, you will probably find yourself edging more towards the latter and enjoy yourself very much.

So we should all get behind a new drive to turn them into avid readers. Why not start with books about art?Katy HesselWed 7 Jan 2026 12.06 ESTLast modified on Wed 7 Jan 2026 20.44 ESTShareAgirl on the cusp of adolescencegazes down at a book. Her left hand rests against her flushed pink cheeks, while her right clutches the pages, ready to turn to find out what happens next. She has porcelain-like skin and golden hair seemingly full of air, executed in textures that contrast with the scratchy, loose marks that make up her shirt and the book’s pages. When I look at this drawing, I am struck by how the artist, the American-born impressionist Mary Cassatt, has perfectly captured the all-consuming sensation of being submerged in a book – the feeling that the whole world is dissolving around you. For a moment, only that story matters.Cassatt, who worked in Paris for most of her adult life when women were finally beginning to be accepted as artists (and deserving of state-funded art education), was hailed for her intimate portrayals of women and children. They are glimpses into their minds, their private worlds, yet they also emphasise intellect and ambition.Young Girl Readingis one such example. I often wonder if she is reading something like Louisa May Alcott’s Little Women, published nearly three decades before, which tells the story of the four March sisters, who are figuring out their journey to womanhood themselves.My reader is encouraged to make 'wish trees' in the manner of Yoko OnoIt’s a striking image for many reasons, one that it makes me think about all the works that helped me through adolescence. But it also feels especially pertinent today in a world where being immersed in a story is fast becoming a thing of the past for young people. Instead, it is being replaced with social media addiction that chips away at growing, flourishing brains. In 2025, the NationalLiteracyTrust (NLT) found that the percentage of children and young people in the UK who “enjoyed reading” was at its lowest for 20 years. Fewer than one in five 8-18-year-olds said they read “something daily” in their free time, marking a 36% decrease in enjoyment levels since 2005.That is why the charity is making 2026 the National Year of Reading: a UK-wide, government-supported initiative, driven by the NLT, to help more people rediscover the joy of reading. The aim is to distribute 72,000 new books to children with the greatest need. While Louisa May Alcott might be appealing for some, the campaign wants to find books all children might enjoy – starting with what they’re passionate about, from history to sport, from film to art.View image in fullscreen‘I enjoyed teaching people who had no interest in art’ … Georgia O’Keeffe in Albuquerque, New Mexico, 1960.Photograph: Tony Vaccaro/Getty ImagesI recently read a riveting biography of English footballer Bukayo Saka with my six-year-old nephew, but it is an enjoyment of art that I’m hoping to instil in young readers through my new book,The Story of Art Without Men: An Illustrated Guide to Amazing Women Artists. It’s a version of my2022 book for adults– a play on EH Gombrich’s The Story of Art, which failed to mention a single woman until Käthe Kollwitz was added to its 16th edition. However, this book is really designed for readers of all ages. It is brought to life with beautiful illustrations by Ping Zhu that complement a wide range of artwork from across the globe, shaping the last 500 years of art history.There are new chapters, such as one about the dazzling world of First NationsArtin Australia, inspired by the recent Emily Kam Kngwarray exhibition at Tate Modern in London. The book is also highly interactive. Each chapter is centred on a movement and features an “art task” that, I hope, will not only help my reader understand how a work might relate to their life, but encourage them to make their own version of what they are reading about.When discussing the 17th-century Flemish painter Clara Peeters – known for hiding self-portraits in her still lifes, to make sure no man claimed her work as his own – I ask my reader to conceal a self-portrait in a picture of something else. In the chapter that introduces the postwar world of abstract expressionism, which also had an impact on literature, I ask my reader to make a drawing to accompany their favourite poem. Or get a friend to write one and together think about what colours you might use to capture it – just likeJoan Mitchell and James Schuylerdid. Likewise, my reader is encouraged to make “wish trees”, in the manner of Yoko Ono, or turn their favourite singer or actor into a pop art image. I hope the book will be a great tool for teachers wanting to integrate art into their classrooms, too.View image in fullscreenPainter Joan Mitchell, 1991.Photograph: David Turnley/Corbis/VCG/Getty ImagesGeorgia O’Keeffe, before venturing to New York City and finding fame, taught art in the public school system in Amarillo, Texas. According to her biographer Roxana Robinson, O’Keeffe, far from taking an authoritarian approach, “brought to the study of art a clarity and an attention that the students found exhilarating”. The book emulates her inclusive approach to art education, whatever someone’s background or knowledge. As O’Keeffe once said: “I enjoyed teaching people who had no particular interest in art.”We are lucky in the UK to have free entry to museums’ permanent collections. So let’s not only get young people reading about and looking at art in books, but into museums, too. If a young person says they have no interest in art, then let’s widen the focus to art history, an umbrella that covers many different subjects. What if there’s a painting of your favourite author or musician? Or an artwork that deals with technology or the environment?So if you are keen for your child to partake in the National Year of Reading, why not start with art? It’s an activity that families can do together, at very little cost. That was my way in, as the youngest sibling whose eldest sister encouraged me to get the tube with her and draw what we found. I’m hoping that 2026 will be the year that young people of all backgrounds feel welcome in museum spaces, can find that book for them, rediscover the joy of reading – and have the sensation of Cassatt’s Young Girl Reading.Books and art stimulate the mind. They get us to dream, to imagine worlds beyond our realm, transport us through time, teach us about other people in a way that inadvertently teaches us about ourselves. Above all, they show us that the human imagination is a superpower no machine can replace.The Story of Art Without Men: An Illustrated Guide to Amazing Women Artistsby Katy Hessel is published by Puffin (£20) on 5 MarchExplore more on these topicsBooksOpinionArt (Education)Art (Art and design)Art and design booksWomenPaintingLiteracyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Lightbulb-changers on Clifton Suspension Bridge: Beezer’s best photograph‘I have outtakes of them all standing up – there’s no safety equipment and they’re not hanging on to anything. They just said to me, “Hurry up, Beez!”’Interview byChris BroughtonWed 7 Jan 2026 10.17 ESTLast modified on Wed 7 Jan 2026 12.08 ESTShareAt the age of 12 I was working for the Clash, handing out flyers. I looked older than I was and got to see all the punk bands before getting into reggae sound systems. MulticulturalBristolwas a great place to grow up, and by the time I was 14 or 15 I’d be going out late most nights and coming home mid-morning.Having failed the entrance exam to be a gas fitter, I enrolled on an audio-visual course – one of Thatcher’s newNational Training Initiatives. I specialised in photography and started documenting all those nights out – my friends and the scenes I was already part of – offering an insider’s perspective. Photography also gave me an opportunity to explore new environments. If there’s something you’re not sure about, a camera is a good way to have a look at it, be part of it, and then learn from it.I needed to do a little jump across. The cars below looked like matchboxes, the people like pinheadsAfter college, I got work as a stringer for NME, and also for a Bristol magazine called Venue. This picture was taken for a Venue editorial called Life on the Bridge. I went to get some shots of the Clifton Suspension Bridge and the toll keeper and so on, and on the day I was there a gang of maintenance guys happened to be on site to change the lightbulbs on top of the towers. They said: “Do you want to come up and take a shot of us?” Of course I said: “Yeah!”I had to climb up a ladder at the side of the bridge to the middle of one of the towers, then switch to another ladder. At the top, I needed to do a little jump across to the 150-year-old wooden floor inside the turret of the tower. The gap was only about half a metre, but below me the cars driving across the bridge looked like matchboxes and the people looked like pinheads. I was like: “Fucking hell!”One of the guys came up with me in case I had any problems, the rest started from the middle of the bridge and walked up the chain that held up the suspension cables. This was just before their lunch break, so they didn’t waste any time. I was still thinking about the fact that I’d overcome my vertigo to get up there and was trying to avoid looking down when suddenly there they were on the chain in front of me. I have outtakes of them all still standing up – there’s no safety equipment and they’re not hanging on to anything. Perhaps if the mayor or someone had been visiting they’d have worn harnesses, I don’t know. They just said: “Is this all right? Hurry up, Beez!”It’s 40 years since I took the picture, but it feels like it’s gone in a flash. Actually, I heard that one of those guys only retired last year. If someone asked me to go and shoot the same thing, in the same conditions, I’d probably do it but what with health and safety, a shot like that wouldn’t happen today. I don’t know if they even had any hard hats, no one was wearing one, and I don’t know if the picture caused them any trouble afterwards. But the trust who own the bridge have bought copies of it and I used to see it round Bristol, in restaurants and so on – it’s certainly one of my most popular shots.I’ve been described as a photographer and a historian, which is funny – the work ages, but I’m still around. I’m glad to have left my mark, but the volumes I’ve just brought out are called Until Now: A Life in Photographs because I’m still doing it, and hope to carry on for a long time yet. Still, I look through those older photos and there are so many people in them that aren’t here any more. People don’t last for ever, but photos of them do.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy: BeezerBeezer’s CVBorn:Bristol, 1965High point:“Having 93 simultaneous exhibitions at Adidas stores across Japan when they were the main sponsors of myWild Dayzbook in 2004.

What is the basis of their territorial claim? … The US is the power of Nato … obviously Greenland should be part of the United States.” His wife, Katie Miller,posted an image on Xof a map of the country papered over with the US flag, with the caption “soon”. It’s hard to orientate sensibly towards things that happen on X these days: if she had posted a Grok-generated image of Greenland in a bikini, would that be more or less concerning?Still, we’re right to be concerned. There is no comfort to be had from old-era ideas such as: “Maybe they’re just sabre-rattling aboutGreenlandto distract from the matter of Venezuela”, or “surely the foundational principles of Nato, a defensive alliance, will prevent the US from any act of aggression towards its own allies?”The question is, by what logic does Trump make his claim? He talks a lot about theMonroe doctrine, describes his foreign policy as its “Trump corollary”, but close watchers ofHamilton, the musical, will sniff out immediately that Trump is no heir to the doctrine’s origins in the Federalist papers, which essentially wanted Europe to curtail its colonial ambitions and butt out of the Americas. The 2020s version is fixated with the western hemisphere, which Greenland is in, but Denmark is not. This is the basis for Miller’s confident dismissal of centuries of Scandinavian relationships: the meridian says no.The US national security strategypublished last Novemberuses “hemisphere” incessantly, introducing the idea of “non-hemispheric competitors”, a phrase commentators have now taken up, as if it were a foundational idea in geopolitics, rather than some retro-imperialist garbage invented five minutes ago. The short version is the same as the long version: everything in the western hemisphere must remain “stable and well-governed” enough to serve the US’s interests and prevent mass migration there. Trump’s definition of stability and good governance is antithetical to ours. His ideas on preventing mass migration are necropolitical and feature nothing that would, in real life, prevent it (such as halting runaway climate breakdown and fostering peace). Therefore, as an overriding agenda, this cannot be taken at face value, but rather, as a justification for dominion.If you’re the kind of person who likes clicking on maps, you could spend an enjoyable half hour looking at which bits of the UK Trump could lay claim to, under his hemispheric approach: Norwich would be fine;Scotlandwould not.Which brings us to the next relevant item in their security agenda, a desire to restore “Europe’s civilizational self-confidence and Western identity”. This has been plain since JD Vancehectored European leadersat the Munich Security Conference under a year ago, accusing them of retreating from their “fundamental values” . When he spoke of Christianity and freedom of speech, he meant whiteness and hate speech. That really couldn’t have been plainer. Aleaked documentfrom Marco Rubio to US diplomats, late last year, parroted related white supremacist talking points: migration as a threat to social cohesion and public safety, and its association with violent crime.They have been building an ideological carte blanche to intervene in progressive nations for their own good, the way you’d take a box of matches off a child. Which may be all just talk, but Trump’s talk is so unrestrained, and its wildest excesses so often followed up with action, that at some point we need to come to terms with a fact about this administration: just because it barks, constantly, doesn’t mean its bite won’t be worse.Just as European leaders braced for the unthinkable, military action against a fellow Nato member, Rubio said the rhetoric had all just been to soften up Denmark up for a retail offer: relax everyone, Trump justwants to buy Greenland. His realtor’s logic, which we’ve seen before in despicable remarks about adevastated Gaza, should concern the UK more than anything: he’s already spent two decades buying a chunk of Scotland. His ancestral links, coupled with his golfing ambition, have made Aberdeenshire the petri dish of his identity, as a neighbour, ally, businessman and statesman. When Trump buys a country or part thereof, he makes investment promises he doesn’t keep, he alienates and bullies everyone in the vicinity, he wreaks environmental havoc, he blocks renewables or at least tries to, and he creates aplayground for the super-rich.The organising principles here are domination and expansion. Any leader who thinks they could make their peace with Trump owning Greenland should swap in Scotland and wonder how peaceful they would feel about that.Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionGreenlandScotlandDenmarkTrump administrationMarco RubioEuropecommentShareReuse this content"

I couldn’t agree moreWed 7 Jan 2026 12.56 ESTLast modified on Wed 7 Jan 2026 21.30 ESTShareNews just in: the sky is blue, water is wet, and tracking our kids’ every move with phones or AirTags is causing a “deeply concerning” increase in anxiety among young people, according to more than 70 psychologists, doctors, nurses and health professionals whohave come togetherto urge parents to “reconsider whether the surveillance childhood we are sleepwalking into is really benefiting our children”. They add: “We are implicitly telling them that the world is unsafe,” and warn that constant monitoring prevents kids learning the skills and developing the autonomy necessary to navigate real life.“It’s so normal to want to keep our children safe,” says Clare Fernyhough, co-founder of campaign group Generation Focus. “But there is no evidence that tracking makes them any safer.”It’s also a staggering invasion of privacy. I would never track my son – I’m his mother, not his Big Brother. I tried it once and that was more than enough. In the penultimate year of primary school there was a class trip to Lille. Some mums suggested going in together on a multipack of AirTags, and without really thinking I agreed, and put one in his backpack. On the edge of my seat I watched, more gripped than by every Traitors final ceremony combined, as his little dot inched painfully slowly towards St Pancras station … where it remained, for ever. Technology is great, until it isn’t.Rationally, I knew the chances that he’d been separated from his class, unnoticed, and was just politely waiting at the Eurostar terminal all day long, were slim. I had an irrational breakdown anyway, and needed to be physically restrained from calling the police with one hand while driving at screeching top speed to the station with the other. Genuinely perplexing why anybody would willingly inflict that torture on themselves 24/7. If you’re scrutinising your child’s every step, and they stop walking, how do you know if they’re tying their shoelace, stroking a cat they’ve met in the street, or are hurt or in serious danger? It’s a maddening mix of too much and too little information at once – although a friend showed me her Life360 app, and she could not only see where every member of her family was, but also how long they’d been there, how much battery was left on their phone, and what they were thinking about at that exact moment. (OK, not the last one, but that’s probably coming in the next update.)My son, now 11, recently started secondary school and he gets the bus alone, so we’ve given him a dumbphone for emergencies. Over the summer, before he’d ever undertaken the epic journey 15 minutes up the road, we asked if he’d mind us tracking him. He wondered why we would do that. “If you want to know where I am, you can just ring me,” he said. The logic was hard to argue with.I’m well aware I’m the odd one out here. I’m one of the only parents I know who doesn’t track their child, and at a recent dinner with friends, it transpired that they track their partners’ locations, too. I don’t do that either. It had never come up before, and then suddenly an entire table were staring at me in shock and disbelief. They all thought I was weird, and vice versa.I share my location with my best friend – in case I’m ever kidnapped, murdered or late to meet her – and that’s it. I would consider having my husband under surveillance a violation of trust; plus, it simultaneously forces a relentless level of honesty that no marriage really needs.Also, ugh, get off me. I want to feel independent, not microchipped, like a pet, and I want the same for him. Keeping a constant eye on the person you’re sharing your life with is snooping, in the ballpark of secretly reading their emails or looking at their phone while they’re in the shower. As soon as you get the urge to do it, you have your answer.So much of what people do online they’d never dream of doing in real life, and that’s usually the problem. You wouldn’t physically follow your kids around, sidle up to them behind a newspaper with eye-holes cut out, tail them like a private detective. They need freedom as they grow; teenagers not being entirely honest about what they’re up to is a rite of passage, an essential stage of development on the way to adulthood. The experts raising the alarm about tracking describe it as an “invisible umbilical cord between parent and child”. Perhaps their warning will encourage some to make the snip.Polly Hudson is a freelance journalistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

His refusal to choose leaves vital choices for Britain to be made by othersWed 7 Jan 2026 01.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 7 Jan 2026 09.01 ESTShareFor an inveterate liar, Donald Trump is remarkably honest. The best guide to what he thinks is what he says. When forecasting his likely course of action, start with his declared intentions –removing the president of Venezuela, for example – and assume he means it. When he says the USmust take possession of Greenland, he is not kidding.The motives are sometimes muddled but rarely hidden. Trump likes making deals, especially real estate deals, and money. He wants to be great and to have his greatnessaffirmed with praise and prizes. He craves spectacle. The world as he describes it doesn’t always resemble observable reality, but there is an effortless, sociopathic sincerity to his falsehoods. The truth is whatever he intuits it to be in the moment to advance his interests and manipulate his audience.Trump’s freewheeling brazenness lies at the extreme end of a spectrum where the opposite pole is Keir Starmer’s verbal constipation on camera. It isn’t the most profound difference between the two men, but the contrast reveals something significant about the prime minister’s present difficulties.It isn’t just adeficit of telegenic panache. Saying whatever comes to mind is a privilege of unaccountable power. Trump doesn’t have to care about the consequences of his words. Minding your language for fear of offending a vindictive despot is a habit well known to subjects of authoritarian rule. It has now become the diplomatic mode of the US’s former allies.Trump’s new world order is being born – and Venezuela is just the start | Owen JonesRead moreIt took Downing Street16 hours to commenton the US seizure of Nicolás Maduro from Caracas. The position, once revealed, straddled the gulf between the government’s stated commitment to international law and its undeclared policy of never impugning Trump. Ministers have held that pose now for days. The strain is showing.Given Starmer’s background as a human rights lawyer, he surely has a view on whether governments can legitimately abduct foreign heads of state, regardless of whether they are vicious dictators. It is also part of the normal diplomatic process that he keeps that view private when formulating the official response to the actions of a country on which Britain depends for its security.Trump’s actions in Venezuela, as in so many other areas, invite condemnation on points of principle. But the prime minister has to consider scenarios for the day after condemnation, and the days after that. He looks at his diary and sees a “coalition of the willing” meetingin Paris with fellow European governments that are committed to the defence of Ukraine. Trump’s negotiatorsare attending. At stake is the scope of anyfuture security guaranteesfor Kyiv.Maybe the Americans wouldn’t notice if the UK prime minister had spent the previous 48 hours denouncing their foreign policy with high-minded rhetoric to satisfy backbench Labour MPs. Maybe they wouldn’t care. But maybe they would. Maybe they would insist on a grovelling retraction as the entrance fee back into Trump’s favour.What would Ukrainians under Russian bombardment want Starmer to do? Perhaps they would see the unequivocal assertion of international law regardingVenezuelaas a requirement of moral consistency to reinforce the case against Vladimir Putin for violating their own sovereignty. Or perhaps they would prefer that their European friends simply do whatever it takes to prevent Trump bullying Volodymyr Zelenskyy into accepting Kremlin terms.People can reasonably disagree on whether Starmer has got this choice right. But no one who demands a different course has to weigh the cost of getting it wrong, of saying the wrong thing, as seriously as the prime minister. Saying nothing would obviously be his preference. That option isn’t open when massive international events require a response. So Downing Street does the next best thing, drafting a script that comes as close to saying nothing as words will allow.The defence of this approach is that Starmer’s relations with Trump are better than anyone might have anticipated given their differences of temperament and ideological provenance, and that the national interest is thus served.The evidence is mixed. On the economic front, Britain hasn’t exactly enjoyed leniency under the new US tariff regime, but nor has it been singled out for exceptional punishment. Progress on a “tech prosperity deal”, notionally agreed last September,has stalled. Maga ideologues talk about London as patient zero in a Europe-wide plague of civilisational collapse, spread by non-white immigrants and treatable only by far-right insurrection.With Ukraine, the picture is less bleak. Starmer has played a lead part in the orchestrated campaign by Nato leaders to charm Trump into a more amenable attitude to the alliance and a more sceptical view of Putin. The White House still regularly pings back to indulgence of the Kremlin, but Trump has been successfully persuaded that Europeis now paying for the war. The scorn he once showed for Zelenskyy was closely tied to his horror of the US being ripped off. Neutralising that fear has discernibly curbed his eagerness to throw Ukraine under a Russian tank.If the best that can be said of Europeans coddling Trump is that they are merely postponing the day when the US cuts them adrift, well, that is not a negligible achievement. There could bemerit in flatteryif it delays a US decision to blow up Nato by annexing Danish territory, perhaps even putting it off to the point where a less volatile president sits in the White House. It all depends on how profitably the extra time is spent.And that is where Starmer’s caginess gives the most cause for alarm. There is a valid tactical rationale for the prime minister’s reluctance to criticise the US right now, but it has to serve a strategic recognition that Britain’s future lies with Europe. There is not much evidence that this is the plan. Starmer talks up thevalue of closer economic ties to the EU, but in vague terms and always with the caveat that nothing agreed in Brussels should compromise relations with Washington.If, behind the scenes, Starmer does actually grasp the epic character of the changes that Trump’s presidency is wreaking on the world order, and the way that combines with Brexit to put Britain in a vulnerable position, he is doing a great job of pretending otherwise. Few of his foreign policy positions are asserted so confidently as the denial of any geopolitical dilemma. “I am never going to choose between the US and Europe,” hesaid in an interview last week.He seems to think he can rehabilitate Britain’s late 20th-century role as an Atlantic bridge at the centre of the western alliance. But Trump burns bridges. A highly globalised world is disaggregating into regional and continental blocs. Even with a different US president, the old norms will not spontaneously reassert themselves. Starmer’s determination never to choose amounts to acceptance that vital choices for Britain will be made by others.This quiet inertia is more dangerous than refusal to moralise about illegal escapades in Latin America. There is a realpolitik justification for not calling out Trump’s military gangsterism, but it is also an argument for getting out of the White House protection racket as quickly as possible. The problem with Starmer’s reticence is that, in the context of everything else he says and does, it is indistinguishable from paralysis by indecision. A case could be made for a pragmatic prime minister who sometimes prefers not to speak his mind. But it relies on the audience believing he has something serious in mind that isn’t being spoken.Rafael Behr is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsKeir StarmerOpinionDonald TrumpTrump administrationVenezuelaEuropean UnionUkraineUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

Yet with astonishing cruelty, ministers refuse to listen to their reasonable demandsWed 7 Jan 2026 03.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 7 Jan 2026 07.55 ESTShareThey are far into the lethal zone. Three people who are being held in prison on charges connected with the protest group Palestine Actionhave been on hunger strike for 45, 59 and 66 days. A fourth prisoner,Teuta Hoxha, ended her strikethis week, after 58 days.She could suffer lifelong health effects. The remaining strikers, Heba Muraisi, Kamran Ahmed and Lewie Chiaramello,could pass away at any time. The 10 IRA and INLA hunger strikers who died in 1981 survived for between 46 and 73 days. Muraisi, whose strike has lasted the longest, is, according to supporters,now struggling to breatheand suffering uncontrollable muscle spasms – possible signs of neurological damage. Yet the government refuses to engage.It created this situation.The Crown Prosecution Servicestates that the maximum time a prisoner can spend on remand is 182 days (six months). Yet Muraisi and Ahmed were arrested in November 2024, and are not due to be tried until June at the earliest, which means they will be remanded for 20 months. Chiaramello, who was arrested in July 2025, has a provisional court date in January 2027, which means 18 months in prison without trial.The limbo of remand is often devastating to prisoners’ wellbeing.Government figures, for example, show that the rate of suicide among remanded prisoners is more than twice that among sentenced prisoners. Extreme periods of remand like these are an offence against justice.This is one aspect of what campaigners call “process as punishment”, an approach that now dominates the treatment of protest groups. Even if you are never convicted of a crime, your life is made hell if you dare, visibly and publicly, to dissent.The three prisoners, and others charged with the same offences, are being held under “terrorist conditions”. This means they are allowed only minimal communications and visits. They’ve also beenbanned from prison jobsfor “security reasons”, denied books, newspapers, library and gym visits and subjected to “non-association orders”. In October,Muraisi was suddenly transferredfrom HMP Bronzefield, 18 miles from London, where her family lives, to New Hall prison in Yorkshire, which is too far away for her sick mother to visit. After she had been moved, she was told it was because of the risk of association with another prisoner on the same wing at Bronzefield.Yet none of the hunger strikers has been charged with, let alone sentenced for, terrorist offences. They have been charged with ordinary criminal offences, such as burglary, criminal damage and violent disorder. Muraisi and Ahmed are alleged to have broken into a factory run by Elbit Systems, Israel’s largest weapons manufacturer, and damaged equipment, while Chiaramello is alleged to have entered RAF Brize Norton during a protest in which Palestine Action sprayed warplanes with paint. These events took place before Palestine Action was proscribed as a terrorist group, ahighly controversial decisionthat is being challenged in court: the decision is expected very soon. But never mind the presumption of innocence, never mind the presumption against retrospective application of the law: because the CPS says there is a “terrorism connection”, they’re being treated as if they were convicted terrorists.On 26 December, a group of United Nations rapporteurs – the kind of people who, in days gone by, were heeded by governments –expressed grave concernabout the treatment of these prisoners, which, they said, included “reported delays in accessing medical care, use of excessive restraint during hospital treatment, denial of contact with family members and legal counsel, and lack of consistent independent medical oversight, particularly for detainees with serious pre-existing health conditions”. They had “serious questions” about our government’s compliance with international human rights law, “including obligations to protect life and prevent cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment”. But once you’ve labelled someone a terrorist, it seems, you can do almost anything to them and get away with it. The silence on this issue across almost all the media is something to behold.The government bears moral responsibility for these prisoners. Yet it appears to have no intention of exercising it. Lawyers, MPs and doctors have repeatedly beseeched ministers to engage with the issue.They flatly refuse, claiming that to do so would be to “create perverse incentives that would encourage more people to put themselves at risk through hunger strikes”. There is no evidence for this, and given the extremely unusual nature of this action (it is the biggestcoordinated, sustained hunger strikeby prisoners since the IRA’s in 1981), itseems highly unlikely.The government hassought to create the impressionthat such events are common – “over the last five years we have averaged over 200 hunger strike incidents every year” – so no unusual response is required. But what it appears to be referring to is brief refusals of food by individual prisoners, a completely different situation from animminent risk of death by starvation.More than 100 medical professionals signeda letterto the justice secretary, David Lammy, on 27 November warning that prisoners face a “medical emergency”, which “is being managed incorrectly”. Afurther letteron 17 December was signed by more than 800 medical and legal experts and others. The government has yet to respond to either.Instead, it appears to mock the hunger strikers’ predicament. When Jeremy Corbyn MPasked the justice minister Jake Richards, in parliament, whether he would meet their legal representatives to try to resolve the situation, Richards answered with a sharp “No”,prompting laughter in the chamber. In December, the speaker of the Commons remarked that Lammy’s failure to respond to the MPs asking for a meeting about the issue was “totally unacceptable”. But the failure continues.The hunger strikers’ demands seem reasonable to me: release on bail; the right to a fair trial (they claim the government has withheld key documents); lifting the ban on Palestine Action; and shutting down Elbit Systems – which has supplied weapons to a state engaged in genocide – in the UK. All these things, I believe, should be happening anyway. And they are of course negotiating positions. Whether all would need to be met for the strike to end cannot be known until the government engages. Its refusal to talk could condemn the strikers to death.It should not be necessary to risk your life to demand fair treatment and just decisions. But when everyone in power has stopped listening, there are few remaining options.George Monbiot is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Let it herald a new and exciting ambitionWed 7 Jan 2026 06.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 7 Jan 2026 12.31 ESTShareGood things may come to those who wait, but when it comes to repairing theBrexitsettlement Britain was left with by Boris Johnson, the waiting has come at a heavy cost. Prices are higher, trade is weaker and our influence diminished. That is why Keir Starmer’s promise to bring forward legislation this year to improve the UK’s deal with the EU is the clearest signal yet that the era of warm words without delivery may finally be coming to an end.Since the fanfare of lastMay’s UK-EU summit, progress has been glacial. The commitments trailed at the time were not abstract diplomatic wins but practical fixes people could feel. A deal on food standards and animal welfare, known as anSPS agreement, could ease pressure on supermarket prices. An energy trading agreement could lower bills by allowing the UK and EU to cooperate more efficiently in increasingly volatile markets. Yet months later, neither is in place.Much of the delay is not Downing Street’s fault. Negotiations require both sides to move, and the EU is not known for its haste. It must balance the interests of 27 member states and proceed carefully. But caution is no excuse for inertia, especially when the economic damage of the status quo is so clear.That is why reports that the government is preparing the legislative groundwork to deliver on SPS and energy cooperation are significant. Nearly three years after these proposals were first set out by the cross-partyUK Trade and Business Commission, this bill is the first concrete sign that implementation is finally within reach. Still, food and energy agreements alone will not be enough to define success at this year’s UK-EU summit.Britain’s return to Erasmus+in 2027 is welcome, but insufficient. Young people are still waiting for a youth experience scheme that would restore opportunities to live, work and study across Europe. More urgent still is the question of UK access toSafe, the EU’s €150bn rearmament fund. At a moment when brave Ukrainian men and women stand between us and the tyrant on our doorstep, and Donald Trump openly questions US commitment to European security, it is absurd that the UK and EU have yet to reach agreement on cooperating more closely on defence investment.Securing clear agreements and timelines on food, energy, youth mobility and defence cooperation would mark a successful end to what might be called phase one of Labour’s post-Brexit reset. But Starmer has hinted that he is thinking beyond that. In dismissing renewed calls for a customs union, he suggested that while helpful, it would not be transformative enough.The evidence backs him up. A customs union alone would deliver very modest gains while riling opponents. If Starmer is going to face down the inevitable accusations of Brexit betrayal, he should do so in pursuit of changes that genuinely move the dial on growth and living standards.That means phase two of the reset must focus on deeper, broader alignment across the economy. Mutual recognition of standards across all industrial sectors, mutual recognition of professional qualifications and UK accession to thepan-Euro-Mediterranean conventioncould boost GDP growth by about 2%, according toBest for Britain researchby Frontier Economics. These proposals are hardly radical. We’ve been pushing for them since 2023, and all sit comfortably within Labour’s stated red lines of no return to the single market, the customs union or freedom of movement.There is also a powerful regional case for this approach. Frontier’s analysis suggests that the biggest gains from closer UK-EU alignment on all goods and services would be felt outside London and the south-east, particularly in the Midlands, Yorkshire and the north-east. Whereas the Conservative government spoke in hollow terms about levelling up, this is an opportunity for the current government to deliver something real.Even larger GDP boons would of course come from breaching the red lines to pursue single market access, though leaving the UK a “rule taker”, and more still from joining the EU once again as a “rule maker”.Of course, any form of closer cooperation comes at a price. Like Switzerland, the UK would have to pay to participate and accept shared rules in agreed areas. This is a debate Starmer should welcome. When critics complain about cost, the PM can point to the reality of the past decade. Eurosceptics once railed against the UK’s annual EU membership contribution, yet Brexit has wiped about£90bn a year from the public finances, according to the House of Commons Library. Meanwhile, Trump’s embrace of tariffs has shown how isolation leaves Britain more exposed, not more independent.Some will argue that Brussels will never agree to such an arrangement with a large neighbouring economy. We have heard that refrain before. They’re the same voices that told us none of the measures now being prepared for in legislation were possible either. The truth is that the UK and EU share economic, security and geopolitical interests. Closer cooperation is not just possible, it’s an urgent necessity.Naomi Smith is CEO of Best for BritainExplore more on these topicsEuropean UnionOpinionBrexitForeign policyEuropecommentShareReuse this content"

Together with the national security strategy published in December, the move on Venezuela can be understood as advancing a vision for carving up the world into what the Nazi jurist Carl Schmitt called “great spaces”, with each in effect supervised by a great power (meaning, in today’s world, Washington, Moscow and Beijing). But more is happening than a return to such de facto imperialism: Trump’s promise to “run the country” for the sake of US oil companies signals the internationalization of one aspect of his regime – what has rightly been called the logic of the mafia state. That logic is even more obvious in his stateddesire to grab Greenland.The theory of themafia statewas first elaborated by the Hungarian sociologist Bálint Magyar in 2016. Such a state is less about corruption where envelopes change hands under the table. Instead, public procurement is rigged; large companies are brought under the control of regime-friendly oligarchs, who in turn acquire media to provide favorable coverage to the ruler. The beneficiaries are what Magyar calls the “extended political family” (which can include the ruler’s natural family). As with the mafia, unconditional loyalty is the price for being part of the system.As so often with Trump 2.0, practices that other regimes try to veil have been unashamedly in the open: the “pausing” of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act signaled that the US is not only open for business but also bribing (be it with a jet or a fake prize from Fifa); not only do pardons appear to be for sale; and not only can companies curry favor by financing a grotesque ballroom – but also the president’s political family, which includes billionaires like Steve Witkoff and HowardLutnick, seems poised to profit handsomely, including fromforeign deals, and now foreign military adventures; according to the investigative reporterJudd Legum, the Trump oligarch Paul Singer (owner of the oil company Citgo), is to set to dovery wellwith a Trump-controlled government in Caracas.This does not mean that the US’s “special military operation” in Venezuela is entirely a matter of “it’s the oil, stupid”; there is an argument that it helps push back against Iran, China and Russia (even if the precedent thatkilling 40 peopleand kidnapping sets alsolegitimizes interventionsby other powers, as those lamenting the weakening of international law have rightly pointed out). There is also the old-style neoconservative justification for removing a tyrant from power, something that the former self of Marco Rubio, before bending the knee, would have favored – though leaving a decapitated regime in place has made talk of democracy and human rights protection a tadimplausible. But the point is not regime change, as long as a regime is fine with Trumpian exploitation. The alternative is extortion: if the US oil companies get “total access”, the rulers ofwhat is also a mafia state of sortscan stay in place; if not, it’s a bigger boss talking to a minor boss along the lines of: “Nice country you have there; pity if we had to do a full-scale invasion.”What really gives the game away is the almost immediate follow-up chatter not just about Cuba, but about Greenland. Aboard Air Force One, Trump, Lutnick and Lindsey Graham had a good – in fact, obscene –laughabout the supposed inability of Denmark to provide security in the Arctic Circle; the joke that had the sycophants in stitches consisted of saying that Denmark was now providing one more dog sled for security (the reality is that Copenhagenrecently decided to send new naval vessels and surveillance drones– though an importantelite dog-sled patroldoes actually exist). In any case, the US has long had a base in Greenland and in many ways used the territory as it saw fit: despite a Danish policy against nuclear weapons, during the cold war, the US started flying nuclear-armed B-52s over Greenland, and they did so, it turned out, with the tacit consent of the Danish government (some footage of Dr Strangelove was filmed over Greenland). What Danish politicians are only slowly realizing is that the main issue isn’t national security, but the Trumpian euphemism of “economic security”.Greenland holds critical minerals; but it also provides a seemingly blank slate for the kinds of settler colonial fantasies that another set of Trump allies, the tech bros, have long been cultivating:charter cities, “network states” or even “seasteading”, based on a combination of libertarian ideology and limitless AI experiments. A company called Praxis – with funds from Peter Thiel – has been pursuing the idea of starting new countries with cryptocurrency; one of its founders, Dryden Brown,went on recordclaiming that “Praxis would like to support Greenland’s development by coordinating talent, companies, and capital to help secure the Arctic, extract critical resources, terraform the land with advanced technology to make it more habitable, and build a mythical city in the North”.Again, as with Latin America, there is a larger background story that matters: Pat Buchanan, the 1992 presidential candidate, already had his eyes on Greenland; plus, there is the fact that the current president is attracted to – how to put this politely – strong visuals; he once observed: “I love maps. And I always said: ‘Look at the size of this … That should be part of the United States.’” But the logic of extraction (if, necessary, preceded by extradition to a US court), exploitation and, if necessary, extortion is what most seems to be animating the quest for what one sycophant in Congress has claimed should be re-named “Red, White, and Blueland”.Jan-Werner Müller is a Guardian US columnist and a professor of politics at Princeton UniversityExplore more on these topicsTrump administrationOpinionDonald TrumpGreenlandDenmarkUS foreign policyEuropeUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

While he will no longer serve as president of the United States, his shadow over the future of American politics will continue to loom large across both sides of the aisle. Following Trump’s popular-vote victory in the 2024 election, the Democratic party has been forced to wrestle with what went wrong and how they can regain the support of an American majority to win back the White House. To win back Americans’ trust, Democrats have to prioritize affordability, broaden their cultural appeal, and reconnect with disaffected voters beyond their base.Trump’s political success has long been defined by his willingness to take on elite institutions and buck convention, putting distance between himself and weaknesses in the Republican brand while simultaneously undermining advantages in the Democratic brand. He’s ignored the wrath of editorial boards and economists while offering policy ideas and messaging that speaks to what voters think.In 2028,Democratsshould prioritize what voters – all of them – say they want over what’s pleasing to leftwing media, interest groups, donors and elites. Not only would this allow the Democratic party to put forward a policy agenda well-positioned to gain popular support – it would simultaneously help solve brand weaknesses, including criticisms that the party’s leaders lack strength, are too quick to dismiss voters’ concerns, or prioritize telling voters how to feel instead of listening to their concerns.Speaking of voters’ concerns – if the public has sent one unified message to our elected leaders over the last few years, it’s that the cost of living is unaffordable. The good news for Democrats is that Trump and the Republican party have failed to deliver on their promises to lower prices. Instead, they’ve coalesced behind an agenda that makes life less affordable for everyday Americans.The president’s tariffs are increasing prices of everyday goods, includinggroceries,clothing, andappliances. This pain is compounded by Trump’s marquee megabill, whichleaves many Americans worse offwhile giving the top 1% of earners $1tn in tax breaks. The bill’s unprecedented cuts to Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (Snap), termination of key tax credits, and massive increase in the federal debt will spike the costs of housing, healthcare, food, gas, and utilities for countless Americans.Democrats should go on the offense againstRepublicansworking to make life more expensive, but they should also lay out a vision for renewing the promise of a middle-class life and the political reforms that will be necessary to deliver on such change.As important as they are, popular and effective policies that address the American people’s problems aren’t a magic bullet for electoral success, especially whenmore than one-thirdof Americans identify as news avoiders. Of those who do consume news, 40% report being “primarily digital media consumers”, meaning they get their information from non-traditional sources, like podcasts, YouTube shows, and content creators.Reaching these Americans requires Democratic candidates to build an identity that extends beyond politics. That will necessitate tapping into the cultural conversations people are already having – not avoiding hard topics or creating an echo chamber to only talk to the Americans who already agree with you. Beyond the substance and need to penetrate the non-traditional media ecosystem, Democrats also need to optimize their owned social media channels for style to more authentically connect with the electorate. Publishingdirect-to-camera videos, for instance, have proven to be an effective tactic.If Democrats are willing to have conversations that breach their comfort zones and are willing to level with the public about how the party has fallen, they may find a sympathetic ear in those being devastated by the agenda Trump and Republicans in Congress have delivered on. And with Trump’s heir apparent – JD Vance, having cast the deciding vote for $1tn in cuts to Medicaid, cuts which he described as “immaterial” even as they will devastate rural hospitals and cause millions to lose coverage – running away from that record will prove impossible. It’s created a real opportunity for Democrats to make inroads in crucial swing states like North Carolina, wheremore than half a million peopleare poised to lose their health coverage, and Georgia, where the repeal of clean energy investments could costnearly 40,000 jobs, many in Republican districts.Democrats face a difficult, but achievable, task in winning back the White House in 2028. It will require them to be relentless in addressing America’s affordability crisis, reaching out beyond the Democratic base, and persuading voters that Republicans have failed to drive changes that materially improve their lives – and that Democrats have meaningful solutions and the strength to deliver on them.Colin Seeberger is a senior adviser for communications at the Center for American ProgressExplore more on these topicsDemocratsOpinionDonald TrumpTrump administrationRepublicansUS politicsJD VancecommentShareReuse this content"

Donald Trump knocked that plan off course. US intervention in Venezuela inevitably demanded the prime minister’s attention, as did this week’s summit of Ukraine’s allies, the “coalition of the willing”, in Paris. Progress towards agreeing security guarantees for Kyiv in the event of a peace deal with Russia was overshadowed by Mr Trump restating his ambition towrest control of Greenlandfrom Denmark. The dust had not settled when Americanspecial forces boardeda Russian-flagged oil tanker in European waters, ostensibly to enforce a blockade against Venezuela.Prime ministers have to multitask, but under these circumstances it is understandable if Sir Keir’s mind has been filled with foreign affairs. He should be used to this by now. Mr Trump’s return to the White House guaranteed that an already uncertain international climate would become increasingly volatile. Any hope that the incoming president’s rhetoric contained more bluster than intent was dashed when he announced his “liberation day” tariffs. He sees no value in America’s historic alliances. He despises institutions of multilateral governance. His actions may not be wholly predictable, but it is safe to assume he means what he says. He wants Greenland for America. Denmark and its Nato partners have to take the ambition seriously.TheMaga modelof transatlantic relations envisages a Europe of individual client states, preferably under far-right leadership, buying American goods, no longer aggregating their economic power in ways that can rival US global clout. Mr Trump’s visceral hostility to the EU puts Brexit Britain in a strategic bind: detached from the single market but still reliant on it for trade; dependent on the US for security but no longer confident that Washington is a dependably friendly capital. Sir Keir routinely denies that this poses any kind of dilemma. His policy is to pursue closereconomic ties with Europe, but stopping short of any steps that might interfere with parallel US-UK trade negotiations.In recent months, ministers have started speaking more plainly about the costs of Brexit and the duplicitous terms on which it was sold to voters in the referendum. The shift in tone follows widespread public recognition that leaving the EU imposed costs on Britain and brought scant reward. Downing Street has become more confident in making a pro-European argument, not least because Nigel Farage and other prominent Eurosceptics look squeamish when defending a pet project that conspicuously failed. But Downing Street also refuses to consider reintegration with the single market to any degree that would require restored free movement of labour. Thatred line, drawn for fear of provoking opposition to higher immigration, curtails the ambition and the potential economic value of Sir Keir’s programme.Those calculations demonstrate how completely foreign policy and domestic politics are intertwined. Sir Keir’s awkward balancing act between European solidarity and courtship of Mr Trump is not separate from his difficulty in articulating a compelling national story to compete with the radical rightwing, Maga-aligned rhetoric of Reform UK. It is the same struggle – a contest of values that demands unambiguous, principled leadership from the prime minister. It requires hard choices that Sir Keir is reluctant to acknowledge, and an assertion of Britain’s strategic interests inEuropethat he has been too slow to pursue.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

As a solar-powered “artificial friend”, bought as a companion and potential substitute for a sick teenage girl, Klara fulfils her duties with a loving loyalty that makes it impossible to think of her as a mere piece of tech.Brilliant, thought-provoking fiction. But back in the real world, anthropomorphising AI may not be such a clever idea. During the summer, Anthropic, a leading tech company,announcedthat in the interests of chatbot welfare, it was allowing its Claude Opus 4 model to avoid supposedly “distressing” conversations with users. More broadly, amid explosive growth in AI capacities, there is emergingspeculationover whether future Klaras may even deserve to be accorded legal rights like human beings.The premise of such discussions is both hypothetical and confused. In the synthetic text produced by large language models (LLMs), there is nothing resembling the human minds that created them in the first place. But discussion about the theoretical possibility of “sentient” AI also risks being a dangerous distraction.Interviewed last week by the Guardian, one of the leading AI pioneersnotedthat advanced models are already showing signs of tending towards self-preservation in experimental settings. According to Prof Yoshua Bengio, “We need to make sure we can rely on technical and societal guardrails to control them, including the ability to shut them down if needed.” Tendencies to anthropomorphise, he added, were not conducive to good decision-making in areas such as this.A sector that relies on shock and awe to drive a stock market boom will not care about that. This week in Las Vegas, Nvidia’s CEO, Jensen Huang,engagedin breathless public dialogue with two robots. Both cooed enthusiastically at Mr Huang’s plans for their enhanced future in an AI golden age to come.This kind of Silicon Valley showmanship might delight investors, and keep Nvidia’s market capitalisation ataboutthe $5tn mark. But it diverts attention from the serious job of protecting human freedoms and dignity from digital harm, and soberly working out what AI can safely and profitably deliver. The repulsivegenerationof fake sexualised images of women and underage girls by Elon Musk’s Grok offers yet another reminder of the urgency of that task.In such a context, avant garde talk about the future granting of “rights” to sentient AI seems somewhat beside the point. It is certainly true that as LLMs become more and more embedded in our everyday lives, there is sociological work to be done on how we interact with them.Evidenceof emotional attachments being formed with AIs is a new dimension of experience, and needs to be reflected upon. But it is important to remember that, other than as human creations, Siri and Alexa don’t exist.The opposite is the case, of course, when it comes to a girl driven to despair by algorithm-driven content on social media; or to Ukrainians subjected to thehorrorsunleashed by AI-enabled Russian drones. The digital revolution is undoubtedly transforming relationships between human beings and machines, for better and for worse. But toechothe title of a book by Friedrich Nietzsche – a philosopher muchadmiredby some of the tech avant garde – the new problems it has created are “human, all too human”, and should be understood as such.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Dromey dismisses the Green party’s support for a wealth tax as a “fantasy” policy. Yet this is a policy that eight in 10 Labour voters support. I have been campaigning for wealth taxes for years, and large numbers of Labour MPs now back such a measure.Dromey argues that a wealth tax could not fund all the investment we need in our communities. But that is not an argument against it, but to make it part of a wider package of reforms to tackle the deep inequality that scars our society. A wealth tax of 2% on assets over £10mcould raise £24bna year. Equalising capital gains tax rates with income tax and imposing a windfall tax on the super-profits of the banks could take that total closer to £50bn.This would not only provide vital resources to support people still hit hard by the cost of living crisis and to fund our public services. It would also send a clear signal that aLabourgovernment is prepared to act against our broken economic model.While a tiny elite get ever richer, the living standards of the vast majority have stagnated since the bankers crashed the economy over 15 years ago. With growth weak and unlikely to improve without structural change, Labour must grasp the nettle of redistribution.Dromey’s approach is also a political dead end. Labour is losing more voters to the Greens, and to those saying they will not vote, than it is to Reform. Losing those voters risks opening the door to Reform victories. Calling on the Labour leadership to reject popular social democratic policies is not only a moral mistake but an electoral one.Richard Burgon MPLabour, Leeds EastJoe Dromey makes several valid observations regarding the twin challenges facing the Labour party from the Green party and Reform. But I think he has to some extent missed the point. Relatively few Green voters believe that solving the intractable problems of the UK economy is as simple as taxing billionaires. Rather, this policy serves as a signpost to the Green priority of addressing wealth inequality, which has climbed to near-Victorian levels –the top fifth now own two-thirds of UK wealth. The Greens have policies to address this issue; Labour does not.More than that, what attracts younger voters like me to the Greens is Polanski’s positivity. He clearly believes we can be better, that UK voters deserve a better deal. Labour won a landslide majority in 2024 and immediately began doom-mongering about the dire state of the economy. Evidently, it believed it was 2010, when claims about empty coffers were de rigueur.It is not 2010, it is 2025, and after a decade and a half of relentless austerity and negativity, many voters are looking for a glimmer of hope. If the Fabian Society and the wider Labour party wish to head off the twin threats at their door, they’d do well to stir some up, instead of marching under a banner reading “Better things aren’t possible”.Adam OsborneBristolThere can be no greater proof of Zack Polanski’s successful cut-through than that the Fabian Society now sees the Green party as a threat. Alas for Labour, which has long provided reasons why some of its otherwise natural heartland continue to vote elsewhere.John GrayYorkHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

He said: “It’s been tough but now I finally did it. Now it’s just up to me and up to us to keep going like that.”When Ayden Heaven turned into his own goal,Burnleywere headed for a first win since 26 October. But Sesko stepped up to show whoever replaces Fletcher, who confirmed he will be in charge for the FA Cup tie with Brighton on Sunday, as the temporary man until the season ends, he may be about to catch fire – before Jaidon Anthony scored a memorable Burnley equaliser.Carrick running Solskjær close in race to become Manchester United’s interim managerRead moreOle Gunnar Solskjær is the slight favourite, ahead of Michael Carrick, and the sight of Shea Lacey hitting the bar should cheer whoever next takes the caretaker role, as will Kobbie Mainoo, another United starlet, entering as a late replacement.After the dour Ruben Amorim era the joke was whether Fletcher would belie a 25-year association with United by sending out the same dour three-man defence. He did not, of course – his configuration a 4‑2‑3‑1 that had the returning Bruno Fernandes as the 10 behind Sesko.The captain was the sole change – for Leny Yoro – from Amorim’s last game, the1-1 draw at Leedson Sunday, and after neat footwork in the buildup Fernandes saw Casemiro balloon over a first effort of Fletcher’s tenure.The Scot was assisted by his former United teammate Jonny Evans, who was regaled by the travelling support with his song that tells of the Northern Irishman’s “hate” for “scousers”. Thirteen minutes in and they were not keen at all on their team as Burnley scored via Heaven.Bashir Humphreys ran into space down the left and pinged the ball in, the centre-back stuck a leg out, and it ricocheted over Senne Lammens. Instantly, the camera panned left to an expressionless Fletcher, then to Omar Berrada and Jason Wilcox, the chief executive and director of football who sacked Amorim on Monday.View image in fullscreenBenjamin Sesko volleys United into a short-lived lead.Photograph: David Blunsden/Action Plus/ShutterstockThis was the first time Scott Parker’s men led since a 3-2 defeat at West Ham on 8 November. Why? Because United lacked imagination. Rare forays ended with Casemiro chipping into the Clarets’ area to no one, or Fernandes berating the stationary Sesko to dart in.Then, craft from United. Fernandes lifted a free-kick into the area, Casemiro headed across goal, and Matheus Cunha drew a Martin Dubravka save that went for a corner. From Luke Shaw’s delivery Lisandro Martínez bundled home but the centre-back was adjudged to have fouled Kyle Walker so the referee, Stuart Attwell, chalked it off.United were jittery, Burnley scented blood. Marcus Edwards ran through midfield and found Lucas Pires along the left and his shot evaded Lammens, barely missing the left corner.At this juncture, there was zero new manager bounce. Instead Fletcher, garbed in a dark blue winter coat, oversaw a passive side who needed to awaken. When Fernandes slipped Patrick Dorgu in the wide left forward lobbed Dubravka before Maxime Estève cleared off the line – better from United ahead of them wandering off for the interval.View image in fullscreenDarren Fletcher applauds the Manchester United fans after the draw at Burnley.Photograph: Phil Duncan/Every Second Media/ShutterstockFletcher followed David Moyes, Ryan Giggs, Louis van Gaal, José Mourinho, Solskjær (interim and permanent), Michael Carrick, Ralf Rangnick, Erik ten Hag, Ruud van Nistelrooy, and Amorim as the 13th appointment to the United hot seat since Sir Alex Ferguson left.Yet he now had only 45 minutes to turn the game around. At the start of this a progressive sequence began by Martínez that moved United from defence to attack and ended in a Dorgu attempt. The next move was lethal, as it featured Heaven and Casemiro and had Fernandes slipping in Sesko: the 22-year-old has struggled since joining in the summer, but a right-foot blast past Dubravka was emphatic.Brighton’s Kaoru Mitoma punishes Manchester City as title bid falters againRead moreThis had Fletcher joyous and urging his team for more. There was. At a Hannibal Mejbri corner United broke, the ball went left, and Sesko was again fed. This time a corner was claimed, which came to nothing, but soon Fernandes was hitting a post, his team discovering its rhythm.And, too, a surfeit of chances. Heaven, left free at Fernandes’s corner, headed wide before Sesko struck again, following Dorgu’s run and cross from the left, with a predatory, sweetly timed low volley.Sesko’s grin dazzled as much as Fletcher’s, United’s faithful gleeful behind the goal where the Slovenian scored. Yet the emotion became Burnley’s when Anthony, on as a substitute, turned away from Shaw and Martínez and beat Lammens with an 18-yard peach that flew in high.At point‑blank range Sesko fluffed a golden chance to snatch the winner and a hat-trick, before Lacey went close, the end result feeling fair on each team.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueBurnleyManchester Unitedmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

On the bright side, at least this was a crash course in the modernChelseafor Liam Rosenior.The new head coach saw poor defending undermine flashes of defiance, witnessed his erratic side collect their eighth red card of the season, and heard the away end at Craven Cottage spend much of the second half aim mutinous chants in the direction of Behdad Eghbali, the club’s co-controlling owner.Emery rages at Crystal Palace draw as Glasner extends record against Aston VillaRead moreThis was such an unserious effort from Chelsea. Calum McFarlane, the under-21s coach, was in charge. It was hard not to feel that Rosenior had made his first misstep. He has had a dizzying few days since leaving Strasbourg but it is worth thinking back to Thomas Tuchel taking over from Frank Lampard five years ago. Tuchel came up with a new system on his journey to London, had one training session before his first game and led Chelsea to Champions League glory four months later.Different times. Rosenior preferred to watch from the directors’ box and at least had a good view of the shambles unfold. Chelsea were down to 10 men after Marc Cucurella brought down Harry Wilson when theFulhamwinger was through on goal. The red mist descended, three players picking up bookings for dissent, and there was no containing the discontent from the travelling fans after Raúl Jiménez put Fulham ahead early in the second half.Supporters are not convinced by the project overseen by Eghbali and his fellow investors. Tension has grown since Enzo Maresca’s messy departure and it will not be easy for Rosenior to mend the damage. It begins for him with a trip to Charlton Athletic in the FA Cup on Saturday but the 41-year-old inherits a wounded team. Chelsea are down in eighth place after one win from their past nine league games and even find themselves level on points with Fulham, who made light of a lengthy list of absentees by earning a precious win thanks to a moment of impudence from Wilson in the 81st minute.Fulham were more streetwise. They have gambled on players who have been written off by other clubs. They are proof that experience matters. Jiménez, 34, has three goals in his past five games and is testament to Marco Silva’s ability to keep pushing this experienced group.View image in fullscreenLiam Rosenior (left) talks to the Chelsea co-owner Behdad Eghbali before kick-off against Fulham.Photograph: Mike Hewitt/Getty ImagesThis is a chance for Fulham. They are three points off the top four, although they will need to invest this month if they want to mount a push for European football. “It is nine years since my first game in this country,” Silva said. “I don’t remember many seasons like this, where the league is so tight. That shows the demands.”There is no hiding place at this level. Taking charge for the second and final time, McFarlane stuck to club policy and rotated heavily. Chelsea started well and should have led when Andrey Santos headed a corner against the bar.Santos did not make it to half‑time. The midfielder had to make way for Jorrel Hato after Cucurella’s dismissal. It came when Chelsea failed to reset after a corner. Bernd Leno, the Fulham goalkeeper, hit the ball long and Wilson sped through on goal before tangling Cucurella, whose foul on the edge of the area was a clear denial of an obvious goalscoring opportunity.McFarlane denied that the incident was evidence of a discipline problem. He will head back to the under-21s. They also played but it was uncomfortable when McFarlane asked for their result: it finished 6-2 to Benfica in thePremier LeagueInternational Cup.View image in fullscreenMarc Cucurella tangles with Fulham’s Harry Wilson resulting in a red card for the Chelsea player.Photograph: Justin Setterfield/Getty ImagesRosenior needs to give Chelsea direction. They escaped when Wilson had a goal disallowed for offside but they trailed in the 55th minute. Fulham had shifted from a back five, Kevin replacing Jorge Cuenca at half‑time, and they were ahead when Sander Berge crossed for Jiménez to head past Robert Sánchez after escaping Trevoh Chalobah.There was a response from Chelsea, who levelled when Antonee Robinson headed Pedro Neto’s corner against his own bar and Liam Delap converted the rebound. Yet it did not quell the mutiny. The chants towards Eghbali were constant and there was a banner calling for BlueCo, the consortium that owns Strasbourg and Chelsea, to sell up.It meant Eghbali was pumped when Delap scored. Fulham were undeterred. Silva regained the initiative with positive substitutions and the game was settled when Wilson danced round Hato before squeezing in his seventh goal of the season.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueFulhamChelseamatch reportsShareReuse this content"

City endureda third consecutive drawto leave the leaders Arsenal, who have a game in hand, five points ahead and currently without a title challenger.An Erling Haaland penalty gave City a platform they were unable to build on, failing to convert a plethora of chances in the second half. City let Brighton come back into the match and deservedly depart with a point thanks to Kaoru Mitoma.Antoine Semenyo’s parting gift gives Bournemouth victory over shaky SpursRead more“I love a lot, many, many good things but we didn’t score goals,” Guardiola said. “So many clear chances [missed], and it’s not just one player, two players, it’s all the people up front who played a lot. To score goals is part of your job.”Amid a hectic schedule and with absentees aplenty, a sluggish and rhythmless City struggled to threaten a well-disciplined Brighton defence prior to the break. There was often a line of eight yellow shirts on the edge of the box, forcing City to work hard to assess the few gaps. Set pieces looked a promising route with Max Alleyne miscuing a header at the front post and Bernardo Silva firing straight at Bart Verbruggen from corners.Injuries to Rúben Dias and Josko Gvardiol forced Alleyne to cut short a loan at Watford on Monday, and he was thrust into the starting lineup for a debut alongside Abdukodir Khusanov. The centre-backs acquitted themselves well against a progressive Brighton side, offering a positive on a difficult night.Brighton tried to punish City’s back four on the counterattack. Ferdi Kadioglu went through one‑on‑one, only to be repelled by Gianluigi Donnarumma, while Georginio Rutter was stopped at the last second thanks to the speed of Khusanov, who is not much more experienced than his partner Alleyne.View image in fullscreenErling Haaland gave Manchester City the lead but wasted a good late chance to win the game.Photograph: Adam Vaughan/EPAHaaland’s penalty was a rare highlight in a first half of struggle for City. Jérémy Doku, City’s most dangerous attacking threat won it because his feet were too quick for Diego Gómez, and the striker sent Verbruggen the wrong way to collect his 150th goal for the club. The spot-kick created a brief distraction from the volatile disagreement between Guardiola and Fabian Hürzeler on the touchline, earning the former a caution for complaining that it took the referee a look at the monitor before awarding it.If the opening 45 minutes were about Brighton’s defensive mentality, that was almost forgotten seconds after the break when a confused Yasin Ayari played the ball straight to Silva eight yards out. He shimmed and sent Verbruggen the wrong way but clipped the outside of a post when doubling the lead looked more likely, initiating a long list of failed conversions. It always felt like a second was needed for City but they could only muster six shots on target from 22 attempts. “We are not pleased how we gave away the chances, I think we did too many easy mistakes; too many mistakes where we invited them to score goals,” Hürzeler said.At the other end it was too simple for Mitoma, who was allowed space on the edge of the box and a simple route to cut inside, before finding the corner from 18 yards. “We all know that he can make the difference in the game, that he can be a gamechanger,” Hürzeler said of Mitoma. “He’s still not at 100%, but we need to push him to 100%.”Fulham’s Harry Wilson piles pain on 10-man Chelsea as Liam Rosenior watches onRead moreAntoine Semenyo will be a City player by the end of the week, providing energy, physicality, skill and ability to score important goals. It will be a boost with Savinho ruled out for up to two months – another option for Guardiola, who now also has a chance to prepare long-throw routines. That variety will give City’s opponents more food for thought.Once the equaliser went in, Brighton enjoyed a spell of dominance. They should have been ahead when Matheus Nunes missed a simple header; Mitoma capitalised and sent his cross for Gómez to tap home from a few yards out. The unmarked Paraguayan, however, conspired to send the ball behind him.Guardiola sent on the remainder of his senior substitutes to inject much-needed energy. The prospect of Rayan Cherki joining the main event brought an element of fear to Brighton but he fired over from promising position. Haaland had a header cleared off the line and should have done far better after another Ayari error, this time passing to Cherki inside the box. It was laid off to Haaland in space but he wasted the chance of victory.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueManchester CityBrighton & Hove Albionmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Sure enough Dominic Calvert-Lewin and Brenden Aaronson combined to befuddle Howe’s dozing defence. As Thiaw slipped, Aaronson met his centre-forward’s clever pass and unleashed a superlative low shot beyond Nick Pope’s reach.Newcastle equalised four minutes later. Thanks to Miley’s cross, Guimarães’s header, Anthony Gordon’s clever penalty area flick, Nick Woltemade’s subtle touch and an assured left-foot finish from the dangerous Barnes, parity was restored. But only temporarily. Leeds’s second goal came from the penalty spot following Thiaw’s handball. If, given that the German was toppling over at the time, the award of that spot-kick was contentious, it capped an unusually disappointing 45 minutes for the defender.Thiaw had struggled to subdue Calvert-Lewin and could not quite seem to fathom out Aaronson’s highly intelligent positional play as the No 10.View image in fullscreenDominic Calvert-Lewin puts away a Leeds penalty late in added time in the first half.Photograph: Alex Dodd/CameraSport/Getty ImagesDespite Gordon’s deliberate attempt to create a divot by scuffing up the turf around the penalty spot – an endeavour that led to his yellow card – Calvert-Lewin sent Pope the wrong way. It was his ninth goal of the season and eighth in the past nine games. A place in England’s World Cup squad surely beckons.Howe replaced Sven Botman with Thiaw at half-time. With Tonali, rather more controversially, also withdrawn, Tino Livramento came on at right‑back and Miley moved into midfield.Those changes looked vindicated as Joelinton swiftly headed Newcastle level. It was a top-drawer finish conjured when Miley performed minor wonders to keep the ball in play and Guimarães used the outside of his right foot to whip in a superb cross.The glorious craziness only intensified when Pope misread a cross and James Justin’s apparently goalbound header somehow ricocheted off the underside of the crossbar.View image in fullscreenJoelinton drags the scoreline back to 2-2 with an acrobatic header.Photograph: Stu Forster/Getty ImagesAs Schär crumpled in a challenge with Calvert-Lewin the mood darkened. Following several minutes of treatment he was carried off on a stretcher en route to hospital.Leeds promptly capitalised on Yoane Wissa’s slapdash pass and broke with alacrity, leaving Aaronson to expertly score his second goal.Then Aaronson was contentiously deemed to have handled Lewis Hall’s cross inside the area and Guimarães made no mistake from the penalty spot. “It was never a penalty but the referee was under great pressure from the crowd,” Farke said.The scene was then set for Barnes’s final, victorious 102nd-minute act. “It was such a heartbreaking moment,” the Leeds manager said.“It was a top game, a great game but, of course, there were mistakes. It became more like basketball. Both teams were out of control and just went for it.”Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueNewcastle UnitedLeeds Unitedmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

He can do that sometimes; drift in and out of games. When you possess the type of artistry Semenyo does, you can afford such periods of quiet absence.Then came the type of moment that has convinced Manchester City to shell out £65m for his services; the gamechanging ability that can win games and, perhaps, titles for Pep Guardiola’s side.Brighton’s Kaoru Mitoma punishes Manchester City as title bid falters againRead moreWhen it became clear that City was Semenyo’s most likely destination of choice this month,Bournemouthwere adamant their star player would remain on the south coast to face Tottenham before his anticipated departure. With his injury-time winner from the edge of the box, Semenyo showed precisely why. His wonderful strike ended a barren run of 11 winless games for Bournemouth and heaped further misery on a Tottenham side battling myriad problems.It was some way to round off a 26th birthday that also included a standing ovation from all corners of the Vitality Stadium and a farewell lap of his home for the past three years.As he meandered round the pitch after the match, a number of Spurs players remonstrated with some of their beleaguered away fans. The doubts over Thomas Frank grow ever more severe with each game his side fails to win. And there have been plenty of them – 10 of their past 12 in the league. To think, Tottenham even had designs on seeing if Semenyo fancied joining them this month.“He deserved this moment. A moment he will never forget,” said Andoni Iraola, who confirmed Semenyo would now be completing the “formalities” of his move to Manchester City. “It’s not easy to do what he has done. A lot of players would have acted differently. He has never found excuses. He was ready to give whatever we needed.

Richarlison hit a post and Micky van de Ven was awarded a penalty that was then overturned on viewing the pitchside monitor.Another defeat is a sucker punch for a club in an increasingly desperate position. Of further concern is an injury problem heading towards crisis proportions. To Dominic Solanke, James Maddison, Dejan Kulusevski and Mohammed Kudus – all of whom missed this match – Spurs also lost Lucas Bergvall and Rodrigo Bentancur to issues in the second half.“It’s very tough to sit here when we haven’t got anything out of an overall good performance,” Frank said. “The players gave everything. To sit here and concede in the five minutes of extra time is very painful, very tough. But that’s football.”Spurs’ manager also inadvertently landed himself in an embarrassing situation when he was photographed drinking out of an Arsenal‑branded cup, following Arsenal’s visit to the Vitality Stadium last weekend.View image in fullscreenJoão Palhinha thought he had secured a point for Spurs with his acrobatic overhead kick, but it was not to be.Photograph: Jeremy Landey/Focus Images Ltd/Shutterstock“I definitely did not notice it,” he said. “It’s fair to say not winning every single football match, it would be absolutely stupid of me to [intentionally] take an Arsenal cup.”The problems are mounting. Since the start of last season, only Wolves have endured morePremier Leaguedefeats than Tottenham’s 30, while their shots per game average under Frank is the lowest in the 25 years the statistics have been recorded.Explaining the exchange of some strong words between Spurs players and fans after the final whistle, Palhinha said: “It was just the supporters were sharing their frustrations. We, of course, understand. We respect them, first of all. I just said we are fighting for all the same. We want to win, not just the players – the staff and the supporters. We are trying to get the wins that, in my opinion, we deserve in the last games. I felt we were the best team on the pitch. It’s a punch in the stomach.”Defeat did seem cruel on the visitors.

Chivers, a League Cup and Uefa Cup winner with Spurs, won 24 caps from 1971 to 1973, scoring 13 goals.“It is with immense sadness that we announce the passing of our legendary former striker Martin Chivers,” Spurs said. “We extend our deepest sympathies to Martin’s family, friends and former teammates at this incredibly sad time. Our players will wear black armbands during this evening’s fixture against AFC Bournemouth. Rest in peace, Martin. One of the all-time greats.”Chivers started his career with his home-city club Southampton, making his debut in 1962, and joined Spurs in 1968.After a long, successful spell there he moved to Switzerland to play for Servette, where he won further honours, before returning toEnglandto play for clubs including Norwich and Brighton.Southampton said they were “deeply saddened” by the death of Chivers, who made 189 appearances for the club, scoring 108 goals. Hescored 174 times in 367 competitive games for Spurs, including both goals to beat Aston Villa in the 1971 League Cup final and two to help defeat Wolves in the two-leg 1972 Uefa Cup final.

During this difficult time the family are requesting privacy and will be making no further comment.”To describe Keegan’s playing career as successful is something of an understatement. After helping Liverpool to win three English league titles, while also lifting the European Cup, two Uefa Cups and the FA Cup, the man variously dubbed “King Kev” and “Mighty Mouse” won the Bundesliga with Hamburg.His individual talent was recognised by the collection of two Ballons d’Or as European footballer of the year in 1978 and 1979. He also won 63 England caps, scoring 21 goals during an international career that took him to the 1982 World Cup; he captained the national side 31 times.View image in fullscreenKevin Keegan photographed in January 2018.Photograph: Jon Super/The GuardianAfter a mini post-playing retirement largely spent playing golf in southern Spain, Keegan began the first of his two spells in charge of Newcastle in 1992. Having immediately paid for the fumigation of the club’s rundown training ground and swiftly secured promotion to the top flight, Keegan built a thrilling team on Tyneside.Known as “The Entertainers”, they topped the Premier League table for much of the 1995-96 Premier League season but eventually finished runners-up as Sir Alex Ferguson’s Manchester United overtook them in an extraordinary title race.A stint managing Fulham followed his resignation from Newcastle in January 1997 before Keegan succeeded Glenn Hoddle as England manager from 1999 until his resignation in 2000.It would prove a difficult interlude epitomised by some disappointing performances at the 2000 European Championship.

In 2009 an independent Premier League arbitration tribunal upheld his case for constructive dismissal from St James’ Park and awarded Keegan £2m in damages.Explore more on these topicsNewcastle UnitedEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

The Enhanced Games allows the use of performance-enhancing substances and permits athletes to take substances approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA), under strict supervision.Global anti-doping chief admits drugs cheats in sport are escaping detectionRead moreIn a statement, the former Olympic long-distance runner Buckner said: “As a former athlete, I find this particularly appalling. Those of us who have competed know what it takes to succeed the right way – through talent, dedication, and respect for the rules. To see a British athlete aligning themselves with an event that celebrates the use of performance-enhancing drugs is profoundly disappointing.”In September 2025, the Olympic silver swimming medallistBen Proud announced that he would be participatingin the event, making him the first British athlete to join.Prescod won a silver medal at the 2018 European championships and competed at Tokyo 2020 before announcing his retirement in August last year.The statement from UK Athletics added: “UK Athletics is disappointed by reports that former Great Britain sprinter Reece Prescod intends to take part in the so-called Enhanced Games.“UKA does not recognise the Enhanced Games as a legitimate sporting competition. Any event that promotes or permits the use of harmful substances with the aim of pushing the human body to its limit for short-term goals is not sport as we value it.“This concept fundamentally undermines the integrity of competition, places athletes’ health and welfare at serious risk, and is incompatible with the principles of clean sport that underpin athletics in the UK and worldwide. The very reason clean sport exists is because those involved saw the risks that resulted from athletes taking substances that led to severe life changing harms.“Over the years British athletes have experienced the devastating impact of doping, through losing the opportunities afforded from winning major medals, receiving recognition only years later, or by having medals removed, so it is disappointing to see a former team member demonstrate disregard in this manner.“UKA’s Clean Athletics Policy is clear: doping and the use of prohibited substances or methods will not be tolerated. While Reece Prescod is no longer part of the UKA performance system, his decision to associate with an event that directly contravenes both our policy and the World Anti-Doping Code is unacceptable.”Explore more on these topicsAthleticsDrugs in sportnewsShareReuse this content"

The US energy secretary, Chris Wright, said the US would take payment for the oil and use the proceeds “to benefit the Venezuelan people”.Trump claims Venezuela is set for an oil boom after US attack – history points to a bumpy road aheadRead more“We’re going to market the crude coming out of Venezuela,” Wright said. “First this backed-up store of oil, and then indefinitely going forward we will sell the production that comes out of Venezuela in the marketplace.”Wright set out the plans for long-term control of Venezuela’s oil industry as the US seized a Russian-flagged oil tanker that had been on course to travel to Venezuela from Iran before it turned back towards the Atlantic.The vessel, the Marinera,previously known as the Bella 1, is understood to be part of ashadow fleetmoving oil for Russia, Iran and Venezuela, and the high-stakes operation is likely to risk confrontation with the Kremlin after Moscow reportedly dispatched a submarine to safeguard the vessel.A second tanker, the Sophia, was later seized in the Caribbean. The US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, said Venezuela’s interim leaders had asked for the oil cargo seized on the ship to be “part of this deal”.“They want the oil that was seized on one of those ships to be part of the deal. They understand that the only way they can move oil and generate revenue and not have economic collapse is if they work with the United States,” he said.Late on Wednesday, the US vice president, JD Vance, told Fox News’ Jesse Watters Primetime show that Venezuela could only sell its oil if it served US interests.He said: “We control the energy resources, and we tell the regime you’re allowed to sell the oil so long as you serve America’s national interest, you’re not allowed to sell it if you can’t serve America’s national interest.”A continuing supply of crude from Venezuela could act as a drag on oil prices, which last year recorded theirsteepest annual fallsince the Covid pandemic and could plummet further as oil producers continue to pump more than is needed by the global economy.Global oil prices fell on Wednesday, although they recovered some ground in morning trading in New York. The international benchmark, Brent crude, fell to just over $60 a barrel on Wednesday, while the US oil price was down by 0.5%, at $60.39 a barrel, after falling below $56 earlier.The oil grab also raises the prospect of disruption to Venezuela’s oil exports to China, which takes about 80% of its crude exports, potentially forcing Beijing to pay higher prices for its crude and increasing tensions with the White House.China’s foreign ministry said on Wednesday that Venezuela “enjoys full and permanent sovereignty over its natural resources and economic activities”, and US demands for the country to hand over its oil “violate international law, infringe upon Venezuela’s sovereignty, and harm the rights of the Venezuelan people”.In a post on his Truth Social platform late on Tuesday,Donald Trumpsaid: “That money will be controlled by me, as President … It will be taken by storage ships, and brought directly to unloading docks in the United States.”Oil graphicTrump has said he wants Venezuela’s interim president, Delcy Rodríguez, to give the US and private companies “total access” to Venezuela’s oil industry. He said Wright was in charge of executing the deal, adding that the oil would be taken from ships and sent directly to US ports.Wright told a Goldman Sachs energy conference in Miami on Wednesday: “If we control the flow of oil and the flow of the cash that comes from those sales, we have large leverage. We need … control of those oil sales to drive the changes that simply must happen.”The state oil company Petróleos de Venezuela SA (PDVSA), which under a decree issued during Hugo Chávez’s presidency holds at least a 51% stake and operational control over all exploration fields, released a statement saying it was “moving forward with negotiations for the sale of crude volumes to the US”.In the statement, shared across the regime’s official Telegram channels, PDVSA said the “process is being carried out under schemes similar to those in place with international companies such as Chevron”. Even before last Saturday’s strike, the US company already held about 25% of operations in Venezuela, with PDVSA controlling 50%, about 20% split between joint ventures with China and Russia, and 5% held by European companies.PDVSA said the talks with the US were “based on a strictly commercial transaction, guided by criteria of legality, transparency and mutual benefit”, and it reiterated “its commitment to building partnerships that drive national development in favour of the Venezuelan people and contribute to global energy stability”.After Saturday morning’s attack on Caracas led to thecapture of Nicolás Maduro, Trump vowed that US companies wouldreignite Venezuela’s struggling oil industry.US oil executives from Chevron, ConocoPhillips and ExxonMobil are expected to meet Trump at the White House on Friday to discuss plans to pour billions of dollars into the industry in Venezuela.Chevron is the only US oil company that still operates in the country, after the assets of ConocoPhillips and Exxon were nationalised by the former president Hugo Chávez in the mid-2000s, a move Trump has described as “the greatest theft in the history of America”.The US oil majors have so fardeclined to outline publiclyany such plans for investment and there is scepticism that big listed companies would be willing to invest in a politically unstable region amid falling global oil prices without iron-clad guarantees that their investments would be protected.There is also scepticism over whether Venezuela, which holds the world’s largest reserves of crude, could once again produce meaningful amounts after years of neglect and corruption that caused its output to fall from highs of 3.5m barrels of oil a day 25 years ago to about 1m bpd – or less than 1% of the global market.The multibillion-dollar investment needed to increase Venezuela’s oil production to the levels of its heyday in the late 1990s could require 15 years of work to repair the country’s degraded infrastructure and capital spending of up to $185bn, according to analysis by Rystad Energy, a global consultancy.The US Department of State was approached for comment.Explore more on these topicsOilDonald TrumpVenezuelaAmericasCommoditiesTrump administrationOil and gas companiesnewsShareReuse this content"

Most of the schools are in the south of England and charge fees upwards of £25,000 a year.Leading universities urged to take no more than 10% of students from private schoolsRead moreIn a memo outlining the policy, Marcus Tomalin, Trinity Hall’s director of admissions, claimed “the best students from such schools arrive at Cambridge with expertise and interests that align well with the intellectual demands” of the subjects.Tomalin added: “To ignore or marginalise this pool of applicants would risk overlooking potential offer holders who are not only exceptionally well qualified but who have been encouraged to engage critically and independently with their subjects in a way that Cambridge has historically prized.“It is important that the crucial task of securing greater fairness in admissions does not unintentionally result in reverse discrimination.”Trinity Hall staff who spoke to the Guardian said a “significant number” of fellows were upset by the new policy but had been powerless to stop it last month when it was formally presented to the governing body.One said: “This is a deeply alarming policy. Claiming that the best students come from an elite set of schools will make many of our wonderful diverse community feel unwelcome and risks returning Trinity Hall to the boys’ club culture of the past.”Another said it was a “slap in the face” for state-educated undergraduates and for those staff within Cambridge who had fought to widen participation and improve outreach to British state schools.Lee Elliot Major, a professor of social mobility at the University of Exeter, said: “What is truly shocking is the implication that widening participation students are academically inferior. The evidence is clear: when talented students who have faced greater barriers gain access to elite universities, they flourish precisely because opportunity, not ability, was the binding constraint.“At a time when the educational playing field is more unequal than ever, universities should be identifying academic potential wherever it exists, not mistaking polished performance, so often shaped by privilege, for greater raw talent.”A spokesperson for Trinity Hall said the college “has a commitment to admit the best and brightest students regardless of background and has a strong record of access initiatives aimed at students from disadvantaged backgrounds”.Noting schemes including a residential programme for those from underrepresented ethnic minority groups, they said: “This latest initiative is aimed at targeted subjects to encourage students with high academic potential to apply to Cambridge. Those students come from all school types, including the independent sector, in line with the university’s access and participation plan.”Privately educated still have ‘vice-like grip’ on most powerful UK jobsRead moreTomalin’s memo said that while much of the university’s focus had “quite rightly” been on underrepresented and disadvantaged groups, “many” privately educated applicants “have faced considerable personal or financial challenges”, and it claimed that a “significant minority of students at leading independent schools are on full bursaries”.However a recentsurvey of 200 wealthy independent schoolssuggested only 6% of fee income was spent on means-tested bursaries – of which a fraction would be likely to be full bursaries.Cambridge and Oxford have made great efforts to shed a reputation for admitting students from a narrow pool of elite schools, particularly fee-paying institutions and highly selective grammar schools.By 2022, nearly 73% of UK students admitted to Cambridge were state educated. But the proportion has since fallen to 71%, with 29% coming from private schools. About 7% of UK-educated students attend private schools.In 2024, Cambridge removed specific targets for state schools admissions, under a policy imposed by the Office forStudents, England’s higher education regulator.Trinity Hall’s proportion of privately educated students was 32% in 2022, falling to 26% in its most recent data.Trinity Hall is one of Cambridge’s oldest colleges. Founded in 1350, its alumni include Stephen Hawking, JB Priestley and Donald Maclean, who wasrecruited as a Soviet double agentwhile at Cambridge.Explore more on these topicsUniversity of CambridgeOxbridge and elitismPrivate schoolsAdmissionsAccess to universitySocial mobilityStudentsnewsShareReuse this content"

It is understood the committee took the decision at a meeting on Wednesday. It will keep its X account, which has about 27,000 followers, in existence but dormant, to ensure no one else can take it over.While the decision concerns only the committee’s account, some individual members, including Owen, have already stopped using X. Another, the Liberal Democrat MP Christine Jardine, said she was leaving the platform, calling the images generated by Grok “the last straw”.Jardine said she had taken the view that X was a good way to communicate with constituents. “But I cannot in all conscience continue to use a platform which seems unwilling to act against this grossly offensive and abusive online behaviour towards women and girls,” she said.Owen also plans to write to the Cabinet Office and to Ofcom to urge action against X. She said: “I personally came off X in 2024 after the platform and its owner promoted and paid creators of far-right racist and misogynistic material. The committee heard at the end of last year on inquiries about community cohesion that X posts regularly break UK law on hate speech.“In recent days, X and xAI have allowed the creation and sharing of AI deepfakes, non-consensual intimate imagery, and child sexual abuse material – all areas identified as online violence against women and girls by our committee.“We do not view it as appropriate to use such a platform to share our work. I hope that the government, Ofcom and relevant law enforcement agencies work quickly to make X immediately abide by UK law on online safety and non-consensual intimate image abuse, to be held to account for its failures and if it refuses to abide by our laws, it must be appropriately sanctioned.”On Monday, Ofcom said it was aware of serious concerns raised about Grok creating images of undressed people and sexualised images of children. It said it had contacted X and xAI “to understand what steps they have taken to comply with their legal duties to protect users in the UK” and would assess the need for an investigation based on the company’s response.Starmer’s spokesperson said: “What we have seen on Grok is a disgrace. It is completely unacceptable. No one should have to go through the ordeal of deepfakes of themselves online, and we won’t allow the proliferation of these demeaning images.“X needs to deal with this urgently, and Ofcom has our full backing to take enforcement action wherever firms are failing to protect UK users. It already has the power to issue fines of up to billions of pounds and even stop access to a site that is violating the law. And when it comes to keeping people safe online, all options remain on the table.”Asked about the issue, Kemi Badenoch’s spokesperson said the Conservative leader agreed with the government: “We both find it absolutely abhorrent and want to see it clamped down upon as soon as possible.”Asked if this could mean Badenoch, an enthusiastic user of X who has 350,000 followers, might leave the platform, the spokesperson said: “We are very clear that what is happening with those Grok deepfakes is absolutely disgusting and there has to be some something done to stop that. I’m not about to announce policy here.”Earlier on Wednesday, Nigel Farage was asked if he was happy to earn money from a site that had a business model based in part on child sexual abuse material. The Reform UK leader is paid for engagement on the site as a much-followed verified user.Farage avoided the question but said he was “very worried” about the images and he believed X would listen to the criticism.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

The common agricultural policy payments and their successors have often been what has kept farms profitable during inflationary pressures and extreme weather events such as floods and droughts.The money for the SFI is limited, meaning that when enough applications for it come in, the scheme is closed. Farmerswere outragedwhen the scheme was abruptly shut in March last year and it later emerged that 3,000 farms had been wrongly blocked from applying after themoney ran out.Reynolds is expected to say in her speech: “Farmers are at the heart of our national life – for what you produce, the communities you sustain, and the landscapes and heritage you protect.“We will work with you – through our new Farming and Food Partnership Board, through peer-to-peer networks, through community-led change, and through engagement on the detailed changes to SFI.“You will have the certainty you need to plan – clear budgets, clear timelines, clear future roadmap, and growth built on strong foundations.”Defra has been making the case to the Treasury that the nature schemes are good value for money, and not subsidising rich landowners, in order to keep the budget untouched during difficult economic times. During the spending review last year, the budget wasslashed by £100m.The Guardianrevealed last yearthat ministers were looking at how the dwindling funding pot could be reserved for those farms which are less profitable, with plans to cut richer farms from the scheme.The Country Land and Business Association president, Gavin Lane, said: “It is essential that all farmers can access the Sustainable Farming Incentive scheme as soon as possible, regardless of farm type or size, to deliver the greatest benefits to the environment.”Martin Lines, the chief executive of the Nature Friendly Farming Network, said: “It’s good to finally have some clarity, even if June still feels a long way off. We particularly welcome the commitment to prioritise smaller farms. Too often in the past, England’s agri-environment schemes have been a race to be first over the line, favouring those with the time and money to navigate complex applications. Many smaller, highly active farms are working flat out and simply don’t have the capacity to play that game.“We’ve long advocated for a reward system that properly reflects the real public value delivered by smaller production systems. It’s encouraging to see government recognising the role of small farms in supporting social cohesion, keeping people on the land, and ensuring public money for public goods genuinely rewards those systems.”Explore more on these topicsFarmingnewsShareReuse this content"

They believe their study, which analysed more than 27m commercial flights out of approximately 35m in 2023, is the first to assess the variation in operational efficiency of flights across the globe.The amount of carbon dioxide per kilometre flown has been falling as aircraft become gradually more fuel efficient. However, the growth in the number of flights has far outstripped this, meaning the emissions helping to fuel the climate crisis are rising. Aviation’s carbon dioxide emissions could double or eventriple by 2050, according to experts.The new analysis found that more polluting flights were common from airports in the US and Australia, particularly smaller ones, as well as in parts of Africa and the Middle East. Airports in India, Brazil and south-east Asia were dominated by less polluting flights.Atlanta and New York were among the airports with the least efficient flights overall, almost 50% worse than the airports running the most efficient flights, such as Abu Dhabi and Madrid.map chartThe UN aviation body, the International Civil Aviation Organization, is relying onan “unambitious and problematic”offsetting scheme, called Corsia, to cut emissions. But it has yet to require any airline to use a carbon credit. The ICAO was recently accused of having beencaptured by the industry. The EU has set a 2030 target for airlines to use 6% sustainable aviation fuel, made from waste cooking oil or produced using electricity, but the supply of these fuels is limited and expensive.“We are currently stuck with a global situation where there is no hope that aviation will reduce its emissions,” said Prof Stefan Gössling, at Linnaeus University in Sweden and who led the research. In contrast, he said all-economy-seat planes, 95% flight occupancy and using today’s most efficient aircraft could cut fuel use and therefore emissions by 50-75%. “That is huge,” he said, adding that it would also mean far less sustainable fuel would be needed to make flying near emissions free in the future.“I always thought air transport was already very efficient, and that is also what airlines like to tell people,” Gössling said. “But, in reality, it’s very inefficient because of the three factors: using old aircraft, transporting people [in premium seats] with lots of space, and often having aircraft that are not really fully loaded.” In 2023, the average “load factor” – seat occupancy – was almost 80%.The study,published in the journal Communications Earth & Environment, examined the efficiency of flights between 26,000 pairs of cities, based on the CO2emitted per kilometre per passenger. The analysis involved 3.5 billion passengers who flew a combined distance of 6.8tn km, equivalent to 145 return journeys to the sun. The flights caused 577m tonnes of CO2emissions, equivalent to the annual emissions of Germany.The research found that the US, which is responsible for a quarter of all aviation emissions, had flights that were 14% more polluting than the global average. China, the second biggest aviation polluter, had flight efficiencies slightly above the global average, while the UK, the world’s third biggest aviation polluter, had efficiencies slightly below the average of 84.4g of CO2per passenger kilometre.The emissions on specific routes varied enormously. The most efficient route was from Milan, Italy, to Incheon airport near Seoul, South Korea (31.6g CO2/pkm). Modern, full planes with fewer premium seats are largely the reason for more efficient flights. The least efficient route was in Papua New Guinea, with the second worst from Ironwood airport to Minneapolis/St Paul in the US (805g CO2/pkm).“While airlines often claim that fuel savings are in their own economic interest, the reality is that many airlines continue to fly with old aircraft, low load factors, or growing shares of premium-class seating,” the researchers said.Gössling said replacing premium seats with denser economy seating was probably the most important factor. Overall, first and business class passengers are responsible for more than three times the emissions of economy passengers, he said, and up to 13 times more in the most spacious premium cabins.Policies to implement greater efficiency could include softer options, such as requiring airlines to disclose an efficiency rating for each route, Gössling said: “Just as with white appliances, you wouldn’t want to fly with an airline that is rated F.”Market-based policies could involve airports charging higher landing fees for more polluting aircraft, which also worsen the air quality of local communities, he said. Finally, regulation could ban the most polluting aircraft, as has already happened in places for the noisiest planes.The potential improvements in efficiency set out in the study, such as replacing older, more polluting planes, would involve costs, and the aviation industry already runs on low profit margins. But Gössling argued the aviation industry had got stuck in a business model that focuses on growing passenger numbers to increase profit.Instead, he said, it could run fewer, fuller flights with higher ticket prices. He said many flights were only taken because they were so cheap: “We know that a lot of air transport demand is induced. If you increase the cost, people would just choose a different type of holiday.”Marie Owens Thomsen, the senior vice-president of sustainability at the International Air Transport Association, the trade association for the world’s airlines, said: “Airlines have a strong self-interest to reduce fuel burn and maximise load factors. However, supply-chain failures have caused an aircraft order backlog of over 5,000 planes.” She said real progress in cutting aviation emissions lay in deploying SAF, Corsia, and modernising air routes.Globally, flying is dominated by rich passengers, with just 1% of the world’s populationresponsible for 50% of aviation emissions. Only about 10% of people fly at all each year and only 4% fly abroad. Even in richer nations such as the US and Germany, only about a half and a third of people respectively take flights.A spokesperson for the ICAO said its analysis determined that operational improvements could deliver 4-11% of the carbon emission reductions needed to reach net zero, with cleaner fuel delivering over half, and innovative technologies the rest. The ICAO is encouraging accelerated action by its 193 member states, he said, and welcomed all research providing new insights.Explore more on these topicsAirline emissionsClimate crisisPollutionAirline industryAir transportShareReuse this content"

Photographs byHugh Kinsella CunninghamWed 7 Jan 2026 01.00 ESTShareThe older inhabitants of Kinshasa can remember when trees shaded its main avenues and thick-trunked baobabs stood in front of government offices.Jean Mangalibi, 60, from his plant nursery tucked among grey tower blocks, says the capital of the Democratic Republic of the Congo’s frenzied expansion has all but erased its greenery. “We’re destroying the city,” he says, over the sound of drilling from a nearby building site.View image in fullscreenGardener Jean Mangalibi believes the city has a responsibility to protect the baobab tree and has become a strong advocate for its preservation.The number of trees lost in and around this vast city, the third largest inAfrica, has made it all the more urgent for environmentalists to campaign to protect one of its last – and most notable. A single century-old baobab tree remains standing in the historic centre of Kinshasa – in the commune of Gombe – but it too is now under threat. Mangalibi and like-minded activists are rallying to save the symbol of the city’s past from developers.“It’s part of the soul of Kinshasa,” he says. “We have a responsibility to protect it.”Kinshasa, with an estimatedpopulation of 17.8 million people, half of themaged under 22, was mostly built in the first half of the 20th century, during themurderous reign of the Belgian colonialists, as a planned modernist capital, strategically sited on the Congo River.View image in fullscreenAn aerial view of Kinshasa’s Limete district of the city of Kinshasa shows the spread of the rapidly-expanding city.But breakneck growth and nonexistent urban planning have created one of the world’s fastest-growing – and notoriously polluted – megacities. Flooding regularly claims dozens of lives and sends waves of plastic waste through poor neighbourhoods.The baobab stands on a plot of land next to the main ferry port, owned by the DRC’s state-owned transport company, Onatra. Until last year, a popular fabric market was centred on the old tree.But the site is now closed off and the first signs of building work are visible. Activists and local government officials accuse Onatra of selling the land to a private developer. It is not clear who is involved, and Onatra did not respond to the Guardian’s questions.View image in fullscreenBaobabs have great practical and symbolic value as a source of food and as traditional places for speeches and meetings.In August, diggers arrived at the site, prompting Mangalibi and other activists to turn up and block the construction work, saving the tree just in time, says Sifa Kitenge, a fabric trader who worked under the baobab. “They were ready to cut it down,” adds the 70-year-old, calling the baobab “an important symbol”.From an ancestral point of view, you don’t cut down baobabsMalicka Mukubu, DRC National Tourism OfficeThe tree remains standing for now, but the construction work has not been abandoned, raising fears for its future.Kinshasa’s last baobab carries rich symbolic meaning, as do baobabs across Africa. The majestic trees have great value as a source of food in their fruit and leaves – and as symbolic places for meetings and speeches. With their stature and great age, they represent a link to the past too.View image in fullscreenSir Henry Morton Stanley is reputed to have negotiated for land under a baobab in the 1870s, marking the beginning of the settlement that would become Kinshasa.Illustration: PHAS/Universal Images Group/Getty ImagesLocal tradition holds that British-American explorer Sir Henry Morton Stanley negotiated land from traditional chiefs under a baobab in the 1870s, marking the beginning of the colonial settlement in Kinshasa.“It’s a continuation of history,” says Mangalibi, who adds this baobab is more than a century old, and was planted to commemorate the building of the ferry port.Such commemoration trees were once common, but disappeared along with other greenery as the city grew.View image in fullscreenTrees have disappeared from Kinshasa ato accommodate building but also to supply the need for fuel.In 2010, the city authorities chopped down hundreds of leafy terminalia trees that lined Kinshasa’s main artery, the eight-lane Boulevard du 30 Juin. Officials promised to replant them, but the boulevard remains bare to this day.Francis Lelo Nzusi, a geographer at the University of Kinshasa, blames a lack of planning, but also on the constant need for fuel. Only41% of people in Kinshasahave electricity, meaning millions rely on charcoal for cooking – trees chopped down for charcoal are rarely replanted.“Everything has been cut down,” says Nzusi. Planned green spaces also quickly become fly-tips, he adds, since there is no proper waste-management system.Demographic pressure in Kinshasa is intense – the populationgrows by about 730,000 peoplea year. Much of the endless city sprawl consists of cramped concrete houses clustered along unpaved, flood-prone alleys. Larger roads are clogged with traffic and impromptu markets.‘In 10 years, we might not have forests’: DRC struggles to halt charcoal trade – a photo essayRead moreAgainst this background, Jean Mangalibi has started a pressure group with other activists, calledAutour du Baobab, or Around the Baobab. The group is focused on saving the last baobab through lobbying and public events, but the activists also plan to tackle other environmental issues.View image in fullscreenMangalibi’s plant nursery, pictured, has been ransacked several times because of his activism.“It’s work that carries a lot of risk,” says Mangalibi, whose nursery has been ransacked several times due to his activism.This time, however, he has some government officials on his side. Malicka Mukubu, the head of the DRC’s National Tourism Office, said the baobab must be saved because it represents the strength of Congolese culture. “From an ancestral point of view, you don’t cut down baobabs,” says Mukubu. But the challenge is steep, she admits, not least because most public officials are indifferent.Explore more on these topicsGlobal developmentCities and developmentTrees and forestsDemocratic Republic of the CongoAfricaMegacitiesUrbanisationfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Police said no one was injured in that incident.A Met Office yellow warning for snow and ice has been extended to midday on Thursday forScotlandand the north of England before Storm Goretti is expected to bring heavy snow later in the week.About 400 homes in the north of Scotland had their power restored after morning outages, as the region struggled with heavy snow that has cut off many rural areas, disrupted travel and seen hundreds of schools remain closed.After Aberdeenshire council declared a major incident on Tuesday, the severe weather had abated by the end of Wednesday, allowing recovery efforts to begin in earnest.The Scottish government said on Wednesday evening that across the transport network, road clearance work was progressing well. Scotland’s trunk road network is open, while most local roads are passable with care. All rail routes are now open, except for the Far North between Invergordon and Wick or Thurso, which is expected to open later today. All Highland and Islands airports are also open with no issues reported and ferry services are operating normally.More than 400 schools across Aberdeenshire, Moray, Orkney and Shetland were closed for a third day, while pupils in the Highlands had an extra day off, having been due to return from holiday on Wednesday, with a yellow warning for snow and ice in place all day in northern Scotland and people there told to expect a further 5-10cm of snow.Temperatures are forecast to drop to as low as -6C in parts of rural Scotland and to just below freezing more widely overnight, the Met Office said.Meanwhile, the rest of the UK is braced for further stormy weather with the Met Office chief forecaster, Neil Armstrong, describing Storm Goretti as a “multi-hazard event”, bringing heavy rain, strong winds and snow from Thursday.Armstrong said 5-10cm of snow was likely inWalesand the Midlands, with 15-25cm in some places, and a potential for up to 30cm locally.Strong winds with gusts of 50-60mph will likely affect south-western areas on Thursday afternoon and evening, with gusts of 60-70mph along exposed hills and coasts, the Met Office said.A yellow snow warning has been issued for a large part ofEnglandand much of Wales, and will be in place from 6pm on Thursday until midday on Friday.The Met Office has also issued an amber warning for heavy snow from Thursday evening into Friday, covering parts of Wales, the Midlands and South Yorkshire.Forecasters said that Goretti could mean delays or cancellations to trains and planes, rural communities may be cut off, and power cuts or disruption to mobile signal also likely.The warning, which comes into force at 8pm on Thursday and ends at 9am on Friday, stretches from Sheffield in the north, down to Leicester, and across much of the West Midlands and into Wales.An amber wind warning from 5pm to 11pm on Thursday has also been issued across parts of Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly, as forecasters warn of 80-90 mph gusts in “exposed places”.A yellow rain warning has been issued across the east of England from 6pm on Thursday to 9pm on Friday, and west Wales from midday on Thursday to 10am on Friday.View image in fullscreenA snowplough clears the A944 in Alford, Scotland.

It said the production had been a year in the making but has not revealed a broadcast date.Channel 5 said the show will document the newsreader’s “double life as it spirals out of control, leading him to make the greatest announcement of his career – his total exit from public life following his conviction for serious child sexual offences”.Edwards’s spectacular fall from grace was completed in September 2024, when he washanded a six-month suspended prison sentencefor accessing indecent photographs of children as young as seven.He pleaded guilty to three charges of making indecent images of children after he was sent 41 illegal images by Alex Williams, a convicted paedophile.Edwards was the BBC’s lead presenter as recently as 2023 and announced the death of the late queen to the nation in 2022. He joined the corporation in 1984 and began anchoring the Ten O’Clock News in 2003.Channel 5 said its show’s team had access to The Sun’s investigation into Edwards, which includedallegations about payments to a teenager for sexually explicit images. Ben Frow, Channel 5’s chief content officer, said it was “an important and shocking story”.“By gaining exclusive access to the key individuals involved and those who investigated the story, we explore the human cost behind the headlines,” he said.TV commentator and reviewer Scott Bryan said the channel had a track record of drawing viewers in with controversial topics.“Channel 5 has a knack for creating highbrow drama, but also documentary and factual series that raise eyebrows and perhaps cause controversy, but will get people tuning in out of intrigue,” he said.It has been willing to embrace current affairs stories in its factual and reality programming. In 2024, it broadcast an edition of the Cast Away survival show featuring former ITV This Morning presenter Phillip Schofield.Schofield left his presenting role after it emerged hehad lied about an affair with a younger member of staff. During the programme, Schofield said he had been “thrown under the bus”.Explore more on these topicsHuw EdwardsChannel 5Television industrynewsShareReuse this content"

The average duration of weight loss treatment being 39 weeks while the average follow up period was 32 weeks.On average, weight was regained at a rate of 0.4kg per month for people who had stopped taking the medication, the analysis found, with participants returning to their original weight within an average of 1.7 years after stopping any type of weight loss medication.UK medical regulator warns against buying weight-loss jabs from social media channelsRead moreSpecifically, people on any kind of weight loss medication lost an average of 8.3kg during treatment, but regained 4.8kg within the first year,The rate at which weight was regained after stopping these medications was almost four times faster compared with behavioural programmes, which may include a specific diet or physical activity plan, regardless of the amount of weight that was lost during treatment.Dr Sam West, of the Nuffield Department of Primary Care Health Sciences at theUniversity of Oxford, said the rapid weight gain seen after stopping weight loss drugs was not due to the medication itself.“These medicines are transforming obesity treatment and can achieve important weight loss. However, our research shows that people tend to regain weight rapidly after stopping – faster than we see with behavioural programmes,” West said.He added: “This isn’t a failing of the medicines – it reflects the nature of obesity as a chronic, relapsing condition. It sounds a cautionary note for short-term use without a more comprehensive approach to long-term weight management, and highlights the importance of primary prevention.”Previous studies have suggested weight loss medication can also have a beneficial impact on other areas of a patient’s health, as seen in the study intodrugs that could halve heart patients’ risk of an early death.However, this study also found that the benefits weight loss drugs can have on cardio-metabolic health markers, such as on blood pressure and cholesterol, also returned to their original level within 1.4 years of stopping treatment.Although previous studies have suggested people onweight loss drugs regain all the weight they have lost within a yearof stopping medication, this is the first study which provides the rate of weight regain and estimated time frames for weight and metabolic reversal.Wegovy can be prescribed on theNHSfor up to two years, while there is no prescription time limit for Mounjaro.“Weight loss drugs can be effective tools for managing weight and type 2 diabetes risk – but this research reinforces that they are not a quick fix, according to Dr Faye Riley, the research communications lead at Diabetes UK.“They need to be prescribed appropriately, with tailored wraparound support alongside them, to ensure people can fully benefit and maintain weight loss for as long as possible when they stop taking the medication.”Katharine Jenner, the executive director of theObesityHealth Alliance, said regaining weight after stopping treatment was not a failure of individuals, but rather “reflects the reality of living in a food environment that continually pushes people towards unhealthy options.”“These drugs can create a window of opportunity to improve the food environment at scale and pace – from junk food marketing to the affordability and availability of healthier food – otherwise many people will struggle to sustain the health benefits of weight loss drugs over the long term,” Jenner said.An NHS spokesperson said: “While these new treatments are an important new tool for supporting weight loss, they’re not a magic fix and must be paired with behavioural and lifestyle wraparound support including advice on healthier diets and physical activity to keep the weight off in the long term.“The NHS continues to implement innovative ways to support people to lose weight safely and sustainably as well as offering a range of weight management services, including the NHS digital weight management programme, which will be expanded to 125,000 more people per year as part of the 10-year health plan.”Explore more on these topicsHealthWeight-loss drugsMedical researchObesityNHSUniversity of OxfordnewsShareReuse this content"

His response to claims of racism, which he was first questioned on in 2013 by the Channel 4 reporter Michael Crick, haveshifted over time.In a broadcast interview in November, he said: “I would never, ever do it in a hurtful or insulting way. It’s 49 years ago. It’s 49 years ago. I had just entered my teens. Can I remember everything that happened at school? No, I can’t. Have I ever been part of an extremist organisation or engaged in direct, unpleasant, personal abuse, genuine abuse, on that basis? No.”Challenged again about whether he had racially abused anyone, Farage responded: “No, not with intent.”But when asked at aReform UKpress conference in central London on Wednesday why he had not apologised to his accusers, he said: “I don’t apologise for things that are complete made-up fantasies.”Amid loud booing from Reform members directed at the ITV journalist who asked the question, Farage added: “Some of what is out there is just absolute nonsense made by people with very obvious, if you look, political motivation.” He said others could focus on “stuff that happened in the 1970s” but Reform was looking ahead to the May local elections.Farage has been asked to apologise in aletter signed by 26of his school contemporaries. Last month anex-Dulwich teacherspoke out about the racism claims, saying: “Of course he abused pupils.”Farage was speaking at an event in London Bridge at which Laila Cunningham, a Muslim and former CPS prosecutor, was announced as Reform’s candidate for London mayor when the capital goes to the polls in 2028.During the press conference, Farage said remarks by another Reform mayoral candidate,Chris Parry– who suggested the London-born David Lammy should “go home” to the Caribbean – were “over the top”, when questioned about the issue for the first time.The Reform leader was asked whether Parry was a good representative of the party in light of his views. In a past tweet that came to light at the end of last year, Parry, Reform’s candidate for the Hampshire and the Solent mayoralty, suggested the deputy prime minister’s “loyalty lies” in the Caribbean.Farage said Parry had also criticised “many white politicians, called them unpatriotic, and suggested they went to live in other countries”, but said: “Some of his comments are a bit rich.”He said: “I get that. He is intensely patriotic. He’s risen to the rank of rear admiral, he’s given enormous service to this country. But I do think his comments on Lammy were over the top and he should apologise for them.”Cunningham, asked if she thought London was too diverse, said the problem in the capital was “not about diversity”, adding that her parents had come from Egypt in the 1960s and had had to integrate.“But what you find in certain parts of London is that immigration is too much, and when it’s too many, they dominate,” she said. “And you do have certain parts of London where people who have been in that area, grew up there, do not feel it’s their part any more. It doesn’t feel like London, and that is a problem.”Farage boycotted prime minister’s questions in the Commons on Wednesday to appear on Times Radio, saying it was “more worthwhile than sitting in the House of Commons being abused by a prime minister and having absolutely no chance to respond”.He faced criticism from Labour’s Michael Shanks, who wrote on X that Farage had been selected to ask a question in the Commons on Tuesday on energy but had withdrawn and did not “bother to turn up”.Commenting on Farage’s decision to boycott PMQs, the Labour MP Chris Bryant wrote: “Not really an mp at all.”Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

Thoughincreasing in size, they have not yet reached the size of previous movements such as the 2022 Mahsa Amini protests, which saw popular anger erupt after the 22-year-old woman died in police custody.‘We want the mullahs gone’: economic crisis sparks biggest protests in Iran since 2022Read moreInitially sparked by economic conditions and led at first by traders, the demonstrationshave since expandedto address grievances of the public towards the government, particularly as its crackdown intensifies. Videos showed students at Kermanshah University calling for the return of Reza Pahlavi, the exiled son of the former shah of Iran, while other videos showed protesters resisting teargas shot by authorities to disperse them.Seven Iranian Kurdish opposition parties called for a general strike on Thursday, while Pahlavi also called for unified protests across the country on the same day.“[The strike] will send an important signal to the entire country: that the resistance in Kurdistan is standing strong and that people are ready to continue. This is a peaceful action, and we sincerely hope that people will not be attacked,” said Hiwa Bahrami, the head of foreign relations for the Democratic party of Iranian Kurdistan.View image in fullscreenVideo footage shows protesters in the Malekshahi district of western Iran’s Ilam province on Saturday.Photograph: UGC/AFP/Getty ImagesTwo separate protesters from Kermanshah told the Guardian they had witnessed security forces shooting at protesters. The eyewitness testimony was confirmed by the Norway-basedHengaworganisation for human rights, which said it had documented the use of Kalashnikov rifles against protesters on Wednesday.At least 36 people, including four children and two members of Iran’s security forces,have been killedin the violence surrounding protests, according to the US-basedHuman Rights Activists news agency(Hrana). More than 2,100 people have been arrested so far, according to the agency, with a spate of detentions of Kurdish protesters on Wednesday.Iran’s government has thus far taken a carrot-and-stick approach to the protests, with public servants offering dialogueand economic reformwhile security forces have struck a more defiant tone.View image in fullscreenFootage appears to show Iranian security forces using teargas to disperse demonstrators in Tehran.Photograph: UGC/AFP/Getty ImagesIran’s president, Masoud Pezeshkian, has ordered investigations into videos which show riot-gear clad security forces raiding a hospital in Ilam, and his government announced the doubling of a state subsidy for breadwinners across the country. The new subsidy, which would provide £5.20 a month, is meant to ease the soaring price of basic goods such as food and medicine.At the same time, the head of Iran’s army warned the military would not sit idly by as international powers threatened to strike Iran in aid of protesters, and would take pre-emptive action. The US president, Donald Trump, hadsaid last weekthat the US would come to the rescue of protesters if Iran’s government shot and killed them – a threat that has grown more alarming for Iran since the US capture of the Venezuelan president, Nicolás Maduro, on Saturday.“The Islamic Republic considers the intensification of such rhetoric against the Iranian nation as a threat and will not leave its continuation without a response,” said Maj Gen Amir Hatami, according to Iranian state media. He said while protests were normal, the transformation of demonstrations into riots was “undoubtedly planned by the enemies”.As demonstrations continue, the economic conditions which initially triggered them worsen. The nation’s currency is depreciating, and traders have warned the price of basic goods would soar after the government announced it would cancel a programme which allowed importers and producers to use a preferential exchange rate for certain goods.View image in fullscreenProtests continued well into the night in Isfahan on 1 January.Photograph: X/IranProtestsComThe people of Iran have suffered for years due to economic mismanagement and some of the world’s harshest sanctions being placed on the country. Iran’s currency has lost two-thirds of its value in the last three years while the prices of basic goods have continued to increase. The average price of food had increased by 72% over the last year.The government has acknowledged the population’s economic woe, but has said further belt-tightening would be necessary, blaming the crisis on external factors. The vice-president, Mohammad Jafar Ghaempanah, said on Wednesday that Iran was in a “full-fledged economic war”, calling for the elimination of corruption and price-gouging within the country.Despite the escalating violence, protesters said they intended to stay on the streets and respond to the calls for protests tomorrow. Families of demonstrators killed during the 2022 protests said they had been instructed by the intelligence services not to join protests tomorrow.“They are shooting at anyone and everyone. We are united with the rest of the people across [Iran]. They stood by us in 2022 and will stand by them this time. Tomorrow is the day all the Kurdish people will be on the streets,” said Soran, from Kermanshah, speaking under a pseudonym.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

The judge assigned a public defender to represent Nick Reiner, who had been expected to be arraigned and enter a plea in aLos Angelescourt on Wednesday.Jackson, a high-profile attorney who has represented Harvey Weinstein, Kevin Spacey and Karen Read, said that legal and ethical reasons prevented him from sharing why he had sought removal from the case, but that Nick Reiner was not guilty.“Circumstances beyond our control and, more importantly, circumstances beyond Nick’s control have dictated that, sadly, it’s made it impossible to continue our representation of Nick,” Jackson said outside the courthouse.He told reporters that “what we’ve learned, and you can take this to the bank, is that pursuant to the laws of this state, pursuant to the law ofCalifornia, Nick Reiner is not guilty of murder. Print that.”The 32-year-old has been in custody since last month, hours after the acclaimed director and actor, 78, and his wife Michele, 70, a photographer, were found dead in their Los Angeles-area home. Authorities allege that Nick Reiner fatally stabbed the couple.Wednesday’s proceedings marked his first appearance in court in three weeks. In the courtroom, he could be seen behind glass, with his hair shaved and wearing brown jail attire.The Los Angeles county medical examiner found that Rob and Michele Reiner’s deaths were the result of homicide, caused by “multiple sharp force injuries” and that they diedminutes afterbeing attacked. Nick Reiner has been charged with first-degree murder, with a special circumstance of multiple murders, and a special allegation for the use of a dangerous weapon, and is being held without bail.Nick Reiner has previously struggled with addiction and mental illness, and collaborated with his father on the filmBeing Charlie, which was reportedly loosely inspired by his own experiences. He had reportedly been prescribed medication used to treat schizophrenia for an unknown period of time before the killings, according to theLos Angeles Times.Rob Reiner, one of Hollywood’s most celebrated directors, was known for films including This Is Spinal Tap, When Harry Met Sally and The Princess Bride, among others, while Michele Singer Reiner was a producer and photographer, whose work included a portrait of Donald Trump that was used on his book The Art of the Deal. They were also well-known for championing liberal causes.News of the killings sent shock waves through Hollywood last month and prompted an outpouring of grief from the public and the couple’s friends, including Larry David, Billy Crystal, Albert Brooks, Martin Short and Barack and Michelle Obama.“Strong and determined, Michele and Rob Reiner devoted a great deal of their lives for the betterment of our fellow citizens … They were a special force together – dynamic, unselfish and inspiring. We were their friends, and we will miss them forever,”friends wrote of the couple.Nick Reiner’s former attorney, Jackson, had urged the public not to rush to judgment or jump to conclusions and said there are “very complex and serious issues” associated with the “devastating tragedy”. On Wednesday, he said his team had received a call about representing Nick Reiner hours after his arrest.“For the last three weeks, we have devoted literally every waking hour to protecting Nick and his interests. We’ve investigated this matter top to bottom, back to front,” Jackson said, adding that “the legal process will reveal the true facts”.Nick Reiner has been held in jail for weeks and was recently taken off suicide watch, according toPeople. He remains in solitary confinement, where he is frequently monitored, and medical professionals have found he has a “mental disability”, a source told the magazine.If convicted, he could face the death penalty or life in prison without the possibility of parole.He will appear in court for arraignment on 23 February.Explore more on these topicsUS newsRob ReinerCaliforniaUS crimeWest CoastLaw (US)Los AngelesnewsShareReuse this content"

The film won Buckley a Critics Choice award last weekend for her raw performance as mother struggling with the death of her son.“What I’ve learned from making Hamnet,” said Zhao, “is that feminine leadership – and that doesn’t mean just women, it means the feminine consciousness in all people – is drawing strength from interdependence, not dominance. So it’s drawing strength from intuition, relationships, community and interdependence.“So it doesn’t fit into the current model that we exist in, the container we exist in. It’s difficult to come through, and I feel very lucky that I had people in power that trusted that this way of leading is needed for this story.”The annual USC Annenberg Inclusion Initiative surveys the gender, race and ethnicity of directors across the top performing US films. This year’s study recorded a considerable year-on-year decline for female directors, with 8.1% of the US’s 100 highest-grossing films helmed by women in 2025, compared with 13.4% (15 women) the previous year.Hamnet opens in the UK this Friday but was released in the US on 26 November, where it has so far earned $12m at the box office. Other notable successes on the list were Celine Song’s followup to Past Lives, Materialists ($36.5m), and Nisha Ganatra’s Freakier Friday ($94.2m).Author of the report, Stacy L Smith, said the findings reveal that “progress for women directors has been fleeting”.Smith added that, “while it is tempting to think that these changes are a result of who is in the Oval Office” – in apparent reference to Donald Trump’s diversity policy rollbacks – she concluded the decline from 2024’s figures was “driven by executive decision-making that took place long before any DEI prohibitions took effect. Many of these films were greenlit and in pre-production before the 2024 election.”Zhao co-wrote the screenplay for Hamnet with Maggie O’Farrell, author of the best-selling novel of the same name.The Guardian’s film critic, Peter Bradshaw,described the film as “a deeply felt romantic fantasy”, praising it in his five-star reviewas a “thrilling act of creative audacity” that is “ingenious and impassioned at the same time”.It has emerged a leading contender this Oscars season, with Zhao poised to repeat her landmark 2021 victory, when she became the second woman – and first woman of colour – to win the Academy Award for best director. Her key competition this year is likely to be Paul Thomas Anderson, for One Battle After Another, and Sinners’ Ryan Coogler. Should he win, Coogler would become the first black film-maker to win the best director Oscar.Explore more on these topicsFilm industryChloé ZhaonewsShareReuse this content"

The Trump administration has also said it isexamining “a range of options” to acquire Greenland, and noted that using the US military to do so is “always an option”.On Truth Social, Trump wrote: “All United State Defense Contractors, and the Defense Industry as a whole, BEWARE: While we make the best Military Equipment in the World (No other Country is even close!), Defense Contractors are currently issuing massive Dividends to their Shareholders and massive Stock Buybacks, at the expense and detriment of investing in Plants and Equipment. This situation will no longer be allowed or tolerated!“Executive Pay Packages in the Defense Industry are exorbitant and unjustifiable given how slowly these Companies are delivering vital Equipment to our Military, and our Allies,” he added. “Salaries, Stock Options, and every other form of Compensation are far too high for these Executives.”In fiscal year 2024, the CEOs of Lockheed Martin andGeneral Dynamicsreceivedmore than $23.7meach in total compensation, the RTX CEO receivedmore than $18m, and the Northrop Grumman CEO receivedmore than $24.3m.General Dynamics declined to comment. Lockheed Martin, RTX and Northrop Grumman did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Trump has pushed military defense spending to nearly $1tn annually, signing abilllast month authorizing a record $901bn. But on Wednesday, he raised the prospect of increasing the overall budget to $1.5tn by 2027.“This will allow us to build the ‘Dream Military’ that we have long been entitled to and, more importantly, that will keep us SAFE and SECURE, regardless of foe,” Trump claimed.Less than two hours earlier, he had ordered the US defense sector to curb its payments to executives and shareholders.“I will not permit Dividends or Stock Buybacks for Defense Companies until such time as these problems are rectified – Likewise, for Salaries and Executive Compensation,” said Trump, without providing a legislative plan. “MILITARY EQUIPMENT IS NOT BEING MADE FAST ENOUGH! It must be built now with the Dividends, Stock Buybacks, and Over Compensation of Executives, rather than borrowing from Financial Institutions, or getting the money from your Government.”Trump has been told by officials that Raytheon, owned by RTX, has been “the least responsive to the needs” of the Pentagon, “the slowest in increasing their volume, and the most aggressive spending on their Shareholders rather than the needs and demands of the United States Military”, he said.“Either Raytheon steps up, and starts investing in more upfront Investment like Plants and Equipment, or they will no longer be doing business with Department of War,” Trump wrote. “Also, if Raytheon wants further business with the United States Government, under no circumstances will they be allowed to do any additional Stock Buybacks, where they have spent Tens of Billions of Dollars, until they are able to get their act together.

And just days before he was due to open that store, Adrian stepped into a lake and didn’t ever return home.“Adrian’s wife and widow, my constituent Tracey, is wondering if the prime minister will review franchising legislation to ensure there is a balance of power between companies and the franchisee so that nobody else feels undue pressure when they take on a franchise?”Starmer replied: “Obviously there’s a live legal case I can’t comment on, but I can reassure her that we’ll look closely at the final outcome of that case. There are strong rules in place, but we will look at the outcome of the case to see if there is more that can be done.”The Howe family are not part of the ongoing legal claim, which Vodafone is contesting.The commitment by the prime minister to examine franchising legislation comes after the government said last month that it may consider new laws to correct the power imbalance in franchise agreements in response to the “harrowing stories” of small business people runningVodafonestores.A spokesperson for Vodafone said: “Our sympathies remain with the Howe family. It is simply not true to suggest that Adrian Howe was forced to take on a poorly performing store and we absolutely reject this suggestion.“Vodafone continues to run a successful franchise business, with over 350 stores today, and the majority of franchisees have expanded their business with us. At the time of his death, Adrian Howe was not a franchise partner.”The company added that it has tried to resolve the “complex commercial dispute” with the 62 claimants and remains open to further talks.Explore more on these topicsVodafoneKeir StarmerLabourTelecommunications industryCorporate governanceHouse of CommonsnewsShareReuse this content"

Any reading below 50 indicates contraction. Economists had predicted a slight improvement, to 42.5.Ministers may cut green tech mandate from new homes regulations in EnglandRead more“UK construction companies once again reported challenging business conditions and falling workloads in December, but the speed of the downturn moderated from the five-and-a-half-year record seen in November,” said Tim Moore, an economics director at S&P Global Market Intelligence.“Many firms cited subdued demand and fragile client confidence. Despite a lifting of budget-related uncertainty, delayed spending decisions were still cited as contributing to weak sales pipelines at the close of the year.”The housebuilding subindex dropped to 33.5, the lowest since May 2020, when building sites were closed down after the Covid outbreak prompted the UK government to declare a nationwide lockdown.The housing secretary, Steve Reed,acknowledgedlast month that a sharp increase in housebuilding was needed to meet Labour’s promiseto build 1.5m new homesin England over five years. Housebuilders have predicted that the government will miss its ambitious target.Output in the commercial sector also fell at the fastest pace in more than five and a half years in December, with the index at 42. While the downturn in civil engineering eased, it remained the weakest sector, reflected by a reading of 32.9.However, construction companies became more optimistic about the outlook for the coming 12 months, and confidence hit its highest level since July, helped by the prospect of lower borrowing costs as well as the lifting of uncertainty about the contents of Rachel Reeves’s November budget.The study showed 37% of companies polled predicted a rise in output levels during the year ahead, compared with 20% that forecast a decline.Rising infrastructure spending and weaker inflationary pressure also prompted hopes of a turnaround.New orders and employment declined in December, but to a lesser extent than in November.The all-sector PMI – which comprises services, manufacturing and construction reports for December – edged up to 50.4 from 50.1 in November, pointing to a small expansion across the economy.Elliott Jordan-Doak, the senior UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said: “We expect the construction PMI itself to remain subdued in the coming months, given how entrenched negative sentiment appears to be within the sector.“Moreover, there are few reasons for businesses in the construction sector to be more cheerful. The budget’s prioritisation of higher welfare spending rather than investment will come as a disappointment to many builders, and the boost to activity from falling interest rates will be modest this year.“Meanwhile, the chancellor’smansion taxwill exert further downward pressure on the housing market. So, we expect only modest growth in construction sector activity in 2026, with risks tilted to the downside.”From April 2028, the government will introduce a high-value council tax surcharge – which has been labelled a “mansion tax” – for properties worth more than £2m in England, of £2,500 a year, rising to £7,500 for properties worth more than £5m. However, this was not as sizeable as feared by some.UK house pricesfell unexpectedlyin December but have beentipped to rise as much as 4%this year by Nationwide building society. First-time buyersare expected to drive the housing marketthis year.Explore more on these topicsConstruction industryHousing marketnewsShareReuse this content"

So why the backlash?Jesse HassengerWed 7 Jan 2026 04.47 ESTLast modified on Wed 7 Jan 2026 12.27 ESTShareIn the new hit movieMarty Supreme, the story is pushed forward by how lead character Marty Mauser keeps making messes then, rather than cleaning them up, manages to expand their scope beyond reason. Marty is attempting to prove himself as the world’s greatest table-tennis champion, to escape his meagre mid-century New York City circumstances and achieve a dream he’s locked on to, seemingly more out of desire to achieve it than a particular love for the sport.And just as he’s presumably blown up some natural athleticism into a monomaniacal quest, all of Marty’s misdeeds across the film escalate. He cajoles, then lies. He quickly turns a pushy request to borrow money into petty theft, which then becomes armed robbery. At one point, a little ping-pong hustle at a New Jersey bowling alley literally blows up into a gas-station fire. Marty will not accept anything less than ultimate victory, which means he will especially not accept responsibility for his actions. And we, in the audience, are invited to like him anyway, at least in part because he is played byTimothée Chalamet.As Marty Supreme has reached a sizable audience, that last bit has become a sticking point, at least for some. There are plenty of YouTube and TikTok videos asking why, exactly, we’re supposed to be happily following this near-sociopathic character for well over two hours, causing publications such as Variety toweigh inon Marty (and Chalamet’s) likability.View image in fullscreen‘Unpleasant’ … Jennifer Lawrence in Die My Love.Photograph: Kimberly FrenchThis is not the first likability conversation inspired by an awards-season contender, and it won’t be the last. But it feels like the first time in a while that this kind of bafflement (or tut-tutting) has been expressed toward a male lead in particular. The self-interested protagonists of best picture nominees such as Birdman, American Hustle, Joker, or Once Upon a Time in Hollywood didn’t appear to inspire much discourse about whether they were proper male role models; those discussions more often turn to women, especially in depictions of motherhood, such as Jennifer Lawrence’s character in the recent Die My Love. That movie barely seems to be in the awards conversation despite a bravura turn from Lawrence, in part because of the sheer difficulty audiences have found in getting on the movie’s aggressive, “unpleasant” wavelength.So in a way, the regression to fretting about the likability of Marty Mauser feels weirdly just. But there may still be some gendering going on here; it’s hard to untangle questions of Marty’s likability from Chalamet himself, particularly his combination of a slender, more stereotypically “feminine” appearance and semi-parodic macho bravado (in the film and his tireless promotion of it). Rather than his star charisma mitigating Marty’s bad behaviour, Chalamet’s beauty (and appeal to female fans) only seems to further inflame anyone who might not be convinced by his big-noise status.It’s happened repeatedly with Chalamet’s closest analog in ambition and star power:Leonardo DiCaprio– whom audiences and critics have most recently greeted as downright lovable playing a burnt-out, half-competent ex-radical in One Battle After Another. But in movies such as Killers of the Flower Moon and especially The Wolf of Wall Street, DiCaprio faced questions of whether he and the movies in question were glorifying criminals simply by depicting them at such length. DiCaprio’s Jordan Belfort (like Marty Mauser, based on a real-life figure, though the Marty Supreme adaptation is far looser) was a particular object of ire, with hand-wringing over whether audiences could even really discern Belfort’s criminality when cast in the megastar image of Leo.To complain about a character’s likability while also worrying about modelling poor behaviour is to place yourself above the rest of the audience; sure, you understand how bad this guy is, but what about all the dolts who aren’t so enlightened? Let’s assume, though, that at least some objections to Marty Supreme are not concern-trolling but genuine dislike: a visceral reaction against spending 150 minutes with such a selfish jerk (and scepticism over whether the film’s ending even begins to redeem him). Who can’t identify with feeling an animal dislike toward a fresh-faced brat? As it happens, I get it from a lot of YouTubers and TikTok scolds.View image in fullscreenNo prize for likability … Timothée Chalamet wins best actor for Marty Supreme at the Critics Choice awards this month.Photograph: Kevin Winter/Getty Images for Critics Choice AssociationBut lingering questions of a character’s likability – their ability to serve as a rooting interest, a figure of audience identification, or even a charismatic antihero – can feel like a particular curse and gift of the cinema. A novel can (if the author so chooses) dig deeper into a specific character’s psychology, and while there will always be readers who, say, whine about Holden Caulfield’s whininess, there are also plenty of English teachers who can guide readers through The Catcher in the Rye or other books where the protagonist may not scan as a lovably scrappy underdog (or whatever students may have been mistrained to expect from literature).Movies, though, don’t come with the same degree of instruction. We’re not taught as much about how or why to “read” them as students, and they’re presented foremost as entertainment. As much as they can and should be vehicles for more than that, mainstream cinema has also spent more than a century basking in the glow of stars. A movie star’s job, after all, is to draw and hold our attention, even if the immediate circumstances of their surroundings might otherwise strike us as overfamiliar, obtuse or dull. When a star pushes too hard, too soon, against that innate expectation of likability, it can feel like a broken contract.‘I fear electromagnetic catastrophe’: Josh Safdie on Marty Supreme, latent Jewish anxiety and why men are lostRead moreThe art of cinema deserves more than demanding shiny things for our amusement, of course, but it’s also uniquely able to provide those shiny things. Tedious likability conversations may be the price we pay for that beguilement – which is also never going to work equally on every single audience member. Some who blanch at Chalamet’s snot-nosed, self-inflated insouciance in Marty Supreme may find themselves, in 20 years, watching Chalamet play an equally “unlikable” character and be charmed by him anyway. I’m honestly not all that convinced there’s a literary depth to Marty Mauser’s sins, but then, it also didn’t occur to me to disconnect from Marty Supreme for that reason. In a film culture that often seems to be aspiring to homogenisation, being allowed to spend time in the company of immoral or obnoxious characters can feel like its own strange magic trick. Likability may be an unfair demand placed on cinema, but such an expansive medium is, in the long run, more than up to the task.Explore more on these topicsMarty SupremeTimothée ChalametLeonardo DiCapriofeaturesShareReuse this content"

She talks about dread, dreams and her bid for ‘controlled chaos’Wed 7 Jan 2026 04.28 ESTLast modified on Wed 7 Jan 2026 07.48 ESTShareBefore her first Edinburgh fringe run last summer, Ayoade Bamgboye put a question to her comedy friends: “How do you debut?” She recalls their advice: “You introduce yourself, and there’s a point of view. There should also be a narrative arc. And you need to establish who you are as a comedian.” This was a lot to hear. “It filled me with dread,” says the 31-year-old. “There’s this recurring thought that you can only debut once. If it falls flat, then you’re just a shit debutante, forever.”Reader, Bamgboye avoided this fate, and then some. A fringe first-timer with a very slender comedy CV behind her, the Londoner-via-Lagos arrived at the festival with a fresh-minted show, Swings and Roundabouts, and left clutching theprestigious best newcomer award, as formerly won by Harry Hill, Sarah Millican andTim Minchin. (She was the first Black woman to win the award.) It’s a ticket to the big time and Bamgboye is still reeling. “These past months have been very difficult, getting out of my head and out of my own way. That question of: why me, why this, why now?” Sometimes, only a cliche will cover it. “It changed my life,” says Bamgboye flatly. “I hate to say stuff like that, but it did.”View image in fullscreen‘Every single day was such a variation’ … Bamgboye at the Edinburgh fringe in 2025.You can believe she hates to say it: as an hour in her company makes clear, Bamgboye is a searching thinker, a caretaker of words, playfully alert to their connotations. This is not a woman to drop a hackneyed phrase – or at least, not without wondering why the London Borough of Hackney is getting the blame for it. Several times during our chat, she withdraws a notebook to jot down idioms that sound curious to her African incomer’s ear. One anthropological section of Swings and Roundabouts is dedicated to British phrases that connote misery. A captivating feature of the show is the slippery fun it has with Bamgboye’s cross-cultural identity – a well-spoken Englishwoman when it pleases her, flipping into Nigerian-accented outsiderdom between words, sentences, at will.View image in fullscreenBamgboye with her Edinburgh Comedy award for best newcomer.Photograph: Alan RennieShe’s the same in conversation, a vocal shapeshifter – the product of a childhood shuttling back and forth from Lagos to a Lake District boarding school. Swings and Roundabouts showcases a woman raised like a gift from God (her name, she crows onstage, means “crown of joy”) but living uneasily in adulthood, caught between continents, grieving the loss of her beloved dad. “With this show I wanted to introduce myself and to share how difficult I find it to be alive,” she says – but, if you’re thinking “trauma comedy”, that radically undersells the joyful whirlwind experience of watching Bamgboye’s debut. Try this instead: “I’m trying to find a creative practice that’s like a controlled chaos. I wanted to split the difference between ‘you’re in safe hands’ and ‘you don’t know what’s going to happen next’.”Or try her response to my request for her comedy influences, which elicits the never-before-combined trio of Jack Black, Maya Rudolph andChris Morris. Bamgboye is nothing if not her own woman, a relative comedy ingenue who had “never really told the same joke twice” before her Edinburgh run – and who approached the fringe thinking that “if I’m going to be saying and doing the same thing over and again for a month, it has to be something that’s exciting for me to say and do”. The revelation last summer for Bamgboye was that, just because the words are repeated, the in-the-moment encounter with an audience can be renewed completely from one night to the next. “Every single day was such a variation. Every day something in the room or from the audience gave me something new to play with.”Ayoade Bamgboye: Swings and Roundabouts review – commanding comic’s thrilling debutRead more“Since then, there’s a change in the kind of performance I want to do, and it puts the people in front of me first.” In conversation, Bamgboye is bursting with a sense of the possibilities her new comedy life has opened up to her. Until recently, she was a drifting creative in the arts and media, including working as assistant to the director Yorgos Lanthimos on his moviePoor Things. Now, cooking up a new set about small talk, and crash-coursing a comedy education from her various mentors (who includeJamali Maddixand previous best newcomer champLara Ricote), “my whole existence,” says Bamgboye, “is now set-ups for jokes, and it makes me more excited to live”.“Maybe that’s too much,” she edits herself, characteristically. “But it has been a real gift to learn how to express myself in this way. And this is just the beginning. There are so many things I still want to try in comedy. I feel like a guest [in this industry] who hasn’t taken her shoes off yet. I haven’t even been upstairs. Now I’m here, I’m in it for the long haul.”Ayoade Bamgboye: Swings and Roundabouts is atSoho theatre, London, 13-24 January and 20 April-2 May and istouringExplore more on these topicsComedyEdinburgh festival 2025Edinburgh festivalSoho theatreinterviewsShareReuse this content"

Yes. But it’s mainly just tedious to watch these immature players and their teenage machinations as they battle for cashHannah J DaviesWed 7 Jan 2026 00.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 7 Jan 2026 00.06 ESTShareThe first season of Beast Games – the big-money reality challenge masterminded and hosted by internet personality Jimmy Donaldson, better known as MrBeast – prompted a lawsuit. Five anonymous contestants sued both the production companies behind the series and Donaldson himself, claiming that they had been kept “underfed and overtired”, and alleging an unsafe environment on the set of the Gladiators-ish, Squid Game-esque series (claims, of course, firmly denied by all parties). While the participants claimed they had been “shamelessly exploited” in the name of entertainment, this did little to impede the success of Beast Games, which went on to become Amazon’smost-watched unscripted series ever,garnering 50 million viewers in the month after its release.You may well come to Beast Games with a sense that this is a slightly murky, mercenary endeavour, the $5m grand prize (“generational wealth!!!!” says Donaldson) distracting from potential ethical issues just below the surface. Weirdly, though, moral issues will probably be the least of viewers’ concerns. More than ever, in its second series Beast Games also happens to be mindless, vibeless television, flecked with Squiddy sadism but also borrowing heavily from the Love Island playbook. As they stay up into the wee hours building improbably high towers from foam blocks or playing convoluted games of dodgeball, the contestants couple up, crash out and even seek to avenge fallen players. Take Luisitin, playing to defend the honour of his wife from series one, by badmouthing her former nemesis, Karim, to anyone who will listen (“he and his brother gaslit my wife on television!”) People say things like “be careful who you trust!” and “he’s backpack boy … his girlfriend is carrying him over the finish line”. You don’t get this sort of feuding on Ninja Warrior, that’s for sure.As is de rigueur, contestants are shamelessly milked for their personal tragedies. Within minutes, we learn that one participant wishes to use the prize money for a relative’s cancer treatment; later, we hear of people wanting a better life for their families, or looking for funds to help cure rare diseases. But, really, Beast Games doesn’t feel any more cloying than any other series of its ilk, or indeed Donaldson’s own online efforts to helpamputeeswalk again, orcure 1,000 people’s blindness. Strangely, though, it has an immaturity running through it that quickly reminds me of my teenage years. Two players, Jim and Monika, immediately become an item (“shall we make it official?!”), while Luisitin makes it his mission to get another player kicked off the show as quickly as possible, by getting the others to ignore him during a challenge called Bluff, where players have to work out what colour disc they have attached to the backs of their heads. Initially, I thought that Beast City – the show’s heavily floodlit set, where the 200 contestants live and compete – is a bit like a prison, albeit if prisons had their own 24-hour branches of Starbucks. Slowly, I realise it is more like high school.This season, MrBeast and friends have split the contestants up into two teams, Strong and Smart, playing once again into an adolescent view of the world. Perhaps unsurprisingly, as the challenges become more physical, more of the “smart” team (among them, Trina, who – we are told – has the same IQ as Einstein) begin to fail. What this segregation is supposed to prove is anyone’s guess (people who self-select as strong are better at athletic challenges?!), although in Beast City the aim may simply be to divide and conquer. Players are offered cash bribes to leave the game, which is all well and good until you realise that they may also be getting other people booted out in the process.MrBeast attracts a lot of attention for his questionable online antics: this is a man who made his name doing things likelocking people in isolation for 100 days. By that token, Beast Games isn’t particularly controversial. It is, however, prodigiously childish. As well as a rictus grin, Donaldson sports a blazer over a hoodie for the duration of the series, which is deeply unflattering and also a metaphor for his contest. As much as it hopes to smarten up its act, Beast Games feels like the TV equivalent of the sad Christmas fair where an ailing horse is given some antlers and told to look lively. It is fairly cruel, sure, but it’s also incredibly turgid – and maybe that’s worse.Beast Games is on Prime Video now.Explore more on these topicsTelevision & radioTV reviewTelevisionreviewsShareReuse this content"

Jim Henson’s fantasy adventure mixes human actors, unmistakably Hensonian puppet creatures, and one authentic legend who goes beyond either category:David Bowie as Jareth, the spikily coiffured king of the goblins, towering over the diminutive figures the way he might if he’d been a guest on The Muppet Show. He carries off this wacky role with absolute commitment and good humour.Labyrinth also features cherubic teen Jennifer Connelly as Sarah, a girl who is infuriated at being made to look after her baby half-brother Toby when her dad and stepmom are out for the evening. In a fit of loneliness and pique, influenced by a fairytale she has been reading called The Labyrinth, and perhaps unable to process the psychological reasons for her resentment of baby Toby, Sarah makes a spiteful wish that goblins take the infant away. This they do, and Sarah is faced with a daunting quest: she must somehow get through the labyrinth that surrounds Jareth’s castle and wrest the poor child from his awful grasp.Labyrinth is obviously influenced by Lewis Carroll: Sarah has very Alice-type encounters with conceited and talkative creatures who have a tendency to make quibbling, riddling demands on her – and she falls weightlessly down holes. The film also takes a good deal fromMaurice Sendak’s Where the Wild Things Are, a book that is glimpsed in an early scene, and Sendak is explicitly thanked in the credits. There is a rather amazing hallucinatory sequence at the end in which Sarah confronts Jareth directly, which is taken from MC Escher. But watched again, we can perhaps see how Labyrinth might have been a subconscious influence on someone else, an author who had vaguely registered some details: along with the goblins there are owls flying mysteriously about, and a certain goblin called Hoggle is wrongly addressed as “Hogwart”.This is a very analogue-era movie with analogue-type storytelling and dialogue: it is not driven with the same hyperactive focused energy that modern Pixar/Disney films have. The action often ambles and dawdles and the dialogue, written by Terry Jones, has a casually constructed but often very funny humour. A year later, Rob Reiner would give usThe Princess Bride, which is comparable in some ways. But this is utterly unique whimsy and fun.Labyrinth is in UK cinemas from 9 January, and in Australian cinemas from 22 January.Explore more on these topicsFilmScience fiction and fantasy filmsAnimation in filmDavid BowiereviewsShareReuse this content"

I had to find all the pieces of me, scattered all around, and put them back together, one by one.” Following a cardiac arrest which left him clinically dead for 40 minutes, Jago Trevarno, the young narrator of Patrick Charnley’s moving debut novel, has retreated to the Cornish village where he grew up, to shelter under the protection of his “off-gridder” uncle, Jacob.His mother dead of cancer and his father long gone, at 20 Jago’s world seems to have shrunk to nothing but the hard daily labour of working a subsistence farm high above the rugged Atlantic coast. The life Jago had begun to construct in the city, “a runaway train” in flight from his mother’s death and everything that reminded him of her, has evaporated abruptly in the aftermath of his near-death experience. He has “gone from someone who needed to slow down, to be present, to someone having no choice about it”, and must start from scratch.The building blocks available to Jago are basic. His injury has left him with “reduced processing power”: his brain’s responses are slow and have to remain so, calibrated for recovery. He is also in marked retreat from intense emotion, wary of the havoc it could wreak in his vulnerable synapses, and Jacob – kindly, protective and understanding but taciturn, unused to company – exerts only minimal emotional counterpressure.Together uncle and nephew live a life of extreme simplicity, their days governed by the weather, the animals, the seasons and the hours of daylight. But while this extraordinarily circumscribed and stable existence may be the perfect environment for his immediate recovery, as Jago’s condition improves the inevitable question arises as to whether he can live indefinitely in this sort of stasis, in hiding from the past and the outside world. And then the outside world takes matters into its own hands, because even an off-gridder has neighbours, well-meaning or otherwise – and sooner or later they make their presence felt.The prose is spare and beautiful, the narrative simple but sound – it is as finely wrought as poetryOn the benign side of the scale is Granny Carne, fierce and fiercely independent, loyal to Jago and Jacob, seer and holder of everyone’s secrets. And then there is Sophie. Jago’s first love, abandoned in the turbulent wake of his mother’s death, Sophie has never left the village, and her renewed presence in Jago’s life, along with the raft of painful feelings she evokes, inevitably begins to endanger his precarious hold on emotional stability.It is the notorious Bill Sligo, though, whose land sits above Jacob’s and whose brand-new Range Rover definitely wasn’t bought from farming profits, who presents the greatest threat to the life Jago is trying to rebuild. Sligo has his eye on one of Jacob’s fields, where the entry to an old mineshaft sits above a honeycomb of tunnels and caves – and when it begins to look as though he will go to any lengths to get it, Jago must decide whether to retreat or to engage.This, My Second Life is prefaced with a brief statement of the author’s own experience of cardiac arrest and brain injury. The son of the late and brilliant writer Helen Dunmore, Charnley has also lost a mother relatively young to cancer, yet to see the novel through the lens of personal trauma would be to do it a grave injustice. The prose is spare and beautiful, the narrative simple but sound – it is as finely wrought as poetry, luminous with Jago’s sheer delight in the world, electric with his fear that it might still at any moment be snatched away. The hypnotically seductive rhythms of days filled with only the most immediate things – the smell of a library or the colours of the sea, the “milky winter sun” or the exquisite savour of plain food – are layered to achieve a piercing intensity, the world made new. And as he details his own limitations and his meticulous efforts to navigate them, Jago’s distinctive voice emerges, a true and clear and entirely convincing creation, always reaching towards the light and life.This, My Second Life by Patrick Charnley is published by Hutchinson Heinemann (£16.99).

But the statistic is correct: while the Milky Way isestimatedto have roughly 200bn stars, Russia has something in the region of642bntrees. Stretching from the Arctic tundra to central Asia to the Pacific Ocean, the Russian forest is vast, mighty and inhospitable. Yet while it is a source of potential danger, it is also a place of great beauty and potential riches, providing furs, minerals and rivers overflowing with salmon.Pinkham, a professor of comparative literature at Cornell University whose last book explored the intricacies of post-Soviet Ukraine, here charts the landscape’s influence on the Russian psyche, and its imprint on history, society and literature. The forest is deeply entwined with Russian national identity – the country is often symbolically represented as a bear – yet attitudes towards it have fluctuated. Different leaders have proposed different strategies for extracting value from the land, leading to cycles of deforestation and tree-planting depending on whether the priority was boosting agriculture, building Peter the Great’s imperial fleet, extracting minerals or constructing hydroelectric dams. Politically, it has been a place of resistance and of ultranationalist rhetoric glorifying the idea of Russian self-sufficiency.As well as being an ideological battleground, the forest in Russia has frequently been a literal one. From the 13th-century Mongol invasion of Kievan Rus to the current conflict in Ukraine, military success or defeat has often depended on an understanding of the forest, whether to aid in tracking enemy combatants or to avoid detection. During the second world war, partisan fighters “found their greatest ally in the forests”: they hid in the trees and sabotaged German supply lines, while helping an estimated 25,000 Jewish people escape into the woods.The forest always offers some combination of nourishment and danger, freedom and entrapmentAs we learned in Richard Powers’ tree-centred novel The Overstory, a forest will inevitably end up being partly defined by the people who pass through it. Pinkham gives a comprehensive account of the ways writers, poets and artists have looked to the forest for meaning: Pushkin’s romanticised visions of mountain societies in the Caucasus; Tolstoy’s forest-inspired epiphanies (on encountering an oak in War and Peace, Prince Andrei “realises that he should live more like a forest – in inter­connection with all the beings around him, giving and receiving”); Andrei Tarkovsky’s cinematic depictions of spectral, quasi-divine trees. In the mid-1800s, writers and intellectuals devoted themselves to protesting deforestation and emancipating the serfs, two causes that became closely interlinked.Colourful characters abound, from the heavily tattooed environmental activist Andrei Khristoforov, who wore angel wings and self-identified as a tree, to the Lykov family, members of a religious sect who lived undetected in the taiga for decades, gaining notoriety after their existence was revealed. In 2004, an elderly man in Novgorod oblast erected a monument to the potato, which saved many Russians from starvation during the economic deprivation of the 1990s. The customs of indigenous populations, such as the Khanty people’s ceremonies that involve skinning a bear, are recounted sensitively and with respect.Pinker’s prose is spare, precise, becoming more evocative in passages about flora and fauna. Her love of animals is evident in her descriptions of them: a lynx “danc[es] on the edge of [a] motorboat, his tufted ears moving in response to the sounds of the water and the rustling trees”; wolf cubs are “skinny, big-eyed, and innocent … nibbling leaves and bark and each other”. The forest murmurs, sings, makes music, whispers.Like the taiga, the book’s structure is somewhat sprawling. While the order is broadly chronological and geographical, some of the jumps can be jarring, especially in the early sections (lyrical chapter titles such as Tigers Listen to Water Talk don’t shed much light on the matter). This is a meander through the woods, rather than a straight path. There is at times an excess of places and names, though an extensive knowledge of Russian history isn’t a prerequisite. By its nature, the narrative ends up being somewhat repetitive: the forest offers some combination of nourishment and danger, freedom and entrapment.Overall, the book makes a compelling argument for the forest as a prism through which to understand Russia – including the former Soviet space – and its peoples. The climate crisis looms ominously: a 2021 wildfire burned an area twice the size of Ireland. But the forest is remarkably resilient, whether to war or human interference or nuclear disaster (in the Chornobyl “zone of exclusion”, a natural rewilding has occurred, bringing with it bison, lynx and bears). It may be a mistake, Pinkham suggests, to apply a human timeframe to this ecosystem; an oak can live for more than 1,000 years, outlasting any despotic dynasty. “Do you know how many Putins there have been in our time?” one activist says. “Go into the woods, hide, don’t stick your head out, and wait.”The Oak and the Larch: A Forest History of Russia and Its Empires by Sophie Pinkham is published by William Collins (£25).

Sign up hereKeza MacDonaldWed 7 Jan 2026 10.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 7 Jan 2026 10.02 ESTShareIt had begun to feel like an endurance test by the end, but nonetheless, like the sucker I am, I watched theStranger Thingsfinale last week. Andspoiler warning: I’m going to talk about it in general terms in this newsletter. Because approximately 80% of the final season comprised twentysomething “teenagers” explaining things to each other while using random 1980s objects to illustrate convoluted plans and plot points, my expectations were not high. After an interminable hour, finally, something fun happens, as the not-kids arm themselves with machine guns and molotovs and face off against a monstrously gigantic demon-crab. Aha, I thought – the final boss battle!The fight was like something out of Monster Hunter, all scale and spectacle with a touch of desperation. For a very long time, video games sought to imitate cinema. Now cinema (and TV) often feels like a video game. The structure of Stranger Things’ final season reminded me a lot of Resident Evil: long periods of walking slowly through corridors, with characters exchanging plot information aloud on their way to the action, and occasional explosions of gunfire, screeching monsters or car chases. Those long periods of relative inaction are much more tolerable when you’ve got a controller in your hands. I am all for TV and film embracing the excitement, spectacle and dynamism of video games, but do they have to embrace the unnecessary side-quests and open-world bloat, too?The reciprocally influential relationship between games, TV and film has developed a lot in the last few years. Ageneration of gen X and elder-millennial gamers have recently aged into creative and commissioning power in these industries. That’s why we’re getting people such as Jonathan Nolan heading up an excellentFallout TV show, and indeed why all video-game-to-screen adaptations have become dramatically less terrible in the past five years or so. It also inevitably means that the boundaries between interactive and non-interactive entertainment are becoming more porous: where previously game-makers were heavily influenced by film (primarily but notexclusively Alien/s and Star Wars), now that relationship works both ways. Most Marvel movies look and feel like a video game to me, and not just because they’re all full of computer-generated graphics. It’s the mood and pace of them.View image in fullscreenAnyone for Halo? … Emily Blunt in 2014 movie Edge of Tomorrow.Photograph: David James/Warner Bros/AllstarEdge of Tomorrow remains the most video-game-ish movie I’ve ever seen: its premise revolves around dying and respawning, trying out different things on each run. It’s a sci-fi roguelike of a film. I wanted to playMad Max: Fury Roadthe entire time I was watching it, and John Wick 4 was literally a fighting-game boss rush. When film critics say that a film feels like a video game, they often mean it disparagingly; a lot of cinephiles still see games as the lower form. When I say a movie feels like a video game, it’s a compliment – unless it feels like aboringvideo game.This was the problem, for me, with Stranger Things: every episode felt like loading up an open-world game that I hadn’t played for a few months. More and more characters kept appearing, and I didn’t remember or care who most of them were. Between the Upside Down, Vecna’s mindscape, real-world Hawkins and an entirely new dimension introduced in the last couple of episodes, there were too many locations to keep track of. Every episode brought on the mild despair I feel when I think I’m near the end of an overlong game, only to discover yet another entirely new area to explore. The painfully long epilogue, meanwhile, was rivalled only by Red Dead Redemption 2’s interminable post-game hours. Please, just let it end already!Of course, in modern pop culture, nothing is ever allowed to end properly, not if it’s still making money. I’m surprised there’s been no word of an official Stranger Things video game tie-in (outside of a retro-style smartphone beat-em-up from 2019). Come to think of it, we don’t see many of these kinds of licensed games any more: back in the 00s and 2010s, most major movies and TV shows launched with an interactive accompaniment. Presumably this is because of the spiralling cost of game development – you can’t knock out a mediocrePlayStation2 game in nine months any more – but also, when TV shows feel so much like games, do we really need an adaptation anyway?What to playView image in fullscreenStrange and surreal … Indika.Photograph: Odd MeterThe first game I’ve finished in 2026 isIndika, a surreal and mildly horrible game about a young nun questioning her faith and having conversations with the devil as she goes on an extremely strange journey through bleak, snow-covered villages and abandoned factories with an escaped convict. There are much-needed flashes of humour in here, but also stuff about religion, control and sexuality that I haven’t seen in a video game before. It’s also part of a small wave of games (see Baby Steps) that mocks gamer mentality: there are points, but they are pointless; explore off the beaten path and you will find something useless and inconsequential rather than a secret or something fun. And that’s if you find anything at all.Available on:PC, PS5, Xbox, Nintendo SwitchEstimated playtime:five hoursWhat to readView image in fullscreenInnovator … Sega’s David Rosen, who died in December.Photograph: American Amusement Machine AssociationDavid Rosen, the co-founder of Sega and an influential figure in the history of arcade video games, died on Christmas Day at 95.

According to data from Circana, the top five most played games on PlayStation 5 this year were exactly the same as last year:Fortnite,Call of Duty,Grand Theft Auto 5(including Online),RobloxandMinecraft. All of these games are five to 10-plus years old. This stagnation at the top is why every big publisher has spent millions in the last decade trying to create live-service games, and why most of them have flopped. Last year on Steam, meanwhile, only 14% of all playtime was spent on new games released in 2025. Any developer releasing something new, be they blockbuster or indie, is competing for a sliver of a sliver of players’ time and money. These stats explain a lot about why the games industry is where it is right now, and why there’s such a bleak mood among many developers.Explore more on these topicsGamesPushing Buttons newsletterStranger ThingsMad Max: Fury RoadEdge of TomorrowTelevisionPlayStationfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Tosser’s Pot leads to Cutpurse, then from Pokes Alley to Kiphouse Row. For the residents of the inner-city tenement building where the action opens in 1880, choices are starkly circumscribed and lives are cut short by poverty, disease or violence.Covering 100 years of life in this house, the narrative traces four families, their lives intertwined through generations, with trauma recurring – to women in particular – echoing the spirit of Seán O’Casey. The historical backdrop is outlined in broad brush: from strikes in the slums to revolution and war, through the early years of the independent state, to the heroin and HIV-Aids crises of the 1980s.Bergin creates a thread through time in the character of the spirited Honor Gately (Sarah Morris), a sex worker determined to defy her circumstances as “a feculent wench”, whose great-granddaughter, also played compellingly by Morris, breaks old patterns and starts to write a novel.View image in fullscreenLives intertwined through generations … Dublin Gothic.Photograph: Ros KavanaghHonor’s “blubberpus” son (Thommas Kane Byrne) brings gleeful comedy to the role of an accidental patriot in the 1916 Easter Rising. His is one of a number of historical characters conflated by Bergin to pointedly anti-heroic effect: we meet loosely emblematic incarnations of James Joyce, Pádraig Pearse and Brendan Behan, as well as a Bob Geldof/Bono-like singer. A rogues’ gallery of abusive, duplicitous or pathetic men – politicians, priests, wastrel writers – flashes past, with subtlety sacrificed to narrative momentum.With a dynamic ensemble cast of 19 on stage throughout, the storytelling is elaborate, expansive – and sometimes smothering. Functioning as a constantly shifting chorus taking turns to narrate the plot, the multitalented actors are in a whirlwind of exposition and costume changes, playing more than 120 characters in three-and-a-half hours.With so much narrative to cram in, the form often hampers the scope for director Caroline Byrne to do more than manoeuvre the cast around Jamie Vartan’s imposing set. Creating a cross-section of the building, the stacked design offers dramatic possibilities, not fully realised. Despite the ambitious scale, commitment and punchy energy of this production, its teeming canvas leaves little room for new insights.AtAbbey theatre, Dublin, until 31 JanuaryExplore more on these topicsTheatreAbbey theatreIrelandreviewsShareReuse this content"

But with a record box office camerecord ticket prices, as Hollywood stars from Denzel Washington to George Clooney commanded sums pushing four figures for orchestra seating. This year feels relatively less Hollywood-y, though no less starry, with a healthy mix of revivals, new material and buzzy transfers on the calendar. Here are 12 of the most anticipated Broadway shows in 2026.BugBroadway kicks off the season with a bang – or, well, a bug – with Tracy Letts’s 1996 cult classic, which began previews just before the new year and officially opens on 8 January. The new production, directed by David Cromer after an acclaimed run at Chicago’s Steppenwolf theatre in 2021, reunites The White Lotus star (and Letts’s partner) Carrie Coon with Pass Over’s Namir Smallwood as two unexpected lovers – a lonely waitress and a mysterious drifter – whose motel room tryst devolves into something darker. With extremely strong word-of-mouth buzz and the arguably never-more-relevant theme of creeping paranoia, expect many to catch the bug this winter.Death of a SalesmanBroadway is never short of starry revivals, and arguably this year’s starriest is Nathan Lane’s take on ill-fated businessman Willy Loman in Arthur Miller’s mid-century classic Death of a Salesman. The Broadway stalwart will appear alongside Laurie Metcalf and Girls’s Christopher Abbott in a production helmed by Joe Mantello, who most recently directed Metcalf in an acclaimed run of Samuel Hunter’s similarly disillusioned play Little Bear Ridge Road. Opening in April, this will be the sixth revival of the Pulitzer-winning portrait of failed American dreams, which almost always attracts Broadway heavyweights; previous versions starred Wendell Pierce, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Dustin Hoffman, George C Scott and Brian Dennehy.GiantView image in fullscreenJohn Lithgow.Photograph: Manuel HarlanIn keeping with the theme of turning to the past to speak to the present, Giant, starring John Lithgow as the famously irascible children’s author Roald Dahl, enters the superheated conversations around Israel, Palestine and antisemitism via a scandalous episode in the late writer’s life. The critically acclaimed play, which picked up three Olivier awards in its recent West End run before transferring to New York, blends fact with fiction in the fallout of an explosive book review Dahl wrote in the early 1980s, criticizing Israel’s invasion of Lebanon in language some deemed antisemitic. As his friends, colleagues and an American Jewish sales executive war-room the controversy, the play touches on several third rails of many a dinner party. Toquotethe Guardian’s Arifa Akbar: “This is what theatre is for.”Every Brilliant ThingThe Broadway lovefest continues for Daniel Radcliffe – less than two years after taking home the Tony for his role in the beloved revival of Stephen Sondheim’s Merrily We Roll Along, the Harry Potter starreturnsto the New York stage this spring (sans music) with Every Brilliant Thing, a one-person show that grapples with depression via a flurry of hopeful lists. The show, written by Duncan Macmillan and originally starring Jonny Donahoe, has become aninternational hitover the decade since its debut at the Edinburgh fringe festival; it was most recently performed in London by a rotating cast of actors including Minnie Driver, Ambika Mod and Lenny Henry, handling material inspiring enough to, at least in his telling, coax Radcliffe out of his planned Broadway hiatus.Becky ShawFor those looking for some bite, Becky Shaw, a razor-sharp dark comedy about a blind date gone horribly awry, begins performances in March with a cast including Alden Ehrenreich, Linda Emond and Patrick Ball (AKA The Pitt’s Dr Frank Langdon). Gina Gionfriddo’s 2008 play of bad manners, bad sex and one unplanned trip to the police station – amid a thorny tangle of class, gender and relationship dynamics – drew rave reviews at its off-Broadway premiere in 2009. Presumably, some updates have been made for the age of dating apps.Dog Day AfternoonView image in fullscreenEbon Moss-Bachrach and Jon Bernthal.Photograph: Warner Bros Theatre VenturesThe boys are back: The Bear’s Mikey Berzatto (Jon Bernthal) and Cousin Richie (Ebon Moss-Bachrach) reunite in March for Dog Day Afternoon, the true story of a 1972 Brooklyn bank robbery immortalized in the 1975 film starring Al Pacino and John Cazale, and adapted for the stage for the first time by Pulitzer-winning author Stephen Adly Guirgis. Bernthal, no stranger to playing an action hero or criminal (or both), and Moss-Bachrach, who deservedly garnered multiple awards for his live-wire performance of the frenetic restaurant manager, should have no issue letting it rip in a story of the chaos that happens “when passion and desperation collide”.ProofAlso making her Broadway debut this spring: Bernthal and Moss-Bachrach’s The Bear co-star Ayo Edebiri, who will co-lead the first Broadway revival of David Auburn’s Tony and Pulitzer award winning play alongside Don Cheadle. After the mixed results ofAfter the Hunt, the Emmy winner and comedian continues to explore more dramatic roles as a young woman in Chicago grappling with her father’s legacy as a brilliant but troubled mathematician, in a production helmed by Hamilton director (and Michelle Williams’s spouse) Thomas Kail.TitaniqueIn huge news for those unfortunate enough to miss Titanique during its buzzy off-Broadway run, this delightfully kooky riff on the beloved 1997 film, which doubles as an appropriately kooky revue of Céline Dion’s music, finally returns to New York after an acclaimed run abroad (including a recent Olivier award for best entertainment or comedy). Who better to the (re)tell the story of Jack and Rose than the Quebecois queen of feelings? Or, more accurately, show creator Marla Mindelle, who returns for the Broadway debut to sing Dion’s unparalleled catalog of maximalist ballads.Fallen AngelsView image in fullscreenRose Byrne.Photograph: Javier Rojas/PI/Zuma Press Wire/ShutterstockIn 1925, English playwright Noël Coward caused a mild moral panic with his play Fallen Angels, in which two upper-class women toast to their premarital sexual dalliances with the same man. The risque play drew a rebuke from the theater censor office of the Lord Chamberlain (he eventually relented, on the grounds of farcical comedy, after a personal intervention). A century later, the fizzy scandal makes for rich material forRose Byrneand Kelli O’Hara, who will play the two conspiratorial women (whose husbands are away for the day!) in Scott Ellis’s revival of Coward’s groundbreaking comedy, opening in March at the Todd Haimes theatre.Narnia!

The country icon, now 79, penned the book (along with Maria S Schlatter) for this tribute musical, which traces her legendary rags-to-riches story from childhood poverty in the Smoky Mountains of east Tennessee to the Grand Ole Opry to Hollywood. Directed by Broadway veteran Bartlett Sher with a premiere date to be announced, the so-called true original musical will feature many of her top hits, including Jolene, I Will Always Love You, Coat of Many Colors and 9 to5, as well as new songs by Parton herself.Explore more on these topics2026 culture previewBroadwayUS theaterTheatreDaniel RadcliffeDolly PartonNoel CowardfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Few are identifiable by a single exclamation alone. Among the exceptions are Lady Bracknell in The Importance of Being Earnest (“A handbag?”) and the venal Maryland state senator Clay Davis, who appeared in all five series of the acclaimed US crime dramaThe Wirebetween 2002 and 2008.Senator Davis, played by Isiah Whitlock Jr, who has died aged 71, was notable for his unique pronunciation of a monosyllabic expletive. On his lips, its central vowel was bent out of shape and stretched as thin as pizza dough: “Sheee-it”.David Simon created The Wire but it was Whitlock who originated that word’s distinctive delivery. It was a hangover from his performance in Spike Lee’s25th Hour(2002). Whitlock played the DEA (Drug Enforcement Administration) agent Amos Flood, who utters the elongated word after retrieving cash and drugs stowed inside a suspect’s sofa.It became an in-joke or call-back in his later performances as Flood in Lee’s filmsShe Hate Me(2004) andRed Hook Summer(2012). In the latter, which found the character seemingly demoted to precinct detective, he gave what Slate called “arguably the longest, richest sheee-it to date”. It earned yet another reprise in Lee’sBlacKkKlansman(2018).In each instance, the actor delivered the word in a sly, incredulous rumble. The exact pronunciation was borrowed from an uncle.Senator Davis, initially a minor character in The Wire, featured so sporadically in the first two seasons that Whitlock initially turned down the offer to return for the third one. “I was doing Othello in Alabama, and I said, ‘No, I can’t be bothered. I’m not gonna go’ … They finally convinced me to because David Simon pulled me aside and said, ‘We’ve got this whole storyline set up where you’re going to be ripping off the drug dealers.’”Simon, who claimed not to have seen 25th Hour until several years after The Wire premiered, was fuzzy about how “sheee-it” found its way into the series. “Maybe it started with [Whitlock], but I think we heard the southern drawl in his tone and went with it,” he said.Whatever its beginnings, there seemed no end to it. Fans never tired of saluting Whitlock with mimicry, though he took some pride in the fact that he wasn’t as imitable as people thought. “They don’t quite do it the way I do it. They kind of butcher it.” After The Wire ended, he said: “What have I done? I’ve unleashed a monster.”He could hardly complain once he launched in 2015 his own line ofBobbleheadlookalike dolls which spoke the relevant word at the touch of a button. More than 10,000 were sold.At times, the gimmick was in danger of overshadowing the work of this subtle, perspicacious actor. Whitlock had a special gift for exploring moral ambiguity, whether in comedies such as Armando Iannucci’s spiky television sitcomVeep, in which he starred between 2013 and 2015 as a defence secretary with ill-judged presidential ambitions, or in stage dramas, including Christopher Shinn’s Four, where he was a married teacher on a date with a 16-year-old boy.View image in fullscreenIsiah Whitlock Jr in New York last year. Achieving recognition in middle-age with The Wire vindicated him in his decision to play the long game. ‘I waited for the landscape to change,’ he said.Photograph: John Nacion/FilmMagic“On the page, this guy could be a monster,” said Jeff Cohen, who directed him in the play at the Tribeca Playhouse in New York in 2001. “You want to hate him, but you don’t because Isiah makes this character so immediate... It’s like he’s 18 and at the prom. You see his vulnerability.”Whitlock doubted whether he could play outright villains but conceded that grey areas were his stock-in-trade. “A little shady? Yeah, I can handle that.”He was born in South Bend,Indiana, the fifth of 11 children, to Isiah Sr, a steel mill worker by night who carried out house clearances by day, and Ruth (nee Moore), who worked in health care. He attended Southwest Minnesota State University on a sports scholarship, intending to become a football player until a string of injuries led him to reconsider. Stopping by the university’s theatre department, he found auditions for The Crucible were underway. “I’ve been working ever since,” he said in 2021.Whitlock attended a summer programme at the American Conservatory theatre (ACT) in San Francisco. After finishing university, he returned to study there and to perform with the company. He spent four years in total at ACT, where Denzel Washington and Delroy Lindo were a few years behind him, then moved to New York. In 1989, he starred onBroadwayin The Merchant of Venice with Dustin Hoffman.Alongside frequent TV appearances, he had small roles in Martin Scorsese’s Goodfellas (1990), Woody Allen’s Everyone Says I Love You (1996) and David Mamet’s The Spanish Prisoner (1997).He appeared on 10 occasions, as different characters, across the various iterations of the Law and Order television franchise. He starred in the first season of one spin-off, Law and Order: Criminal Intent, in 2001, only to be summoned a decade later to reprise his role on the finale. “The squalid part of this story is that I was still available after 10 years,” he said.Lee was the director to whom he returned most often, starring inChi-Raq(2015), a lively transposing of Aristophenes’s Lysistrata to modern-day Chicago, and the 2017 television version of Lee’s 1986 filmShe’s Gotta Have It.His biggest role for Lee was inDa 5 Bloods(2020), in which he teamed up with his Wire co-star Clarke Peters and his fellow ACT alumnus Lindo to play Vietnam veterans. They return to the country decades after the war to retrieve the remains of their fallen sergeant as well as the gold they stashed there back in the day.He made guest appearances in two episodes each of the well-regarded television comedies Louie (2012) and Atlanta (2016 and 2022). In two seasons ofYour Honor(2020-23), he was the best friend of a judge (Bryan Cranston) whose son is responsible for a hit-and-run accident.As well as playing a sheriff in a remake of the Disney adventurePete’s Dragon(2016), Whitlock did voice work on several Disney-Pixar releases:Cars 3(2017), the Toy Story prequelLightyear(2022) and the forthcoming Hoppers (2026).Achieving recognition in middle-age with The Wire vindicated him in his decision to play the long game, working diligently and trusting that it would pay off creatively. “I waited for the landscape to change,” he said. “And when the landscape changed, I was still there.”Whitlock is survived by four sisters.Isiah Whitlock Jr, actor, born 13 September 1954; died 30 December 2025Explore more on these topicsThe WireUS televisionSpike LeeToysVeepIndianaBroadwayobituariesShareReuse this content"

He was a populist pioneer and genuine visionary who created London’s Young Vic theatre from scratch, radically changed the nature of the Edinburgh festival and, at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, tried to introduce institutional permanence to New York theatre. He was also a figure of bustling energy. Even in his 90s, when I would see him on his annual return to Edinburgh, he would be talking about future projects. In fact, he reminded me of a line from a great Latin poet: “Leisure, Catullus, does not agree with you.”TheYoung Vicis his enduring legacy but one forgets what an extraordinary achievement it was in 1970. It was a breeze block building created in nine months out of a former butcher’s shop, and was inspired by Dunlop’s memories of the postwar dream of a theatre centre operating under the auspices of the Old Vic. Dunlop’s Young Vic had a similar relation to Olivier’s National Theatre parent company, but it soon established its own identity. Offering lively productions to young audiences at affordable prices, it mixed classics by Shakespeare and Molière with the best of Beckett, Ionesco and Genet.View image in fullscreenDunlop with the Who’s Pete Townshend in 1971.Photograph: Evening Standard/Getty ImagesNicky Henson, a key member of Dunlop’s team and a fine Jimmy Porter in Look Back in Anger, once told me that the Young Vic company was essentially Dunlop’s surrogate family. I saw the truth of that a few years ago when I got a call from him inviting me to a tea party in Soho to mark a significant Young Vic anniversary. Around the table were original members of the company includingRonald Pickup, Andrew Robertson,Cleo Sylvestre, Anna Carteret and Annabel Leventon. Quite spontaneously people would get up and tell stories of the Young Vic in its early days. Ron Pickup, who had played Oedipus, recalled Olivier coming to see it and telling him afterwards: “Ron, you are a highly promising young actor playing the lead in one of the greatest plays in world drama in the most beautiful new theatre in London. So why the fuck couldn’t I understand a word you were saying?” As Ron told this self-deprecating story, Frank chuckled in the corner like an affectionate father.Because he was such an innovator, one forgets  he was also a very good directorDunlop went on to run the Edinburgh festival from 1984 to 1991, and totally altered its character. Under previous directors, drama had always been a poor relation of classical music and opera, but Frank reversed the roles. He gave us a series of international theatre seasons including visits from Sweden’s Ingmar Bergman, Poland’s Andrzej Wajda, Spain’s Victor Garcia and Germany’s Manfred Wekwerth and Joachim Tenschert. But perhaps his greatest coup, aided by Thelma Holt, was to introduce the Japanese masterYukio Ninagawato British audiences. I still rate his cherry-blossom Macbeth as one of the most beautiful productions I’ve ever seen, but it was followed by Ninagawa’s equally striking productions of Medea, The Tempest and a contemporary play, Tango at the End of Winter.Dunlop was more diplomatic with visiting companies than with local politicians, and caused fury with the council when the idea of alternating the festival between Glasgow and Edinburgh was seriously mooted. But for a journalist, he was always good copy – not least when publicly suggesting that the fringe had become “smug and self-satisfied”.View image in fullscreenDirecting Jim Dale in his breakthrough role in Scapino in 1971.Photograph: Evening Standard/Getty ImagesBecause he was such an innovator, one forgets that he was also a very good director, and two of his productions reveal his capacity for nursing great performances into being. In 1971, while working for the NationalTheatrecompany at the Old Vic, he directed Carl Zuckmayer’s picaresque fable The Captain of Köpenick, which shows a former prisoner acquiring a new persona the second he dons a soldier’s uniform. The play got a great performance from Paul Scofield, whose slack-jointed knees looked as if they could barely support the fragile load they were asked to carry, but it was Dunlop who provided the essential framework.In 1974 John Wood gave a similarly virtuosic performance in an RSC Sherlock Holmes, but again it was Dunlop who caught the unabashed theatrical vigour of William Gillette’s close-shaven adaptation of Conan Doyle.There were many other aspects to Dunlop’s varied career: he was the original director of Joseph and the Amazing Technicolour Dreamcoat, the creator of Pop Theatre for whom he staged The Winter’s Tale and The Trojan Women, the man who turned Jim Dale into a Broadway star in Scapino, and who later directed Delphine Seyrig in Antony and Cleopatra. Because of his restless energy and reluctance to stay too long in one place – rather like a modern-day Tyrone Guthrie – Dunlop was undervalued, but if only for the creation of the Young Vic he would demand a permanent place in theatrical history.Explore more on these topicsTheatreYoung VicfeaturesShareReuse this content"

At the same time there was a slight decrease in the amount of films released: 1,092 in 2025, compared with 1,124 in 2024.The result is the highest total since 2019, which saw £1.35bn in total revenue, shortly before the collapse of the physical cinema box office the following year, to £323.7m, as Covid restrictions hit hard. Cinema revenues recovered to £595.5m in 2021, and £980.7m in 2022, only returning above £1bn in 2023, with a total of £1.06bn.The numbers of films on release suggest that the production pipeline, hit both by the pandemic and subsequent film industry strikes in 2023, has recovered, and is in fact exceeding pre-pandemic levels; in 2019, 938 films were released. Significantly however, a recalibration of strategy appears to be occurring, with 224 films recorded in 2025 as “saturation” releases (ie playing in over 250 venues simultaneously), compared with 200 in 2024 and 188 in 2019. According to Comscore, Downton Abbey: The Grand Finale had the widest opening in the UK in 2025, with over 750 cinemas.The highest grossing film of 2025 in the UK and Ireland was gaming adaptation A Minecraft Movie, whose viral impactincluding the “chicken jockey” scene, has translated into box office supremacy, with a total of £56.88m. The filmalso topped the 2025 North American box office, taking $423.9m, but only came in fifth at the worldwide box office with $958.3m – well behind the global leader,Chinese animation Ne Zha 2, whichreported returns of $2.24bn.Of British productions, the fourth Bridget Jones film, subtitled Mad About the Boy, finished the year as the most successful at the UK and Irish box office, taking £46.4m and coming well ahead of Downton Abbey: The Grand Finale and 28 Years Later in second and third place, with £18.4m and £15.6m respectively.The figures also revealed the continuing strength of “event cinema” releases which took a total of £44m (4.1% of the total), and which included 10 films taking more than £1m. Among these was the best ever performance for a stage production; the film of West End production Six the Musical amassed £6.2m – although this is well short of the record “event cinema” total of £12.3m for Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour in 2023.Phil Clapp, chief executive of the UK Cinema Association said: “Although it saw only a small year-on-year increase in box office, 2025 undoubtedly marked a significant further step in the sector’s recovery following the challenges of recent years. There is great optimism that the coming months will see significant further progress.”Explore more on these topicsFilmFilm industryA Minecraft MovienewsShareReuse this content"

Then he waited.Read more summer essentialsSteve MinOnWed 7 Jan 2026 09.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 7 Jan 2026 18.07 ESTShareWhile day-drinking ouzo in a spiderwebbed taverna on the Greek island of Paros, I decided to write a coming-out letter to my parents. I sealed it in a surface mail envelope, moistened a ΕΛΛΗΝΙΚΗ ΔΗΜΟΚΡΑΤΙΑ (Hellenic Republic) stamp with my aniseed tongue and posted it.It was the 1990s and I had only just relocated from Australia to London with Nick, my boyfriend at the time, and Julie, a good mate. We had gone across to Greece for a holiday, island-hopping, catching ferries on a whim, knowing nothing about the places we were visiting except that backpacking there was cheap.The place that stayed with me: Victoria’s far east coast was our endless summer home, until the night the campground burned | Kate MildenhallRead moreAt ferry stops, homestay hagglers hustled us into their cars. They drove us to remote domatia, where we slept on crisp white bedsheets that had been washed then draped to dry over fragrant hedges of rosemary. We ambled down dirt tracks and spoke to goats. Broke into village chapels with the entitlement of curious Australians abroad.I turned 30 there and, in an outpouring of camp, I sang Judy Garland’s I Don’t Care, dancing on a weed-girt chunk of granite, part of a fallen ruin. But I was lying, I did care because back home in Australia I had always adopted the shape of my parents’ ideal: their hetero son. After drinking a half bottle of ouzo, I resolved to kill him off.As my coming-out letter steamed across the Aegean on a ferry to Athens, regret sailed into my sleep. I had nightmares of parricide.The island was beautiful but a cancerous reservation undermined my enjoyment of it. I started to notice how the esplanades were splattered with ink from caught octopus, slapped and tenderised to death on the concrete. How the shallows were booby trapped with spiky sea urchins. How used condoms were more plentiful than jellyfish.I fantasised that the yiayias were commissioned by my parents to conjure the son that I didn’t want to be any more.Departing Paros for the queer mecca of Mykonos, I hoped I could be guiltlessly gay. Half-naked on beaches full of men. But at a bar festooned with fishing nets and neon floats, I found myself cornered by a group of old Greek women. They wanted to dance. Not to Kylie or Madonna but to the hetero anthems of Springsteen.I was coerced to do the sort of moves that children do with their parents at weddings, holding hands and pulling back and forth, like robots sawing wood. I fantasised that the yiayias were commissioned by my parents to conjure the son that I didn’t want to be any more. The good boy. The liar.After Mikonos, we sailed to Naxos, Ios, Santorini. On Folegandros, we stayed in a villa on a beach, down a path presided over by a sarcastic-eyed donkey. We drank cheap retsina and barbecued sardines at night.Unable to sleep, I turned to night writing: the beginnings of a novel about two closeted boys from an oppressive Salt Lake City chapter of the Mormon church on a foreign posting to Australia, where they fall in love. It was a flawed, didactic projection of what I’d hoped to achieve by escaping to the northern hemisphere.Three weeks after I sent my letter, I found a payphone in Folegandros to make a call to my sister.“Are mum and dad alright?”“Yes. Why?”“Did they get a letter from me?”“Not that I know of.”Spooked, I contacted a flatmate in London who was checking my mail. A letter had arrived for me. Not from my parents, it was a job offer from an ad agency in Brisbane, an offer too good to refuse. Or that’s what I told Nick and Julie.View image in fullscreen‘Now, when I look back at Paros … I’m reminded of the letter I sent from there, to my parents’: author Steve MinOn.Photograph: Chris CrawfordReally, I wanted to fly home, to intercept my Trojan letter, before my parents brought it in from their post box and opened the damned thing at their kitchen table.I arrived home too late.My mother, who opened the letter alone, had already concreted over her feelings. My words, though alcoholically composed, were beyond her limit. She didn’t want to speak about me being gay. She didn’t want me to tell my father either.Now, when I look back at Paros, I’m reminded not of the colour of the Aegean, or the fragrant bedsheets or the goats. I’m reminded of the letter I sent from there, to my parents. What writing a letter like that had meant. It was a symbol of the distance between them and me. A symbol of my naivety too.

Five creative ways to make 2026 happier, healthier and more hopefulEngaging increativity can reduce depression, improve immunity and delay ageing – all while you’re having funDaisy FancourtWed 7 Jan 2026 00.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 7 Jan 2026 13.47 ESTShareFor some reason, we have collectively agreed that new year is the time to reinvent ourselves. The problem, for many people, is that we’ve tried all the usual health kicks – running, yoga, meditation, the latest diets – even if we haven’t really enjoyed them, in a bid to improve our minds and bodies. But have any of us given as much thought to creativity? Allow me to suggest that this year be a time to embrace the arts.Ever since our Paleolithic ancestors began painting caves, carving figurines, dancing and singing, engaging in the arts has been interwoven with health and healing. Look through the early writings of every major medical tradition around the world and you find the arts. What is much newer – and rapidly accelerating over the past two decades – is a blossoming scientific evidence-base identifying and quantifying exactly what the health benefits of the arts are.Randomised trials on the mental health benefits of the arts now number in triple figures, with regular singing, dancing, reading, crafts, and cultural pursuits shown to reduce symptoms of anxiety, depression and stress for people of all ages.Some studiessuggest that combining creative arts therapies such as music therapy with antidepressants and counselling can nearly double the improvements in depressive symptoms compared with standard treatments alone. But the arts can also be beneficial preventatively. People who regularly go to the theatre, live music events, museums, galleries and the cinema havenearly half the risk of developing depression. This is not merely because such people tend to be wealthier or healthier or engaged in other health-promoting behaviours. It’s actually independent of socio-demographic characteristics, lifestyle and even genetics.People who regularly go to the theatre, live music, museums or galleries have nearly half the risk of depressionInstead, neuroscience research and psychological experiments have revealed that when we engage in the arts, we give our brains what theywantto be happy – we activate the same pleasure and reward networks in the brain that are activated by food, sex and drugs, and we experience the benefits of hormones such as dopamine that improve our mood. We also give our brains what weneed– dancing, singing, crafting and writing help fulfil core psychological needs that are the building blocks of our mental health, such as autonomy, control and a sense of mastery. Crucially, the arts give us an effective way to regulate our emotions – calming or invigorating us as the situation demands, which helps us buffer and deal with life stresses more effectively.For our brains, the arts are a very efficient workout, engaging diverse regions involved in sensory processing, memory, movement, pattern recognition and emotions (among others). Over time, regular arts engagement can strengthen connectivity between brain regions and even increase the volume of grey matter. In fact, amateur musicians and artists have stronger connections between parts of the brain that are vulnerable to ageing, and areidentifiable in brain images as “younger”.View image in fullscreenGoing to cultural events such as concerts builds ‘cognitive reserve’.Photograph: Posed by models; Maki Nakamura/Getty ImagesParticipating in arts, crafts, reading, playing musical instruments and going to cultural events and performances builds what is known as “cognitive reserve”: the resilience of the brain against cognitive decline. So even if we start to develop the pathological indications of dementia, our brains cancompensate for longer. In fact, even when we’ve taken lifestyle and personal characteristics into account, people who are regularly engaged in cultural activities perform better on cognitive tests as they age, showing slower rates of decline in ability and alower risk of developing dementia, and they are on average older if and when they do get that diagnosis than people who aren’t engaged in the arts.For our bodies, there is no physiological system the arts do not affect. When we breathe deeply for an activity such as singing, we improve the strength of our respiratory muscles, giving our lungs thesame level of workoutas a brisk walk. When we dance, we can experience decreases in blood pressure and glucose levels – improvements that are stronger than if we do similar exercises without the creative element of dance. Arts engagement improves immune activity, lowering levels of inflammation that influence both our physicaland mental health. Studies just emerging even indicate that arts engagement influences gene expression, with people showing patterns of gene expression (known as “epigenetic clocks”) that areyounger than those of people who don’t engagein the arts. Whether we’re keeping our fingers nimble with crochet, our bodies fit through dance, or keeping ourselves active by going to gigs and cultural venues, engaging with the arts reduces our risks of developing chronic pain, physical impairments and frailty – even when other health behaviours such as exercise have already been taken into account –extending our “healthspan”.The arts can activate the same reward networks in the brain as food and sexI want to be clear – the arts are not a panacea. In fact, there are examples of the arts doing more harm than good, from loud music andsurrealist artbeing used as a means of torture for prisoners,to art being used as a way to flaunt wealth and power within society. But it’s not an exaggeration to say that the arts could save your life. Over the years I’ve met a number of people who have told me stories of how painting, reading, dancing or acting became the lifeline that got them through seemingly impossible times.I bet if a new drug came on the market offering the same catalogue of benefits as the arts, most people would want to take it. Instead, many of us see engaging in the arts as a luxury rather than a necessity. Even though they may be exactly what we need to improve our health and wellbeing.So I invite you to be brutally honest with yourself. How many minutes did you spend actively engaging in the arts yesterday? (By “actively” I mean that you weren’t multi-tasking at the time, so I don’t count plugging in your headphones and then zoning out.) When a representative sample of US adults answered that question recently,95% of them said zero. If you are currently part of that majority, here are five evidence-based recommendations to get you going.Find your creative pick-me-upView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Fotografía de eLuVe/Getty ImagesUse music and books to boost your mood. Swap your morning alarm for a song and take the time to listen to it before you get up. Swap doomscrolling on your commute for a novel. The dopamine release provided by stories and songs comes not only at the most joyous or exciting parts – the choruses in songs and climaxes in plotlines – but also from the tension that builds during the lead up to those moments, as our brains anticipate what’s coming. When a song or story feels too predictable, it can seem bland (think lift music) and there isn’t enough build-up of anticipation. If it’s too far outside our comfort zone, our brains don’t know how to judge it, so we miss the joy of the tension and resolution. So don’t feel pressure to pick a book or album you feel youshouldread or listen to. You can maximise the joy you get from the arts by finding your personal sweet spot between familiarity and complexity.Choose a new creative hobbyView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Posed by model; Thanasis Zovoilis/Getty ImagesIf you can dedicate between 30 and 60 minutes once a week to engaging in the arts, studies suggest you can expect to see improvements in your wellbeingwithin around six weeks. Think about which psychological needs aren’t being met in your life. If you’re feeling out of control, pick a hobby that lets you take the lead without needing instruction, such as drawing, creative writing or clay modelling. If you’re craving a feeling of mastery, try something that will allow you to develop a new skill. Crafts like crochet, or picking up a ukelele, can be a good option in winter, either with the support of YouTube demonstrations or a community class. Giving yourself a goal to work towards (a performance, or a gift to give to friends) can be a good motivator. Remember that failure is essential to building a sense of accomplishment, so if your pottery collapses or scarves unravel, practising dealing with such failures can build your sense of resilience.Get to an exhibitionWhether you’re a fan of Renaissance paintings, contemporary sculpture, immersive audiovisual installations or street art, exhibitions are a wonderful way to experience awe. But make sure you actually look! On average, we spendjust 28 secondslooking at art in exhibitions (and a fair chunk of that is often spent taking pictures). We need three or four seconds to form a basic emotional response and 10 seconds to decide cognitivelywhat we think about an artwork. But if we’re hoping the encounter will be more meaningful, we need time to look, think, respond, look again, and so on, and this takes minutes, not seconds. So don’t try to take in too much at once. It’s better to meaningfully engage with just a few exhibits on an arts expedition than try to take in everything.Use rhythm to enhance your exercise routineWhen we listen to music and dance, our movements, breathing and heartrates all synchronise to the beat. If the music is motivational in style (upbeat, peppy, joyful), we will run further, pedal faster, or do20% more bench presses in the same amount of time. Music can also inhibit physiological feedback signals of fatigue and pain and make us more efficient in our movements. Effectively, music is a legal performance-enhancing drug. A tempo of 125-140 bpm is a good rule of thumb when you’re working out, although you can push it higher if you’re trying to synchronise movements such as your running gait.Indulge in some make believeView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Posed by models; MoMo Productions/Getty ImagesAs adults, we have a tendency to dismiss play as frivolous and childish. How wrong we are. When we enter imaginary worlds, the temporary suspension of social norms and hierarchies allows us to understand the world from different angles, which helps our brains build mental flexibility to deal with unpredictable changes in our lives. So embrace your imagination, whether that’s by hosting a murder mystery acting evening, cosplaying, or finding a carnival or festival to put into your diary.I’ll be honest: most of the health fads I’ve been sucked into over the years haven’t brought me much joy. But last January I decided instead to practice what I preach. I can honestly say that the mental highlights of the year since have all revolved around the arts experiences I had. I wish you similar success with your creative endeavours in 2026.Art Cure: The Science of How the Arts Transform Our Health by Daisy Fancourt is published by Cornerstone Press.

Maybe you’re giving Dry January a go; maybe you fancy trying morezebra striping(alternating alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks) this year; or maybe you want to steer clear of alcohol for a while for health reasons. Whatever the motivation, many of us will use the new year as a chance to re-evaluate our relationship with booze and look for alternatives to the hard stuff.The Guardian’s journalism is independent.

The world of low-alcohol beer is particularly excellent, with loads of brilliantly brewed lagers, pilsners, stouts and ales that are just as exciting and tasty as their alcoholic counterparts.Spiritsare good, too, with delicious agave-based liquids and dozens of gin-adjacent spirits I’d be happy to drink in a 0% G&T. Wines can be more challenging, I find, but there are some that taste more than passable, and sparkling wines, teas and the like are often excellent.So, whether you’re in the market for an alcohol-free fizz, fancy trying some award-winning cider without the headache, or need a thoughtful gift for a teetotal friend, there’s plenty of great stuff out there if you know where to look.I’ve worked my way through 75 different booze-free beers, wines, spirits, kombuchas, premixed drinks and everything in between to find the best the category has to offer.Mid-strength drinks are having a moment. Here are 10 of the best lower-ABV beveragesRead moreTo make it into this list, I was looking for drinks under 2% ABV (the mid-strengthcategory hovering above this volume is also better than ever, but not so good for expectant mothers, drivers etc) that tasted genuinely delicious and worked as an alcohol alternative. While there are plenty of tasty shrubs, juices and sodas that can make Dry January a doddle, I didn’t consider them for this list.Here, then, is my pick of the best low- and no-alcohol drinks to raise a glass to, safe in the knowledge there’s no hangover in the post.The best non-alcoholic and low-alcohol drinks for 2026View image in fullscreenCheers to enjoying a tipple without paying for it the next day.Photograph: wilpunt/Getty ImagesBest low-alcohol red wineView image in fullscreenModerato merlot-tannat cuvee revolutionnaire, 0.5%£13 at Wise BartenderOf all the low-alcohol alternatives, a decent red wine is probably the hardest to find. Some taste like plasticky grape juice, while others try to replicate the complexity of an alcoholic red by introducing rogue flavours such as beetroot and herbs.No one will mistake this Moderato for a fully fledged merlot, but it does have the characteristic dark fruit notes of that grape, and its structure puts it firmly on the wine spectrum, rather than juice. Overall, it tastes extremely pleasant. Using grapes sourced from vineyards in south-west France, this wine is cold-distilled in the country’s first de-alcoholising centre, where they keep a careful eye on retaining the structure and aroma of the original wine. A decent food wine with rich casseroles and warming tagines, or enjoyed alone.Best alcohol-free ginView image in fullscreenCygnet Infinity, 0%£32 at CygnetWelsh gin brand Cygnet (co-founded by singer Katherine Jenkins) recently launched an alcohol-free expression. It’s created using the same 22 botanicals asCygnet 22 gin– though the brand insists it’s a stand-alone spirit rather than a gin imitation. It’s then further infused with all sorts of health buzzword ingredients, such as lion’s mane and Siberian ginseng, along with the manuka honey the gin is known for. The overall taste is honey-led with delicate florals and berries; deliciously light and botanical, and definitely nothing like a gin. It’s designed for sipping or mixing with soda, and I vastly prefer the latter of the two serves; drink with plenty of ice, a splash of soda and a berry garnish.Best sparkling teaView image in fullscreenFortnum & Mason sparkling tea, 0%£19.95 at Fortnum & MasonI’m a big fan of sparkling teas – they have a good level of complexity and tend not to be too sweet. This one from Fortnum’s is a favourite I return to often for giving as a gift and celebrations. It’s dry and tannic, thanks to the blend of rare black, white and green teas, while being fresh, fruity and fragrant with herbaceous notes. It tastes properly luxurious.Rose Pouchong sparkling teais a new addition to the range,brewed with a single black tea and rose petals; if you like things sweeter and deeper, then this won’t disappoint.Best dealcoholised sparkling wineView image in fullscreenBolle blanc de blancs, <0.5%£18.45 at Mind Your Wines£19.99 at Drink SupermarketSparkling wines are probably the safest bet in the low and no category. WhetherNozecoorVilarnau, I liked almost all of the low-alcohol fizzes I sampled, and many were truly excellent. This one edged ahead because of how expensive it tastes. It’s made in Spain using chardonnay grapes and is double fermented (as with champagne and cava) before being dealcoholised, and it’s a real treat however you look at it. It had a recognisable blanc de blancs profile – crisp orchard fruit and brioche notes – along with a properly persistent champagne-like mousse and a dryish finish. I’ll be buying this again.For morebooze-free bubbly, read our guide on thebestlow-alcohol prosecco, champagne and sparkling winesBest mocktailView image in fullscreenBelvoir Farm non-alcoholic lime and yuzu mojito, 0%£3.50 at Tesco£3.65 at WaitroseBelvoir Farm is better known for its nice cordials and soft drinks, but it now also has one of the biggest mocktail ranges in the UK. There’s passion fruit martini, peach bellini and more to choose from, but my pick is the Great Taste Award-winning lime and yuzu mojito, which is fresh, zesty and aromatic. Luscious-tasting and super-cooling, this mocktail is good on its own, but when muddled properly with fresh mint and lots of ice, no one would miss the real thing. I loved the unexpected edge that the yuzu brings.Best alcohol-free spiritView image in fullscreenThe Pathfinder hemp and root non-alcoholic spirit, <0.5%£29.75 at the Whisky Exchange£34.99 at AmazonSmoky, medicinal, herbal, bitter, citrusy, spicy: just some of the words I’d use to describe the taste of the Pathfinder, and I wouldn’t come close to defining its flavour. Darkly complex and intriguing, this new US-based alcohol-free spirit uses hemp, angelica root, juniper, saffron and other wild botanicals distilled into a liquid that works alone or in cocktails – as seen at the London cocktail bars Lyaness and Satan’s Whiskers. If you’re a fan of negroni, fernet or other amaro, then this is likely up your street. Try stirred with bitters, ice and a twist of orange for an alcohol-free twist on your favourites.Best alcohol-free tequila-style spirit (yes, really)View image in fullscreenAlmave Blancoblue agave spirit, 0%£21.57 at Master of Malt£21.39 at AmazonA zero-proof tequila-style spirit may not be the first thing you’d think to turn to when you’re not drinking, but this was an unexpected hit. Almave was founded by Lewis Hamilton in partnership with Mexican spirits group Casa Lumbre, and it has an immediately distinctive agave aroma, smelling and tasting extremely convincing. It’s genuinely nice even for sipping straight, but when made into a spicy margarita or mixed with grapefruit in a paloma, it’s fantastic.Best low-alcohol lagerView image in fullscreenBero Kingston golden pils, 0.5%£2.80 each at Wise Bartender£22.99 for six at AmazonBeer is one of the best places to explore the no- and low-alcohol lifestyle from: there are more good 0% beers than there are bad these days. Bero Kingston pils is a newcomer that’s well worth a look if you fancy something fresh. It’s a big, bold malty lager, with enough bitterness and richness of aroma for you not to mind the lack of alcohol. Founded by actor Tom Holland,who has been sober since Dry January 2022, when he couldn’t find something to fill his Dry January with, Bero has a range of styles, fromhazy IPAtowheats. This full-bodied and flavoursome pils variety was my testers’ favourite.Best low-alcohol aleView image in fullscreenFirebrand Brewing Co Shorebreak hazy pale ale, 0.5%£3 at Wise Bartender£3.89 at the Alcohol Free CoWhen summer finally arrives, you’ll be hard pressed to find a better drink to enjoy on the beach than this Cornish IPA. Ridiculously smooth, light and zingy with hoppy flavours, Firebrand Brewing’s Shorebreak bursts with hazily chilled tropical fruit flavours, such as pineapple, guava and banana. You might struggle to tell if it’s alcoholic or not – and when it tastes this great, with just 32 calories a can, who cares?I tried 40 tinned drinks: here are my favourite canned cocktails, wines and seltzers for sunny daysRead moreBest low-alcohol ciderView image in fullscreenChance Clean cider, 0.5% (12 x 330ml)£34.85 at the Alcohol Free Co£24.95 at AmazonThe alcohol-free cider category has gone from strength to strength. I’m impressed with new brand Chance, which joins the lineup of great-tasting low-alcohol ciders that don’t just taste like apple juice. This is the UK’s first dedicated alcohol-free cider and has won a slew of awards for its crisp, citrussy taste. It’s bursting with British apple flavours and has a woody, grownup aftertaste that sets it apart from many others. Made by removing the alcohol from a punchy 8.2% cider, Chance manages to taste light yet retain the mouthfeel of a real alcoholic cider. It’s low in sugar, too.For more:The best no- and low-alcohol winesThe best mid-strength drinksJoanne Gould is afood, drink and lifestyle writer with a decade of experience.

Their thankless existence involves repeatedly cleaning one of the grimmest parts of the body, then being thrown out once their bristles are insufficiently effective. Or, in the case ofelectric toothbrushes, decapitated before resuming their duties with a fresh head.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.This relentless cycle is essential for hygiene reasons: an ineffective brush can lead directly to tooth decay and gum disease. However, given the big dual crises of our time – climate and cost of living – it would certainly help for toothbrushes to last a bit longer. So what can we do to maximise their longevity without sacrificing dental hygiene?How to make your toothbrush last longerDon’t overcharge the batteryView image in fullscreenPowering on: get the most out of a toothbrush battery by only recharging when it’s required.Photograph: sanatgen/Getty ImagesEvery electric toothbrush has a battery inside the handle that, just as with a phone, will degrade over time. In most cases, this battery isn’t easily replaceable, so treating it well is essential.“In general, it’s best not to charge your battery frequently, whether it’s ours or any other [toothbrush brand’s] batteries,” says Gyve Safavi, co-founder of the electric toothbrush maker Suri, which has made sustainability a key selling point.Frequent charging erodes battery capacity, he says. “If you want it to last as long as possible, charge it overnight and leave it. Don’t charge it again until it goes out.”Read ourSuri 2.0 electric toothbrush reviewKeep it cleanYou may think that keeping your brush clean is a hygiene-only issue, but it’s also helpful for bristle longevity.“I have seen patients ruin heads more from storage habits than from brushing,” says Dr Alan McCaffrey, founder of Red Rock Dental in Las Vegas. “Both electric and manual brushes can last longer than most people think if they are cared for correctly, but they should never be used past the point where bristles are frayed or ineffective.“One way to extend the life of the head is to rinse it thoroughly in hot water after every use and then let it air dry upright,” he says. “Moisture trapped at the base [of the bristle] is what causes buildup and weakens bristles faster.”Dr Nicole Khalife, owner of Lux Smiles in New York, agrees. “Clean bristles dry faster than those that stay sticky. Dry bristles are less friendly to germs, and the brush lasts longer.”Some toothbrushes come with travel caps: small covers that can be placed over the head of the brush to protect it from dirt and detritus in luggage. But you should only use them when on the road, Khalife says. “They protect the head from dirt in a suitcase, but at home, they trap moisture. Use a ventilated pouch instead of a solid cap and always let the brush dry before packing it.”If your brush doesn’t fully dry between uses, you could switch between brushes or heads each day, McCaffrey suggests. “Giving the bristles a day to fully dry helps them keep their shape and stiffness for longer.”Look after the bodyIt’s not just the heads that need cleaning. There’s usually a visible gap between them and the body, and excess toothpaste can calcify around here, which could interfere with how the brush functions. Use a damp cloth to gently remove this, and then dry it thoroughly when done.Allowing the brush to air dry is important, especially when it comes to charging. I’m pretty sure I got through a couple of Suri 1.0 chargers after repeated contact with a damp brush caused rust on the conductive metal connectors.Watch your techniqueView image in fullscreenGently does it is the advice from dental experts on the pressure needed when brushing.Photograph: AlexBr1972/Getty ImagesStorage is only one part of the toothbrush longevity puzzle. “Many people press hard because they think it makes their teeth cleaner,” says Khalife. “In fact, intense pressure bends the bristles and scratches the enamel. A gentle circular motion works better because the tips of the bristles sweep away plaque without flattening the fibres. Bristles that keep their shape will reach between teeth and along the gumline for the whole life of the brush.”Electric toothbrushes have an advantage here, with users encouraged to let the motor’s vibrations do the work, rather than brushing as with manual ones.“Electric toothbrushes are designed to help prevent over-brushing, which can cause damage to your enamel and gums,” says Barty Walsh, CEO and founder of electric toothbrush maker Ordo. “If you’re going through brush heads faster than two to three months, this is a sign you may need to change your brushing technique.”It’s worth looking for an electric model with a pressure sensor, which will warn you when you’re pushing too hard.Resist the latest modelFrom a sustainability and consumption perspective, you’d ideally not buy a new model – no matter how shiny and wonderful the adverts make it look.“The best thing we can all do is use what we have for as long as we can,” says Suri’s Safavi.… but know when (and how) to say ‘goodbye’View image in fullscreen‘Bamboo toothbrushes are the easiest to recycle.’Photograph: Yulia Lisitsa/AlamyEventually, all toothbrushes will die, and continuing to brush with them beyond their useful lifespan is bad for your teeth. If your manual brush’s bristles are splayed beyond recognition, or your electric brush’s battery will no longer hold a charge, then it’s time to dispose of it responsibly and move on.Bamboo brushes are the easiest to recycle: remove the nylon bristles, and then compost the bamboo handle or find an alternative use for it (see below).For plastic manual brushes, it’s worth seeing if the manufacturer has a recycling programme. If not, you can see ifTerracyclehas a collection point near you.If there’s no local option bar landfill, you can always find alternative uses for brushes. Even splayed bristles can be effective at cleaning between bathroom tiles. While I wasable to donate the electric toothbrush bodies from my group test, the heads were rightly considered unhygienic, so they have enjoyed a second life cleaning my cats’ grubby chins.Some brands recycle brush heads free of charge, including Suri and Ordo, whileLiveCoco,BrushdandEdincosell recyclable heads for Oral-B and Philips Sonicare devices. But if companies won’t, “find an e-waste bin, if your council has one”, says Safavi, “and if not, there’sRecycleNow online”.Electric or manual toothbrushes – which last longer?View image in fullscreenNo contest … electric and manual bristles degrade at the same rate.Photograph: Firn/Getty ImagesWhether you’re using an electric toothbrush or a manual one, bristles degrade at the same rate, with experts agreeing on a lifespan of three months for brushes used twice a day.Of course, for electric toothbrushes, the heads can be replaced, giving them an advantage in the longevity stakes. That said, they’re not a clean win for sustainability as they rely on lithium-ion batteries. There are myriad environmental issues here, from thehuge water use, land degradation andchemical leakageassociated with the mining of Earth minerals, tohazards connected to the batteries’ disposal.There are several more sustainable manual options – particularly those with a bamboo body – which promise a more environmentally friendly middle ground. However, as I covered in my guide to thebest electric toothbrushes, experts agree that manual brushes aren’t generally as effective at teeth cleaning.As Caitlin Miller, head of hygiene and therapy at Bupa Dental Care UK, put it to me at the time: “To get the same level of cleaning found with an electric toothbrush, you’d have to spend a lot longer than two minutes brushing with a manual.”For more ideas to help your favourite items last longer:From beeswax to baby wipes: how to make your leather last a lifetime‘Glass chopping boards should be illegal’: how to look after your kitchen knivesFrom cloths to cleaning tablets: how to make your coffee machine last longerExplore more on these topicsHealth & wellbeingThe FilterGadgetsHygienefeaturesShareReuse this content"

I had a couple of carrots and a piece of squash that needed saving, so I turned them into a golden kraut with ginger, turmeric and a little orange zest for brightness. Use whatever you have to hand and let the ingredients lead your creativity.Fridge raid sauerkrautFermenting is an enjoyable way to make the most of a seasonal ingredient or to use up surplus produce. At our restaurant, whenever we had a glut that needed using up, we used to rely on fermentation, because not only did it saves us money in the long term, it also helped us to create imaginative, delicious new products to cook with.Classic cabbage kraut is, of course, glorious, but there are all manner of alternatives, and some magic combinations. Just get creative, use what you have and eat the rainbow. As with classic sauerkraut, the general rule of thumb is that you need about 3% salt to the total weight of vegetables.Now, just a few notes on fermentation in general. Keep the jar out of direct sunlight and check on it every day. Give it some love, and a stir, perhaps, and make sure the ingredients are always submerged in the liquid (a fermentation weight will help here, as would any other clean weight). Only use organic unwaxed citrus zest, because conventional citrus tends to be subjected to very high levels of fungicides and pesticides.Finally, if you’re new to fermenting, maybe consider making two jars: keep one in the fridge and leave the other to ferment on the counter, then taste both over time to teach your tastebuds how the flavour of each develops as it matures. You will need a large sterilised jar with a lid.Makes1 x 500g jar400g mixed hard vegetables(carrot, squash, beetroot, kohlrabi, turnip, radish, celeriac, broccoli stems – any combination you like), all washed and grated or finely sliced12g sea saltOptional extrasFinely grated zest of 1 unwaxed organic lemon or ½ orange, to taste1-3 tsp grated fresh ginger, to taste1 small piecefresh turmeric, or 1 tsp ground turmeric (this will dye the food yellow)1-2 tsp caraway, cumin or coriander seeds, whole or ground, to tasteTip the grated vegetables into a large bowl, scatter over the salt, then add any of the optional extras that you fancy. Mix everything with your hands, and massage firmly for a few minutes, until the vegetables start to soften and release their juices.Spoon the mixture into a large sterilised jar, press it down tightly, then pour in any brine from the bottom of the bowl and firmly push the vegetables beneath the liquid; if they aren’t fully submerged, top up with a splash of filtered water mixed with a tiny pinch of salt.Place the lid loosely on top of the jar – this will allow the gases to escape – then leave at room temperature for at least four days, checking regularly until it’s bubbling and the brine tastes lightly acidic. If you prefer a deeper, more complex flavour, keep it fermenting it on the counter for longer. Otherwise, for a milder kraut, seal and put in the fridge, where it will keep for four to six months.Explore more on these topicsFoodWaste notFood wastePickling, fermenting and preservingVegetablesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The lentils cook down into a smooth, golden blend, their gentle sweetness enriched by sauteed onions, garlic and a touch of spice. A drizzle of dukkah oil brightens things up, making it perfect for January. Then, a Levantine chickpea stew with aubergine and tahini, which is so nourishing and full of flavour. Tender chickpeas simmer slowly in a rich tomato base until they absorb the sweetness of onions, garlic, and the gentle warmth of cumin. Fried aubergine melts into the stew, and its smoky softness gives each spoonful a lush texture.Red lentil soup with dukkah oil (pictured top)As the dukkah oil mingles with the soup, it releases an earthy aroma: nutty, citrussy and softly spiced. Served with a slice of crusty bread and a squeeze of lemon, this soup is a quiet celebration of comfort, spice and the beauty of humble ingredients.Prep15 minCook1 hr 5 minServes4-6125ml extra-virgin olive oil125g finely chopped white onion125g grated carrot25g crushed garlic25g tomato paste4g smoked paprika1 tsp table salt1 pinchcracked black pepper4g ground cumin4g ground coriander250g dried red lentilsFor the dukkah oil30g coriander seeds80g cumin seeds30g urfa chilliFinely grated zest of 1 lemon120ml rapeseed oilFirst, make the dukkah oil.

How do they date?In Vallejo, California, ‘trad sons’ report feeling trapped by family obligations, slim job prospects and the fear of violence – leaving little room for romanceArielle DombWed 7 Jan 2026 08.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 7 Jan 2026 15.25 ESTShareAre boys becoming men later? In recent decades, the markers of adulthood have shifted for young American men: they are almost twice as likely to besingle, less likely togo to collegeand more likely to beunemployed. Most significantly for their parents, they are also less likely to have fled the nest, with the term “trad son” springing into social media lexicon in recent months. In the 1970s, only 8% of Americans aged 25 to 34 were living with their parents, but by 2023, that figure had jumped to 18%, with men more likely to live at home than women, according to aPew survey.But not everywhere in the US has the same rates of adults living in their familial home. The living arrangement is least common in the midwest and most common in the north-east. Topping the list was Vallejo, where 33% of young adults live with their parents. How were they making it work?In Vallejo, Jorge, a 30-year-old personal trainer at City Sports Club, told me he was in no rush to move out. Neither was Kimani Cochran, a 31-year-old model, actor and bar attendant, who had settled into the rhythms of an intergenerational home. Edward, a 28-year-old government employee, had reached his limit with cohabitation, while Daniel, a 25-year-old union worker who dreams of becoming an electrician, felt ambivalent about the prospect of leaving his family behind. (Some of the men spoke to me on the condition that I refer to them by their middle name only.)View image in fullscreenA street in Vallejo, California, a waterfront city about an hour from San Francisco.Photograph: Arielle Domb/The Guardian‘My definition of my home is my family’About an hour from San Francisco, Vallejo is a waterfront city, where hills of pastel-painted, wood-pannelled houses overlook an industrial shoreline. Home to thefirstnaval station on the west coast, large numbers of Black, Filipino and Hispanic workers flocked to the city throughout the 20th century, making Vallejo at one pointthe most diversemetropolitan area in the country. Today, food stalls selling fluorescent cups ofaguafrescaspepper the roadsides, while the waterfront has become a local hangout, speckled with quiet breweries and bars. There are fewer young peoplethanthe average California city, according tocensus data: Vallejo has a median age of 40, California’s is around 38.Today Vallejo’s population isevenly splitbetween Latino/Hispanic, Asian, white and Black communities, a diversity which is sometimes cited as part of the reason behind the high occurrence of intergenerational households.Across the country, Asian, Hispanic and Black young adults are more likely to live in a parent’s home than their white peers. “It’s mainly traditions,” Jorge, who is Mexican and lives in Vallejo with his sister and parents, told me. “My definition of my home is my family and so I want to keep them with me as much as I can.”View image in fullscreenJorge, a 30-year-old personal trainer who lives in Vallejo with his sister and parents.Photograph: Arielle Domb/The GuardianAfter college, Jorge had a stint of living apart from his family, who would tell him stories about shootouts or drive-bys in their neighbourhood. It didn’t feel right, being miles away from them. Worried about their safety, he moved back home. Since Donald Trump’s re-election, that feeling of wanting to protect his parents has only amplified. “Everything that’s going on in the political atmosphere, it creates some sort of fear on my end,” he says, “knowing that my dad is out there and tormented at anytime by ICE.”Jorge is single. You might expect that living with his parents in his 30s affects his romantic life, but he says that coming home to them each night is a “blessing”. “It motivates me to have that genuine understanding with my partner,” he says. He plans to stay put until he wants to have his own children, at which point he hopes his parents will come to live with him.“I don’t care if I don’t have my own things. I don’t care if I don’t have the bachelor pad,” he says, “I want my family to be safe.”Across much of the world, living in the familial home is not perceived as at odds with adulthood. Intergenerational households are the norm in countries from Italy to India to China. “It’s part of the culture,” says Edward, who lives in Vallejo with his sister and parents who immigrated from the Philippines. Edward cites the Filipino wordhiya, denoting self-sacrifice and caring for one’s elders. “The family is more important than the individual,” he says.But respecting cultural traditions is not always easy. “Recently [my parents have] been pushing all these people from the Philippines, these girls, trying to set me up with them, and it’s just annoying.” About two years ago, Edward said his mom went on his Facebook and messaged a girl from high school he had mentioned in passing. “I felt violated,” he recalls. “I said: ‘OK, that’s it. That crosses the line.’” Now Edward says he wants to move on. “I have to get out of here,” he says. “I’m not gonna be happy if I keep on living their choices and I can’t live for myself.”View image in fullscreenThe waterfront in Vallejo.Photograph: Arielle Domb/The Guardian‘I don’t even have time for myself’In the 1990s, Jeffrey Jensen Arnett, then a psychology professor at the University of Missouri, began conducting interviews with Americans in their late teens and early 20s. He noticed a trend: young adults in the US were delaying the traditional milestones of adulthood such as getting married, having children and moving out their parents’ home. In 2001, Arnett published Emerging Adulthood: The Winding Road from the Late Teens Through the Twenties,putting forward the case that 18- to 25-year-olds belonged to “a new and historically unprecedented period of the life course”.Fewer one night stands, more AI lovers: the data behind generation Z’s sex livesRead moreEmerging adults, he wrote, are in a life period categorised by identity exploration and feelings of in-betweenness. Twenty-five years since the book’s publication, Arnett says that the phase of emerging adulthood has become even longer. “The whole decade of the 20s now is quite unstable in terms of employment,” Arnett, who is now a professor at Clark University, tells me. Emerging adults today are spending even longer in education and having children even later. “I thought things would probably plateau by about age 30,” he says, “but it’s still going up.”Job security is a key factor in the dating lives of young men in Vallejo – of the 10 men I spoke with aged 19 to 31 living in their familial homes in Vallejo, nine were single, and several emphasised that they were focused on work as opposed to dating. “Back in the day, maybe [women] were settling for less. I feel like times have changed,” says Christopher, a Vallejo resident who lives with his parents and two brothers. He said he was currently prioritizing his welding apprenticeship over meeting a partner. “They want a guy with a job. They want a guy with a car. A provider.”View image in fullscreenEdward, a 28-year-old government agency worker who lives in Vallejo with his sister and parents.Photograph: Arielle Domb/The GuardianMultiple young men said that being seen on a dating app in Vallejo was embarrassing, while others described romance as a distraction from achieving their goals. The picture echoed national dating trends indicating that young adults are engaging inless “risky behaviours”, such as casual sex. One survey, conducted byDatingAdvice.comand the Kinsey Institute, found that more thanone in three (37%) gen Z adultsreported to be celibate in 2025, withinflationcited as the main reason why.Kent Fortner, the owner of two Mare Island Brewing locations in Vallejo, says that, in his estimation, only a quarter of his clientele are in their early 20s, compared with about 35% a decade ago. He reckons this is because going to college is so expensive, which makes young adults more focused on work. “If you’re going to spend a quarter of a million dollars,” he says, “you don’t want to be screwing around while you’re doing that.”“If it was financially possible,” Edward told me, “I would have more time for social circles.” Edward makes less than $3,000 each month – a salary that feels incompatible with rising Bay Area rents. And spending about three hours each day commuting from Vallejo to his office in San Francisco and back, he feels wiped out. “With all that time spent commuting and working, I don’t have time for personal relationships,” he says. “I don’t even have time for myself sometimes.”‘Nobody wants to be a man’There are other reasons why young adults in Vallejo may be experiencing adulthood at a different pace. Crime in Vallejo is above the national average, and the fear of violence trickles into some men’s intimate lives. “It’s hard to find a healthy relationship, especially in this type of lifestyle,” says Daniel, who lives with his parents in a suburban house decorated with Christian iconography and framed family photographs, with a back yard filled with animals: three white, fluffy roosters, two big, boisterous dogs, two hens and two pigs.View image in fullscreenDaniel works in his parent’s back yard with one of the family dogs.Photograph: Arielle Domb/The Guardian“Basically everyone I know lives with their mom, or if they moved out, they moved back in,” he says. “Back then, the American dream was like: you start a family, you get a job … you get your own house.” Today things are different. “I don’t know one couple that has bought a house and started a family out here,” he says, “Everyone wants to be tough Tony … A lot of people think that they’re not going to be nobody until they get violent. Nobody wants to be a man.”Researchhas linked young men living at home in their early 20s with an increased risk of violence. Rayvon Williamson, a program manager at IHART, a Vallejo-based mobile crisis response unit, says that his team is called in to mediate a parent-child conflict at least once a week, and disputes involving young adults are frequent. He said a common pattern is young adults moving out the family home but not having enough skills or experience to get a job and support themselves financially, so they move back in, feeling defeated, embarrassed and ashamed. “That’s always a tough dynamic: how do I stand in my adulthood when I’m still so dependent on my parents?” Williamson says. “You just revert to what you understand manhood to be.”Daniel says that most of his friends are in long-term relationships because in his social circles meeting new people comes with risk. Once, he says, a girl wanted to meet up with one of his friends, and was “acting like she liked him”, but ended up robbing him when they met up. “If my friends meet up with a girl. They’re going to send me their location,” he says. “If you don’t know their family, if you don’t know where they live, you do not trust them.”View image in fullscreenDaniel and his friends hang out in his parent’s garage.Photograph: Arielle Domb/The GuardianView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Arielle Domb/The GuardianStreet violence has shaped Daniel’s trajectory, too. Two and a half years ago, on his first day at a new job as an electrician, he found out a close relative and a friend had been shot and killed in a double homicide. Heartbroken, he didn’t return to work. Daniel had been gunning to move in with his girlfriend by the time he was 25, but amid all the pain, they broke up. The couple eventually got back together, but he’s still living with his parents. “I feel like it’s affecting my growth,” he says, “like you can only grow as much as your surroundings.”19 dead in a decade: the small American city where violent police thriveRead moreBefore the double homicide, Daniel and his friends would ride around Vallejo on dirt bikes and go to “side shows” – street events where drivers do stunts like doughnuts and burnouts. These days their lives have slowed down. Vallejo once had one of the most violent police forces in the US, and while police-involved killings havedeclinedin recent years, locals say harassment is common, particularly for people of colour. A few months ago, Daniel had his licence taken away for an incident in which he said police “had confused me with someone else”.“It makes me feel like I’ve got to work harder,” says Daniel,who is Hispanic. “I feel like I have to dress more appropriate of my age, like if I just wear a hoodie or some shit, someone’s gonna think I’m doing something bad.” Without a licence, Daniel says he is not eligible for the jobs he wants to do, and without a job, he doesn’t have the money to move out. “I can’t do anything,” he said. “They’re gonna win either way.”Daniel dreams of becoming an electrician again. “I know, as a man, that I need to jump out the nest soon,” he says. “Sometimes I do want to come home and it just be me and it just be mine.” But striving for stability sometimes feels like a sisyphean pursuit. “I want to get an apartment out here, but it’s like, there’s no point. I feel like I’ll just get in trouble or some shit.”‘This is actually peace’According to Arnett, one of the main reasons why American men are completing adult milestones later than women is a shift from a manufacturing economy to a knowledge economy, which has left many men displaced from the workforce. “It’s happened so fast that we really haven’t made the adjustments yet,” he says. “We need to do better at educating young men,” so we’re not “paying for it later” in unemployment benefits, incarceration, substance abuse treatment and domestic violence, he says. “We should think of them as investments.”But at the same time, Arnett emphasises that delaying certain milestones of maturity is not always a bad thing. “Young people of the past were constricted in a variety of ways, from gender roles to economics, which prevented them from using their late teens and twenties for exploration,” he writes in Emerging Adulthood.Social and economic shifts have provided today’s emerging adults with “an exceptional opportunity to try out different ways of living and different options for love and work”.With so little research into patterns of youth habitation, there is still a lot to learn about how living at home intersects with young adults’ sexuality, religion, dreams and desires. But it’s a place, like many US cities, where adulthood was something that was being constantly negotiated through the daily patterns of cohabiting. Daniel’s, for example, has become a hub for his friends to hang out in – and his friends have a warm, banterous relationship with his mom. “I just feel like I have so many sons now,” she told me. She doesn’t mind what the boys get up to, as long as they’re home. “It doesn’t matter. They’re safe.”View image in fullscreenDaniel and his friends hang out on the street.Photograph: Arielle Domb/The GuardianKimani Cochran returned to his chosen parents’ home two years ago (the couple took him under their wing when he was 16), after he had struggled to find acting work in Los Angeles during the writers’ strike. He does not think being there stifles his growth. These days he works at a bar in Vallejo, and regularly has groups of friends over for barbecues or games of Uno in his back yard. Cochran is gay, and while he is not dating at the moment, he does not think that living with his parents impacts his romantic life. “My parents are literally the most open-minded humans you will ever meet,” he says. “They’re like, ‘Whatever you do is your business.’”Cochran’s biological dad was in and out of prison throughout his childhood and his mom was often unable to pay rent. It meant he was constantly moving house, so he would keep his possessions in a single box, ready to move on short notice. “Now I’m in a space where I don’t pressure myself to flight,” he says.Being an adult might look different from what he expected, but Cochran appreciates the freedom living with his foster parents has given him to slow down. “It took me a minute to realise that this is what a normal family feels like,” he says, “seeing what Black love could be and what love is.” For the first time in his life, Cochran has made his room his own, filling the space with vinyls, paintings, photos of his biological dad and his grandparents. “This is actually peace. This is home,” he says.Additional reporting by Sebastien KBridonneauExplore more on these topicsCaliforniaThe sex lives of gen ZWest CoastSexRelationshipsFamilyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

And not only that it can take you anywhere, although it can. It is not even that it never goes out of style, or that good quality versions are accessible at real-world prices, although those are true also.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.A white shirt is self-confidence. It stands for it, and it brings it, and that’s the real secret. It is a superhero cloak that bestows you with this formidable power. Self-confidence is not as snazzy as the ability to fly or live for ever, but arguably it’s more practical. I don’t know why or how it works, but it doesn’t matter, because if you feel confident then you are confident. Faking it and making it are one and the same here.Courage is everything at this time of year, when life can feel a bit daunting. Perhaps your instinct is to hibernate in a hoodie. Hey, I hear you. But while a hoodie can cushion you from the cold dark world, a white shirt can help you tackle said world. And it is almost as easy to wear. Plus you almost certainly have one in your wardrobe, so you know it makes sense.When you free the white shirt from its corporate shackles, it lifts you up with itA white shirt is an easy option with a formal suit or tucked neatly into tailored trousers or a pencil skirt. But it really comes into its own when you allow it to cut loose. Embrace its breeziness, and it makes you feel breezy too. Wear it crisp and loose, and let it put the wind in your sails.When you free the white shirt from its corporate shackles, it lifts you up with it. It will make casual bottoms look instantly more fashion-forward than a T-shirt or knit. It has style pedigree, but not so much personality that it overwhelms yours. It doesn’t compete with you, it supports you instead. It looks calmly intentional, but somehow also as if you just pulled it on without a second thought.It does take a little practice to get the styling right. And the white shirt look is not a one-size-fits-all. I often see women wearing oversized white shirts, buttoned to the neck and cuff, magnificent as a galleon in full sail. Often, the kind of women who can pull off a slicked back bun and extra long trousers that puddle over shoes. But none of these – the buttoned-up big white box shirt, the slick bun, the puddled hems – work on me. A look that aims for “Mayfair art curator” somehow lands closer to “repainting the hallway”.I have worked out that the most effective way to harness its swagger while still feeling like myself is to soften the edges. Leave the top and bottom buttons undone, so that the neckline falls open, and the shirt tails drape and swing. Roll the sleeves up to the elbow. The effect is subtle, but it changes everything. You still get the grand architectural sweep of shirting, but the posture feels more relaxed. If you were driving a car, you would have loosened your grip on the steering wheel just enough to sing along to the radio. It becomes less of an authority figure, and more of a ​partner in crime.Speaking of partners in crime, there is no better pairing for a white shirt than jeans. Now that jeans have got wider, resist the impulse to automatically tuck the shirt in. The wider profile of jeans means there is more denim on display, so if you tuck in the top half, the balance is off. Let the shirt swing free. No cheating with a French half-tuck. It will feel strange at first, but stand back and have a look in the mirror, and you will see what I mean: the proportions are just better. The outfit has a natural harmony. The jeans bring ease, the shirt adds purpose. No matter that, moments earlier, you were standing in front of your wardrobe muttering “help” under your breath. To the outside world, this is a look that declares you have mastered the art of effortless style. And when you start the day like that, the sky’s the limit.Model: Imogen May at Milk.

Here’s our pick of boltholes for a new year reset – each with a spa and rooms for under £160 a nightJoanne O'Connor, Jane Knight and Lucy GillmoreWed 7 Jan 2026 02.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 7 Jan 2026 02.02 ESTShareThe Alfriston, East SussexVirginia Woolf described the South Downs as “too much for one pair of eyes, enough to float a whole population in happiness”. So where better to head at this time of year, when our happiness levels are traditionally at their lowest ebb? Striding across the rolling chalkland towards the teetering sea cliffs buoyed up by a stiff breeze is the perfect antidote to the January blues. And if there’s a cosy hotel bar with an open fire waiting for you at the end of the walk, so much the better.The Alfriston, on the edge of the Sussex village of the same name, reopened under new owners last spring. Housed in a red-brick manor house, parts of which date back to the 14th century, its new look nods to the Arts and Crafts movement with attractive block-printed wallpapers, patterned furnishings and wood panelling painted in warm colours.There’s a long front lawn laid out for games of croquet, skittles and pétanque but the jewel in the crown is the 10-metre outdoor pool, heated and open year-round. After a swim, warm up in the sauna or steam room or treat yourself to a massage or beauty treatment in the small spa area. On a Saturday evening the 1554 Brasserie was lively with a mix of guests and locals and the menu had something to please all palates – from slow-roasted Norfolk cauliflower (£18 for a main) to haunch of fallow deer with chestnuts and cacao sauce (£28). My starter of scallops followed by grilled whole sea bass with samphire was excellent. After a deep sleep we woke up to views across the mist-shrouded downs and breakfast in the Orangery, where the walls are hand-painted with delicate murals of trees and flowers. I can’t help feeling that Woolf, whose Charleston farmhouse HQ was just a few miles away, would approve.Doubles from £135 B&B,thealfriston.comJoanne O’ConnorWildhive Callow Hall, near Ashbourne, DerbyshireView image in fullscreenThe feel was more cool Cotswolds than traditional Derbyshire as my son and I pulled up at this hotel, just outside Ashbourne, with its glass-box restaurant jutting out from a grand Victorian mansion. The hotel’s interiors, with grand staircase and ornate ceilings, have been injected with eye-catching colours and a swirl of patterns by designer Isabella Worsley. The best-value rooms are here in the main building, with cute treehouse-style wooden hives tucked into the 35 acres of grounds should you feel more flush.Just down the hill is the Coach House, home to a small spa offering botanical facials, reflexology and massage, a yoga studio, gym and sauna. This is where you’ll also find the map room, stocking everything you need to plan a day out, and complimentary bikes. We headed out on the blessedly flat 13-mile Tissington Trail, which runs along the old Ashbourne to Buxton railway line. It was an easy ride but we still felt entirely justified in demolishing an enormous shared platter of seafood misto in the buzzy restaurant, with its curved bar and artificial olive trees.Doubles from £157 room-only,wildhive.ukJane KnightThe Cliff Hotel & Spa, Cardigan BayView image in fullscreenThe Cliff Hotel overlooks the grand sweep of Cardigan Bay.Photograph: Gavin Haskell/AlamyBlow away any lingering Christmas cobwebs at this breezy coastal retreat on a headland above the grand sweep of Cardigan Bay. From the lobby to the restaurant and 76 guest rooms, the style throughout is slick and contemporary, with soothing shades of grey, green and blue reflecting the Atlantic views framed by the huge picture windows.There’s plenty to do here: go for a walk along the Ceredigion coast path (keep your eyes peeled for bottlenose dolphins and seals); have a round of golf at the hotel’s own nine-hole course; watch the surfers battling the swells at nearby Poppit Sands; or head into Cardigan for a mooch around the castle and shops.Soak away winter chills in the hotel’s underground spa, which has a hydrotherapy pool, steam room, sauna, hot tub and gym, and offers a range of good-value treatments from facials to algae wraps and hot stone massage (from around £70 for a 50-minute treatment). An hour’s use of the spa facilities is included in the room rate for hotel guests.Doubles from £110 B&B,cliffhotel.comJO’CThe Barnsdale, near Oakham, RutlandView image in fullscreenRutland Water sits practically on the doorstep of this hotel in England’s smallest historic county. The quiet appeal of the location is mirrored indoors. A woodburner in reception makes you feel instantly at home, while beyond lies a relaxed sequence of spaces: a comfy seating area, the restaurant and bar with wooden floors, banquettes and modern art, and the Orangery dining room.The 45 bedrooms, arranged in two storeys around an appealing courtyard, come with boldly coloured fabric headboards and patterned paper (pick one on the first floor for a quieter night). After checking mine out, I set off to circumnavigate the 23-mile reservoir by bike, earning the excellent bistro meal that awaited my return, including the hotel’s signature tempura cauliflower popcorn.The Barnsdale offers superb value, but there’s still a pleasing spirit of generosity. If dry January isn’t your thing, there’s a complimentary 4pm drink in the bar as well as a nightcap. Massages are sensibly priced (£90 for 60 minutes) and you have unfettered access to the sauna, hot tub and outdoor pool from midday on arrival until the same time on departure, without paying extra. It’s civilised and faintly indulgent, all for just north of £100 a night.Doubles from £125 B&B (£105 on Sundays),barnsdalerutland.comJane KnightDunkeld House Hotel, PerthshireView image in fullscreenThe approach to this elegant, white country house hotel couldn’t be dreamier, a speed-bump-controlled crawl through sweeping, tree-studded parkland, a bronze stag guarding the doorway. Bedded above the fast-flowing River Tay, on the edge of the historic village of Dunkeld (a mile-long meander along the riverside path) it was built at the end of the 19th century as a summer retreat for the 7th Duke of Atholl.Today, it’s a relaxed and welcoming hotel (help yourself to a dram of whisky or glass of sherry) with a roaring log fire in the wood-panelled reception, muted tartan carpets and a smattering of taxidermy, including a mighty stag’s head lording it over the grand staircase.Book a room with a tree-fringed river view: for a treat, the Duchess suite has a balcony, parquet flooring, art deco styling and gold-trimmed bathroom. The spa has a pool and indoor hot tub looking over plant-peppered gardens and offers ishga Hebridean seaweed treatments, hot stone massages, detoxifying seaweed wraps and restorative facials. The food is also fabulous, highlighting the Highlands’ larder with the likes of creamy smoked haddock cullen skink and venison loin with roasted roots.Doubles from £144 B&B,crerarhotels.comLucy GillmoreWood Hall Hotel & Spa, Wetherby, West YorkshireView image in fullscreenIf you’re looking for a cosseting country house escape that feels a bit special but refreshingly unstuffy, this ivy-clad Georgian manor house near Wetherby could be the answer. The location is suitably bucolic – set within 100 acres of rolling parkland and forest – but it’s just a short drive from Leeds, Harrogate and York.Inside, the public areas are elegant but not old-fashioned, and the 44 bedrooms, kitted out in soothing shades of grey, are comfortable, many with far-reaching views across the Wharfe valley from the sash windows. Go for a walk in the grounds – there are printed maps for guests – or indulge in a treatment in the small Elemis spa (treatments from £60 for 25 minutes), which also has a pool, steam room and gym.In the smart dining room, the seasonally-adjusted menu runs the gamut from homemade gnocchi with butternut squash and black garlic (£18.50) to pan-fried wood pigeon breast with game and pearl barley ragout (£28.50). There’s also an excellent kids menu.Doubles from £130 B&B,handpickedhotels.co.ukJO’CAll lead-in prices are based on a one-night stay in January or February and were correct at time of publication.Explore more on these topicsHotelsUnited Kingdom holidaysLuxury travelSpa breaksfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Its cover was torn and smudged, its pages curled and singed, but it was still legible. Still speaking.Two days earlier, on 13 June 2025, missiles from Israel began striking Tehran. There were no sirens, just sudden, violent blasts. The internet was completely cut off. I was in my apartment, translating Jhumpa Lahiri’sTranslating Myself and Others– a book about what it means to transport words across languages, and the ethics and anxieties of inhabiting another’s voice. As buildings fell, I sat editing a text that argued, in its quiet way, for the endurance of meaning.Everything halted. A book my publisher had been about to send to press was stranded when the printing house shut down. Bookstores closed one by one. One night, when the blasts were too close, my family and I ran down the stairs toward the basement beneath the parking garage. I couldn’t stop thinking about the bookshelves in my apartment, filled with dictionaries, rare volumes I had spent years collecting and every book I had ever translated. That library was my lifework, and I didn’t know if I, or it, would survive the night.My partner left with her parents for what they thought would be safer towns – places that, days later, were also hit. My daughter travelled to stay in another city with her mother. As her train was pulling out, she sent me a photo: in the distance, a factory was burning, black smoke coiling into the sky. People closest to me were suddenly elsewhere, and danger seemed to follow them.During those days, moods moved through the city like weather: sudden fear, anxiety, moral outrage at the injustice, then numbness. Beyond the emotional toll, the bombardment dismantled my ability to work. Without electricity and the internet, I had no access to the instant searches and references that translation demands.Outside, blast waves tore windows from their frames; at my cousin’s house, every pane was shattered, the furniture lay damaged, broken household items scattered throughout the rooms. When I visited, a woman sat before the ruins, painting at an easel, refusing to let silence and dust have the last word.A photograph circulated on social media of Parnia Abbasi: a young poet, age 23, killed when missiles struck a building. Her poem went viral alongside her image:Iwill end /I burn /I’ll be that extinguished star.On a street where I once bought dictionaries, I saw an elderly woman running between alleyways, calling a name. Neighbours said she had lost a son in the Iran-Iraq war over 30 years ago, and now, with Alzheimer’s, the bombs had awakened some buried memory. She was searching for a child who would never come home – in any language.We were all translating, in our own way: transforming destruction into image, death into verse, grief into search.View image in fullscreenA copy of Colorless Tsukuru Tazaki and His Years of Pilgrimage by Haruki Murakami, translated by Amir Mehdi Haghighat, among the rubble in Tehran, June 2025.Photograph: Erfan BagheriA week after the attacks began, still surrounded by destruction, I found myself translatingMany Moons– James Thurber’s children’s tale of a king whose daughter will recover only if she can hold the moon. Though written for children, it carried profound meaning for me then. Thurber himself, who lost his sight gradually after a childhood accident yet continued creating until the end of his life, understood something about reaching for the impossible. I wondered if the moon was the peace we all longed for – seemingly unattainable, yet still worth reaching toward.During those nights of bombardment, I understood translation as something more than literary craft: it was an act of resistance, of staying put, of holding on.One day, in broad sunlight, blasts hit Evin prison in Tehran; in those same hours, I was translating Lahiri’s passages about the one-time leader of the Italian Communist party, Antonio Gramsci, in his prison cell, asking for more dictionaries, insisting that language study become his “predominant activity”. For Gramsci, translation was – as Lahiri puts it – “a reality, aspiration, discipline, anchor, and metaphor” all at once. He once said that even if he were to be executed, he would spend the night before calmly studying Chinese.And then came the photograph. I spotted it on a news site and saw that, amid the ruins of another apartment block, lay one of my old translations, scarred but intact, my name printed on the cover. The image was in colour, but it might as well have been black and white, drained of life among the concrete and debris. For most of my career, I had been invisible, as all translators are. But here was my work made visible – scarred, but surviving.I stared at the image for a long time. Lahiri writes that “all translation is a political act”, but I had never felt the full weight of this until then. To translate, even under bombardment, was to say: “this voice mattered”. It will not be erased. To translate is not just to haul stories across languages, but to help them remain when everything else falls away. It is a quiet, stubborn refusal to disappear.Explore more on these topicsBooksA moment that changed meIranMiddle East and north AfricafeaturesShareReuse this content"

I’m going to stop wars,”Donald Trumpsaid after declaring victory on 6 November 2024. It wasn’t his first pledge to disengage the US from foreign conflicts, and Trump’s top allies in conservative media and the “Make America Great Again” (Maga) movement have all rallied to his pledge to “put America first”.Now that the US president seems to have broken his pledge by launching an invasion of Venezuela, not to mention threatening future actions against Cuba and Colombia and potentiallyGreenland, some have reasonably wondered whether Trump’s supporters in Maga media would hammer him for that inconsistency.But in the days since the US forcibly abducted Venezuela’s president, Nicolás Maduro, and his wife, with dozens killed as part of the night-time operation, Trump has instead received strong support from his media allies, with a few on-again, off-again backers expressing some reservations.“Generally, the party is going to stand with him on this and conservative media is going to stand with him on this,” former Republican congressman and talk radio host Joe Walsh said.The conservative radio and television host Mark Levin, one of Trump’s strongest media defenders, not only celebrated Trump’s military actions but on Sunday called those who questioned the legality of the incursion, including Senator Bernie Sanders and the New York City mayor, Zohran Mamdani, “pure evil”.“They defend totalitarianism [sic] regimes against our nation’s own security and interests,”he added. Levin and Fox News host Sean Hannity have also championed “The Donroe Doctrine”, the notion that Trump’s America has dominance over the Western hemisphere.The conservative commentator Ben Shapirocalled out thoseon the “so-called isolationalist right” who may oppose the Trump administration’s actions, referring primarily to former Fox News host Tucker Carlson. Shapiro said that Maduro was ousted by “a conservative Republican president, a gutsy president, who makes the calls to preserve America’s national security and her foreign interests”.View image in fullscreenTrump and Carlson on the Tucker Carlson Live Tour in Glendale, Arizona in 2024.Photograph: Patrick T Fallon/AFP/Getty ImagesBut even Carlson expressed cautious optimism inan episode of his streaming showon Monday after Trump gave his backing to Maduro’s former vice-president, Delcy Rodríguez.Carlson said he’s “grateful for the wisdom of not taking out the entire government”, clarifying: “Not because I support the government, but because we have clear models in Iraq and Libya and a lot of Syria: it can be very hard to put those things back together again.” Carlson said it “seems like a much wiser approach” to keep the government structure in place but “making sure it’s pro-American”.“That makes me calm down a bit,” he added.The coverage among opinion hosts on Fox News has also been overwhelmingly positive. Fox News host Laura Ingraham called the capture of Maduro “quintessentially Maga”.“America and the world is a safer, freer place,” Hannity said on Monday night. “And this administration, they are making no apologies, nor should they.“Donald Trump’s like my surgeon: he’s elegant, and he’s precise, and he went in there with the perfect extraction,” Fox News host Jesse Watters said on the Five on Monday. “This is not regime change. This is just trying to change the regime’s behavior.”Not everyone is falling in line. Former Fox News host Megyn Kelly, who now runs her own company and has a radio channel on SiriusXM, mocked the pro-Trump coverage on her former network, even as she re-affirmed her support for the president. “I turned on Fox News yesterday, and I’m sorry, but it was like watching Russian propaganda,” she said on her Monday show. “There was nothing skeptical. It was all rah-rah cheerleading, yes, let’s go. And that’s fine. I love our military as much as anyone, and I believe in President Trump, but there are serious reasons to just exercise a note of caution before we just get on the rah-rah train.” She said Trump’s actions to depose Maduro were clearly about global oil dominance and not “this bullshit about law enforcement”.View image in fullscreenMegyn Kelly and Donald Trump in 2016.Photograph: FOX/FOX Image Collection/Getty ImagesKat Timpf, a libertarian commentator who is a regular panelist on Fox News host Greg Gutfeld’s late-night show, pointed out the inconsistencies in Trump’s past comments about international involvement. “Let me get this straight: we go to a country, we capture their leader, we bomb it, and then we say, ‘We run this country now.’ And that is not war,” she said, “but when they send cocaine over here that people are willingly snorting – that is war? It doesn’t make any sense … I hope I’m wrong. I hope this is suddenly the one regime change that works out well for us and for the people we are supposed to be rescuing, but we do not have a very good track record.” (Timpf said on Xthat she’s received “very brutal personal attacks” from Trump supporters – and from fellow long-term skeptics about foreign interventionism – for expressing concerns about Venezuela.)The conservative media personality Candace Owens, who has emerged as a regular critic of the president, called it a CIA-led “hostile takeover of a country at the behest of a globalist psychopaths”,she wrote in a post on X, adding that “there has never been a single regime change that Zionists have not applauded because it means they get to steal land, oil and other resources.”And Carlson, too, who had long warned against “regime change” in Venezuela, seemed skeptical that the US should be meddling in other Latin-American countries, including Cuba, where Trump seemed to show interest in intervention. “To spend all your time worrying about Cuba? I love the Cubans here. Love them. But how much money do you want to spend out of your kid’s college fund on regime change in Cuba?”On his War Room showon Saturday, Steve Bannon,who prominently opposedthe US pushing for so-called regime change in Iran this summer, called Trump’s move in Venezuela “a stunning and dazzling strike” and a “bold and brilliant raid” – thoughhe has questionedthe long-term consequences.There was also some discord in the Murdoch-controlled print media ecosystem. The New York Post’s editorial board came out strongly in defense of the raid,writing: “Operation Absolute Resolve was stunningly successful, fresh testimony to the tremendous professionalism of America’s servicemen and -women – and of course to the resolve of President Donald Trump.” The Wall Street Journal’s editorial board, however,took a more skeptical perspective, writing on Saturday that it was “odd” that Trump was “so dismissive” of the Venezuelan opposition leader, María Corina Machado. The board also dinged Trump for talking excessively about US interest in Venezuelan oil, “which sends a message that the US purpose is largely mercenary”. On Sunday, the board seemed skeptical about the possibility of Venezuela’s current leadership remaining in place. “The Trump Administration talks about its foreign-policy ‘realism’,”they wrote. “But if Maduro 2.0 remains in defiant power in six months, its gamble on his henchmen won’t look very realistic.”Walsh, a former supporter of the Tea Party movement who left the House of Representatives in 2013, knows the price of standing in opposition to Trump. Hehad his radio show cancelled by Salem Radio Networkin 2019 after he became a critic of Trump and announced a primary challenge.“To be in rightwing media, it became clear when he first won, you either get on the train, or you don’t. It’s still that way,” he said in an interview. “If 100% of the audience came out against what Trump did in Venezuela, you’d see these people move, but that’s not going to happen.”Explore more on these topicsRepublicansUS attack on VenezuelaDonald TrumpanalysisShareReuse this content"

The Russian foreign ministry has demanded the US ensure the humane and dignified treatment of Russian citizens onboard the Marinera and guarantee their swift return to Russia.Leavitt said: “The president has very good, open relationships with both President Putin and President Xi. He has spoken with them numerous times … and I believe those personal relationships are going to continue.”View image in fullscreenA screengrab from footage published by Russian state media purporting to show a US helicopter approaching the Marinera on Wednesday.Photograph: XThe Marinera had been navigating in the Atlantic between Iceland and the UK, according to ship-tracking data from MarineTraffic. TheWall Street Journal reportedthat several helicopters and at least one coastguard vessel were used to take control of the tanker.Britain provided support to the US in its operation, the Ministry of Defence said in a statement.The Kremlin’s immediate reaction to the seizure has been notably muted, with Moscow appearing to continue its efforts to improve ties with Washington under Trump in the hope of securing his favour in talks over Ukraine.Russia’s transport ministry said in a statement that US forces had boarded the vessel outside the territorial waters of any state and that contact with it had been lost.The ministry cited the 1982 UN convention on the law of the sea, which says “no state has the right to use force against vessels duly registered in the jurisdictions of other states”.US aircraft monitor tanker off Ireland that tried to evade Venezuela blockadeRead moreThe US defence secretary, Pete Hegseth, wrote on X: “The blockade of sanctioned and illicit Venezuelan oil remains in FULL EFFECT – anywhere in the world.”The pursuit of the Marinera began after it turned back into the Atlantic while travelling from Iran to Venezuela, having attempted to evade a US blockade targeting sanction-hit oil tankers operating near Venezuelan waters.Marinera route mapThe operation is likely to strain relations with Vladimir Putin, coming at a sensitive moment as negotiations over a potential peace deal in Ukraine continue and after the US capture of Venezuela’s president, Nicolás Maduro, a longstanding Kremlin ally.Ukraine’s foreign minister said Kyiv welcomed the seizure of the tanker, adding it was a good example of how to act against Moscow and said it showcased “President Trump’s resolute leadership”.“We welcome such an approach to dealing with Russia: act, not fear. This is also relevant to the peace process and bringing a lasting peace closer,” Andrii Sybiha wrote on X.The vessel is part of the so-calledshadow fleetmoving oil for Russia, Iran and Venezuela. It was placed under sanctions by the US in 2024 over allegations it carried illicit cargo for a Hezbollah-owned company.Initial reports suggest the ageing tanker is empty, having been en route to pick up Venezuelan oil before changing course. Even so, Moscow appears to have gone to considerable lengths to protect the vessel, raising questions about why it is willing to risk a standoff with the west over it.The Wall Street Journal reported late on Tuesday that the Russian navy had deployed a submarine to escort the tanker, heightening the stakes of any confrontation in the North Atlantic.In the 24 hours preceding the operation, western surveillance flights were observed over the vessel, including aircraft from US bases in Iceland, and RAF Rivet Joint and P-8 Poseidon planes from the UK, which are capable of detecting submarines.View image in fullscreenA handout photo from US European Command shows the Marinera.Photograph: @US_EUCOM/X/PAIn December, the crew repelled an attempted US boarding near Venezuelan waters. The vessel was subsequently renamed from Bella 1 to Marinera, a Russian flag was painted on its hull and it was added to Russia’s official shipping registry. Moscow later lodged a formal diplomatic protest demanding that Washington halt its pursuit.The tanker departed the Gulf of Oman in November, transiting the Suez canal and the strait of Gibraltar before crossing the Atlantic in early December. As US pressure on Venezuela intensified – culminating in thecapture of Maduro– the vessel stopped abruptly near the Caribbean on 15 December and reversed course, heading back towards Europe.Marinera’s return journey across the Atlantic has been markedly atypical, according to marine transport experts. Instead of taking the usual route through the Channel, the tanker veered sharply north, steering into the stretch of ocean between Iceland and Ireland.Mikhail Zvinchuk, an influential military blogger with close ties to Russia’s defence ministry, said the decision to reflag the vessel under Russian jurisdiction shortly before its seizure had placed Moscow in an extremely awkward position.He said the move “sets a precedent for further operations against Russia’s so-called shadow fleet, not only in the Atlantic but in other regions of the world as well”.Registry data reviewedby the New York Timesshowed that at least three other oil tankers that had operated in Venezuelan waters in recent weeks had since been reflagged under the Russian banner, pointing to a growing trend of Moscow extending its registry to vessels facing US sanctions.The move could complicate relations between Moscow and Washington at a time when Trump has shown frustration with Putin over Russia’s continued fighting in Ukraine.Explore more on these topicsUS foreign policyRussiaVenezuelaEuropeAmericasUS attack on VenezuelanewsShareReuse this content"

Rejecting the authority of the acting president, backed – for now – by the US, she said she expected new elections to be called quickly. “In free and fair elections, we will win more than 90% of the votes,” she told Fox News this week.Also on Wednesday, the USseizeda Russian-flagged oil tanker in the Atlantic and a second vessel in the Caribbean, as the defence secretary, Pete Hegseth,postedthat America “continues to enforce the blockade against all dark-fleet vessels illegally transporting Venezuelan oil to finance illicit activity, stealing from the Venezuelan people”.Venezuela to continue supplying oil to US ‘indefinitely’, White House saysRead moreMeanwhile, US officials have told Cabello through intermediaries that if he proves defiant, he could face a fate similar to Maduro’s, according to Reuters.Cabello, for his part, haspostedvideos on social media showing him commanding dozens of heavily armed men patrolling the streets of Caracas. He controls the police, counterintelligence agencies and the militias known ascolectivos.“It’s calm, it’s tranquil. Your conscious people know what we must do, working to restore the normality that should prevail in the country and get back to work. Today, shops opened without any problems,” Cabello says in one video, pointing to a clock showing 11pm on Tuesday.He is also seen taking photos and shaking hands with civilians and shopkeepers, and making a speakerphone call with what appears to be another commander, asking how things are. “In battle, my commander, in battle, my captain. Defending our homeland,” comes the reply.In another clip, dozens of armed men pose for the camera with rifles raised and fists clenched, chanting “Always loyal, never traitors!” and “To doubt is to betray!” – the same slogan emblazoned on Cabello’s cap, which he also wore at Rodríguez’s swearing-in ceremony on Monday, a gesture interpreted by some as a sign of resentment at not being placed in charge and a warning that any concessions to the US would be seen as a betrayal ofChavismo.Cabello has a long history of rivalry with Rodríguez and her brother, Jorge Rodríguez, the president of the Venezuelan congress. Although many considered him the regime’s second most powerful figure after Maduro, analysts emphasise that there was noclear hierarchy. Power was divided among factions – one dominated by Cabello, another by the Rodríguez siblings, among others – that coexisted and competed.Cabello was among the officers who took part in Hugo Chávez’s failed coup attempt in 1992 and is therefore regarded as a “core”Chavista.The interior minister is also widely seen as one of those most responsible for the Maduro regime’s extensive and well-documented human rights abuses, which included more than 20,000 extrajudicial killings, enforced disappearances and torture, and the jailing of thousands of political opponents.Since Monday, thecolectivosunder his command have been patrolling streets, operating checkpoints and checking people’s phones in a crackdown aimed at consolidating authority after the US attack.The regime has issued a decree declaring a “state of external commotion” – in effect a state of emergency – ordering the “immediate search and capture of anyone involved in the promotion or support of the US armed attack”. At least 16 journalists and media workers were detained, 14 in Caracas and two near the Colombian border, with 15 later released, one of whom was deported.On Tuesday the acting president declared seven days of national mourning for those killed in what was the first large-scale US military attack on South American soil.Rodríguez also named Gen Gustavo González López as the new commander of the presidential honour guard, replacing Maj Gen Javier Marcano Tábata. Although Tábata survived the operation that captured Maduro, in which at least 24 Venezuelan soldiers and 32 Cubans were killed, most of them part of Maduro’s personal security detail, his position was said to have become untenable amid criticism over an alleged failure to prevent his leader’s capture.The acting president also hardened her rhetoric against Washington, saying in a televised address that “no external agent governs Venezuela” – a clear rebuttal to Trump’s claim that, after Maduro’s capture, the US would run the country.The remarks marked a shift from theconciliatory toneshe had adopted on Sunday, as she returned to harsher language, describing the US strike as a “terrible military aggression” and a “criminal attack” whose “absolutely illegal outcome, in violation of international law”, was the “kidnapping” of Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores.Explore more on these topicsVenezuelaTrump administrationUS foreign policyDelcy RodríguezNicolás MaduroUS politicsAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

The outcome will decide whether the vast mineral wealth of South America is directed towards a 21st-century energy transition or a buildup of military power to defend 20th-century fossil fuel interests.Although this onslaught was ostensibly aimed at one corrupt dictatorship in a miserably dysfunctional country, the ramifications are far wider.Venezuela’s oil is the obvious – but not the only – objective. When the former Guardian journalist Seumas Milne and Iinterviewed Nicolás Maduroin 2014, Maduro warned of the lengths the US was willing to go to “get their hands on Venezuelan oil”. The country’s Orinoco Belt contains easily the biggest reserves in the world – more than 300bn barrels, a fifth of global stock. Donald TrumpsaidUS companies would tap these fossil fuels and “start making money for the country”.That would worsen the already dire climate crisis. It also makes little economic sense. Venezuelaproduces heavy, sour oil, which is hard to refine, though it is suitable for asphalt. After decades of sanctions, underinvestment and mismanagement, the industry’s infrastructure is woeful. On a visit to the Orinoco Belt, I saw old, rusting facilities and heard of sharply falling output. Even before the US naval quarantine, this meant Venezuela ranked 22nd among the world’s oil exporters. Fixing that would take many years and cost tens of billions of dollars, an investment that would not easily be recouped at a time when oil prices are low as a result of surging US production and even cheaper wind and solar energy. When much of the world is transitioning to renewables, Washington would almost have to force this oil down people’s throats.View image in fullscreenA flame burns natural gas at an heavy-crude treatment plant near Cabrutica in the state of Anzoategui, in the Orinoco belt where output is said to be falling sharply.Photograph: Carlos García Rawlins/ReutersUS petroleum majors are already expanding in the offshore oilfields of Guyana, Venezuela’s Amazonian neighbour. Maduro’sefforts to claim those resourcesmay have sealed his fate. But his show trial is also designed to send a message to neighbouring leaders that the region is now in thrall to Washington. In case anyone missed that point, the US state department released asocial media poston 5 January declaring: “This is our hemisphere.”It is also evident in the Trump administration’s latestnational security strategy, published in November, which for the first time barely mentioned Russia and focused overwhelmingly on “threats” from the Americas: migration, crime (including narcotics) and supply chain disruptions.“The United States must never be dependent on any outside power for core components – from raw materials to parts to finished products – necessary to the nation’s defense or economy,” it noted. “We must resecure our own independent and reliable access to the goods we need to defend ourselves and preserve our way of life. This will require expanding American access to critical minerals and materials.”The strategy explicitly aims to eject foreign rivals from other countries. “The terms of our alliances, and the terms upon which we provide any kind of aid, must be contingent on winding down adversarial outside influence – from control of military installations ports, and key infrastructure to the purchase of strategic assets broadly defined.”Although this “adversarial outside influence” is not named, it is clearly China, which overtook the US as the main trading partner of Latin America during the commodities boom in the first decade of this century. China now buys more oil fromVenezuela, more iron, soy and beef from Brazil, more copper from Chile, Peru and Bolivia, and more ferroalloys from Colombia.View image in fullscreenLithium mining in the Atacama desert; Chile, Peru and Colombia are thought to have important deposits of rare earths, though Bolivia has the world’s biggest known lithium deposits.Photograph: Martin Bernetti/AFP/Getty ImagesOf particular concern to the US is China’s global chokehold on critical minerals. Last year, China threatened to withhold exports of these commodities, which are essential for renewable energy technology, weapons systems and artificial intelligence. South American nations could reduce that risk. Brazil has the world’s second biggest deposits of critical minerals, according to the US Geological Survey, and is already the leading producer of niobium, needed for high-grade steel. Bolivia has the world’s biggest known deposits of lithium, essential in electric car batteries. Chile, Peru andColombiaare also thought to have important deposits of rare earths.But so far China has invested the most in processing facilities and transport infrastructure in South America, while the US under Trump has imposed tariffs. This has exacerbated the shift in trade of these future-shaping goods from north-south to east-west.The US is now trying to reverse that situation with military force and political interference in the Americas, with the biggestUS military buildupin the Caribbean Sea in generations.It has been cheered by a handful of rightwing regional leaders, such as Argentina’s Javier Milei, who relies on US financial support to stabilise his country’s currency, and Ecuador’s president, the tycoon Daniel Noboa, who is trying toweaken limits on extractive activitiesin his country and wants to construct a US military base on the Galápagos Islands, a Unesco world heritage site and biosphere reserve.View image in fullscreenMilitary vehicles park on the Tienditas Bridge crossing between Venezuela and Colombia after the US strikes.Photograph: Luisa González/ReutersA very different response was expressed by the governments of Mexico, Brazil, Colombia, Uruguay and Cuba, who condemned the US muscle flexing as a challenge to regional stability. Several of their leaders, many of whom are trying to engage in multinational efforts to deal with the climate and nature crisis, haveexpressed fearsthat Washington will now try to interfere in their domestic politics.The Colombian president, Gustavo Petro, a global climate champion, hasmobilised armed forcesto his country’s border with Venezuela after the US strikes andvowed to take up armsif the threats intensify. He is up for re-election this year, and supporters say he is already the target of a misinformation and intimidation campaign by the White House.“Colombia is very sick too, run by a sick man who likes making cocaine and selling it to the US,” Trump said in the wake of Maduro’s kidnapping, without providing any evidence of the allegation. “He’s not going to be doing it very long.” Along with Cuba and Greenland, this puts Colombia high on the list of where the US might target next.Brazil’s leftwing president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, who alsofaces re-electionthis year, has already felt Trump’s wrath. Last year, Lula criticised the US leader for behaving like an emperor. Trump responded by raising US tariffs on Brazilian goods to 50%.This backfired. Lula’s popularity rating improved as voters rallied against this threat to their nation. And US industries and hi-tech companies had to remind their president that they needed Brazil’s critical minerals.‘Naked imperialism’: how Trump intervention in Venezuela is a return to form for the USRead moreThis is, of course, not the first time the US hasthrown its weight aroundin this region, but it takes place in a more dangerous context. The world faces an unprecedented threat from climate disruption and nature breakdown, which means it is more important than ever to protect biodiversity and ensure that the world’s limited supply of critical minerals is primarily used for the energy transition.Many leaders in South America are trying to do this, but Trump is now using armed force to try to push the region in the opposite direction – to open the oil spigots wider and ensure rare earths and other important resources go north to the US, where they are likely to be used to strengthen the world’s biggest military, rather than west to China, theworld’s biggest manufacturerof solar panels, windfarms and electric cars.In terms of the wellbeing of the world and the majority of its people, this is clearly a horrifying mistake. But theTrump administrationhas narrower goals. Its strategy document says the US priority is to secure the “God-given natural rights of its citizens”. Many of them will probably be appalled by this action, but a powerful elite around Trump is calling the shots. Rather than international cooperation on global challenges, they would rather build walls and asset-strip their neighbours for supplies.Thisdoomsday bunker mentalitywill be bad news for democracy, people and the environment. But it is far from certain of achieving its goals. South America will not easily accept being the pantry, mineral deposit and fuel tank of the Armageddon shelter in the north.Explore more on these topicsOilView from the AmazonCritical mineralsFossil fuelsVenezuelaTrump administrationUS foreign policyAmericasanalysisShareReuse this content"

The US energy secretary, Chris Wright, said the US would take payment for the oil and use the proceeds “to benefit the Venezuelan people”.Trump claims Venezuela is set for an oil boom after US attack – history points to a bumpy road aheadRead more“We’re going to market the crude coming out of Venezuela,” Wright said. “First this backed-up store of oil, and then indefinitely going forward we will sell the production that comes out of Venezuela in the marketplace.”Wright set out the plans for long-term control of Venezuela’s oil industry as the US seized a Russian-flagged oil tanker that had been on course to travel to Venezuela from Iran before it turned back towards the Atlantic.The vessel, the Marinera,previously known as the Bella 1, is understood to be part of ashadow fleetmoving oil for Russia, Iran and Venezuela, and the high-stakes operation is likely to risk confrontation with the Kremlin after Moscow reportedly dispatched a submarine to safeguard the vessel.A second tanker, the Sophia, was later seized in the Caribbean. The US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, said Venezuela’s interim leaders had asked for the oil cargo seized on the ship to be “part of this deal”.“They want the oil that was seized on one of those ships to be part of the deal. They understand that the only way they can move oil and generate revenue and not have economic collapse is if they work with the United States,” he said.Late on Wednesday, the US vice president, JD Vance, told Fox News’ Jesse Watters Primetime show that Venezuela could only sell its oil if it served US interests.He said: “We control the energy resources, and we tell the regime you’re allowed to sell the oil so long as you serve America’s national interest, you’re not allowed to sell it if you can’t serve America’s national interest.”A continuing supply of crude from Venezuela could act as a drag on oil prices, which last year recorded theirsteepest annual fallsince the Covid pandemic and could plummet further as oil producers continue to pump more than is needed by the global economy.Global oil prices fell on Wednesday, although they recovered some ground in morning trading in New York. The international benchmark, Brent crude, fell to just over $60 a barrel on Wednesday, while the US oil price was down by 0.5%, at $60.39 a barrel, after falling below $56 earlier.The oil grab also raises the prospect of disruption to Venezuela’s oil exports to China, which takes about 80% of its crude exports, potentially forcing Beijing to pay higher prices for its crude and increasing tensions with the White House.China’s foreign ministry said on Wednesday that Venezuela “enjoys full and permanent sovereignty over its natural resources and economic activities”, and US demands for the country to hand over its oil “violate international law, infringe upon Venezuela’s sovereignty, and harm the rights of the Venezuelan people”.In a post on his Truth Social platform late on Tuesday,Donald Trumpsaid: “That money will be controlled by me, as President … It will be taken by storage ships, and brought directly to unloading docks in the United States.”Oil graphicTrump has said he wants Venezuela’s interim president, Delcy Rodríguez, to give the US and private companies “total access” to Venezuela’s oil industry. He said Wright was in charge of executing the deal, adding that the oil would be taken from ships and sent directly to US ports.Wright told a Goldman Sachs energy conference in Miami on Wednesday: “If we control the flow of oil and the flow of the cash that comes from those sales, we have large leverage. We need … control of those oil sales to drive the changes that simply must happen.”The state oil company Petróleos de Venezuela SA (PDVSA), which under a decree issued during Hugo Chávez’s presidency holds at least a 51% stake and operational control over all exploration fields, released a statement saying it was “moving forward with negotiations for the sale of crude volumes to the US”.In the statement, shared across the regime’s official Telegram channels, PDVSA said the “process is being carried out under schemes similar to those in place with international companies such as Chevron”. Even before last Saturday’s strike, the US company already held about 25% of operations in Venezuela, with PDVSA controlling 50%, about 20% split between joint ventures with China and Russia, and 5% held by European companies.PDVSA said the talks with the US were “based on a strictly commercial transaction, guided by criteria of legality, transparency and mutual benefit”, and it reiterated “its commitment to building partnerships that drive national development in favour of the Venezuelan people and contribute to global energy stability”.After Saturday morning’s attack on Caracas led to thecapture of Nicolás Maduro, Trump vowed that US companies wouldreignite Venezuela’s struggling oil industry.US oil executives from Chevron, ConocoPhillips and ExxonMobil are expected to meet Trump at the White House on Friday to discuss plans to pour billions of dollars into the industry in Venezuela.Chevron is the only US oil company that still operates in the country, after the assets of ConocoPhillips and Exxon were nationalised by the former president Hugo Chávez in the mid-2000s, a move Trump has described as “the greatest theft in the history of America”.The US oil majors have so fardeclined to outline publiclyany such plans for investment and there is scepticism that big listed companies would be willing to invest in a politically unstable region amid falling global oil prices without iron-clad guarantees that their investments would be protected.There is also scepticism over whether Venezuela, which holds the world’s largest reserves of crude, could once again produce meaningful amounts after years of neglect and corruption that caused its output to fall from highs of 3.5m barrels of oil a day 25 years ago to about 1m bpd – or less than 1% of the global market.The multibillion-dollar investment needed to increase Venezuela’s oil production to the levels of its heyday in the late 1990s could require 15 years of work to repair the country’s degraded infrastructure and capital spending of up to $185bn, according to analysis by Rystad Energy, a global consultancy.The US Department of State was approached for comment.Explore more on these topicsOilDonald TrumpVenezuelaAmericasCommoditiesTrump administrationOil and gas companiesnewsShareReuse this content"

The laws wererushed through parliamentlast month after the Bondi massacre.In December, PAG organiser Josh Lees accused the government of stripping away the right to peaceful protest with “no evidence at all” that it would make anyone safer.Wednesday’s challenge comes after the NSW police commissioner, Mal Lanyon,announced on Tuesdaythat a 14-day declaration made under the powerson Christmas Evefor Sydney’s CBD, south-west and north-west policing areas would be extended until 20 January. He cited ongoing community safety concerns, but said no further intelligence had come to light to motivate the move.Albanese softens resistance to royal commission into Bondi attack as pressure mountsRead moreThe groups have expressed concern that the declaration, which can be extended for a total of 90 days, could affect expected Invasion Day rallies on 26 January. Asked about the possibility on Tuesday, Lanyon said it was “very premature to consider that”.The NSW premier, Chris Minns, who has described civil liberties concerns as “overblown”, has said the government was “alive to the threat” of a challenge, but “confident that the laws will withstand a constitutional challenge”.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailConstitutional law expertshave expressed uncertaintyabout the success of a challenge against the powers, which do not prohibit public assemblies outright, but prevent their authorisation under NSW’s form 1 system. Authorised protests provide protection from prosecutions for offences such as obstructing pedestrians and traffic.The premier and police commissioner have insisted the laws do not restrict “peaceful” and static assemblies, but the groups have argued the changes, which also give police move-on powers at unauthorised protests, effectively ban all protests.After the extension of the declaration on Tuesday, the president of the NSW Council for Civil Liberties, Timothy Roberts, told Guardian Australia the laws were creating an “extraordinary chilling effect, sitting in the shadow of police discretion about what protests are and aren’t appropriate”.This is the latest challenge against protest laws introduced by the Minns government.In October, the NSW supreme court ruled a law that gave police the power move on protesters “in or near” a place of worship was unconstitutional, after a challenge launched by PAG.The groupsuccessfully appealeda police decision not to authorise a march on the Sydney Harbour Bridge in August, althoughthey lost an appealagainst a prohibition on a march to the Opera House forecourt in October, with the court citing “extreme” safety concerns.A court date for the challenge could be decided at a preliminary hearing inSydneyscheduled for Thursday.Explore more on these topicsAustralia newsSydneyNew South WalesProtestBondi beach terror attacknewsShareReuse this content"

Rather, genetic changes had allowed the strain to spread rapidly, even as vaccines continued to protect against severe illness.Super-K has now spread to more than 30 other countries.According to data from theNational Notifiable Disease Surveillance System, 284 influenza infections in Australia over the past seven days had occurred in children aged four and younger.Prof Ian Barr, the deputy director of the WorldHealthOrganization Collaborating Centre for Reference and Research on Influenza, told Guardian Australia that genetic mapping suggested Super-K originated in insignificant numbers in the US in mid-2025.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailThe strain began appearing in Australia in August. By October it had taken hold and by mid-November weekly emergency department presentations for influenza-like illness had spiked to more than 370 people in New South Wales alone, according todata from NSW Health.More than one-third of Australia’s cases had been reported in NSW in the past seven days.And, as most people who contract the flu do not get tested, that figure may be a small proportion of the population infected, the state health minister, Ryan Park, said.Yetvaccination rates have been plummetingamong those most vulnerable, the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners said.In 2025 only 25.7% of children aged six months to five years were vaccinated, the lowest since 2021, and rates for those over the age of 65 slipped to 60.5%, a five-year low.By mid-December, theNSW Respiratory Surveillance Reportwas recording more than 3,000 laboratory-confirmed notifications a week – an alarming 15% week-on-week increase during a month when flu viruses typically go into hibernation.“It does seem to be a very fit virus,” Barr said. “Normally we wouldn’t see viruses taking off that late in the season … and we’re still getting a reasonable number of cases even now in January.”Health authorities, beginning with a national Australian Health Protection Committee (AHPC) alert on 12 December, had stressed that Super-K does not appear to be more severe than previous H3N2 strains; it was simply much more efficient at finding new hosts.But given its unseasonable persistence, its spread could place pressure on national healthcare resources over the holiday period, the AHPC warned.Australians travelling to the northern hemisphere are advised to get an influenza vaccine dose ahead of travel.The Australian Centre for Disease Control said Australia’s influenza season typically peaked during winter, from June to September.“Current case numbers for influenza are higher than usual for this time of year compared to previous seasons,” a spokesperson said.Barr said the good news was that research coming out of the EU suggested the effectiveness of the old flu vaccine on the new Super-K virus had been “surprisingly better than expected”.In children it was found to be 72.8% effective in keeping them out of hospital once contracting Super-K, and for 18 to 64-year-olds 66.3% effective. Like most other viruses, however, the over-65 group took a sudden dive – 31.7% effective.The data showed the current influenza vaccination was still the best form of protection available against Super-K, Barr said.Explore more on these topicsHealthFlunewsShareReuse this content"

They’ve often been very open about ruling things in and basically broadcasting their foreign policy strategy to the rest of the world – not just to our allies, but most egregiously to our adversaries. That’s not something this president does.“All options are always on the table … But I will just say that the president’s first option always has been diplomacy.”Leavitt was also pressed on what the US would gain by controling Greenland that it did not have already in its access to military bases there. “More control over the Arctic region and ensuring that China and Russia and our adversaries cannot continue their aggression in this very important and strategic region,” she said.TheUK’s prime minister, Keir Starmer, “set out his position on Greenland” in a phone conversation with Trump on Wednesday evening, Downing Street said without giving further details of the call.Starmer has repeatedly said the territory’s future must be a matter for Greenland and Denmark alone, including in the Commons earlier on Wednesday.Trump said on Wednesday that the US would not desert Nato in a backhanded social media post that also criticised the alliance.“We will always be there for Nato, even if they won’t be there for us,” he wrote on Truth Social. Russia and China would “have zero fear” of Nato without the US, he said. Addressing “all of those big Nato fans”, he added: “They were at 2% GDP, and most weren’t paying their bills, UNTIL I CAME ALONG.”After one of Trump’s leading aides said on Tuesday that the US may be willing to seize control of the Arctic territory by force, European leaders rallied around Denmark and Greenland with a rare rebuke to the White House, declaring that Greenland “belongs to its people”.Barrot said that in a phone call on Tuesday Rubio had told him that he had “ruled out the possibility of an invasion” of Greenland. “I myself was on the phone yesterday with Marco Rubio … who confirmed that this was not the approach taken,” he said.Trump has long expressed an interest in acquiring Greenland. But in recent days, after the US military operation in Venezuela on Saturday in whichtroops removed the country’s president, Nicolás Maduro, the Trump administration’s rhetoric – and, subsequently, international tensions – have ramped up to new heights, putting the survival of Nato into question.On Tuesday night, the Danish parliament held an extraordinary meeting to discuss the unprecedented situation.Lars Løkke Rasmussen, the Danish foreign minister, and his Greenlandic counterpart, Vivian Motzfeldt, said they were seeking an urgent meeting with Rubio to discuss Greenland. “We would like to add some nuance to the conversation,” Rasmussen said on social media. “The shouting match must be replaced by a more sensible dialogue. Now.”Trump has claimed that Greenland is “full of Chinese and Russian ships” and that Denmark is incapable of defending Greenland, which the president has said is vital for US national security.But Rasmussen said after the extraordinary meeting that the US was giving a false representation of what was happening in Greenland. “The image that is being painted of Russian and Chinese ships right inside the Nuuk fjord and massive Chinese investments being made is not correct,” he said.The situation, Rasmussen said, was “based on a misreading of what is up and what is down”, adding: “We are looking after the kingdom.”Denmark’s defence minister, Troels Lund Poulsen, disputed US claims that the country was not doing enough to protect Greenland. “We have invested close to 100bn [Danish kroner] (£11.6bn) in security capabilities,” he said.Explore more on these topicsGreenlandDenmarkFranceUS foreign policyDonald TrumpTrump administrationEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

It had no oil onboard – but was it carrying Russian weapons?ByTural Ahmedzade,Harvey Symons,Oliver HolmesandDan SabbaghWed 7 Jan 2026 11.56 ESTLast modified on Wed 7 Jan 2026 21.30 ESTShareAmassive, rusty crude oil tanker floating north through the Atlantic has become the centre of global interest after it was followed for days and eventuallyseized by US forceswhile Russia’s military rushed towards it.Despite not carrying any oil, the 300-metre-long ship is clearly of value. Theories for why range from speculation that high-value Russian weapons are hidden in the hull, to the ship’s potential to become a symbolic trophy in a transatlantic power struggle between Washington and Moscow.Currently called the Marinera, the ship is alleged to be part of the shadow or “ghost” fleets used by Russia, Iran andVenezuelato avoid western sanctions. For years these vessels have moved cargo and cheap fuel around the globe, including to China.Washington and its European allies have long sought to crack down on the illicit maritime trade. Those efforts reached a critical point last month after Donald Trumpimposed a naval blockade on sanctions-busting tankersoperating near Venezuela, home to the world’s largest oil reserves and a key destination for shadow fleet vessels.The Marinera is among the dozen or so oil tankers that have been trying to escape the blockade. It evaded capture in the Caribbean Sea in December, changed its name from Bella 1 and switched course towards northern Russia before being boarded on Wednesday as it sailed in the frigid Atlantic.Marinera route mapThe Marinera has been under sanctions from the US treasurysince June 2024over accusations of carrying illicit cargo for Hezbollah, an Iranian-backed Lebanese militant group.The US Coast Guard attempted to board it in the Caribbean in December as it headed for Venezuela, but the ship’s crew refused.View image in fullscreenA member of the US Coast Guard observing a Venezuela-linked oil tanker.Photograph: @US_EUCOM/X/PAThere is precedent for the US boarding shadow fleet ships. Last month, US special forces rappelled from helicopters toboard the Skipper,a tanker off Venezuela that the US treasury had placed under sanctions in 2022. On Wednesday, US Coast Guard members were seen boarding a tanker in international waters near the Caribbean.US forces board the M Sophia in a pre-dawn operation in the CaribbeanUS forces board the M Sophia in a pre-dawn operation in the CaribbeanBut doing the same on the Marinera is very different and has much higher stakes. While the Skipper was sailing under the flag of Guyana, the Marinera is Russian registered and flagged.That is a recent development: the tanker’s crew hurriedly painted a Russian flag on the hull last month. Moscow later lodged a formal diplomatic protest demanding that Washington halt its high-seas pursuit.It is not the only tanker operating in Venezuelan waters to be reflagged under the Russian banner in recent weeks. By putting its own flag on some former shadow fleet tankers, Moscow has in effect moved shadow fleet vessels out of the shadows, in an open challenge to the west.Craig Kennedy, an associate at Harvard University’s Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies, said the decision by Moscow to register the ship could have been an attempt to gain leverage by circumventing the US oil blockade on Venezuela.“To seize a Russian-flagged ship on the high seas is to disregard Russia’s claims of exclusive jurisdiction over the vessel,” said Kennedy, adding that Moscow may have assumed the US would not board a Russian-flagged vessel.Russian state media footage allegedly shows a US helicopter approaching the oil tanker in European waters.Photograph: XBut the Kremlin miscalculated how far Trump would go, Kennedy said. Last weekend, US forces carried out a pre-dawncapture of Venezuela’s president, Nicolás Maduro, and his wife, Cilia Flores, who are now on trial in New York.“This was Russia trying to gain leverage by intervening in the US blockade,” Kennedy said. “And then it backfired.”Other theories suggest there may be something of value to Moscow within the ship. While it is empty of oil, the route it previously took between Iran and Venezuela is suspected of being a path for illicit trade, including for weapons.Upping the stakes, Russia this week dispatched naval assets, including a submarine, to escort the tanker, according to the Wall Street Journal. That was reported hours before US forces boarded the ship, when Washington announced the ship had been seized for “violations of US sanctions”.For days, US surveillance planes had been monitoring the ship, and a British Royal Air Force spy plane appears to have flown over its path. Flight-tracking platforms showed an RAF RC-135W Rivet Joint surveillance plane leaving the Waddington airbase in Lincolnshire on Tuesday towards the same area of the Atlantic as the ship.The UK military said itprovided “pre-planned operational support, including basing”. And in recent days tracking data and spotters had shown a sudden influx of US military, including the C-17 Globemaster III, which can carry helicopters, raising speculation about an imminent special operations mission against the Marinera.Speaking before US forces boarded the ship, John Foreman, a former UK defence attache to Moscow, said the scale of the US monitoring of the tanker and apparent preparations for its seizure by moving aircraft to the nearby UK was eye-catching.“Why have the US put all these assets into the UK just for some oil tanker?” said the former official, now a defence analyst. “Could it be Russian arms going to Venezuela?”Explore more on these topicsWater transportRussiaVenezuelaEuropeShipping industryexplainersShareReuse this content"

The tanker, he told MPs in the evening, had changed its name “five times in the last five years” and had been falsely flying the flag of Guyana when it was called Bella 1 and arrived in the Caribbean.A stateless vessel, the defence secretary said, “may be lawfully intercepted and subjected to the law of the interdicting state”. Stateless ships are generally considered to be without protection under international law, althoughthere is debateabout the extent to which they can be boarded or seized.The Marinera was also, the minister said, part “of an increasing web of shadow shipping that fuels and funds instability” and that “Russia operates a vast shadow fleet of its own to bankroll its illegal invasion of Ukraine”. Stopping such ships from trading covertly was hurting Russia’s war effort, he added.The UK had decided to assist in response to a request from the US for help, the defence secretary said. But British forces only played a supporting role and no British forces took part in the boarding, Healey told MPs on Wednesday evening.James Cartlidge, the Conservative defence spokesperson, said his party supported the seizure of the vessel, while the LibDems called for the government to clarify if it was legal under international law. Ellie Chowns, for the Greens, asked why “has our government deemed it prudent to hang onUS militarycoattails on Wednesday?” and asked if stronger economic sanctions could have been placed on the shadow fleet.The Bella 1 was sailing towards Venezuela at the end of December, but rapidly reversed course after it was approached by the US Coast Guard. The tanker was hastily renamed as the Marinera and placed under a Russian flag in an effort to deter its seizure, but this did not put off the US.Bella 1 had been under sanctions by the US Treasury since July 2024, accused by the American authorities of being involved in carrying illicit cargo for a company owned byHezbollah, the Iranian-backed Lebanese group. It is not thought to be carrying oil, prompting speculation as to whether it could be carrying nefarious cargo.Russian state media footage purports to show a US helicopter approaching the Marinera on Wednesday.Photograph: XDirect British help on Wednesday included the provision of the RFA Tideforce, a Royal Navy utility vessel that provides fuel, water and other military supplies. Flight records also show an RAF Rivet Joint surveillance plane flying to and from the Atlantic north of Ireland on Tuesday.The US military’s European Command posted on social media thanking the UK “for your unwavering support during the US operation to seize the M/V Bella”.Flight records showed the Marinera appears to have been closely monitored this week by US P-8 surveillance aircraft flying from RAF Mildenhall in Suffolk as it crossed the Atlantic a few hundred miles west of Ireland. The surveillance was part of what appeared to be an intense US effort to seize the tanker.A series of US C-17 transport flights into RAF Fairford in Gloucestershire in the past 36 hours had prompted speculation they were carrying helicopters that could be used by US special forces to take the ship. Two AC-130 gunshipswere also filmed arriving at Mildenhallon Sunday.Data collected by TankerTrackers, a specialist monitor, showed Bella 1 had transported 7.3m barrels of Iranian crude oil and 3.7m barrels of Venezuelan crude oil to China between October 2021 and September 2025.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

But in recent days the windup radio – with its inbuilt torch and charge point – has come into its own during Germany’s longest power cut since the second world war.Leftwing anarchist militants haveclaimed responsibilityfor an arson attack on Saturday that cut the electricity to about 45,000 households, almost 2,000 businesses, four hospitals, 74 care homes, 20 schools and a considerable chunk of the public transport network in south-west Berlin.Federal state prosecutors have taken over the criminal investigation into the saboteurs, Vulkangruppe (Volcano Group), who said their aim was to “turn off the juice of those in power” and to highlight Germany’s overdependence on fossil fuels. Aside from some footprints left in the snow, investigators admit they have little to go on so far.View image in fullscreenAcross Berlin there has been an outpouring of goodwill towards those who lost power.Photograph: Clemens Bilan/EPAOn Wednesday morning the remaining 20,000 households and 850 businesses still without heating or hot water were finally reconnected. But many Germans still feel they are without answers to three vital questions: who was responsible, how could the infrastructure of Europe’s largest economy prove so vulnerable, and how can authorities prevent such an attack from happening again?“What is wrong with this city?” an anguished middle-aged man was heard asking on camera as Berlin’s mayor, Kai Wegner, dropped in on a sports hall housing residents on army camp beds.

The army was brought in to distribute diesel to clinics running emergency generators and to help with repairs.When Berlin’s energy and economy senator, Franziska Giffey, turned up on Monday to see the fallout for herself, she could hardly hide her embarrassment. She said the attack was a “serious blow to critical infrastructure”, describing how the perpetrators had set fire to a bridge carrying high-voltage cables and had probably used public maps to select their location.“You can find a lot of information on the internet,” Giffey admitted in an interview with the broadcaster DLF, saying policymakers needed to prioritise security over transparency in future.View image in fullscreenThe city’s mayor, Kai Wegner, visited a sports hall housing residents on army camp beds.Photograph: Axel Schmidt/ReutersManuel Atug, a founder of AG Kritis, an independent working group of experts on critical infrastructure, said his organisation had repeatedly warned of shortfalls in the system, of a lack of planning to ensure that networks – be they electricity, water or cyber – were backed up so that they could not fail due to one event such as an arson attack. Glaring also is the failure of lawmakers to put pressure on utility companies and network operators.“Resilience costs money,” Atug said. “Companies only do what they’re legally required to do.” Politicians were keener to do things that were visibly striking, such as “building drone defence centres”, rather than implementing more mundane measures such as protecting energy networks or fixingdilapidated bridgesor school buildings, he told Der Spiegel.The far-right populist Alternative für Deutschland has been keen to exploit the situation, accusing the country’s leadership of failing to keep its citizens warm and safe, and turning out this week to give away blankets. In a statement, the party’s deputy federal spokesperson, Kay Gottschalk, said the government had failed to develop “any sort of consistent political and security-related response” to sabotage or arson attacks. “It’s no longer an abstract warning we face, but a bitter reality,” he said.View image in fullscreenCamp beds set up at an emergency dormitory in Zehlendorf town hall.Photograph: Lisi Niesner/ReutersAcross Berlin there has been an outpouring of goodwill towards those who lost power.

But Silke gave this short shrift, saying: “Tell that to the elderly who were stuck in their lifts when the black out happened, or our neighbour whose cat ran away and has yet to return.”The Peters hope to be able to return to their flat on Wednesday. When they do, Silke will be in on a secret her husband had kept.“It turns out he’d been doing his own prepping,” she said, referring to supplies of tinned fish and a large canister of drinking water he had put in the cellar, unbeknown to her. “Everyone in Germany is doing it these days.

Thoughincreasing in size, they have not yet reached the size of previous movements such as the 2022 Mahsa Amini protests, which saw popular anger erupt after the 22-year-old woman died in police custody.‘We want the mullahs gone’: economic crisis sparks biggest protests in Iran since 2022Read moreInitially sparked by economic conditions and led at first by traders, the demonstrationshave since expandedto address grievances of the public towards the government, particularly as its crackdown intensifies. Videos showed students at Kermanshah University calling for the return of Reza Pahlavi, the exiled son of the former shah of Iran, while other videos showed protesters resisting teargas shot by authorities to disperse them.Seven Iranian Kurdish opposition parties called for a general strike on Thursday, while Pahlavi also called for unified protests across the country on the same day.“[The strike] will send an important signal to the entire country: that the resistance in Kurdistan is standing strong and that people are ready to continue. This is a peaceful action, and we sincerely hope that people will not be attacked,” said Hiwa Bahrami, the head of foreign relations for the Democratic party of Iranian Kurdistan.View image in fullscreenVideo footage shows protesters in the Malekshahi district of western Iran’s Ilam province on Saturday.Photograph: UGC/AFP/Getty ImagesTwo separate protesters from Kermanshah told the Guardian they had witnessed security forces shooting at protesters. The eyewitness testimony was confirmed by the Norway-basedHengaworganisation for human rights, which said it had documented the use of Kalashnikov rifles against protesters on Wednesday.At least 36 people, including four children and two members of Iran’s security forces,have been killedin the violence surrounding protests, according to the US-basedHuman Rights Activists news agency(Hrana). More than 2,100 people have been arrested so far, according to the agency, with a spate of detentions of Kurdish protesters on Wednesday.Iran’s government has thus far taken a carrot-and-stick approach to the protests, with public servants offering dialogueand economic reformwhile security forces have struck a more defiant tone.View image in fullscreenFootage appears to show Iranian security forces using teargas to disperse demonstrators in Tehran.Photograph: UGC/AFP/Getty ImagesIran’s president, Masoud Pezeshkian, has ordered investigations into videos which show riot-gear clad security forces raiding a hospital in Ilam, and his government announced the doubling of a state subsidy for breadwinners across the country. The new subsidy, which would provide £5.20 a month, is meant to ease the soaring price of basic goods such as food and medicine.At the same time, the head of Iran’s army warned the military would not sit idly by as international powers threatened to strike Iran in aid of protesters, and would take pre-emptive action. The US president, Donald Trump, hadsaid last weekthat the US would come to the rescue of protesters if Iran’s government shot and killed them – a threat that has grown more alarming for Iran since the US capture of the Venezuelan president, Nicolás Maduro, on Saturday.“The Islamic Republic considers the intensification of such rhetoric against the Iranian nation as a threat and will not leave its continuation without a response,” said Maj Gen Amir Hatami, according to Iranian state media. He said while protests were normal, the transformation of demonstrations into riots was “undoubtedly planned by the enemies”.As demonstrations continue, the economic conditions which initially triggered them worsen. The nation’s currency is depreciating, and traders have warned the price of basic goods would soar after the government announced it would cancel a programme which allowed importers and producers to use a preferential exchange rate for certain goods.View image in fullscreenProtests continued well into the night in Isfahan on 1 January.Photograph: X/IranProtestsComThe people of Iran have suffered for years due to economic mismanagement and some of the world’s harshest sanctions being placed on the country. Iran’s currency has lost two-thirds of its value in the last three years while the prices of basic goods have continued to increase. The average price of food had increased by 72% over the last year.The government has acknowledged the population’s economic woe, but has said further belt-tightening would be necessary, blaming the crisis on external factors. The vice-president, Mohammad Jafar Ghaempanah, said on Wednesday that Iran was in a “full-fledged economic war”, calling for the elimination of corruption and price-gouging within the country.Despite the escalating violence, protesters said they intended to stay on the streets and respond to the calls for protests tomorrow. Families of demonstrators killed during the 2022 protests said they had been instructed by the intelligence services not to join protests tomorrow.“They are shooting at anyone and everyone. We are united with the rest of the people across [Iran]. They stood by us in 2022 and will stand by them this time. Tomorrow is the day all the Kurdish people will be on the streets,” said Soran, from Kermanshah, speaking under a pseudonym.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

His supporters said his mood was to fight it out although he knew it was likely there would be an attempt to kill him.The UN-recognised government of national unity that supports the retention of a unified Yemen has accused him of high treason for unilaterally raising the flag of independence for southern Yemen. A former military leader turned politician, he was sacked from the government’s presidential leadership council as a result.Al-Zubaidi’s refusal to travel to Riyadh on Tuesday night, defying a demand from the Saudi defence minister, Prince Khalid bin Salman, promptedSaudi Arabiato launch airstrikes on his remaining military camps in his stronghold in the Zubaid area of Dhale region.One of al-Zubaidi’s advisers, Amr Al-Bidah, told a briefing: “Al-Zubaidi is on the ground in Aden conducting his duties,” saying there would be chaos if Saudi-backed forces tried to capture the city as was being threatened.Al-Bidah said: “Al-Zubaidi was told: ‘Either you come to Riyadh or we bomb you, and that is your last chance.’ That does not create a conducive atmosphere for dialogue.” Al-Zubaidi’s village is being bombed by the Saudis and so far about 14 civilians have been injured and two killed.There had also been concerns that if al-Zubaidi travelled to Riyadh, he would be arrested. A 50-strong STC delegation that did fly to Riyadh for talks had not been contactable, al-Bidah said, explaining: “They arrived at 3am and observers told us that they took them to a black bus. Their phones are ringing but no one is picking up. It is very worrying.”Tensions between Saudis and Emiratis over future of Yemen reach boiling pointRead moreView image in fullscreenMembers of the Southern Giants Brigade or al-Amaliqa, a pro-government militia, deployed in Aden on Monday.Photograph: Saleh al-Obeidi/AFP/Getty ImagesYemen’s deputy foreign minister, Awsan al-Aud, said: “Through its rebellion, the STC has become a banned entity. The ongoing battle will not last long. The STC has to be dismantled, or at the very least, it will have to give up arms and become a political organisation only.”Al-Zubaidi’s unilateral attempt to unfurl the flag of independence for southern Yemen started to collapse once his external backers theUnited Arab Emiratesdeserted him after it became clear that Saudi Arabia was willing to use force not just against the STC to prevent Yemen’s fragmentation, but also against UAE arms supplies reaching Yemen through the port city of Mukalla.After carefully extending his base beyond Aden over the past three years, al-Zubaidi in early December took the unilateral step of sending tens of thousands of well-equipped troops into the eastern governorates of oil-rich Hadramaut and al-Mahrah, bordering Oman. With Saudi Arabia hesitating militarily, and the UAE backing the STC, large-scale pro-independence demonstrations were held in the capital of Hadramaut.Codenamed Operation Promising Future, the campaign’s swift territorial gains – and the apparent popular support – meant that by 9 December the STC had taken control of most areas spanning the six governorates of the former southern Yemen.The turning point came when on 30 December, the royal Saudi air force carried out airstrikes on the STC-controlled Mukalla, targeting what it said was a shipment of weapons that had arrived from the UAE. Abu Dhabi denied that the shipments contained weapons, but the UN-recognised Yemeni government ordered all UAE forces to leave Yemeni territory within 24 hours, announcing a 72-hour air, land, and sea blockade, and declared a 90-day state of emergency.View image in fullscreenPro-government fighters ride on a pick-up truck in the city of Mukalla on Sunday, as the government said it had retaken control of the key eastern port and capital of Hadramaut province from the STC.Photograph: ReutersSaudi Arabia also assembled a large Gulf diplomatic alliance to oppose the splitting of Yemen, saying such a split would weaken the fight against the Houthis in northern Yemen. Later that day, the UAE announced it would voluntarily withdraw its remaining counter-terrorist forces from Yemen, but in reality it also removed much of the command and control structure it had been providing to the STC, hobbling the council’s operation.The withdrawal has resulted in the Saudi-backed forces regaining Hadramaut and al-Mahrah. At the weekend a previously STC-oriented Shabwah governorate returned to the STC fold, signalling the full-scale collapse of the revolt. Late last week the UAE in effect advised the STC it was on its own in future, ending more than six years of cooperation.In his letter to al-Zubaidi summoning him to visit, Prince Khaled said he wanted to “hear directly from you, ‘What happened?’ and what are the justifications for what occurred?”It adds: “You and the Prince must reconcile, meet, and engage in a serious, brotherly discussion so that he clearly understands the justifications for your military operation and your position in Hadramaut and al-Mahra, and this matter is closed.“The Prince will discuss with you the Transitional Council’s needs in full, including its forces, operational mechanisms, and communication channels. The Kingdom has assumed responsibility for this file following the UAE’s withdrawal.“The Prince will discuss with you future coordination and cooperation, both at the southern level and regarding the overall solution and the Yemeni situation. Any delay or failure to respond to the invitation to come to Riyadh, or any procrastination in doing so, will have serious consequences.”View image in fullscreenDaily life resumes in Mukalla after the pro-government forces took control of the city from the separatists.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesThe UAE has been backing the separatist STC since its formation in 2017 partly because it was seen as a bulwark against Muslim Brotherhood and Salifist forces inside Yemen, but also because the STC was seen as a route for Abu Dhabi to control Red Sea ports. The STC under UAE influence had also shown a willingness to cooperate with Israel. Saudi Arabia, which shares a border with Yemen, opposes Yemen’s fragmentation, believing it will weaken the fight against the Houthis that control the north of Yemen.The UAE, finding itself isolated over Yemen, is now likely to review its strategy elsewhere in the region including in Sudan where it has been backing a different faction to Riyadh.Reuters and Agence France-Presse have contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsYemenSaudi ArabiaUnited Arab EmiratesMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

In astatement, the agency said it had carried out searches at Singh’s home and Satat Sampada properties “as part of an ongoing investigation into suspicious foreign inward remittances received in the garb of consultancy charges” from climate campaign groups, “which have in turn received huge funds from prior reference category NGOs like Rockefeller Philanthropy Advisors”.“However, cross-verification of filings made by the remitters abroad indicates that the funds were actually intended to promote the agenda of the fossil fuel non-proliferation treaty within India,” the agency said.‘A shift no country can ignore’: where global emissions stand, 10 years after the Paris climate agreementRead moreThe FFNPT Initiative is an international campaign calling for a treaty to stop exploration for new fossil fuels and to gradually phase out their use. First endorsed by the Pacific Island nations of Vanuatu and Tuvalu, it has the support of 17 national governments, the World Health Organization and the European parliament, as well as a constellation of civil society figures.The ED officers said: “While presented as a climate initiative, its adoption could expose India to legal challenges in international forums like the international court of justice (ICJ) and severely compromise the nation’s energy security and economic development.”They said that in the course of their search they found a large cache of whiskey, above legal limits, at Singh’s home in Delhi and they told local police, who subsequently arrested and then bailed him on Monday night.The agency said it was investigating trips Singh made to Pakistan and Bangladesh last year, including how they were funded.Singh and Aswati said in a statement that they were prevented from sharing details of the case for legal reasons, but added: “We categorically state that the allegations being reported are baseless, biased and misleading.”Singh is a familiar figure at Cop climate negotiations, having worked for more than two decades with international NGOs and climate campaigns including ActionAid and the Climate Action Network.Civil society organisations in India under Narendra Modi have faced severe pressures. Almost 17,000 licences to receive foreign funding have been suspended and a large number of civil society organisations have shut down.According to an unnamed ED officer quoted by theHindustan Times, the investigation into Singh began on the basis of intelligence received from Cop30, held in Belém, Brazil, last November. Other activists “whose climate campaigns may be inimical to India’s energy security” were also being investigated, another unnamed officer was quoted as saying.‘It’s hell for us here’: Mumbai families suffer as datacentres keep the city hooked on coalRead moreThe ED accused Singh of running Satat Sampada as a front, publicly projecting itself as a company marketing organic produce while its “primary activity appears to be channelling foreign funds to run narratives furthering the FFNPT cause in India, on behalf of foreign influencer groups”.The agency said the company had been running at a loss until 2021 when payments from campaign groups, registered as “consultancy services” and “agro-product sales”, turned its fortunes around.“The ED suspects misdeclaration and misrepresentation of the nature and purpose of the foreign funds received by SSPL. The agency is investigating the full extent of the suspected violations … and whether the activities funded were against the national interest, specifically India’s energy security,” it said.Singh and Aswati said they started Satat Sampada with their own savings and loans secured on their home in 2016, and that the organisation’s consultancy and management services grew in 2021 after Singh left his full-time employment to focus more on its work.“His work and contributions are well documented across print, digital, television and social media, as well as public platforms,” they said.Explore more on these topicsIndiaSouth and central AsianewsShareReuse this content"

The average duration of weight loss treatment being 39 weeks while the average follow up period was 32 weeks.On average, weight was regained at a rate of 0.4kg per month for people who had stopped taking the medication, the analysis found, with participants returning to their original weight within an average of 1.7 years after stopping any type of weight loss medication.UK medical regulator warns against buying weight-loss jabs from social media channelsRead moreSpecifically, people on any kind of weight loss medication lost an average of 8.3kg during treatment, but regained 4.8kg within the first year,The rate at which weight was regained after stopping these medications was almost four times faster compared with behavioural programmes, which may include a specific diet or physical activity plan, regardless of the amount of weight that was lost during treatment.Dr Sam West, of the Nuffield Department of Primary Care Health Sciences at theUniversity of Oxford, said the rapid weight gain seen after stopping weight loss drugs was not due to the medication itself.“These medicines are transforming obesity treatment and can achieve important weight loss. However, our research shows that people tend to regain weight rapidly after stopping – faster than we see with behavioural programmes,” West said.He added: “This isn’t a failing of the medicines – it reflects the nature of obesity as a chronic, relapsing condition. It sounds a cautionary note for short-term use without a more comprehensive approach to long-term weight management, and highlights the importance of primary prevention.”Previous studies have suggested weight loss medication can also have a beneficial impact on other areas of a patient’s health, as seen in the study intodrugs that could halve heart patients’ risk of an early death.However, this study also found that the benefits weight loss drugs can have on cardio-metabolic health markers, such as on blood pressure and cholesterol, also returned to their original level within 1.4 years of stopping treatment.Although previous studies have suggested people onweight loss drugs regain all the weight they have lost within a yearof stopping medication, this is the first study which provides the rate of weight regain and estimated time frames for weight and metabolic reversal.Wegovy can be prescribed on theNHSfor up to two years, while there is no prescription time limit for Mounjaro.“Weight loss drugs can be effective tools for managing weight and type 2 diabetes risk – but this research reinforces that they are not a quick fix, according to Dr Faye Riley, the research communications lead at Diabetes UK.“They need to be prescribed appropriately, with tailored wraparound support alongside them, to ensure people can fully benefit and maintain weight loss for as long as possible when they stop taking the medication.”Katharine Jenner, the executive director of theObesityHealth Alliance, said regaining weight after stopping treatment was not a failure of individuals, but rather “reflects the reality of living in a food environment that continually pushes people towards unhealthy options.”“These drugs can create a window of opportunity to improve the food environment at scale and pace – from junk food marketing to the affordability and availability of healthier food – otherwise many people will struggle to sustain the health benefits of weight loss drugs over the long term,” Jenner said.An NHS spokesperson said: “While these new treatments are an important new tool for supporting weight loss, they’re not a magic fix and must be paired with behavioural and lifestyle wraparound support including advice on healthier diets and physical activity to keep the weight off in the long term.“The NHS continues to implement innovative ways to support people to lose weight safely and sustainably as well as offering a range of weight management services, including the NHS digital weight management programme, which will be expanded to 125,000 more people per year as part of the 10-year health plan.”Explore more on these topicsHealthWeight-loss drugsMedical researchObesityNHSUniversity of OxfordnewsShareReuse this content"

Only those we shared this time with could understand how this went on for so long.“Neither us nor Josh’s brother can imagine life without him, and as we adjust to this new world and only just begin our journey with grief, we ask that our privacy is respected.”The force has referred itself to the Independent Office for Police Conduct over its identification process.Johnson’s family added: “Whilst he was 18 and exploring his independence, he was ever so genuine in his care for others – us, his brother, his grandparents, his extended family, and his many friends.“Many of our happiest family memories were made whilst stock car racing. As new parents, we took Josh to his first stock car meeting at just six weeks old and he’s had a passion for this ever since.”Police previously said an 18-year-old was arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving and a 19-year-old was held on suspicion of perverting the course of justice.Both have been bailed pending further inquiries.Explore more on these topicsUK newsEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

He said he was concerned it would “benefit huge numbers of foreign-born people”.Reeves said those comments were akin to saying some families deserved to have children in poverty. “I don’t really care what colour a kid’s skin is – some deserve to be in poverty and some don’t? That makes me pretty angry,” she said.“DoesNigel Faragewant to go around and say: ‘White? Yeah, you can have the money. Black? No, I’m sorry, it’s not for you.’ What sort of country does he think we are?“If you’re the mum next door who works in the NHS, has lived here all her life, her kids lived here all their life, but she was born somewhere else – we’re saying that that family deserves to grow up in poverty whereas the one next door doesn’t? That’s not the sort of country I believe in.”Keir Starmer will champion the lifting of the cap on a visit to Bedfordshire on Thursday, saying Reform and the Conservatives’ opposition to the change “exposes the deep division and decline” of their agendas.“Nigel Farage seems intent on linking arms with the Conservatives in a cruel alliance to push kids who need help back into poverty. This child poverty pact is something that should worry us all. These aren’t numbers on a spreadsheet – these are children’s life chances at stake,” the prime minister will say.Analysis byLabouron Farage’s proposal to only give additional benefits to households with two working parents born in the UK suggests the policy would help just 3,700 – less than 1% of those affected by the two-child limit.View image in fullscreenOn Wednesday, Nigel Farage again shifted his denial of allegations of racist and antisemitic bullying during his time at Dulwich college.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesIn the same press conference on Wednesday, Farage again shifted his denial of allegations of racist and antisemitic bullying during his time at Dulwich college.He previously said he did not recognise the events described by more than 30 people who have spoken to the Guardian, or that he would never deliberately abuse someone “in a hurtful or insulting way”. But on Wednesday Farage said: “Some of what is out there is just absolute nonsense made by people with very obvious, if you look, political motivation.”Amid boos from Reform members directed at the ITV journalist who asked why he had not apologised to his accusers, Farage said: “I don’t apologise for things that are complete made-up fantasies.”Reeves said there would now be a big battle to win over public opinion to back the measure that could lift 550,000 children out of poverty – and that Reform and the Conservatives would press to undo the change.“I think we did it in the right way, but when we announced it this year, we’re not hanging around, it comes in in April,” she said, speaking after a reception for child poverty campaigners who urged her to be more vocal in defending the policy to win over sceptics.“We’ve both managed to return stability but also deliver on our values of reducing child poverty and increasing social justice. It’s not good enough just to win the argument with the government and with the Labour party, we’ve got to make sure that no party ever feels that they can get away with reversing this policy. And that comes from public consent. And also, frankly, it comes from not electing the Tories or Reform.”Reeves said Labour would not shy away from using the measure as a way to win back progressive voters angered by aspects of the government’s agenda.“When people say, oh, there’s no difference, and what’s the point of voting Labour – there’s 550,000 kids at the end of this parliament [who] are going to be growing up in a house without mould, where the mum and the kids are going be able to afford to eat and not go to school or work hungry. If anyone thinks that that is not worth voting for then I don’t know what is, because this is everything.”Farage, asked how he would vote on the bill to lift the cap, told a press conference his comments about supporting an end to the cap had been misinterpreted.“I was trying to be pro-family, pro-children, pro-working people who find it very, very hard to pay for childcare. It’s a disincentive for them to have children and to go to work at the same time,” he said. “I think the way this government is doing it … looking at some of the stats, it’s going to start to benefit huge numbers of foreign-born people. And that goes back to this point.“We have to prioritise British-born people, whether it’s for child benefit or whether it’s for social housing. And so I think when it comes, we will vote against it.”Explore more on these topicsRachel ReevesNigel FarageLabourReform UKChild benefitsnewsShareReuse this content"

The common agricultural policy payments and their successors have often been what has kept farms profitable during inflationary pressures and extreme weather events such as floods and droughts.The money for the SFI is limited, meaning that when enough applications for it come in, the scheme is closed. Farmerswere outragedwhen the scheme was abruptly shut in March last year and it later emerged that 3,000 farms had been wrongly blocked from applying after themoney ran out.Reynolds is expected to say in her speech: “Farmers are at the heart of our national life – for what you produce, the communities you sustain, and the landscapes and heritage you protect.“We will work with you – through our new Farming and Food Partnership Board, through peer-to-peer networks, through community-led change, and through engagement on the detailed changes to SFI.“You will have the certainty you need to plan – clear budgets, clear timelines, clear future roadmap, and growth built on strong foundations.”Defra has been making the case to the Treasury that the nature schemes are good value for money, and not subsidising rich landowners, in order to keep the budget untouched during difficult economic times. During the spending review last year, the budget wasslashed by £100m.The Guardianrevealed last yearthat ministers were looking at how the dwindling funding pot could be reserved for those farms which are less profitable, with plans to cut richer farms from the scheme.The Country Land and Business Association president, Gavin Lane, said: “It is essential that all farmers can access the Sustainable Farming Incentive scheme as soon as possible, regardless of farm type or size, to deliver the greatest benefits to the environment.”Martin Lines, the chief executive of the Nature Friendly Farming Network, said: “It’s good to finally have some clarity, even if June still feels a long way off. We particularly welcome the commitment to prioritise smaller farms. Too often in the past, England’s agri-environment schemes have been a race to be first over the line, favouring those with the time and money to navigate complex applications. Many smaller, highly active farms are working flat out and simply don’t have the capacity to play that game.“We’ve long advocated for a reward system that properly reflects the real public value delivered by smaller production systems. It’s encouraging to see government recognising the role of small farms in supporting social cohesion, keeping people on the land, and ensuring public money for public goods genuinely rewards those systems.”Explore more on these topicsFarmingnewsShareReuse this content"

It is a machine designed to protect the people at the top and the friends they exchange favors with while the rest of us drown in toxic smoke and ash,” Pratt said at the They Let Us Burn rally.Pratt and his wife, fellow reality television personality Heidi Montag, lost their home in last year’s fire, as did his parents. He has accused officials of a bevy of shortcomings, including decades of poor vegetation management by the state, and the deficiencies of the fire department and its leadership.“It could be due to lack of budget, lack of knowledge or simply DEI,” Pratt said of the fire department.Although Pratt’scampaign websiteis live, it remains bare, and features links to his social media, a button for donations and a headshot captioned Pacific Palisades Resident & Karen Bass’ Worst Nightmare. Pratt has also updated his Instagram bio to say the account will now be used for his campaign.Pratt joins a crowded field that includes Bass; Austin Beutner, the former superintendent of the LA unified school district; community organizer Rae Huang; and potentially Rick Caruso, the wealthy businessman who unsuccessfully ran against Bass for the mayoral seat in 2022.Caruso has not yet announced whether he will run again in the June primary. He is reportedly also weighing a run forCaliforniagovernor.Pratt has already received an endorsement from Ric Grenell, a Republican former diplomat and current interim head of the Kennedy Center, who also runs Fix California, a group that seeks to bring more conservative lawmakers into state government.“Transparency is what we need.

Sure looks like ICE just killed that woman,” she said.On MS NOW, former chief of the US Capitol police Tom Manger also criticized the remarks by Frey, the Minneapolis mayor. “When elected officials get out in front of an investigation and give you their conclusions, I don’t know how helpful that is,” he said.While video spread quickly across social media, CNN said it would need to verify it before being able to show it. “I want to warn viewers that this video is hard to watch,” CNN anchor Jake Tapper said.On MS NOW, Nicolle Wallace aired one of the most widely shared videos, cautioning viewers that it is “really disturbing” but said it was “really important” for people to see.Shock and outrage at scene of Minneapolis ICE shooting: ‘This is just sad’Read moreExplore more on these topicsMinneapolisTV newsCNNFox NewsMSNBCUS televisionNewspapers & magazinesnewsShareReuse this content"

Trump – who calls climate change a hoax – withdrew from that agreement soon after reclaiming the White House.Mainstream scientists say the climate crisis is behind increasing instances of deadly and costly extreme weather, including flooding, droughts, wildfires, intense rainfall events and dangerous heat.The US withdrawal could hinder global efforts to curb greenhouse gases because it “gives other nations the excuse to delay their own actions and commitments,” said Stanford University climate scientist Rob Jackson, who chairs the Global Carbon Project, a group of scientists that tracks countries’ carbon dioxide emissions.It also will be difficult to achieve meaningful progress on the climate crisis without cooperation from the US, one of the world’s largest emitters and economies, experts said.The UN’s population agency, which provides sexual and reproductive health across the world, has long been a lightning rod for Republican opposition and Trump himself cut funding for the agency during his first term in office. He and other GOP officials have accused the agency of participating in “coercive abortion practices” in countries like China.When Joe Biden took office in January 2021, he restored funding for the agency. A state department review conducted the following year found no evidence to support these claims.Other organizations and agencies that the US will quit include the Carbon Free Energy Compact, the United Nations University, the International Cotton Advisory Committee, the International Tropical Timber Organization, the Partnership for Atlantic Cooperation, the Pan-American Institute for Geography and History, the International Federation of Arts Councils and Culture Agencies and the International Lead and Zinc Study Group.The state department said additional reviews are ongoing.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpTrump administrationUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Heller said she saw a car blocking traffic that appeared to be part of a protest against the ICE operation, and heard an agent telling the driver, a woman, to “get out of here”.Shock and outrage at scene of Minneapolis ICE shooting: ‘This is just sad’Read more“She was trying to turn around, and the ICE agent was in front of her car, and he pulled out a gun and put it right in – like his midriff was on her bumper – and he reached across the hood of the car and shot her in the face like three, four times,” Hellertold MPR News, a Minneapolis public radio station.The woman has been identified as 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good, the Minnesota Star Tribunereported.Speaking to the outlet, Good’s mother, Donna Ganger, said her daughter had been living in the Twin Cities with her partner. She said that her daughter was “not part of anything like that at all”, referring to protesters who have challenged ICE’s presence inMinnesota.“Renee was one of the kindest people I’ve ever known … She was extremely compassionate. She’s taken care of people all her life. She was loving, forgiving and affectionate. She was an amazing human being,” Ganger told the outlet.Avideo posted onlineby the Minnesota Reformer and another video obtained by the Guardian appeared to capture the moment of the shooting as a dark red SUV drove away from agents moving toward it, although the front of the vehicle is obscured.The fatal shooting by a federal officer on Wednesday took place less than a mile fromwhere George Floyd was murderedby a Minneapolis police officer in 2020, prompting mass protests.In apost on X, the homeland security department (DHS) said the person was a “domestic terrorist” who “weaponized her vehicle” and attempted “to run over our law enforcement officers in an attempt to kill them”.The department claimed several ICE officers were hurt, but said that they were expected to make “full recoveries”.“An ICE officer, fearing for his life, the lives of his fellow law enforcement and the safety of the public, fired defensive shots. He used his training and saved his own life and that of his fellow officers,” the DHS post said.The videos appeared to contradict that statement, showing the SUV clearly backing up away from ICE officers as they approach. One ICE officer can be seen partially in front of the car as it moves forward and then away from the officers. That same ICE officer is seen firing his gun as the car appears to drive by him. Three gunshots can be heard ringing out.There is no visible sign in the videos of ICE officers being injured. The agent who appeared to have fired the fatal shots is seen returning to a silver SUV that was driven away from the scene shortly after – through a red traffic light.In a press conference, Jacob Frey, the mayor of Minneapolis, emphasized that the priority of local law enforcement was to get the victim to the hospital, and then to remove ICE from the scene because they were “making a difficult situation more problematic”.He also noted that the video footage does not appear to show that a vehicle was being weaponized against the ICE officer.Frey evenissuedan emphatic statement to ICE directly: “I do have a message for our community for our city and I do have a message for ICE. To ICE, get the fuck out of Minneapolis. We do not want you here. Your stated reason for being in this city is to create some kind of safety and you are doing exactly the opposite.“People are being hurt. Families are being ripped apart. Long-term Minneapolis residents that have contributed so greatly to our city, to our culture, to our economy are being terrorized, and now, somebody is dead.Continuing to address ICE, Frey said: “That’s on you. It’s also on you to leave. It’s on you to make sure that further damage, further loss of life and injury, is not done.”The mayor also said that DHS was “trying to spin this as an action of self-defense. Having seen the video myself, I want to tell everybody directly, that is bullshit.”The Minneapolis chief of police, Brian O’Hara, said: “This woman was in her car and it appears then blocking the street because of the presence of federal law enforcement, which is obviously something that has been happening not just in Minneapolis but around the country.”The woman was no longer in the car when he arrived on the scene, O’Hara said, adding that “a spouse” had since arrived at the hospital. The police chief said the FBI would conduct a joint investigation with the Minnesota bureau of criminal apprehension.Tim Walz, the Democratic governor whoannouncedthis week he would not run for a third term,postedon X that he had “seen the video. Don’t believe this propaganda machine. The state will ensure there is a full, fair, and expeditious investigation to ensure accountability and justice.”Walz later said he had activated the state’s emergency operations center and “issued a warning order to prepare the Minnesota national guard”.“We’ve been warning for weeks that the Trump administration’s dangerous, sensationalized operations are a threat to our public safety, that someone was going to get hurt,” Walz said.To Minnesotans, Walz said: “I feel your anger, I’m angry.” He urged residents who plan on protesting to “please do so peacefully”.Walz also said that the state did not “need any further help from the federal government”, adding: “To Donald Trump and Kristi Noem, you’ve done enough.”Omar also rejected claims made by DHS onXin a Wednesday afternoon post: “You’re lying. There was no attempt to run the officer over and no ICE agents appear to be hurt. Get out of our city.”In a statement on Truth Social, Donald Trump defended the ICE officers, saying he had watched a video clip of the incident and called it a “horrible thing to watch”.Trump called one of the witnesses a “professional agitator” and described the woman driving the car as “very disorderly, obstructing and resisting” and said she “violently, willfully, and viciously ran over the ICE Officer, who seems to have shot her in self defense”.“Based on the attached clip, it is hard to believe he is alive, but is now recovering in the hospital,” Trump said. “The situation is being studied, in its entirety, but the reason these incidents are happening is because the Radical Left is threatening, assaulting, and targeting our Law Enforcement Officers and ICE Agents on a daily basis.”Protesters gathered close to the scene in the south of the city shortly after the shooting, with law enforcement officers firing chemical irritants in an attempt to disperse them.In video footage, bystanders can been seen and heard blowing whistles and taunting the agents, telling them to go home. A womansaidshe had spoken to an eyewitness who told her the person shot was a woman who “took off” from federal agents.“They shot her through the windshield. They shot her in the face,” the woman said.Jon Collins, a reporter for MPR News, posted to Bluesky that protesters stopped ICE agents after the shooting and were pepper-sprayed.“ICE teargassed a lot of people as they drove down the alley. People were stuck in the alley and hit hard. Some people are still getting medical treatment,” hewrote.The Department of Homeland Security said on Tuesday it had launched an extraordinary immigration enforcement operation, with 2,000 agents and officers expected in the Minneapolis and St Paul area for a crackdown tied in part to allegations of fraud involving Somali residents.The Immigration Defense Network, a coalition of groups serving immigrants in Minnesota, held a training session Tuesday night for about 100 people who are willing to hit the streets to monitor the federal enforcement.Explore more on these topicsMinneapolisTrump administrationUS immigrationUS politicsICE (US Immigration and Customs Enforcement)MinnesotanewsShareReuse this content"

The Trump administration has also said it isexamining “a range of options” to acquire Greenland, and noted that using the US military to do so is “always an option”.On Truth Social, Trump wrote: “All United State Defense Contractors, and the Defense Industry as a whole, BEWARE: While we make the best Military Equipment in the World (No other Country is even close!), Defense Contractors are currently issuing massive Dividends to their Shareholders and massive Stock Buybacks, at the expense and detriment of investing in Plants and Equipment. This situation will no longer be allowed or tolerated!“Executive Pay Packages in the Defense Industry are exorbitant and unjustifiable given how slowly these Companies are delivering vital Equipment to our Military, and our Allies,” he added. “Salaries, Stock Options, and every other form of Compensation are far too high for these Executives.”In fiscal year 2024, the CEOs of Lockheed Martin andGeneral Dynamicsreceivedmore than $23.7meach in total compensation, the RTX CEO receivedmore than $18m, and the Northrop Grumman CEO receivedmore than $24.3m.General Dynamics declined to comment. Lockheed Martin, RTX and Northrop Grumman did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Trump has pushed military defense spending to nearly $1tn annually, signing abilllast month authorizing a record $901bn. But on Wednesday, he raised the prospect of increasing the overall budget to $1.5tn by 2027.“This will allow us to build the ‘Dream Military’ that we have long been entitled to and, more importantly, that will keep us SAFE and SECURE, regardless of foe,” Trump claimed.Less than two hours earlier, he had ordered the US defense sector to curb its payments to executives and shareholders.“I will not permit Dividends or Stock Buybacks for Defense Companies until such time as these problems are rectified – Likewise, for Salaries and Executive Compensation,” said Trump, without providing a legislative plan. “MILITARY EQUIPMENT IS NOT BEING MADE FAST ENOUGH! It must be built now with the Dividends, Stock Buybacks, and Over Compensation of Executives, rather than borrowing from Financial Institutions, or getting the money from your Government.”Trump has been told by officials that Raytheon, owned by RTX, has been “the least responsive to the needs” of the Pentagon, “the slowest in increasing their volume, and the most aggressive spending on their Shareholders rather than the needs and demands of the United States Military”, he said.“Either Raytheon steps up, and starts investing in more upfront Investment like Plants and Equipment, or they will no longer be doing business with Department of War,” Trump wrote. “Also, if Raytheon wants further business with the United States Government, under no circumstances will they be allowed to do any additional Stock Buybacks, where they have spent Tens of Billions of Dollars, until they are able to get their act together.

The US energy secretary, Chris Wright, said the US would take payment for the oil and use the proceeds “to benefit the Venezuelan people”.Trump claims Venezuela is set for an oil boom after US attack – history points to a bumpy road aheadRead more“We’re going to market the crude coming out of Venezuela,” Wright said. “First this backed-up store of oil, and then indefinitely going forward we will sell the production that comes out of Venezuela in the marketplace.”Wright set out the plans for long-term control of Venezuela’s oil industry as the US seized a Russian-flagged oil tanker that had been on course to travel to Venezuela from Iran before it turned back towards the Atlantic.The vessel, the Marinera,previously known as the Bella 1, is understood to be part of ashadow fleetmoving oil for Russia, Iran and Venezuela, and the high-stakes operation is likely to risk confrontation with the Kremlin after Moscow reportedly dispatched a submarine to safeguard the vessel.A second tanker, the Sophia, was later seized in the Caribbean. The US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, said Venezuela’s interim leaders had asked for the oil cargo seized on the ship to be “part of this deal”.“They want the oil that was seized on one of those ships to be part of the deal. They understand that the only way they can move oil and generate revenue and not have economic collapse is if they work with the United States,” he said.Late on Wednesday, the US vice president, JD Vance, told Fox News’ Jesse Watters Primetime show that Venezuela could only sell its oil if it served US interests.He said: “We control the energy resources, and we tell the regime you’re allowed to sell the oil so long as you serve America’s national interest, you’re not allowed to sell it if you can’t serve America’s national interest.”A continuing supply of crude from Venezuela could act as a drag on oil prices, which last year recorded theirsteepest annual fallsince the Covid pandemic and could plummet further as oil producers continue to pump more than is needed by the global economy.Global oil prices fell on Wednesday, although they recovered some ground in morning trading in New York. The international benchmark, Brent crude, fell to just over $60 a barrel on Wednesday, while the US oil price was down by 0.5%, at $60.39 a barrel, after falling below $56 earlier.The oil grab also raises the prospect of disruption to Venezuela’s oil exports to China, which takes about 80% of its crude exports, potentially forcing Beijing to pay higher prices for its crude and increasing tensions with the White House.China’s foreign ministry said on Wednesday that Venezuela “enjoys full and permanent sovereignty over its natural resources and economic activities”, and US demands for the country to hand over its oil “violate international law, infringe upon Venezuela’s sovereignty, and harm the rights of the Venezuelan people”.In a post on his Truth Social platform late on Tuesday,Donald Trumpsaid: “That money will be controlled by me, as President … It will be taken by storage ships, and brought directly to unloading docks in the United States.”Oil graphicTrump has said he wants Venezuela’s interim president, Delcy Rodríguez, to give the US and private companies “total access” to Venezuela’s oil industry. He said Wright was in charge of executing the deal, adding that the oil would be taken from ships and sent directly to US ports.Wright told a Goldman Sachs energy conference in Miami on Wednesday: “If we control the flow of oil and the flow of the cash that comes from those sales, we have large leverage. We need … control of those oil sales to drive the changes that simply must happen.”The state oil company Petróleos de Venezuela SA (PDVSA), which under a decree issued during Hugo Chávez’s presidency holds at least a 51% stake and operational control over all exploration fields, released a statement saying it was “moving forward with negotiations for the sale of crude volumes to the US”.In the statement, shared across the regime’s official Telegram channels, PDVSA said the “process is being carried out under schemes similar to those in place with international companies such as Chevron”. Even before last Saturday’s strike, the US company already held about 25% of operations in Venezuela, with PDVSA controlling 50%, about 20% split between joint ventures with China and Russia, and 5% held by European companies.PDVSA said the talks with the US were “based on a strictly commercial transaction, guided by criteria of legality, transparency and mutual benefit”, and it reiterated “its commitment to building partnerships that drive national development in favour of the Venezuelan people and contribute to global energy stability”.After Saturday morning’s attack on Caracas led to thecapture of Nicolás Maduro, Trump vowed that US companies wouldreignite Venezuela’s struggling oil industry.US oil executives from Chevron, ConocoPhillips and ExxonMobil are expected to meet Trump at the White House on Friday to discuss plans to pour billions of dollars into the industry in Venezuela.Chevron is the only US oil company that still operates in the country, after the assets of ConocoPhillips and Exxon were nationalised by the former president Hugo Chávez in the mid-2000s, a move Trump has described as “the greatest theft in the history of America”.The US oil majors have so fardeclined to outline publiclyany such plans for investment and there is scepticism that big listed companies would be willing to invest in a politically unstable region amid falling global oil prices without iron-clad guarantees that their investments would be protected.There is also scepticism over whether Venezuela, which holds the world’s largest reserves of crude, could once again produce meaningful amounts after years of neglect and corruption that caused its output to fall from highs of 3.5m barrels of oil a day 25 years ago to about 1m bpd – or less than 1% of the global market.The multibillion-dollar investment needed to increase Venezuela’s oil production to the levels of its heyday in the late 1990s could require 15 years of work to repair the country’s degraded infrastructure and capital spending of up to $185bn, according to analysis by Rystad Energy, a global consultancy.The US Department of State was approached for comment.Explore more on these topicsOilDonald TrumpVenezuelaAmericasCommoditiesTrump administrationOil and gas companiesnewsShareReuse this content"

Paramount said this could tackle WBD’s “amorphous need” for financial flexibility.Paramount is fighting to unravel the$82.7bn deal WBD has agreed with Netflix, through which the streaming service is aiming to acquire WBD’s storied movie studios, HBO cable network and HBO Max streaming service.UnlikeNetflix, Paramount has bid for the entire company – which also includes CNN, the Cartoon Network and the Discovery Channel. But WBD’s board has said its bid was “inadequate”, with “significant” risks and costs.In a letter to shareholders on Wednesday, it said: “Your board unanimously determined that the amended offer remains inadequate particularly given the insufficient value it would provide, the lack of certainty in Paramount Skydance’s ability to complete the offer, and the risks and costs borne by WBD shareholders should Paramount Skydance fail to complete the offer.”In a filing accompanying the letter, WBD called the hostile bid, even with the new Ellison backstop, the “largest LBO [leveraged buyout] in history”, a structure it said poses risks to the offer.Under the terms of its deal with Netflix, WBD would have to pay a $2.8bn breakup fee if it walked away from the agreement.Paramount Skydance’s revised offer alsoinvolved increasing its termination fee to $5.8bn, matching Netflix.However, WBD said if it were to accept the deal with Paramount it would incur $4.7bn in costs, including the breakup fee to Netflix, additional interest on debt and a $1.5bn fee for failing to complete a debt exchange.The Netflix deal for the Warner Bros studios, HBO and HBO Max, and Paramount’s approach for all of WBD, are widely expectedly to face strong regulatory scrutiny. Prominent lawmakers and entertainment industry operators have expressed concern, and Donald Trump indicated that he intends to be involved.On Wednesday, Ted Sarandos and Greg Peters, co-chief executives of Netflix, said WBD recognises its offer as the “superior proposal”.The company also said it had submitted a mandatory pre-merger notification with regulators and was engaging with competition authorities, including the US Department of Justice and the European Commission.Paramount Skydance has yet to comment on the rejection of its latest offer. The company must now decide whether to continue with its hostile bid and take its offer directly to WBD shareholders, or raise its $30 per share bid and respond to the criticisms made by WBD’s board.However, the company has previously said its latest offer is not its “best and final” proposal.WBD’s share price was roughly flat in early trading after the widely expected rebuffal. However, the bidding battle to take over the group has pushed its share price up by almost 170% over the past year.Sarandos and Peters said: “The WBD board remains fully supportive of and continues to recommend Netflix’s merger agreement, recognising it as the superior proposal that will deliver the greatest value to its stockholders, as well as consumers, creators and the broader entertainment industry.”Explore more on these topicsWarner BrosTelevision industryParamount PicturesNetflixParamount+Mergers and acquisitionsCorporate governancenewsShareReuse this content"

Describing the ruling, the company said it “imposes on the Post-Gazette outdated and inflexible operational practices unsuited for today’s local journalism”.“We deeply regret the impact this decision will have on Pittsburgh and the surrounding region,” Block Communications said.The newspaper’s closure follows Block Communications’decision earlier this monthto shut down another publication, the 34-year old Pittsburgh City Paper, citing a “business model [that] has not reached a level of financial performance that allows Block Communications to continue operating it responsibly”.Explore more on these topicsPennsylvaniaUS press and publishingNewspapersNewspaper closuresNewspapers & magazinesnewsShareReuse this content"

I’m going to stop wars,”Donald Trumpsaid after declaring victory on 6 November 2024. It wasn’t his first pledge to disengage the US from foreign conflicts, and Trump’s top allies in conservative media and the “Make America Great Again” (Maga) movement have all rallied to his pledge to “put America first”.Now that the US president seems to have broken his pledge by launching an invasion of Venezuela, not to mention threatening future actions against Cuba and Colombia and potentiallyGreenland, some have reasonably wondered whether Trump’s supporters in Maga media would hammer him for that inconsistency.But in the days since the US forcibly abducted Venezuela’s president, Nicolás Maduro, and his wife, with dozens killed as part of the night-time operation, Trump has instead received strong support from his media allies, with a few on-again, off-again backers expressing some reservations.“Generally, the party is going to stand with him on this and conservative media is going to stand with him on this,” former Republican congressman and talk radio host Joe Walsh said.The conservative radio and television host Mark Levin, one of Trump’s strongest media defenders, not only celebrated Trump’s military actions but on Sunday called those who questioned the legality of the incursion, including Senator Bernie Sanders and the New York City mayor, Zohran Mamdani, “pure evil”.“They defend totalitarianism [sic] regimes against our nation’s own security and interests,”he added. Levin and Fox News host Sean Hannity have also championed “The Donroe Doctrine”, the notion that Trump’s America has dominance over the Western hemisphere.The conservative commentator Ben Shapirocalled out thoseon the “so-called isolationalist right” who may oppose the Trump administration’s actions, referring primarily to former Fox News host Tucker Carlson. Shapiro said that Maduro was ousted by “a conservative Republican president, a gutsy president, who makes the calls to preserve America’s national security and her foreign interests”.View image in fullscreenTrump and Carlson on the Tucker Carlson Live Tour in Glendale, Arizona in 2024.Photograph: Patrick T Fallon/AFP/Getty ImagesBut even Carlson expressed cautious optimism inan episode of his streaming showon Monday after Trump gave his backing to Maduro’s former vice-president, Delcy Rodríguez.Carlson said he’s “grateful for the wisdom of not taking out the entire government”, clarifying: “Not because I support the government, but because we have clear models in Iraq and Libya and a lot of Syria: it can be very hard to put those things back together again.” Carlson said it “seems like a much wiser approach” to keep the government structure in place but “making sure it’s pro-American”.“That makes me calm down a bit,” he added.The coverage among opinion hosts on Fox News has also been overwhelmingly positive. Fox News host Laura Ingraham called the capture of Maduro “quintessentially Maga”.“America and the world is a safer, freer place,” Hannity said on Monday night. “And this administration, they are making no apologies, nor should they.“Donald Trump’s like my surgeon: he’s elegant, and he’s precise, and he went in there with the perfect extraction,” Fox News host Jesse Watters said on the Five on Monday. “This is not regime change. This is just trying to change the regime’s behavior.”Not everyone is falling in line. Former Fox News host Megyn Kelly, who now runs her own company and has a radio channel on SiriusXM, mocked the pro-Trump coverage on her former network, even as she re-affirmed her support for the president. “I turned on Fox News yesterday, and I’m sorry, but it was like watching Russian propaganda,” she said on her Monday show. “There was nothing skeptical. It was all rah-rah cheerleading, yes, let’s go. And that’s fine. I love our military as much as anyone, and I believe in President Trump, but there are serious reasons to just exercise a note of caution before we just get on the rah-rah train.” She said Trump’s actions to depose Maduro were clearly about global oil dominance and not “this bullshit about law enforcement”.View image in fullscreenMegyn Kelly and Donald Trump in 2016.Photograph: FOX/FOX Image Collection/Getty ImagesKat Timpf, a libertarian commentator who is a regular panelist on Fox News host Greg Gutfeld’s late-night show, pointed out the inconsistencies in Trump’s past comments about international involvement. “Let me get this straight: we go to a country, we capture their leader, we bomb it, and then we say, ‘We run this country now.’ And that is not war,” she said, “but when they send cocaine over here that people are willingly snorting – that is war? It doesn’t make any sense … I hope I’m wrong. I hope this is suddenly the one regime change that works out well for us and for the people we are supposed to be rescuing, but we do not have a very good track record.” (Timpf said on Xthat she’s received “very brutal personal attacks” from Trump supporters – and from fellow long-term skeptics about foreign interventionism – for expressing concerns about Venezuela.)The conservative media personality Candace Owens, who has emerged as a regular critic of the president, called it a CIA-led “hostile takeover of a country at the behest of a globalist psychopaths”,she wrote in a post on X, adding that “there has never been a single regime change that Zionists have not applauded because it means they get to steal land, oil and other resources.”And Carlson, too, who had long warned against “regime change” in Venezuela, seemed skeptical that the US should be meddling in other Latin-American countries, including Cuba, where Trump seemed to show interest in intervention. “To spend all your time worrying about Cuba? I love the Cubans here. Love them. But how much money do you want to spend out of your kid’s college fund on regime change in Cuba?”On his War Room showon Saturday, Steve Bannon,who prominently opposedthe US pushing for so-called regime change in Iran this summer, called Trump’s move in Venezuela “a stunning and dazzling strike” and a “bold and brilliant raid” – thoughhe has questionedthe long-term consequences.There was also some discord in the Murdoch-controlled print media ecosystem. The New York Post’s editorial board came out strongly in defense of the raid,writing: “Operation Absolute Resolve was stunningly successful, fresh testimony to the tremendous professionalism of America’s servicemen and -women – and of course to the resolve of President Donald Trump.” The Wall Street Journal’s editorial board, however,took a more skeptical perspective, writing on Saturday that it was “odd” that Trump was “so dismissive” of the Venezuelan opposition leader, María Corina Machado. The board also dinged Trump for talking excessively about US interest in Venezuelan oil, “which sends a message that the US purpose is largely mercenary”. On Sunday, the board seemed skeptical about the possibility of Venezuela’s current leadership remaining in place. “The Trump Administration talks about its foreign-policy ‘realism’,”they wrote. “But if Maduro 2.0 remains in defiant power in six months, its gamble on his henchmen won’t look very realistic.”Walsh, a former supporter of the Tea Party movement who left the House of Representatives in 2013, knows the price of standing in opposition to Trump. Hehad his radio show cancelled by Salem Radio Networkin 2019 after he became a critic of Trump and announced a primary challenge.“To be in rightwing media, it became clear when he first won, you either get on the train, or you don’t. It’s still that way,” he said in an interview. “If 100% of the audience came out against what Trump did in Venezuela, you’d see these people move, but that’s not going to happen.”Explore more on these topicsRepublicansUS attack on VenezuelaDonald TrumpanalysisShareReuse this content"

They are typically binary bets, punting on yes/no or higher/lower outcomes.Last Friday an anonymous trader on Polymarket appeared to invest $30,000 (£22,343) on the market:Maduro out by 31 January 2026. After Maduro’s capture was announced on Saturday morning,the trader seemed to have made profits of $436,759.61.After Polymarket clarified that the seizure of Maduro did not qualify for a winning bet, the odds of an invasion before the end of January crashed to below 5%.Traders have placed more than $10.5m onbets of an invasion this year,with the majority on a 31 January deadline. The remainder have put money on contracts for the end of March and December. Some traders have bet tens of thousands of dollars on the question.Polymarket was approached for comment. On its website, the platform states that the bet refers to “US military operations intended to establish control”. It added: “President Trump’s statement that they will ‘run’Venezuelawhile referencing ongoing talks with the Venezuelan government does not alone qualify the snatch-and-extract mission to capture Maduro as an invasion.”Traders on the platform have expressed their anger at Polymarket’s position. A user named Skinner wrote: “Polymarket has descended into sheer arbitrariness. Words are redefined at will, detached from any recognised meaning, and facts are simply ignored. That a military incursion, the kidnapping of a head of state, and the takeover of a country are not classified as an invasion is plainly absurd.”Polymarket, which only last year gained regulatory approval to operate in the US, is one of the many prediction platforms that have started to gain popularity in the US. The site does not have a licence to operate in Great Britain.The president’s eldest son,Donald TrumpJr, has taken advisory roles at Polymarket, as well as its peer Kalshi.Explore more on these topicsVenezuelaNicolás MaduroGamblingAmericasDonald TrumpTrump administrationnewsShareReuse this content"

The median sale price stood at $410,800 last year, according to the US Census Bureau.“For a very long time, buying and owning a home was considered the pinnacle of the American Dream,” Trump wrote on Wednesday, describing home purchases as “the reward for working hard, and doing the right thing.“The American Dream is increasingly out of reach for far too many people, especially younger Americans,” he added, blaming his predecessor Joe Biden for “Record High Inflation”.Trump said: “It is for that reason, and much more, that I am immediately taking steps to ban large institutional investors from buying more single-family homes, and I will be calling on Congress to codify it. People live in homes, not corporations.”The president is expected to attended January’s annual meeting of the World Economic Forum, and address the talkfest in the Swiss Alps.

City endureda third consecutive drawto leave the leaders Arsenal, who have a game in hand, five points ahead and currently without a title challenger.An Erling Haaland penalty gave City a platform they were unable to build on, failing to convert a plethora of chances in the second half. City let Brighton come back into the match and deservedly depart with a point thanks to Kaoru Mitoma.Antoine Semenyo’s parting gift gives Bournemouth victory over shaky SpursRead more“I love a lot, many, many good things but we didn’t score goals,” Guardiola said. “So many clear chances [missed], and it’s not just one player, two players, it’s all the people up front who played a lot. To score goals is part of your job.”Amid a hectic schedule and with absentees aplenty, a sluggish and rhythmless City struggled to threaten a well-disciplined Brighton defence prior to the break. There was often a line of eight yellow shirts on the edge of the box, forcing City to work hard to assess the few gaps. Set pieces looked a promising route with Max Alleyne miscuing a header at the front post and Bernardo Silva firing straight at Bart Verbruggen from corners.Injuries to Rúben Dias and Josko Gvardiol forced Alleyne to cut short a loan at Watford on Monday, and he was thrust into the starting lineup for a debut alongside Abdukodir Khusanov. The centre-backs acquitted themselves well against a progressive Brighton side, offering a positive on a difficult night.Brighton tried to punish City’s back four on the counterattack. Ferdi Kadioglu went through one‑on‑one, only to be repelled by Gianluigi Donnarumma, while Georginio Rutter was stopped at the last second thanks to the speed of Khusanov, who is not much more experienced than his partner Alleyne.View image in fullscreenErling Haaland gave Manchester City the lead but wasted a good late chance to win the game.Photograph: Adam Vaughan/EPAHaaland’s penalty was a rare highlight in a first half of struggle for City. Jérémy Doku, City’s most dangerous attacking threat won it because his feet were too quick for Diego Gómez, and the striker sent Verbruggen the wrong way to collect his 150th goal for the club. The spot-kick created a brief distraction from the volatile disagreement between Guardiola and Fabian Hürzeler on the touchline, earning the former a caution for complaining that it took the referee a look at the monitor before awarding it.If the opening 45 minutes were about Brighton’s defensive mentality, that was almost forgotten seconds after the break when a confused Yasin Ayari played the ball straight to Silva eight yards out. He shimmed and sent Verbruggen the wrong way but clipped the outside of a post when doubling the lead looked more likely, initiating a long list of failed conversions. It always felt like a second was needed for City but they could only muster six shots on target from 22 attempts. “We are not pleased how we gave away the chances, I think we did too many easy mistakes; too many mistakes where we invited them to score goals,” Hürzeler said.At the other end it was too simple for Mitoma, who was allowed space on the edge of the box and a simple route to cut inside, before finding the corner from 18 yards. “We all know that he can make the difference in the game, that he can be a gamechanger,” Hürzeler said of Mitoma. “He’s still not at 100%, but we need to push him to 100%.”Fulham’s Harry Wilson piles pain on 10-man Chelsea as Liam Rosenior watches onRead moreAntoine Semenyo will be a City player by the end of the week, providing energy, physicality, skill and ability to score important goals. It will be a boost with Savinho ruled out for up to two months – another option for Guardiola, who now also has a chance to prepare long-throw routines. That variety will give City’s opponents more food for thought.Once the equaliser went in, Brighton enjoyed a spell of dominance. They should have been ahead when Matheus Nunes missed a simple header; Mitoma capitalised and sent his cross for Gómez to tap home from a few yards out. The unmarked Paraguayan, however, conspired to send the ball behind him.Guardiola sent on the remainder of his senior substitutes to inject much-needed energy. The prospect of Rayan Cherki joining the main event brought an element of fear to Brighton but he fired over from promising position. Haaland had a header cleared off the line and should have done far better after another Ayari error, this time passing to Cherki inside the box. It was laid off to Haaland in space but he wasted the chance of victory.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueManchester CityBrighton & Hove Albionmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

He said: “It’s been tough but now I finally did it. Now it’s just up to me and up to us to keep going like that.”When Ayden Heaven turned into his own goal,Burnleywere headed for a first win since 26 October. But Sesko stepped up to show whoever replaces Fletcher, who confirmed he will be in charge for the FA Cup tie with Brighton on Sunday, as the temporary man until the season ends, he may be about to catch fire – before Jaidon Anthony scored a memorable Burnley equaliser.Carrick running Solskjær close in race to become Manchester United’s interim managerRead moreOle Gunnar Solskjær is the slight favourite, ahead of Michael Carrick, and the sight of Shea Lacey hitting the bar should cheer whoever next takes the caretaker role, as will Kobbie Mainoo, another United starlet, entering as a late replacement.After the dour Ruben Amorim era the joke was whether Fletcher would belie a 25-year association with United by sending out the same dour three-man defence. He did not, of course – his configuration a 4‑2‑3‑1 that had the returning Bruno Fernandes as the 10 behind Sesko.The captain was the sole change – for Leny Yoro – from Amorim’s last game, the1-1 draw at Leedson Sunday, and after neat footwork in the buildup Fernandes saw Casemiro balloon over a first effort of Fletcher’s tenure.The Scot was assisted by his former United teammate Jonny Evans, who was regaled by the travelling support with his song that tells of the Northern Irishman’s “hate” for “scousers”. Thirteen minutes in and they were not keen at all on their team as Burnley scored via Heaven.Bashir Humphreys ran into space down the left and pinged the ball in, the centre-back stuck a leg out, and it ricocheted over Senne Lammens. Instantly, the camera panned left to an expressionless Fletcher, then to Omar Berrada and Jason Wilcox, the chief executive and director of football who sacked Amorim on Monday.View image in fullscreenBenjamin Sesko volleys United into a short-lived lead.Photograph: David Blunsden/Action Plus/ShutterstockThis was the first time Scott Parker’s men led since a 3-2 defeat at West Ham on 8 November. Why? Because United lacked imagination. Rare forays ended with Casemiro chipping into the Clarets’ area to no one, or Fernandes berating the stationary Sesko to dart in.Then, craft from United. Fernandes lifted a free-kick into the area, Casemiro headed across goal, and Matheus Cunha drew a Martin Dubravka save that went for a corner. From Luke Shaw’s delivery Lisandro Martínez bundled home but the centre-back was adjudged to have fouled Kyle Walker so the referee, Stuart Attwell, chalked it off.United were jittery, Burnley scented blood. Marcus Edwards ran through midfield and found Lucas Pires along the left and his shot evaded Lammens, barely missing the left corner.At this juncture, there was zero new manager bounce. Instead Fletcher, garbed in a dark blue winter coat, oversaw a passive side who needed to awaken. When Fernandes slipped Patrick Dorgu in the wide left forward lobbed Dubravka before Maxime Estève cleared off the line – better from United ahead of them wandering off for the interval.View image in fullscreenDarren Fletcher applauds the Manchester United fans after the draw at Burnley.Photograph: Phil Duncan/Every Second Media/ShutterstockFletcher followed David Moyes, Ryan Giggs, Louis van Gaal, José Mourinho, Solskjær (interim and permanent), Michael Carrick, Ralf Rangnick, Erik ten Hag, Ruud van Nistelrooy, and Amorim as the 13th appointment to the United hot seat since Sir Alex Ferguson left.Yet he now had only 45 minutes to turn the game around. At the start of this a progressive sequence began by Martínez that moved United from defence to attack and ended in a Dorgu attempt. The next move was lethal, as it featured Heaven and Casemiro and had Fernandes slipping in Sesko: the 22-year-old has struggled since joining in the summer, but a right-foot blast past Dubravka was emphatic.Brighton’s Kaoru Mitoma punishes Manchester City as title bid falters againRead moreThis had Fletcher joyous and urging his team for more. There was. At a Hannibal Mejbri corner United broke, the ball went left, and Sesko was again fed. This time a corner was claimed, which came to nothing, but soon Fernandes was hitting a post, his team discovering its rhythm.And, too, a surfeit of chances. Heaven, left free at Fernandes’s corner, headed wide before Sesko struck again, following Dorgu’s run and cross from the left, with a predatory, sweetly timed low volley.Sesko’s grin dazzled as much as Fletcher’s, United’s faithful gleeful behind the goal where the Slovenian scored. Yet the emotion became Burnley’s when Anthony, on as a substitute, turned away from Shaw and Martínez and beat Lammens with an 18-yard peach that flew in high.At point‑blank range Sesko fluffed a golden chance to snatch the winner and a hat-trick, before Lacey went close, the end result feeling fair on each team.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueBurnleyManchester Unitedmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Nevertheless, after a 2-1 win over Australia in Commerce City, Colorado to end the October window, Pochettino noted he’s building a team with 2030 in mind, too.“It’s not only to think in 2026, it’s to think after … I think it’s our responsibility to create some legacy, or to try to create some core of players that behave in the same way and feel in the same way, respect the values that we were talking about, culture and everything,” Pochettino said. “And after 2026, another period of four years, maybe to have this core of players that can arrive in the next [World Cup] in 2030 in a different situation.”Indeed, 2026 has assumed a be-all and end-all significance for the USMNT program, partly due to their co-host status and partly because the team’s core players are entering their primes. But the window for that coveted potential deep run at the tournament could realistically stretch four more years.“There’s no reason why the core group of guys, led by Christian [Pulisic], at 30, 31 – absolutely you can still play and compete in a World Cup [in 2030],” USMNT legend Landon Donovan told the Guardian.Weston McKennie and Pulisic will be 31 when the 2030 World Cup kicks off (turning 32 later that year). Tyler Adams will be 31 while Chris Richards and Tim Weah will all be 30. Gio Reyna will be 27 (turning 28). Blend in the younger pieces that have emerged in the current cycle closer to his age, such as Folarin Balogun and Tanner Tessmann (both turning 29), and the experience the group will have gained in major tournaments could certainly prove to be an edge. The US could reportedly host the Copa América again in 2028, providing even more tournament exposure.‘A different type of game’: USMNT veterans on how to handle World Cup pressureRead more“I think they’ll be ready [in 2030],” former USMNT manager and defender Gregg Berhalter told the Guardian. “When you think about Croatia performing well at World Cups, they usually have older teams. I think it can be done.”For all their talent, the core of the Croatian team Berhalter referenced still needed three unsuccessful tournaments together before their breakthroughs reaching the World Cup final in 2018 and semi-final in 2022, when the new generation of the US made their major tournament debut. Next summer will be an opportunity to evolve.“Looking back [at Qatar] and seeing how we played and stuff, we were really competitive, we dueled a lot, but we were still a really young team,” Antonee Robinson said. “And there’s little things in games where it could be taking a bit of extra time to do a set piece or getting your breath back, little things like that. Managing the game that comes with experience that four years on from the last tournament, is going to be huge to make sure that’s implemented into the game and we take the front foot on that.”View image in fullscreenCavan Sullivan, 16, starred for the US at the 2025 U-17 World Cup last summer.Photograph: Simon Holmes/USSF/Getty ImagesComplementing that experience could be today’s blue chip prospects at positions of need. Pochettino acknowledged last month that the US is thin on the wing, but Philadelphia Union andManchester City-bound phenom Cavan Sullivanas well as Borussia Dortmund academy gem Mathis Albert – both on display at the recent U-17 World Cup – could provide attacking sparks. Meanwhile, 19-year-old FC Augsburg center back Noahkai Banks is now a regular starter in the Bundesliga. Pochettino called him up in September, and he could even be in the mix this summer.Berhalter noted that the collective progression towards 2030 isn’t a given.“The two things that need to be happening at the same time are team development and individual development, and that’s going to be the determining factor to see if this group can take it to 2030,” he said. “So individuals need to continue to progress at a high rate, and if they do that, there’s enough to say, ‘OK, this will be the third World Cup for this group.’ There’s enough there that you can justifiably say that they could. But that needs to happen.”Speaking to media in Washington DC ahead of the World Cup draw, former USMNT striker Charlie Davies framed it as a matter of a player’s priorities and hunger.“Like, how much do you want to push?” he said. “You play in one World Cup, you play in two World Cups. How important is it that you play in a third World Cup? How important is it for you to keep pushing and staying in Europe and being put in uncomfortable situations? Because I’ll tell you right now, playing in Europe is a grind … it’s a mental battle … Like Weston McKennie, every year, ‘He’s going to be sold, he’s going to not play,’ and he proves himself. But at what point do you go, ‘I’ve had enough of this, man. I’ve proved myself year after year for 10 years.’ And he continues to do it, which is so impressive.”The United States must create big moments at World Cup 2026. Anything less is not enough | Leander SchaerlaeckensRead moreMcKennie could be something of a bellwether for this factor in the national team’s progression over the next World Cup cycle. His contract with Juventus expires in June, and he recently hit the 200 appearances milestone with the Bianconeri. He has said he hopes to stay in Turin, but the latest rumor is that he will not be extending his contract.FC Cincinnati pursued him two summers ago – potentially part of a renewed effort by ambitious clubs in MLS to at least tempt national team stars to come home sooner than they may have otherwise.“[What is] in the back of everyone’s mind is [that] MLS is growing, and it’s not seen as soft any more. I can still go there and get good quality and competition. So do I go back and get that big payday and maybe not have the stress that I would have every single day,” Davies said. “I live a better life, and the pressure, the uncomfortability of week to week is gone. That’s something that you have to think about as you get older, and maybe there’s a family involved. What’s best for your wife and your kids?“So there’s all these things that can change the dynamic, I think, for a lot of these players, but in thinking forward, you’d be crazy not to think, ‘I don’t want to play in a third World Cup.’ Like it’s the ultimate dream. So I think if they want, they could have a big say in that one [in 2030].”Explore more on these topicsUSAUS sportsWorld CupfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The 53-year-old has had a nomadic coaching career that has also seen him working as an assistant manager at the English clubs Manchester United (under Ralf Rangnick) and Leeds United (under Jesse Marsch).Rodman’s future and Liverpool in need to buy – welcome to the women’s transfer windowRead moreArmas led the Red Bulls to theMLSSupporters’ Shield in 2018 after taking over for Marsch, who left mid-season for a job at Red Bull Salzburg. He led the Red Bulls to a disappointing finish in 2019 before being dismissed in 2020. He lasted just 15 games in charge of Toronto FC the next season, losing 10 of those games before being let go. His stints at Manchester United and Leeds United followed. He was hired by the Colorado Rapids ahead of the 2024 season but was fired at the end of the 2025 campaign after missing the playoffs.Armas last coached in the women’s game at the college level, leading the Adelphi University Panthers from 2011 through 2014, boasting an improved record each year capped with an appearance in the NCAA Tournament.During his playing career he earned 66 senior international caps for the US and played 264 MLS games, winning the MLS Cup in 1998. He was named as US Soccer’s male player of the year in 2000.“We are excited to have Chris in Kansas City, and I look forward to working closely with him as we continue to take the club to new heights,” Andonovski told the club’s media channels. “Chris brings a wealth of experience that will be invaluable.”Armas, who already previously was a co-interim head coach of Leeds in February 2023 after Marsch’ sacking, for a Premier League fixture against Manchester United, said of his arrival with last year’s NWSL shield winners: “From the talented group of players, the facilities and passionate fanbase, this club represents a world class environment. Above all, it’s the culture and the people that impressed me most.“I’m inspired by the shared vision of the ownership and staff, and I will do everything I can to help make the KC Current the best women’s football club in the world.”Explore more on these topicsNWSLMLSUS sportsWomen's footballnewsShareReuse this content"

This may come as a surprise to many, but it is not a decision I have made lightly. I have been thinking about it for a long time, and it now feels like the right moment to step away from the sport.”The Lancastrian completed a memorable Giro triumph in June with a spectacular victory on the race’sfinal mountain stage over the Colle delle Finestre, that victory coming as a shock to add to his the 2018 Vuelta a España triumph.Yates recognised that win in Rome as “a huge moment in my career, a defining moment maybe. It’s a sweet success. I’ve spent a lot of my life targeting this race. There’s been a lot of setbacks, and it has been hard to deal with. I’m in disbelief that I have finally managed to pull it off.”In doing so, Yates became only the third British rider – after Chris Froome and Tao Geoghegan Hart – to win the race. William Fotheringham, the Guardian’s former cycling correspondent, said Yates’s “display of courage and cunning” would “go down in cycling’s annals as one of the most improbable heists the sport has witnessed”.A mountain stage victory in the first week of the 2025 Tour de France in the Auvergne would prove to be his last as a professional cyclist and came after two stage wins in 2019. Riding alongside his twin brother Adam in their home town of Bury, Yates rose through the ranks of BritishCycling, before confirming his talent by becoming points race world champion in 2013.View image in fullscreenSimon Yates rides in the Tour de France, where last year he won a mountain stage to add to two other stage wins.Photograph: Tim de Waele/Getty Images“Cycling has been part of my life for as long as I can remember. From racing on the track at the Manchester Velodrome, to competing and winning on the biggest stage and representing my country at the Olympic Games, it has shaped every chapter of my life,” said Yates.“I am deeply proud of what I have managed to achieve and equally grateful for the lessons that came with it. While the victories will always stand out, the harder days and setbacks were just as important. They taught me resilience and patience, and made the successes mean even more.“To everyone who has supported me along the way, from the staff to my teammates, your unwavering belief and loyalty made it possible for me to realise my own dreams. Whenever I doubted myself, you never did. Thank you.”Explore more on these topicsSimon YatesCyclingGiro d'ItalianewsShareReuse this content"

In the Premier League, SAOT involves 30 cameras ­identifying the position of the ball and tracking “up to 10,000” data points on a player’s location but the graphical models used to reach a decision do not match with a player’s actual size.By adding personalised ­avatars, Fifa believes that the precision and speed of decision making will be improved, with the ­avatars ­allowing “the ­system to track ­players ­reliably during fast or obstructed ­movements”.The use of ­player‑­specific dimensions will personalise offside decisions as never before. Fans may be ­wondering whether the avatars will make the 6ft 5in Erling Haaland more likely to be caught offside than the 5ft 7in Lionel Messi.According to Fifa, every player will be scanned before the World Cup to create a 3D model; it said each scan would take “approximately one ­second” and capture “highly accurate body-part dimensions”. These ­models would then be used by VAR in calculating offside via SAOT, and Fifa intends that the models be incorporated into TV coverage so that decisions could be “displayed more realistically and in a more engaging way to fans at stadiums and to viewers around the world”.Also announced as part of an expanded relationship between Fifa and its official technology partner, the Chinese company Lenovo, was a new data platform – Football AI Pro – that is to be made available to all nations at the World Cup and will “help level the playing field” between better- and less-well-resourced nations “in an increasingly data-driven sport”. There is also to be a World Cup edition of the Motorola Razr phone, a Lenovo brand.Infantino said: “The Fifa World Cup in 2026 is going to be the greatest show ever on planet Earth. Seven million people will attend the 104 matches – 104 Super Bowls – dozens of millions of fans will travel to North America to feel the Fifa World Cup vibe, six billion people will watch it from home, and the world will stand still.”Explore more on these topicsWorld Cup 2026Video assistant referees (VARs)FifaWorld CupUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

On the bright side, at least this was a crash course in the modernChelseafor Liam Rosenior.The new head coach saw poor defending undermine flashes of defiance, witnessed his erratic side collect their eighth red card of the season, and heard the away end at Craven Cottage spend much of the second half aim mutinous chants in the direction of Behdad Eghbali, the club’s co-controlling owner.Emery rages at Crystal Palace draw as Glasner extends record against Aston VillaRead moreThis was such an unserious effort from Chelsea. Calum McFarlane, the under-21s coach, was in charge. It was hard not to feel that Rosenior had made his first misstep. He has had a dizzying few days since leaving Strasbourg but it is worth thinking back to Thomas Tuchel taking over from Frank Lampard five years ago. Tuchel came up with a new system on his journey to London, had one training session before his first game and led Chelsea to Champions League glory four months later.Different times. Rosenior preferred to watch from the directors’ box and at least had a good view of the shambles unfold. Chelsea were down to 10 men after Marc Cucurella brought down Harry Wilson when theFulhamwinger was through on goal. The red mist descended, three players picking up bookings for dissent, and there was no containing the discontent from the travelling fans after Raúl Jiménez put Fulham ahead early in the second half.Supporters are not convinced by the project overseen by Eghbali and his fellow investors. Tension has grown since Enzo Maresca’s messy departure and it will not be easy for Rosenior to mend the damage. It begins for him with a trip to Charlton Athletic in the FA Cup on Saturday but the 41-year-old inherits a wounded team. Chelsea are down in eighth place after one win from their past nine league games and even find themselves level on points with Fulham, who made light of a lengthy list of absentees by earning a precious win thanks to a moment of impudence from Wilson in the 81st minute.Fulham were more streetwise. They have gambled on players who have been written off by other clubs. They are proof that experience matters. Jiménez, 34, has three goals in his past five games and is testament to Marco Silva’s ability to keep pushing this experienced group.View image in fullscreenLiam Rosenior (left) talks to the Chelsea co-owner Behdad Eghbali before kick-off against Fulham.Photograph: Mike Hewitt/Getty ImagesThis is a chance for Fulham. They are three points off the top four, although they will need to invest this month if they want to mount a push for European football. “It is nine years since my first game in this country,” Silva said. “I don’t remember many seasons like this, where the league is so tight. That shows the demands.”There is no hiding place at this level. Taking charge for the second and final time, McFarlane stuck to club policy and rotated heavily. Chelsea started well and should have led when Andrey Santos headed a corner against the bar.Santos did not make it to half‑time. The midfielder had to make way for Jorrel Hato after Cucurella’s dismissal. It came when Chelsea failed to reset after a corner. Bernd Leno, the Fulham goalkeeper, hit the ball long and Wilson sped through on goal before tangling Cucurella, whose foul on the edge of the area was a clear denial of an obvious goalscoring opportunity.McFarlane denied that the incident was evidence of a discipline problem. He will head back to the under-21s. They also played but it was uncomfortable when McFarlane asked for their result: it finished 6-2 to Benfica in thePremier LeagueInternational Cup.View image in fullscreenMarc Cucurella tangles with Fulham’s Harry Wilson resulting in a red card for the Chelsea player.Photograph: Justin Setterfield/Getty ImagesRosenior needs to give Chelsea direction. They escaped when Wilson had a goal disallowed for offside but they trailed in the 55th minute. Fulham had shifted from a back five, Kevin replacing Jorge Cuenca at half‑time, and they were ahead when Sander Berge crossed for Jiménez to head past Robert Sánchez after escaping Trevoh Chalobah.There was a response from Chelsea, who levelled when Antonee Robinson headed Pedro Neto’s corner against his own bar and Liam Delap converted the rebound. Yet it did not quell the mutiny. The chants towards Eghbali were constant and there was a banner calling for BlueCo, the consortium that owns Strasbourg and Chelsea, to sell up.It meant Eghbali was pumped when Delap scored. Fulham were undeterred. Silva regained the initiative with positive substitutions and the game was settled when Wilson danced round Hato before squeezing in his seventh goal of the season.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueFulhamChelseamatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Sure enough Dominic Calvert-Lewin and Brenden Aaronson combined to befuddle Howe’s dozing defence. As Thiaw slipped, Aaronson met his centre-forward’s clever pass and unleashed a superlative low shot beyond Nick Pope’s reach.Newcastle equalised four minutes later. Thanks to Miley’s cross, Guimarães’s header, Anthony Gordon’s clever penalty area flick, Nick Woltemade’s subtle touch and an assured left-foot finish from the dangerous Barnes, parity was restored. But only temporarily. Leeds’s second goal came from the penalty spot following Thiaw’s handball. If, given that the German was toppling over at the time, the award of that spot-kick was contentious, it capped an unusually disappointing 45 minutes for the defender.Thiaw had struggled to subdue Calvert-Lewin and could not quite seem to fathom out Aaronson’s highly intelligent positional play as the No 10.View image in fullscreenDominic Calvert-Lewin puts away a Leeds penalty late in added time in the first half.Photograph: Alex Dodd/CameraSport/Getty ImagesDespite Gordon’s deliberate attempt to create a divot by scuffing up the turf around the penalty spot – an endeavour that led to his yellow card – Calvert-Lewin sent Pope the wrong way. It was his ninth goal of the season and eighth in the past nine games. A place in England’s World Cup squad surely beckons.Howe replaced Sven Botman with Thiaw at half-time. With Tonali, rather more controversially, also withdrawn, Tino Livramento came on at right‑back and Miley moved into midfield.Those changes looked vindicated as Joelinton swiftly headed Newcastle level. It was a top-drawer finish conjured when Miley performed minor wonders to keep the ball in play and Guimarães used the outside of his right foot to whip in a superb cross.The glorious craziness only intensified when Pope misread a cross and James Justin’s apparently goalbound header somehow ricocheted off the underside of the crossbar.View image in fullscreenJoelinton drags the scoreline back to 2-2 with an acrobatic header.Photograph: Stu Forster/Getty ImagesAs Schär crumpled in a challenge with Calvert-Lewin the mood darkened. Following several minutes of treatment he was carried off on a stretcher en route to hospital.Leeds promptly capitalised on Yoane Wissa’s slapdash pass and broke with alacrity, leaving Aaronson to expertly score his second goal.Then Aaronson was contentiously deemed to have handled Lewis Hall’s cross inside the area and Guimarães made no mistake from the penalty spot. “It was never a penalty but the referee was under great pressure from the crowd,” Farke said.The scene was then set for Barnes’s final, victorious 102nd-minute act. “It was such a heartbreaking moment,” the Leeds manager said.“It was a top game, a great game but, of course, there were mistakes. It became more like basketball. Both teams were out of control and just went for it.”Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueNewcastle UnitedLeeds Unitedmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

He can do that sometimes; drift in and out of games. When you possess the type of artistry Semenyo does, you can afford such periods of quiet absence.Then came the type of moment that has convinced Manchester City to shell out £65m for his services; the gamechanging ability that can win games and, perhaps, titles for Pep Guardiola’s side.Brighton’s Kaoru Mitoma punishes Manchester City as title bid falters againRead moreWhen it became clear that City was Semenyo’s most likely destination of choice this month,Bournemouthwere adamant their star player would remain on the south coast to face Tottenham before his anticipated departure. With his injury-time winner from the edge of the box, Semenyo showed precisely why. His wonderful strike ended a barren run of 11 winless games for Bournemouth and heaped further misery on a Tottenham side battling myriad problems.It was some way to round off a 26th birthday that also included a standing ovation from all corners of the Vitality Stadium and a farewell lap of his home for the past three years.As he meandered round the pitch after the match, a number of Spurs players remonstrated with some of their beleaguered away fans. The doubts over Thomas Frank grow ever more severe with each game his side fails to win. And there have been plenty of them – 10 of their past 12 in the league. To think, Tottenham even had designs on seeing if Semenyo fancied joining them this month.“He deserved this moment. A moment he will never forget,” said Andoni Iraola, who confirmed Semenyo would now be completing the “formalities” of his move to Manchester City. “It’s not easy to do what he has done. A lot of players would have acted differently. He has never found excuses. He was ready to give whatever we needed. Sometimes football gives you these things.”View image in fullscreenEli Kroupi (right) is congratulated by Marcos Senesi after making it 2-1 to Bournemouth.Photograph: Hongbo Chen/Action Plus/ShutterstockHaving fallen behind when Mathys Tel scored a fine goal after five minutes, the hosts led at half-time courtesy of Evanilson and Eli Junior Kroupi, whose season tally of seven goals makes him the joint-most prolific teenager – alongside Lamine Yamal – across Europe’s top five leagues.By the time João Palhinha scored a wonderful overhead kick to equalise with 20 minutes remaining, Spurs – wearing black armbands in memory ofthe club legend Martin Chivers, whose death was announced shortly before kick-off – looked the most likely winner. Richarlison hit a post and Micky van de Ven was awarded a penalty that was then overturned on viewing the pitchside monitor.Another defeat is a sucker punch for a club in an increasingly desperate position. Of further concern is an injury problem heading towards crisis proportions. To Dominic Solanke, James Maddison, Dejan Kulusevski and Mohammed Kudus – all of whom missed this match – Spurs also lost Lucas Bergvall and Rodrigo Bentancur to issues in the second half.“It’s very tough to sit here when we haven’t got anything out of an overall good performance,” Frank said. “The players gave everything. To sit here and concede in the five minutes of extra time is very painful, very tough. But that’s football.”Spurs’ manager also inadvertently landed himself in an embarrassing situation when he was photographed drinking out of an Arsenal‑branded cup, following Arsenal’s visit to the Vitality Stadium last weekend.View image in fullscreenJoão Palhinha thought he had secured a point for Spurs with his acrobatic overhead kick, but it was not to be.Photograph: Jeremy Landey/Focus Images Ltd/Shutterstock“I definitely did not notice it,” he said. “It’s fair to say not winning every single football match, it would be absolutely stupid of me to [intentionally] take an Arsenal cup.”The problems are mounting. Since the start of last season, only Wolves have endured morePremier Leaguedefeats than Tottenham’s 30, while their shots per game average under Frank is the lowest in the 25 years the statistics have been recorded.Explaining the exchange of some strong words between Spurs players and fans after the final whistle, Palhinha said: “It was just the supporters were sharing their frustrations. We, of course, understand. We respect them, first of all. I just said we are fighting for all the same. We want to win, not just the players – the staff and the supporters. We are trying to get the wins that, in my opinion, we deserve in the last games. I felt we were the best team on the pitch. It’s a punch in the stomach.”Defeat did seem cruel on the visitors. But Semenyo was working to his own script.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueBournemouthTottenham Hotspurmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

The Irishman’s exemplary rookie season as a head coach continued with Brentford’s commanding win against Le Bris’sSunderland. The visitors’ west London trip will undoubtedly be remembered for Enzo Le Fée’s failed attempt to dupe Caoimhín Kelleher from the penalty spot. Within minutes of that, the finishing of Igor Thiago took the game beyond reach.Aside from theirgoalless New Year’s Day reunionwith Thomas Frank, Brentford have been turning on the style. Bees fans dream of European travel next season. “I know I’m out here, the one speaking all the time, and the face, but it’s not all about me,” Andrews said. “It’s about the people that we have in the club, the talented individuals, staff, players and how hard we’ve worked – and how much we’ve stuck together because at different football clubs, I think I may well have struggled.”This was heralded as the season of the big striker, and Thiago is proving the best of the new wave of No 9s, already enjoying the most prolificPremier Leagueseason ever for a Brazilian in taking his goal tally to 16. “I wasn’t expecting to score so much, but I just want to keep going,” he said.View image in fullscreenMan of the moment: Igor Thiago is helping to keep the league’s golden boot race competitive.Photograph: Tony O Brien/Reuters“He’s a complete centre‑forward,” said Andrews. “I wouldn’t be swapping him for anybody. I don’t know how many have come from the Bulgarian league to the Belgian league, had a year out injured, and then affected the league like this.”Before his first goal, Thiago was twice denied in an opening 30 minutes that concluded with Vitaly Janelt winning the ball from Nordi Mukiele. A perfectly weighted pass allowed Thiago to round Robin Roefs without breaking stride.Newcastle’s Harvey Barnes hits 102nd-minute winner in 4-3 Leeds thrillerRead more“It’s about duels, it’s about composure with the ball, and the duels we had were in favour ofBrentford,” said Le Bris, who made two quick changes within moments of the second half’s resumption, swapping in Romaine Mundle and Eliezer Mayenda. His team had begun creating chances, Le Fée firing over, Omar Alderete and Mundle both denied before the fateful penalty was awarded after Kristoffer Ajer both manhandled and tripped Brian Brobbey.Le Fée’s attempt to Panenka his penalty was risible, Kelleher staying stock still for a dolly catch. The guilty party had no chance of styling it out and home fans jeered the replay on the big screen. “When we win, we react as a team, when we lose, we react as a team,” Le Bris said. “When you don’t take risks you don’t make mistakes.”View image in fullscreenEnzo Le Fée sees Caoimhín Kelleher fail to be flustered by his attempted Panenka penalty, the Brentford goalkeeper catching the ball straightforwardly.Photograph: Andrew Fosker/ShutterstockPunishment was added to embarrassment when, after Kevin Schade hit the bar, the ball was recycled for Thiago to score. Another exchange with Schade might have resulted in Thiago’s second hat-trick in two games but Roefs saved. The treble never came, the striker departing as a precaution after an ankle knock.From a corner, Yehor Yarmoliuk bundled in the third. The Ukrainian midfielder, scoring his first Brentford goal, is another player flourishing under Andrews’s tutelage. “He’s just insatiable the way he attacks the game. I think he’s relishing the players that he’s playing with, some really good experienced pros,” said the former set-piece specialist coach whose appointment now looks less a gamble than a masterstroke.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueBrentfordSunderlandmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

The Wolves recovery continued at Everton yet their impressive resolve under Rob Edwards was overshadowed by the ludicrous red card that should embarrass Professional Match Game Officials and thePremier League.Common sense and elite level referees parted company long ago but the decision to dismiss Michael Keane for violent conduct after he pulled Tolu Arokodare’s dreadlocks while challenging for a header defied belief. João Neves and Jack Stephens on Marc Cucurella this was not. Once Thomas Kirk was sent to the pitchside monitor by the video assistant referee, Chris Kavanagh, however, the league’s newest referee was never going to challenge his superiors by asking where their senses had gone.Darren Fletcher’s Manchester United held by Burnley despite Sesko doubleRead moreKeane was duly shown a straight red card and must serve a three-match ban unlessEvertonappeal and win. Jack Grealish received the first red card of his Premier League career minutes later for two bookable shows of dissent in quick succession. Everton, comfortable before Edwards’s substitutions sparked a vast second-half improvement from Wolves, would have been punished further but for a magnificent fingertip save by Jordan Pickford to deny Hugo Bueno in stoppage time.To say David Moyes was incandescent over Keane’s dismissal would rank as the understatement of the season. The Everton manager struggled to contain profanities as he raged at the state of officiating in the Premier League. “It is not violent, it is not forceful and it is not deliberate,” Moyes said. “So it shouldn’t have been a red card. It was a really poor decision to send him to the screen in the first place. Cucurella got his hair pulled – violent conduct, a deliberate action, no problem with that. But this was in the game, on a ball coming up.“I have been a centre-half and there is no way I am jumping to outjump a big centre-forward and think: ‘By the way I am going to outjump him and at the same time I am going to pull his hair.’ I don’t know anyone on the planet who is good enough to think that way. It was a ridiculous decision by the referee but more by VAR. It can’t be violent conduct for that. Ridiculous. Hopeless.”View image in fullscreenMichael Keane scores an early goal to put Everton ahead.Photograph: Peter Powell/ReutersEdwards apologised for “doing an Arsène Wenger impression” and claimed he had only seen the incident once on the giant screens, which prompted howls of derision from the home crowd and several Everton players to put their heads in their hands. Keane’s dismissal came in the 83rd minute, Grealish’s in the 90th, and the Wolves head coach was more concerned with his team’s inability to capitalise against nine men during nine minutes of added time. But he could take immense heart from their second-half performance and a third game unbeaten for the league’s bottom club. It was so nearly a second successive win, too.Everton controlled a low-quality first half without facing any serious threat. Moyes’s side opened the scoring when Dwight McNeil swung over a free-kick from the left and João Gomes, beating James Tarkowski to the ball, headed a clearance straight to Tim Iroegbunam. The Everton midfielder miscued a shot across the face of goal but Keane reacted superbly to volley into the roof of José Sá’s net for his third goal of the campaign. The Everton central defender went close to his second goal of the game when heading a James Garner free-kick against a post.Wolves were transformed by Edwards’s half-time introduction of André and the later arrival of Jørgen Strand Larsen. The towering striker had only been on the pitch a minute when he dropped deep to receive Yerson Mosquera’s pass out of defence, he then turned and dissected the Everton rearguard with a fine ball into the path of Mateus Mané. The hugely promising 18-year-old accelerated away from the static Jake O’Brien and Tarkowski to beat Pickford with a clinical finish into the bottom corner.View image in fullscreenMateus Mané continued his excellent recent form by scoring a lovely solo goal for Wolves.Photograph: Brett Patzke/WWFC/Getty ImagesThe visitors had grown in confidence and control before the equaliser but, despite the reds for Keane and Grealish, could not take full advantage. “We will fight until the end of the 38th game,” Edwards said.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueEvertonWolverhampton Wanderersmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

TheCrystal Palacemanager has been struggling with a threadbare squad that still has not recorded a victory for several weeks but stretched his unbeaten record against Emery to seven matches after a game which both sides felt they could have won.A late Victor Lindelöf header that struck a post was the closest anyone came in the end as neither Adam Wharton nor Morgan Rogers could quite inspire their sides to victory in front of the England manager, Thomas Tuchel, watching on in the stands. But despite losing Emiliano Martínez to injury at half-time, it was Villa who ended the evening more frustrated as they missed an opportunity to move into second place in the table despite bombarding the Palace goal in the final 10 minutes.Newcastle’s Harvey Barnes hits 102nd-minute winner in 4-3 Leeds thrillerRead moreA furious Emery made a beeline for the officials at the final whistle after their failure to award a penalty to Youri Tielemens four minutes from full time when Brennan Johnson appeared to haul the Belgium midfielder down as a corner was delivered.“I don’t know which one was in the VAR, but if they checked the possible penalty, for me it was clear,” he said. “I am so proud of how we played the match, not enough because one point is not enough. But how we are overall in the table on [match]day 21, I think we must accept this point and keep going.”Much has changed since Palace inflicted their fifth win in their past six meetings against Villa under Glasner in August, with Emery’s side having recovered from their slow start to emerge as potential rivals to Arsenal and Manchester City. The Spaniard insisted beforehand that he did not need any extra motivation from his poor record against Palace that includesa 3-0 defeat in the FA Cup semi-finallast May. But judging by his demeanour on the touchline throughout, Emery seemed to be relishing the challenge until his anger boiled over.Glasner spent the buildup fielding questions over his future after being installed as the early favourite to take over at Manchester United next season. He was pleased with how his side responded after being forced to deploy Justin Devenny at right wing-back after being reduced to only 13 fit senior outfield players due to a mounting injury list.Palace are understood to be making progress on a deal to sign Zakaria El Ouahdi from the Belgian side Genk as they await the return of Daniel Muñoz from a knee injury, although Glasner has insisted his decision whether to sign a new contract will not depend on new arrivals this month.Villa will definitely need to add more depth to their squad if they are to have any chance of keeping up with Arsenal, with Ollie Watkins not making the most of several chances that fell his way against a Palace defence that was well organised by the outstanding Marc Guéhi. He left the field deep in conversation with his England teammate Ezri Konsa – a partnership that could yet prove to be Tuchel’s first choice in the summer if John Stones’s injury issues go on.View image in fullscreenDean Henderson pulls off a save to deny Ollie Watkins.Photograph: Ian Tuttle/Shutterstock“I’m pretty sure our chairman will ask a very high price for him,” Glasner said of City’s interest in signing Guéhi this month. “The fans can be really calm but you never know what will happen.”Dean Henderson was finally called into action when Tielemens set up Watkins in the 25th minute but the Palace goalkeeper was quickly out to smother him before Maxence Lacroix made a timely tackle to stop Watkins in full flow. Martínez was unable to emerge for the second half due to a calf issue and Tielemens should have done better when the ball fell to him invitingly at the back post after Lindelöf’s header from a free‑kick. Henderson then had to react quickly with his legs after a shot deflected off Lacroix.Marco Bizot could only parry Yeremy Pino’s shot into the path of Devenny but the Northern Irishman’s decision to take a touch cost him dear. Palace were then denied a penalty for a potential foul on Guéhi by Boubacar Kamara following a goalmouth scramble that ended with Johnson being booked for diving.Jean-Philippe Mateta was centimetres away from connecting with Johnson’s cross with 11 minutes remaining. Villa came even closer to snatching the victory when Lindelöf’s header came back off a post from a free‑kick before Rogers blazed over from inside the area in the last minute.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueCrystal PalaceAston Villamatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Our players will wear black armbands during this evening’s fixture against AFC Bournemouth. Rest in peace, Martin. One of the all-time greats.”Chivers started his career with his home-city club Southampton, making his debut in 1962, and joined Spurs in 1968.After a long, successful spell there he moved to Switzerland to play for Servette, where he won further honours, before returning toEnglandto play for clubs including Norwich and Brighton.Southampton said they were “deeply saddened” by the death of Chivers, who made 189 appearances for the club, scoring 108 goals. Hescored 174 times in 367 competitive games for Spurs, including both goals to beat Aston Villa in the 1971 League Cup final and two to help defeat Wolves in the two-leg 1972 Uefa Cup final.

Dennis Bergkamp holds that record for Arsenal with 16 in 1997-98.Arteta was asked whether that was a concern or whether he preferred to spread the goals around the team. “We want the goals to be spread and our strikers to score over 20 goals,” he said. “That’s the idea.”Kai Havertz, last season’s leading league scorer with nine, could return against Liverpool after a long-term knee injury and Gabriel Jesus is pushing for a start in place of Gyökeres. But Arteta rejected suggestions that the competition could bring the best out of the playersigned from Sporting for £64min the summer.“I don’t think it’s related,” he said. “We’re not going to change Viktor’s desire or his attitude or his work rate or how much he’s willing to score goals because he’s got another player in [competition], because of the circumstances.

Successive drawsagainst FulhamandLeedshave prompted further criticism of Slot’s style and resulted in the champions falling 14 points behind the leaders, Arsenal, who they face at the Emirates Stadium on Thursday.TheLiverpoolhead coach admits being stung by accusations his team’s approach is dull. “I find it really hard to hear but I would not completely disagree,” said Slot, who could be without Hugo Ekitiké for a second successive game. “I would use different words and I would take certain things into account. I want to win as many trophies as I can but I think I am also known for the fact that my teams always try to play attacking football and I can only say they’re trying to do so.Quick GuideHow do I sign up for sport breaking news alerts?ShowDownload the Guardian app from the iOS App Store on iPhone or the Google Play store on Android by searching for 'The Guardian'.If you already have the Guardian app, make sure you’re on the most recent version.In the Guardian app, tap the Profile settings button at the top right, then select Notifications.Turn on sport notifications.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.“We are struggling to create a lot of chances. But I’ve said many times, we are not the only team that struggles to create a lot of chances. I don’t like to hear this [boring label] of course. I would like us winning a lot of games but also playing an attractive style of football which we have done this season. We have to find a way against teams [who play] in not an attractive way, which is, of course, maybe even smart for them to do. We have to find answers to that. We haven’t found enough yet but we are working on that every single day to improve that.”Slot insists recent team selections have been born of necessity with Ekitiké joining Alexander Isak on the sidelines owing to a minor hamstring issue, Cody Gakpo returning from injury and Mohamed Salah at the Africa Cup of Nations.“Packing the team with midfielders is not something I am doing by choice,” he said. “I am doing it because certain players are not available. I have always played with wingers and I have always changed my wingers with new wingers coming in. If I am known for one thing then it is attacking football, playing a lot of attackers and bringing a lot of attackers in when we are a goal down. So I find it hard to hear that we play boring football let alone that I am not playing attackers.”The Dutch coach admits he had to stabilise Liverpool after conceding 10 goals in three consecutive losses to Manchester City, Nottingham Forest and PSV before the unbeaten run. But Slot, who dropped Salah after the PSV home defeat, insists stability has not been founded on defensive football.“I agree that [steadying the ship] was the first thing that needed to happen but I didn’t do that to play defensive football,” he said. “I think that is the misconception. We always pressed the other team as high as we can up the pitch, all over the pitch. And when we have the ball, we try to create as many chances as we can. Everyone can see that we don’t create enough chances but I haven’t gone to a style of football where I started to play five at the back or we started to go all defending our own box. Not at all.“I did not change our style but teams have changed their style against us. My football is Liverpool v Paris Saint Germain. That is how I would love to have every single game but you need to have two teams to have an open game of football and not all these things [long balls and low blocks] that don’t make a game of football nice.”Slot would not be drawn on whether Liverpool plan a renewed bid for Crystal Palace’s captain, Marc Guéhi,who is of interest to Manchester City, or whether Harvey Elliott could return from an unsuccessful loan to Aston Villa. Liverpool do not have a recall option on Elliott, who joined Villa on a season’s loan with an obligation to buy for £35m providing he played 10 league games.“I am really happy with the squad we have,” Slot said. “All the decisions made last summer and the summer before are completely aligned with me, Richard [Hughes, sporting director] and the ownership. This season has shown how talented this group is and if everyone is available how good a team we can be. This club is in a very good place if everyone is available, and we are getting stronger and stronger for the short-term future but definitely also for the mid-to-long-term future.”Explore more on these topicsLiverpoolArne SlotnewsShareReuse this content"

The Enhanced Games allows the use of performance-enhancing substances and permits athletes to take substances approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA), under strict supervision.Global anti-doping chief admits drugs cheats in sport are escaping detectionRead moreIn a statement, the former Olympic long-distance runner Buckner said: “As a former athlete, I find this particularly appalling. Those of us who have competed know what it takes to succeed the right way – through talent, dedication, and respect for the rules. To see a British athlete aligning themselves with an event that celebrates the use of performance-enhancing drugs is profoundly disappointing.”In September 2025, the Olympic silver swimming medallistBen Proud announced that he would be participatingin the event, making him the first British athlete to join.Prescod won a silver medal at the 2018 European championships and competed at Tokyo 2020 before announcing his retirement in August last year.The statement from UK Athletics added: “UK Athletics is disappointed by reports that former Great Britain sprinter Reece Prescod intends to take part in the so-called Enhanced Games.“UKA does not recognise the Enhanced Games as a legitimate sporting competition. Any event that promotes or permits the use of harmful substances with the aim of pushing the human body to its limit for short-term goals is not sport as we value it.“This concept fundamentally undermines the integrity of competition, places athletes’ health and welfare at serious risk, and is incompatible with the principles of clean sport that underpin athletics in the UK and worldwide. The very reason clean sport exists is because those involved saw the risks that resulted from athletes taking substances that led to severe life changing harms.“Over the years British athletes have experienced the devastating impact of doping, through losing the opportunities afforded from winning major medals, receiving recognition only years later, or by having medals removed, so it is disappointing to see a former team member demonstrate disregard in this manner.“UKA’s Clean Athletics Policy is clear: doping and the use of prohibited substances or methods will not be tolerated. While Reece Prescod is no longer part of the UKA performance system, his decision to associate with an event that directly contravenes both our policy and the World Anti-Doping Code is unacceptable.”Explore more on these topicsAthleticsDrugs in sportnewsShareReuse this content"

It is understood the committee took the decision at a meeting on Wednesday. It will keep its X account, which has about 27,000 followers, in existence but dormant, to ensure no one else can take it over.While the decision concerns only the committee’s account, some individual members, including Owen, have already stopped using X. Another, the Liberal Democrat MP Christine Jardine, said she was leaving the platform, calling the images generated by Grok “the last straw”.Jardine said she had taken the view that X was a good way to communicate with constituents. “But I cannot in all conscience continue to use a platform which seems unwilling to act against this grossly offensive and abusive online behaviour towards women and girls,” she said.Owen also plans to write to the Cabinet Office and to Ofcom to urge action against X. She said: “I personally came off X in 2024 after the platform and its owner promoted and paid creators of far-right racist and misogynistic material. The committee heard at the end of last year on inquiries about community cohesion that X posts regularly break UK law on hate speech.“In recent days, X and xAI have allowed the creation and sharing of AI deepfakes, non-consensual intimate imagery, and child sexual abuse material – all areas identified as online violence against women and girls by our committee.“We do not view it as appropriate to use such a platform to share our work. I hope that the government, Ofcom and relevant law enforcement agencies work quickly to make X immediately abide by UK law on online safety and non-consensual intimate image abuse, to be held to account for its failures and if it refuses to abide by our laws, it must be appropriately sanctioned.”On Monday, Ofcom said it was aware of serious concerns raised about Grok creating images of undressed people and sexualised images of children. It said it had contacted X and xAI “to understand what steps they have taken to comply with their legal duties to protect users in the UK” and would assess the need for an investigation based on the company’s response.Starmer’s spokesperson said: “What we have seen on Grok is a disgrace. It is completely unacceptable. No one should have to go through the ordeal of deepfakes of themselves online, and we won’t allow the proliferation of these demeaning images.“X needs to deal with this urgently, and Ofcom has our full backing to take enforcement action wherever firms are failing to protect UK users. It already has the power to issue fines of up to billions of pounds and even stop access to a site that is violating the law. And when it comes to keeping people safe online, all options remain on the table.”Asked about the issue, Kemi Badenoch’s spokesperson said the Conservative leader agreed with the government: “We both find it absolutely abhorrent and want to see it clamped down upon as soon as possible.”Asked if this could mean Badenoch, an enthusiastic user of X who has 350,000 followers, might leave the platform, the spokesperson said: “We are very clear that what is happening with those Grok deepfakes is absolutely disgusting and there has to be some something done to stop that. I’m not about to announce policy here.”Earlier on Wednesday, Nigel Farage was asked if he was happy to earn money from a site that had a business model based in part on child sexual abuse material. The Reform UK leader is paid for engagement on the site as a much-followed verified user.Farage avoided the question but said he was “very worried” about the images and he believed X would listen to the criticism.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

Their thankless existence involves repeatedly cleaning one of the grimmest parts of the body, then being thrown out once their bristles are insufficiently effective. Or, in the case ofelectric toothbrushes, decapitated before resuming their duties with a fresh head.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.This relentless cycle is essential for hygiene reasons: an ineffective brush can lead directly to tooth decay and gum disease. However, given the big dual crises of our time – climate and cost of living – it would certainly help for toothbrushes to last a bit longer. So what can we do to maximise their longevity without sacrificing dental hygiene?How to make your toothbrush last longerDon’t overcharge the batteryView image in fullscreenPowering on: get the most out of a toothbrush battery by only recharging when it’s required.Photograph: sanatgen/Getty ImagesEvery electric toothbrush has a battery inside the handle that, just as with a phone, will degrade over time. In most cases, this battery isn’t easily replaceable, so treating it well is essential.“In general, it’s best not to charge your battery frequently, whether it’s ours or any other [toothbrush brand’s] batteries,” says Gyve Safavi, co-founder of the electric toothbrush maker Suri, which has made sustainability a key selling point.Frequent charging erodes battery capacity, he says. “If you want it to last as long as possible, charge it overnight and leave it. Don’t charge it again until it goes out.”Read ourSuri 2.0 electric toothbrush reviewKeep it cleanYou may think that keeping your brush clean is a hygiene-only issue, but it’s also helpful for bristle longevity.“I have seen patients ruin heads more from storage habits than from brushing,” says Dr Alan McCaffrey, founder of Red Rock Dental in Las Vegas. “Both electric and manual brushes can last longer than most people think if they are cared for correctly, but they should never be used past the point where bristles are frayed or ineffective.“One way to extend the life of the head is to rinse it thoroughly in hot water after every use and then let it air dry upright,” he says. “Moisture trapped at the base [of the bristle] is what causes buildup and weakens bristles faster.”Dr Nicole Khalife, owner of Lux Smiles in New York, agrees. “Clean bristles dry faster than those that stay sticky. Dry bristles are less friendly to germs, and the brush lasts longer.”Some toothbrushes come with travel caps: small covers that can be placed over the head of the brush to protect it from dirt and detritus in luggage. But you should only use them when on the road, Khalife says. “They protect the head from dirt in a suitcase, but at home, they trap moisture. Use a ventilated pouch instead of a solid cap and always let the brush dry before packing it.”If your brush doesn’t fully dry between uses, you could switch between brushes or heads each day, McCaffrey suggests. “Giving the bristles a day to fully dry helps them keep their shape and stiffness for longer.”Look after the bodyIt’s not just the heads that need cleaning. There’s usually a visible gap between them and the body, and excess toothpaste can calcify around here, which could interfere with how the brush functions. Use a damp cloth to gently remove this, and then dry it thoroughly when done.Allowing the brush to air dry is important, especially when it comes to charging. I’m pretty sure I got through a couple of Suri 1.0 chargers after repeated contact with a damp brush caused rust on the conductive metal connectors.Watch your techniqueView image in fullscreenGently does it is the advice from dental experts on the pressure needed when brushing.Photograph: AlexBr1972/Getty ImagesStorage is only one part of the toothbrush longevity puzzle. “Many people press hard because they think it makes their teeth cleaner,” says Khalife. “In fact, intense pressure bends the bristles and scratches the enamel. A gentle circular motion works better because the tips of the bristles sweep away plaque without flattening the fibres. Bristles that keep their shape will reach between teeth and along the gumline for the whole life of the brush.”Electric toothbrushes have an advantage here, with users encouraged to let the motor’s vibrations do the work, rather than brushing as with manual ones.“Electric toothbrushes are designed to help prevent over-brushing, which can cause damage to your enamel and gums,” says Barty Walsh, CEO and founder of electric toothbrush maker Ordo. “If you’re going through brush heads faster than two to three months, this is a sign you may need to change your brushing technique.”It’s worth looking for an electric model with a pressure sensor, which will warn you when you’re pushing too hard.Resist the latest modelFrom a sustainability and consumption perspective, you’d ideally not buy a new model – no matter how shiny and wonderful the adverts make it look.“The best thing we can all do is use what we have for as long as we can,” says Suri’s Safavi.… but know when (and how) to say ‘goodbye’View image in fullscreen‘Bamboo toothbrushes are the easiest to recycle.’Photograph: Yulia Lisitsa/AlamyEventually, all toothbrushes will die, and continuing to brush with them beyond their useful lifespan is bad for your teeth. If your manual brush’s bristles are splayed beyond recognition, or your electric brush’s battery will no longer hold a charge, then it’s time to dispose of it responsibly and move on.Bamboo brushes are the easiest to recycle: remove the nylon bristles, and then compost the bamboo handle or find an alternative use for it (see below).For plastic manual brushes, it’s worth seeing if the manufacturer has a recycling programme. If not, you can see ifTerracyclehas a collection point near you.If there’s no local option bar landfill, you can always find alternative uses for brushes. Even splayed bristles can be effective at cleaning between bathroom tiles. While I wasable to donate the electric toothbrush bodies from my group test, the heads were rightly considered unhygienic, so they have enjoyed a second life cleaning my cats’ grubby chins.Some brands recycle brush heads free of charge, including Suri and Ordo, whileLiveCoco,BrushdandEdincosell recyclable heads for Oral-B and Philips Sonicare devices.

That said, they’re not a clean win for sustainability as they rely on lithium-ion batteries. There are myriad environmental issues here, from thehuge water use, land degradation andchemical leakageassociated with the mining of Earth minerals, tohazards connected to the batteries’ disposal.There are several more sustainable manual options – particularly those with a bamboo body – which promise a more environmentally friendly middle ground. However, as I covered in my guide to thebest electric toothbrushes, experts agree that manual brushes aren’t generally as effective at teeth cleaning.As Caitlin Miller, head of hygiene and therapy at Bupa Dental Care UK, put it to me at the time: “To get the same level of cleaning found with an electric toothbrush, you’d have to spend a lot longer than two minutes brushing with a manual.”For more ideas to help your favourite items last longer:From beeswax to baby wipes: how to make your leather last a lifetime‘Glass chopping boards should be illegal’: how to look after your kitchen knivesFrom cloths to cleaning tablets: how to make your coffee machine last longerExplore more on these topicsHealth & wellbeingThe FilterGadgetsHygienefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Sign up hereKeza MacDonaldWed 7 Jan 2026 10.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 7 Jan 2026 10.02 ESTShareIt had begun to feel like an endurance test by the end, but nonetheless, like the sucker I am, I watched theStranger Thingsfinale last week. Andspoiler warning: I’m going to talk about it in general terms in this newsletter. Because approximately 80% of the final season comprised twentysomething “teenagers” explaining things to each other while using random 1980s objects to illustrate convoluted plans and plot points, my expectations were not high. After an interminable hour, finally, something fun happens, as the not-kids arm themselves with machine guns and molotovs and face off against a monstrously gigantic demon-crab. Aha, I thought – the final boss battle!The fight was like something out of Monster Hunter, all scale and spectacle with a touch of desperation. For a very long time, video games sought to imitate cinema. Now cinema (and TV) often feels like a video game. The structure of Stranger Things’ final season reminded me a lot of Resident Evil: long periods of walking slowly through corridors, with characters exchanging plot information aloud on their way to the action, and occasional explosions of gunfire, screeching monsters or car chases. Those long periods of relative inaction are much more tolerable when you’ve got a controller in your hands. I am all for TV and film embracing the excitement, spectacle and dynamism of video games, but do they have to embrace the unnecessary side-quests and open-world bloat, too?The reciprocally influential relationship between games, TV and film has developed a lot in the last few years. Ageneration of gen X and elder-millennial gamers have recently aged into creative and commissioning power in these industries. That’s why we’re getting people such as Jonathan Nolan heading up an excellentFallout TV show, and indeed why all video-game-to-screen adaptations have become dramatically less terrible in the past five years or so. It also inevitably means that the boundaries between interactive and non-interactive entertainment are becoming more porous: where previously game-makers were heavily influenced by film (primarily but notexclusively Alien/s and Star Wars), now that relationship works both ways. Most Marvel movies look and feel like a video game to me, and not just because they’re all full of computer-generated graphics. It’s the mood and pace of them.View image in fullscreenAnyone for Halo? … Emily Blunt in 2014 movie Edge of Tomorrow.Photograph: David James/Warner Bros/AllstarEdge of Tomorrow remains the most video-game-ish movie I’ve ever seen: its premise revolves around dying and respawning, trying out different things on each run. It’s a sci-fi roguelike of a film. I wanted to playMad Max: Fury Roadthe entire time I was watching it, and John Wick 4 was literally a fighting-game boss rush. When film critics say that a film feels like a video game, they often mean it disparagingly; a lot of cinephiles still see games as the lower form. When I say a movie feels like a video game, it’s a compliment – unless it feels like aboringvideo game.This was the problem, for me, with Stranger Things: every episode felt like loading up an open-world game that I hadn’t played for a few months. More and more characters kept appearing, and I didn’t remember or care who most of them were. Between the Upside Down, Vecna’s mindscape, real-world Hawkins and an entirely new dimension introduced in the last couple of episodes, there were too many locations to keep track of. Every episode brought on the mild despair I feel when I think I’m near the end of an overlong game, only to discover yet another entirely new area to explore. The painfully long epilogue, meanwhile, was rivalled only by Red Dead Redemption 2’s interminable post-game hours. Please, just let it end already!Of course, in modern pop culture, nothing is ever allowed to end properly, not if it’s still making money. I’m surprised there’s been no word of an official Stranger Things video game tie-in (outside of a retro-style smartphone beat-em-up from 2019). Come to think of it, we don’t see many of these kinds of licensed games any more: back in the 00s and 2010s, most major movies and TV shows launched with an interactive accompaniment. Presumably this is because of the spiralling cost of game development – you can’t knock out a mediocrePlayStation2 game in nine months any more – but also, when TV shows feel so much like games, do we really need an adaptation anyway?What to playView image in fullscreenStrange and surreal … Indika.Photograph: Odd MeterThe first game I’ve finished in 2026 isIndika, a surreal and mildly horrible game about a young nun questioning her faith and having conversations with the devil as she goes on an extremely strange journey through bleak, snow-covered villages and abandoned factories with an escaped convict. There are much-needed flashes of humour in here, but also stuff about religion, control and sexuality that I haven’t seen in a video game before. It’s also part of a small wave of games (see Baby Steps) that mocks gamer mentality: there are points, but they are pointless; explore off the beaten path and you will find something useless and inconsequential rather than a secret or something fun. And that’s if you find anything at all.Available on:PC, PS5, Xbox, Nintendo SwitchEstimated playtime:five hoursWhat to readView image in fullscreenInnovator … Sega’s David Rosen, who died in December.Photograph: American Amusement Machine AssociationDavid Rosen, the co-founder of Sega and an influential figure in the history of arcade video games, died on Christmas Day at 95.

I guessed GTA, Fortnite, Call of Duty, Minecraft and EA FC, but don’t have huge confidence in that!You’re not far off. According to data from Circana, the top five most played games on PlayStation 5 this year were exactly the same as last year:Fortnite,Call of Duty,Grand Theft Auto 5(including Online),RobloxandMinecraft. All of these games are five to 10-plus years old. This stagnation at the top is why every big publisher has spent millions in the last decade trying to create live-service games, and why most of them have flopped. Last year on Steam, meanwhile, only 14% of all playtime was spent on new games released in 2025. Any developer releasing something new, be they blockbuster or indie, is competing for a sliver of a sliver of players’ time and money. These stats explain a lot about why the games industry is where it is right now, and why there’s such a bleak mood among many developers.Explore more on these topicsGamesPushing Buttons newsletterStranger ThingsMad Max: Fury RoadEdge of TomorrowTelevisionPlayStationfeaturesShareReuse this content"

What is the basis of their territorial claim? … The US is the power of Nato … obviously Greenland should be part of the United States.” His wife, Katie Miller,posted an image on Xof a map of the country papered over with the US flag, with the caption “soon”. It’s hard to orientate sensibly towards things that happen on X these days: if she had posted a Grok-generated image of Greenland in a bikini, would that be more or less concerning?Still, we’re right to be concerned. There is no comfort to be had from old-era ideas such as: “Maybe they’re just sabre-rattling aboutGreenlandto distract from the matter of Venezuela”, or “surely the foundational principles of Nato, a defensive alliance, will prevent the US from any act of aggression towards its own allies?”The question is, by what logic does Trump make his claim? He talks a lot about theMonroe doctrine, describes his foreign policy as its “Trump corollary”, but close watchers ofHamilton, the musical, will sniff out immediately that Trump is no heir to the doctrine’s origins in the Federalist papers, which essentially wanted Europe to curtail its colonial ambitions and butt out of the Americas. The 2020s version is fixated with the western hemisphere, which Greenland is in, but Denmark is not. This is the basis for Miller’s confident dismissal of centuries of Scandinavian relationships: the meridian says no.The US national security strategypublished last Novemberuses “hemisphere” incessantly, introducing the idea of “non-hemispheric competitors”, a phrase commentators have now taken up, as if it were a foundational idea in geopolitics, rather than some retro-imperialist garbage invented five minutes ago. The short version is the same as the long version: everything in the western hemisphere must remain “stable and well-governed” enough to serve the US’s interests and prevent mass migration there. Trump’s definition of stability and good governance is antithetical to ours. His ideas on preventing mass migration are necropolitical and feature nothing that would, in real life, prevent it (such as halting runaway climate breakdown and fostering peace). Therefore, as an overriding agenda, this cannot be taken at face value, but rather, as a justification for dominion.If you’re the kind of person who likes clicking on maps, you could spend an enjoyable half hour looking at which bits of the UK Trump could lay claim to, under his hemispheric approach: Norwich would be fine;Scotlandwould not.Which brings us to the next relevant item in their security agenda, a desire to restore “Europe’s civilizational self-confidence and Western identity”. This has been plain since JD Vancehectored European leadersat the Munich Security Conference under a year ago, accusing them of retreating from their “fundamental values” . When he spoke of Christianity and freedom of speech, he meant whiteness and hate speech. That really couldn’t have been plainer. Aleaked documentfrom Marco Rubio to US diplomats, late last year, parroted related white supremacist talking points: migration as a threat to social cohesion and public safety, and its association with violent crime.They have been building an ideological carte blanche to intervene in progressive nations for their own good, the way you’d take a box of matches off a child. Which may be all just talk, but Trump’s talk is so unrestrained, and its wildest excesses so often followed up with action, that at some point we need to come to terms with a fact about this administration: just because it barks, constantly, doesn’t mean its bite won’t be worse.Just as European leaders braced for the unthinkable, military action against a fellow Nato member, Rubio said the rhetoric had all just been to soften up Denmark up for a retail offer: relax everyone, Trump justwants to buy Greenland. His realtor’s logic, which we’ve seen before in despicable remarks about adevastated Gaza, should concern the UK more than anything: he’s already spent two decades buying a chunk of Scotland. His ancestral links, coupled with his golfing ambition, have made Aberdeenshire the petri dish of his identity, as a neighbour, ally, businessman and statesman. When Trump buys a country or part thereof, he makes investment promises he doesn’t keep, he alienates and bullies everyone in the vicinity, he wreaks environmental havoc, he blocks renewables or at least tries to, and he creates aplayground for the super-rich.The organising principles here are domination and expansion. Any leader who thinks they could make their peace with Trump owning Greenland should swap in Scotland and wonder how peaceful they would feel about that.Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionGreenlandScotlandDenmarkTrump administrationMarco RubioEuropecommentShareReuse this content"

Together with the national security strategy published in December, the move on Venezuela can be understood as advancing a vision for carving up the world into what the Nazi jurist Carl Schmitt called “great spaces”, with each in effect supervised by a great power (meaning, in today’s world, Washington, Moscow and Beijing). But more is happening than a return to such de facto imperialism: Trump’s promise to “run the country” for the sake of US oil companies signals the internationalization of one aspect of his regime – what has rightly been called the logic of the mafia state. That logic is even more obvious in his stateddesire to grab Greenland.The theory of themafia statewas first elaborated by the Hungarian sociologist Bálint Magyar in 2016. Such a state is less about corruption where envelopes change hands under the table. Instead, public procurement is rigged; large companies are brought under the control of regime-friendly oligarchs, who in turn acquire media to provide favorable coverage to the ruler. The beneficiaries are what Magyar calls the “extended political family” (which can include the ruler’s natural family). As with the mafia, unconditional loyalty is the price for being part of the system.As so often with Trump 2.0, practices that other regimes try to veil have been unashamedly in the open: the “pausing” of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act signaled that the US is not only open for business but also bribing (be it with a jet or a fake prize from Fifa); not only do pardons appear to be for sale; and not only can companies curry favor by financing a grotesque ballroom – but also the president’s political family, which includes billionaires like Steve Witkoff and HowardLutnick, seems poised to profit handsomely, including fromforeign deals, and now foreign military adventures; according to the investigative reporterJudd Legum, the Trump oligarch Paul Singer (owner of the oil company Citgo), is to set to dovery wellwith a Trump-controlled government in Caracas.This does not mean that the US’s “special military operation” in Venezuela is entirely a matter of “it’s the oil, stupid”; there is an argument that it helps push back against Iran, China and Russia (even if the precedent thatkilling 40 peopleand kidnapping sets alsolegitimizes interventionsby other powers, as those lamenting the weakening of international law have rightly pointed out). There is also the old-style neoconservative justification for removing a tyrant from power, something that the former self of Marco Rubio, before bending the knee, would have favored – though leaving a decapitated regime in place has made talk of democracy and human rights protection a tadimplausible. But the point is not regime change, as long as a regime is fine with Trumpian exploitation. The alternative is extortion: if the US oil companies get “total access”, the rulers ofwhat is also a mafia state of sortscan stay in place; if not, it’s a bigger boss talking to a minor boss along the lines of: “Nice country you have there; pity if we had to do a full-scale invasion.”What really gives the game away is the almost immediate follow-up chatter not just about Cuba, but about Greenland. Aboard Air Force One, Trump, Lutnick and Lindsey Graham had a good – in fact, obscene –laughabout the supposed inability of Denmark to provide security in the Arctic Circle; the joke that had the sycophants in stitches consisted of saying that Denmark was now providing one more dog sled for security (the reality is that Copenhagenrecently decided to send new naval vessels and surveillance drones– though an importantelite dog-sled patroldoes actually exist). In any case, the US has long had a base in Greenland and in many ways used the territory as it saw fit: despite a Danish policy against nuclear weapons, during the cold war, the US started flying nuclear-armed B-52s over Greenland, and they did so, it turned out, with the tacit consent of the Danish government (some footage of Dr Strangelove was filmed over Greenland). What Danish politicians are only slowly realizing is that the main issue isn’t national security, but the Trumpian euphemism of “economic security”.Greenland holds critical minerals; but it also provides a seemingly blank slate for the kinds of settler colonial fantasies that another set of Trump allies, the tech bros, have long been cultivating:charter cities, “network states” or even “seasteading”, based on a combination of libertarian ideology and limitless AI experiments. A company called Praxis – with funds from Peter Thiel – has been pursuing the idea of starting new countries with cryptocurrency; one of its founders, Dryden Brown,went on recordclaiming that “Praxis would like to support Greenland’s development by coordinating talent, companies, and capital to help secure the Arctic, extract critical resources, terraform the land with advanced technology to make it more habitable, and build a mythical city in the North”.Again, as with Latin America, there is a larger background story that matters: Pat Buchanan, the 1992 presidential candidate, already had his eyes on Greenland; plus, there is the fact that the current president is attracted to – how to put this politely – strong visuals; he once observed: “I love maps. And I always said: ‘Look at the size of this … That should be part of the United States.’” But the logic of extraction (if, necessary, preceded by extradition to a US court), exploitation and, if necessary, extortion is what most seems to be animating the quest for what one sycophant in Congress has claimed should be re-named “Red, White, and Blueland”.Jan-Werner Müller is a Guardian US columnist and a professor of politics at Princeton UniversityExplore more on these topicsTrump administrationOpinionDonald TrumpGreenlandDenmarkUS foreign policyEuropeUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

Here’s howColin SeebergerDemocrats should go on the offense against Republicans, but they should also lay out a vision for renewing the promise of a middle-class lifeWed 7 Jan 2026 07.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 7 Jan 2026 07.35 ESTShareBy January 2029,Donald Trumpwill be capping off a nearly 14-year stretch at the helm of American politics. While he will no longer serve as president of the United States, his shadow over the future of American politics will continue to loom large across both sides of the aisle. Following Trump’s popular-vote victory in the 2024 election, the Democratic party has been forced to wrestle with what went wrong and how they can regain the support of an American majority to win back the White House. To win back Americans’ trust, Democrats have to prioritize affordability, broaden their cultural appeal, and reconnect with disaffected voters beyond their base.Trump’s political success has long been defined by his willingness to take on elite institutions and buck convention, putting distance between himself and weaknesses in the Republican brand while simultaneously undermining advantages in the Democratic brand. He’s ignored the wrath of editorial boards and economists while offering policy ideas and messaging that speaks to what voters think.In 2028,Democratsshould prioritize what voters – all of them – say they want over what’s pleasing to leftwing media, interest groups, donors and elites. Not only would this allow the Democratic party to put forward a policy agenda well-positioned to gain popular support – it would simultaneously help solve brand weaknesses, including criticisms that the party’s leaders lack strength, are too quick to dismiss voters’ concerns, or prioritize telling voters how to feel instead of listening to their concerns.Speaking of voters’ concerns – if the public has sent one unified message to our elected leaders over the last few years, it’s that the cost of living is unaffordable. The good news for Democrats is that Trump and the Republican party have failed to deliver on their promises to lower prices. Instead, they’ve coalesced behind an agenda that makes life less affordable for everyday Americans.The president’s tariffs are increasing prices of everyday goods, includinggroceries,clothing, andappliances. This pain is compounded by Trump’s marquee megabill, whichleaves many Americans worse offwhile giving the top 1% of earners $1tn in tax breaks. The bill’s unprecedented cuts to Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (Snap), termination of key tax credits, and massive increase in the federal debt will spike the costs of housing, healthcare, food, gas, and utilities for countless Americans.Democrats should go on the offense againstRepublicansworking to make life more expensive, but they should also lay out a vision for renewing the promise of a middle-class life and the political reforms that will be necessary to deliver on such change.As important as they are, popular and effective policies that address the American people’s problems aren’t a magic bullet for electoral success, especially whenmore than one-thirdof Americans identify as news avoiders. Of those who do consume news, 40% report being “primarily digital media consumers”, meaning they get their information from non-traditional sources, like podcasts, YouTube shows, and content creators.Reaching these Americans requires Democratic candidates to build an identity that extends beyond politics. That will necessitate tapping into the cultural conversations people are already having – not avoiding hard topics or creating an echo chamber to only talk to the Americans who already agree with you. Beyond the substance and need to penetrate the non-traditional media ecosystem, Democrats also need to optimize their owned social media channels for style to more authentically connect with the electorate. Publishingdirect-to-camera videos, for instance, have proven to be an effective tactic.If Democrats are willing to have conversations that breach their comfort zones and are willing to level with the public about how the party has fallen, they may find a sympathetic ear in those being devastated by the agenda Trump and Republicans in Congress have delivered on. And with Trump’s heir apparent – JD Vance, having cast the deciding vote for $1tn in cuts to Medicaid, cuts which he described as “immaterial” even as they will devastate rural hospitals and cause millions to lose coverage – running away from that record will prove impossible. It’s created a real opportunity for Democrats to make inroads in crucial swing states like North Carolina, wheremore than half a million peopleare poised to lose their health coverage, and Georgia, where the repeal of clean energy investments could costnearly 40,000 jobs, many in Republican districts.Democrats face a difficult, but achievable, task in winning back the White House in 2028. It will require them to be relentless in addressing America’s affordability crisis, reaching out beyond the Democratic base, and persuading voters that Republicans have failed to drive changes that materially improve their lives – and that Democrats have meaningful solutions and the strength to deliver on them.Colin Seeberger is a senior adviser for communications at the Center for American ProgressExplore more on these topicsDemocratsOpinionDonald TrumpTrump administrationRepublicansUS politicsJD VancecommentShareReuse this content"

Satellite-based radar, solar-powered drones, robot submarines and lab-based ‘artificial glaciers’ could all play a roleWed 7 Jan 2026 06.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 7 Jan 2026 12.30 ESTShareSea levels are rising faster than at any point in human history, and for every foot that waters rise, 100 million people lose their homes. At current projections, that means about 300 million people will be forced to move in the decades to come, along with the social and political conflict as people migrate inland. Despite this looming crisis, the world still lacks specific, reliable forecasts for when and where the seas will rise – and we have invested almost nothing in understanding whether and how we can slow it down.Societies must continue to focus on reducing greenhouse gas emissions, but it’s increasingly clear that the world needs to do more: we need to predict the future of the world’s ice with precision, and to explore safe, science-backed methods to keep it from melting away.What does that look like? A growing group of scientists at universities and non-profits are testing a new approach, one that treats ice not as a distant, untouchable force, but as a system we can understand, anticipate and conserve.The challenge is vast. The largest drivers of sea-level rise are ocean-bound glaciers whose loss is largely driven by warm ocean currents melting their undersides, a deep ocean process that will continue even as we reduce emissions. Like enormous ice cubes dumped into a glass of water, collapsing glaciers can raise sea levels precipitously.We can safely experiment on reflecting sunlight away from Earth. Here’s how | Dakota Gruener and Daniele VisioniRead moreMost concerning is the Florida-sized Thwaites glacier in west Antarctica, called the “doomsday glacier” because it is the keystone holding back the much larger west Antarctic ice sheet. If, as satellite observations indicate, Thwaites continues to collapse, the west Antarctic ice sheet would go with it, raising global sea levels more than 6ft, displacing more than half a billion people, in our children’s lifetimes. Notably, while we believe reducing carbon emissions is critical for climate resilience, even bringing emissions to preindustrial levels will not slow this collapse.This scenario is daunting, but we are not powerless. The way we see it, there has never been a better time to meet this challenge head-on. We are the beneficiaries of decades of polar and glacier research strengthened by innovative technologies that allow us to monitor the ice sheets, study relevant phenomena in the laboratory and combine this knowledge in computational models to forecast sea-level rise.Technologies we can bring to bear include satellite-based radar, solar-powered drones, robot submarines, lab-based “artificial glaciers” and advanced computing technologies, including artificial intelligence.What might be possible in the future to prevent sea-level rise?Glaciers, which flow like rivers of ice over a bed of rock and sediment, can naturally freeze themselves to their beds under the right conditions, as the Kamb ice stream in west Antarctica did about 200 years ago. This freezing occurred in only a few relatively small areas under Kamb, and yet the entire glacier has virtually stopped flowing and is currently accumulating ice.We cannot afford to debate until the tide is at our doorImportantly, this freezing-induced stabilization, which has lasted for centuries, did not affect the stability of surrounding areas, suggesting there are nature-inspired solutions that could stabilize Thwaites, and other areas, at reasonable cost and risk, especially compared with the astronomical costs and existential risks of unchecked sea-level rise. One approach that shows promise would involve drilling to the bed of Thwaites and installing passive heat pumps, known as thermosiphons, to cool its base.These are only ideas at this stage. It will take years of research and development to understand if and how we might stabilize ice sheets. Such efforts will need to consider the views of multiple governing bodies and stakeholders and follow established engineering frameworks, including Nasa’s Technology Readiness Level (TRL) system, which assesses viability throughout a deliberative development process. Innovation and speed are of the essence because of the human and economic toll of sea-level rise, but so too are scientific discipline and environmental responsibility.We cannot “move fast and break things” – but we also cannot afford to debate until the tide is at our door.Philanthropy is currently picking up where governments have failed to fund at scale. For example, the recently concluded International Thwaites Glacier Collaboration (ITGC), a partnership between the US and the UK, provided on average about US$7m each year from 2018 to 2025. That is considered a major investment in this field, yet it is vanishingly small next to the hundreds of billions lost to coastal flooding every year. Accelerating preparations for sea level rise requires greater and sustained funding commitments.As scientists who have studied ice sheets and glaciers for years, we were resigned to documenting their demise. But we’ve decided to embrace a more proactive approach to this problem, which means applying our knowledge and skills to rapidly improve sea-level forecasts, so we all know what’s coming and when, and, in parallel, to research and develop solutions that could slow rates of sea-level rise.All of us must face the fact that sea levels will continue to rise, with major implications for ourselves, our children and our grandchildren. However, facing that reality is not the same as accepting it. We must start now to combine emissions reduction with careful, responsible exploration of new options to slow sea-level rise and prevent worst-case scenarios.If we fail to find new options, we will at least know that we did everything we could, while helping humanity prepare for what’s coming. And if we succeed, we will have done something once thought out of reach: we’ll have preserved the world’s coastlines, and given future generations the chance to live by stable seas.Dr Brent Minchew is the co-founder and chief scientist at the Arête Glacier Initiative and a professor of geophysics at CaltechDr Colin Meyer is the co-founder and deputy scientist at the Arête Glacier Initiative and an associate professor of engineering at Dartmouth CollegeExplore more on these topicsGeoengineeringIt's time to talk about geoengineeringSea levelGlaciersClimate crisisPolar regionsOceanscommentShareReuse this content"

For the past few months, the rapper and former gay icon has been horrifying many of her fans by cosying up to the Trump administration.In November, for example,Minaj shared a post byDonald Trump about the treatment of Christians in Nigeria and agreed to collaborate with the administration on awareness around the issue. Then, in December, the rapper made a surprise appearance at Turning Point USA’s AmericaFest convention, where sheheaped praiseon the late Charlie Kirk (who oncesaid Minajwas not a good role model for “18-year-old Black girls”) and the vice-president, JD Vance. She also accidentally called Vance an “assassin” while talking to Erika Kirk, Charlie’s widow, but was quickly forgiven for her word choice. “I love this woman,” Erika Kirk proclaimed after the weird gaffe.Not everyone shares that love.Two onlinepetitionsto have Minaj deported now have more than 120,000 signatures. Minaj came to the US from Trinidad and Tobago as an undocumented child and has beenoutspokenabout Trump’s hardline immigration policies. She even once rapped about them: “Island girl, Donald Trump want me go home,” she sang in 2016. Perhaps she is reckoning that now she has got a green card, and is being broadly pro-Trump, the president is not going to send her home, no matter how many petitions go viral.I suppose I could jump on a high horse and talk about how awful it is that some apparent progressives are trying to weaponise Trump’s dystopian immigration policies against Minaj now that’s she’s gone all Maga. But, honestly, who has the energy for that? There is a lot more to be outraged about than people wanting to deport an annoying pop star.What has happened to the rapper’s own moral outrage, though, I have to wonder. Minaj once seemedgenuinely upsetabout Trump’s family separation policies. Has she really been Maga-fied or is something else going on? One conspiracy theory doing the rounds online is that Minaj might want the president to pardon her husband, Kenneth Petty (a registered sex offender), and brother (achild rapist). We all know Trump loves pardoning terrible people but he can’t erasestate convictions, so this theory seems unlikely.Or has Minaj figured out that, if you play your cards right, getting “cancelled” by progressives and joining Team Trump is a lucrative career move? She may have lost some fans, but give it a few months and she’ll be the new head of the FBI, president of Venezuela or queen of Greenland.Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

His refusal to choose leaves vital choices for Britain to be made by othersWed 7 Jan 2026 01.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 7 Jan 2026 09.01 ESTShareFor an inveterate liar, Donald Trump is remarkably honest. The best guide to what he thinks is what he says. When forecasting his likely course of action, start with his declared intentions –removing the president of Venezuela, for example – and assume he means it. When he says the USmust take possession of Greenland, he is not kidding.The motives are sometimes muddled but rarely hidden. Trump likes making deals, especially real estate deals, and money. He wants to be great and to have his greatnessaffirmed with praise and prizes. He craves spectacle. The world as he describes it doesn’t always resemble observable reality, but there is an effortless, sociopathic sincerity to his falsehoods. The truth is whatever he intuits it to be in the moment to advance his interests and manipulate his audience.Trump’s freewheeling brazenness lies at the extreme end of a spectrum where the opposite pole is Keir Starmer’s verbal constipation on camera. It isn’t the most profound difference between the two men, but the contrast reveals something significant about the prime minister’s present difficulties.It isn’t just adeficit of telegenic panache. Saying whatever comes to mind is a privilege of unaccountable power. Trump doesn’t have to care about the consequences of his words. Minding your language for fear of offending a vindictive despot is a habit well known to subjects of authoritarian rule. It has now become the diplomatic mode of the US’s former allies.Trump’s new world order is being born – and Venezuela is just the start | Owen JonesRead moreIt took Downing Street16 hours to commenton the US seizure of Nicolás Maduro from Caracas. The position, once revealed, straddled the gulf between the government’s stated commitment to international law and its undeclared policy of never impugning Trump. Ministers have held that pose now for days. The strain is showing.Given Starmer’s background as a human rights lawyer, he surely has a view on whether governments can legitimately abduct foreign heads of state, regardless of whether they are vicious dictators. It is also part of the normal diplomatic process that he keeps that view private when formulating the official response to the actions of a country on which Britain depends for its security.Trump’s actions in Venezuela, as in so many other areas, invite condemnation on points of principle. But the prime minister has to consider scenarios for the day after condemnation, and the days after that. He looks at his diary and sees a “coalition of the willing” meetingin Paris with fellow European governments that are committed to the defence of Ukraine. Trump’s negotiatorsare attending. At stake is the scope of anyfuture security guaranteesfor Kyiv.Maybe the Americans wouldn’t notice if the UK prime minister had spent the previous 48 hours denouncing their foreign policy with high-minded rhetoric to satisfy backbench Labour MPs. Maybe they wouldn’t care. But maybe they would. Maybe they would insist on a grovelling retraction as the entrance fee back into Trump’s favour.What would Ukrainians under Russian bombardment want Starmer to do? Perhaps they would see the unequivocal assertion of international law regardingVenezuelaas a requirement of moral consistency to reinforce the case against Vladimir Putin for violating their own sovereignty. Or perhaps they would prefer that their European friends simply do whatever it takes to prevent Trump bullying Volodymyr Zelenskyy into accepting Kremlin terms.People can reasonably disagree on whether Starmer has got this choice right. But no one who demands a different course has to weigh the cost of getting it wrong, of saying the wrong thing, as seriously as the prime minister. Saying nothing would obviously be his preference. That option isn’t open when massive international events require a response. So Downing Street does the next best thing, drafting a script that comes as close to saying nothing as words will allow.The defence of this approach is that Starmer’s relations with Trump are better than anyone might have anticipated given their differences of temperament and ideological provenance, and that the national interest is thus served.The evidence is mixed. On the economic front, Britain hasn’t exactly enjoyed leniency under the new US tariff regime, but nor has it been singled out for exceptional punishment. Progress on a “tech prosperity deal”, notionally agreed last September,has stalled. Maga ideologues talk about London as patient zero in a Europe-wide plague of civilisational collapse, spread by non-white immigrants and treatable only by far-right insurrection.With Ukraine, the picture is less bleak. Starmer has played a lead part in the orchestrated campaign by Nato leaders to charm Trump into a more amenable attitude to the alliance and a more sceptical view of Putin. The White House still regularly pings back to indulgence of the Kremlin, but Trump has been successfully persuaded that Europeis now paying for the war. The scorn he once showed for Zelenskyy was closely tied to his horror of the US being ripped off. Neutralising that fear has discernibly curbed his eagerness to throw Ukraine under a Russian tank.If the best that can be said of Europeans coddling Trump is that they are merely postponing the day when the US cuts them adrift, well, that is not a negligible achievement. There could bemerit in flatteryif it delays a US decision to blow up Nato by annexing Danish territory, perhaps even putting it off to the point where a less volatile president sits in the White House. It all depends on how profitably the extra time is spent.And that is where Starmer’s caginess gives the most cause for alarm. There is a valid tactical rationale for the prime minister’s reluctance to criticise the US right now, but it has to serve a strategic recognition that Britain’s future lies with Europe. There is not much evidence that this is the plan. Starmer talks up thevalue of closer economic ties to the EU, but in vague terms and always with the caveat that nothing agreed in Brussels should compromise relations with Washington.If, behind the scenes, Starmer does actually grasp the epic character of the changes that Trump’s presidency is wreaking on the world order, and the way that combines with Brexit to put Britain in a vulnerable position, he is doing a great job of pretending otherwise. Few of his foreign policy positions are asserted so confidently as the denial of any geopolitical dilemma. “I am never going to choose between the US and Europe,” hesaid in an interview last week.He seems to think he can rehabilitate Britain’s late 20th-century role as an Atlantic bridge at the centre of the western alliance. But Trump burns bridges. A highly globalised world is disaggregating into regional and continental blocs. Even with a different US president, the old norms will not spontaneously reassert themselves. Starmer’s determination never to choose amounts to acceptance that vital choices for Britain will be made by others.This quiet inertia is more dangerous than refusal to moralise about illegal escapades in Latin America. There is a realpolitik justification for not calling out Trump’s military gangsterism, but it is also an argument for getting out of the White House protection racket as quickly as possible. The problem with Starmer’s reticence is that, in the context of everything else he says and does, it is indistinguishable from paralysis by indecision. A case could be made for a pragmatic prime minister who sometimes prefers not to speak his mind. But it relies on the audience believing he has something serious in mind that isn’t being spoken.Rafael Behr is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsKeir StarmerOpinionDonald TrumpTrump administrationVenezuelaEuropean UnionUkraineUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

But while the November inflation figuresreleased on Wednesdaywere lower than expected, it is unlikely to do much to affect the outlook for interest rates.One of the impacts of having more of something is that each individual piece is less valuable, and so it is with inflation stats. Last year the Bureau of Statistics moved from putting out the official consumer price index figures every quarter to every month. And while that does provide us with more information, it means that each release is given less importance than used to be the case when we had to wait three months for each one.In November, annual inflation was 3.4%, down from 3.8% in October. This was lower than expected but not by enough to really affect the likelihood of what the RBA will do in the first week of February.The good news is that the October figures do seem to be a bit of an outlier, with both the CPI and the trimmed mean (which strips out the biggest rises and falls to get an “underlying” figure”) falling in November:But these new monthly figures are rather erratic. In November, prices on average did not actually change (ie any rises were cancelled by price falls). And if you wonder then why annual inflation fell, it is because in November 2024, prices rose by 0.4%, so the 0% change in price in November 2025 means the annual inflation fell:So what has been the biggest cause of price rises over the past year?This is where it gets a tad complicated because it really depends on where you live (and always remember CPI figures only count prices in capital cities, so if you live in Wagga Wagga, Ballarat, Cairns or any rural area, your prices are not counted).Across the cities, Brisbane has the biggest jump. Rather than a 3.4% increase in prices, Brisbane residents saw inflation in the past year rise 5.1%, while in Perth it was just 2.8%:What is going on?Across the entire country the two biggest drivers of inflation were electricity prices and rents. Those two accounted for 20% of all inflation over the past year in Australia (if you ignore tobacco prices, which, given the amount of illegal cigarette sales, it’s best to do).But that contribution was not uniform. In Brisbane, electricity prices alone accounted for a third of all inflation, while in Perth, it contributed to inflation being 25% lower than it otherwise would have been:The reason is the timing ofelectricity rebates.In Brisbane, electricity prices in November were 456% higher than they were a year earlier, while in Perth they were 29% lower. The reason was not the different sources of electricity in either state, but the timing of electricity rebates in those states starting and finishing.Remember that annual inflation is the change in inflation from one month to that same month the year before. So if in November 2024 a state had an electricity rebate and in November 2025 it did not (or vice versa) then it looks like prices have either drastically increased or fallen. This is what happened in Brisbane and Perth:Another concern for the Bureau of Statistics is the impact of theBlack Friday salesin November. These are a relatively new thing for Australia and thus could be expected to throw a spanner into the figures. But the ABS found that mostly it was a wash – the price drops in major Black Friday categories in November last year were much the same as was the case in November 2024. This meant there was no real impact on the annual figure overall:The figures however do make it clear January is a good one to find bargains for clothes and furniture, but not so much footwear, or accessories. And we probably should wait till March to buy appliances. Although as ever, these are averages, so don’t take this as financial or shopping advice!The stats don’t lie. Australia’s tax system is designed to benefit the wealthiest and the rest of us pay for it | Greg JerichoRead moreAlas, while the overall level of 3.4% is less than expected, because of the erratic impacts of the electricity rebates, these figures are unlikely to produce any mortgage interest rate bargains.The RBA will not find any reason in these figures to cut rates next month, but the lower-than-expected rate should at least prevent them increasing them. That however could all change in a few weeks, when usually we get another CPI release. That one on 28 February will cover both the month of December and the December quarter. The RBA has made it clear for the moment they will focus more on the quarterly figures, and as a result that will be the one all investors, homeowners, and federal treasurers will be looking forward to with hot anticipation.Greg Jericho is a Guardian columnist and chief economist at The Australia InstituteExplore more on these topicsAustralian economyGrogonomicsReserve Bank of AustraliacommentShareReuse this content"

Let it herald a new and exciting ambitionWed 7 Jan 2026 06.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 7 Jan 2026 12.31 ESTShareGood things may come to those who wait, but when it comes to repairing theBrexitsettlement Britain was left with by Boris Johnson, the waiting has come at a heavy cost. Prices are higher, trade is weaker and our influence diminished. That is why Keir Starmer’s promise to bring forward legislation this year to improve the UK’s deal with the EU is the clearest signal yet that the era of warm words without delivery may finally be coming to an end.Since the fanfare of lastMay’s UK-EU summit, progress has been glacial. The commitments trailed at the time were not abstract diplomatic wins but practical fixes people could feel. A deal on food standards and animal welfare, known as anSPS agreement, could ease pressure on supermarket prices. An energy trading agreement could lower bills by allowing the UK and EU to cooperate more efficiently in increasingly volatile markets. Yet months later, neither is in place.Much of the delay is not Downing Street’s fault. Negotiations require both sides to move, and the EU is not known for its haste. It must balance the interests of 27 member states and proceed carefully. But caution is no excuse for inertia, especially when the economic damage of the status quo is so clear.That is why reports that the government is preparing the legislative groundwork to deliver on SPS and energy cooperation are significant. Nearly three years after these proposals were first set out by the cross-partyUK Trade and Business Commission, this bill is the first concrete sign that implementation is finally within reach. Still, food and energy agreements alone will not be enough to define success at this year’s UK-EU summit.Britain’s return to Erasmus+in 2027 is welcome, but insufficient. Young people are still waiting for a youth experience scheme that would restore opportunities to live, work and study across Europe. More urgent still is the question of UK access toSafe, the EU’s €150bn rearmament fund. At a moment when brave Ukrainian men and women stand between us and the tyrant on our doorstep, and Donald Trump openly questions US commitment to European security, it is absurd that the UK and EU have yet to reach agreement on cooperating more closely on defence investment.Securing clear agreements and timelines on food, energy, youth mobility and defence cooperation would mark a successful end to what might be called phase one of Labour’s post-Brexit reset. But Starmer has hinted that he is thinking beyond that. In dismissing renewed calls for a customs union, he suggested that while helpful, it would not be transformative enough.The evidence backs him up. A customs union alone would deliver very modest gains while riling opponents. If Starmer is going to face down the inevitable accusations of Brexit betrayal, he should do so in pursuit of changes that genuinely move the dial on growth and living standards.That means phase two of the reset must focus on deeper, broader alignment across the economy. Mutual recognition of standards across all industrial sectors, mutual recognition of professional qualifications and UK accession to thepan-Euro-Mediterranean conventioncould boost GDP growth by about 2%, according toBest for Britain researchby Frontier Economics. These proposals are hardly radical. We’ve been pushing for them since 2023, and all sit comfortably within Labour’s stated red lines of no return to the single market, the customs union or freedom of movement.There is also a powerful regional case for this approach. Frontier’s analysis suggests that the biggest gains from closer UK-EU alignment on all goods and services would be felt outside London and the south-east, particularly in the Midlands, Yorkshire and the north-east. Whereas the Conservative government spoke in hollow terms about levelling up, this is an opportunity for the current government to deliver something real.Even larger GDP boons would of course come from breaching the red lines to pursue single market access, though leaving the UK a “rule taker”, and more still from joining the EU once again as a “rule maker”.Of course, any form of closer cooperation comes at a price. Like Switzerland, the UK would have to pay to participate and accept shared rules in agreed areas. This is a debate Starmer should welcome. When critics complain about cost, the PM can point to the reality of the past decade. Eurosceptics once railed against the UK’s annual EU membership contribution, yet Brexit has wiped about£90bn a year from the public finances, according to the House of Commons Library. Meanwhile, Trump’s embrace of tariffs has shown how isolation leaves Britain more exposed, not more independent.Some will argue that Brussels will never agree to such an arrangement with a large neighbouring economy. We have heard that refrain before. They’re the same voices that told us none of the measures now being prepared for in legislation were possible either. The truth is that the UK and EU share economic, security and geopolitical interests. Closer cooperation is not just possible, it’s an urgent necessity.Naomi Smith is CEO of Best for BritainExplore more on these topicsEuropean UnionOpinionBrexitForeign policyEuropecommentShareReuse this content"

Yet with astonishing cruelty, ministers refuse to listen to their reasonable demandsWed 7 Jan 2026 03.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 7 Jan 2026 07.55 ESTShareThey are far into the lethal zone. Three people who are being held in prison on charges connected with the protest group Palestine Actionhave been on hunger strike for 45, 59 and 66 days. A fourth prisoner,Teuta Hoxha, ended her strikethis week, after 58 days.She could suffer lifelong health effects. The remaining strikers, Heba Muraisi, Kamran Ahmed and Lewie Chiaramello,could pass away at any time. The 10 IRA and INLA hunger strikers who died in 1981 survived for between 46 and 73 days. Muraisi, whose strike has lasted the longest, is, according to supporters,now struggling to breatheand suffering uncontrollable muscle spasms – possible signs of neurological damage. Yet the government refuses to engage.It created this situation.The Crown Prosecution Servicestates that the maximum time a prisoner can spend on remand is 182 days (six months). Yet Muraisi and Ahmed were arrested in November 2024, and are not due to be tried until June at the earliest, which means they will be remanded for 20 months. Chiaramello, who was arrested in July 2025, has a provisional court date in January 2027, which means 18 months in prison without trial.The limbo of remand is often devastating to prisoners’ wellbeing.Government figures, for example, show that the rate of suicide among remanded prisoners is more than twice that among sentenced prisoners. Extreme periods of remand like these are an offence against justice.This is one aspect of what campaigners call “process as punishment”, an approach that now dominates the treatment of protest groups. Even if you are never convicted of a crime, your life is made hell if you dare, visibly and publicly, to dissent.The three prisoners, and others charged with the same offences, are being held under “terrorist conditions”. This means they are allowed only minimal communications and visits. They’ve also beenbanned from prison jobsfor “security reasons”, denied books, newspapers, library and gym visits and subjected to “non-association orders”. In October,Muraisi was suddenly transferredfrom HMP Bronzefield, 18 miles from London, where her family lives, to New Hall prison in Yorkshire, which is too far away for her sick mother to visit. After she had been moved, she was told it was because of the risk of association with another prisoner on the same wing at Bronzefield.Yet none of the hunger strikers has been charged with, let alone sentenced for, terrorist offences. They have been charged with ordinary criminal offences, such as burglary, criminal damage and violent disorder. Muraisi and Ahmed are alleged to have broken into a factory run by Elbit Systems, Israel’s largest weapons manufacturer, and damaged equipment, while Chiaramello is alleged to have entered RAF Brize Norton during a protest in which Palestine Action sprayed warplanes with paint. These events took place before Palestine Action was proscribed as a terrorist group, ahighly controversial decisionthat is being challenged in court: the decision is expected very soon. But never mind the presumption of innocence, never mind the presumption against retrospective application of the law: because the CPS says there is a “terrorism connection”, they’re being treated as if they were convicted terrorists.On 26 December, a group of United Nations rapporteurs – the kind of people who, in days gone by, were heeded by governments –expressed grave concernabout the treatment of these prisoners, which, they said, included “reported delays in accessing medical care, use of excessive restraint during hospital treatment, denial of contact with family members and legal counsel, and lack of consistent independent medical oversight, particularly for detainees with serious pre-existing health conditions”. They had “serious questions” about our government’s compliance with international human rights law, “including obligations to protect life and prevent cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment”. But once you’ve labelled someone a terrorist, it seems, you can do almost anything to them and get away with it. The silence on this issue across almost all the media is something to behold.The government bears moral responsibility for these prisoners. Yet it appears to have no intention of exercising it. Lawyers, MPs and doctors have repeatedly beseeched ministers to engage with the issue.They flatly refuse, claiming that to do so would be to “create perverse incentives that would encourage more people to put themselves at risk through hunger strikes”. There is no evidence for this, and given the extremely unusual nature of this action (it is the biggestcoordinated, sustained hunger strikeby prisoners since the IRA’s in 1981), itseems highly unlikely.The government hassought to create the impressionthat such events are common – “over the last five years we have averaged over 200 hunger strike incidents every year” – so no unusual response is required. But what it appears to be referring to is brief refusals of food by individual prisoners, a completely different situation from animminent risk of death by starvation.More than 100 medical professionals signeda letterto the justice secretary, David Lammy, on 27 November warning that prisoners face a “medical emergency”, which “is being managed incorrectly”. Afurther letteron 17 December was signed by more than 800 medical and legal experts and others. The government has yet to respond to either.Instead, it appears to mock the hunger strikers’ predicament. When Jeremy Corbyn MPasked the justice minister Jake Richards, in parliament, whether he would meet their legal representatives to try to resolve the situation, Richards answered with a sharp “No”,prompting laughter in the chamber. In December, the speaker of the Commons remarked that Lammy’s failure to respond to the MPs asking for a meeting about the issue was “totally unacceptable”. But the failure continues.The hunger strikers’ demands seem reasonable to me: release on bail; the right to a fair trial (they claim the government has withheld key documents); lifting the ban on Palestine Action; and shutting down Elbit Systems – which has supplied weapons to a state engaged in genocide – in the UK. All these things, I believe, should be happening anyway. And they are of course negotiating positions. Whether all would need to be met for the strike to end cannot be known until the government engages. Its refusal to talk could condemn the strikers to death.It should not be necessary to risk your life to demand fair treatment and just decisions. But when everyone in power has stopped listening, there are few remaining options.George Monbiot is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Not because I doubt Rosalía’s virtuosic talents or her intense intellectual curiosity, but because the album’s promotional campaign had already done too much work on my nerves. The rollout was relentless:thirsty reelsteasing the album on social media, fashion-forward mysticism, even bringing Madrid’s city centreto a halt– everything about it felt designed to send the message that this is less a set of songs than a global event demanding reverence.Over the past decade, Rosalía has become Spain’s biggest pop export, and Lux appears to inaugurate her imperial phase. The album debuted at No 1 in five countries, was votedthe Guardian’s album of the year, broke streaming recordson Spotify, and reached No 4 in the US and UK charts, where non-anglophone pop rarely thrives. Multilingual and stylistically expansive, Lux is saturated with Catholic iconography, with lyrics in no fewer than 13 languages, and circling themes of transcendence, suffering and grace.None of this is unprecedented in pop music, but the album’s atmosphere of luxury, and framing of spiritual transcendence as a premium experience, sits poorly during a cost of living crisis, especially when the Vatican has been unusually direct recently in itscriticism of inequality, economic excess, and the moral alibis of wealth.“Why is she doing nun-corenow?” I grumbled, watching Rosalía iron her clothes in the video for first singleBerghain, flanked by an imposing chorus and orchestra. A revival of (conspicuously white) national-Catholic aesthetics seems like the last thing the world needs, especially laundered through someone with Rosalía’s reach. Her ascent has made her a one-woman soft-power campaign for Spanish culture, the undisputed sovereign ofla Marca España(Brand Spain, a government initiative) on the global pop stage.View image in fullscreenLux by Rosalía.Photograph: APAnd yet, once I spent time with the record, and the PR fog began to clear, it became obvious that Lux is doing something more interesting and unsettling than lavish ecclesiastical pop. Beneath the bombast and heavy-handed symbolism lies not a sermon but an inquiry into what it means to inhabit a world of unravelling assumptions.Crisis today is no longer just a temporary moment of exception, but an all-encompassing condition – a point driven home in 2022 when the Collins Dictionary named “permacrisis” its word of the year. Daily life is saturated with moral urgency, and our values are perpetually “under threat”. The cataloguing of plagues – genocide, war, climate breakdown, inflation, displacement – now feels less like diagnosis and more like content tagging for the almighty algorithm. It was precisely this convergence of uncertainty and moralising that sociologist Ronald Inglehart studied for decades. He argued that existential insecurity pushes societies toward authoritarianism: to the upholding of traditional power hierarchies, moral rigidity, religious sanctimony and the patriarchal social order.Spain is no exception. Over the past decade, a constellation of ultra-conservative actors has moved from the margins to the centre of public life, largely via digital tools. These groups operate as “moral entrepreneurs”: politically savvy and highly mobilised, they frame themselves as embattled defenders of life, order and truth against a hostile secular world. When I first loaded Rosalía’s Berghain video on YouTube, the advertisement before it played was from the Spanish bishops’ conference, titledYou too can be a saint– quietly confirming that sanctity, too, is now delivered algorithmically.These forces feed off a Spanish rage-bait cycle of high-levelcorruption scandalsand judicialpoliticisation. The buzzword here recently (as it is elsewhere) is “polarisation”, but the folk history behind it is that of the civil war betweenlasdos Españas(the two Spains): red versus black,NacionalesvRepublicanos, Cain v Abel. Rosalía, however, wants to elevate her gaze from such a binary worldview and study the whole in all its contradictions.View image in fullscreenRosalía makes a surprise appearance to promote her album, Lux, at Callao Square in Madrid on 20 October 2025.Photograph: Juanjo Martin/EPALux opens not with a declaration, but with a desire: to live between the two (“Quién pudiera vivir entre los dos”), loving both God and the Earth’s hedonic pleasures. It is far from an accident.Rosalíamust be one of very few global pop stars who conscientiously conducts scholarly research before songwriting: indeed her breakthrough 2018 album El Mal Querer doubled as her thesis at the Escola Superior de Música de Catalunya, and received academic honours. That intellectualism carries through to Lux. Doubling as an archive of female mystics, each song draws on figures such as Saint Teresa of Ávila, Rabia al-Adawiyya, Sun Bu’er or Hildegard von Bingen – women for whom devotion, authority, eroticism and transcendence were never neatly separable.Lux is exhilarating in its refusal to settle. Reliquia, the album’s globetrotting second track, twists spritely strings and vocal snippets into unrecognisable shapes before bursting into ecstatic rhythms. When Rosalía sings “No soy una santa, pero estoyblessed” (“I’m not a saint, but I am blessed”), the line lands with the deliberate thud of heretical subversion: divinisation without ascent. This is one of the “abominable heresies” for which the 17th-century philosopher Baruch Spinoza was excommunicated from both Judaism andCatholicism. Writing in the long shadow of the Inquisition that shaped his family’s forced conversion and exile, he proposed that God and nature are one and the same: that there is no hierarchy, no outside – only a single, endlessly differentiating “substance”.At its most compelling, Lux projects its dense religious themes on to a maximalist sonic palette, where the sacred is not opposed to the profane, but crowded with it. In Divinize, Rosalía finds liberation not through escape from the body but through deeper entanglement within it. On Porcelana, fragility, fear and ferocity drive a constantly evolving tension. “Ego sum nihil/ego sum lux mundi” (“I am nothing/I am the light of the world”) she sings in Latin, softly punctuated by simmering flamenco clapping – an alchemy as powerful as anything I’ve heard this year.These are the moments when Lux comes into focus, when easy dualities are gradually unpacked to reveal a multitude: not two opposed forces at opposite ends of a spectrum, but countless cohabiting ones in constant tension. This is evident in the album’s sprawling liner notes and production credits, Rosalía’s singular talents pushed forward through careful collaboration.It is not a perfect album: the more traditional pieces occasionally veer into excess or preciousness, and its avoidance of politics can feel less principled than insulated – at a moment when reactionary, inquisitorial projects are no longer marginal but enjoy direct access to power. Still, Lux gestures toward something more demanding than simple resolution: in the chorus of album highlight La Yugular, an all-encompassing love swells until it abolishes heaven and hell alike. The song ends with Rosalía collapsing scale again and again (“the entire galaxy fits in a drop of saliva”), to reveal the self as a site of both immensity and compression, where the strain of containing multitudes within a single body carries its own spiritual charge.Carlos Delclós is a sociologist and writer based in BarcelonaExplore more on these topicsRosalíaOpinionCatholicismChristianityReligionSpainEuropeLanguagecommentShareReuse this content"

Its director explains why she had to tell Hind’s tragic storyJulian BorgerWed 7 Jan 2026 11.09 ESTLast modified on Wed 7 Jan 2026 12.08 ESTShareWhen Kaouther Ben Hania heard Hind Rajab’s voice for the first time, she was in Los Angeles airport scrolling through social media. The five-year-old’s cry for help cut through the clamour around her. This was in February 2024 and Hind had already been dead for at least a week, left to bleed out among the corpses of six of her relatives after their car was targeted by an Israeli tank, leaving it with 335 bullet holes, according to theForensic Architecture research group.More than 20,000 Palestinian children were killed in two years of Israeli bombardment of Gaza, according to UN estimates. Another 82 have been killed since 10 October when a ceasefire was declared and then routinely breached. The pictures of the dead have often been published online, including those of Hind, showing her dressed in pink with a floral tiara, or smiling in an oversized academic cap and gown, but her voice also remains to haunt the world after her death.It premiered at Venice, receiving a 23-minute standing ovation – the longest in the festival’s historyThePalestineRed Crescent Society (PRCS) posted audio recordings of her last hours, made by the organisation’s emergency call centre via a mobile phone in the car, as Hind repeatedly, desperately, appealed for someone to rescue her. On the same recording, we can hear the increasingly fraught workers at the centre promising her that help would soon be on the way.When Ben Hania heard Hind’s voice, it brought her to an abrupt halt in the airport terminal, as travellers milled around her. This was a young child calling on adults to protect her amid the appeal of Palestine to be saved from genocide – and on both counts, the world had failed. “When I heard her voice, for that millisecond, it felt as if she was asking me to save her,” she says. “There was something very immediate in her voice, and it was very shocking.”View image in fullscreenIncreasingly fraught ... actors playing the four  Palestine Red Crescent workers who deal with Hind’s call.Photograph: Ent-movie/AlamyThe Tunisian director was between stops on a US tour promoting her latest film, having already begun work on her next. But she immediately cleared her calendar so she could start a new film based around Hind’s voice. “It was in my head for days and days,” says Ben Hania. “I felt a very strong sense of sadness and helplessness. I was wondering, ‘What can I do?’ The only thing I know how to do is make movies.”The outline of the film began to take shape as Ben Hania researched the circumstances of the recording. She found out that the clips the PRCS had put online were just fragments. They had recorded the whole call, lasting three hours, and they sent it all to Ben Hania. Listening to all of it, knowing how it would end, was “one of the most difficult things I’ve heard in my life”, she says.There was one last thing to be done before starting work – calling Hind’s mother, Wissam Hamada, who was in mourning in Gaza. “I told her, ‘I want to do a movie. Tell me if you don’t want me to and I won’t do it. And she told me, ‘I don’t want my daughter to be forgotten. I want justice for my daughter. So if this movie can help, do it please.’ So it started.”The result, called simply The Voice of Hind Rajab, is a dramatic recreation of the tragedy as it unfurled in the narrow confines of the Red Crescent call centre, with actors playing the roles of the four emergency workers who were on the other end of the line – but Hind’s voice is her own. The actors respond to the real voice, trying to encourage and console Hind as the emergency workers had done, recreating the agony of their ultimate failure.Many films contain images that cannot be unseen. The Voice of Hind Rajab cannot be unheard. Ben Hania succeeded in the task that Hamada entrusted her with, to make her daughter unforgettable. As Ben Hania puts it: “To honour her voice and make it echo.” Hind’s insistent cries for someone, anyone, to “come to get me” can never now be silenced. They summon up the unfathomable cruelty of Israel’s campaign in Gaza, and the collective failure of the rest of the world to stop the killing.View image in fullscreenHollywood backers … director Kaouther Ben Hania, right, with Joaquin Phoenix and Rooney Mara.Photograph: Elisabetta A Villa/Getty ImagesBen Hania, who is speaking to me during a recent visit to London, has situated the film somewhere in the borderland between drama and documentary where she has made her career. Her film studies thesis at the Sorbonne University in Paris explored that frontier. Her first film, Challatt Tunes (The Blade of Tunis), was a mockumentary about sexism and violence against women in Tunisia, and her later works have ranged from dramas loosely based on true stories to an intimate documentary about a young Tunisian girl exiled in Canada. “The frontier between the genres is something like the frontier between countries,” she says. “When you are walking, you don’t realise when you’ve entered another country.”Ben Hania’s filmFour Daughters, which she was promoting in early 2024 when she heard Hind’s voice, is about a Tunisian mother called Olfa Hamrouni who has four girls, two of whom have embraced radical Islam and left to join Islamic State. The film plays with the conventions of documentary and drama, intertwining them, so that the real Hamrouni and her two remaining daughters meet the actors who portray them as well the missing girls. The real family comment throughout on their emotions as they watch their drama unfurled before them.“Since I’m drawn to real stories, I always ask myself what is the best form to tell the story,” the 48-year-old says. “Film-making is about making choices – where to tell the story, how to tell it, in which way, in which form. And to make those choices, I always try to stay faithful to the first moment I encountered the story – what I felt. Because cinema is about emotion.”During the process of making The Voice of Hind Rajab, she kept going back to the first time she heard that voice and what she felt. “This sense of helplessness. I thought, ‘If I am feeling this, what was it like for the real people who were listening?’ What they felt is a condensation of what we are feeling – so many of us around the world – about what is happening in Gaza. This sense of helplessness. Nobody can reach her to help.”View image in fullscreenA rescue worker pinpoints Hind’s position in an image from the film.Photograph: Ent-movie/AlamyThe film acutely conveys the torment of the two men and two women who are in the emergency call centre. They know there is an ambulance in Gaza City just a few minutes away from Hind and ready to go. But the PRCS has to formally request, through intermediaries, the Israeli army’s permission to approach the area. That permission does not come for hours, as the wounded girl audibly begins to fade.Send the ambulance anyway, the younger man in the call centre demands, at the end of his tether. But his boss has seen too many ambulance workers die. Their pictures are up on his wall and he has pledged to resign if any more are killed on his watch. In the end, the green light finally comes, but Hind cannot be saved.Ben Hania realised she had managed to pierce, however fleetingly, the global impassivity towards slaughter in GazaEven though the audience knows how the story ends, it is still heartbreaking. It is easier to look away than to witness the killing of a child in harrowing detail. Ben Hania feared her film could simply fade into obscurity, a subtitled Arabic tale of something too hard to face. But at a critical moment, a group of Hollywood stars – including Brad Pitt, Joaquin Phoenix and Rooney Mara, together with directors Alfonso Cuarón and Jonathan Glazer – stepped in to back the project as executive producers.The film was picked by the Venice film festival where it premiered in September, receiving a23-minute standing ovation, the longest in the festival’s history. It could have gone on longer, but the cinema had to be cleared so the next movie could be shown. It was only at that moment that Ben Hania realised she had managed to pierce, however fleetingly, the global impassivity that has surrounded two years of slaughter in Gaza.“So many children have been killed that we are entering a zone of amnesia and insensitivity,” she says. “We’re numb, but cinema, literature and art can change things. At some point, you are done explaining. It is now about feeling what it is like to be in someone else’s shoes. That is another level – and cinema can do this.”The Voice of Hind Rajab is released in the UK on 16 JanuaryExplore more on these topicsFilmIsrael-Gaza warPalestineMiddle East and north AfricafeaturesShareReuse this content"

Lightbulb-changers on Clifton Suspension Bridge: Beezer’s best photograph‘I have outtakes of them all standing up – there’s no safety equipment and they’re not hanging on to anything. They just said to me, “Hurry up, Beez!”’Interview byChris BroughtonWed 7 Jan 2026 10.17 ESTLast modified on Wed 7 Jan 2026 12.08 ESTShareAt the age of 12 I was working for the Clash, handing out flyers. I looked older than I was and got to see all the punk bands before getting into reggae sound systems. MulticulturalBristolwas a great place to grow up, and by the time I was 14 or 15 I’d be going out late most nights and coming home mid-morning.Having failed the entrance exam to be a gas fitter, I enrolled on an audio-visual course – one of Thatcher’s newNational Training Initiatives. I specialised in photography and started documenting all those nights out – my friends and the scenes I was already part of – offering an insider’s perspective. Photography also gave me an opportunity to explore new environments. If there’s something you’re not sure about, a camera is a good way to have a look at it, be part of it, and then learn from it.I needed to do a little jump across. The cars below looked like matchboxes, the people like pinheadsAfter college, I got work as a stringer for NME, and also for a Bristol magazine called Venue. This picture was taken for a Venue editorial called Life on the Bridge. I went to get some shots of the Clifton Suspension Bridge and the toll keeper and so on, and on the day I was there a gang of maintenance guys happened to be on site to change the lightbulbs on top of the towers. They said: “Do you want to come up and take a shot of us?” Of course I said: “Yeah!”I had to climb up a ladder at the side of the bridge to the middle of one of the towers, then switch to another ladder. At the top, I needed to do a little jump across to the 150-year-old wooden floor inside the turret of the tower. The gap was only about half a metre, but below me the cars driving across the bridge looked like matchboxes and the people looked like pinheads. I was like: “Fucking hell!”One of the guys came up with me in case I had any problems, the rest started from the middle of the bridge and walked up the chain that held up the suspension cables. This was just before their lunch break, so they didn’t waste any time. I was still thinking about the fact that I’d overcome my vertigo to get up there and was trying to avoid looking down when suddenly there they were on the chain in front of me. I have outtakes of them all still standing up – there’s no safety equipment and they’re not hanging on to anything. Perhaps if the mayor or someone had been visiting they’d have worn harnesses, I don’t know. They just said: “Is this all right? Hurry up, Beez!”It’s 40 years since I took the picture, but it feels like it’s gone in a flash. Actually, I heard that one of those guys only retired last year. If someone asked me to go and shoot the same thing, in the same conditions, I’d probably do it but what with health and safety, a shot like that wouldn’t happen today. I don’t know if they even had any hard hats, no one was wearing one, and I don’t know if the picture caused them any trouble afterwards. But the trust who own the bridge have bought copies of it and I used to see it round Bristol, in restaurants and so on – it’s certainly one of my most popular shots.I’ve been described as a photographer and a historian, which is funny – the work ages, but I’m still around. I’m glad to have left my mark, but the volumes I’ve just brought out are called Until Now: A Life in Photographs because I’m still doing it, and hope to carry on for a long time yet. Still, I look through those older photos and there are so many people in them that aren’t here any more. People don’t last for ever, but photos of them do.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy: BeezerBeezer’s CVBorn:Bristol, 1965High point:“Having 93 simultaneous exhibitions at Adidas stores across Japan when they were the main sponsors of myWild Dayzbook in 2004.

So we should all get behind a new drive to turn them into avid readers. Why not start with books about art?Katy HesselWed 7 Jan 2026 12.06 ESTLast modified on Wed 7 Jan 2026 20.44 ESTShareAgirl on the cusp of adolescencegazes down at a book. Her left hand rests against her flushed pink cheeks, while her right clutches the pages, ready to turn to find out what happens next. She has porcelain-like skin and golden hair seemingly full of air, executed in textures that contrast with the scratchy, loose marks that make up her shirt and the book’s pages. When I look at this drawing, I am struck by how the artist, the American-born impressionist Mary Cassatt, has perfectly captured the all-consuming sensation of being submerged in a book – the feeling that the whole world is dissolving around you. For a moment, only that story matters.Cassatt, who worked in Paris for most of her adult life when women were finally beginning to be accepted as artists (and deserving of state-funded art education), was hailed for her intimate portrayals of women and children. They are glimpses into their minds, their private worlds, yet they also emphasise intellect and ambition.Young Girl Readingis one such example. I often wonder if she is reading something like Louisa May Alcott’s Little Women, published nearly three decades before, which tells the story of the four March sisters, who are figuring out their journey to womanhood themselves.My reader is encouraged to make 'wish trees' in the manner of Yoko OnoIt’s a striking image for many reasons, one that it makes me think about all the works that helped me through adolescence. But it also feels especially pertinent today in a world where being immersed in a story is fast becoming a thing of the past for young people. Instead, it is being replaced with social media addiction that chips away at growing, flourishing brains. In 2025, the NationalLiteracyTrust (NLT) found that the percentage of children and young people in the UK who “enjoyed reading” was at its lowest for 20 years. Fewer than one in five 8-18-year-olds said they read “something daily” in their free time, marking a 36% decrease in enjoyment levels since 2005.That is why the charity is making 2026 the National Year of Reading: a UK-wide, government-supported initiative, driven by the NLT, to help more people rediscover the joy of reading. The aim is to distribute 72,000 new books to children with the greatest need. While Louisa May Alcott might be appealing for some, the campaign wants to find books all children might enjoy – starting with what they’re passionate about, from history to sport, from film to art.View image in fullscreen‘I enjoyed teaching people who had no interest in art’ … Georgia O’Keeffe in Albuquerque, New Mexico, 1960.Photograph: Tony Vaccaro/Getty ImagesI recently read a riveting biography of English footballer Bukayo Saka with my six-year-old nephew, but it is an enjoyment of art that I’m hoping to instil in young readers through my new book,The Story of Art Without Men: An Illustrated Guide to Amazing Women Artists. It’s a version of my2022 book for adults– a play on EH Gombrich’s The Story of Art, which failed to mention a single woman until Käthe Kollwitz was added to its 16th edition. However, this book is really designed for readers of all ages. It is brought to life with beautiful illustrations by Ping Zhu that complement a wide range of artwork from across the globe, shaping the last 500 years of art history.There are new chapters, such as one about the dazzling world of First NationsArtin Australia, inspired by the recent Emily Kam Kngwarray exhibition at Tate Modern in London. The book is also highly interactive. Each chapter is centred on a movement and features an “art task” that, I hope, will not only help my reader understand how a work might relate to their life, but encourage them to make their own version of what they are reading about.When discussing the 17th-century Flemish painter Clara Peeters – known for hiding self-portraits in her still lifes, to make sure no man claimed her work as his own – I ask my reader to conceal a self-portrait in a picture of something else. In the chapter that introduces the postwar world of abstract expressionism, which also had an impact on literature, I ask my reader to make a drawing to accompany their favourite poem. Or get a friend to write one and together think about what colours you might use to capture it – just likeJoan Mitchell and James Schuylerdid. Likewise, my reader is encouraged to make “wish trees”, in the manner of Yoko Ono, or turn their favourite singer or actor into a pop art image. I hope the book will be a great tool for teachers wanting to integrate art into their classrooms, too.View image in fullscreenPainter Joan Mitchell, 1991.Photograph: David Turnley/Corbis/VCG/Getty ImagesGeorgia O’Keeffe, before venturing to New York City and finding fame, taught art in the public school system in Amarillo, Texas. According to her biographer Roxana Robinson, O’Keeffe, far from taking an authoritarian approach, “brought to the study of art a clarity and an attention that the students found exhilarating”. The book emulates her inclusive approach to art education, whatever someone’s background or knowledge. As O’Keeffe once said: “I enjoyed teaching people who had no particular interest in art.”We are lucky in the UK to have free entry to museums’ permanent collections. So let’s not only get young people reading about and looking at art in books, but into museums, too. If a young person says they have no interest in art, then let’s widen the focus to art history, an umbrella that covers many different subjects. What if there’s a painting of your favourite author or musician? Or an artwork that deals with technology or the environment?So if you are keen for your child to partake in the National Year of Reading, why not start with art? It’s an activity that families can do together, at very little cost. That was my way in, as the youngest sibling whose eldest sister encouraged me to get the tube with her and draw what we found. I’m hoping that 2026 will be the year that young people of all backgrounds feel welcome in museum spaces, can find that book for them, rediscover the joy of reading – and have the sensation of Cassatt’s Young Girl Reading.Books and art stimulate the mind. They get us to dream, to imagine worlds beyond our realm, transport us through time, teach us about other people in a way that inadvertently teaches us about ourselves. Above all, they show us that the human imagination is a superpower no machine can replace.The Story of Art Without Men: An Illustrated Guide to Amazing Women Artistsby Katy Hessel is published by Puffin (£20) on 5 MarchExplore more on these topicsBooksOpinionArt (Education)Art (Art and design)Art and design booksWomenPaintingLiteracyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

She talks about dread, dreams and her bid for ‘controlled chaos’Wed 7 Jan 2026 04.28 ESTLast modified on Wed 7 Jan 2026 07.48 ESTShareBefore her first Edinburgh fringe run last summer, Ayoade Bamgboye put a question to her comedy friends: “How do you debut?” She recalls their advice: “You introduce yourself, and there’s a point of view. There should also be a narrative arc. And you need to establish who you are as a comedian.” This was a lot to hear. “It filled me with dread,” says the 31-year-old. “There’s this recurring thought that you can only debut once. If it falls flat, then you’re just a shit debutante, forever.”Reader, Bamgboye avoided this fate, and then some. A fringe first-timer with a very slender comedy CV behind her, the Londoner-via-Lagos arrived at the festival with a fresh-minted show, Swings and Roundabouts, and left clutching theprestigious best newcomer award, as formerly won by Harry Hill, Sarah Millican andTim Minchin. (She was the first Black woman to win the award.) It’s a ticket to the big time and Bamgboye is still reeling. “These past months have been very difficult, getting out of my head and out of my own way. That question of: why me, why this, why now?” Sometimes, only a cliche will cover it. “It changed my life,” says Bamgboye flatly. “I hate to say stuff like that, but it did.”View image in fullscreen‘Every single day was such a variation’ … Bamgboye at the Edinburgh fringe in 2025.You can believe she hates to say it: as an hour in her company makes clear, Bamgboye is a searching thinker, a caretaker of words, playfully alert to their connotations. This is not a woman to drop a hackneyed phrase – or at least, not without wondering why the London Borough of Hackney is getting the blame for it. Several times during our chat, she withdraws a notebook to jot down idioms that sound curious to her African incomer’s ear. One anthropological section of Swings and Roundabouts is dedicated to British phrases that connote misery. A captivating feature of the show is the slippery fun it has with Bamgboye’s cross-cultural identity – a well-spoken Englishwoman when it pleases her, flipping into Nigerian-accented outsiderdom between words, sentences, at will.View image in fullscreenBamgboye with her Edinburgh Comedy award for best newcomer.Photograph: Alan RennieShe’s the same in conversation, a vocal shapeshifter – the product of a childhood shuttling back and forth from Lagos to a Lake District boarding school. Swings and Roundabouts showcases a woman raised like a gift from God (her name, she crows onstage, means “crown of joy”) but living uneasily in adulthood, caught between continents, grieving the loss of her beloved dad. “With this show I wanted to introduce myself and to share how difficult I find it to be alive,” she says – but, if you’re thinking “trauma comedy”, that radically undersells the joyful whirlwind experience of watching Bamgboye’s debut. Try this instead: “I’m trying to find a creative practice that’s like a controlled chaos. I wanted to split the difference between ‘you’re in safe hands’ and ‘you don’t know what’s going to happen next’.”Or try her response to my request for her comedy influences, which elicits the never-before-combined trio of Jack Black, Maya Rudolph andChris Morris. Bamgboye is nothing if not her own woman, a relative comedy ingenue who had “never really told the same joke twice” before her Edinburgh run – and who approached the fringe thinking that “if I’m going to be saying and doing the same thing over and again for a month, it has to be something that’s exciting for me to say and do”. The revelation last summer for Bamgboye was that, just because the words are repeated, the in-the-moment encounter with an audience can be renewed completely from one night to the next. “Every single day was such a variation. Every day something in the room or from the audience gave me something new to play with.”Ayoade Bamgboye: Swings and Roundabouts review – commanding comic’s thrilling debutRead more“Since then, there’s a change in the kind of performance I want to do, and it puts the people in front of me first.” In conversation, Bamgboye is bursting with a sense of the possibilities her new comedy life has opened up to her. Until recently, she was a drifting creative in the arts and media, including working as assistant to the director Yorgos Lanthimos on his moviePoor Things. Now, cooking up a new set about small talk, and crash-coursing a comedy education from her various mentors (who includeJamali Maddixand previous best newcomer champLara Ricote), “my whole existence,” says Bamgboye, “is now set-ups for jokes, and it makes me more excited to live”.“Maybe that’s too much,” she edits herself, characteristically. “But it has been a real gift to learn how to express myself in this way. And this is just the beginning. There are so many things I still want to try in comedy. I feel like a guest [in this industry] who hasn’t taken her shoes off yet. I haven’t even been upstairs. Now I’m here, I’m in it for the long haul.”Ayoade Bamgboye: Swings and Roundabouts is atSoho theatre, London, 13-24 January and 20 April-2 May and istouringExplore more on these topicsComedyEdinburgh festival 2025Edinburgh festivalSoho theatreinterviewsShareReuse this content"

So why the backlash?Jesse HassengerWed 7 Jan 2026 04.47 ESTLast modified on Wed 7 Jan 2026 12.27 ESTShareIn the new hit movieMarty Supreme, the story is pushed forward by how lead character Marty Mauser keeps making messes then, rather than cleaning them up, manages to expand their scope beyond reason. Marty is attempting to prove himself as the world’s greatest table-tennis champion, to escape his meagre mid-century New York City circumstances and achieve a dream he’s locked on to, seemingly more out of desire to achieve it than a particular love for the sport.And just as he’s presumably blown up some natural athleticism into a monomaniacal quest, all of Marty’s misdeeds across the film escalate. He cajoles, then lies. He quickly turns a pushy request to borrow money into petty theft, which then becomes armed robbery. At one point, a little ping-pong hustle at a New Jersey bowling alley literally blows up into a gas-station fire. Marty will not accept anything less than ultimate victory, which means he will especially not accept responsibility for his actions. And we, in the audience, are invited to like him anyway, at least in part because he is played byTimothée Chalamet.As Marty Supreme has reached a sizable audience, that last bit has become a sticking point, at least for some. There are plenty of YouTube and TikTok videos asking why, exactly, we’re supposed to be happily following this near-sociopathic character for well over two hours, causing publications such as Variety toweigh inon Marty (and Chalamet’s) likability.View image in fullscreen‘Unpleasant’ … Jennifer Lawrence in Die My Love.Photograph: Kimberly FrenchThis is not the first likability conversation inspired by an awards-season contender, and it won’t be the last. But it feels like the first time in a while that this kind of bafflement (or tut-tutting) has been expressed toward a male lead in particular. The self-interested protagonists of best picture nominees such as Birdman, American Hustle, Joker, or Once Upon a Time in Hollywood didn’t appear to inspire much discourse about whether they were proper male role models; those discussions more often turn to women, especially in depictions of motherhood, such as Jennifer Lawrence’s character in the recent Die My Love. That movie barely seems to be in the awards conversation despite a bravura turn from Lawrence, in part because of the sheer difficulty audiences have found in getting on the movie’s aggressive, “unpleasant” wavelength.So in a way, the regression to fretting about the likability of Marty Mauser feels weirdly just. But there may still be some gendering going on here; it’s hard to untangle questions of Marty’s likability from Chalamet himself, particularly his combination of a slender, more stereotypically “feminine” appearance and semi-parodic macho bravado (in the film and his tireless promotion of it). Rather than his star charisma mitigating Marty’s bad behaviour, Chalamet’s beauty (and appeal to female fans) only seems to further inflame anyone who might not be convinced by his big-noise status.It’s happened repeatedly with Chalamet’s closest analog in ambition and star power:Leonardo DiCaprio– whom audiences and critics have most recently greeted as downright lovable playing a burnt-out, half-competent ex-radical in One Battle After Another. But in movies such as Killers of the Flower Moon and especially The Wolf of Wall Street, DiCaprio faced questions of whether he and the movies in question were glorifying criminals simply by depicting them at such length. DiCaprio’s Jordan Belfort (like Marty Mauser, based on a real-life figure, though the Marty Supreme adaptation is far looser) was a particular object of ire, with hand-wringing over whether audiences could even really discern Belfort’s criminality when cast in the megastar image of Leo.To complain about a character’s likability while also worrying about modelling poor behaviour is to place yourself above the rest of the audience; sure, you understand how bad this guy is, but what about all the dolts who aren’t so enlightened? Let’s assume, though, that at least some objections to Marty Supreme are not concern-trolling but genuine dislike: a visceral reaction against spending 150 minutes with such a selfish jerk (and scepticism over whether the film’s ending even begins to redeem him). Who can’t identify with feeling an animal dislike toward a fresh-faced brat? As it happens, I get it from a lot of YouTubers and TikTok scolds.View image in fullscreenNo prize for likability … Timothée Chalamet wins best actor for Marty Supreme at the Critics Choice awards this month.Photograph: Kevin Winter/Getty Images for Critics Choice AssociationBut lingering questions of a character’s likability – their ability to serve as a rooting interest, a figure of audience identification, or even a charismatic antihero – can feel like a particular curse and gift of the cinema. A novel can (if the author so chooses) dig deeper into a specific character’s psychology, and while there will always be readers who, say, whine about Holden Caulfield’s whininess, there are also plenty of English teachers who can guide readers through The Catcher in the Rye or other books where the protagonist may not scan as a lovably scrappy underdog (or whatever students may have been mistrained to expect from literature).Movies, though, don’t come with the same degree of instruction. We’re not taught as much about how or why to “read” them as students, and they’re presented foremost as entertainment. As much as they can and should be vehicles for more than that, mainstream cinema has also spent more than a century basking in the glow of stars. A movie star’s job, after all, is to draw and hold our attention, even if the immediate circumstances of their surroundings might otherwise strike us as overfamiliar, obtuse or dull. When a star pushes too hard, too soon, against that innate expectation of likability, it can feel like a broken contract.‘I fear electromagnetic catastrophe’: Josh Safdie on Marty Supreme, latent Jewish anxiety and why men are lostRead moreThe art of cinema deserves more than demanding shiny things for our amusement, of course, but it’s also uniquely able to provide those shiny things. Tedious likability conversations may be the price we pay for that beguilement – which is also never going to work equally on every single audience member. Some who blanch at Chalamet’s snot-nosed, self-inflated insouciance in Marty Supreme may find themselves, in 20 years, watching Chalamet play an equally “unlikable” character and be charmed by him anyway. I’m honestly not all that convinced there’s a literary depth to Marty Mauser’s sins, but then, it also didn’t occur to me to disconnect from Marty Supreme for that reason. In a film culture that often seems to be aspiring to homogenisation, being allowed to spend time in the company of immoral or obnoxious characters can feel like its own strange magic trick. Likability may be an unfair demand placed on cinema, but such an expansive medium is, in the long run, more than up to the task.Explore more on these topicsMarty SupremeTimothée ChalametLeonardo DiCapriofeaturesShareReuse this content"

The experience was fun – but also led to horrendous online abuse. Now she’s back, playing a tough and surprising matriarch in the Regency smash hitWed 7 Jan 2026 05.00 ESTShareSome actors might have been a little put out to audition for the role of the beautiful young romantic lead, and instead be cast as her mother, but not Katie Leung. “Absolutely not,” she says with a laugh. “I look young for my age – as most people in the west think Asians do – but I felt really seen to finally get to play the role of a mother.” She is a mother, she points out, and anyway, the role of Lady Araminta Gun, the steely aristo who is about to rock the new series of Netflix’s Regency behemothBridgerton, is so delicious, who could be insulted?Araminta, widowed, has seen off two husbands, and now she’s trying to marry off her two teenage daughters, ideally to a Bridgerton, while keeping her stepdaughter, Sophie, in her place – as a Cinderella-style servant for the family. “The showrunners reassured me that it wasn’t going to be the archetypal evil stepmother role,” says Leung. “They wanted to find the humanity in Araminta. They wanted to ensure I knew her background, her struggles, why she makes these decisions, and why she’s so formidable.”View image in fullscreenKatie as Lady Araminta Gun in Bridgerton.Photograph: Liam Daniel/NetflixShe is, though, from the four episodes I’ve seen, pretty evil to Sophie. Leung agrees. “The thing about her, and with so many of the characters in Bridgerton, is they do these awful things, they make mistakes, they’re human. When you see the final episode, you might think differently, and that’s wonderful, because normally you don’t get to do that with these ‘evil’ characters. Her drive comes from love and protection for her daughters. I get it, having become a mum,” she says – her son has recently turned three. “You will do anything for your kids. I don’t think I would have felt that way before.”What is it like to join a show as big as Bridgerton? “I feel really blessed, genuinely,” she says. She is used to huge productions – her first role was Cho Chang in the Harry Potter films. “It feels quite familiar, in a sense. Also I’m older, and at a place in my life where I’m not too fazed going into something seemingly so huge.” The Harry Potter films coincided with the rise of social media and extreme online fandom – something the stars of Bridgerton have also had to deal with, much of itintense, appalling and racist.If Leung is concerned, she doesn’t show it. She went through it withHarry Potter, and to some extent with Arcane, the animated Netflix show based on the League of Legends video game universe, in which she voices a character. Leung says she has learned to have a healthy distance from the noise surrounding her job. “I still care about the craft [of acting], I still want to do well, but I can park it once I’m done for the day and go home and live this other life. It’s more like a job for me than the be-all and end-all, which is how I felt about acting when I was in my 20s.”View image in fullscreenKatie (second left) in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire.Photograph: TCD/Prod.DB/AlamyLeung seems grounded and thoughtful. She has campaigned to raise awareness of sexual violence against women, and on Instagram she is as likely to post about the horrors in Gaza as her own work. We talk about the rise of the far right, and watching anti-immigrant rhetoric spread throughout the UK. It’s frightening, she says: “I feel as if I’ve experienced it, in the supermarket, in day-to-day life. I’m very aware that I live in a bubble in London, because if there’s anywhere that’s diverse, it’s London.” In her area, especially, she says, “there’s a real sense of community and inclusion and all these things, and even then, I’m experiencing it. I’m concerned. And it’s not just Britain, it’s all over the world.”Leung grew up moving between various towns in Scotland, because of her father’s job running a wholesale business. She became an actor by accident. She didn’t even do plays at school, except one production of the musical Bugsy Malone, and even then she appeared as a dancer. Her father spotted an open audition for Harry Potter and suggested it to Leung. She was less interested in landing the role than in getting her divorced parents in the same room for the first time in years – as her mother would accompany them to the audition.“My mum and dad hadn’t seen each other for a long time, but I was really excited, because I guess in my 16-year-old mind there was still a possibility that they might get back together.” She smiles. When she took part in the audition in London, the first three Harry Potter films had already been huge, and it felt like there were thousands of people queueing outside, she says. She thought she had no chance of getting it.View image in fullscreenAs an unauthorised migrant, Ying, in Channel 4’s Run.Photograph: Des Willie/Channel 4Leung’s parents split up when she was three, and her mother, who worked in finance, went to live in Hong Kong. Leung and her brother were raised by their father (he remarried, and she also has younger siblings). “To be honest, it was my grandmother who really raised me. My dad was working full-time.” It must have been hard, and fairly unusual, to grow up without her mother around. “Yeah,” says Leung, carefully. “It’s such a huge part of my identity, it’s not something I can ignore and say it didn’t have a huge impact on my life. But because I’m really happy with where I am and who I am, [although there is] obviously still lots of work to be done, I wouldn’t have it any other way.” Leung and her mother were in touch throughout her childhood, and have a good relationship now, she says.How did she deal with the extreme and sudden fame that came with Harry Potter? “I don’t think I did,” she says. “It was overwhelming from the get-go. Being in the spotlight from that age, when you’re already insecure, was difficult, to say the least.” She’s more aware of it now, she says, looking back. “At the time, I was having a lot of fun. I thought: this is different from school, and I really did not enjoy school. So it was a way to escape. I’m still trying to figure it out, really, how it affected me.”The young actors were looked after, she says, even if conversations about mental health, and particularly the impact on young stars, weren’t as advanced as they are today. “I don’t know if anything could have been done back then to make things better or easier,” she says. “At that age, you’re curious. I remember being very curious about what people were saying about me, and I was Googling myself. Nobody could have stopped me, because I was old enough to make up my own mind.”What she found online was horrendous racism and hurtful personal comments. How did she cope with that? “I didn’t. I think it just sat with me, and it affected me in ways like, ‘Oh yeah, I made that decision because people were saying this about me.’ It probably made me less outgoing. I was very self-aware of what was coming out of my mouth.” It didn’t help, she says, that being catapulted into this successful career meant she felt she hadn’t earned it. “It happened by pure chance,” she says, underplaying her talent, as if it had been a lottery. “And for the longest time, I may have tried to make up for it, and overcompensate.”I was really hard on myself. I was trying to constantly prove I was more than just the actor from Harry PotterLeung was in the last five films of the series. “I remember coming out of it and thinking, ‘Nothing’s going to beat it,’ because it was so successful. I remember being lost, going, ‘What’s next? People will have these high expectations of me topping it, and it’s never going to happen.’ I think I was so afraid of meeting these expectations that I gave up, or didn’t give myself the chance, after it, to try and continue acting.” She started a degree in photography, but towards the end of her studies, got a part in a play. On stage, she remembers thinking, “No, actually, this is what I want to do.”She went on to study drama at the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland. Did she feel conscious that she was the actor from Harry Potter? “Oh my God, yes, absolutely. I tried really hard not to mention it, even when we were doing introductions at the beginning of the year, even though everybody knew. I didn’t want people to think that was the reason I got in. Not that it was, but I was really hard on myself. I was trying to constantly prove I was more than just the actor from Harry Potter.” (The films, she stresses, are “such a huge part of where I came from, and I’m grateful for it, and it still resonates with a lot of people”.)View image in fullscreenAs the formidable Lady Araminta Gao, with (left) Isabella Wei as Posy Li and Michelle Mao as Rosamund Li, in Bridgerton.Photograph: Liam Daniel/NetflixFor a long time after drama school, Leung was mainly considered for roles that were “these kind of epic tales of the east, whether that be North Korea or China. Deep, dark subject matters.” In the BBC drama One Child, she played the child of a Chinese mother, adopted by a British-American couple; and in Channel 4’s Run, an unauthorised migrant. She enjoyed these roles, she says, “and it gave me the chance to be more knowledgable about the world, and the injustices that happen around us all the time”. But it also felt limiting. “It’s one of these things where just because there weren’t many roles out there, I was incredibly grateful to be considered. A large part of that was me, again, giving myself a hard time, thinking I wasn’t deserving of anything.”She remembers the end of school, and the yearbook in which people had written who they thought their fellow students would become; Leung was described as the next Lucy Liu, the Hollywood actor. “Obviously I’m a huge fan of Lucy Liu, she’s had great longevity in her career, but that irked me. I remember thinking, why not Meryl Streep? I was kind of restricted by my race, and I guess Lucy Liu was the only other Asian actor that was, at the time, on the big screen.”What would it have meant to Leung to see a lead – in Bridgerton, Yerin Ha plays her stepdaughter, Sophie, whose storyline, and potential romance with Benedict Bridgerton, powers the fourth season – who looked like her, in one of the biggest shows in the world, when she was growing up? “I’m envious of the younger generation who are getting to see people that represent them on screens now,” she says. “I know it would have done me good.”When she works with younger actors such as Ha, does she get a sense that their experience has been different from hers? “We’re still a long way away from where we need to be. It’s better, but it’s not as good as it needs to be. I really admire the younger generation because they are more self-aware and they express themselves in a way that I, once upon a time, did not. Even now, I’m working on myself, to say what I need, whether it’s in a relationship or at the workplace, with my mum or my partner. It’s really fundamental to having any good relationship with anybody.”View image in fullscreenHaving a moment with Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) in Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix.Photograph: Digital Fusion Image Library/Globe Photos/ZUMA Press Wire/ShutterstockLeung thinks the quirky BBC crime drama Annika might have been the first time she was cast in a role where her ethnicity wasn’t relevant (though her Scottishness was, playing a detective with Glasgow’s Marine Homicide Unit). Progress has been slow, but it is happening, she says. “We’re getting there, and especially with a role like Araminta in Bridgerton, being able to play a mother who has daughters – this kind of family dynamic is something I feel is always lacking. That’s where we need to try and get to now.” As opposed, she says, to the smaller, incidental roles – a journalist, say, or a social worker – “who has no ties to the rest of the cast. Because it is all about relationships.”Bridgerton’s famously diverse cast has changed the landscape for period drama. “Their inclusion and diversity behind and in front of the camera is just …” Leung smiles. “You can see it and feel it, and that made me feel really safe to be able to kind of play as an actor.” Still, disappointingly, but not unsurprisingly, Bridgerton’s “colour-conscious” casting has been criticised. Will we ever get to the point when a show can do this, and not be? “The more we can have it, the less of a thing it becomes. But for now, we’re kind of in the middle of it,” says Leung. But it goes to show that it works. “The reason it’s successful is because the writing is great, the directing is great, the acting, the relationships between the characters.”Next, Leung is about to film another role in Scotland, which she can’t say much about, except it’s an interesting role with a “kind of flexibility for me to play with it, so I’m really excited”. She has reached a point, she says, where she no longer questions whether she deserves her career. “I know who I am. I know what I can do.”Explore more on these topicsDramaBridgertonHarry PotterRacefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Sign up hereKeza MacDonaldWed 7 Jan 2026 10.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 7 Jan 2026 10.02 ESTShareIt had begun to feel like an endurance test by the end, but nonetheless, like the sucker I am, I watched theStranger Thingsfinale last week. Andspoiler warning: I’m going to talk about it in general terms in this newsletter. Because approximately 80% of the final season comprised twentysomething “teenagers” explaining things to each other while using random 1980s objects to illustrate convoluted plans and plot points, my expectations were not high. After an interminable hour, finally, something fun happens, as the not-kids arm themselves with machine guns and molotovs and face off against a monstrously gigantic demon-crab. Aha, I thought – the final boss battle!The fight was like something out of Monster Hunter, all scale and spectacle with a touch of desperation. For a very long time, video games sought to imitate cinema. Now cinema (and TV) often feels like a video game. The structure of Stranger Things’ final season reminded me a lot of Resident Evil: long periods of walking slowly through corridors, with characters exchanging plot information aloud on their way to the action, and occasional explosions of gunfire, screeching monsters or car chases. Those long periods of relative inaction are much more tolerable when you’ve got a controller in your hands. I am all for TV and film embracing the excitement, spectacle and dynamism of video games, but do they have to embrace the unnecessary side-quests and open-world bloat, too?The reciprocally influential relationship between games, TV and film has developed a lot in the last few years. Ageneration of gen X and elder-millennial gamers have recently aged into creative and commissioning power in these industries. That’s why we’re getting people such as Jonathan Nolan heading up an excellentFallout TV show, and indeed why all video-game-to-screen adaptations have become dramatically less terrible in the past five years or so. It also inevitably means that the boundaries between interactive and non-interactive entertainment are becoming more porous: where previously game-makers were heavily influenced by film (primarily but notexclusively Alien/s and Star Wars), now that relationship works both ways. Most Marvel movies look and feel like a video game to me, and not just because they’re all full of computer-generated graphics. It’s the mood and pace of them.View image in fullscreenAnyone for Halo? … Emily Blunt in 2014 movie Edge of Tomorrow.Photograph: David James/Warner Bros/AllstarEdge of Tomorrow remains the most video-game-ish movie I’ve ever seen: its premise revolves around dying and respawning, trying out different things on each run. It’s a sci-fi roguelike of a film. I wanted to playMad Max: Fury Roadthe entire time I was watching it, and John Wick 4 was literally a fighting-game boss rush. When film critics say that a film feels like a video game, they often mean it disparagingly; a lot of cinephiles still see games as the lower form. When I say a movie feels like a video game, it’s a compliment – unless it feels like aboringvideo game.This was the problem, for me, with Stranger Things: every episode felt like loading up an open-world game that I hadn’t played for a few months. More and more characters kept appearing, and I didn’t remember or care who most of them were. Between the Upside Down, Vecna’s mindscape, real-world Hawkins and an entirely new dimension introduced in the last couple of episodes, there were too many locations to keep track of. Every episode brought on the mild despair I feel when I think I’m near the end of an overlong game, only to discover yet another entirely new area to explore. The painfully long epilogue, meanwhile, was rivalled only by Red Dead Redemption 2’s interminable post-game hours. Please, just let it end already!Of course, in modern pop culture, nothing is ever allowed to end properly, not if it’s still making money. I’m surprised there’s been no word of an official Stranger Things video game tie-in (outside of a retro-style smartphone beat-em-up from 2019). Come to think of it, we don’t see many of these kinds of licensed games any more: back in the 00s and 2010s, most major movies and TV shows launched with an interactive accompaniment. Presumably this is because of the spiralling cost of game development – you can’t knock out a mediocrePlayStation2 game in nine months any more – but also, when TV shows feel so much like games, do we really need an adaptation anyway?What to playView image in fullscreenStrange and surreal … Indika.Photograph: Odd MeterThe first game I’ve finished in 2026 isIndika, a surreal and mildly horrible game about a young nun questioning her faith and having conversations with the devil as she goes on an extremely strange journey through bleak, snow-covered villages and abandoned factories with an escaped convict. There are much-needed flashes of humour in here, but also stuff about religion, control and sexuality that I haven’t seen in a video game before. It’s also part of a small wave of games (see Baby Steps) that mocks gamer mentality: there are points, but they are pointless; explore off the beaten path and you will find something useless and inconsequential rather than a secret or something fun. And that’s if you find anything at all.Available on:PC, PS5, Xbox, Nintendo SwitchEstimated playtime:five hoursWhat to readView image in fullscreenInnovator … Sega’s David Rosen, who died in December.Photograph: American Amusement Machine AssociationDavid Rosen, the co-founder of Sega and an influential figure in the history of arcade video games, died on Christmas Day at 95.

I guessed GTA, Fortnite, Call of Duty, Minecraft and EA FC, but don’t have huge confidence in that!You’re not far off. According to data from Circana, the top five most played games on PlayStation 5 this year were exactly the same as last year:Fortnite,Call of Duty,Grand Theft Auto 5(including Online),RobloxandMinecraft. All of these games are five to 10-plus years old. This stagnation at the top is why every big publisher has spent millions in the last decade trying to create live-service games, and why most of them have flopped. Last year on Steam, meanwhile, only 14% of all playtime was spent on new games released in 2025. Any developer releasing something new, be they blockbuster or indie, is competing for a sliver of a sliver of players’ time and money. These stats explain a lot about why the games industry is where it is right now, and why there’s such a bleak mood among many developers.Explore more on these topicsGamesPushing Buttons newsletterStranger ThingsMad Max: Fury RoadEdge of TomorrowTelevisionPlayStationfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Five creative ways to make 2026 happier, healthier and more hopefulEngaging increativity can reduce depression, improve immunity and delay ageing – all while you’re having funDaisy FancourtWed 7 Jan 2026 00.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 7 Jan 2026 13.47 ESTShareFor some reason, we have collectively agreed that new year is the time to reinvent ourselves. The problem, for many people, is that we’ve tried all the usual health kicks – running, yoga, meditation, the latest diets – even if we haven’t really enjoyed them, in a bid to improve our minds and bodies. But have any of us given as much thought to creativity? Allow me to suggest that this year be a time to embrace the arts.Ever since our Paleolithic ancestors began painting caves, carving figurines, dancing and singing, engaging in the arts has been interwoven with health and healing. Look through the early writings of every major medical tradition around the world and you find the arts. What is much newer – and rapidly accelerating over the past two decades – is a blossoming scientific evidence-base identifying and quantifying exactly what the health benefits of the arts are.Randomised trials on the mental health benefits of the arts now number in triple figures, with regular singing, dancing, reading, crafts, and cultural pursuits shown to reduce symptoms of anxiety, depression and stress for people of all ages.Some studiessuggest that combining creative arts therapies such as music therapy with antidepressants and counselling can nearly double the improvements in depressive symptoms compared with standard treatments alone. But the arts can also be beneficial preventatively. People who regularly go to the theatre, live music events, museums, galleries and the cinema havenearly half the risk of developing depression. This is not merely because such people tend to be wealthier or healthier or engaged in other health-promoting behaviours. It’s actually independent of socio-demographic characteristics, lifestyle and even genetics.People who regularly go to the theatre, live music, museums or galleries have nearly half the risk of depressionInstead, neuroscience research and psychological experiments have revealed that when we engage in the arts, we give our brains what theywantto be happy – we activate the same pleasure and reward networks in the brain that are activated by food, sex and drugs, and we experience the benefits of hormones such as dopamine that improve our mood. We also give our brains what weneed– dancing, singing, crafting and writing help fulfil core psychological needs that are the building blocks of our mental health, such as autonomy, control and a sense of mastery. Crucially, the arts give us an effective way to regulate our emotions – calming or invigorating us as the situation demands, which helps us buffer and deal with life stresses more effectively.For our brains, the arts are a very efficient workout, engaging diverse regions involved in sensory processing, memory, movement, pattern recognition and emotions (among others). Over time, regular arts engagement can strengthen connectivity between brain regions and even increase the volume of grey matter. In fact, amateur musicians and artists have stronger connections between parts of the brain that are vulnerable to ageing, and areidentifiable in brain images as “younger”.View image in fullscreenGoing to cultural events such as concerts builds ‘cognitive reserve’.Photograph: Posed by models; Maki Nakamura/Getty ImagesParticipating in arts, crafts, reading, playing musical instruments and going to cultural events and performances builds what is known as “cognitive reserve”: the resilience of the brain against cognitive decline. So even if we start to develop the pathological indications of dementia, our brains cancompensate for longer. In fact, even when we’ve taken lifestyle and personal characteristics into account, people who are regularly engaged in cultural activities perform better on cognitive tests as they age, showing slower rates of decline in ability and alower risk of developing dementia, and they are on average older if and when they do get that diagnosis than people who aren’t engaged in the arts.For our bodies, there is no physiological system the arts do not affect. When we breathe deeply for an activity such as singing, we improve the strength of our respiratory muscles, giving our lungs thesame level of workoutas a brisk walk. When we dance, we can experience decreases in blood pressure and glucose levels – improvements that are stronger than if we do similar exercises without the creative element of dance. Arts engagement improves immune activity, lowering levels of inflammation that influence both our physicaland mental health. Studies just emerging even indicate that arts engagement influences gene expression, with people showing patterns of gene expression (known as “epigenetic clocks”) that areyounger than those of people who don’t engagein the arts. Whether we’re keeping our fingers nimble with crochet, our bodies fit through dance, or keeping ourselves active by going to gigs and cultural venues, engaging with the arts reduces our risks of developing chronic pain, physical impairments and frailty – even when other health behaviours such as exercise have already been taken into account –extending our “healthspan”.The arts can activate the same reward networks in the brain as food and sexI want to be clear – the arts are not a panacea. In fact, there are examples of the arts doing more harm than good, from loud music andsurrealist artbeing used as a means of torture for prisoners,to art being used as a way to flaunt wealth and power within society. But it’s not an exaggeration to say that the arts could save your life. Over the years I’ve met a number of people who have told me stories of how painting, reading, dancing or acting became the lifeline that got them through seemingly impossible times.I bet if a new drug came on the market offering the same catalogue of benefits as the arts, most people would want to take it. Instead, many of us see engaging in the arts as a luxury rather than a necessity. Even though they may be exactly what we need to improve our health and wellbeing.So I invite you to be brutally honest with yourself. How many minutes did you spend actively engaging in the arts yesterday? (By “actively” I mean that you weren’t multi-tasking at the time, so I don’t count plugging in your headphones and then zoning out.) When a representative sample of US adults answered that question recently,95% of them said zero. If you are currently part of that majority, here are five evidence-based recommendations to get you going.Find your creative pick-me-upView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Fotografía de eLuVe/Getty ImagesUse music and books to boost your mood. Swap your morning alarm for a song and take the time to listen to it before you get up. Swap doomscrolling on your commute for a novel. The dopamine release provided by stories and songs comes not only at the most joyous or exciting parts – the choruses in songs and climaxes in plotlines – but also from the tension that builds during the lead up to those moments, as our brains anticipate what’s coming. When a song or story feels too predictable, it can seem bland (think lift music) and there isn’t enough build-up of anticipation. If it’s too far outside our comfort zone, our brains don’t know how to judge it, so we miss the joy of the tension and resolution. So don’t feel pressure to pick a book or album you feel youshouldread or listen to. You can maximise the joy you get from the arts by finding your personal sweet spot between familiarity and complexity.Choose a new creative hobbyView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Posed by model; Thanasis Zovoilis/Getty ImagesIf you can dedicate between 30 and 60 minutes once a week to engaging in the arts, studies suggest you can expect to see improvements in your wellbeingwithin around six weeks. Think about which psychological needs aren’t being met in your life. If you’re feeling out of control, pick a hobby that lets you take the lead without needing instruction, such as drawing, creative writing or clay modelling. If you’re craving a feeling of mastery, try something that will allow you to develop a new skill. Crafts like crochet, or picking up a ukelele, can be a good option in winter, either with the support of YouTube demonstrations or a community class. Giving yourself a goal to work towards (a performance, or a gift to give to friends) can be a good motivator. Remember that failure is essential to building a sense of accomplishment, so if your pottery collapses or scarves unravel, practising dealing with such failures can build your sense of resilience.Get to an exhibitionWhether you’re a fan of Renaissance paintings, contemporary sculpture, immersive audiovisual installations or street art, exhibitions are a wonderful way to experience awe. But make sure you actually look! On average, we spendjust 28 secondslooking at art in exhibitions (and a fair chunk of that is often spent taking pictures). We need three or four seconds to form a basic emotional response and 10 seconds to decide cognitivelywhat we think about an artwork. But if we’re hoping the encounter will be more meaningful, we need time to look, think, respond, look again, and so on, and this takes minutes, not seconds. So don’t try to take in too much at once. It’s better to meaningfully engage with just a few exhibits on an arts expedition than try to take in everything.Use rhythm to enhance your exercise routineWhen we listen to music and dance, our movements, breathing and heartrates all synchronise to the beat. If the music is motivational in style (upbeat, peppy, joyful), we will run further, pedal faster, or do20% more bench presses in the same amount of time. Music can also inhibit physiological feedback signals of fatigue and pain and make us more efficient in our movements. Effectively, music is a legal performance-enhancing drug. A tempo of 125-140 bpm is a good rule of thumb when you’re working out, although you can push it higher if you’re trying to synchronise movements such as your running gait.Indulge in some make believeView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Posed by models; MoMo Productions/Getty ImagesAs adults, we have a tendency to dismiss play as frivolous and childish. How wrong we are. When we enter imaginary worlds, the temporary suspension of social norms and hierarchies allows us to understand the world from different angles, which helps our brains build mental flexibility to deal with unpredictable changes in our lives. So embrace your imagination, whether that’s by hosting a murder mystery acting evening, cosplaying, or finding a carnival or festival to put into your diary.I’ll be honest: most of the health fads I’ve been sucked into over the years haven’t brought me much joy. But last January I decided instead to practice what I preach. I can honestly say that the mental highlights of the year since have all revolved around the arts experiences I had. I wish you similar success with your creative endeavours in 2026.Art Cure: The Science of How the Arts Transform Our Health by Daisy Fancourt is published by Cornerstone Press.

At the same time there was a slight decrease in the amount of films released: 1,092 in 2025, compared with 1,124 in 2024.The result is the highest total since 2019, which saw £1.35bn in total revenue, shortly before the collapse of the physical cinema box office the following year, to £323.7m, as Covid restrictions hit hard. Cinema revenues recovered to £595.5m in 2021, and £980.7m in 2022, only returning above £1bn in 2023, with a total of £1.06bn.The numbers of films on release suggest that the production pipeline, hit both by the pandemic and subsequent film industry strikes in 2023, has recovered, and is in fact exceeding pre-pandemic levels; in 2019, 938 films were released. Significantly however, a recalibration of strategy appears to be occurring, with 224 films recorded in 2025 as “saturation” releases (ie playing in over 250 venues simultaneously), compared with 200 in 2024 and 188 in 2019. According to Comscore, Downton Abbey: The Grand Finale had the widest opening in the UK in 2025, with over 750 cinemas.The highest grossing film of 2025 in the UK and Ireland was gaming adaptation A Minecraft Movie, whose viral impactincluding the “chicken jockey” scene, has translated into box office supremacy, with a total of £56.88m. The filmalso topped the 2025 North American box office, taking $423.9m, but only came in fifth at the worldwide box office with $958.3m – well behind the global leader,Chinese animation Ne Zha 2, whichreported returns of $2.24bn.Of British productions, the fourth Bridget Jones film, subtitled Mad About the Boy, finished the year as the most successful at the UK and Irish box office, taking £46.4m and coming well ahead of Downton Abbey: The Grand Finale and 28 Years Later in second and third place, with £18.4m and £15.6m respectively.The figures also revealed the continuing strength of “event cinema” releases which took a total of £44m (4.1% of the total), and which included 10 films taking more than £1m. Among these was the best ever performance for a stage production; the film of West End production Six the Musical amassed £6.2m – although this is well short of the record “event cinema” total of £12.3m for Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour in 2023.Phil Clapp, chief executive of the UK Cinema Association said: “Although it saw only a small year-on-year increase in box office, 2025 undoubtedly marked a significant further step in the sector’s recovery following the challenges of recent years. There is great optimism that the coming months will see significant further progress.”Explore more on these topicsFilmFilm industryA Minecraft MovienewsShareReuse this content"

It was so awesome.”Paltrow and the Coldplay frontman announced their split in 2014, after 11 years of marriage, in a long post on her Goop website, titled Conscious Uncoupling, explaining that “we have always conducted our relationship privately, and we hope that as we consciously uncouple and co-parent, we will be able to continue in the same manner.”The phrase was widely mocked at the time, but Paltrow told Poehler she believes it was the mindfulness of her and Martin’s approach to divorce that was really the cause of the backlash.“Say you had had a really nasty divorce, or your parents had had a really nasty divorce,” Paltrow said. “And then you hear this idea that like, it doesn’t have to be done this way. I think the implicit learning is like, ‘Oh, fuck. Like, they’re saying I did something wrong.’”She continued, “That makes sense to me, like, ‘Oh no, is the inference that I mess someone up?’ Like, that’s not a nice thing to contemplate. So I do understand why it was so personal for people.”Paltrow is now promoting Marty Supreme, in which she plays a fading star who has an affair with Timothée Chalamet’s ping-pong hustler. The role marks her return to movies after a 10-year break, in which she only made small appearances in Marvel movies.Writing in Vogue in 2022, Paltrow reflected on the aftermath of her separation statement by saying she was surprised by its intensity.“The public’s surprise gave way quickly to ire and derision. A strange combination of mockery and anger that I had never seen. I was already pretty tattered from what had been a tough year,” she wrote. “Frankly, the intensity of the response saw me bury my head in the sand deeper than I ever had in my very public life.”The following year, ina 2023 Instagram Q&A,the actor reclaimed the phrase and said she was proud of advocating for a positive and compassionate approach to separation.“It makes me feel pretty proud when people come up to me on the streets and say, ‘Thank you for introducing that concept because I’ve become good friends with my ex,’” she said. “I’m very happy that we were able to play a small part in that cultural shift.”Explore more on these topicsFilmGwyneth PaltrowDivorcenewsShareReuse this content"

Yes. But it’s mainly just tedious to watch these immature players and their teenage machinations as they battle for cashHannah J DaviesWed 7 Jan 2026 00.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 7 Jan 2026 00.06 ESTShareThe first season of Beast Games – the big-money reality challenge masterminded and hosted by internet personality Jimmy Donaldson, better known as MrBeast – prompted a lawsuit. Five anonymous contestants sued both the production companies behind the series and Donaldson himself, claiming that they had been kept “underfed and overtired”, and alleging an unsafe environment on the set of the Gladiators-ish, Squid Game-esque series (claims, of course, firmly denied by all parties). While the participants claimed they had been “shamelessly exploited” in the name of entertainment, this did little to impede the success of Beast Games, which went on to become Amazon’smost-watched unscripted series ever,garnering 50 million viewers in the month after its release.You may well come to Beast Games with a sense that this is a slightly murky, mercenary endeavour, the $5m grand prize (“generational wealth!!!!” says Donaldson) distracting from potential ethical issues just below the surface. Weirdly, though, moral issues will probably be the least of viewers’ concerns. More than ever, in its second series Beast Games also happens to be mindless, vibeless television, flecked with Squiddy sadism but also borrowing heavily from the Love Island playbook. As they stay up into the wee hours building improbably high towers from foam blocks or playing convoluted games of dodgeball, the contestants couple up, crash out and even seek to avenge fallen players. Take Luisitin, playing to defend the honour of his wife from series one, by badmouthing her former nemesis, Karim, to anyone who will listen (“he and his brother gaslit my wife on television!”) People say things like “be careful who you trust!” and “he’s backpack boy … his girlfriend is carrying him over the finish line”. You don’t get this sort of feuding on Ninja Warrior, that’s for sure.As is de rigueur, contestants are shamelessly milked for their personal tragedies. Within minutes, we learn that one participant wishes to use the prize money for a relative’s cancer treatment; later, we hear of people wanting a better life for their families, or looking for funds to help cure rare diseases. But, really, Beast Games doesn’t feel any more cloying than any other series of its ilk, or indeed Donaldson’s own online efforts to helpamputeeswalk again, orcure 1,000 people’s blindness. Strangely, though, it has an immaturity running through it that quickly reminds me of my teenage years. Two players, Jim and Monika, immediately become an item (“shall we make it official?!”), while Luisitin makes it his mission to get another player kicked off the show as quickly as possible, by getting the others to ignore him during a challenge called Bluff, where players have to work out what colour disc they have attached to the backs of their heads. Initially, I thought that Beast City – the show’s heavily floodlit set, where the 200 contestants live and compete – is a bit like a prison, albeit if prisons had their own 24-hour branches of Starbucks. Slowly, I realise it is more like high school.This season, MrBeast and friends have split the contestants up into two teams, Strong and Smart, playing once again into an adolescent view of the world. Perhaps unsurprisingly, as the challenges become more physical, more of the “smart” team (among them, Trina, who – we are told – has the same IQ as Einstein) begin to fail. What this segregation is supposed to prove is anyone’s guess (people who self-select as strong are better at athletic challenges?!), although in Beast City the aim may simply be to divide and conquer. Players are offered cash bribes to leave the game, which is all well and good until you realise that they may also be getting other people booted out in the process.MrBeast attracts a lot of attention for his questionable online antics: this is a man who made his name doing things likelocking people in isolation for 100 days. By that token, Beast Games isn’t particularly controversial. It is, however, prodigiously childish. As well as a rictus grin, Donaldson sports a blazer over a hoodie for the duration of the series, which is deeply unflattering and also a metaphor for his contest. As much as it hopes to smarten up its act, Beast Games feels like the TV equivalent of the sad Christmas fair where an ailing horse is given some antlers and told to look lively. It is fairly cruel, sure, but it’s also incredibly turgid – and maybe that’s worse.Beast Games is on Prime Video now.Explore more on these topicsTelevision & radioTV reviewTelevisionreviewsShareReuse this content"

I had to find all the pieces of me, scattered all around, and put them back together, one by one.” Following a cardiac arrest which left him clinically dead for 40 minutes, Jago Trevarno, the young narrator of Patrick Charnley’s moving debut novel, has retreated to the Cornish village where he grew up, to shelter under the protection of his “off-gridder” uncle, Jacob.His mother dead of cancer and his father long gone, at 20 Jago’s world seems to have shrunk to nothing but the hard daily labour of working a subsistence farm high above the rugged Atlantic coast. The life Jago had begun to construct in the city, “a runaway train” in flight from his mother’s death and everything that reminded him of her, has evaporated abruptly in the aftermath of his near-death experience. He has “gone from someone who needed to slow down, to be present, to someone having no choice about it”, and must start from scratch.The building blocks available to Jago are basic. His injury has left him with “reduced processing power”: his brain’s responses are slow and have to remain so, calibrated for recovery. He is also in marked retreat from intense emotion, wary of the havoc it could wreak in his vulnerable synapses, and Jacob – kindly, protective and understanding but taciturn, unused to company – exerts only minimal emotional counterpressure.Together uncle and nephew live a life of extreme simplicity, their days governed by the weather, the animals, the seasons and the hours of daylight. But while this extraordinarily circumscribed and stable existence may be the perfect environment for his immediate recovery, as Jago’s condition improves the inevitable question arises as to whether he can live indefinitely in this sort of stasis, in hiding from the past and the outside world. And then the outside world takes matters into its own hands, because even an off-gridder has neighbours, well-meaning or otherwise – and sooner or later they make their presence felt.The prose is spare and beautiful, the narrative simple but sound – it is as finely wrought as poetryOn the benign side of the scale is Granny Carne, fierce and fiercely independent, loyal to Jago and Jacob, seer and holder of everyone’s secrets. And then there is Sophie. Jago’s first love, abandoned in the turbulent wake of his mother’s death, Sophie has never left the village, and her renewed presence in Jago’s life, along with the raft of painful feelings she evokes, inevitably begins to endanger his precarious hold on emotional stability.It is the notorious Bill Sligo, though, whose land sits above Jacob’s and whose brand-new Range Rover definitely wasn’t bought from farming profits, who presents the greatest threat to the life Jago is trying to rebuild. Sligo has his eye on one of Jacob’s fields, where the entry to an old mineshaft sits above a honeycomb of tunnels and caves – and when it begins to look as though he will go to any lengths to get it, Jago must decide whether to retreat or to engage.This, My Second Life is prefaced with a brief statement of the author’s own experience of cardiac arrest and brain injury. The son of the late and brilliant writer Helen Dunmore, Charnley has also lost a mother relatively young to cancer, yet to see the novel through the lens of personal trauma would be to do it a grave injustice. The prose is spare and beautiful, the narrative simple but sound – it is as finely wrought as poetry, luminous with Jago’s sheer delight in the world, electric with his fear that it might still at any moment be snatched away. The hypnotically seductive rhythms of days filled with only the most immediate things – the smell of a library or the colours of the sea, the “milky winter sun” or the exquisite savour of plain food – are layered to achieve a piercing intensity, the world made new. And as he details his own limitations and his meticulous efforts to navigate them, Jago’s distinctive voice emerges, a true and clear and entirely convincing creation, always reaching towards the light and life.This, My Second Life by Patrick Charnley is published by Hutchinson Heinemann (£16.99).

But the statistic is correct: while the Milky Way isestimatedto have roughly 200bn stars, Russia has something in the region of642bntrees. Stretching from the Arctic tundra to central Asia to the Pacific Ocean, the Russian forest is vast, mighty and inhospitable. Yet while it is a source of potential danger, it is also a place of great beauty and potential riches, providing furs, minerals and rivers overflowing with salmon.Pinkham, a professor of comparative literature at Cornell University whose last book explored the intricacies of post-Soviet Ukraine, here charts the landscape’s influence on the Russian psyche, and its imprint on history, society and literature. The forest is deeply entwined with Russian national identity – the country is often symbolically represented as a bear – yet attitudes towards it have fluctuated. Different leaders have proposed different strategies for extracting value from the land, leading to cycles of deforestation and tree-planting depending on whether the priority was boosting agriculture, building Peter the Great’s imperial fleet, extracting minerals or constructing hydroelectric dams. Politically, it has been a place of resistance and of ultranationalist rhetoric glorifying the idea of Russian self-sufficiency.As well as being an ideological battleground, the forest in Russia has frequently been a literal one. From the 13th-century Mongol invasion of Kievan Rus to the current conflict in Ukraine, military success or defeat has often depended on an understanding of the forest, whether to aid in tracking enemy combatants or to avoid detection. During the second world war, partisan fighters “found their greatest ally in the forests”: they hid in the trees and sabotaged German supply lines, while helping an estimated 25,000 Jewish people escape into the woods.The forest always offers some combination of nourishment and danger, freedom and entrapmentAs we learned in Richard Powers’ tree-centred novel The Overstory, a forest will inevitably end up being partly defined by the people who pass through it. Pinkham gives a comprehensive account of the ways writers, poets and artists have looked to the forest for meaning: Pushkin’s romanticised visions of mountain societies in the Caucasus; Tolstoy’s forest-inspired epiphanies (on encountering an oak in War and Peace, Prince Andrei “realises that he should live more like a forest – in inter­connection with all the beings around him, giving and receiving”); Andrei Tarkovsky’s cinematic depictions of spectral, quasi-divine trees. In the mid-1800s, writers and intellectuals devoted themselves to protesting deforestation and emancipating the serfs, two causes that became closely interlinked.Colourful characters abound, from the heavily tattooed environmental activist Andrei Khristoforov, who wore angel wings and self-identified as a tree, to the Lykov family, members of a religious sect who lived undetected in the taiga for decades, gaining notoriety after their existence was revealed. In 2004, an elderly man in Novgorod oblast erected a monument to the potato, which saved many Russians from starvation during the economic deprivation of the 1990s. The customs of indigenous populations, such as the Khanty people’s ceremonies that involve skinning a bear, are recounted sensitively and with respect.Pinker’s prose is spare, precise, becoming more evocative in passages about flora and fauna. Her love of animals is evident in her descriptions of them: a lynx “danc[es] on the edge of [a] motorboat, his tufted ears moving in response to the sounds of the water and the rustling trees”; wolf cubs are “skinny, big-eyed, and innocent … nibbling leaves and bark and each other”. The forest murmurs, sings, makes music, whispers.Like the taiga, the book’s structure is somewhat sprawling. While the order is broadly chronological and geographical, some of the jumps can be jarring, especially in the early sections (lyrical chapter titles such as Tigers Listen to Water Talk don’t shed much light on the matter). This is a meander through the woods, rather than a straight path. There is at times an excess of places and names, though an extensive knowledge of Russian history isn’t a prerequisite. By its nature, the narrative ends up being somewhat repetitive: the forest offers some combination of nourishment and danger, freedom and entrapment.Overall, the book makes a compelling argument for the forest as a prism through which to understand Russia – including the former Soviet space – and its peoples. The climate crisis looms ominously: a 2021 wildfire burned an area twice the size of Ireland. But the forest is remarkably resilient, whether to war or human interference or nuclear disaster (in the Chornobyl “zone of exclusion”, a natural rewilding has occurred, bringing with it bison, lynx and bears). It may be a mistake, Pinkham suggests, to apply a human timeframe to this ecosystem; an oak can live for more than 1,000 years, outlasting any despotic dynasty. “Do you know how many Putins there have been in our time?” one activist says. “Go into the woods, hide, don’t stick your head out, and wait.”The Oak and the Larch: A Forest History of Russia and Its Empires by Sophie Pinkham is published by William Collins (£25).

It’s not clear if thehit 2001 Hong Kong TV series A Step Into the Past– about a modern-day cop transported to the third-century BC “warring states” period – was seen as an offender. But it is evidently all go for Chinese time-travel movies now, and hence this glossy cinematic reprise of A Step Into the Past that picks up the main characters 20 years on.Louis Koo returns as former policeman Hong Siu Lung, still trapped in the Qin dynasty and lying low with his family after putting his disciple Chiu Poon (Raymond Lam) on the throne. Back in the present, the time machine’s inventor Ken (Michael Miu Kiu-wai) has just been released from a prison stretch for botching the technology and marooning Hong. He maintains it is unfair, but he doesn’t muck about with a grievance procedure; he goes full Vader and resolves to head back and become Qin emperor himself.The film proceeds at a nippy pace, with some larky sections, but directors Jack Lai and Yuen Fai Ng don’t take it in the expected direction, which would be an anachronism-hugging comedy of manners à la Les Visiteurs or Back to the Future. Ken blowing everyone’s minds, and the Qin footsoldier ranks, with 21st-century ordnance is about as subtle as it gets in what amounts to an extended chase sequence after the emperor. There are some passable sequences, such as a cart-borne escape down a hillside tea plantation. But the fight choreography is rote gun-fu – surprisingly, as it’s overseen by old master Sammo Hung – and often chopped into restrictive closeups.Worse, the soapy convolutions of the story take on an increasingly sententious tone, with Ken’s betrayed daughter (Baihe Bai) becoming a mouthpiece for lectures on megalomania and history. And Lam’s cold-eyed tyrant is too often asked to flip dutifully back into the character of Hong’s misty-eyed ward, especially when a callback montage to the original show is looming. A Step Into the Past diehards might appreciate this trip down the warphole, but nostalgia is far too basic a technology for most people these days.Back to the Past is in UK and Irish cinemas now.Explore more on these topicsFilmScience fiction and fantasy filmsPeriod and historical filmsChinaTelevisionHong KongAsia PacificreviewsShareReuse this content"

Jim Henson’s fantasy adventure mixes human actors, unmistakably Hensonian puppet creatures, and one authentic legend who goes beyond either category:David Bowie as Jareth, the spikily coiffured king of the goblins, towering over the diminutive figures the way he might if he’d been a guest on The Muppet Show. He carries off this wacky role with absolute commitment and good humour.Labyrinth also features cherubic teen Jennifer Connelly as Sarah, a girl who is infuriated at being made to look after her baby half-brother Toby when her dad and stepmom are out for the evening. In a fit of loneliness and pique, influenced by a fairytale she has been reading called The Labyrinth, and perhaps unable to process the psychological reasons for her resentment of baby Toby, Sarah makes a spiteful wish that goblins take the infant away. This they do, and Sarah is faced with a daunting quest: she must somehow get through the labyrinth that surrounds Jareth’s castle and wrest the poor child from his awful grasp.Labyrinth is obviously influenced by Lewis Carroll: Sarah has very Alice-type encounters with conceited and talkative creatures who have a tendency to make quibbling, riddling demands on her – and she falls weightlessly down holes. The film also takes a good deal fromMaurice Sendak’s Where the Wild Things Are, a book that is glimpsed in an early scene, and Sendak is explicitly thanked in the credits. There is a rather amazing hallucinatory sequence at the end in which Sarah confronts Jareth directly, which is taken from MC Escher. But watched again, we can perhaps see how Labyrinth might have been a subconscious influence on someone else, an author who had vaguely registered some details: along with the goblins there are owls flying mysteriously about, and a certain goblin called Hoggle is wrongly addressed as “Hogwart”.This is a very analogue-era movie with analogue-type storytelling and dialogue: it is not driven with the same hyperactive focused energy that modern Pixar/Disney films have. The action often ambles and dawdles and the dialogue, written by Terry Jones, has a casually constructed but often very funny humour. A year later, Rob Reiner would give usThe Princess Bride, which is comparable in some ways. But this is utterly unique whimsy and fun.Labyrinth is in UK cinemas from 9 January, and in Australian cinemas from 22 January.Explore more on these topicsFilmScience fiction and fantasy filmsAnimation in filmDavid BowiereviewsShareReuse this content"

Tosser’s Pot leads to Cutpurse, then from Pokes Alley to Kiphouse Row. For the residents of the inner-city tenement building where the action opens in 1880, choices are starkly circumscribed and lives are cut short by poverty, disease or violence.Covering 100 years of life in this house, the narrative traces four families, their lives intertwined through generations, with trauma recurring – to women in particular – echoing the spirit of Seán O’Casey. The historical backdrop is outlined in broad brush: from strikes in the slums to revolution and war, through the early years of the independent state, to the heroin and HIV-Aids crises of the 1980s.Bergin creates a thread through time in the character of the spirited Honor Gately (Sarah Morris), a sex worker determined to defy her circumstances as “a feculent wench”, whose great-granddaughter, also played compellingly by Morris, breaks old patterns and starts to write a novel.View image in fullscreenLives intertwined through generations … Dublin Gothic.Photograph: Ros KavanaghHonor’s “blubberpus” son (Thommas Kane Byrne) brings gleeful comedy to the role of an accidental patriot in the 1916 Easter Rising. His is one of a number of historical characters conflated by Bergin to pointedly anti-heroic effect: we meet loosely emblematic incarnations of James Joyce, Pádraig Pearse and Brendan Behan, as well as a Bob Geldof/Bono-like singer. A rogues’ gallery of abusive, duplicitous or pathetic men – politicians, priests, wastrel writers – flashes past, with subtlety sacrificed to narrative momentum.With a dynamic ensemble cast of 19 on stage throughout, the storytelling is elaborate, expansive – and sometimes smothering. Functioning as a constantly shifting chorus taking turns to narrate the plot, the multitalented actors are in a whirlwind of exposition and costume changes, playing more than 120 characters in three-and-a-half hours.With so much narrative to cram in, the form often hampers the scope for director Caroline Byrne to do more than manoeuvre the cast around Jamie Vartan’s imposing set. Creating a cross-section of the building, the stacked design offers dramatic possibilities, not fully realised. Despite the ambitious scale, commitment and punchy energy of this production, its teeming canvas leaves little room for new insights.AtAbbey theatre, Dublin, until 31 JanuaryExplore more on these topicsTheatreAbbey theatreIrelandreviewsShareReuse this content"

He was a populist pioneer and genuine visionary who created London’s Young Vic theatre from scratch, radically changed the nature of the Edinburgh festival and, at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, tried to introduce institutional permanence to New York theatre. He was also a figure of bustling energy. Even in his 90s, when I would see him on his annual return to Edinburgh, he would be talking about future projects. In fact, he reminded me of a line from a great Latin poet: “Leisure, Catullus, does not agree with you.”TheYoung Vicis his enduring legacy but one forgets what an extraordinary achievement it was in 1970. It was a breeze block building created in nine months out of a former butcher’s shop, and was inspired by Dunlop’s memories of the postwar dream of a theatre centre operating under the auspices of the Old Vic. Dunlop’s Young Vic had a similar relation to Olivier’s National Theatre parent company, but it soon established its own identity. Offering lively productions to young audiences at affordable prices, it mixed classics by Shakespeare and Molière with the best of Beckett, Ionesco and Genet.View image in fullscreenDunlop with the Who’s Pete Townshend in 1971.Photograph: Evening Standard/Getty ImagesNicky Henson, a key member of Dunlop’s team and a fine Jimmy Porter in Look Back in Anger, once told me that the Young Vic company was essentially Dunlop’s surrogate family. I saw the truth of that a few years ago when I got a call from him inviting me to a tea party in Soho to mark a significant Young Vic anniversary. Around the table were original members of the company includingRonald Pickup, Andrew Robertson,Cleo Sylvestre, Anna Carteret and Annabel Leventon. Quite spontaneously people would get up and tell stories of the Young Vic in its early days. Ron Pickup, who had played Oedipus, recalled Olivier coming to see it and telling him afterwards: “Ron, you are a highly promising young actor playing the lead in one of the greatest plays in world drama in the most beautiful new theatre in London. So why the fuck couldn’t I understand a word you were saying?” As Ron told this self-deprecating story, Frank chuckled in the corner like an affectionate father.Because he was such an innovator, one forgets  he was also a very good directorDunlop went on to run the Edinburgh festival from 1984 to 1991, and totally altered its character. Under previous directors, drama had always been a poor relation of classical music and opera, but Frank reversed the roles. He gave us a series of international theatre seasons including visits from Sweden’s Ingmar Bergman, Poland’s Andrzej Wajda, Spain’s Victor Garcia and Germany’s Manfred Wekwerth and Joachim Tenschert. But perhaps his greatest coup, aided by Thelma Holt, was to introduce the Japanese masterYukio Ninagawato British audiences. I still rate his cherry-blossom Macbeth as one of the most beautiful productions I’ve ever seen, but it was followed by Ninagawa’s equally striking productions of Medea, The Tempest and a contemporary play, Tango at the End of Winter.Dunlop was more diplomatic with visiting companies than with local politicians, and caused fury with the council when the idea of alternating the festival between Glasgow and Edinburgh was seriously mooted. But for a journalist, he was always good copy – not least when publicly suggesting that the fringe had become “smug and self-satisfied”.View image in fullscreenDirecting Jim Dale in his breakthrough role in Scapino in 1971.Photograph: Evening Standard/Getty ImagesBecause he was such an innovator, one forgets that he was also a very good director, and two of his productions reveal his capacity for nursing great performances into being. In 1971, while working for the NationalTheatrecompany at the Old Vic, he directed Carl Zuckmayer’s picaresque fable The Captain of Köpenick, which shows a former prisoner acquiring a new persona the second he dons a soldier’s uniform. The play got a great performance from Paul Scofield, whose slack-jointed knees looked as if they could barely support the fragile load they were asked to carry, but it was Dunlop who provided the essential framework.In 1974 John Wood gave a similarly virtuosic performance in an RSC Sherlock Holmes, but again it was Dunlop who caught the unabashed theatrical vigour of William Gillette’s close-shaven adaptation of Conan Doyle.There were many other aspects to Dunlop’s varied career: he was the original director of Joseph and the Amazing Technicolour Dreamcoat, the creator of Pop Theatre for whom he staged The Winter’s Tale and The Trojan Women, the man who turned Jim Dale into a Broadway star in Scapino, and who later directed Delphine Seyrig in Antony and Cleopatra. Because of his restless energy and reluctance to stay too long in one place – rather like a modern-day Tyrone Guthrie – Dunlop was undervalued, but if only for the creation of the Young Vic he would demand a permanent place in theatrical history.Explore more on these topicsTheatreYoung VicfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Not because I doubt Rosalía’s virtuosic talents or her intense intellectual curiosity, but because the album’s promotional campaign had already done too much work on my nerves. The rollout was relentless:thirsty reelsteasing the album on social media, fashion-forward mysticism, even bringing Madrid’s city centreto a halt– everything about it felt designed to send the message that this is less a set of songs than a global event demanding reverence.Over the past decade, Rosalía has become Spain’s biggest pop export, and Lux appears to inaugurate her imperial phase. The album debuted at No 1 in five countries, was votedthe Guardian’s album of the year, broke streaming recordson Spotify, and reached No 4 in the US and UK charts, where non-anglophone pop rarely thrives. Multilingual and stylistically expansive, Lux is saturated with Catholic iconography, with lyrics in no fewer than 13 languages, and circling themes of transcendence, suffering and grace.None of this is unprecedented in pop music, but the album’s atmosphere of luxury, and framing of spiritual transcendence as a premium experience, sits poorly during a cost of living crisis, especially when the Vatican has been unusually direct recently in itscriticism of inequality, economic excess, and the moral alibis of wealth.“Why is she doing nun-corenow?” I grumbled, watching Rosalía iron her clothes in the video for first singleBerghain, flanked by an imposing chorus and orchestra. A revival of (conspicuously white) national-Catholic aesthetics seems like the last thing the world needs, especially laundered through someone with Rosalía’s reach. Her ascent has made her a one-woman soft-power campaign for Spanish culture, the undisputed sovereign ofla Marca España(Brand Spain, a government initiative) on the global pop stage.View image in fullscreenLux by Rosalía.Photograph: APAnd yet, once I spent time with the record, and the PR fog began to clear, it became obvious that Lux is doing something more interesting and unsettling than lavish ecclesiastical pop. Beneath the bombast and heavy-handed symbolism lies not a sermon but an inquiry into what it means to inhabit a world of unravelling assumptions.Crisis today is no longer just a temporary moment of exception, but an all-encompassing condition – a point driven home in 2022 when the Collins Dictionary named “permacrisis” its word of the year. Daily life is saturated with moral urgency, and our values are perpetually “under threat”. The cataloguing of plagues – genocide, war, climate breakdown, inflation, displacement – now feels less like diagnosis and more like content tagging for the almighty algorithm. It was precisely this convergence of uncertainty and moralising that sociologist Ronald Inglehart studied for decades. He argued that existential insecurity pushes societies toward authoritarianism: to the upholding of traditional power hierarchies, moral rigidity, religious sanctimony and the patriarchal social order.Spain is no exception. Over the past decade, a constellation of ultra-conservative actors has moved from the margins to the centre of public life, largely via digital tools. These groups operate as “moral entrepreneurs”: politically savvy and highly mobilised, they frame themselves as embattled defenders of life, order and truth against a hostile secular world. When I first loaded Rosalía’s Berghain video on YouTube, the advertisement before it played was from the Spanish bishops’ conference, titledYou too can be a saint– quietly confirming that sanctity, too, is now delivered algorithmically.These forces feed off a Spanish rage-bait cycle of high-levelcorruption scandalsand judicialpoliticisation. The buzzword here recently (as it is elsewhere) is “polarisation”, but the folk history behind it is that of the civil war betweenlasdos Españas(the two Spains): red versus black,NacionalesvRepublicanos, Cain v Abel. Rosalía, however, wants to elevate her gaze from such a binary worldview and study the whole in all its contradictions.View image in fullscreenRosalía makes a surprise appearance to promote her album, Lux, at Callao Square in Madrid on 20 October 2025.Photograph: Juanjo Martin/EPALux opens not with a declaration, but with a desire: to live between the two (“Quién pudiera vivir entre los dos”), loving both God and the Earth’s hedonic pleasures. It is far from an accident.Rosalíamust be one of very few global pop stars who conscientiously conducts scholarly research before songwriting: indeed her breakthrough 2018 album El Mal Querer doubled as her thesis at the Escola Superior de Música de Catalunya, and received academic honours. That intellectualism carries through to Lux. Doubling as an archive of female mystics, each song draws on figures such as Saint Teresa of Ávila, Rabia al-Adawiyya, Sun Bu’er or Hildegard von Bingen – women for whom devotion, authority, eroticism and transcendence were never neatly separable.Lux is exhilarating in its refusal to settle. Reliquia, the album’s globetrotting second track, twists spritely strings and vocal snippets into unrecognisable shapes before bursting into ecstatic rhythms. When Rosalía sings “No soy una santa, pero estoyblessed” (“I’m not a saint, but I am blessed”), the line lands with the deliberate thud of heretical subversion: divinisation without ascent. This is one of the “abominable heresies” for which the 17th-century philosopher Baruch Spinoza was excommunicated from both Judaism andCatholicism. Writing in the long shadow of the Inquisition that shaped his family’s forced conversion and exile, he proposed that God and nature are one and the same: that there is no hierarchy, no outside – only a single, endlessly differentiating “substance”.At its most compelling, Lux projects its dense religious themes on to a maximalist sonic palette, where the sacred is not opposed to the profane, but crowded with it. In Divinize, Rosalía finds liberation not through escape from the body but through deeper entanglement within it. On Porcelana, fragility, fear and ferocity drive a constantly evolving tension. “Ego sum nihil/ego sum lux mundi” (“I am nothing/I am the light of the world”) she sings in Latin, softly punctuated by simmering flamenco clapping – an alchemy as powerful as anything I’ve heard this year.These are the moments when Lux comes into focus, when easy dualities are gradually unpacked to reveal a multitude: not two opposed forces at opposite ends of a spectrum, but countless cohabiting ones in constant tension. This is evident in the album’s sprawling liner notes and production credits, Rosalía’s singular talents pushed forward through careful collaboration.It is not a perfect album: the more traditional pieces occasionally veer into excess or preciousness, and its avoidance of politics can feel less principled than insulated – at a moment when reactionary, inquisitorial projects are no longer marginal but enjoy direct access to power. Still, Lux gestures toward something more demanding than simple resolution: in the chorus of album highlight La Yugular, an all-encompassing love swells until it abolishes heaven and hell alike. The song ends with Rosalía collapsing scale again and again (“the entire galaxy fits in a drop of saliva”), to reveal the self as a site of both immensity and compression, where the strain of containing multitudes within a single body carries its own spiritual charge.Carlos Delclós is a sociologist and writer based in BarcelonaExplore more on these topicsRosalíaOpinionCatholicismChristianityReligionSpainEuropeLanguagecommentShareReuse this content"

So where better to head at this time of year, when our happiness levels are traditionally at their lowest ebb? Striding across the rolling chalkland towards the teetering sea cliffs buoyed up by a stiff breeze is the perfect antidote to the January blues. And if there’s a cosy hotel bar with an open fire waiting for you at the end of the walk, so much the better.The Alfriston, on the edge of the Sussex village of the same name, reopened under new owners last spring. Housed in a red-brick manor house, parts of which date back to the 14th century, its new look nods to the Arts and Crafts movement with attractive block-printed wallpapers, patterned furnishings and wood panelling painted in warm colours.There’s a long front lawn laid out for games of croquet, skittles and pétanque but the jewel in the crown is the 10-metre outdoor pool, heated and open year-round. After a swim, warm up in the sauna or steam room or treat yourself to a massage or beauty treatment in the small spa area. On a Saturday evening the 1554 Brasserie was lively with a mix of guests and locals and the menu had something to please all palates – from slow-roasted Norfolk cauliflower (£18 for a main) to haunch of fallow deer with chestnuts and cacao sauce (£28). My starter of scallops followed by grilled whole sea bass with samphire was excellent. After a deep sleep we woke up to views across the mist-shrouded downs and breakfast in the Orangery, where the walls are hand-painted with delicate murals of trees and flowers.

The hotel’s interiors, with grand staircase and ornate ceilings, have been injected with eye-catching colours and a swirl of patterns by designer Isabella Worsley. The best-value rooms are here in the main building, with cute treehouse-style wooden hives tucked into the 35 acres of grounds should you feel more flush.Just down the hill is the Coach House, home to a small spa offering botanical facials, reflexology and massage, a yoga studio, gym and sauna. This is where you’ll also find the map room, stocking everything you need to plan a day out, and complimentary bikes. We headed out on the blessedly flat 13-mile Tissington Trail, which runs along the old Ashbourne to Buxton railway line. It was an easy ride but we still felt entirely justified in demolishing an enormous shared platter of seafood misto in the buzzy restaurant, with its curved bar and artificial olive trees.Doubles from £157 room-only,wildhive.ukJane KnightThe Cliff Hotel & Spa, Cardigan BayView image in fullscreenThe Cliff Hotel overlooks the grand sweep of Cardigan Bay.Photograph: Gavin Haskell/AlamyBlow away any lingering Christmas cobwebs at this breezy coastal retreat on a headland above the grand sweep of Cardigan Bay. From the lobby to the restaurant and 76 guest rooms, the style throughout is slick and contemporary, with soothing shades of grey, green and blue reflecting the Atlantic views framed by the huge picture windows.There’s plenty to do here: go for a walk along the Ceredigion coast path (keep your eyes peeled for bottlenose dolphins and seals); have a round of golf at the hotel’s own nine-hole course; watch the surfers battling the swells at nearby Poppit Sands; or head into Cardigan for a mooch around the castle and shops.Soak away winter chills in the hotel’s underground spa, which has a hydrotherapy pool, steam room, sauna, hot tub and gym, and offers a range of good-value treatments from facials to algae wraps and hot stone massage (from around £70 for a 50-minute treatment).

The quiet appeal of the location is mirrored indoors. A woodburner in reception makes you feel instantly at home, while beyond lies a relaxed sequence of spaces: a comfy seating area, the restaurant and bar with wooden floors, banquettes and modern art, and the Orangery dining room.The 45 bedrooms, arranged in two storeys around an appealing courtyard, come with boldly coloured fabric headboards and patterned paper (pick one on the first floor for a quieter night). After checking mine out, I set off to circumnavigate the 23-mile reservoir by bike, earning the excellent bistro meal that awaited my return, including the hotel’s signature tempura cauliflower popcorn.The Barnsdale offers superb value, but there’s still a pleasing spirit of generosity. If dry January isn’t your thing, there’s a complimentary 4pm drink in the bar as well as a nightcap. Massages are sensibly priced (£90 for 60 minutes) and you have unfettered access to the sauna, hot tub and outdoor pool from midday on arrival until the same time on departure, without paying extra. It’s civilised and faintly indulgent, all for just north of £100 a night.Doubles from £125 B&B (£105 on Sundays),barnsdalerutland.comJane KnightDunkeld House Hotel, PerthshireView image in fullscreenThe approach to this elegant, white country house hotel couldn’t be dreamier, a speed-bump-controlled crawl through sweeping, tree-studded parkland, a bronze stag guarding the doorway. Bedded above the fast-flowing River Tay, on the edge of the historic village of Dunkeld (a mile-long meander along the riverside path) it was built at the end of the 19th century as a summer retreat for the 7th Duke of Atholl.Today, it’s a relaxed and welcoming hotel (help yourself to a dram of whisky or glass of sherry) with a roaring log fire in the wood-panelled reception, muted tartan carpets and a smattering of taxidermy, including a mighty stag’s head lording it over the grand staircase.Book a room with a tree-fringed river view: for a treat, the Duchess suite has a balcony, parquet flooring, art deco styling and gold-trimmed bathroom. The spa has a pool and indoor hot tub looking over plant-peppered gardens and offers ishga Hebridean seaweed treatments, hot stone massages, detoxifying seaweed wraps and restorative facials.

Go for a walk in the grounds – there are printed maps for guests – or indulge in a treatment in the small Elemis spa (treatments from £60 for 25 minutes), which also has a pool, steam room and gym.In the smart dining room, the seasonally-adjusted menu runs the gamut from homemade gnocchi with butternut squash and black garlic (£18.50) to pan-fried wood pigeon breast with game and pearl barley ragout (£28.50).

I had a couple of carrots and a piece of squash that needed saving, so I turned them into a golden kraut with ginger, turmeric and a little orange zest for brightness. Use whatever you have to hand and let the ingredients lead your creativity.Fridge raid sauerkrautFermenting is an enjoyable way to make the most of a seasonal ingredient or to use up surplus produce. At our restaurant, whenever we had a glut that needed using up, we used to rely on fermentation, because not only did it saves us money in the long term, it also helped us to create imaginative, delicious new products to cook with.Classic cabbage kraut is, of course, glorious, but there are all manner of alternatives, and some magic combinations. Just get creative, use what you have and eat the rainbow. As with classic sauerkraut, the general rule of thumb is that you need about 3% salt to the total weight of vegetables.Now, just a few notes on fermentation in general. Keep the jar out of direct sunlight and check on it every day. Give it some love, and a stir, perhaps, and make sure the ingredients are always submerged in the liquid (a fermentation weight will help here, as would any other clean weight). Only use organic unwaxed citrus zest, because conventional citrus tends to be subjected to very high levels of fungicides and pesticides.Finally, if you’re new to fermenting, maybe consider making two jars: keep one in the fridge and leave the other to ferment on the counter, then taste both over time to teach your tastebuds how the flavour of each develops as it matures. You will need a large sterilised jar with a lid.Makes1 x 500g jar400g mixed hard vegetables(carrot, squash, beetroot, kohlrabi, turnip, radish, celeriac, broccoli stems – any combination you like), all washed and grated or finely sliced12g sea saltOptional extrasFinely grated zest of 1 unwaxed organic lemon or ½ orange, to taste1-3 tsp grated fresh ginger, to taste1 small piecefresh turmeric, or 1 tsp ground turmeric (this will dye the food yellow)1-2 tsp caraway, cumin or coriander seeds, whole or ground, to tasteTip the grated vegetables into a large bowl, scatter over the salt, then add any of the optional extras that you fancy. Mix everything with your hands, and massage firmly for a few minutes, until the vegetables start to soften and release their juices.Spoon the mixture into a large sterilised jar, press it down tightly, then pour in any brine from the bottom of the bowl and firmly push the vegetables beneath the liquid; if they aren’t fully submerged, top up with a splash of filtered water mixed with a tiny pinch of salt.Place the lid loosely on top of the jar – this will allow the gases to escape – then leave at room temperature for at least four days, checking regularly until it’s bubbling and the brine tastes lightly acidic. If you prefer a deeper, more complex flavour, keep it fermenting it on the counter for longer. Otherwise, for a milder kraut, seal and put in the fridge, where it will keep for four to six months.Explore more on these topicsFoodWaste notFood wastePickling, fermenting and preservingVegetablesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The lentils cook down into a smooth, golden blend, their gentle sweetness enriched by sauteed onions, garlic and a touch of spice. A drizzle of dukkah oil brightens things up, making it perfect for January. Then, a Levantine chickpea stew with aubergine and tahini, which is so nourishing and full of flavour. Tender chickpeas simmer slowly in a rich tomato base until they absorb the sweetness of onions, garlic, and the gentle warmth of cumin. Fried aubergine melts into the stew, and its smoky softness gives each spoonful a lush texture.Red lentil soup with dukkah oil (pictured top)As the dukkah oil mingles with the soup, it releases an earthy aroma: nutty, citrussy and softly spiced.
