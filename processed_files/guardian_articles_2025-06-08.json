But she was also a fantasist who couldn’t be bothered to spend time raising meWhen Fear of Flying, her autobiographical novel about women’s sexual desires, came out in 1973, Erica Jong was suddenly big news. But growing up as her only child, I had a very different experienceMolly Jong-FastSun 8 Jun 2025 07.00 EDTShareIn August 1978, I was born in a hospital in Stamford, Connecticut. I came out with red hair. This was proof to my mother that I was special. The fantasy of my specialness continued my entire life. I was special even though I was dyslexic. I was special even though I got kicked out of college. I was special even though I was a drug addict. I was special despite my fatness. I was special despite all the evidence to the contrary. I was special because I was a piece of her.I read an interview with my mother in which the interviewer described me as a “stout” toddler. “Stout” means “kind of fat”. I never thought of a toddler as being able to be fat, but there it was.This is from that interview in the Washington Post: “Their daughter, Molly Miranda Jong-Fast, is two years old and red-headed. She was born between pages 284 and 285 of Fanny. Having the baby, Jong says, ‘transformed’ her. ‘In my 20s and early 30s I didn’t think I wanted children,’ she says. ‘But by the time I was 34 or 35, I realised that if I didn’t have a baby soon, it was going to be a matter of picking up every stray dog in Connecticut.’”I always wondered if she would have been better off with a dog.My mother isthe writer Erica Jong. She is a novelist, essayist and poet. She has published 27 books, the most famous of which is her autobiographical novelFear of Flying. It came out in 1973, five years before I was born, and is considered, in some corners at least, a landmark of feminist literature. Its candid depiction of women’s sexual desires was extremely shocking at the time. It has sold more than 20m copies, andJohn Updikecompared it to The Catcher in the Rye andPortnoy’s Complaint.Fear of Flyingmade her very famous, for a writer. She was a guest onThe Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson. She was on the cover of Newsweek.Gore Vidal and Henry Millerwere friends. I’m not here to brag about my mother’s friendships with dead writers. But a lot of younger people have no idea who she is.My mother coined an expression for casual sex: the “zipless fuck”. Now think about being the offspring of the person who wrote that sentence. And pour one out for me.I grew up with her everywhere – on television, in the crossword puzzle, in the newspaper. Mom was a kind of second-wave feminist, a white feminist, and an (highly educated, wildly affluent, Jewish and somewhat out-of-touch) everywoman. But she wasn’t an actual everywoman, of course; she was too famous for that. Too famous, and too special. She was famous for that book, then later she was famous for being famous, and then eventually she wasn’t famous any more. Because fame, like youth, is fleeting; it deserts you when you least expect it. The wheel of fortune is always spinning.Inever thought of myself as the star of my own life, or my own childhood. From a young age, I knew my mom was writing about me. I knew it because people would come up to me and ask me very personal questions, which meant that they knew things about me they couldn’t possibly know unless someone was telling them. I never knew quite what the other person knew about me. In some ways, it made me very good at talking to people; in other ways, it made me a psychopath. I never had privacy, so I never valued privacy. I just assumed everyone knew everything about me and about everyone else.When I was a kid, my mother published a children’s picture book about me because of course she did. She told me she wrote Megan’s Book of Divorceto help me deal with her divorce from my father. It’s a crazy piece of work. A blog called Awful Library Bookshad some fun with it, referencing, among other transgressions, something called “the bizarre underwear scene”. In the scene in question, I (or “Megan”) am not wearing underwear. I’m kneeling before my toy box and appear to be fellating a stuffed dog (naturally, I’m looking for my missing underwear). I am given the line, “I think divorce is dumb because I never remember where I left my underpants.” The publishers liked the butt drawing so much, they also put it on the back cover.View image in fullscreenErica and Molly in 2011.Photograph: Tim KnoxThis is not the only problem with the book. There is the reflexive racism (one of Megan’s nannies, Bessie-Lou, has “healin’ hands” and takes young Megan “to meet her pastor in Harlem. Hallelujah!”). There is the fact that Megan wants her mother to kill her stepmother. There are continuity issues, there is the ever-present Erica Jong problem of unexamined privilege, but the most obvious and tragic problem: the author of the book seems to have about as much familiarity with children as she would with extraterrestrials from Mars.Believe it or not, my mom sold the film rights to this picture book to ABC. A pilot was shot. They changed the title to Sambecause my dad threatened to sue my mom unless my name were changed. (Although my name in the book hadalreadybeen changed to Megan. By that point in my life, I had learned not to ask too many questions.)As another data point from the Megan’s Book of Divorcedebacle, I would like to submit this correction from a piece about me written in the New York Timesin 2022, which, for those keeping track at home, is 37 years after said sitcom. The correction was sent in by my father, who said: “An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that Molly Jong-Fast’s father, Jonathan Fast, sued her mother, Erica Jong, over Ms Jong’s depiction of a fictional character based on Ms Jong-Fast and her experience with her parents’ divorce. Mr Fast’s lawyer was involved in the dispute, but he did not file a lawsuit.”When the pilot was filmed in 1985, my mother took me out of school and moved us to LA for a month. We lived at the Beverly Hills hotel. I don’t remember much about living in LA except that it was yet another time when my mom was convinced that she had made it and wouldn’t have to worry about money any more. But the show was not picked up and we went home.What ended my parents’ union, I never could get a straight answer about. The reason I knew Mom was a liar was because her story always changed. Sometimes it was one thing, then sometimes it was an entirely different story. This shifting reality, this strange post-truth ecosystem she inhabited, and that for a time I inhabited, too, made me completely unable to know what was real and what was a lie with her. It was a kind of gaslighting by proxy, like Munchausen syndrome, but somehow much, much stupider. I grew up with a lot of mistrust about people. I was prickly. I was hard to connect with. I didn’t trust anyone. When I got sober at 19, I learned how to be an actual person. Before that I would do all sorts of alienating things and feel surprised when people felt alienated by me.Later my mother admitted they had an open marriage. My father, when questioned about this, said only, “Yes, shethoughtit was open.”“He was just too jealous of me,” she would tell me. My father was, at the time, working towards a master’s in social work. She said that kind of thing a lot, and about a lot of people. My father often said she was impossible to live with, an experience I’ve had first-hand. Should I blame the way she became on her fame, on all the years of people telling her she’d changed their lives? Or perhaps she was always like that.By the time I was born, Fear of Flyingwas already five years old. My unfamous father married a very famous woman, though they actually didn’t get married until my mom was pregnant with me because they both believed marriage was a bougie construct.My father’s famous father, communist hero Howard Fast, hadn’t been jailed or blacklisted since the 1940s, but he was still famous – or notorious – sort of. And Grandpa ended up back on the New York Times bestseller list much later, too, in the 80s, with a bunch of pulpy historical fiction novels. So my father had the double bad luck of being married to a famous writer and being the son of a famous writer.Even back then, I think that Mom was anxious about losing her fame. Mom clearly understood that fame was, even for most famous people, a temporary state. She was always convinced that someone might try and take her career away; the problem was, she was pretty sure it would be me.Mom was always convinced someone might try and take her career away; the problem was, she was pretty sure it would be meEventually, my dad moved out of our house. It was one of those epic divorces with teams of lawyers. And then mymomalso moved out of the house! She left me in Weston with my nanny, Margaret. Mom moved to New York and did the very 70s thing of sharing an apartment with another single gal. Let’s politely call the place where they lived their bachelorette pad. I stayed in the house in Weston for a year with Margaret, and eventually we were summoned back to New York. My mom had met a guy named Cash. He was in his 20s, and handsome. I assumed he was dumb, maybe he wasn’t. He was gone by the time I was old enough to make an assessment either way.Mom kept the place in Weston as her country house. I grew to loathe that house. Mostly it was the association of being left there alone with Margaret that year. It’s funny because when I was young my mom would tell me she was a great mom, then when I got a bit older, she would tell me that she practiced “benign neglect” – as if this parenting style was somehow by design.One day after she had tried this line on me too many times (obviously she felt terrible about the sort of mother she was), I just snapped and said, “It was justneglectneglect. Benign makes it sound intentional. Stopsayingthat.” She never said it again.I know how entitled I seem, complaining about my childhood. I mean, I never worked in a factory. I never wanted for one single material possession. Ever. Not once. I know how lucky I was, and am. I know how terrible the world is. But still. I want to tell the story not for any kind of pity, but for the hope that telling it will make me stop trying to relive it, will make my past go away. Even though I have spent my entire adulthood creating a different kind of life for myself, my head, my soul, my spirit – whatever you want to call it – is still stuck in the mire of my childhood.Mom was always travelling. There wasn’t an invitation to a book fair or festival, interview or speaking engagement that she’d decline. And when Momwasat home in New York, she was out dancing at Nell’s club, or fighting with Elaine, the owner of Elaine’s, the famous (infamous?) restaurant on the Upper East Side.Sometimes I’d be in bed and Mom would knock on my door, sometimes drunk and sometimes just tipsy, but always smelling of the most wonderful perfume. My bedroom was arguably the best room in the house – second floor, three huge windows, high, high ceilings. She’d peek her head in and stage-whisper, “I haveNew York Super Fudge Chunk!” Then she’d ask me if I wanted to go into her room and watch TV with her, on her bed.This was the best thing ever in the whole world. Margaret gave me a crazy strict bedtime, but when Mom would ask me to watch TV with her, I would run right up the stairs to her room and watch TV and eat ice-cream until my stomach hurt. I loved those nights so much.Mom would let me stay home from school the following day. She was a firm believer in mental health days. Margaret didn’t believe in mental health days, but my glamorous mom didn’t believe in the rules. Rules were for boring, unfamous people who balanced their cheque books. Rules were for normal people. My mother was not normal, nor did she want to be.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Photographs: courtesy of Molly Jong-FastTwo infamous/notorious sexologists, Phyllis and Eberhard Kronhausen, eventually moved into our ground floor, after their landlord, Shirley MacLaine, kicked them out of her apartment on Central Park West. It was nice to have someone else in the house, even if they were old and creepy and weirdly thin and leathery. They took handfuls of vitamins every day. Eventually, they moved back to their farm in Costa Rica. They told me I should come visit and I never did. They left the basement filled with erotic paintings as a gift to Mom.Most of the kids I knew growing up found the house, and our art, fascinating. My friend Ruthy couldn’t believe there was a painting of naked lesbians having sex at the top of the stairs. My other friend Juno wasn’t as shocked as Ruthy, but that was only because her parents were psychoanalysts and she had a male nanny.Much of my feminist mother’s time was occupied by men. But maybe, come to think of it, this shouldn’t come as all that much of a surprise to readers of her fiction. After all,in Fear of Flying, she wrote, “Underneath it all, you longed to be annihilated by love, to be swept off your feet, to be filled up by a giant prick spouting sperm, soapsuds, silks and satins, and of course, money.”And of course, money.She was always in love with someone. More often than not, it was a problematic man, a “no-account” count, a married writer who lived in Brooklyn, or a drug-addicted B-list actor. Between her divorce from my father (husband No 3) and her marriage tomy stepfather (husband No 4),there were numerous fiances. I couldn’t help but envision each one as a possible father. It would take me years to understand that the worst thing you could do to a kid was introduce her to possible stepfathers on a daily basis. But my feminist mother was always looking for someone to save her, someone to get her out of her own head.Where did those potential dads go? Did they end up finding other lives? Did they end up having other stepdaughters? Did they ever think about us? Even at the time I knew it was extremely strange to have all these adult men wander in and out of my life like actors auditioning for the part of playing the man who would eventually marry my mom.View image in fullscreen‘When you were little,’ Dad said, ‘I tried to get Mom to spend an hour a day with you. And she couldn’t do it.’Photograph: Caroll Taveras/The GuardianDid I mention those men ended up in the books? Because they did. Everyone ended up in her novels. Anyone who knew her knew that everything that happened went right into the books. Names were changed to make everything a little more pretentious, but some things were almost reported verbatim, and sometimes they were combined with weird hodgepodges of fantasies she had about other people. But the one thing that always happened was that she was the hero, always and for ever.I was 11 when Mom decided to marry Ken. They’d been going out for exactly 90 days. It was not my mother’s first engagement that year. But for whatever reason they decided to get married. The ceremony took place in the parking lot behind the humble ski condo Ken bought when he was living with the girlfriend who preceded Mom.Ken loved Mom.The rest of the world barely existed, mostly their reality was just their love for each other. I could tell I wasn’t really going to be a part of this new life. (Do I sound bitter?) I could sense that Ken wasn’t going to be much of a father to me. I recognised in him a kindred spirit, though not in a good way. He was loud. He was blustery. He was used to getting his own way. He thought he was always right. He ate Steak-umms for breakfast in his bathrobe.All these years later, I thank God for Ken. Had he not come along, I would have never survived my childhood, I would have been eclipsed by my mother’s need for me.Mom and Ken bought an apartment and right after we moved in, they fired Margaret. I was bereft. I wept. I had lost my best, and only, friend. I know how fucked up that is.Fast-forward to almost-present day. I spend my days feeling like a little girl wearing her mother’s enormous high heels through meetings with accountants and lawyers and doctors. I am talking to the movers and special fancy nursing home people who will charge lots of money for who knows what. Every day I visit Mom and Ken in the apartment I grew up in. They’re not children, not exactly, but they’re not adults any more either. They are like people, they look like people, but they aren’t making the kind of decisions that high- or even average-functioning people make.I will soon have to sell the apartment, at the bottom of the New York City real estate market. I have to manage things. I have finally made the decision to put my mother and stepfather in the World’s Most Expensive Nursing Home.I came to Mom and Ken’s apartment every day with a book about the nursing home, a luxe hardcover coffee-table book with beautiful pictures of the home’s five restaurants, its gym, its spa, its espresso lounge, its yoga studio, its saltwater pool. “You like to swim, right, Mom?” I’d ask. Every day, I’d sit in their dog pee-smelling apartment and show them the pages of the book. Mom was impressed by the restaurants. Sometimes they seemed open to the idea of moving, and sometimes not. And, just like Brigadoon, the thought would vanish and every night they’d forget the conversation. So every morning I’d have to remind them.View image in fullscreen‘I always wondered if she would have been better off with a dog.’Photograph: Caroll Taveras/The GuardianI’d say happy, positive things like, “It’s a hotel!” and, “It’s like it’s the Four Seasons!” And it trulyislike the Four Seasons. And probably even more expensive. It is beautifully designed – airy and light. I said things to make myself feel better, but it wasn’t clear that they knew what anything I was saying meant, and the reality of what I was doing did not change. I was putting them in a home. I was doing it because they both have dementia. I was doing it because I am a bad daughter who won’t devote her life to taking care of them, the way my sister-in-law did for my in-laws. I am a bad daughter. But, then again, they were terrible parents, so perhaps we’re tied.In my dark moments, I’m honest with myself. I know what I’m doing is wrong. I know they don’t want to go there. They are special. They have always thought of themselves as just a little too special to do the stuff normal people do. They have always considered themselves to be just a little too good for normal life.Today was move-in day. “We gave you power of attorney, and you put us in a home,” Mom said, as we arrived at the World’s Most Expensive Nursing Home. This was, on the face of it, true. Basically, the whole thing was reverse summer-camp drop-off. You lied to your parents just like you lied to your kids. But with the kids, you knew that they were going for a short period of time. With the parents, they were going for ever. With the kids, you knew you were doing something for their own good; with the parents, you were not so sure. Also, with the kids, you were pretty confident that they weren’t going to die there. With your parents, you knew they were.A couple of days later, I called my dad, my one remaining parent. I was in a taxi heading to CNN, to do a late-night panel. I told him Mom wasn’t dead yet but she wasn’t exactly there any more. I told him all she did was sleep and drink. I told him how guilty I felt. I said that I shouldn’t be at the CNN studios. Wherever I was, I felt I should have been somewhere else. I should have been spending more time with my kids, with my parents, with my dogs, with my husband who was very ill.Emma Brockes: Emma Brockes on how Erica Jong’s 1973 novel nearly blew the bowl haircut off her 13-year-old headRead moreMy dad tried to reassure me in his own peculiar, fucked-up way. “You know,” he said, “when you were a little girl, the nanny and I used to try and get your mom to spend time with you. We tried to get her to spend justan hour a daywith you.”This admission made me feelsogreat.“And she couldn’t do it,” my dad said. “She couldn’t even spendone hourwith you. The most she could do was half an hour.”Now, maybe my father was trying to use this knowledge as a way to make me feel less guilty about putting her in a home. Because when I go to visit her, she is always crying. She wasn’t a crier when I was a child, but she cries a lot now. Everyone who works there is worried about Mom. They are worried about the crying, but they are really,reallyworried about the drinking. And the more she drinks, the more she cries. (And the more she cries, the more she drinks.)I am the only bit of Erica Jong in the universe except for her, but she sits in a nursing home reading and rereading the newspaper.I had spent my entire life trying to get away from the loneliness of being abandoned by my parents. I assumed this would somehow preclude me from mourning their deaths. Like with almost everything in my life, I was deeply wrong. You can’t pre-grieve your parents, much as you might want to, or need to. As an addict, I was always looking for a quick fix, a way to skip the hard work. I was the second or third generation in the family to love diet pills. I would take them instead of eating. You can cheat your weight, but you can’t cheat grief. Even if your parents never loved you, or you never loved them, or some weird combination of the two, grief still comes for all of us.This is an edited extract from How to Lose Your Mother by Molly Jong-Fast, published by Picador on 26 June at £16.99.

But our mania for founder myths obscures an ideology of inequalityAlice BolinSun 8 Jun 2025 09.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 8 Jun 2025 19.47 EDTShareView image in fullscreenOne Saturday in the spring of 2021, a little achy after receiving our first doses of the Covid-19 vaccine, my husband and I decided to stay in bed and click on the first thing suggested to us by our TV. It wasWeWork: Or the Making and Breaking of a $47 Billion Unicorn, a documentary produced by Hulu about the New York startup WeWork’s spectacular fall from grace. The film mostly chronicles the misdeeds of founder Adam Neumann, the surfer-dude dolt who turned a good idea – co-working spaces that lease small offices to tech startups – into a surreally overvalued conglomerate, before he made a mortifying attempt to take the company public that eventually ended in his forced resignation. As a consolation prize, Neumann infamously received a $1.7bn golden parachute.The WeWork cautionary tale is partly about slick marketing, which is what seems to have convinced its investors that it was a tech startup. Neumann tried to position WeWork as something much more than a real estate company: he borrowed the tech industry’s idealistic language about changing the world but upped the ante, insisting that the company’s sole mission was “elevat[ing] the world’s consciousness”.This is a smart idea when trying to keep billionaire investors’ money spigots flowing. A real estate flipper has a finite worth, based on markets, profits and expenses, but a company that “elevates the world’s consciousness”, well, who knows where they might go with it? There is evidence, though, that WeWork executives were starting to buy into their own marketing – to get high, so to speak, on their own supply. As Gabriel Shermanwrites in Vanity Fair, Neumann was known to make insane pronouncements about “wanting to be elected president of the world, live forever, and become humanity’s first trillionaire”. When SoftBank CEO and future WeWork investor Masayoshi Son met Neumann, he asked him: “In a fight, who wins – the smart guy or the crazy guy?” “Crazy guy,” Neumann answered.WeWork pushed its romantic origin story, which involved Neumann and co-founder Miguel McKelvey’s idyllic childhoods thousands of miles apart: Neumann on a kibbutz in Israel, McKelvey on a hippie commune in Oregon. From this formative experience of communal living, so the story went, they created WeWork – what Neumann described with the impossible concept of the “capitalist kibbutz”.View image in fullscreenMovie still featuring Adam Neumann from WeWork: Or the Making and Breaking of a $47 Billion Unicorn (2021).Photograph: Everett Collection Inc/AlamyThese canned origin stories are what passes for good storytelling in an age when we are eager to swallow anything tech jams down our throats. And tech is only the most recent phenomenon that has made us simps for narratives about powerful men and how they got that way. This is a tendency that seems rooted particularly in American DNA, one that has been exploited for centuries to rope people into wars, cults and scams – with our unjust societal status quo being the greatest scam of all. Our obsession with brute power has gotten us where we are now, a system where nearly 100% of American wealth is concentrated in the hands of a few men, one of whom has ascended to the highest political office (twice!) to become our very own authoritarian strongman.View image in fullscreenSympathy for the assholeNeumann fashioned himself after the spiritual tech-guy archetype, like the shadow side of Jack Dorsey from Twitter, whose Buddhist renunciation act contrasted dissonantly with the famously toxic website he founded. But Neumann has his own shadow in Billy McFarland, the con artist laughingstock who took entrepreneurial speculative fiction to Icarian heights with his Fyre festival. The 26-year-old McFarland and the rapper Ja Rule went all in on a pipe dream to hold a luxury music festival on what was once Pablo Escobar’s private island in the Bahamas. Marketing the festival on social media was their sole concern – they reportedly paid Kendall Jenner $250,000 for an Instagram post – when it could have been food, bathrooms and housing for their 5,000 ticket holders.When their guests arrived, instead of luxury villas on a deserted private island, they found hurricane tents and inflatable mattresses on a residential construction site. The privileged would-be concertgoers spent a terrifying night of Lord of the Flies-style chaos in the tents before the festival was canceled, prompting schadenfreude the likes of which Twitter had rarely seen.I’m not saying that McFarland, who was released in 2022 after serving four years in prison for fraud, is the same as any other tech entrepreneur, but it’s easy to see how the tech market draws con artists like roaches to grease. For one thing, McFarland was punished not for defrauding his customers – whom he put in serious danger, in addition to stealing their money – but his billionaire investors. Once again, the flows and reversals of capital float above real life, with all our ant-like obsession with cause and effect and human suffering.The Social Network [was] created by a team of men who have internalized the myth of their own temperamental geniusOne of Silicon Valley’s most dearly held and deleterious myths is of its boy geniuses. McFarland reportedly idolized Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg, and I would be willing to bet that he styled himself not only on the real Zuckerberg but on Zuckerberg as he was fictionalized by the screenwriter Aaron Sorkin in 2010’s The Social Network, one of the most influential documents in shaping the narrative of Web 2.0. My husband and I also watched The Social Network while laid up from the vaccine. I had never seen it before, and more than 10 years after it was made amid a tech backlash with its target squarely on Zuckerberg and Facebook, I found the movie’s tone strange, as it portrayed Zuckerberg as a manipulative misogynist who is nevertheless one of the visionary geniuses of our times. As Zadie Smith pointed out in her 2010 essay on the film,Generation Why?, this does not really conform with what we know of Zuckerberg, who is so bland that his only explanation for why he invented Facebook, beyond a mystical fixation on the word “connection”, is that he liked “building things”.The unwitting assault on democracy, community and the human sense of self by a bunch of college sophomores who liked building things is not a bad story, but it’s clear why it is not the one that Sorkin chose. AsMark Harris wrote in New Yorkmagazine in 2010, the film’s central narrative question could be stated as: “What exactly does it mean to be an asshole?” Women in the film’s first and last beats tell Zuckerberg that he either is or isn’t an asshole, and in the intervening two hours, he confidently fucks people over like an oblivious poster in the Am I the Asshole? subreddit.But this does not make him a villain; it is more of his tragic flaw. One must imagine that Elon Musk has done some of this same rationalizing as he has gone from being hailed as the real-life Iron Man to his new role as Twitter’s head troll and eviscerator of the American federal government at Doge. Moving fast and breaking things means some people will think you’re an asshole. Or maybe you have to be an asshole to be effective – assholes are the real good guys! Harris innocently reports in New York that Sorkin and the film’s director, David Fincher, relate to Zuckerberg, having “been at some point in their professional lives on the receiving end of the word asshole”. The Social Network’s alternate title could be Sympathy for the Asshole, having been created by a team of men who have internalized the myth of their own temperamental genius and are intoxicated by stories of others who have done the same.This is a favorite theme of Sorkin, who has become the go-to screenwriter for contemporary “Great Man” stories. His Steve Jobs, from the biopicSteve Jobs, is a total dick, questioning his daughter’s paternity in the national press and screwing over his collaborators and mentors. And still his genius is assured, if ineffable: in one scene, Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak blows up at Jobs, telling him: “How come 10 times in a day, I read Steve Jobs is a genius? What do you do?” Jobs’s response is that his inability to write code is irrelevant since he is like a conductor, “play[ing] the orchestra”, coordinating technicians under his sweeping business vision.View image in fullscreenPosters from The Social Network (2010) and Steve Jobs (2015).Composite: Sony Pictures, Universal StudiosTech founders’ self-belief is broadcast by the geniuses they name their businesses after: Tesla is a conspicuous example, and Apple is, of course, a nod to Isaac Newton.Steve Jobsand The Social Network are full of mini-monologues about the future of computing and the lives of historical Great Men like Alan Turing, creating little biopics within biopics.Intelligence is signified in Sorkin’s work by simply knowing a lot of facts, and his nerd heroes are often being asked difficult trivia questions so that they can answer them correctly, like the sixth-grade brownnosers they once were. As Joan Didion said of Woody Allen’s characters in 1979: “They reflect exactly the false and desperate knowingness of the smartest kid in the class,” but at least Allen’s characters are just dilettante writers with teenage girlfriends, not the supposed incarnations of the spirit of American innovation. This juvenile intelligence and ruthlessness seem to go hand in hand. One of the leitmotifs of Sorkin’s tech biopics is, as I am sure he read on brainyquote.com: “Great artists steal.” Zuckerberg and Jobs in his movies are defiant about their practice of plundering other people’s hard work. This Sorkin does not exactly share with them, since his biopics are ahistorical fantasies, telling stories that are mostly Sorkin’s own invention.“I’m really weak when it comes to plot,” Sorkin told New York. “With nothing to stop me, I’ll write pages and pages of snappy dialogue that don’t add up to anything.” By seizing on poetic license, he can push those popular narratives even further, plating up the Zuckerberg and Jobs of our dreams, our very own assholes to rival the assholes of history such as Henry Ford, Thomas Edison and Walt Disney. Sorkin’s appeal is not to artistic ingenuity but national pride, creating corporate propaganda so satisfying that his lines from The Social Network have become tech truisms – “we lived on farms, then we lived in cities, now we’re going to live on the internet” – reshaping reality around itself.We should no longer blindly celebrate people for so low and ambiguous a bar as ‘changing the world’I can admit that this version of the Facebook story is easier to face than the truth. As Smith writes in Generation Why?, Facebook was a haphazard invention, with little thought given to its look or function, reducing all of us in the end to the 19-year-old who invented it. There is a strange resonance with Smith’s unanswerable questions – “Why? Why Facebook? … Why do it like that?” she asks. The granddaddy of all tech scams, Enron, the energy provider turned online trading marketplace whose unironic motto was: “Ask why.” In addition to wreaking havoc on Texas and California energy sectors (damage that, in our climate change–addled present, we are still suffering from), Enron’s executives were maestros of fake accounting, hiding billions of dollars in debt to keep the firm’s stock price high before its epic collapse in 2001. The definitive book on the Enron scandal, adapted into a documentary with the same name, is calledEnron: The Smartest Guys in the Room, and its executives loved to congratulate themselves for their intelligence, casting it as the means to justify any sordid ends.In a Sorkinist reading of history, American progress is safe-guarded because the assholes we endow with great power are inoculated with visionary genius. But intelligence, popularly taken to mean devious cleverness or maybe just privilege, has never been synonymous with moral goodness, and we should no longer blindly celebrate people for so low and ambiguous a bar as “changing the world”. Why? Why Facebook? Why Enron? Why is our economy an unregulated wasteland of self-dealing, where theft is not an aberration but the very foundation of the world’s greatest fortunes? Musk has become the archetypal tech founder not only for his passion for self-beatification – he revived the dream of space travel! And he makeselectriccars! – but now also for his Dr Evil-style eccentricity and megalomania, essentiallybuying controlof the federal government, which he spent four months haphazardly decimating.Tech is only the latest sector to take cover in the American mania for founder myths, with the virtual requirement that they be mostly made up. (Elizabeth Holmes, the sociopathic founder of the fraudulent medical startup Theranos and one of Silicon Valley’s few girl geniuses, courted investors with a falsified sob story about her uncle dying of skin cancer.) This narrative impulse comes from our own epic origin story, our misplaced pride in the genius of the founding fathers that has become one of the main stagnating forces of American government.Our stubborn American social structure, where wealth and political power are so ludicrously concentrated, was seemingly incarnated in the founders, some of the smartest guys of the 18th century, whose inspiring opening salvo, a poetic ode to all men being created equal, was maybe more marketing than actual game plan. With this, they got the foreign policy apparatus of France to buy into what might be the most ambitious and visionary startup venture of all time: the United States of America. The figures of the founders are narcotizing antidotes to the reformer spirit; depictions of them as revolutionaries foreclose any further revolution as redundant. It is no wonder they are foisted on us by the entire spectrum of cultural gatekeepers, including politicians, publishing, Disney, the Tonys, the Grammys and the Pulitzer prize.Why else would we be so taken in by the romanticized story of our most corrupt and problematic founding father? Yes, you know the one.View image in fullscreenWho tells your story?Lin-Manuel Miranda got the idea for his musical Hamilton when he bought a copy of Ron Chernow’s biography of the founding father at the airport. “When I encountered Alexander Hamilton I was immediately captivated,” Miranda said. “He’s an inspirational figure to me. And an aspirational one.” Miranda has popularized the fantasy that Hamilton’s was a New York immigrant story, like those of Miranda’s parents, who moved to New York from Puerto Rico. But Hamilton was not an immigrant as we now think of them: he did move to New York from the Caribbean, but as an English citizen moving between two of England’s colonies. (Despite having American citizenship, Puerto Ricans living in the United States are seen as more “foreign” than Hamilton would have been.) And disregarding rumors kicked up by the musical’s popularity, he was white.Miranda’s casting of the founding fathers with Black and Hispanic actors was a stroke of genius, since it clouded Hamilton’s politics in a confusion so profound that few people felt like questioning them. One might even forget to notice that the musical portrays no actual people of color. As the historianLyra D Monteirowrote in The Public Historian, Hamilton repackages the same myths of the founders that we have received from time immemorial, particularly the myth that white men were the only people of any importance living in America during this time.View image in fullscreenLin-Manuel Miranda (center) and the cast of Hamilton perform at the 58th Grammy awards on 15 February 2016 in New York City.Photograph: Theo Wargo/WireImage/Getty ImagesDespite his overtures to the subjectivity of history, with the final song inHamiltonrepeating the question: “Who lives, who dies, who tells your story?” Miranda misses the irony – that he has perpetuated a narrative by white men about white men, because the founder biography is an essentially white genre, especially the ones you can buy at the airport.Maybe I’m crazy, but as I sat down to watch the live version made available on Disney+, I assumed that a hip-hop musical about the founding fathers would be at least somewhat tongue-in-cheek, poking holes in our pieties about the founders. Instead, I watched a very long and self-serious biography of Hamilton, with a sentimentality about its subject worthy of the Walt Disney Company. This combination – a performance of diversity crossed with the familiar sanding down of the sharper edges of American history – makes Hamilton “one of the most brilliant propaganda pieces in theatrical history”, as Matt Stoller writes, and one, if Disney has anything to say about it, that will be shown to schoolchildren annually for the rest of forever.The shifting popular image of Hamilton is itself a gauge of the relative strength of democratic institutions at any given momentMatt StollerStoller’s essayThe Hamilton Hustle from the Baffleris an exhaustive and illuminating rundown of all of Alexander Hamilton’s faults and misdeeds. Hamilton not only was in favor of centralized government but was vehemently anti-democracy, calling the American people “a great beast”. Instead, he envisioned a United States run by an elite coalition of wealthy financiers and military officers, and much of his career was dedicated to fucking over the small farmers who formed the majority of the American population. And while Chernow presents Hamilton as an abolitionist, he married into a family of slaveholders and sold enslaved people himself.Hamilton’s authoritarianism had long-lasting effects, eviscerating the economic power of the middle classes and creating stratification and inequality that we still recognize today. It is baffling that educated, progressive people so willingly accepted Miranda’s fairytale about the father of modern finance so soon after the 2008 financial crisis, in which the craven stupidity of Wall Street bankers nearly caused global economic collapse. But this may be exactly why Hamilton was such a phenomenon. As Stoller writes, Hamilton is so resilient a figure in the American popular consciousness that “the shifting popular image of Hamilton is itself a gauge of the relative strength of democratic institutions at any given moment”– that is, the more popular Hamilton is, the less healthy American democracy is.Hamilton the musical exemplifies a familiar leftist critique of contemporary liberalism: that the appearance of progress, particularly involving narratives about “strong women” and “breaking down historic barriers”, stands in for the real thing. With this frame, Hamilton is the quintessential Obama-era document, with Obama’s secretary of the treasury, Timothy Geithner, calling Hamilton the “original Mr Bailout”. Geithner’s blanket bailout of the big banks, with the architects of the financial crisis going totally unpunished, was a travesty we are only beginning to reckon with, but one thing it did for certain is pass the baton of bank-friendly economic policies between the Bush and Obama administrations, with Obama’s innovation being an even closer relationship with tech founders, the titans of our new Gilded Age.Barack and Michelle Obama have said of their greatest strength: “One way of looking at what we’ve both been doing for the last 20 years, maybe most of our careers, was to tell stories.” This is true, and they are maybe a little too good at it. Maybe this is why I am a bit grumpy about the Obamas’ choice to start a film and TV production company with their post-White House popularity, moving decisively into the realm where they have always most excelled: celebrity. Their company is called Higher Ground Productions, which they claim is an ode to Stevie Wonder, but this phrase inevitably evokes Michelle Obama’s catchphrase on the 2016 campaign trail: “When they go low, we go high.” This policy of tight-lipped civility was no match for the emergency of the Trump moment – it’s embarrassing when one thinks of how low we have sunk from there – but it was a savvy act of image preservation, one that ensured that the Obamas would weather the Trump era unscathed, no matter if the rest of us will.Just as it is for Silicon Valley founders, for the Obamas, “good storytelling” is synonymous with good branding. And, of course, big streaming companies such as Netflix, whom the Obamas’ production company signed an eight-figure deal with in 2018, do not see their “content” as separate from the demands of marketing. To them, good stories are the ones people want to hear because they’ve heard them before, thus the knockoffs they produce of all their most popular shows: iterating, iterating, iterating. Who lives, who dies, who tells your story?View image in fullscreenWho wins?Since I wrote the first draft of this piece in 2021, there have been so many tech scandals and meltdowns that I have been able to shoehorn in only a few of them here, and it is interesting how we seem to have as healthy an appetite for stories of tech villains as those of tech founders. Sam Bankman-Fried makes a great story whether he’s the barefoot CEO giving all his money away or the incompetent crook gambling with his investors’ savings. We love Musk whether he’s exploring space or destroying Twitter (now X) and the American administrative state. It’s the ultimate postmodern nightmare, where truth and taste are not only contested but irrelevant.One simple reason that documentaries have abounded in the past 10 years – particularly notable was the release of two competing Fyre festival documentaries at the exact same time – is because of the amount of video footage that now exists of basically everyone since the rise of reality television and the iPhone. Social media feeds exemplify the total victory of spectacle over argument, a stream of unlimited, barely distinguishable content, narrativeless and authored by everyone. We look at the dominance of social media apps and start seeking the Great Men behind them, completely ignoring the billions of users who have donated their time, confessions and creativity to make them compelling.The fickle winds of marketing may finally be blowing against these self-styled Great MenOne sees this startlingly with HBO’s documentary series Q: Into the Storm, which seeks out the men behind the mega-conspiracy theory QAnon. The documentary film-maker Cullen Hoback had remarkable access to Jim and Ron Watkins, the father-son duo in the Philippines who ran the anonymous message board 8chan, where Q, a supposed “deep-state” operative, posted warnings of a cabal of powerful pedophiles who can only be stopped by a heroic PresidentDonald Trump. Hoback comes to the same conclusion that many other journalists already have, that Ron Watkins had been writing Q’s posts since 2017, and that both Jim and Ron had heavy interests in promoting QAnon.But Q was never one person: Ron Watkins did not originate the persona, and the anonymous message board that was QAnon’s birthplace was crucial for its development, as a kind of collaborative fiction written by a web of different authors.QAnonis a case study in the power of emergence, though it is all in service to perhaps the least deserving and most powerful Great Man on the planet: Trump. In terms of sheer people power, it acts like a microcosm of social media or even the United States itself, this concentration of human ingenuity misdirected to benefit people who are already rich and powerful. This is another way of saying, as my Marxist brother tells me, that workers create value, even as regular people have so little power in this time of inequality, price increases, stagnant wages, environmental injustice and war.View image in fullscreenVideo images of Donald Trump before his speech to supporters, at the Ellipse at the White House in Washington, on 6 January 2021 as Congress prepares to certify electoral college votes.Photograph: Bill Clark/CQ-Roll Call, Inc/Getty ImagesThe current billionaire class has more power than any human beings have ever had, and they wield it with remarkably little responsibility. Billionaires must be cut down to size through every means possible, from breaking up monopolies to tax reform to financial regulation to union drives. But we also need to stop swallowing these Great Man stories whole and recognize them for what they are: an ideology of dominance. I do not exaggerate when I say that this ideology is not only impoverishing the narratives available to us but endangering human lives and the future of civilization.But the wheel is beginning to turn. Tech billionaires’ public image is in the toilet, with these former “visionaries” seeming ever more embarrassing, monomaniacal, shortsighted and pathetic. This is true of Trump, too, whose bizarre and ever-changing tariff policies led to awful approval ratings almost as soon as his second term started. Of course, we could have said this in the fall of 2024, too, when he was making rambling speeches about Hannibal Lecter and interrupting campaign events to sway sleepily to Ave Maria – none of which was enough to cost him the election.The fickle winds of marketing may finally be blowing against these self-styled Great Men, but they know more keenly than anyone that all publicity is good publicity: McFarland was recently back in the news, capitalizing on the attention garnered by his notorious failures, claiming he wanted to host a Fyre festival 2. It will take more than our disapproval to stop them all from failing up like Neumann, who was so incompetent that he got paid more than a billion dollars to quit his job.Who wins, the smart guy or the crazy guy? The crazy guy, and he’s getting crazier every day.Alice Bolin is the author of Dead Girls: Essays on Surviving an American Obsession and Culture Creep: Notes on the Pop Apocalypse, out this month.

Photograph: Cybele Malinowski/The GuardianSeventeen years ago Nathan Dunne was locked out of his body, or at least that’s how it felt. He talks about his battle with depersonalisation disorder – and his sudden fear of waterByPaula CocozzaSun 8 Jun 2025 06.30 EDTLast modified on Sun 8 Jun 2025 22.13 EDTShareOn a cold winter’s night, in a “fit of spontaneity”, Nathan Dunne and his girlfriend went for a midnight swim on Hampstead Heath in London. They had been living together for a few months and, although it was dark and chilly, they “had a summer feeling in that first flush of the relationship”, Dunne says. They shed their clothes and waded into the shallows. After diving into the icy water, Dunne’s girlfriend put her lips to his cheek, and as they pulled apart, his life changed beyond all recognition. “It was like being struck. Like something came down,” he says, slicing the air with his hand. “The flip of a switch.”Dunne’s transformation sounds like a fairytale in reverse: one kiss, and his life turned into a nightmare. Seventeen years have passed since that night, and he still mostly explains the change in himself in metaphors and similes. His eyes filled with soot. His voice was a robot’s. He felt as if he were locked outside his body, which became a sort of “second body”. Any form of water, from a raindrop to a warm bath, made everything worse. His terror and panic were so great that the next day he smashed a vase and used a shard to cut himself. An “attempt to not live any more”, is how he describes it.It would take Dunne three-and-a-half years to learn that what he had experienced was the onset of depersonalisation disorder, adissociative disorderbelieved to affect about 1.3 million people in the UK, a similar number to those with bipolar disorder, though the condition is far less known. When Dunne became ill, in 2008, the wait for a diagnosis on the NHS was thought to be between eight and 12 years. Awareness has since increased; in 2017 the MP Lyn Brownbrought a constituent’s experience of depersonalisation to the attention of parliament. A charity,Unreal, was launched two years later. Now Dunne, 45, has written a book, When Nothing Feels Real: A Journey Into the Mystery Illness of Depersonalisation.View image in fullscreen‘It was like being struck. The flip of a switch’ … Dunne aged 24, in 2004.Photograph: Courtesy of Nathan DunneIt is an eye-watering and disorienting account of a condition that Dunne evokes so vividly, it doesn’t always appear to be behind him. “Truth be told, I still have ‘second body symptoms’,” he says. “I don’t know if they will ever leave.”Indeed, the book’s awful twist is that although researching the history of the illness felt intensely validating, and writing brought a sense of coherence to fragments of memory, it also triggered a relapse. In 2022, Dunne had a nervous breakdown. “I was not able to function in any reasonable way,” he says. “It was about as bad as it can get.” It’s fair to say that healing is very much a continuing process.We are speaking on a video call. Dunne, who was in London studying for a PhD in art history when he fell ill, now lives in Sydney with his wife, a professor of philosophy. Last month they became parents to a baby girl. Dunne works as a freelance writer, specialising in film and art, and is sufficiently recovered that he sometimes goes for a swim. “I hope to take my daughter to the beach. Something really super-normal. That thought fills me with joy and hope for the future,” he says.One of the greatest challenges has been the mysteriousness and unrelatability of his illness. While he knew something terrible had happened to him, he couldn’t say what. The “second body symptoms” felt impossible to convey without resorting to hyperbole and abstraction, which seemed to discredit his illness even as he described it.Each morning, he watched himself get up, dress, make his breakfast, all from above himself – this should be taken literally, he says – looking down on the top of his own head, his foreshortened body, from within the confines of a vessel that to him resembled a waterlogged black box. He knew something of bipolar disorder, having been very troubled by a visit to a family member in a psychiatric ward. But he knew he didn’t have it, because unlike them, he says: “I had an acute sense of what was happening to me.” He kept looking at his hands for reassurance, but saw only “the hands of a ghost”.He Googled: “Why do I feel outside my body?” “What is happening to me when I see myself from above?” “Am I going mad?” Doctor after doctor raised their eyebrows. His girlfriend despaired of him, and soon moved out.In the weeks and months that followed, Dunne underwent many diagnostic tests including an MRI, a chest X-ray and checks on his eyesight, blood and stool samples. All came back normal. Depersonalisation is commonly misdiagnosed as depression and before long Dunne was prescribed antidepressants. Although he sensed the error, he didn’t argue. “I felt as if I needed medicine. I could take a pill and think: ‘Maybe tomorrow will be different.’”View image in fullscreen‘I had an acute sense of what was happening’ … giving a lecture in Russia, 2015.Photograph: Courtesy of Nathan DunneOn less symptomatic days, he continued to study, but his quest to heal himself became more desperate. He went to stay with a friend in Los Angeles and drove into the Mojave desert, looking for “a more expansive space, to try to open up this narrow view”. But he saw it all from the damp black box above his head. Some things helped briefly: listening to Dylan Thomas’ Under Milk Wood on repeat; drawing pictures of himself in the womb; making a mosaic of a Rubens painting; picking at the skin of his palms, to know where his edges were, something he found “very grounding, very physical”.Back in London, feeling outside himself and the world, and increasingly obsessive about his ex-girlfriend, he made business cards that said “Call me”, with his phone number on. A sex worker, whose card he took down from a phone box to make space for his own, was one angry respondent. Another was a man who felt suicidal; he and Dunne spoke for hours, and afterwards, Dunne changed his phone number. In the book, he appears to do this without qualms. Alongside his self-estrangement was an intense self-absorption that often creates an empathy gap between Dunne and the reader. When, for instance, his mother told him on his birthday how wonderful it had been to carry him, he replied: “That’s not how it was for me … I was trapped.”What is his understanding now of why he became ill? “I thought I was far more robust than I was,” he says. “I don’t think I’ve ever found life very easy.” He was born in Brisbane, Australia, and grew up in Bengaluru, India, where his parents were Protestant missionaries. “That makes for a particular kind of intensity in the family,” he says. Rather than look for a single cause of his depersonalisation, he has found it more fruitful to think of it as a buildup of traumas – “neurological, biological, and just life experience”.To take off your clothes and get into a bath with an older woman you’ve just met is not a very normal thing to doEach day he wondered who he was, and whether he would ever go back to being the whole person he had been. The first big turning point came when he locked eyes with a woman at a Rodin lecture. She was in her 60s. “We didn’t fall in love in a romantic way, but it was an understanding of one another at first sight,” Dunne says. “Something about our experiences of life [made us] instantly trust each other.”They went back to her house, and in one of the book’s most moving sequences, she asked him: “What’s your greatest fear?” “Having a bath,” Dunne replied. At this, she rose and turned on the hot tap in the bathroom, then sat in the room while he undressed and climbed in the tub. “To take off your clothes and get into a bath with an older woman you’ve just met is not a very normal thing to do,” Dunne says. “But something in her personality fostered an atmosphere where that was possible.” And something in Dunne’s illness, his foreshortened view of the world, created an openness to oddity.A friendship grew that “helped to rebuild my capacity to love”, Dunne says. She told him: “You think of this thing you have as for ever. But I’ve lived long enough to know that there are just bad seasons in life. And then, one day … The world is new again.”Depersonalisation disorder: the condition you’ve never heard of that affects millionsRead moreIn 2011, with no money, job, or strength to study, Dunne complied with his mother’s suggestion to return home to Sydney. He moved into his parents’ garage, and she pointed out a number for a specialist she had stuck on the fridge. After a few weeks, he got a referral, and it was in this doctor’s office that Dunne was diagnosed with depersonalisation. “It was amazing when he said the word. Relief – and scepticism: ‘I can’t really hope this much, can I?’”Dunne left the consultation with three objects: a bottle of water, a towel and a hessian bag to keep them in – an exposure and response prevention (ERP) kit. Each morning he was to dip his fingers in the water, and each afternoon wrap the wet towel around his hand. The idea being that a person who carries a small piece of their greatest fear will dilute that fear over time. “You are allowed to cry, but not to whine,” the doctor told him. “It can make you treatment-resistant.”Dunne combined his ERP with repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation at a private clinic – something else his mother came across – in which a magnetic coil is placed on a patient’s head so that magnetic pulses can target parts of the brain impaired by illness; in Dunne’s case, the parietal lobe, which helps to maintain a unified sense of the body. Six months later, he emerged from his parents’ garage for breakfast one morning, and told his mum: “I’m becoming myself again.”Dunne completed his PhD, and is no longer on the specialist’s books. He continues to take medication and attend therapy. Most importantly, he knows which tools to use when symptoms recur. “When you’re looking down on yourself, I’ve been taught to speak to it. You live with it, you write with it. You help to diminish its hold over you. You accept this distorted perception, this minor confinement,” he says.View image in fullscreen‘I still have “second body symptoms”’ ... Dunne in Australia, May 2025.Photograph: Cybele Malinowski/The GuardianThough, in truth, more than acceptance, it is the idea of “surrender” that he has found most helpful. “Ideas of radical acceptance – I’ve tried all of those things, I can’t relate to that language. Perhaps ‘surrender’ works because it’s the last thing I want to do,” he says. “To surrender means this thing will have its way with you. When I’m in the thick of difficult symptoms, I imagine myself being steamrolled over, and being OK with that. The other word that really helped me over the years is ‘float’. The last thing I want to do is float with the second body symptoms. But the word itself, the sensation – it allows you to surrender to it, by joining it.”He holds up his palms, flaky after all these years with picked skin. Sometimes, the wounds get so bad he has to go to the doctor. But he finds it “very pleasant to go for something ordinary”.The emotional legacy is perhaps harder to confront. When Dunne started dating again, he worried he had “limited love” to give. He and his wife have been together for 11 years now. “I do think I am more limited than I was, and I wish that wasn’t the case,” he says. “My daughter is a week old. I wonder about how much I can give, and I hope I can give everything.“Maybe lots of people doubt whether they can give enough to the people they love. However, I feel the illness has limited me. Like, I won’t be able to recognise when I need to give more. I have to have faith in others who have been able to do it.”He and his wife have developed a phrase to support themselves through the hardest times. “There’s alwaysthe core us,” they tell each other. “It is,” Dunne says, “both a memory of our love and an acknowledgment of our efforts to sustain it.”When Nothing Feels Real: A Journey Into the Mystery Illness of Depersonalisation by Nathan Dunne is published byMurdoch Books(£16.99, A$34.99).In the UK and Ireland,Samaritanscan be contacted on freephone 116 123, or emailjo@samaritans.orgorjo@samaritans.ie.

It’s a sentiment eagerly embraced by The Dull Men’s Club. Several million members in a number of connected Facebook groups strive to cause dullness in others on a daily basis. In this club, they wear their dullness with pride. The duller the better. This is where the nerds of the world unite.“Posts that contain bitmoji-avatar-things are far too exciting, and will probably get deleted,” warn the rules of the Dull Men’s Club (Australian branch).Maintaining standards of dullness is paramount. Alan Goodwin in the UK recently worried that seeing a lesser spotted woodpecker in his garden might be “a bit too exciting” for the group. In the same week, a flight tracker struggled to keep his excitement to an acceptable level when military jets suddenly appeared on his screen.View image in fullscreenAndrew McKean moved to a care facility after a heart attack.Photograph: Bec Lorrimer/The GuardianThis is the place for quirky hobbies, obscure interests, the examination of small, ordinary things.

Above all, it is whimsical, deeply ironic, self-effacing and sarcastic humour.There is an art to being both dull and droll. “It’s tongue-in-cheek humour,” says founder Grover Click (a pseudonym chosen for its dullness). “A safe place to comment on daily things.” Exclamation marks, he says, “are far too exciting.” (On his site, ridicule is against the rules, as is politics, religion, and swearing.)There is, says Bt Humble, a moderator for the Australian branch, “a level of one-upmanship. It’s sort of competitive dullness.” Dull people trying to out-dull each other.View image in fullscreenIn his writing, McKean has elevated the dull institutional days into something poetic and poignant.Photograph: Bec Lorrimer/The GuardianAre there people who are just too exciting for the club? “There isn’t actually a mandatory level of dullness,” he admits, although some of the members he has met “would bore the ears off you”.It all started in New York in the early 1980s. Click, now 85, and his friends were sitting at the long bar of the New York Athletic club reading magazine articles about boxing, fencing, judo and wrestling. “One of my mates said, ‘Dude, we don’t do any of those things.’” They had to face it. They were dull. They decided to embrace their dullness.As a joke, they started The Dull Men’s Club, which involved some very silly, dull activities. They chartered a tour bus but didn’t go anywhere. “We toured the bus. We walked around the outside of the bus a few times. And the driver explained the tyre pressures and turned on the windscreen wipers.”In 1996, when Click moved to the UK, his nephew offered to build a website for “that silly Dull Men’s Club”.Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morningToday, Click’s copyrighted Dull Men’s Club Facebook group has 1.9 million members. There is an annual calendar featuring people with peculiar hobbies, a book – Dull Men of Great Britain – merchandise and not one but two awards: Anorak of the Year in the UK and DMC Person of the Year for the rest of the world. There are also numerous copycat Dull Men’s Clubs, including one that has 1.7 million members. Click is “very surprised” that so many people identify as dull. The Australian club has 8,000 members. Comparatively small but definitely holding its own in the dullness department.View image in fullscreenAndrew self-publishes books and regularly posts his writing on Facebook group, including the Dull Men’s Club.Photograph: Bec Lorrimer/The GuardianMuch of the minutiae of life gets on members’ nerves, as does poor workmanship. Five hundred amused comments followed a post about coat hangers inserted into hoops on rails in hotel rooms. “That would keep me up all night,” said one person.The over or under toilet paper debate raged (politely) for two and a half weeks. Then there was the dismantling of electronic appliances. Or photographing post boxes, the ranking of every animated movie from one to 100 – 100 being “dull and pointless”. Members judge the speed of other people’s windscreen wipers against their own, or in the case of Australia’s Simon Molina, stuff as many used toilet rolls as possible inside another. “It’s extremely dull.” There was the late John Richards who founded the Apostrophe Protection Society and 94-year-old Lee Maxwell who has fully restored 1,400 antique washing machines – that no one will ever use.Australian member Andrew McKean, 85, had dullness thrust upon him. He is, dare I say it, an interesting anomaly in the Dull Men’s Club, a shift in tone. Three years ago, he had a heart attack. He recovered but the hospital’s social workers deemed him unable to care for his wife, Patricia, and they moved to a nursing home in New South Wales. There is nothing droll or amusing about being stuck in a nursing home. But he has elevated the dull institutional days into something poetic and poignant by writing about them and posting “to you strangers” in The Dull Men’s Club.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFive Great ReadsFree weekly newsletterEach week our editors select five of the most interesting, entertaining and thoughtful reads published by Guardian Australia and our international colleagues.

An electronics engineer, in 1967 he was connected to the Apollo moon mission. Then a career in the television broadcasting industry took him to the UK, Malta, West Africa and Canada.Once a traveller who lived in a sprawling house at Pittwater who spent his days in the sea, now his life is reduced to a single room – “Every trace of my existence is contained within these walls.” Sitting in his worn, frayed armchair by the window “watching the light shift across the garden, he writes about ageing and “the slow unfolding of a life”.He is surrounded by the “faint hum of machines and the shuffle of slippers … the squeak of a wheelchair, the smell of disinfectant”.With the club, McKean has found his people, his tribe, within this self-deprecating community. At 85, he has foundfans.Even if they are proudly dull.He lives for the bus and a few hours of freedom in a life that has shrunk. On the bus “something stirs in us, a flicker of youth perhaps”. He treats himself to KFC, “the sharp tang of it a small rebellion against the home’s bland meals”.View image in fullscreenMcKean finds connection to others through his writing.Photograph: Bec Lorrimer/The GuardianHe sits on a park bench, an old man with a stick, invisible and inconspicuous to the people rushing past “watching the world’s parade, its wealth and hurry”. He observes it all and reports back to the Dull Men’s Club. “Though the world may not stop for me, I will not stop for it. I am here, still breathing, still remembering. And that in itself, is something.”While he usually posts daily, other dull people get concerned if he doesn’t post for a while. They miss him, his wisdom and his beautiful writing.In his introduction to the 2024 Dull Men’s Club calendar, Click wrote: “What they [the dull men] are doing is referred to in Japan asikigai.It gives a sense of purpose, a motivating force. A reason to jump out of bed in the morning.”Here is a radical thought. Dull men (and women) are actually interesting.

Later photograph: Pål Hansen/The Guardian. Styling: Andie Redman. Hair and makeup: Alice Theobald at Arlington Artists. Archive photograph: Sheila RockBorn in 1944 in Plymouth, Angela Rippon is a British journalist, newsreader and presenter. Her career began at 17 as a photojournalist for the Western Morning News. In 1975, she became the first female journalist to permanently present the BBC national news; she has since hosted Top Gear, Antiques Roadshow and Rip-Off Britain as well as becoming the oldest contestant to compete on Strictly Come Dancing, in 2023. She is an ambassador for the Alzheimer’s Society and is supporting the charity’sForget Me Not appeal.This photo was takenfor the cover of the 1980s exercise LP Shape Up and Dance. Normally, I would have had bare feet if I were dancing, but the producers asked me to wear little pink shoes, which seemed incongruous. Nevertheless, I was quite happy in this outfit. What’s fascinating is that I still meet women who ask me, “Have you got a spare copy? Mine’s worn out.”At the time, I was married and living in Devon. I had a horse, two dogs and two cats, and a large garden. I was just about to stop reading the news as I was going to be one of the “famous five” on ITV’s TV-am, along with Michael Parkinson, David Frost, Anna Ford and Robert Kee. We’d not had breakfast television in Britain before, so the show felt quite revolutionary. It all ended in tears, however, because they decided they couldn’t afford Anna and me, which was crazy. As we discovered subsequently, we were the cheapest of the five. But they still got rid of us.For a whole year after this debacle, I thought my career was over. In fact, one of the BBC executives is on record as saying, “Angela Rippon will never work for the BBC again.” Back then there was no way that if you worked for ITV, you could also work for BBC. Then, one day my agent called and said, “Angela, how would you like to work in America?” I was flown to Boston and became an arts and entertainment correspondent for WHDH-TV. I eventually returned home, armed with an Emmy I had won for a documentary I’d made, and I was able to work again. That whole period was very chaotic, at times scary, but exciting. What would I have done if it was the end of my career? I would have just picked up a camera and applied for jobs as a photojournalist again.There were jobs I wouldn’t let my mother know about – such as when I went diving with great white sharksEsther Rantzen, who’s a great mate, and her husband, Desmond, when he was alive, always used to say, “I don’t know anybody who’s reinvented themselves as much as you.” I don’t see it as reinventing. It’s just that I’ve been around for a long time, and as television has evolved, I’ve been fortunate to be able to move with it. Take, for example, when I appeared on the Morecambe and Wise Christmas show in 1976. Certain people in the press asked, “How can you ever go back to reading the news again?” If I’d gone back to the desk wearing dangly earrings and sequins, yes, maybe there would have been a problem. But just because newsreaders broadcast doom and gloom, it doesn’t mean that is who we are. There’s another side to our characters, and maybe I opened the door to show that we’re all human underneath.No matter where I wasor what I was doing, I would ring my parents every week. There were jobs I wouldn’t let my mother, Edna, know about. Such as when I went diving with great white sharks. Or when I went to Northern Ireland – a dangerous place to work in the 1970s.In 2003, I had just come off air at LBC when I noticed lots of missed calls from my mum. When I called her back, she said, “Angela, you’ve got to be very brave, but your father’s died.” He’d had a massive heart attack. My parents had been married for 62 years and they were joined at the hip. His death was a huge blow for my mum. After that, she started to have transient ischemic attacks – mini strokes – and I think that’s what triggered her dementia. Gradually, her behaviour became more erratic and her character changed. She became agoraphobic and very distrustful of people. She used to have bursts of temper and say the most terrible things. In 2004, a doctor told us she had vascular dementia and had been declining for about a year. She died in 2009.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

When he died it was terrible, monumental’Read moreIt took me a long time to realise how this disease was going to affect her and what it was going to mean for me as her main carer. Not many people talked about dementia publicly in the 2000s, and I remember being interviewed by someone from the Daily Mail. The journalist said to me, “Aren’t you embarrassed to be talking about this?” I said, “No, why should I be? This is a disease of the brain. It’s the brain being eaten away and dying.” There was such a stigma back then, and it is so important we do not keep dementia hidden.I had to learn quickly that you can’t take offence when someone with dementia says something cruel. Instead, you work with it. There was one occasion when my mum was in hospital and I could hear her before I got into the ward. She was screaming and being very abusive to the nurse, who was trying to take her blood pressure. I walked in and said, “Mummy, play nice.” She started shouting at me, “Get me out of this place. What have you put me in here for?” I just let her rage for a little while, and then I said, “Mummy, I’ve just come from home, and I have to tell you, the camellias are looking amazing at the moment. The garden is fantastic.” That brought her down, and I asked the nurse to bring her a cup of tea. When she came back, my mother said, “Angela, have you met my young friend here? She’s the nicest nurse on the ward.”When it comes to getting older, I have decided I want to age disgracefully. It’s much more fun. Age is just a number on a piece of paper and I have to keep energised to do my job. I covered Her Majesty the Queen’s funeral for Australian television and I was on air live for over 14 hours. We had to start at two o’clock in the morning. You can’t do that if you’re not fit.How do I stay in shape? I still dance – I go to ballet class, and I do pilates. Yesterday, at tennis, there were four of us playing doubles and I was the youngest. We played for two hours. Diet is important, too. I have an intolerance to dairy products, so I have hot water with lemon, herb teas, or maybe just a couple of cups of black coffee, and lots and lots of water.When this was taken, I would not have expected to still be working at 80. My accountant laughs at me all the time because ever since I was 50, I’ve been saying, “Well, I may not be working next year.” Of course, there will be a point at which I retire. The moment I think, “Ah, for crying out loud, I really don’t want to do this today,” I’ll know it’s over. Or maybe the phone will just stop ringing. What then? I’ll adopt a dog. A mature one – there’s no point in me having a puppy as I’m single and I should die before it. But for now there’s no need.I still wake up every morning, stretch for 10 minutes, and think, “Excellent. Another great day ahead.”Explore more on these topicsLife and styleFlashbackTelevisionPhotographyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

For Labour, the stakes couldn’t be higherSun 8 Jun 2025 07.36 EDTLast modified on Sun 8 Jun 2025 13.55 EDTShareIhave got used to a scene that has been repeated in wildly different places all over the UK. Close to the centre of a town or city, there will be a construction project, centred on the delivery of brand new apartments. The air will be filled with the loud clanking of machinery; a hastily finished show flat might offer a glimpse of what is to come.I have developed an unexpected addiction to these places, always photographing the hoardings that hide building work from passersby, which usually feature ecstatic thirtysomethings drinking coffee and relaxing in upmarket domestic environments (they are usually accompanied by slogans like “live, work, relax, dream”). And I have come to expect a kind of encounter that goes straight to the heart of one of our biggest national problems. Up will walk a member of the public, looking sceptically at what is under way. Their words may vary but the basic message is always the same: “Who’s this for? Not me.”Atthe last count, 1.3m households in England were on local authority housing waiting lists, the highest figure since 2014. About164,000 childrenlive in temporary accommodation. Average rent increases in the private sector recentlyhit a record highof 9.2%.Figures just releasedby the Home Builders Federation show that the number of new homes given planning consent in England in the first quarter of 2025 was the lowest since 2012, something partly blamed on the absence of any government support scheme for first-time buyers. The market for homes people can buy remains a byword for exclusion and impossibility, which is why those new apartment blocks are always such a dependable symbol of fury and frustration.The same anger has long since seeped into our politics. Fifteen years ago, I can vividly recallreporting from the London borough of Barking and Dagenhamabout chronic housing problems caused by themass sell-off of council houses, and the area’s increasingly toxic politics. A 60-year-old owner of a bakery told me about her daughter, who lived with her four-year-old son in a privately rented flat full of pigeon droppings that had apparently made him chronically ill. They were on the council waiting list. “But every time,” she told me, “she’s, like, number 200 or 300.”She and her husband, she said, were going to vote for the neo-fascist British National party. At the time, it felt as if what I was seeing still sat at the outer edge of politics. But these days, the same essential story has taken up residence at the heart of the national conversation: the BNP has been chased into irrelevance and protest votes now go en masse toReform UK, and the connection between the housing crisis and the febrile state of the political mainstream is obvious. Certainly, it’s impossible to grasp the salience of immigration without appreciating many people’s visceral feelings about the scarcity of homes.In the inner circles of Keir Starmer’s government, there must be voices keenly aware of the need to finally tackle all this. Some of the right instincts were evident in Labour’s promise to oversee the building of1.5m new homesin England by the end of this parliament. The chancellor has recently reiterated the aim of delivering the“biggest boostin social and affordable housing in a generation”. But what that means and whether any such thing is on its way are still clouded in doubt.The clock is loudly ticking down to this week’s spending review. Last weekend, the Greater Manchester mayor, Andy Burnham, addressed an event put on by the progressive pressure group Compass, and said Rachel Reeves should “unlock public landfor mayors to use to build a new generation of council homes at pace – akin to the drive of the postwar Labour government”.Housing associations have pleadedwith the chancellor to reclassify social homes as critical infrastructure (a category that covers such essentials as food, energy and “data”), which would allow increased funding to fall within her fiscal rules.Meanwhile, Angela Rayner – the minister in charge of housing, who is said to be fiercely attached to the dream of a social housing renaissance – is seemingly locked in intense last-minute negotiations with the Treasury.Although the budget unveiled in March contained an extra £2bn for the government’s affordable homes programme in 2026-27,its own publicity material saidthis was merely “a down payment [sic] … ahead of more long-term investment in social and affordable housing planned this year”.Rayner is reportedly pushing the plain factthat the ever-more doubtful 1.5m target will be missed without much higher funding. We will see what happens on Wednesday, but housing seems to have fallen out of the government’s messaging. Of late, it has seemed that Reeves and Starmer think investments in defence and public transport are a much higher priority than dependable shelter.There is a vital point at the core of this issue. Even if Starmer has often given the impression that the answer to the housing crisis lies in clearing away planning law and letting corporate developers do the work, their ring-road faux-Georgian cul-de-sacs will not provide anything like the entirety of the solution. Social housing – which, at the scale required, needs to be largely the responsibility of councils – is not just what millions of British people need as a matter of urgency; it will also have to be hugely revived if the government is to meet its aims: 1.5m homes in a single parliament equates to 300,000 a year. The last time such a feat materialised wasin 1977, when about half of all new-builds were delivered by local authorities.A new version of that story will not be easy to realise. Threadbare councils are in no state to play the role in a housing revival that they need to. The UK is also faced with a dire construction skills crisis: despite the government’s plans to train 60,000 new construction workers,industry insiders are adamantthat we will only build what’s required with the help of building workers from abroad. But failure should not be an option: it will not just deepen this country’s social decay, but also boost malign forces on the hard right, and present a huge obstacle to Labour having any chance of winning the next election.In the midst of last year’s contest,I went to Aldershot, the old garrison town at the centre of a constituency that Labour won from the Tories on a swing of 17 points. Grand buildings once used by generals and majors were full of luxury flats, and the town centre was scattered with empty shops. There, I came across a new development calledUnion Yard, which was on its way to completion. It contained 128 student “units”, 82 properties for private rent, and a mere 18 classified as “affordable” (which, in keeping with one of the grimmest aspects of the politics of housing, means they will be let for no more than 80% of local market rent), set aside for people over the age of 55.Not long before, the waiting list for council homes in the surrounding county of Hampshirehad hit 30,000. On a Tuesday afternoon, I sat facing the images of the high life that adorned the development’s outer edges, and had a long conversation with a twentysomething woman who was full of a striking mixture of sadness and anger. I knew what she was going to say, and it came out pretty much verbatim: “Who’s that for? Not me.”John Harris is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsHousingOpinionSocial housingInequalityCommunitiesLabourReform UKEnglandcommentShareReuse this content"

After tweaking her fiscal rules last autumn, she has an additional £113bn funded by borrowing for capital spending.Her plans will include £86bn for science and technology across four years and an extra £4.5bn for schools – taking funding per pupil to its highest level ever.However, day-to-day spending is more constrained in some areas, while theNHSand defence swallow up higher allocations.As well as policing, the Home Office budget covers Border Force and spending on asylum costs, while the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government has been battling for funds for the affordable homes programme, councils, homelessness and regional growth.Labour has manifesto pledges to build 1.5m homes and deliver 13,000 new police officers.Pressed on the policing budget, the technology secretary, Peter Kyle, said Home Office and others would have to “do their bit”.Funding for the police has the potential to become a politically difficult issue for Keir Starmer. Tory former shadow cabinet minister Robert Jenrick has been campaigning against transport fare dodging and Nigel Farage’s Reform UK party is also highlighting the issue.Asked about which public services will be prioritised, Kyle said “every part of our society is struggling” and numerous sectors had asked Reeves for more money.“On the fact that the police have been writing to the chancellor, they have,” he told the BBC’s Sunday With Laura Kuenssberg programme. “We also have letters from the universities, we have letters from doctors about the health service, we have letters from campaigners for child poverty writing to us, and other aspects of challenges in Britain at the moment.“Every part of our society is struggling because of the inheritance that we had as a country and as a government.”He pointed to the £1.1bn extra funding already earmarked for police this year, as he defended Reeves’s handling of the spending review process.“We expect the police to start embracing the change they need to do, to do their bit for change as well. We are doing our bit,” Kyle said.“You see a chancellor that is striving to get investment to the key parts of our country that needs it the most … You will see the priorities of this government reflected in the spending review, which sets the departmental spending into the long term.“But this is a partnership. Yes, the Treasury needs to find more money for those key priorities, but the people delivering them need to do their bit as well.”While some areas of spending may be cut or receive only low increases, the NHS is set to receive an uplift of up to £30bn by 2028, while defence spending is expected to rise to 2.5% of GDP by 2027.Kyle defended the chancellor’s approach to public spending, saying she was like Apple co-founder Steve Jobs who turned the company around when it was 90 days from insolvency.He told Sky News’ Trevor Phillips: “Now Steve Jobs turned it around by inventing the iMac, moving to a series of products like the iPod.“Now we’re starting to invest in the vaccine processes of the future. Some of the hi-tech solutions that are going to be high growth. We’re investing in our space sector. All these really high, highly innovative sectors.“We are investing into those key innovations of the future. We know that we cannot break this vicious cycle of high tax and low growth by doing the same as we always have done. We have to innovate our way out of this and we are doing so by investing in those high-growth sectors.”As part of the government’s drive to innovate, Starmer will on Monday unveil a plan to train a million schoolchildren and seven million workers in artificial intelligence (AI) at a cost of £187m.Speaking at UK Tech Week, Starmer will say the government is“putting the power of AI into the hands of the next generation – so they can shape the future, not be shaped by it”.“This training programme will unlock opportunity in every classroom – and lays the foundations for a new era of growth,” he will say. “Too many children from working families like the one I grew up in are written off. I am determined to end that.”The Tories accused Labour of copying their own plans in office over the commitment to £86bn of science spending, and also said they would cut welfare spending to save money for extra policing.Liberal Democrat leader Ed Davey called on the chancellor to rule out any cuts to social care funding at this week’s spending review, warning they would be “devastating” for those in need of care.Explore more on these topicsEconomic policyRachel ReevesNHSLabournewsShareReuse this content"

For most other players in the history of tennis, there was no reason to believe in any outcome other than defeat.In his short time competing in the biggest matches of his sport, ­however, Alcaraz has made it clear that he is different to anyone who has come before him, both in the way he approaches his tennis and the unwavering belief that underpins his ­success. Alcaraz recovered and pulled off one of the greatest comebacks in the history of the sport, in an otherworldly confrontation, spectacularly toppling the world No 1,Jannik Sinner, 4-6, 6-7 (4), 6-4, 7-6 (3), 7-6 (10-2) after five hours and 29 minutes to defend his French Open title in Paris.Carlos Alcaraz: ‘The match is not finished until he wins the last point’Read moreEven before this moment, the greatest in his career so far, Alcaraz has built a reputation for maintaining his self-belief even when facing ­desperate deficits. He had already saved a significant match point against Sinner, pulling off an unforgettable recovery at 3am in their2022 US Open quarter-final en route to his first major title. His five-set escape against Novak Djokovic in the2023 Wimbledon finalwas an instant classic. None of that compares to the madness that unfolded here in the final match of the tournament.At 22, Alcaraz is the third‑youngest man in history to win five grand slam titles, following in the footsteps of Björn Borg and Rafael Nadal. As the eighth man in the open era to ­successfully defend a Roland ­Garros title, he completes an ­incredible clay‑court season where he has compiled a 19-0 record at big tournaments, winning Masters 1000 titles in Monte Carlo and Rome before this phenomenal victory in Paris. It only took the longest French Open final in the open era for him to achieve this.After years of hype and ­expectation surrounding the rivalry between Alcaraz and Sinner, this occasion ­signified their long-awaited first grand slam final as they have established themselves as the two leading players in the sport. At the beginning of a new era in men’s tennis, they have set the bar in the stratosphere.View image in fullscreenJannik Sinner is consoled by Andre Agassi, who won the French Open in 1999, after his painful defeat by Carlos Alcaraz.Photograph: Denis Balibouse/ReutersBefore the final, Sinner had been the best performer in the draw, ­rolling through all opponents to reach the semi-finals before ­defeating the 24-time grand slam title winner­Djokovic in three bruising sets. He was 47-2 against players since August, but Alcaraz was responsible for those two defeats.Despite how hard Alcaraz tried, he could not halt Sinner’s momentum as the Italian established a two-set lead. Still, he kept on going. Throughout the third set, he repeatedly called on the crowd to carry him through. He retrieved the break and rolled to a 5-2 lead, his level rising and his mind clearing. As he closed out the set with a break for 6-4 to keep his hopes alive, Alcaraz cupped his ears to the crowd and let their ­adoration wash over him.Sinner quickly reestablished control in the fourth set, marching to a 5-3 lead and reaching triple championship point on Alcaraz’s serve. One point from the end of his reign at Roland Garros, with seemingly the entire audience urging him on, the moment drew the Spaniard’s unwavering focus. He played every single shot with discipline and care, methodically eradicating the match points before slamming the door shut with a searing forehand winner. Then he met the moment with a supreme return game as Sinner’s first serve and legs faltered. In the blink of an eye, Alcaraz had swung the match from 3-5, 0-40, to 6-5. As Alcaraz walked back to his chair at the change of ends, he pumped his fists to the sky.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

His strong serving set the tone early and he unleashed his forehand whenever the opportunity presented itself. As the tie-break endured and the frenzied crowd spurred Alcaraz on, ­Sinner gradually lost his head and his legs as Alcaraz forced a fifth set.In just his second tournament back after his three‑month doping ban, Sinner’s physical condition was always uncertain. By the start of the final set, he had faded physically and he immediately lost his serve. But he kept on going. Sinner made Alcaraz work for every service game and as Alcaraz stepped up to serve for the match himself, Sinner spectacularly broke back for 5-5.With everything on the line after well over five hours on court, both men spent the final stages swinging as freely as they could, leaving nothing to doubt. Up 6-5 in the fifth, Sinner placed Alcaraz under relentless pressure in a lengthy deuce game, again moving to within two points of victory. Alcaraz ­weathered the storm yet again, finding a backhand passing-shot winner to hold serve before marching through the championship tie-break to an astounding victory that further bolsters his status as one of the most special young talents this sport has seen.Explore more on these topicsFrench Open 2025Carlos AlcarazJannik SinnerFrench OpenTennismatch reportsShareReuse this content"

He was sentenced to an indefinite hospital order after pleading guilty to manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility as a result of paranoid schizophrenia and three counts of attempted murder.It was announced in February that prosecutors, police and medical professionalswould be scrutinised in the two-year inquiry, including the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC).Grace’s father, Dr Sanjoy Kumar, said that an IOPC regional director had behaved inappropriately when the bereaved families met the watchdog in March 2024, including by starting the meeting with a prayer.“I found it patronising and offensive,” Kumar told the Sunday Times. “I didn’t want a prayer, I wanted answers. I’ve lost my daughter and it was his job to give me the truth, not a prayer.“There are plenty of places to pray and the IOPC isn’t one of them.”The regional director at the meeting, Derrick Campbell, is now the watchdog’s director of engagement, the newspaper reported.An IOPC spokesperson said: “We can confirm we’ve received a complaint about one of our directors and we are dealing with it in line with our complaints and feedback procedure.”The watchdog previously prepared a report that concluded Leicestershire police officers had failed to properly investigate an assault on warehouse workers by Calocane which could have stopped his killing spree a month later. Three officers were due to face a misconduct meeting but the force postponed this.In March, the IOPC said it would reinvestigate whetherCalocane’s previous history and an outstanding arrest warrantwere seen by officers before the investigation was closed down.The watchdog said it had made its decision “after the force provided new evidence, which had not previously been available to the IOPC” and “representations by the bereaved families which led to further inquiries with Leicestershire police”.Explore more on these topicsNottinghamIndependent Office for Police ConductnewsShareReuse this content"

The Jamaica-born official grew up in Sheffield and oversaw more than 300 top-flight matches, starting with his breakthrough appointment as Derby hosted Wimbledon in August 1997. The game was, however, abandoned due to floodlight failure.The Sheffield and Hallamshire County Football Association posted on X: “We are deeply saddened to learn of the passing of our former chair and trailblazing referee, Uriah Rennie. Uriah made history as the Premier League’s first black referee, officiating over 300 top-flight matches between 1997 and 2008. He broke down barriers, shaped our football community and inspired generations to come. Our thoughts are with Uriah’s family and friends at this difficult time.”Rennie became a Fifa-listed referee in 2000 and joined the select group of professionals one year later. He told BBC News in April how, while on holiday in Turkey last year, he felt severe pain in his back and doctors discovered he had an inoperable neurological condition that left him wheelchair-bound.“I spent a month laid on my back and another four months sitting in bed,” he said. “They kept me in hospital until February, they found a nodule pushing on my spine and it was a rare neurological condition so it’s not something they can operate on.”The former Liverpool and Nottingham Forest striker Stan Collymore posted on X: “Incredibly sad to hear of the passing of referee Uriah Rennie.

He watched martial artists slug it out behind a chain-link fence. A female champion let the US president try on her gold belt. It was a night of machismo, spectacle and violence.Shortly before he joined an Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) event in Newark, New Jersey, on Saturday night, Trump hadsigned an orderdeploying 2,000 national guard troops to Los Angeles, where protests sparked by sweeping immigration raids led to clashes between authorities and demonstrators.US national guard arrive in Los Angeles after protests over immigration raidsRead moreThe White House said Trump was sending in the guardsmen to “address the lawlessness that has been allowed to fester” in California. Governor Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, said the move was “purposefully inflammatory and will only escalate tensions”. Experts said it was the first time in 60 years that a president has activated astate’s national guard– a reserve military – without a request from its governor.Critics also saw it as an authoritarian flex by a strongman president who has relentlesslytrampled norms and burst through guardrails. Since returning to office in January, Trump has sought to crush dissent at cultural institutions, law firms, media companies and universities. Many believed it was only a matter of time before he took the fight to the streets.The protests against Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) raids present him with an antagonist that can be used as a focal point for anger, hatred and fear, ensuring that dissent is redirected away from the government and toward “an enemy within”. Trump is the master of distraction and, with the help of lurid rightwing media clips, wants to divert attention from policy failures and hisugly feud with Elon Musk.Chris Murphy, a Democratic senator,tweeted: “Important to remember that Trump isn’t trying to heal or keep the peace. He is looking to inflame and divide. His movement doesn’t believe in democracy or protest – and if they get a chance to end the rule of law they will take it. None of this is on the level.”As with much else in his scorched earth second term, Trump advertised this in advance. Last Octoberhe told Fox News: “I always say, we have two enemies. We have the outside enemy, and then we have the enemy from within, and the enemy from within, in my opinion, is more dangerous than China, Russia and all these countries.”He added: “We have some very bad people. We have some sick people. Radical left lunatics I think it should be very easily handled by, if necessary, by National Guard, or if really necessary, by the military, because they can’t let that happen.”There are echoes of 2020 when Trump used national guard troops in Washington toquell Black Lives Matter proteststhat arose after George Floyd was killed by Minneapolis police officers. The troops fired teargas to clear peaceful protesters from Lafayette Square near the White House to allow Trump to stage a photo-op at a church.The former defense secretary Mark Esperlater revealedthat Trump asked about the protesters: “Can’t you just shoot them?Just shoot them in the legs or something?”Trump and his rightwing allies have been busy rewriting the history of 2020 as a flashpoint when rioters brought carnage to US cities. Yet their narrative omits Trump’s conspicuous failure to active the national guard in response to his supporters’ attempt to overturn his election defeat bylaying siege to the US Capitolon January 6 2021.Cory Booker, a Democratic senator for New Jersey, told NBC’s Meet the Press programme on Sunday: “We are now at a point where we have a president who sat back and did nothing as people stormed our Capitol, viciously beat police, and then when those people – who viciously beat police and led to some of their deaths, therefore cop killers – were convicted by juries, he then pardoned them all.“So for him to be talking to anybody right now about responsible law enforcement to protect people is hypocritical at best.”Now California – a Democrat-dominated state regularly invoked by Trump and his allies as a hive of “wokeness” and immigration lawlessness – is the ideal target for Trump to whip up the fervor and resentments of his base. The government is deploying the national guard “not because there is a shortage of law enforcement, but because they want a spectacle,”Newsom wrote on social media. “Don’t give them one.”In a sign of how much has changed from his first term, there are no Mark Espers to push back this time. Instead the current defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, threatened to involve regular military forces, writing that active duty Marines at Camp Pendleton were on high alert and would also be mobilized “if violence continues”.And Stephen Miller, a White House deputy chief of staff and architect of Trump’s draconian immigration crackdown,posted messagessuch as “We will take back America” and “Insurrection” – the latter raising the spectre of Trump invoking the Insurrection Act, one of the most powerful emergency powers at the disposal of a president.The 18th-century wartime law would allow Trump to deploy the military on US soil against civilian protests, evoking parallels with autocratic regimes around the world that declare martial law. Again, the president has teed up a preview: on Saturday tanks will roll on the streets of Washingtonfor a paradeto celebrate the 250th anniversary of the US army.It also happens to be Trump’s birthday.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpTrump administrationLos AngelesUS immigrationUS politicsanalysisShareReuse this content"

Sir Mark Rowley, the head of the Metropolitan police, and other senior police officers have also written to the prime minister to warn him that investment was need to prevent some crimes being routinely ignored. It is understand the policing budget will not face real terms cuts but the level of spending is still under discussion.The Home Office is under strain as a major spending department that is key to some of the most ambitious manifesto pledges – including halving knife crime, police recruitment, reducing violence against women and girls as well as dealing with monitoring offenders who will be released earlier due to sentencing changes.HousingThe other major spending review row is over deep dissatisfaction from Angela Rayner – the deputy prime minister and housing secretary – with the level of funding for social homes in the spending review, making her one of the last remaining holdouts in negotiations with the Treasury over departmental spending settlements.The Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government has been battling for more funding for the affordable homes programme as well as trying to preserve cash for local councils, homelessness and regional growth initiatives.The Treasury had previouslyput £2bn into affordable housing, described as a “down payment” on further funding to be announced at the spending review, which Reeves said would mark a generational shift in the building of council homes.However, the next phase of funding has caused a major rift with Rayner – and more so because capital spending on infrastructure such as housing is meant to be a priority.EnvironmentThe environment secretary, Steve Reed, is said to have been holding out for a big capital injection to fund flood defences. The autumn budget said the government was facing significant funding pressures on flood defences and farm schemes of almost £600m in 2024-25, and that those schemes would have to be reviewed for their affordability.Sources at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) confirmed a post-Brexit farming fund would be cut in the review. Labour promised a fund of £5bn over two years – from 2024 to 2026 – at the budget, which is being honoured, but in the years after that it will be slashed for all but a few farms.Net zeroThe energy secretary, Ed Miliband, had a long fight to keep cash for a major programme of insulation, which was a key part of the government’s net zero strategy. However, there are reports suggesting other schemes could be scaled back to protect the insulation programme.At the October budget, Reeves announced £3.4bn over three years for household energy efficiency schemes, heat decarbonisation and fuel poverty schemes. The government responded to concerns expressed at the time calling the sum the “bare minimum” and promising a spending uplift at the review.Miliband’s department is expected to get significant capital investment in energy infrastructure including nuclear – with the government poised to give the go ahead to the Sizewell C nuclear plant.TransportThe chancellor has already announced £15bn in transport spending across the north of England, funds which she said fulfil promises made by the Conservatives to the country but which the party had no way to pay for them in its own plan.HealthWes Streeting’s department is set to be one of the big winners of the spending review and it will lay the groundwork for the NHS 10-year plan, which will be published imminently after the spending review. The department will get one of the biggest boosts to funding as others face real-terms cuts.The funding for the plan prioritises three key areas, moving care from hospitals to communities, increasing the use of technology, and prioritising prevention.No 10 and Streeting hope that the 10-year plan will contain major commitments and a positive story that the government will finally be able to tell properly on improvements to the health service – though any good news could be scuppered by the ballot for strike action by resident doctors.Still, Streeting’s department was one of the last to settle formally with the Treasury due to negotiations over drug prices, though departmental sources downplayed any specific row.EducationAny child in England whose parents receive universal credit will be able to claim free school meals from September 2026, the government has said. Parents on the credit will be eligible regardless of their income. The government says the change will make 500,000 more pupils eligible.A Department for Education (DfE) source said it was the best measure outside welfare changes to address child poverty and that the education secretary, Bridget Phillipson, had consistently fought to protect school food programmes through each round of spending negotiations.But schools budgets will be squeezed. Teachers will get a 4% pay rise next year, with additional funding of £615m. But schools will still have to fund about a quarter of the rise themselves – a total of £400m from their current budgets.Phillipson has tasked the DfE with finding savings in schools budgets, such as energy bills.Savings will also come as the government is removing public funding for level 7 apprenticeships, which has drawn criticism from skills experts.JusticeThe justice secretary, Shabana Mahmood, was one of the first to reach her settlement to allow her to announce a £4.7bn plan to build three new prisons starting this year, part of a “record expansion” as the government attempts to get to grips with the prison crisis.The early announcement was essential because it came alongside an announcement that the government would put alimiton how long hundreds of repeat offenders can be recalled to prison amid Whitehall predictions that jails will be full again in November.Explore more on these topicsEconomic policyRachel ReevesTax and spendingLabourexplainersShareReuse this content"

Think of sleeper trains, boat trains, vintage steam railways, elegant dining cars. But it’s rare that an urban transport system can capture the imagination quite as much as the Wuppertal Schwebebahn in Germany caught mine, and that of anyone else who’s clapped eyes on the world’s oldest suspended railway.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.In October it will be 125 years since Kaiser Wilhelm II took a test ride in the Schwebebahn, just a few months before the hanging railway officially opened for business in March 1901. It was an incredible feat of engineering then, and remains so today. Even with sleek modern carriages having long replaced the original ones, it looks like something imagined by Jules Verne, with carriages smoothly gliding under the overhead track. They have even preserved the first 1901 carriage, nicknamed Kaiserwagen, which can be hired for private occasions.As the hanging train sways above the river, it turns this commuter service into something like a fairground rideA childlike feeling of glee filled me as I sat in the rear of the long carriage and watched the city reveal itself as I floated anything from 8 to 9 metres (26ft to 39ft) above it. At the railway’s westernmost end, Vohwinkel is the first of only four stations whose carriages run above the street, between iron arches. The rest of the railway, which in total runs for just over eight miles, follows the route of the river Wupper. As the hanging train curves and sways above the serpentine river, it turns this commuter service into something like a fairground ride for its 80,000 daily passengers. My hitherto unknown train geek had been unleashed and was utterly delighted.View image in fullscreenThe Schwebebahn railway follows the route of the River Wupper.Photograph: Hackenberg-Photo-Cologne/AlamyThe Schwebebahn came about almost by accident. The Wupper valley, about 15 miles east of Düsseldorf, was a major textile production base when Germany was undergoing its own Industrial Revolution in the 19th century. As workers flooded to the growing cities of Barmen and Elberfeld – which merged in 1929 and were renamed Wuppertal in 1930 – the authorities realised a public transport system was needed. Other cities were going underground, but Wuppertal’s rocky soil and narrow, steep valley made any sort of U-Bahn impossible, forcing the Schwebebahn’s inventor, Eugen Langen, to look up instead.At Schwebodrom, the railway museum that opened in late 2023 near Werther Brücke station at the line’s eastern end, the rich history of the Schwebebahn is laid out in three galleries, revealing one fascinating detail after another. One gallery tells the story of Tuffi, a young circus elephant loaded into the Schwebebahn for a publicity stunt in 1950. Poor Tuffi was so spooked by jostling journalists that she bolted through a window and tumbled into the river. Luckily she was only lightly bruised and lived for another 49 years, her landing spot in the Wupper now marked by an elephant statue between Alter Markt and Adler Brücke stations. You can’t move in Wuppertal without seeing Tuffi on some souvenir or another – even on milk cartons.Among the museum’s films and displays, the highlight for me was the reproduction of an original carriage, where I sat glued to my VR headset and found myself in 1920s Wuppertal. After riding the rails in real life, I was able to go back in time to see what had changed. Much of Wuppertal had to be rebuilt after heavy allied bombing in the second world war, and the railway itself has been completely reconstructed – including its art nouveau stations – while keeping the original steampunk-style design in the iron girders.View image in fullscreenLaurentiusplatz, Wuppertal.Photograph: ©Adam BatterbeeBut there is a Wuppertal beyond the Schwebebahn, and this city of about 350,000 people was as full of pleasant surprises as its railway. Local guide Heike Fragemann took me to the tree-lined streets around Laurentiusplatz, a square dominated by the austere-looking 19th-century basilica of St Lawrence, dedicated to Wuppertal’s patron saint. Popular with many of the 23,000 students at the University of Wuppertal as well as people of all ages, the cosmopolitan streets hummed with cafes, delis, boutiques, bars and restaurants run by some of the many nationalities that have settled here over the decades – Italian, Turkish, Greek, Indian, Vietnamese and Spanish among them. In fact, the range of restaurants throughout the city was huge, and also included Lebanese, Chinese, Croatian and traditional German fare.Sir Simon Rattle rated the acoustics of the Historische Stadthalle concert hall among the best in the worldPointing out an example of Wuppertal’s distinctive style of architecture – slate cladding, green shutters and white window frames – Heike led me along the narrow streets behind Laurentiusplatz as we steadily walked uphill. Not only was Wuppertal Germany’s Manchester because of its industry, Heike told me, but it was also compared to San Francisco thanks to its steepness. “We are the city of steps,” she said as we came to yet another one. “We have 500 staircases, more than 12,000 steps within the city. This is the most famous one.” She pointed to a sign with the captivating name of Tippen-Tappen-Tönchen, in honour of those 19th-century workmen clopping in their wooden clogs towards the riverside factories – hence the tipping-tapping sound. One to add to my list of adorable street names.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe TravellerFree newsletterGet travel inspiration, featured trips and local tips for your next break, as well as the latest deals from Guardian HolidaysEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The Von der Heydt Museum, named after an art-collecting banking family, houses its impressive collection of 19th- and early 20th-century art in what had been the neoclassical town hall. The entrance is flanked by two large sculptures by the Liverpool-born Turner prize-winner Tony Cragg, who made Wuppertal his home in 1977. The Historische Stadthalle concert hall, marking its 125th anniversary this year, had Richard Strauss as one of its first conductors and Sir Simon Rattle rated its acoustics among the best in the world. Public gardens fill many of the gaps in the city, including the vast hilly Botanical Garden.As I sat in the warm, bookish surroundings of Café Engel in Laurentiusplatz, I was reminded of Friedrich Engels, the son of a wealthy Wuppertal textile manufacturer, who turned his back on his bourgeois background to co-author The Communist Manifesto with Karl Marx after seeing the appalling working conditions in mid-19th-century Manchester. Engels died in London six years before the Schwebebahn opened, and it was many years earlier that the city’s industrialists had already implemented social reforms for working-class residents that were ahead of their time. The Schwebebahn, too, looks like something from the future, but its story is purely of Wuppertal’s unique past.

This time round, it’s the 1990s, the locations are sunnier and the action has gone internationalRebecca NicholsonSun 8 Jun 2025 17.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 8 Jun 2025 21.02 EDTShareAt the end of the first series of The Gold, it dawned on the officers of the Met’s Flying Squad that for all of their multiple investigations into the infamous Brink’s-Mat robbery of 1983, they had only ever been chasing half of the stolen bullion. Arriving two years after its highly entertaining predecessor, series two sets off with an irresistible premise: what exactly happened to the rest of it?The trouble is that the show doesn’t know the answer, though it freely admits this. None of the gold has ever been recovered, but a note at the beginning explains that the series is based on both real events and theories as to where the loot went. As before, some of the characters are real and some invented. The focus, this time, is on bringing down the ones who got away. The police are hot on the heels of the charming rogue John Palmer (Tom Cullen), AKA “Goldfinger”, who talked his way out of a conviction so convincingly in series one. They’re also trying to track down Charlie Miller (Sam Spruell), a fictional amalgam of various south London villains, who has come away from the robbery with a lot of gold to hide and only loose ideas of what to do with it.The first series, set in the 1980s, was a classic cops-and-robbers drama, and as a result, was more contained and more thrilling. The second series moves the action to the 1990s, and has to work harder, at least initially. It follows the money through a sprawling network of villains, some small-time, some so big-time that at one point we take a detour to the country then called Burma. (I’m sure the cast who were stuck on the Isle of Man felt no resentment whatsoever towards the actors who ended up mostly in Tenerife.)The Gold review – a 24-carat drama about one of the UK’s most shocking robberiesRead moreFor the first couple of episodes, The Gold seems uneasy with this new sense of unharnessed scale. It starts out like an instalment of The Famous Five, or Scooby-Doo, as Miller heads for the disused tin mines of Cornwall. But it soon drags its attention back to the money trail and the investigation, still led by Det Supt Brian Boyce (Hugh Bonneville at his best). The police work has been going on for so long that he and his team are losing the support of their superiors, who are trying to shut them down. These scenes feel a little stuck, a little repetitive, lacking the excitement of the robbery and its immediate aftermath. That is, until Palmer begins to flaunt his wealth and muscle his way into the English establishment.The Gold has always had something to chew on about who belongs where, and who gets to do what. The establishment and the underworld are rarely as distinct as you might think, the series seems to say, an idea that on occasion muddies the waters of who you are supposed to be rooting for. Miller is perceived as a “knuckle-dragger” by Douglas Baxter, a disgraced Cambridge graduate and tax whiz whom Miller tasks with cleaning the dirty money. Joshua McGuire – a standout – plays Baxter with a snivelling haughtiness as repellent as it is pathetic. In fact, this is filled with thunderingly good performances, both billed and in the form of a few surprise appearances, which should please fans of series one.Any sense of triumph, of thieves luxuriating in their ill-gotten gains, is soon swallowed up by paranoia, and by episode three, the claustrophobia experienced by those involved in Brink’s-Mat is palpable. Palmer’s timeshare business in Tenerife is hiding a multitude of sins, and when the Russians arrive, it’s fair to say that his work-life balance tips in an unfavourable direction. Miller, meanwhile, directs his attention towards the Virgin Islands, and a network of old boys to which he does not belong. For Palmer and Miller, the bubble can only get so big before it bursts, and the series revels in slowly turning the screws on them.The Gold is still prone to giving its characters lengthy speeches, in order to explain their belief system or philosophy of life, but that quirk has become as much a part of the series as sweaty detectives shouting “nick ’im!”, or indistinct timeframes indicated by captions like “a few years ago”. But there is an overwhelming sense that this is Good Quality BritishDrama, despite the inevitable sprawl that comes with a story wandering across the Canaries, the Caribbean, Asia, the Isle of Man and London. For the most part, it is focused and newly thrilling. And despite having no obvious ending to draw from in real life, The Gold manages to cobble one together, with gusto.The Gold aired onBBCOne and is on iPlayer now in the UK, and is on Stan in Australia.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewHugh BonnevilleDramaBBCreviewsShareReuse this content"

Some are wearing full-coverage unitards, others leave slices of midriff bare. No one is wearing a baggy T-shirt from2008 with a naked Rufus Wainwright on it, and hardened flecks of damp-proof paint. Except me.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.If TikTok is to be believed, my gym-mates must be millennials, born between the early 1980s and the mid-1990s; gen Z would find such skin-tightness a bit retro, or basic, or even“jurassic fitness”.Another generational schism has opened online– to add tosocks,jeansandboundaries– this time over what millennials and gen Z are wearing to work out in. Tight-on-tight outfits supposedly single you out as a millennial – it is “giving middle school”, said one gen Z user witheringly – while gen Z prefers something baggier. Looking around me at pilates and in the park, though, I suspect some of the women wearing a second, seal-like skin are younger than 30. And here I am, days after turning 40 – squarely a millennial – wearing an enormous T-shirt. It is a muddled picture.Kelechi Okafor – at 38, a millennial – is a fitness professional, a former personal trainer and the owner of a pole dance studio. She used to wear tighter clothes to exercise but now wears baggy joggers and tops, in the reverse of what TikTok might have you believe. “The way that the tailoring is done for a lot of gymwear does not have my body size in mind,” she says. “There was something liberating about saying: ‘Actually, I’m not wearing this any more. I’m going to wear baggy things.’”Michelle Carroll, a 29-year-old (millennial) body image coach and nutritionist based in Edinburgh, who typically wears leggings and a vest or cropped top, says that at her gym: “Younger people tend to wear brighter, shorter and tighter clothes.” She sees it as “in part, influenced by ‘fitness culture’ we see online – it’s almost a uniform”.View image in fullscreenFitness professional Kelechi Okafor no longer tries to make ill-fitting, tight gymwear work.Photograph: Courtesy of Kelechi OkaforLauren Crowder, managing director ofELEVEN:ELEVEN Studiosin Liverpool city centre, says clients in their 20s and early 30s “tend to embrace the trend of matching activewear sets – brands such as Adanola, Bo+Tee, or Gymshark are really popular” – whereas clients in their late 30s and up “generally prefer a more relaxed fit”. Georgie Burke, founder ofthe Barre Fitness Studio in Bristol, says the younger clients there like “plain colours, white grip ankle socks and tight vest tops” – what she calls the “Adanola aesthetic”, referencing the British activewear brand that seems to be everywhere now, while the 30-plus crowd opt for “a print legging but with a looser style top”.Farther afield, in the Canadian city of Guelph, Samantha Brennan, a professor of philosophy and co-author ofFit at Mid-Life: A Feminist Fitness Journey, has also noticed young women wearing beautiful sets –the kind of “workout bikinis” that some men have been complaining are “intimidating”. It is not so much that they are tight that Brennan notices – though they probably are – but that they all match. Where she sees the gym as “a place where you get to take a break from fashion”, she says, “they’re wearing things I recognise as outfits, and they’re specifically bought for wearing at the gym”.It makes a lot of sense that gym wear is being given as much attention as it is. The gym now has such gravitational pull that for many it is seen as – and this is very much gen Z’s sentiment, not mine – “the new club”.It is a place for socialising and dating; some are calling it “workout-wooing”.Araft of newer brands, such as Toronto’sLiterary Sport, founded by creatives Deirdre Matthews and M Bechara, and Los Angeles’s Everybody.World, set up by former American Apparel employees, may be behind the looser lines, popularising casually-fitting track pants, among other items. Some more longstanding, millennial-coded brands, such as Lululemon, are also now offering baggier fits or“away-from-body styles”, as Lululemon’s chief merchandising officer put it. But, given the often hefty price tags, they appear to be aimed at older exercisers, who are generally more able to afford them. Meanwhile, other brands, such as Sweaty Betty, have been explicitly marketing the idea of wearing tighter, skimpier clothes, at least as part of an exercise ensemble, and disregarding body hang-ups:“Wear the damn shorts” is the tagline from a campaign last year.While the generational divide may feel over-egged, what we wear to exercise reveals a lot about where we are at with body image. Several brands, for example, now dobottoms with “scrunch” designs at the bum, to accentuate curves, because Kardashian-esque glutes remain idealised. It is a style that unites twentysomething “TikTok gym girlies” and celebritiessuch as J-Lo.What you wear to exercise also depends on what exercise you are doing. Reformer pilates – the hyper-expensive and highly engineered full-body workout – makes more sense in cinched styles that won’t get stuck in equipment. A jog in the park, less so. Subtle flares are becoming a thing for yoga, but they would be annoying on a treadmill, and a trip hazard on a squash court.There are also other, shall we say, external factors. “There’s a fear of people taking advantage and hypersexualising and dehumanising folks, particularly women, in these spaces,” saysSamantha Noelle Sheppard, a Cornell professor who writes about sport. What she often sees is a “mix of tight and baggy, like really tight shorts” with an oversized shirt, as a way to keep unwanted eyes off bodies not looking to be objectified. Shakaila Forbes-Bell, a fashion psychologist, has been seeing more conversations among gen Z about wearing baggier clothing for the gym tied to “what is for the male gaze and what is for me”.Again, though, this doesn’t have to be generational. Navi Ahluwalia, an editor at fashion and sportswear site Hypebae, is a millennial who typically goes for “leggings with a baggier top”. While she loves “the way the tighter gym clothes look”, she also hates “the feeling of people looking at me while I exercise, so I personally don’t want to draw any attention to myself – particularly not from creepy men”. I would hazard that most, if not all, women who exercise in public will have had similar thoughts.View image in fullscreen‘A fair few of our clients will stay in activewear all day’ … Georgie Burke at the Barre Fitness Studio.Photograph: The Barre Fitness StudioBurke says: “A fair few of our clients will stay in activewear all day, for coffee, work and the school run, due to our studio being less on the sweaty side.” That tallies with the continued march of gymwear as everyday wear. At least part of this is about comfort; activewear is forgiving when working from home and, at least in my case, practical, when combined with the hope that a trip to the gym (or a 20-minuteYoga with Adriene) is just moments away.It also, consciously or not, broadcasts status. “You think it shows fitness and the idea of an athletic body and a healthy mind,” says Sheppard. “But what it shows is a healthy bank account.” “[It is] meant to be performative in all these different kinds of ways,” she says. “Not only do you look like you have the time to work out, you have the resources to work out – go do your pilates, go do your Peloton class – in a very expensive set.” Looking like a “gym person”, then, perhaps particularly for a younger gen Z crowd, comes with cultural capital.It is not the first time gym gear has been loaded with meaning. Inan article in 2019, New Yorker writer Jia Tolentino posited athleisure as a uniform that represented the principle of “optimisation”: “the process of making something, as the dictionary puts it, ‘as fully perfect, functional, or effective as possible’”.Athleisure, she said, was designed to optimise your appearance at the same time as your performance. But not on everybody.Lululemon founder Chip Wilson made this explicit. “The definition of a brand is that you’re not everything to everybody … You’ve got to be clear that you don’t want certain customers coming in,” he said in a 2013 interview.As Tolentino wrote: “Athleisure broadcasts your commitment to controlling your body through working out.” You create – if indeed you can and you want to – a body that fits athleisure rather than the athleisure moulding to fit you.Okafor looks back to her days of trying to make ill-fitting, tight gymwear work. No matter “how high I pull up the waistband, no matter how much I try to shuffle about with the sports bra, it still doesn’t look right to me”. Clothes seemed to have been designed in a way that wasn’t “honouring” her shape. “It’s just like: ‘Oh, you’re not skinny?’ It’s the thoughtlessness of how these things are made that reinforces that I wasn’t being considered.”A host of brands now make exercise clothes constructed with different bodies in mind. Okafor citesGrrrl as one(tagline: “We make real clothes for real women who simply don’t care”). Forbes-Bell says the brandCurvy Katehas created “sports bras for larger-chested women at more affordable prices”, something that has been a battle for her since she was a teenager. And Gymshark is “creating a lot of more inclusive clothing: size-inclusive, more modest wear as well. For gym clothing, that was very scarce before.”View image in fullscreenClients in their 20s and early 30s ‘tend to embrace the trend of matching activewear sets’ … Lauren Crowder, managing director of ELEVEN:ELEVEN Studios in Liverpool.Photograph: HandoutWith all the new and improved tight gym gear out there, if younger women in their 20s are still opting for baggier styles, could it be for other reasons? Okafor sees “all manners of bodies and ages” at her pole studio and thinks that, in general, younger generations are “giving themselves more space”. Sheppard sees this as a response to our times. Young people “are living in a period of global crises that make the focus on themselves seem too indulgent … It’s like, just put on clothes. We’ve got bigger problems.”Ultimately, if there is more room for divergence from a workout uniform, then it might have benefits for all generations. “How many people would probably want to go to the gym and work out if they could wear clothes that didn’t make them feel embarrassed?” asks Okafor.“It’s about questioning the motivations,” says Forbes-Bell. “And I think that’s empowering, whether it’s baggy or whether it’s tight, that idea of: ‘Why am I actually wearing this? What am I trying to achieve?’”Explore more on these topicsFashionFitnessWomenfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It was a very low moment. My husband was a shut-down, cold man. Part of what finally motivated me to leave was he seemed incapable of caring for me, or even really talking to me after our daughter was born.What first struck me about David was his warmth. He is a father and had also been through a difficult separation, so could understand what I was experiencing. David is very funny and free-spirited. What I love most about him is his spontaneity. His brain is wired in a completely different way to mine. I can be quite rigid, but he encourages me to loosen up. He makes me feel interesting, which I’d never felt in my marriage.I convinced myself that sex didn’t really matter in a relationship and that I could do withoutI was unhappy in my body after having a child – but David really built my confidence up. I’m embarrassed to admit this, but I didn’t even really know much about my own anatomy before I met him. I’d had orgasms with previous partners, but I’d never tried to give myself one – I’d always felt too ashamed. In my previous relationships, after the initial excitement had worn off, I would stop being able to climax, but felt too shy to ever tell any of my partners. I convinced myself that sex didn’t really matter in a relationship – and that I could do without it.When David found out I’d never used a sex toy, he gently encouraged me to buy a few. Now we have quite a collection, and use them together. We live with my young child and his two teenagers in a small flat, so sex can be tricky, logistically. But David has come up with some inventive solutions. We live in the countryside, so sometimes we drive the car down the lane to a wooded area and have sex on the back seats. Sometimes we even have sex on the ground in the actual wood. There’s more space that way.David is so comfortable in his own skin and that makes sex fun and joyful. If you had told me three years ago I would feel this free, I would never have believed you.David, 38Anook had never used a vibrator before we met and now we have an enormous box of toys that we hide under our bedI remember the first time I saw Anook, in the car park at work. I was stopped dead in my tracks by the look on her face. She was beautiful, of course, but she looked so lost. I had just gone through a terrible divorce, so I recognised something of what I was feeling in her expression. We started talking and I invited her for a coffee. I immediately felt close to her.The sex has always been very loving between us, but when we first got together, Anook was really lacking in confidence. I think she felt sex was dirty or wrong. I would tell her how stunning she is and she wouldn’t believe me. So I’d spend a lot of time reassuring her that sex isn’t bad, it’s fun and she should enjoy it.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

I don’t claim to be any kind of Adonis, but I can do a pretty good job with my wordsSometimes when we’re hanging out with friends, and sex comes up in conversation, I see Anook’s eyes completely light up and I think about how much she has changed. She used to be so shy that she’d look at the floor at any mention of the subject. She’s helped my confidence a lot, too. I was broken when I met her, but now I’m loud and boisterous. She has built me up so much.We’ve actually transferred some of our toys to the back of my car, so we can drive out to the woods and have a bit of time away from the children now and then.

Day-to-day departmental spending, known in Treasury parlance as RDEL, bobbled around £300bn a year between 2010 and 2019 before shooting up during the Covid pandemic and subsequent energy crisis to hit £423bn in 2023-4.Last autumn’s budget, let’s not forget, included a stonking £40bn-a-year tax increase and bumped up RDEL to anestimated £481bnfor the current financial year, a significant jump that prompted thinktanks to increase their forecasts for economic growth.Labour warned to keep spending review in line with net zero or face legal actionRead moreThe growth rate of spending at the back end of the parliament will be considerably lower after this early jolt, and the voracious demands of health and defence will force difficult decisions. But austerity this is not. By the end of the parliament,Labourexpects RDEL to be more than £540bn a year.News that schools spending per pupil will reach its highest ever level in real terms is an example of what the government wants to do with the extra resources it is making available.The unfortunate truth for Reeves and her colleagues, though, is that two things can be true at the same time: the uplift in spending she has outlined is significant and will make a real difference, but it is not enough to meet the scale of the challenges the UK faces.While the government is rightly trumpeting a jump in public investment, for example, current plans show departmental capital budgets declining in real terms in the final two years of the parliament. It seems hard to imagine that being plausible, given the crumbling state of many hospitals, prisons and schools. The “moral mission” of tackling child poverty, which Reeves has talked about, may also demand additional resources.The government badly needed a clearer story from the outset about what it wanted to achieve. But it will need it all the more if, as seems increasingly likely, it decides to come back to the country with more tax rises.Voters don’t just want to hear the what (fillingthe “black hole”in the public finances) but also the why.The economist Mariana Mazzucato – whose idea of the “mission economy” Keir Starmer borrowed to create his cross-party, thematic approach to government – last week put her finger on one reason Labour may have struggled to explain its purpose.Speaking at a conference hosted by the IPPR thinktank, she said a primary mistake had been to try to make restoring economic growth a mission in itself.“Growth is not a mission,” she said. “The whole point about missions was to stop just talking about growth, focus on the problems, and design the solutions to those problems in such a way that drives not just the rate of growth but the direction.”She added: “In a country like this one, where the private sector does not invest enough … missions should be designed in such a way to catalyse that missing private-sector investment. And so, starting with the problems, whether it’s net zero, whether it’s health problems for cities, whether it’s problems like knife crime, having really clear goals that you can actually answer yes or no, did we achieve it?’”Mazzucato argued that Labour’s aspiration to become a clean-energy powerhouse was the only one of its five “missions” that might qualify as such by her definition.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Economic growth for its own sake, not so much.Rachel Reeves unveils £15bn for trams, trains and buses outside LondonRead moreAnother reason Reeves now needs to remind the public what she stands for results from a sombre pre-election rebrand aimed at overcoming voters’ preconceptions about having a woman – specifically, a Labour woman – in charge of the country’s purse strings.One Labour pollster recalls a focus group early in Reeves’s tenure as shadow chancellor when she had visited a construction site with Starmer, and one voter wanted to know: “Why has he taken his wife with him?”The sharp suits, serious demeanour and relentless focus on tough choices are a riposte to this kind of regrettable “Rachel from accounts” nonsense, but they have resulted in a reductive idea of what Reeves stands for.Expect to hear more on Wednesday, then, about the scourge of child poverty, as well as the need to tool up to face the changed geopolitical context – and to rebalance the economy away from London and the south-east.Even if she sticks with current spending plans for the rest of the parliament, Reeves may yet have to make more tax increases in the autumn. It looks increasingly likely the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) will decide to downgrade its projections for productivity growth.The consultancy OxfordEconomicssuggests that if the OBR moves into line with the consensus on productivity – and cuts its growth forecasts as a result – it would leave the chancellor having to find an extra £20bn a year.Given that she is determined not to abandonher fiscal rules, that would mean tax increases. Reeves will need to be ready to tell a compelling story about why these are necessary. That should start this week, with a clearer and more hopeful picture of what Labour wants to achieve.Explore more on these topicsRachel ReevesEconomics viewpointLabourEconomic policyTax and spendingEconomicscommentShareReuse this content"

Perhaps we should try sharing our planetSun 8 Jun 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 8 Jun 2025 12.46 EDTShareAt this year’s Cannes film festival, some unexpected hires joined the security detail at luxury hotel the Majestic. They were clad not in kevlar but in deep chestnut plumage, with wingspans up to four feet, talons for toes and meat-ripping ebony beaks. The new recruits were Harris hawks and their mission was clear: guard stars from the aerial menace of gulls daring to photobomb or snatch vol-au-vents.This might sound like an extreme solution to a benign problem – after all, haven’t most of us lost sandwiches to swooping beaks and come out relatively unscathed? But as these notorious food pirates come ashore in growing numbers, cities around the world are increasingly grappling with how to manage them. Hiring hawks from local falconer Christophe Puzin was the Majestic’s answer to curbing gull-related incidents (such as Sophie Marceau’s 2011 wine-on-dress situation). But in metropolises such as New York, Rome, Amsterdam and London gulls are widely considered a menace, too, as they take up permanent residence on urban stoops.Gulls seem to be louder than ever, which makes it easy to forget their status as seabirds in crisis. All of the more than50 global species of gullare falling victim to fragmenting habitats under conflicting marine policy measures, devastating avian flu, and evenbrain damageand organ failure resulting from plastic ingestion. In the UK, this torrent of trouble has renderedmany species of gull in decline.Predator-free rooftops have enticed them from the waves since the 1940s and, broadly speaking, gulls have adapted well to their changing environment – even becoming effective urbanseed dispersers. Lamp-posts have replaced cliff ledges, buildings are islands, landfill is rocky shore. One study found thatgulls can recognise human routines, with their presence around schools tripling during mealtimes. Their adaptation – however bothersome it might be for us – has driven their survival. Perhaps acknowledging this could help us to live alongside them.As we have no licence to either capture or kill these birds, introducing hawks as agents of natural gull control is one method of regulating human/gull interaction. Some councils have produced gull awareness campaigns, encouraging locals to report nesting and not to feed them. Others default to installing physical barriers, such as spokes and spikes, to discourage gulls’ resting sites. Such measures are expensive for local authorities and their effectiveness is inconclusive. Some councils, such as Carlisle, opt for a more covert approach, threatening gulls more gently in the form ofhawk-like kites. In Exeter, Deliveroo trialled “repellent” audio tracks, broadcasting recorded falcon cries and gull distress calls to deter them. Researchers at the University of Exeter have also investigated thebenefit of holding eye contactwith a gull, in making them think twice about stealing food.But such an array of anti-gull options perpetuates the patronising narrative of these animals as pests. The fact that gulls are thriving in cities points to our own ecological failures as a society. Global household waste is growing rapidly, most of which is thrown into landfill, where it is left to rot, releasing large amounts ofmethane– a greenhouse gas80 timesmore harmful than carbon dioxide for 20 years after its release. We aren’t so much giving gulls an ocean eviction notice as we are begging for them to come inland, feeding their instinct to dive, rip and smash around us – one bin day at a time.View image in fullscreenA gull weighs up its lunch options in St Ives, Cornwall.Photograph: Matt Cardy/Getty ImagesSo what are urban gulls, if not a menace? Perhaps, in Cannes, they’re a message of timing. The film festival takes place in May, duringgull breeding season(April to July). It is a period when gulls are loud and chaotic, their defensiveness spiking when hatching and fledging; andwhen food is visible, we’re baiting them with easy pickings. With broods to protect, reflexes are heightened.It is easy to conflate gulls’ seasonal survival with year-round behaviour. On wilder shores, these periods of increased activity would unfold unnoticed. But we have altered ecological niches to make cities too tempting, deforming the instincts of species trying to adapt with acts of imagination and resilience.As a long-living social species that has mastered feats of adaptation, gulls have much to teach us. And as they adapt to urban habitats, we must also learn to live alongside them. This offers us a chance to change the story, to shape the future of shared urban spaces. Spaces where festival organisers align with nature’s calendar, and the rhythms of life are respected. Spaces where waste is not just managed, but reimagined. Spaces where human impact is studied with intent, not ignorance. Spaces that would allow our relationship with the wild to mature so profoundly, conflict would become obsolete.Sophie Pavelle is a writer and science communicatorExplore more on these topicsBirdsOpinionAnimal behaviourAnimalsWildlifecommentShareReuse this content"

Don’t believe the PR hype: these weapons are immoral, irrational and catastrophicSun 8 Jun 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 8 Jun 2025 06.19 EDTSharePlans by Keir Starmer’s government to modernise and potentially expand Britain’s nuclear weapons arsenal, unveiled in the 2025strategic defence review (SDR), seriously undermine international non-proliferation efforts. They will fuel a global nuclear arms race led by the US, China and Russia. And they increase the chances that lower-yield, so-called tactical nukes will be deployed and detonated in conflict zones.This dangerous path leads in one direction only: towards thenormalisation of nuclear warfare.These unconscionable proposals are a far cry from the days when Robin Cook, Labour’s foreign secretary from 1997 to 2001,championed unilateral nuclear disarmamentand helped scrap the UK’s airdropped gravity bombs. They are a continuation of a redundant, inhuman, immoral, potentially international law-breaking deterrence policy thatcash-strapped Britain can ill afford, will struggle to implement at cost and on time, and which perpetuates illusions about its global power status.Starmer’s justification for spending an additional £15bn on nuclear warheads for four as yet un-built Dreadnought-class submarines, whose price tag is £41bn and rising, is that the world – and the threat – has changed. But in terms of nuclear arms, it really hasn’t. Even as cold war tensions receded, the eight other known nuclear-weapons states – the US, Russia, China, France, India, Pakistan, North Korea and Israel – clung on to their arsenals. Some expanded them.Today, as the global security environment deteriorates again, governments that ignored an obligation to pursue nuclear disarmament “in good faith” under article six of the 1970non-proliferation treaty(NPT) are finding new reasons to keep on doing so. Britain must not compound its decades-long failure to honour the spirit of the treaty. The SDR’s assertion that“continued UK leadership within the NPT is imperative”seems disingenuous, given government intentions.The SDR concedes the NPT, up for review next year, is close to failing. “Historical structures for maintaining strategic stability and reducing nuclear risks have not kept pace with the evolving security picture,” it says. “With New Start [the 2010 US-Russia strategic arms reduction treaty] set to expire in February 2026, thefuture of strategic arms control– at least in the medium term – does not look promising.”This is a Trident missile-sized understatement. Nuclear proliferation is once again a huge problem. The US will spend an estimated $2tn over 30 years on weapons development.Donald Trump said in Februaryhe wants to “denuclearise”. Guess what! He’s doing the opposite. The White House is seeking toraise the National Nuclear Security Administration’s annual weapons budgetby 29%, to $25bn, while slashing funding for the arts, sciences and foreign aid. That’s on top of several multibillion-dollar Pentagon weapons programmes.China’s nuclear strike force hasmore than doubled in size since 2020, with some pointed at Taiwan. Russia’s expanding capabilities include anuclear-capable hypersonic missile, recentlyfired into Ukraine. And Trump’sGolden Dome planupends prior undertakings on anti-missile defence. By joining the proliferators, hypocritical Britain sends acynical signal to Iran, Saudi Arabia and others whose supposed nuclear ambitions it opposes.One future scenario is especially chilling: the possible reintroduction by Britain of air-launched nuclear weapons for the first time since Cook scrapped them. This could involve buying US F-35A fighters and arming them withUS-designed B61-12 bombs. These bombs have variable yields and could be used tactically, against a battlefield target, a command HQ or a city. They could be launched remotely, using unmanned drones. They bring the prospect of nuclear warfare measurably closer.Starmer is leaning heavily on the review’s claim that Russian “nuclear coercion” is the biggest menace facing the UK. Even if true, no amount of nuclear missiles and bombs may suffice if political will is lacking to directly confront Vladimir Putin by, for example, deploying Nato conventional forces to defend Ukraine and responding forcefully to hybrid attacks on Britain. Like the former US president Joe Biden, Starmer gives too much credence toMoscow’s crude threats. Putin knows that if he presses the nuclear button, it will explode in his face. He’s many things – but not suicidal.This is the conundrum at the heart of nuclear deterrence theory. Nuking a nuclear-armed adversary guarantees self-destruction (which is whyIndia and Pakistan jibbed at all-out warlast month). And hurling nuclear threats at states and foes that lack nuclear weapons is ineffective. As Ukraine shows, they grow more defiant. As a weapon, nuclear blackmail is overrated. Fear of British nukes did not deter Argentina’s 1982 Falklands invasion. Nukes did not stop al-Qaida in 2001 or Hamas in 2023. So why have nukes at all?Retaining nuclear weapons at current or increased levelsdoes not make Britain safer. Their use would be immoral, irrational and catastrophic. They are grossly expensive, consuming resources that the UK, facing painful Treasury cuts again this week, could more sensibly use to build hospitals and schools and properly equip its armed forces.It’suncertain how independentof the US the British deterrent really is in practice. Does Starmer or Trump have the final word on use?Official secrecy prevents adequate democratic scrutiny. And the idea that nuclear warfare, once the taboo is broken, might somehow be contained or limited is a fast-track ticket to oblivion. Gradual disarmament, not rearmament, is the only way to escape this nightmare.The SDR urges a government PR campaign to convince the British people of the “necessity” of a nuclear arsenal. No thanks. As Russia againraises nuclear war fears, what’s needed is public education about the dangers of weapons proliferation. People worry about everything from an existential global climate emergency to the cost of living. But what we’re discussing here is the universal cost of dying.Nuclear warfare is the most immediate threat to life on earth. Worry about that first. It’s a shortcut to apocalypse – now.Simon Tisdall is a Guardian foreign affairs commentatorExplore more on these topicsNuclear weaponsOpinionDefence policyTridentMilitarycommentShareReuse this content"

She was the funny one, the party starter, the friend who never said no to another round of drinks. To friends and colleagues, she seemed effortlessly confident.But beneath the banter and bravado was a deep discomfort – with silence, with vulnerability, and most of all, with herself.“I didn’t even realise I was numbing anything,” she told me in one of our recent therapy sessions. “I just thought I liked to have fun. But looking back, I was terrified of feeling anything real.”Jamie, now 39, is part of a growing number of Australians rethinking their relationship with alcohol. For her, drinking wasn’t just a habit, it was a coping mechanism – although she was the last one to realise this. She was drinking to blur the edges.Narcissism can’t always be fixed – but you can heal after being hurt by it | Bianca DennyRead moreThere wasn’t a traumatic event that she could remember, but because feeling sad or lonely or anxious felt unbearable, alcohol helped her skip past that. It worked – until it didn’t.Her “bottom” wasn’t dramatic; she told me in one session it was more like a slow hollowing, and she got tired of waking up feeling like a stranger to herself.The turning point came in the early months of the pandemic. Isolated from friends, stripped of distractions, she began to realise how often she reached for wine to fill the space. “One night I was sitting alone with a glass of pinot, and I remember thinking – what would happen if I didn’t drink this?”That question changed everything.Jamie decided to stop drinking “just for a month”. But when the fog began to lift, she couldn’t go back. She describes early sobriety as raw and revealing. She was suddenly face to face with everything she pushed away for years – grief, anxiety, even joy – and it became overwhelming.Alcohol addiction and emotional numbingAlcohol addiction is often less about the substance itself and more about what it helps a person avoid.From a clinical standpoint, we understand alcohol not just as a chemical dependency, but as an emotional anaesthetic – one that temporarily blunts the nervous system’s distress signals. Many individuals who struggle with problematic drinking patterns may have started out chasing pleasure and to be social; but consistent reliance upon alcohol can result in using it to flee pain such as unprocessed grief, chronic stress, shame, anxiety or trauma.Claire felt overwhelmed by life’s uncertainties. A self-imposed pause helped her find solid ground | Sara MussaRead moreThe neurobiology of addiction reveals that alcohol activates the brain’s reward system while simultaneously suppressing the prefrontal cortex, impairing emotional regulation and decision-making. In this way, alcohol becomes a fast, accessible tool for short-term relief – even if it compounds emotional dysregulation in the long term.What makes this cycle so complex is that emotional numbing isn’t always conscious. Clients often present in therapy describing “overwhelm”, “flatness” or “disconnection”, without immediately recognising that these are signs of emotional avoidance – and that alcohol has become part of that equation. Therapy helps illuminate the underlying patterns: how early attachment dynamics, adverse childhood experiences or unresolved trauma may have shaped a person’s tolerance for emotional discomfort.A trauma-informed approach encourages clients to build somatic awareness, develop emotional literacy and begin tolerating – rather than bypassing – their internal experience. Recovery, then, is not only about abstaining from alcohol; it’s about being able to stay present with what’s real and building a nervous system that can feel without needing to flee.How to overcome emotional numbingIn group therapy with professional guidance, Jamie started to see how she had numbed her emotions and buried the difficulties she had experienced in her life. “I sat with just me,” she recalled. “And I started crying and couldn’t stop. It felt like every emotion I’d stored was finally being released.”I encouraged Jamie to begin journalling daily and start each entry with the question: “What am I feeling today?” Sometimes she said it was anger. Sometimes relief. Sometimes nothing at all. Jamie finally allowed herself to feel – not with fear, but with curiosity. Our emotions can serve as signposts, gently pointing us towards the places where healing is needed: our blockages, our numbness and the parts of us that have gone quiet in the face of hopelessness.Trauma can leave us emotionally numb – each step towards reconnection is a win | Diane YoungRead moreRecovery – from drinking, from disconnection, from self-avoidance – isn’t linear, and Jamie is still in that process. But what’s changed is her willingness to stay with herself, especially when things feel hard.Jamie is one of many emerging in what some call the “sober curious” movement. But for her, it’s not about labels or lifestyle – it’s about presence. She’s not interested in moralising alcohol use. It’s not about judging drinking. It’s about asking why.Whyam I drinking?Whatam I avoiding? Can I support myself with awareness? And what might be possible if I stopped?In a culture where numbing is easy – scroll, sip, swipe – choosing to feel can feel too hard. It’s important to take at least one quiet moment a day to ask yourself:What am I feeling?You might be surprised by the answer.* All clients discussed are fictional amalgamsDiane Young is a trauma specialist and psychotherapist atSouth Pacific Private, a trauma, addiction and mental health treatment centreIn Australia, support is available atBeyond Blueon 1300 22 4636,Lifelineon 13 11 14, and atMensLineon 1300 789 978.

Let’s see how they feel when they’ve dragged a screaming child out of an excrement-fouled ball pitSun 8 Jun 2025 09.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 8 Jun 2025 14.41 EDTShareIabsolutely cannot fathom the number of populist rightwing politicians and commentators who have looked at the smouldering mess that is the world currently and thought: “I know what this situation demands –more toddlers.”Population-boosting discourse and policieshave spread acrossEurope(Hungary, Poland, Greece, Italy and beyond), while in the US an unholy coalition of tech bros, religious conservatives, blowhard podcasters and the politicians who pander to them have gone loudly pronatalist. JD Vance used his first speech as vice-president to proclaim: “I want more babies in the United States of America”; Elon Musk called declining birthrates “a much bigger risk to civilisation than global warming”; and Trump is considering various procreation-incentivising policies, includinga $5,000 “baby bonus”, which I believe is what a carton of eggs – hen, not human – costs in the US these days.Now Nigel Farage has hopped on the breeding bandwagon (tick that off your “What fresh hell?” bingo card). Reform, he says, wants to go “much further to encourage people to have children”.The rise of pronatalism: why Musk, Vance and the right want women to have more babiesRead moreI needed to do something other than grind my teeth to stumps about this, so I’ve been brainstorming an entrance test for the role of publicly boring on about birth rates. Because having numerous children yourself (Vance lets the side down with a mere three; Musk tops the leaderboard with 14) doesn’t qualify you to harangue others to do the same; you need to have actually walked the multiple-children walk – done the stuff parents without a flotilla of staff or a tradwife spouse have to do.Here are a few suggested “canon” events politicians should experience before they’re allowed to pontificate about our patriotic duty to breed.Post-partum multi-child wranglingYour internal organs either feel like, or actually are, falling out; you can’t sit down or lift anything safely (not sure how we simulate this for the bros, but it’s 2025 – technology can surely assist). Unfortunately, the writhing newborn with its gums clamped to your nipple hasn’t got the memo, and who’s this erupting into the room, exuding the on-the-brink energy of someone whose world recently imploded? It’s 12kg of inexplicably naked toddler barrelling towards a plug socket while intimating an urgent need to urinate, an open bottle of Calpol (where did they get that?) casually slung in one hand. Your move – oh, hang on, you can’t move.A month of bedtimesJust regular, awful bedtimes: different, elaborate, multi-phase sleep rituals more complex than a Korean skincare regime for each child. A colicky baby. A toddler who fights sleep with the raw power of a heavyweight boxer. A child who waits until 11pm when you’re on your very last nerve to ask the big questions about death. Standard stuff.Soft playYou’re hungover, sick or sleep-deprived (joke – you’re always sleep-deprived) and desperate to crawl into a dark hole, but no, it’s 9am, everyone’s been up for four hours and you’re in an echoing hangar with lighting, music and general ambience inspired by Guantánamo, having paid £10 per person for the privilege.Sex in the soft play area: the debauched, disgusting secrets of the ball pitsRead moreOne kid is attached to your leg, refusing to have fun without you; one has vanished entirely; another is headed straight into the ball pit, where they promptly have a screaming nervous breakdown. You’ll need to retrieve them, knowing there’s at least one rogue poo in there somewhere (worst lucky dip ever).Multi-child school shoe-shoppingHow bad can it be, you say to yourself? Then the sweating and the flashbacks start. It’s worse than ’Nam in Clarks and there’s no way out but through.A budget self-catering breakThe cottage has vertiginously slippery stairs and surfaces full of low-hanging fragile knick-knacks, plus inadequate curtains, so everyone wakes at 4am. With no Freeview or phone reception, you can’t outsource the early shift to Bluey. The intersection of allergy, intolerance and awkwardness is such that there is no food everyone will eat. It’s day one and you’re already praying for the sweet release of death.Simultaneous family norovirusGuts in violent turmoil, you’re physically unable to move more than a metre from your lavatory while being repeatedly called upon to clean up – probably even catch in your cupped hands! – your sick children’s effluvia.

Here’s the counterstrategySun 8 Jun 2025 07.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 8 Jun 2025 19.29 EDTShareDuring the first 100-plus days of his presidency,Donald Trumphas done his damnedest to remake the US in his image. Fearing Hurricane Donald, a host of universities, law firms, newspapers, public schools and Fortune 500 companies have rushed to do his bidding, bowing before he even comes calling. Other institutions cower, in hopes that they will go unnoticed.But this behavior, which social scientists call “anticipatory compliance”, smoothes the way to autocracy because it gives the Trump regime unlimited power without his having to lift a finger. Halting autocracy in its tracks demands a counter-strategy – let’s call it anticipatorynoncompliance.Examples of anticipatory compliance are legion.How to fight back against Trump? Look to poor people’s movements | Rev Dr Liz Theoharis and Noam Sandweiss-BackRead moreGoodbye, academic freedom:Trump means to impose his anti-intellectual ideology on higher education. He is using unproven allegations of antisemitism and claims of discriminatory diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programs as an excuse to punish top-ranked private universities – initially hapless Columbia, then other schools including Harvard, Princeton, Cornell and Northwestern – by withholding billions of dollars in federal grants. My own university, the University of California, Berkeley, anticipates that it will be added to this list when Trump turns his attention to nationally renowned public universities.“Be afraid” is the message for every university – threats to withhold funds from schools that use “woke” language have prompted some that aren’t even under the gun to censor themselves,excising wordslike “race”, “gender”, “class” and “equity” from course titles and curriculums.Anticipatory compliance also affects the actions of public schools. Worried that, because of their alleged “wokeness”, they will lose the federal dollars that deliver extra help to those who need it most, school systems have altered their curriculum to whitewash the historical record and restrict the literature available to students. Adieu, Toni Morrison and Rosa Parks.Goodbye, free press:Disney and Metashelled outacombined $40mto settle baseless libel lawsuits brought by Trump, and Paramount is negotiating to make Trump’s spurious 60 Minutes lawsuit disappear.On the eve of the 2024 election, Jeff Bezos, Amazon’s founder and the owner of the Washington Post, pulled an editorial endorsing Kamala Harris, to stay in Trump’s good graces. So did the Los Angeles Times, whose owner is a billionaire businessman.Goodbye, legal representation:Nine leading law firmssuccumbed to blackmail to get rid of the president’s executive orders that punished a few firms for displeasing him. Collectively, they agreed to provide more than $1bn worth of pro bono legal work to causes of Trump’s choosing. Now they’re being asked to defend the coal industry and tariffs, which surely isn’t what they expected.To curry favor and avoid ridicule in a Trump tweet, dozens of major companies are treating the president as if he were kingWhat’s more, some top-drawer firms have stopped providing pro bono work on immigration lawsuits and other hot topic issues. Instead, they are putting their talent at Trump’s disposal, neutering themselves while the White House makes mincemeat of the rule of law.Hello, toadying:To curry favor and avoid ridicule in a Trump tweet, dozens of major companies, ranging fromAmazon to Pepsi, are treating the president as if he were king, reducing or abandoning their DEI programs without being specifically threatened.Those who bend the knee rationalize their actions as simply a prudent survival strategy. But that’s delusory, for the historical record shows that anticipatory compliance paves the road to autocracy. Bullies like Trump always demand more from their supplicants – more money, more abandoning principles, more loyalty-oath behavior. Anticipatory compliance feeds the beast, showing authoritarians how much they can get away with.Here’s the good news – anticipatory noncompliance is on the rise. Challenges to Trump’s unconstitutional actions have emerged in higher and K-12 education, the legal profession and the corporate world. The citizenry is now making its voice heard.Spearheaded by Harvard’s defiant pose, a growing number of colleges and universities are pushing back against Trump’s outrageous demands.A recent statementfrom hundreds of college administrators declared that “we speak with one voice against the unprecedented government overreach and political interference now endangering American higher education”. Faculty senates in the Big 10 Academic Alliance crafted a “mutual defense compact”; behind the scenes, the presidents of about10 elite private universitiesare deciding what red lines they won’t cross.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFighting BackFree newsletterBig thinkers on what we can do to protect civil liberties and fundamental freedoms in a Trump presidency.

Diversity is a popular goal that many investors and consumers take into account in their decisions. When Target rolled back DEI, the company had to confront a consumer boycott and a 17% stock drop. Meanwhile, corporations like Costco and Apple, which have stood firm, are on buyers’ and investors’ good guy list.Several law firms refused to cavein the face of Trump’s blackmail tactics, insteadtaking the administration to court. Not only is that the right thing to do; it could turn out to be the profitable course. The judges areunequivocally on their side. And when Microsoft dropped a firm that surrendered to Trump,signing onwith a firm that’s taking the administration to court, it signaled that virtue may be financially rewarded.After months of quiescence, with the populace overwhelmed by the tsunami of outrages, popular opposition is emerging. On May Day,tens of thousandsof demonstrators participated in nearly1,000 anti-Trump demonstrations.Restoring democracy is no easy task, for it is infinitely easier to destroy than rebuild. It will take a years-long fight that deploys an arsenal of tactics, ranging from mass demonstrations and consumer boycotts to litigation and political organizing. It’s grueling work, but if autocracy is to be defeated there’s no option. “Not everything that is faced can be changed; but nothing can be changed until it is faced,” observed James Baldwin, in a 1962 New York Times article. A half-century later, that message still rings true.What’s giving me hope nowCourts have stood firm in their defense of the rule of law, pushing back against Trump’s power-grab executive orders. Americans are participating in mass demonstrations nationwide and voting for Democratic candidates in local elections. What’s more, Americans are voting with their wallets – spurred by a consumer boycott, the value of Tesla shares has plunged by close to $700bn from its peak a year ago.David Kirp is professor emeritus at the Goldman School of Public Policy, University of California, BerkeleyExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpFighting BackTrump administrationLaw (US)US universitiesHigher educationUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

No doubt Rachel Reeves, who has a picture of Wilkinson on thewall of her office, is aware of this – and also that the Treasury subsequently decided the policy was unaffordable. The meals were subsidised instead.Despite these initial charges, and later price rises, poorer children did gain, and keep, an entitlement to free school meals. The announcement last week that this is being extended in England to all those whose parents or carers claim universal credit – rather than restricted to families with incomes lower than £7,400 – should be welcomed by allobjectors to child poverty. Being assured of a hot lunch in the middle of the school day makes pupils’ lives better. Children cannot be expected to learn when they do not have enough to eat. This might sound obvious, but is easily forgotten. Scotland and Northern Ireland already have more generous rules in place.Ministers clearly hope that this will be a popular policy, as they prepare forthis week’s spending reviewand the reaction to it.Hunger in schoolsis disturbingly widespread and the enthusiastic reception to Marcus Rashford’s campaign on school food showed that this is a cause the public warms to. Long before last year’s election, breakfast clubs were a flagship Labour policy. Now they are part of Bridget Phillipson’s schools bill.But as with breakfast clubs, which some schools have said that theycannot deliveron the budget provided, good intentions must not mask inadequate finances. Already, the Institute for Fiscal Studies haschallenged the government’s claimthat 100,000 children will be lifted out of poverty. It said this can only be expected over the long term. And some children already entitled to free meals do not receive them – promptingcalls for auto-enrolment.Another challenge concerns food quality, which has been eroded by a series of below-inflation funding increases. Free lunches are already offered to all pupils up to the age of seven. But a recently announced3p risein the subsidy towards these (from £2.58 to £2.61 per meal), was rightly criticised for forcing school leaders to either reduce their lunch offer, or make cuts elsewhere. The average actual cost of a school lunch is £3.16.Twenty years after the Channel 4 television seriesJamie’s School Dinnersturned kitchens’ reliance on junk food into a national issue, it is depressing that resources remain so meagre. Childhood obesity andpoor dental healthare serious problems, particularly in poorer parts of the country where treatment is harder to access. Ms Phillipson and her colleagues should be more ambitious about quality as well as quantity. Improvements could contribute to children’s overall wellbeing, as well as nutrition. Meals are social events, not just refuelling stops.But step back from the table and the bigger picture comes into view. Child poverty, of which poor diets are a symptom, cannot be tackled by schools alone. Reducing it means raising family incomes through the benefits system – as well as trying to boostwage growth. Earlier this year, someLabour MPs warnedthat school food risked becoming a sop. That danger has not gone away. The latest announcement on free lunches is good news so long as it does not distract from efforts to remove the two-child benefit cap, or weaken the wider campaign against child poverty.Explore more on these topicsSchool mealsOpinionSchoolsChildrenPovertyRachel ReevesBenefitsMarcus RashfordeditorialsShareReuse this content"

In its extraordinary candour about sex – a hallmark of White’s prodigious career – the novel remains startling today. It arrived at a pivotal moment in gay history: after the hope of the Stonewall uprising and just before the devastation of Aids, both of which White documented in what became an autobiographical trilogy withThe Beautiful Room is Empty(1988) andThe Farewell Symphony(1998).Lancashire in the 1970s might seem a world away from the American midwest two decades earlier, but Jeanette Winterson’s account of her miserable childhood inOranges Are Not the Only Fruitwas similarly groundbreaking when it was first published in 1985. Forty years later, plans are under way for an RSCmusicalversion next year. “Why be happy when you could be normal?” her adoptive mother, Mrs Winterson, an evangelical Pentecostal Christian, demands, when she catches the teenage Jeanette in bed with another girl.It doesn’t get much more mainstream than a musical. But, as Wintersontoldthe audience at the Hay literary festival last weekend, the BBC’s Bafta-winning 1990 adaptation was a “very brave” move after Section 28. “It really shook up TV at that moment,” she said.Now another BBC adaptation is shaking up TV.What It Feels Like for a Girl(the title is a 2000 Madonna song), based on Paris Lees’ 2021memoir, powerfully shows what it meant to be a transgender teenager in the Midlands in the noughties. This personal story has once again landed at a time of intense public reckoning over LGBTQ+ rights.What It Feels Like for a Girl might be recent history, but, with ominous nods to a nascent internet, it is still a period piece. It is pre-social media and what Jonathan Haidt, in his bookThe Anxious Generation, has called “the great rewiring of childhood”. Where once young people read to discover they were not alone, now theyscroll.Each of these coming-out stories is rooted in a specific time and place. They are about class as well as sex, the salvation of books and music as well as romance. They are about loneliness, desire and a longing for escape – being a teenager, in short. Despite heartbreaking scenes of abuse and pain, they are also bursting with excitement. One of the conditions of youth is that one’s “own story” feels like the only story. This is why the coming-of-age narrative endures.In our digital age of toxic masculinity and intolerance, these memoirs call for truthfulness and compassion. They are reminders of the fragility of progress. “If gays have gone from invisibility to ubiquity and from self-hatred to self-acceptance,” White wrote in his last book,The Loves of My Life, published in January, “we should recognize we’re still being pushed off cliffs in Yemen – and from the top fronds of Florida palms, for all I know.”Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

I have never doubted myself. Even though in those match points down, I thought just one point at a time. Just one point and then after one point and then try to save that game and keep believing. That’s what I thought.”Alcaraz produced one of the greatest comebacks as he recovered from the brink of defeat to oust Sinner, the world No 1, 4-6, 6-7 (4), 6-4, 7-6 (3), 7-6 (10-2) and win his fifth grand slam title in the longestFrench Openfinal in the open era.Alcaraz, the second seed and defending champion, had trailed 3-5, 0-40 on his serve in the fourth set but he reeled off five points before forcing a fifth set. He has now won five grand slam titles at 22 years old.“Today there were few moments of the match that, I mean, the level was insane,” said Alcaraz.“Being Jannik on the other side of the net playing at such a great level, sometimes I thought: ‘What can I do? What can I do?’ He was moving unbelievable.“He was hitting amazing shots. There were a few moments of the match that he couldn’t miss any ball.

He scored the goal that put Portugal level in this final but had been withdrawn, exhausted, late in normal time and now, as the men left on the field lined up on the halfway line, he stood on the touchline where he could not watch but could hear the roar as Rúben Neves scored the penalty that took Portugal to the title, and then he slipped to his knees and the tears came. It had taken a shootout but they have their secondNations League, defeating Spain in Munich.Goals from Martín Zubimendi, Nuno Mendes and then Mikel Oyarzabal had given Spain a 2-1 lead before Ronaldo made it 2-2 on the hour. Now, an hour after that, it all came down to two shots: Álvaro Morata missed Spain’s fourth spot kick and Neves scored Portugal’s fifth to win 5-3 on penalties, allowing Ronaldo to collect the 34th trophy of his career, aged 40. There was a smile, a joke about its weight and then he carried it to his teammates and lifted it into the sky.Portugal beat Spain on penalties to win Nations League final – as it happenedRead moreIt had been a long night, and if this was a battle of the generations between him and Lamine Yamal, as it had been billed, the elder man won it. In truth, though, while the focus was on the Portugal captain and the Spanish teenager, 23 years his junior, cameras following them even when both had been withdrawn and were sitting on the bench, this was about many more players. About Oyarzabal and Zubimendi, Mendes, Rafael Leão and, in the end, Diogo Costa, who dived to his right to save from Morata. Neves then smashed hard and low, turning to see red shirts running towards him.When it all ended, Luis de la Fuente gathered his players.Nations League winners two years ago, European champions last summer, they had been unable to make it three trophies in a row but he was proud. Spain had started well too: in fact, both times Portugal had drawn level, it had been hard to grasp, although it was also true that Spain faded badly and that Roberto Martínez’s side had been closer to avoiding the shootout.It hadn’t been long before Lamine Yamal had been taken down by the kind of tackle that said something about his threat, although with the teenager drawing them in on the right the real danger was on the left. There, a superb long diagonal from Dean Huijsen allowed Nico Williams to control brilliantly, dash into the area and pull back for Pedri to sidefoot just wide. From there too, Williams cut inside and whipped fractionally past the far post.View image in fullscreenDiogo Costa saves Álvaro Morata’s penalty.Photograph: Christian Charisius/APAnd yet it was through the middle thatSpainscored the first when Oyarzabal’s lovely touch sent Zubimendi running through. He found Lamine whose chipped return wasn’t dealt with by Rúben Dias, Neves or Costa and Zubimendi put in the loose ball from close range. Portugal responded fast, Mendes stepping past opponents to hit a hard, clean low shot into the corner. But Spain reasserted themselves and Oyarzabal gave them the lead again on 45, Pedri slipping the pass through for him to turn into the net.This was the 16th goal Oyarzabal has scored for Spain, his third in a final. His fourth if you include the 2020 Olympics. His was the winner against England last summer but he has lost the other three: the 2021 Nations League final to France, to Brazil at Tokyo 2020, and now here. Because thenheappeared, which he tends to do; which he has done so, so many times.Quick GuideFrance triumph in Germany as Mbappé reaches goal landmarkShowKylian Mbappé scored his 50th goal for France to help them claim third place in the Nations League with a 2-0 victory over Germany in Stuttgart.The hosts spurned several chances to take the lead, most notably when Florian Wirtz saw his effort come back off the frame of the goal, before Mbappé struck on the stroke of half-time to put France ahead.Mbappé is now just one goal off Thierry Henry as France's second all-time leading goalscorer, with Olivier Giroud in front on 57. The 26-year-old Real Madrid forward teed up the substitute Michael Olise late on to secure victory for the visitors.Mike Maignan was just as important for France, who lost a nine-goal semi-final thriller to Spain on Thursday, in this third-place playoff as the goalkeeper made important saves throughout.PA SportWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.It can seem that Ronaldo is not there at times, but he always is. When Mendes escaped Lamine Yamal and his cross took a deflection, looping up and dropping behind Marc Cucurella, there he was again to volley in from close range. It was his 134th international goal and off he went, pointing at his chest. Spain could hardly believe it. They were not dominating as they had before, not creating either, yet nor had they felt under threat. Now though, with Fabián Ruiz and Pedri departed, the control slipped away, even if Williams did then send a shot whistling wide.Martínez’s side, meanwhile, were stepping up. The introduction of Leão changed the game. Unai Simón had to save Bruno Fernandes’s free-kick right on 90 minutes and extra time brought a different flow, a different Portugal. They should have had the lead immediately when Mendes, the greatest threat with Leão, set up Nélson Semedo for a startling miss from five yards. And with 20 seconds remaining Diogo Jota headed over, their moment instead waiting for them on the penalty spot.Explore more on these topicsNations LeaguePortugalSpainmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

A total of 196 looked enough to end a sequence of nine consecutive away defeats against England, a run that began with the bio-bubble Test series of 2020.With the hosts requiring 71 off 39 balls, Jos Buttler and Harry Brook gone, the game was heading to the visitors. Then came Tom Banton, a first-ball six and a change of tune, the final summary a four-wicket England win to secure an unassailable 2-0 lead in the T20 international series.Banton is usually a top-order man in this format but he was dominant in the middle alongside Jacob Bethell as the pair put on 43 off just 15. The former pummelled Gudakesh Motie’s left-arm spin while Bethell struck Alzarri Joseph for three monstrous sixes, one finding the roof of the apartments that overlook Bristol’s County Ground.Sciver-Brunt hits late flurry as England race to ODI series sweep of West IndiesRead moreThe left-hander’s failed ramp on 26 mattered little as Banton remained, his own audacity including a reverse‑flick for four off Jason Holder. He finished on 30 off 11, steel to go with the tricks, nine balls to spare. For Brook it is five wins out of five as permanent captain, some joy finally found after England’s miserable tours of India and Pakistan at the start of the year. “Hopefully we’re entertaining a lot of people and hopefully people start watching us more again,” he said.A golden glow over Bristol turned grey just before the start of play, a breeze for Luke Wood to embrace, the left-arm quick bowling in his first England appearance since September 2023. He was celebrating within seconds, the first ball of the match a swinging toe-bruiser that trapped Evin Lewis in front.Wood’s first couple of overs cost four runs, but there was less comfort for England from the other end. Brook opted for two seamers in his lineup, a repeat of the template used in the Durham series opener. It will probably be the way at the T20 World Cup in the subcontinent next year but this was a bold call on a smaller ground: Liam Dawson’s first two overs went for 20, the amount the left-arm spinner conceded across four in his comeback game.Shai Hope is another newly appointed captain trying to state his authority. The No 3 was tough on Brydon Carse, thumping sixes over long‑off as he advanced rapidly to 49, only to be undone by Adil Rashid’s old-world mastery. The tossed-up leg-break drifted into the right‑hander, the sharp turn away followed by a rapid Buttler stumping. Rashid puckered his lips, a quiet acknowledgment of his own brilliance.Strength lies across this entire West Indies lineup, even in the absence of Nicholas Pooran, one of the best in the world but rested for this series after playing at the Indian Premier League (an apt summary of the sport’s power balance). While Sherfane Rutherford perished quickly and Johnson Charles finished on 47 off 39 balls, Rovman Powell tucked into Dawson on his way to 34 off 15.View image in fullscreenRovman Powell hits out during a strong West Indies batting display.Photograph: Gareth Copley/Getty ImagesHolder was even more brutal with a nine-ball 29. Rashid was entrusted with the penultimate over and the all‑rounder began with three consecutive sixes, the final blow caught by the diving Banton but beyond the long-on rope. A single brought some quiet but Romario Shepherd marmalised a couple down the ground to make it a 31-run over. A first-ball six by Roston Chase closed the late show but not enough had come earlier, with Wood impressive in taking two for 25. “We thought they were probably 20-30 runs short on that pitch,” Brook said. “It was a good wicket and with small boundaries we always felt in the game.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The former England captain repeated the straight hits of his 96 two days previous as he put on 63 with Ben Duckett inside seven overs.Buttler should have perished on 43 to Joseph, but Charles misjuggled in the deep. Another misfield from Charles minutes later added to his misery but redemption followed in the next over. Akeal Hosein, who landed in the morning after visa troubles had delayed his arrival, had Buttler caught by Charles at deep third for 47.Brook could not carry much forward, dismissed by Chase for the second game in a row, the equation leaning towards the visitors. But Banton, who ventured out to the middle and immediately swept the off-spinner for six, wasn’t having it.Explore more on these topicsTwenty20England cricket teamWest Indies cricket teamCricketmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Bonus seconds for third place in the final sprint, behind the stage winner, Lorena Wiebes, was enough for the New Zealander to snatch the overall win.‘They named a sandwich after me’: Luke Rowe on life in the peloton, cobbles and Welsh ridersRead more“I was lucky that there were a lot of seconds up for grabs,” Wollaston, riding for FDJ-Suez, said.Wiebes, SD Worx-Protime teammate to the absent defending champion, Lotte Kopecky, rescued her team’s race with a peerless stage win. “We’ve had some bad luck this week with crashes and lost GC hopes because of it,” she said, “but wrapping up the week with a stage win feels great.”Yet it was Wollaston’s day and her turns of speed in the intermediate sprints chiselled relentlessly away at Ferguson’s narrow lead until only a single second separated the pair in the overall standings.After beating Ferguson yet again, in the third sprint, Wollaston asserted herself in the final dash to the line to take the biggest win of her career. “The plan was to get as many seconds as I could, and unfortunately Cat was on my wheel for every single one, so it really came down to the last sprint,” she said. “There was definitely a moment where I thought: ‘I just cannot do this today.’ My teammates really helped me, and pulled me to the front for the final.”View image in fullscreenAlly Wollaston (centre) shows her joy after winning the Tour of Britain.Photograph: Alex Whitehead/SWpix.com/ShutterstockThe Aucklander’s success came at Ferguson’s expense and the teenager from Skipton crossed the finish line in tears as she realised she had lost the overall lead. “I would have loved to have won. I am gutted, but she was the strongest today,” Ferguson, of the Movistar team, said.“If you had told me at the beginning of the week that I’d be second, I would have been over the moon, so I can’t be too disappointed.”Victory began to slip from Ferguson’s grasp in the series of intermediate sprints centred on Glasgow Green, in which she and her team were consistently overpowered by Wollaston’s FDJ-Suez team.A mid-race puncture also forced an unwelcome bike change and left Ferguson chasing the peloton on the fast circuit. “It was eventful for sure,” Ferguson, who also won the points and best young rider classifications, said. “There was always something going on during the intermediate sprints. I had a puncture, but I didn’t want to change the bike, because I felt OK, [but] then it was slowly going down.”Try as she might, the teenager was unable to prevent Wollaston’s track racing experience from eroding the hard-fought gains made in Saturday’s stage, through the rainswept hills west of Kelso.In the crucial final sprint, Wollaston’s team put her in a better position on the last bend. “I got a bit chopped up on some corners and really that was it,” Ferguson said. “Ally went away and I knew that was it.”Ferguson, winner of the junior world road race and time trial titles last season, can take heart from a consistently strong performance throughout the four-day race. The race’s most dramatic moments came in the hills around Kelso in Saturday’s attritional andrainy 143.8kmthird stage.

The manager did not hold back after the lacklustre performance inthe 1-0 qualifying win against Andorra in Barcelonaon Saturday, questioning their attitude and body language.The result followed winsagainst AlbaniaandLatviaat Wembley in March during Tuchel’s first camp and means England have maximum points in Group K. They have also kept three clean sheets.England were dismal against minnows Andorra but it really doesn’t matter | Jonathan WilsonRead moreTuchel, however, was not shy about highlighting what he did not like against Andorra, which included how the players came to do their own things after they could not blow the tie open, a freestyle approach that led to an overall aimlessness.The travellingEnglandfans also booed the team off at half-time and full time and they will want to see a significant improvement in the friendly against Senegal in Nottingham on Tuesday night.Tuchel said: “What risk [in calling the players out]? What should I say? That we played a good match and are happy. The risk is only that you exaggerate it and make something of it that was not there. Everything I said I said already to the team. There is no harm done. We were not happy and no single player will be happy with what we showed. Why would the coach be? And why would we be shy of saying so? If we want to get better, we first need to address that we were not happy with the end of both halves.“I didn’t name a single name. We do this as a team. It’s always a ‘we’ and I didn’t like how we ended the match and the way we ended the first half. I didn’t like the attitude or the energy level and how that dropped. I liked the beginning [of the game]. It always includes me.“This is a top group. I love the players. I love their character. They know that they underperformed. There is not a big thing in it. We know we underperformed and we are open about it and they are eager to do it better. We will now show them exactly what we want from them and how to it better in the video session tomorrow and the day after.”Tuchel was asked what he had done wrong. “I don’t know … we still won a World Cup qualifier. I am the first one to ask if we could do better. I felt us well prepared and I felt us good in the first 25 minutes.

I thought it was a very strong lineup.”Tuchel was frustrated at the lack of dynamic running off the ball; how his players repeatedly settled for passes into feet. As for the body language, he has made great play of the need for positive interactions between teammates, good communication and even things like high fives. That did not happen. Tuchel made the point that Kane was “one of the very few who stepped up and put a shift in at the end when things got a bit stuck and uncomfortable”.The German is not about to worry, even if there is the prospect of his honeymoon period in the job coming to an end. “I always feel pressure as I am not happy with myself,” he said. “The biggest pressure comes from myself. We have three wins and three clean sheets and we have a friendly match on Tuesday. I have felt more pressure than that. Are England managers judged differently? Fair enough.

I know I’ve been managing my back for the last few weeks now. It’s something that comes and goes.“It can be frustrating.

I just have to manage it and take care of it when things happen.”Raducanu knows she faces a stacked field at Queen’s Club that includes thereigning Wimbledon champion, Barbora Krejcikova, the Olympic gold medallist Zheng ­Qinwen and the Australian Open ­winner, Madison Keys.View image in fullscreenEmma Raducanu is keeping her expectations low heading into the grass court season.Photograph: John Walton/PAHowever, her preparations were given a lift when her former coach Nick Cavaday, who left her camp for health reasons in January, returned to help her practise with her main coach Mark Petchey still at the French Open.“I’m happy to see Nick healthy, first of all,” ­Raducanu said. “It’s been a long time since we were last on court together in Australia, and Mark is in Paris commentating. Nick was around, and it is nice to have a few days with him.”The new WTA 500 tournament at Queen’s Club features an enhanced prize money of £1m ($1.4m), but the purse remains about half that of the men’s ATP 500 event, which begins next week. Raducanu did not want to be drawn on whether there should be more prize money between the men’s and women’s tour.“There is obviously a big difference, and I’m sure a lot of players will say their piece on it, but I prefer not to kind of get involved,” she said. “Whatever the situation is, I’ll kind of roll with it, but I’m never really going to take a stand, either way.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But I don’t feel like I really am playing for money. Of course, I need to sustain my team, which is extremely expensive. And with my kind of profile, coaches and team members see that. So it is a very expensive sport, but it’s not my ­motivation when I play.”As a child, Raducanu used to come to Queen’s Club with her father, although she conceded she was more interested in looking for ­brownies than watching the tennis. But now she admits she is delighted that women are finally back playing for the first time since 1973.“To be playing here is amazing. It’s the first time there’s been a women’s event for a very long time,” she said. “It’s going to be great to be playing on home turf with a good crowd.”On Monday, Raducanu will make only her second appearance in a WTA doubles tournament after agreeing to partner her fellow Briton Katie Boulter, with whom she has played in Billie Jean King matches.“It’ll be extremely special,” Boulter said. “Obviously, she’s a great player, and I’m looking forward to having the first of many more.”Explore more on these topicsEmma RaducanuTennisnewsShareReuse this content"

Having established herself as the No 1 player in the world and made such significant improvements to her game and mentality, she playedsome of the best tennisof her career in Paris en route to the final. Sabalenka felt she was ready to tackle all obstacles. With her crushing defeat against Coco Gauff in the French Open final after three difficult sets, she found out she was not.Her expression of that disappointment, however, was one of her least impressive performances of the year. During the trophy ceremony, with Gauff sitting metres away, Sabalenka’s insistence on repeatedly lamenting her “terrible match” was awkward enough. But in her press conference, after having a short amount of time to cool off, Sabalenka tripled down.Coco Gauff claims first French Open title after fightback floors Aryna SabalenkaRead moreGauff had won not because of her incredible level, she said, but because of her own mistakes off easy balls. How had her opponent made life difficult for her? By her framed shots magically landing in the court. Had Iga Swiatek reached the final, she concluded, the Pole would have won.Nothing Sabalenka said was rooted in reality. Over the years, Gauff has built herself into one of the toughest players on the tour. She is the best defensive player in the world, which she pairs with her improvisational skills, intelligence and discipline. Between her phenomenal two-handed backhand, her potent first serve and an improving forehand that is perfectly suited to clay courts with its heavy topspin, Gauff also has more than enough weapons to hold her own against the best in the world. The American makes it incredibly difficult for any opponent to play their best tennis against her, which is why Sabalenka has repeatedly struggled to do so.Under pressure from the 27-year-old in tough, windy conditions that could have easily exposed her own insecurities behind her serve and forehand, this was an immense fighting performance from Gauff, and an impressive victory. She is the first woman in history to win herfirst two grand slam titlesfrom a set down, with both victories coming against Sabalenka. Gauff is now a multiple grand slam title winner at 21 and ranked No 2 behind the Belarusian. This is no fluke.View image in fullscreenAryna Sabalenka was disconsolate after losing against Coco Gauff from a set up.Photograph: Tnani Badreddine/DPPI/ShutterstockAfter her victory, Gauff reflected on her difficulties before her first grand slam final at Roland Garros in 2022. Before that match, aged 18, she had been consumed by doubts and anxiety, unable to even breathe and questioning whether she would ever be able to handle the occasion. She learned from those lessons and has evolved into a formidable competitor who performs reliably well in the biggest moments. She now has 10 wins and three defeats in finals, a supreme record. Even after losing two WTA 1000 finals in Madrid , Gauff managed to save her best performance for the biggest final of all. Great champions thrive under pressure.By contrast, Sabalenka is still trying to exorcise old demons. As a three-time grand slam title winner and one of the most successful players of her generation, she has handled herself extremely well in some matches, but under the right circumstances against the wrong opponent she still struggles to contain her emotions. Instead of dismissing the challenge posed by an opponent who has outplayed her in the two biggest matches they have contested, she could learn from the example set by one of her closest rivals.On the path to this title, inspiration sprung up for Gauff in unexpected places. The night before the final, she was absent-mindedly scrolling on TikTok when a video of the Olympic 200m champion Gabby Thomas appeared. Thomas was explaining to a reporter how she had used written manifestations to aid in her quest for gold.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Last summer he signed a new contract at the Stadium of Light but that deal was just as much about protecting his future value as tying him down to north-east England. Under the terms of a sell-on clause inserted in the agreement reached with Dortmund, Sunderland will be due 15% of his next transfer fee.If, as expected, Bellingham passes certain milestones in Germany, and the fee increases to £32m, it will break Sunderland’s record for an outbound transfer, established by Jordan Pickford’s £30m sale to Everton in 2017. It would also make him Dortmund’s most expensive acquisition, narrowly eclipsing the sum they invested in Ousmane Dembélé in 2016.In an interview with the French radio station RMC last week Régis Le Bris, the Sunderland manager, was unstinting in his praise for Bellingham. “The player is incredibly interesting,” Le Bris said. “He’s still very young and has enormous room for improvement. But his personality is also great; he’s extremely competitive, extremely intense. Jobe is a guy with a wonderful personality. It’s been a wonderful encounter.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Our soldiers are courageously and professionally holding their section of the front, disrupting the occupier’s plans. This work does not stop for a minute.”The advance of Russian forces into the industrial region of Dnipropetrovsk for the first time would be a symbolic and strategic setback for Kyiv after the morale-boosting results of Operation Spiderweb, in which its drones attacked some of the Kremlin’s nuclear-capable bombers deep inside Russia.The Kremlin claimed in 2022 to have annexed the Donetsk, Kherson, Luhansk and Zaporizhzhia regions despite not having complete control of them. Dnipro, the administrative capital of Dnipropetrovsk, has been under near constant fire since the invasion began.Independent monitors said there was also evidence that Russia was advancing on the city of Kostyantynivka, in the Donetsk region, from several directions. The city has been a key logistical hub for Ukraine’s forces since February 2022 when Putin launched his full-scale invasion.A Ukrainian military spokesperson, Dmytro Zaporozhets, confirmed that Russian forces were trying to “build a bridgehead for an attack” on Kostyantynivka.Ukraine’s cities are also bracing for fresh night-time missile and drone attacks after US officials said they did not believe Russia had fully responded to Monday’s Operation Spiderweb, when 117 drones struck aircraft inside Russia.Russia launched one of its most intense aerial barrages of the war on Thursday night and into the early hours of Friday morning, firing 452 drones and 45 missiles at Ukrainian cities and infrastructure, but further plans were believed to be in the making.One US official told Reuters that while the timing remained unclear, a retaliatory strike could be expected in the coming days and was likely to be “asymmetrical”.With the war heating up, even the small progress made in the talks in Istanbul between the warring parties appeared at risk of unravelling. A large-scale exchange of prisoners and bodies of the dead due to be held on Monday seemed in doubt after each side accused the other of breaking the terms of the agreement.Kyiv and Moscow agreed to release all wounded soldiers and those under 25, equating to more than 1,000 people from each side. Russia said it would also hand back the remains of 6,000 killed Ukrainian soldiers.The Kremlin accused Ukraine of not turning up to collect the bodies already at the border and prevaricating over Monday’s prisoner exchange. Russian officials said they would continue to deliver further bodies to the border.Ukrainian officials accused Russia of playing “dirty games” and not sticking to the agreed parameters for the exchange by including personnel in a list of prisoners they wished recovered who were not eligible.“The Ukrainian side has unexpectedly postponed for an indefinite period both the acceptance of the bodies and the exchange of prisoners of war,” Russia’s chief negotiator, Vladimir Medinsky, said on social media.Ukraine’s Coordination Headquarters for the Treatment of Prisoners of War said no date had been set for the prisoner exchange.They said: “Unfortunately, instead of constructive dialogue, we are again faced with manipulations. We call on the Russian side to stop playing dirty games and return to constructive work to bring people back to both sides and to clearly implement the agreement in the coming days”.Explore more on these topicsUkraineRussiaEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Organisers put the attendance at 100,000.Sánchez’s government and his inner circle have faced a series of corruption allegations over the past year. Pressure on his Spanish Socialist Workers’ party (PSOE) has increased over recent days after a former member of the party was accused of trying to wage a smear campaign against the Guardia Civil police unit investigating the prime minister’s wife, Begoña Gómez, his brother, David Sánchez, and the former transport minister José Luis Ábalos.Leire Díaz, who resigned from the PSOE after recordings were leaked in which she appeared to offer judicial leniency in return for compromising information on senior members of the unit, has denied working on behalf of the prime minister or the party, saying she was researching a book on corruption.As demonstrators congregated in the midday heat of the Plaza de España, carrying placards bearing messages such as “Sánchez traitor” and “government resign”, the PP’s leader, Alberto Núñez Feijóo, renewed his call for a snap election.View image in fullscreenThe People’s party leader, Alberto Núñez Feijóo, speaking in the Plaza de España.Photograph: Thomas Coex/AFP/Getty Images“Spain needs a revolution of decency and freedom – and we will lead that revolution from the streets and at the ballot boxes,” he told the crowd. “Mr Sánchez, stop hiding, stop lying and stop running.Spainknows only too well who you are and what you have done. Yield to democracy. Call an election: we want one now because no one voted for this, not even your supporters.”The prime minister has accused his political and media opponents of conducting a“harassment and bullying operation”against him and his wife, arguing that false allegations levelled at her are designed to bring about his “personal and political collapse”.Spain’s socialist leader has defied expectations. Are there lessons for Starmer?Read moreGómez is being investigated for alleged corruption and influence peddling after a complaint by the pressure group Manos Limpias (Clean Hands), a self-styled trade union with far-right links that has a long history of using the courts to pursue political targets. Manos Limpias hasaccused Gómez of using her influenceas the wife of the prime minister to secure sponsors for a university master’s degree course that she ran. Sánchez has described the case against his wife as baseless and “an ugly fit-up driven by the far-right groups behind the complaint”.Meanwhile, David Sánchez is facing trial over allegations of influence peddling and other offences in a case that also began with accusations from Manos Limpias and other groups. He denies the charges.Sánchez’s administration has also been facing questions since it emerged in February last year that an assistant to Ábalos, once a close ally and confidant of the prime minister, had been arrested on suspicion of taking payments to facilitate contracts for face masks during the coronavirus pandemic.Meanwhile, the PP, which wasousted from governmentseven years ago after a series of corruption scandals, is itself under scrutiny on several fronts, not least over itshandling of the deadly floodslast year in Valencia, one of the regions it governs.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

She has also been forced to defend herrelationship with her partner, Alberto González Amador, after judges began investigating his business dealings.González Amador is under investigation for a variety of alleged offences and has been charged with two counts of tax fraud and one of document forgery in connection to fees he charged a company that imported face masks during the pandemic. Ayuso has said her partner has been targeted by “all the powers of the state” purely because of his relationship with her, while a member of her administration recently said the “presumption of innocence should be respected”.The government attempted to play down the protests, dismissing them as a sign of the PP’s desperation.Spain’s pugnacious transport minister, Óscar Puente, posted aerial pictures showing the plaza far from full, while the digital transformation minister, Óscar López, said the protest had been called to distract attention from Feijóo’s underperforming leadership and from Ayuso’s problems.“They’re really nervous,” López wrote on X. “Because they’ve filled the Plaza de España with insults but not with people … While they sling mud, we move forwards.”Explore more on these topicsSpainPedro SánchezEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

The post does not reflect the views of ABC News and violated our standards.”According to ascreenshotof the post, Moran said that Miller was not the brains behind Trumpism and his ability to translate the movement’s “impulses” into policy was “not brains. It’s bile.”“You can see that his hatreds are his spiritual nourishment,” Moran added. “He eats his hate.”He added of Trump: “Trump is a world-class hater. But his hatred only a means to an end, and that end [is] his own glorification.”Miller shot back,saying: “The most important fact about Terry’s full public meltdown is what it shows about the corporate press in America. For decades, the privileged anchors and reporters narrating and gatekeeping our society have been radicals adopting a journalist’s pose. Terry pulled off his mask.”The White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, described Moran’s rhetoric as “unacceptable and unhinged” on Fox News. “I think this speaks to the distrust that the American public have in the legacy media,” she added. JD Vance, the vice-president,describedMoran’s post as a “vile smear”.ABC News’ suspension of Moran comes nearly six months after the organisationagreed to pay $15mto a Trump presidential foundation or museum after he filed a defamation case following anchor George Stephanopoulos repeating an assertion on ABC’s This Week that Trump had been found “liable for rape” in a lawsuit filed by the columnist E Jean Carroll.

It acknowledged reports of injuries but did not specify how many people it believed had been affected.Bodies were brought to Nasser hospital in Khan Younis. Al-Awda hospital said it had received the body of a 42-year-old man, as well as 29 people who had been injured near another GHF distribution point.The Reuters news agency reported that four people had been killed by the Israeli fire, while the Associated Press put the death toll at “at least” five.The deaths bring the number of people who have been killed while trying to find food in Gaza since 27 May, when GHF became responsible for civilian food provision, to 110. More than 1,000 have been injured.Witnesses said Sunday’s shooting in southern Gaza occurred at about 6am, when they had been told the site would open. Many had headed towards it early to try to get desperately needed food before the crowds. The military had announced on Friday that the sites would be open from 6am and that the area would be a closed military zone from 6pm until 6am.A GHF spokesperson said there had been “no incident at or in [the] surrounding vicinity” of any distribution site.Adham Dahman, 30, who was at Nasser hospital with a bandage on his chin, told Associated Press that a tank had fired in their direction. “We didn’t know how to escape,” he said. “This is trap for us, not aid.”Zahed Ben Hassan, another witness, said someone next to him had been shot in the head. He said he and others had pulled the body from the scene and managed to flee to the hospital.“They said it was a safe area from 6am until 6pm … so why did they start shooting at us?” he said. “There was light out, and they have their cameras and can clearly see us.”Sanaa Doghmah told Reuters that her husband, Khaled, 36, was fatally shot in the head while trying to reach a distribution site in Rafah to collect food for their five children.Khaled’s aunt, Salwah, said at his funeral: “He was going to get food for his children and himself, to make them live, feed them, because they don’t have a pinch of flour at home.”There have been frequent shootings in the past two weeks near the new hubs, where thousands of Palestinians are being directed to collect food.The GHF announced on Wednesday that its operations would be suspended for 24 hours after Israeli troops opened fire on a crowd of Palestinians, as it pressed Israel to improve civilian safety beyond the perimeter of its distribution sites.Israeli troopskilled at least 27people and injured hundreds on Tuesday far beyond the perimeter of the distribution sites. They denied firing at civilians, but an Israel Defense Forces official admitted soldiers had fired “warning shots toward several suspects who advanced toward the troops” near the food distribution site, without specifying who the suspects were.On 1 June, 31 Palestinians were killed by Israeli fire as they went to receive food. Israel said it had fired warning shots towards several suspects who advanced towards troops.Q&AWhy is it so difficult to report on Gaza?ShowCoverage of the war in Gaza is constrained by Israeli attacks on Palestinian journalists and a bar on international reporters entering the Gaza Strip to report independently on the war.Israel has not allowed foreign reporters to enter Gaza since 7 October 2023, unless they are under Israeli military escort. Reporters who join these trips have no control over where they go, and otherrestrictionsinclude a bar on speaking to Palestinians in Gaza.Palestinian journalists and media workers inside Gaza have paid a heavy price for their work reporting on the war, with over180 killedsince the conflict began.The committee to protect journalists has determined that at least 19 of them “were directly targeted by Israeli forces in killings which CPJ classifies as murders”.Foreign reporters based in Israel filed alegal petitionseeking access to Gaza, but it was rejected by the supreme court on security grounds. Private lobbying by diplomats and public appeals byprominent journalistsandmedia outletshave been ignored by the Israeli government.To ensure accurate reporting from Gaza given these restrictions, the Guardian works with trusted journalists on the ground; our visual​​ teams verif​y photo and videos from third parties; and we use clearly sourced data from organisations that have a track record of providing accurate information in Gaza during past conflicts, or during other conflicts or humanitarian crises.Emma Graham-Harrison, chief Middle East correspondentWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Israelimposed a blockade on all suppliesto Gaza in March, saying Hamas was seizing deliveries for its fighters, which the group denies. A global hunger monitor said in May that half a million people in the strip faced starvation. TheIPC estimatedthat nearly 71,000 children under five were expected to be “acutely malnourished”, with 14,100 cases expected to be severe in the next 11 months.The hubs are set up inside Israeli military zones, to which independent media have no access, and are run by GHF, a new group of mainly US contractors. Israel wants it to replace a system coordinated by the UN and international aid groups.The UN and other humanitarian organisations have rejected the new system, saying the GHF will not be able to meet the needs of Gaza’s 2.3 million people and that it allows Israel to use food as a weapon to control the population.Associated Press and Reuters contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warGazaPalestinian territoriesIsraelMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

She also said employers should be able to stop their staff wearing burqas if they wanted to.Her remarks caused consternation among some Muslims. Afzal Khan, the Labour MP and vice-chair of the all-party parliamentary group on British Muslims, said: “Trying to outflankReform UKon immigration or culture wars doesn’t just risk alienating moderate voters, it erodes trust in politics itself.“Britain faces serious challenges: a struggling NHS, a deepening cost of living crisis, economic uncertainty, and a polarised, often toxic debate on immigration. These problems won’t be solved by scapegoating or soundbites. They demand serious leadership – not stunts designed to grab headlines or appease the far right.”Chris Philp, the shadow home secretary, was asked about whether he would speak to women in burqas, and he confirmed he had done so in the past.Reform’s decision to raise the issue in parliament and Nigel Farage’s call for a debate on the burqa prompted the party’s chair, Zia Yusuf, to resign last week.He has since returned, however, saying he was not upset by the idea of banning the burqa but had been exhausted and demoralised by racist abuse against him as a prominent Muslim politician.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He is expected to take up a portfolio of roles for Reform, including leading its government efficiency unit, which will look at spending by the councils the party controls.The Reform focus on burqas on Friday caused leading Muslim groups and politicians to accuse the party ofinflaming hostility.The party’s deputy leader, Richard Tice, hasdefended the decisionto start a debate, saying the issue cannot be “forced underground”.Badenoch said in her interview: “If you were to ask me where you start with integration – sharia courts, all of this nonsense sectarianism, things like first-cousin marriage – there’s a whole heap of stuff that is far more insidious and that breeds more problems. My view is that people should be allowed to wear whatever they want, not what their husband is asking them to wear or what their community says that they should wear.“If you come into my constituency surgery, you have to remove your face covering, whether it’s a burqa or a balaclava. I’m not talking to people who are not going to show me their face, and I also believe that other people should have that control. Organisations should be able to decide what their staff wear; it shouldn’t be something that people should be able to override.”Employers are able to set their own dress codes. They could face challenges under equality and human rights law if they were to restrict their staff from observing their religion through their clothing, but rules can override this if they are proportionate and for a legitimate aim such as ensuring effective communication or for health and safety.The former Labour home secretary Jack Straw revealed in 2006 that he had asked women who came to his constituency surgeries wearing burqas to remove them, arguing that the conversation would be of greater value without a face covering.Explore more on these topicsKemi BadenochConservativesReform UKIslamReligionnewsShareReuse this content"

On a visit to the capital of the UK’s oil and gas industry on Monday last week he welcomed adefecting Aberdeen Conservative councillor, the 13th switch to his party’s ranks in Scotland to date.Reform is hoping to make political hay from the discontent surrounding the government’s North Sea policies, the demise of the oil and gas basin and the vast workforce that depends on it. The populist party has vowed to reverse Labour’sban on fresh North Sea oil and gas drillingas a “day one” priority if elected to power in 2029.Farage’s naked targeting of the Granite City and of net zero – which he hasdescribed as “lunacy”and the “next Brexit” – has some in Westminster and the energy industry asking what would once have been unthinkable: will be forced to water down or even U-turn on its North Sea pledges?Green light for North Sea?Keir Starmer’s party swept to power last summer with a manifesto pledge to end new North Sea oil and gas projects and make Britain a clean energy superpower. But in less than a year the government has bent to the backlash against some of its most high-profile policies on benefits and winter fuel allowances, stoking speculation that its position on the North Sea might be the next to crumble.Industry sources believe ministers may be poised to give the green light to new North Sea projects from this autumn. The Guardian understands that senior government advisers have told North Sea investors that new drilling could still move ahead despite the election promise, provided the projects are close to existing pipeline infrastructure and do not extend into “greenfield” areas.One energy investor said advisers in the Treasury and No 10 had “quite openly” signalled that the door would be left open for new oil and gas projects to proceed despite climate commitments. “Myself and a number of colleagues have been told that the government is moving towards the idea of allowing new licences,” the source said.However, the claims are at odds with the green agenda set out by Ed Miliband, secretary of state at the Department forEnergySecurity and Net Zero (DESNZ), who has previously described plans to develop the Jackdaw and Rosebank oilfields in the North Sea as “an act of climate vandalism”.Those two oilfields, which are caught in along-running legal battle over their emissions, will be a critical test of how Labour’s desperation to counter the rise of Reform rubs up against its green principles.Cutting greenhouse gases has strong support in the UK, withYouGov polling in Marchshowing 61% of adults support or strongly support the government’s target of reducing emissions to net zero by 2050. About 24% oppose or strongly oppose the policy.But with domestically produced oil and gas being replaced with imports from Qatar and the US, sources believe the Treasury is anxious to allow projects to move ahead to protect the more than 200,000 jobs that rely on the North Sea sector, and the billions in forecast tax revenues the industry generates.“Within the Treasury there is a desire to interpret the manifesto commitment loosely,” a second industry source said. “If there is an existing licence related to a field which means it might not be considered a ‘greenfield’ site then perhaps an expansion of that area could be acceptable.”The North Sea contributes £25bn in value to the UK economy each year, according to the trade group Offshore Energies UK, which is more than five times the contribution of the UK steel industry and twice the contribution of the UK car industry.“I suspect there will be some difficult internal rows about what counts as a ‘new licence’ between DESNZ and the Treasury - but I suspect that ultimately the Treasury will win this battle, with support from No 10,” the source added.Room for manoeuvre?Labour’s manifesto offers some room for manoeuvre: it promised that the party would not “issue new licences to explore new fields”, but would also not revoke existing North Sea licences.This means that controversial North Sea oil and gas projects at Rosebank, Jackdaw and Cambo – which were granted licences by the previous government – could in theory be granted final consent to move ahead without breaching the pledge.Oil companies that hope to drill new wells within their previously licensed areas, known as “in-fill drilling”, could also be allowed to extract more oil and gas from their existing projects. The sources have suggested that even more leeway could be created within the definition of the manifesto promise.The pledge was welcomed by green groups as a clear sign of the government’s intent to meet its legally binding net zero targets as the climate crisis intensifies. However, critics of the policy – who include backbench Labour MPs and union leaders – fear the economic fallout may outweigh any climate benefits as imported hydrocarbons increasingly replace North Sea oil and gas.UK carbon costs graphicBritain’s trade unions, which donate generously to Labour, fear that job losses in the industry and its supply chains are accelerating quicker than companies can pivot towards the green economy.Sharon Graham, the general secretary of Unite, said: “Letting go of one rope before we have hold of another by ending oil and gas licences is not acceptable. It threatens both our national security and jobs.”“Oil and gas workers cannot be the coal miners of our generation,” she added. “Britain needs to maintain skills and invest in the industries of the future. Jobless transitions will not be accepted by Unite, neither will jam tomorrow. If Labour do not back workers other voices fill the vacuum.”Andy Prendergast, the GMB’s national secretary, said the union has called on the government to re-appraise the UK’s energy policy. “Existing policy is simply offshoring responsibility, importing virtue, and undercutting a transition for energy workers in the North Sea,” he said.UK energy mix 2050One North Sea oil worker said the government’s stance represented “nothing short of a strangulation of an industry and of the north-east Scottish economy”. He voted Reform in the last general election and said he could not name a single person who would vote for Labour.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Unions and climate campaigners are demanding an emergency funding package of £1.9bn a year to help with the transition be included in Rachel Reeves’s spending review on Wednesday.“It’s vital that we don’t leave oil and gas workers’ future in the hands of private companies who put their profits above workers’ security and the climate time and time again,” she said.“We urgently need a renewable energy system fit for the 21st century that can bring down bills, helping our energy security and the climate at the same time. But we must bring workers and communities along and ensure that wind manufacturing and renewable energy jobs stay here in the UK, rather than leaving other countries to benefit from the booming green economy.”‘Not clear cut’The government’s independent climate advisers, the Climate Change Committee (CCC), have called for tight controls on any new North Sea production but have also found that the emissions case for a ban on new projects is “not clear cut”.“The CCC has not been able to establish the net impact on global emissions of new UK oil and gas extraction,” the advisers said in a letter to former energy secretary Kwasi Kwarteng in 2022.This is partly because the UK’s oil and gas has a relatively low carbon footprint relative to the countries that supply its gas imports. The UK will continue to be a net importer of fossil fuels by 2050 even when keeping to its net zero ambition.Under the CCC’s forecasts, oil and gas will tumble from about 75% of the UK’s primary energy demand now to about 23% by 2050. But that would still mean the UK needs over 14m tonnes of oil equivalent each year – most of which will be imported. The UK is increasingly reliant on imports of liquified natural gas from the US and Qatar – which have a far higher carbon intensity than North Sea gas – as well as piped gas from Norway.On the one hand the UK could help lower global emissions by replacing some of these fossil fuel imports with domestic hydrocarbons, but on the other hand any extra oil and gas produced by the UK could risk creating a global oversupply of fossil fuels “that wouldpose a risk to the aims of the Paris agreement”.What oil and gas remains in the North Sea is becoming harder to extract, meaning the basin will still be in terminal decline even if the government loosens its stance.The policy against new North Sea oil projects emerged after the global energy watchdog, the International Energy Agency, warned in 2021 that no new fossil projects could move ahead if the world hoped to meet its climate targets.Here too the hard lines appear to be softening. By 2023 the Paris-based agency clarified its stance, stating that “no new conventional long-lead time oil projects” should be approved but that “investing in existing fossil fuel supply, however, is still needed”.The government is expected to clarify its plans for the future of the North Sea through an industry consultation that closed at the end of April. Its response, which is expected in the autumn, is likely to rule out a return to annual North Sea licensing rounds – but industry insiders expect that it will allow at least some new projects to progress.That could leave Miliband in an awkward position. There have been “discussions within the Labour party for months over how to handle his potential resignation”, said an industry source.“I do think the government is, belatedly, becoming a little more pragmatic about [the North Sea],” the second source added. “And I suspect that ultimately pragmatism will win the day. But it may be too late, honestly. In the North Sea we’re on a worrying downward spiral of job losses and an accelerated production decline.”A DESNZ spokesperson dismissed the claims as “secondhand speculation” which “bear no relation” to the government’s work to “implement our manifesto position to not issue new licences to explore new oil and gas fields”.The Treasury did not respond to the Guardian’s request beyond the DESNZ statement.Explore more on these topicsEnergy industryOil and gas companiesOilGasEnergyScotlandanalysisShareReuse this content"

The risk assessment process is viewed as key aspect of the act.Meta’s content moderation changes ‘hugely concerning’, says Molly Rose FoundationRead moreIn a letter to Ofcom’s chief executive, Melanie Dawes, organisations including the Molly Rose Foundation, the NSPCC and the Internet Watch Foundation described the prospect of AI-driven risk assessments as a “retrograde and highly alarming step”.They said: “We urge you to publicly assert that risk assessments will not normally be considered as ‘suitable and sufficient’, the standard required by … the act, where these have been wholly or predominantly produced through automation.”The letter also urged the watchdog to “challenge any assumption that platforms can choose to water down their risk assessment processes”.A spokesperson for Ofcom said: “We’ve been clear that services should tell us who completed, reviewed and approved their risk assessment.

Our survey of members showed that people are angry and terrified and some reported suicidal thoughts, which is very concerning,” she said.“We must address the systemic failures that keep disabled people out of work and public life before we start looking at reforming the benefits system.”About 900,000 people, or 27% of Wales’ population, live with a disability, according to Public Health Network Cymru – higher than the UK average of 22% – and 11% of working-age people, compared with 7% in England.The proposed changes would have amarkedly uneven impact across the UK, earlier Policy in Practice analysis found. In Wales, Blaenau Gwent, Merthyr Tydfil and Neath Port Talbot are the worst-affected areas per capita.View image in fullscreenTrevor Palmer said Pip made up about 60% of his income.Photograph: Trevor PalmerTrevor Palmer, an entrepreneur from Newport diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in 1994, said losing access to Pip would “severely restrict” his day-to-day life and in effect shut down his charity ResponseABLE Assistance, which works on equality issues for disabled people around the world.“It would ruin my life, to be honest. I’m 70 and I have a pension, but Pip is about 60% of my income. I’m a full-time wheelchair user and I use it for transport and things like adaptations to the car. Without it, I wouldn’t be able to go out.”A UK government spokesperson said that most people currently getting Pip would continue to receive it. A review of the Pip assessment would involve “working with disabled people and key organisations representing them – including in Wales – to consider how best to do this”, they said.“We will never compromise on protecting people who need our support and our reforms will mean the social security system will always be there for those who will never be able to work, and that their income is protected,” the spokesperson added.When the changes to disability benefits were proposed in March, Wales’ first minister, Eluned Morgan, called on the UK government to conduct a Wales-specific impact assessment, which the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) declined to do.The proposalshave caused frictionbetween the Senedd and the government in Westminster, which promised a “partnership in power” in which the two Labour administrations would “work in lockstep” after Keir Starmer led the party to a national election victory last year.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Recent polling suggested Labour was trailing in third place, with its worst vote share – 18% – since devolution 25 years ago.UK government ministers have said the changes to disability benefits are essential to overhaul a “broken system” amid growing numbers of working-age people claiming health-related benefits.More than 3m UK households will be hit by the changes to disability and incapacity benefits starting from next year. Official estimates forecast 250,000 people, including 50,000 children, will be pushed into poverty as a result.In Wales, a comprehensive10-year disabled people’s rights planis under consultation at the Senedd. The DWP also took part ina recent inquiryinto Wales’ outsized disability employment gap, which Davies of Disability Wales said made the proposed cuts “all the more perplexing”.“It’s like these changes have arrived in a vacuum,” she said.The Welsh government said: “These welfare reforms are impacting people in Wales, and we are listening closely to those with lived experience, as well as the organisations that represent them. Our response to the green paper will reflect the concerns we’ve heard, and we urge the UK government to also listen carefully to what people in Wales are saying.”Explore more on these topicsWalesBenefitsDisabilitynewsShareReuse this content"

The co-chairs of the BMA’s resident doctors committee (RDC) have urged their estimated 55,000 members to vote for the action.The six experts say there was a genuine case for resident doctors to receive a big salary increase after years of erosion in the value of their pay, but that it had largely been addressed by the 22% they received last year for 2023/24 and 2024/25 and the average 5.4% they were given last month for 2025/26.They also say the RDC leaders’ call for resident doctors to back a fresh six-month campaign of walkouts is mistaken. “A strike now would harm patients and diminish the cause of these doctors. The calls for strike misjudge the mood in the country. There is no spare money. This is a futile gesture guiding people into a maze without a thread”, they write in their letter.“In our view the NHS is at a more perilous state than at any time in our careers. A doctors strike would further diminish the ability of the NHS to deliver, and play into the hands of those who don’t believe in an NHS – publicly funded [and] based on need not want.“We urge resident doctors to keep to the spirit of the Hippocratic oath – vote for the NHS and vote No to strike action.”The other signatories are David Colin-Thome, the Department of Health’s national clinical director for primary care under Tony Blair and Gordon Brown; Dr James Kingsland, a GP and former ministerial adviser; and Dr Fiona Cornish, a senior GP in Cambridge and former member of the BMA’s GP committee.The health secretary, Wes Streeting, appointed Oldham, who worked for the previous Labour and coalition governments, as a senior adviser in March on his plans to create more “neighbourhood health” services as part of the government’s forthcoming 10-year plan for the NHS.Responding to the letter, Streeting urged resident doctors to reject industrial action in their ballot, which ends on 7 July.“Strikes should only ever be a last resort. Resident doctors have had a 28.9% pay rise [since 2022/23], and they have a government working with them to improve their career progression and conditions.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Instead of cutting the NHS recovery off at its knees, work with us to turn the health service around”, he said.However, RDC co-chairs Dr Melissa Ryan and Dr Ross Nieuwoudt, said this year’s 5.4% pay award – the biggest in the public sector – was too little to help them restore the lost value of their earnings since 2008.“Resident doctors are currently paid 23% less than they were in 2008. Even after this year’s pay award it would still need a rise of 26% to bring pay back to that level.“We don’t believe any of the doctors in this letter are worth 23% less than they were in 2008, and neither presumably do they. The question, then, is how we restore the value of this profession, how quickly, and how we work with government to get there.“At the rate Wes Streeting is suggesting it would take more than a decade to restore our pay. The NHS does not have that time,” they said.Explore more on these topicsNHSDoctorsTrade unionsIndustrial actionHealth policyHealthPublic services policynewsShareReuse this content"

He denies charges of criminal damage, violent disorder and aggravated burglary.Plastow, a script editor, and five more of the 18, who are all being held in prison, have been given a trial date of April next year.Custody time limits stipulate that defendants should not spend more than six months in jail awaiting trial. Under new sentencing rules for England and Wales, which allow the release of convicted criminals after serving a third of their sentences, Plastow will have served the equivalent of a sentence of more than five years before going to trial.His mother, Jane Plastow, 66, an academic at the University of Leeds, believes it is the longest anyone will have been held in jail awaiting trial on protest-related charges and fears for his mental health. In a prison diary published in Inside Time, her son wrote about having suicidal thoughts.His mother said: “It’s outrageous, it’s terrible. Will is a kind of glass-half-empty guy, so he tends towards [believing in] the worst possible outcome. Every day, which has become a kind of ritual, I have to say: ‘Yes, you are going to get out of there, this is not the end of your life. They are not going to be able to keep you in for years and years and years.’ Because you just obviously feel so helpless and hopeless locked up in that place.”She said she had offered a surety of £50,000, using money from an inheritance, for his bail application, said he could live with her and that all internet access would be removed from the house. He also would have been tagged, had his passport and smartphone removed and had to report regularly to the police, but he was still denied bail.Jane said the judge indicated her son posed a risk of breaking the law again. “What you’re being required to prove is a negative – well, you can never prove the negative, can you?” she said. “You can’t prove that you’re not going to do anything.”Another of the Filton 18, Kamran Ahmed, was granted bail but the decision was overturned on appeal.Will Plastow’s partner of 10 years, Valentina Tschismarov, a video editor, said: “I think the worst that I have personally seen him was when his bail application was denied, which obviously was really disheartening for all of us. Shortly afterwards myself and his mum went to visit him together and I was very worried at that point because he was really shaken, just out of it.“Even on the phone in the weeks after that, he just sounded very distant and kind of broken down. It seems incredibly disproportionate. I always imagined that there were these protections in place and you couldn’t just have somebody jailed without a conviction for these amounts of time. I think people are not really aware.”The longest that any Just Stop Oil activists have spent in jail awaiting trial was the nearly 10 months – still over the custody time limit – spent on remand by two of the Heathrow 10, who had planned a peaceful demonstration at the airport last July.The Filton 18 were initially arrested under the Terrorism Act, which meant they could be held for 14 days without charge. None have been charged with terrorism offences but the Crown Prosecution Service has said there was a “terrorism connection”.The Ministry of Justice referred the Guardian to the Judicial Office, which said it could not comment on individual cases.This article was amended on 8 June 2025. Valentina Tschismarov is a video editor, not a script editor as an earlier version said.Explore more on these topicsUK newsnewsShareReuse this content"

They said his driving licence had been suspended for 120 days and that he had been issued a fine of 1,822 lei (£305).Tate confirmed some of the details in a post on X, but denied speeding, claiming the police officer’s radar gun must have been “calibrated incorrectly”.“This morning at 6:15am, on a completely empty mountain pass in the middle of the country, I was stopped by police and accused of speeding,” he said. “They said I was driving 197 [sic] on a 40 [sic] in one of my 100 sports cars – and although there was nobody around – my licence must be suspended for 4 months and I would have the [sic] pay the crippling fine of 300 usd [sic]. I can NOT afford this bill. I explained to the officer that his Radar gun must be calibrated incorrectly because I would never do this.”Tate described the allegation that he was speeding as “grossly false” and said he looked forward to explaining himself when he appeared in court on Monday.Andrew and Tristan Tate are facing prosecution in Romania over allegations of trafficking minors, sexual intercourse with a minor and money laundering. A separate case against them, in which they are accused of human trafficking and forming a criminal gang to sexually exploit women, has been sent back to prosecutors. They deny the charges.UK prosecutors also recently confirmed charges against the pair. Andrew Tate faces 10 charges including rape, actual bodily harm, human trafficking and controlling prostitution for gain – charges connected to three alleged victims.Tristan Tate faces 11 charges including rape, actual bodily harm and human trafficking – charges connected to one alleged victim.An international arrest warrant was issued by Bedfordshire police for the siblings over the allegations, dating back to between 2012 and 2015, which they deny.The pair are due to be extradited to the UK after the conclusion of proceedings in Romania.Explore more on these topicsAndrew TateRomaniaEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Musk turned his back on the party in 2022 and contributed $270m to Trump’s re-election campaign in 2024, providing crucial help in the Republican’s eventual victory.As the Trump-Musk feud intensified on Thursday, Muskposted on X: “In November next year, we fire all politicians who betrayed the American people.,” clearly referring to any politician who supported Trump’s budget bill.Ro Khanna, a Democratic congressman, reportedly talked with one of Musk’s “senior confidants” on last week about whether Musk might now want to help the Democrats in the midterm elections next year.“Having Elon speak out against the irrational tariff policy, against the deficit exploding Trump bill, and the anti-science and anti-immigrant agenda can help check Trump’s unconstitutional administration,” Khannatold Semafor.“I look forward to Elon turning his fire against Maga Republicans instead of Democrats in 2026,” Khanna, who has argued that his party was unwise to alienate Musk, told the outlet.However, leftwing politicians, including Vermont senator Bernie Sanders and New York congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, have publicly pictured Musk as what voters should be against: powerful wealthy billionaires seeking influence through politics.Sanders told CNN’s State of the Union Sunday that Musk had “evolved” into an extremist since he voted for Obama in 2008.“Over the years he has developed into a rightwing extremist. The issue and drama over what happened last week is that we are living, increasingly, in an oligarchic society. Musk said: ‘Hey listen, I spent $270m dollars to get you elected. I bought you the presidency …”“This is a fight between oligarchs. It’s a fight about power among the few, and it’s really an embarrassment for those of us who believe in democracy and the rule of law,” Sanders added.Musksaid last monththat he planned to spend “a lot less” on political campaigns as he scaled back and ultimately exited his time in government, where Trump had tasked him with massively slashing federal spending and jobs.Trump-Musk feud shows what happens when unregulated money floods politicsRead more“In terms of political spending I’m going to do a lot less in the future,” Musk told a Bloomberg forum in Doha. Asked why, he responded: “I think I’ve done enough.”But Musk’s opposition to Trump’s “One Big Beautiful” bill budget proposal, calling it an“disgusting abomination”, by definition puts him in relative proximity to Democratic positions on that issue.Booker was asked if agreed with Musk about the planned legislation that Trump has made a centerpiece of his administration. “I agree that it’s going to saddle this country with trillions of dollars of debt, endanger our entire economy … This is a morally wrong bill. And it’s definitely, definitely an economically wrong bill as well.”“This is not about right or left, it’s about right or wrong,” he added. “And I welcome Elon Musk, not to my campaign. I welcome him right now, not to sit back and just fire off tweets, to get involved right now in a more substantive way and putting pressure on congresspeople and senators to not do this.”Explore more on these topicsUS politicsCory BookerElon MuskDonald TrumpUS political financingTrump administrationDemocratsnewsShareReuse this content"

It also puts all the other steps in the industry and the value chain in danger.”She said Europe must step in to save the sector because it was fundamental for military security and was a large employer, and if it failed, the continent would be left reliant on the US and China for a key manufacturing material.There is also the growing problem of cheap Chinese steel imports, something the European Commission has in its sights in talks with Beijing over its dumping of goods in the EU, which are also covering the oversupply of cars andfast fashion. Chinese steel imports soared by 36% in the first quarter of 2025, according to Eurostat.According to Henne, Russian steel is still appearing on the market, at a rate of 3m-4m tonnes a year, just short of the 3.8m tonnes the EU as a whole exports to the US.The US doubling of the tariff on steel and aluminium importsdoes not apply to the UK, which will continue to pay 25% until 9 July and is racing to implement the terms of a bilateral dealstruck last monththat would take the rate down to zero.Ministers are working to ensure the UK’s biggest player in the sector, Tata Steel,is not excluded from the dealbecause it has begun importing semi-finished products from India and Europe since closing its blast furnace in south Wales last year. This could breach US rules that require all steel to be “melted and poured” in the country from which it is imported.US representatives also have concerns that British Steel, which is owned by China’s Jingye group, could be used as a “back door” to bring in Chinese products. The UK government used emergency legislation totake control of the company’s plant in Scunthorpe, and according to the Sunday Times, ministers now face a standoff with Jingye over a £1bn-plus compensation claim to get it to relinquish its interest.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

So the cost of manufacturing has gone up,” she said.The impact “is a lesson that the US has to learn, unfortunately, I believe, the hard way,” she said. “What they are doing is actually limiting their own growth potential.”In its second-quarter outlook report issued last Thursday, Eurofer, the EU steel trade association, said the US tariffs had dealt “a severe blow” to recovery expectations. It has called on the EU to bring in emergency measures to help save the industry.“There is a lot that we can do to save the steel industry,” said Henne, calling on the European Commission to do more to ensure hydrogen comes on stream at a competitive price to reduce the reliance on oil- and gas-fuelled furnaces.“Reducing the tariffs would be a good thing, but equally important for us is competitive energy pricing,” she said.Explore more on these topicsSteel industryEuropeEnergy industryTrump tariffsTariffsnewsShareReuse this content"

The head of the national police, Carlos Fernando Triana, said the suspect was injured in the struggle and was receiving treatment.Two other people – a man and a woman – were also wounded, and a Glock-style pistol was seized.The motive for the attack is not yet known, but Colombia’s defence minister, Pedro Arnulfo Sánchez, vowed that the military, police and intelligence services would deploy all their capabilities to find out what happened. Sánchez also offered a 3bn peso (£540,000) reward for information leading to the identification and capture of those responsible for the attack.Murder of Colombian model sparks outrage over rising femicidesRead morePetro offered his sympathies to Uribe’s family and said Colombia was thinking of him.“I hope Miguel Uribe survives,” said the president. “That’s what I want above all else and that’s what society should feel as we join our hearts and our energy so that he’ll be OK.”Petro later confirmed in a speech on Saturday night that the person arrested was a minor and that the investigation would focus on finding who had ordered the attack.“For now, there is nothing more than hypothesis,” he said, adding that failures in security protocols would also be looked into.The Spanish government condemned the assassination attempt. “Violence has no place in our societies,” it said. “Spain sends its wishes for a speedy recovery to the victim, to all his family and friends, and to the Colombian people.”The US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, also condemned the attack, but said it was the result of what he termed “violent leftist rhetoric coming from the highest levels of the Colombian government”.Petro and Donald Trump have recently clashed over theUS migrant deportation flights that pushed the two countries to the brink of a trade war.Uribe is from a prominent family. His grandfather, Julio César Turbay Ayala, served as Colombia’s president from 1978 to 1982, his father was a businessman and union leader and his mother, the journalist Diana Turbay, was killed in a rescue operation after being kidnapped in 1990 by an armed group under the command of the cartel leader Pablo Escobar.

She talks about her long road to recognition, and using her profile to support other writersLisa AllardiceSun 8 Jun 2025 07.00 EDTShareBack in 2013, Bernardine Evaristo gave a reading in a south London bookshop from her novelMr Loverman. Only six people showed up, a couple of them were dozing and she realised they were homeless people who had come to find somewhere comfortable to sleep. Last month, the hit TV adaptationMr Loverman, about a 74-year-old gay Caribbean man set in Hackney, east London, wontwo Baftas, including leading actor forLennie James, making him the first Black British actor to win the TV award in its 70-year history. “I checkedWikipedia!” Evaristo exclaims of this shocking fact when we meet in London.Evaristo’s long career is one of firsts and creating them for others. In 2019, at the age of 60, she became the first Black woman to win the Booker prize –shared with Margaret Atwood– forGirl, Woman, Other, 12 interwoven stories of Black, female and one non-binary character. She is also the first Black woman to become president of the Royal Society of Literature (RSL) – only the second woman in its 200-year history, not to mention the first not to have attended Oxford, Cambridge or Eton. And this week she became the recipient of the Women’s prize inaugural Outstanding Contribution award.“I became an ‘overnight success’,” she writes of her Booker win in her 2021 memoir, Manifesto, “after 40 years working professionally in the arts.” It is these now 45 years that are being recognised by this new award. Ironically, she has never won the Women’s prize, although she wasshortlistedfor Girl, Woman, Other. “This award more than makes up for it,” she beams.View image in fullscreenThe Bafta-winning Mr Loverman was originally thought to be too ‘niche’ for TV.Photograph: Des Willie/BBC/Fable PicturesThe Booker judges’ decision to break the rules and split the prize between Evaristo and Atwood caused anoutcry, with many accusing the panel of undermining the historic recognition of a Black female novelist. Evaristo was cheerfully unperturbed. “It couldn’t have gone better for me, to be honest,” she insists now. “I really do mean that. In terms of how it accelerated my career and gave me so many more opportunities and such a large audience for my work.” Girl, Woman, Other was on the bestseller list for nine consecutive weeks. Barack Obamachoseit as one of his favourite books of 2019. Hamish Hamilton reissued her backlist. After being told for decades that there was no market for her work, she was suddenly in demand.So much so that a 2021 Private Eye cartoon – now on her fridge – showed a guy exclaiming: “Come quick!Bernardine Evaristoisn’t on Radio 4!” Although she found it funny, there is an unmistakeable whiff of condescension. “Why notice me?” she asks. “When there are many people who are constantly in the media, who are not Black women. You notice the Black woman and suddenly it’s too much. You want us to be quiet and invisible.”Tall and good-naturedly open, Evaristo is in no danger of keeping quiet or becoming invisible. Today she is wearing a hot-pink blouse the same shade as the trouser suit she wore to the Booker ceremony, her curls kept in check by a colourful headscarf. She is interested in power, how those outside the establishment can succeed without abandoning their own identities. “The headline is going to be ‘I want power!’” she hoots, as one not unfamiliar with controversy (the traditionally sleepy RSL has had more than its share ofheadlinesunder her tenure). “What do we mean when we say power?” she says seriously. “Influence, to have an impact, to effect change, to assume leadership positions? It’s so important that power is shared out.” Unlike the late poetBenjamin Zephaniah, who rejected an OBE, Evaristo accepted hers in 2020, arguing that not to do so is to risk enforcing the idea of“white honours for white British people”.Every decade, we are evolving. From my childhood to today, we have evolvedHow does it feel to be at the heart of the establishment, to no longer be “throwing stones at the fortress”, as she puts it in Manifesto? “I still believe in what I believe in. I’m just much more capable and careful, hopefully strategic and able to have more of an impact than I did when I was in my 20s,” she says, reminding me that she has been professor of creative writing at Brunel University for many years now. “You go through an angry period – as you get older you can’t keep that up – but I’m still very alert to the inequality in the world, and also inequality in my industry. I am not there to endorse the status quo. I’m there to bring other people with me and to open the doors, always, to great talent.”She has not just opened doors but built them where none existed. From the moment she graduated from Rose Bruford drama school in 1982 and co-founded theTheatre of Black Womenwith fellow students, the playwrightPatricia Hilaireand directorPaulette Randall,she has set about making things happen. Those early days were not just about creating theatre, she says now, but also work. “Because we were just so unemployable as Black women.” They put on Jackie Kay’s first playChiaroscuroin 1986.Since then, Evaristo has set upprojects,mentoring schemesandprizesfor under-represented poets and novelists. She has run workshops and courses, sat on judging panels (47, by her last count) and boards (“not something I necessarily want to do, trust me!”). Most recently, she launched theBlack Britain: Writing Backseries with her long-term publisher Simon Prosser at Hamish Hamilton, republishing 13 books by writers of colour since 1900. She plans to donate all her “huge” prize money (£100,000) from this latest award to an as yet undisclosed project to support other writers.She hasn’t done all this because she is “saintly. Clearly not!” she laughs. Throughout our conversation, she is at pains not to sound like a “do-gooder”: we are here to talk about her outstanding contribution, I remind her. “If I’m asked to do something, I need to accept the invitation, so that I can make a difference,” she explains. “It is very important for me as a Black, British, working-class, now-older woman to acknowledge that really important position.”The fourth of eight siblings, Evaristo grew up in “an activist household”, she says. Her Nigerian father was a welder who became a local Labour councillor, her mother, a devout Catholic from an Irish family, was a primary school teacher and trade union rep. Evaristo’s childhood in Woolwich, south-east London, in the 1960s was one of racial insults and smashed windows. Her father kept a hammer at the side of the bed for his whole life in England. The young Bernardine developed a “self-protective force field” that persists to this day, along with a determination to fight her corner – with words.After leaving home for drama school at 18, her 20s were spent in a blaze of cigarettes and love affairs – with women – hustling for jobs and moving between the various short-term housing available in the 80s. “I really cherish that period,” she says. She has been straight for 35 years, and today lives with her husband in the outskirts of west London; she has swapped the Marlboro Reds and Drambuie for yoga and meditation.In her 30s, before the boom in creative writing courses, she signed up for a personal development course. “My parents were not part of the elite,” she explains. “So they weren’t going to pass on to me strategies for how to succeed.” Evaristo was manifesting long before Instagram promised us we could live our best lives. The course made her realise “you can change big and you can expect the best. So why not go for that?” she says. She wrote a note to herself that she would win the Booker prize one day. The next three decades were spent working really hard to make it happen. “Nobody was waiting for me to publish books. Nobody was commissioning me,” she has said in aradio interview. “I just wrote on spec and hoped that somebody would publish me.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

Lara, a verse-novel based on her parents’ marriage, came out three years later. Then cameThe Emperor’s Babe, another verse-novel and her first with Penguin, which imagines life for a Black girl in Roman London.Soul Tourists, a zany road trip packed with Black ghosts from white western history;Blonde Roots, a satire that reverses the power dynamics of the slave trade; and a novella called Hello Mum, about a 14-year-old boy growing up on a council estate, followed. All her novels deal with the African diaspora in some way, mixing history, stylistic experimentalism and humour. “I’m always going for the difficult stories and to be subversive,” she says. “I’m always looking to find original ways into what I’m writing about.”Mr Loverman “felt like a taboo subject”. Much has been written about the Windrush generation, but no stories that she knew of told a love story between two elderly Caribbean men. When it was first published, she was told it was“too niche”to be adapted for television, because its protagonist, Barrington Jedidiah Walker, “was Black, old and gay”.While her reputation was steadily building, sales were not. She wouldn’t even look at her royalty statements when they arrived each year. Then, finally, her much-manifested breakthrough came. With Girl, Woman, Other she set out “to explore as many Black women in a single novel as possible”, ranging in age from 19 to 93, all with different backgrounds, faiths, sexualities and classes. Amma, a lesbian playwright, is clearly a version of Evaristo’s younger self. Once again, in a style she calls “fusion fiction”, she plays fast and loose with punctuation in favour of the rhythms of speech and thought. Here are the monologues of the silenced women Evaristo wrote for the theatre all those years ago.Her Booker win coincided with a long-overdue effort to make publishing more inclusive. “George Floyd,” she says, when I ask what she thinks was the catalyst for this change. “There was already an awareness of it, but definitely theGeorge Floyd murderandBlack Lives Matterwas a turning point.” Where once she knew every writer of colour in publishing, and could count them on one hand, she says, today she can’t keep up.“Identity politics has always existed,” she says of today’s culture wars. “We just didn’t name it that.” Last year, she wrote a piece in the Guardian refuting the“false allegations” against the RSLand the rumours that she had swept in with “radical” new measures for appointing fellows, sidelining older, more established names. “It’s a great honour and a privilege,” she says mischievously when I press her for more. “There’s always this argument that if things diversify, standards are dropped.”Evaristo even manages to bring positive thinking to our current global predicament. “Every decade, we are evolving. From my childhood to today, we have evolved,” she says. “We can’t do anything about America, but we can put up a fight in this country.”Of all these achievements, what makes her most proud? “I feel I can enjoy the successes I’ve had of late,” she replies without hesitation, “because I know I haven’t kept it to myself.”Bernardine Evaristo is the winner of the Women’s prize outstanding contribution award.www.womensprize.com.Explore more on these topicsBernardine EvaristoWomen's prize for fictionWomen's prizesAwards and prizesFictionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Home to large pelagic species including whale sharks and scalloped hammerheads, the rugged volcanic peaks were also once the site of an unlikely friendship.It began in December 1988 when Terry Kennedy, a now 83-year-old American sailor with a storied past, met a six-meter-wide giant Pacific manta ray off San Benedicto island’s rugged shore. He would go on to name him Willy. “When I saw him beside the boat, as massive as he was, I just had to get in the water just to see him,” says Kennedy. “I threw a tank on and jumped over, but I didn’t see him anywhere. He couldn’t have vanished that quick. And then I looked straight down and he was coming up underneath me. He was about four feet away and rising so I had no way to get off his back.”Together, on that day and over the next decades, the two rode through the water, with Willy taking Kennedy around the underwater volcanic peaks and as far as two miles, only to always return Kennedy to his boat. Now, 37-years on, their unlikely friendship will be explored in a new documentary called The Last Dive, released on Sunday ahead a series of limited screenings in the US and New Zealand.In it, Kennedy embarks on a final journey to the island in the hope of reuniting with the ray. With its focus on a relationship between man and beast, it will undoubtedly draw parallels to Netflix’s 2020 documentary The Octopus Teacher, which told the moving story of how Craig Foster came to know an octopus.View image in fullscreenTerry and his wife, Dawn, greet the sunrise before the last dive.Photograph: Chance FalknerFilm-maker Cody Sheehy hopes that showing the film will “inspire a whole new generation” to fall in love with the ocean. “For me, it’s personal,” he says. “I live with my wife and two-year-old son on a sailboat. Every night, I drift off to sleep with the sound of the ocean slapping our hull. Over the last 20-plus years, I have watched life in the ocean disappear.”When Kennedy and Willy met, very few divers understood theharmful impactsthat could come with touching a wild animal – a practice that has beenbannedgloballyacross federally protected marine areas and dive sites. Harmful impacts from physical touchincludesignificant stress and behavioral changes across mantas.Yet, at the time, Willy, with his four distinctive black dots in the shape of a diamond on his right shoulder, and Kennedy, formed an inexplicable bond of trust and respect that Kennedy documented with his video camera. Coming up to Kennedy’s boat and slapping his fin against the hull, Willy would wait for Kennedy to climb on his back before taking off for a ride around the island.On multiple occasions, Willy helped Kennedy locate abandoned nets. “He drove me crazy one day trying to get my attention,” says Kennedy. “Finally, I moved off from the other two divers, got on his back, and he took me off and we run on down. Next thing I knew, I see the bottom coming up, and there’s this giant net, far bigger than anything I’ve ever seen before.“I realized early on, he took me to the full perimeter of the net. He was purposely showing me what was there, how big it was,” Kennedy says. He went on to contact the Mexican navy and in two days, Kennedy, alongside a large gunship and navy divers, pulled up 17,050 meters of net.View image in fullscreenA dive boat lies at anchor at Punta Tosca on Socorro island during a tour around the Revillagigedo Islands archipelago in 2024.Photograph: Alfredo Martinez/Getty ImagesAnother time, Willy positioned himself between Kennedy and a great hammerhead shark during one of Kennedy’s dives.“He turned around and came up in front of me and was kind of dogging me, back and forth. I thought he wanted to go for a ride but I’d break to the right, he’d break to the right. I couldn’t understand what was going on with him. Finally I did a jig and jog and I looked around and there was an 18ft great hammer,” Kennedy says in The Last Dive.“I thought to myself, ‘Whoa. Willy protected me,’” he adds.With the largest brain-to-body-mass ratio compared with other fish, mantas are highly intelligent creatures. As curious filter feeders, mantas canrecognizethemselves in a mirror, demonstrating a rare sign of self-awarenesscomparable onlyto a few animals including primates, elephants and dolphins.Yet these docile creatures are listed asthreatenedunder the US Endangered Species Act, with thousandsbeing targeted and killedeach year for the trade in their delicate feeding gills or merely caught as bycatch across legal and illegal fisheries.View image in fullscreenA manta ray caught in gill net at Huatampo on Mexico’s Sea of Cortez.Photograph: Nature Picture Library/AlamyKennedy’s friendship with Willy changed not only his approach to wildlife underwater but also pushed Kennedy, then a big game fish hunter, into his unlikely role of conservationist.In 1994, Kennedy captured on camera theslaughter of multiple mantason Valentine’s Day at San Benedicto island – including ones that swam with Kennedy the day before. After the incident, which prompted international outcry, Kennedy became a vocal proponent of federal fishing regulations, successfully pushing the Mexican governmentto declareRevillagigedo Archipelago a nationally protected marine reserve.“What happened out in San Benedicto, I just pretty much said, ‘That’s enough for me.’ I’d rather shoot them with a camera and from that day forward, I got along with the big fish that would actually come close to me. I don’t know what it is when they no longer felt any fear of me,” he says.Kennedy’s relationship with the ocean has evolved over the years. The self-confessed “troubled kid” growing up in California started diving at 12 years old – his first dive being a 200ft dive on his own. He served in the US navy in Vietnam and later was a Hells Angel biker, a bar owner and a wild sailor living onboard his boat – once named Erotica – on the Pacific.But as his relationship with the rays deepened, he found he was his truest self under the water. For Kennedy, who has done more than 14,000 dives: “My world starts when I go below the surface.” Since meeting Willy, that world has become one he and his ocean collaborators are dedicated to preserving.View image in fullscreenTerry Kennedy diving.Photograph: Johnny FridayAmid aglobal declinein mantas and rise in poorly regulateddive boatsleaving them frequentlyinjuredand their fragile ecosystems disturbed, the need to protect mantas is more urgent than ever. “There are so many dive boats out there that if we don’t dive responsibly with them, it might affect how they [the rays] feed underwater,” says Sheehy.Sheehy, who dived with Kennedy in the archipelago, also points to boat traffic, saying: “The mantas want to come up to the top, they’re hard to see and they’re getting hit by boats. And I think that is the real pressure that tourism is bringing that we need to talk about.”The urgency for increased marine regulations also comes as Donald Trump’s administration sets a dangerous example to other countries to disregard environmental protections. The US’s latestenvironmental rollbacksfromcommercial fishing proclamationstodelisting certain animalsas endangered species threaten the overall wellbeing of marine wildlife.Though rare, the bond between Kennedy and Willy offers a profound glimpse at a shared bond that is possible when such creatures are given the chance to live and thrive.“Willy showed me what needed to be done, and I’ve just done it,” Kennedy says.Explore more on these topicsMarine lifeSeascape: the state of our oceansFishDocumentary filmsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

His lucid message here is “If we save the sea we save our world”, as he talks us through what humanity has done to the Earth’s oceans and how we can protect them. Awe and anger intermingle – there are glorious images of aquatic life, such as the remote submarine seamounts that are “pitstops” for migrating fish or the kelp forests in coastal waters that capture carbon. But it’s the underwater footage of indiscriminate dredging by trawlers that has the most emotional impact – a picture of devastation that’s also a call to arms.Simon WardellJulius Caesar (Joseph L.

And Brando has to raise his game, what with seasoned stage stars James Mason (Brutus), Louis Calhern (Caesar) and, particularly, John Gielgud (Cassius) immersing us eloquently in portents and plots, murder and mayhem.SWLive sportMen’s International T20 Cricket: England v West Indies, 2pm, Channel 5The second match from Bristol.Men’s International Football: FA Nations League Final, 7.30pm, ITV1Portugal take on Spain at Allianz Arena, Munich.Explore more on these topicsTelevision & radioTV tonightfeaturesShareReuse this content"

An encore occurs because the audience wants more.” Since their initial breakup in 2002, Pulp have re-formed twice, for sold-out tours and festival sets played to loyal, rapturous audiences. Tonight, the stakes are higher: for the first time in 24 years,Pulp have a new album, More, released just one day before tonight’s opening show. The audience want more – but do they want More?Pulp: More review – anthems and rage for the next life stageRead moreAny anxiety about new material is quashed when set opener and comeback single Spike Island is received like an old friend. Jarvis Cocker rises from the back of the stage flanked by cardboard cutouts of his bandmates – recognisable from the cover of 1995’s Different Class – before joining their real-life counterparts, guitarist Mark Webber, drummer Nick Banks and keyboardist Candida Doyle, downstage. Continuing this mood, old and new songs on the setlist complement each other: the spacious psychedelia of More’s Farmer’s Market leads into the wide-eyed wonder of Sunrise from We Love Life; and the high stakes disco of O.U. (Gone, Gone) is echoed in its new counterpart Got to Have Love. With its illuminated staircase, kitschy backdrops and full string section, the stage is reminiscent of a 1970s chatshow set, with Cocker holding court in a corduroy suit, taking a seat – and occasionally laying down – during the spoken word sections, but always captivating.View image in fullscreenLuxe melodrama … Jarvis Cocker with Pulp at OVO Hydro.Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The GuardianThe setlist caters for fans of most Pulp eras, but This Is Hardcore heads are truly spoiled, with Help the Aged and The Fear both played live for the first time in over a decade. The latter sees Cocker share the limelight with four inflatable air dancers, somehow perfectly encapsulating the song’s ennui in their gigantic absurdity. This Is Hardcore begins with the strings-only End of the Line mix, maximising the luxe melodrama before laying on its heavy dread. A hits-packed final run ends with Common People, somehow still thrilling – and relevant – 30 years after its release. The curtains are drawn, but the band return for a semi-acoustic version of A Sunset, the final track from More. It says a lot about this beloved group that, after playing their biggest hit, they can play an album track released yesterday to the same rapt attention.Pulp tour the UK and Ireland until 21 JuneExplore more on these topicsMusicPop and rockreviewsShareReuse this content"

Acid-tongued Myrtle spends her days in her overgrown yard with her husband, Melrose, grandson, Rudy, and Rudy’s “close friend” Jason. But around the patch of grass, memories seep into the present through ghosts and flickering flashes, in a jumble of certainty and doubt.That’s because, at 82, Myrtle has begun to lose her grip on reality.Taio Lawson’s inaugural production as the Bush theatre’s incoming artistic director is a full immersion into this disorienting, fragile mindscape. One moment, a scene unfolds as a naturalistic conversation; the next, the auditorium is plunged into pitch darkness, pierced by an eerie, rumbling soundscape. It’s a striking way for Lawson to make a creative entrance; but with so much happening onstage, the production tips into becoming overblown and chaotic.View image in fullscreenShame on his shoulders … Michael Ahomka-Lindsay as Rudy (front) and Elander Moore as Jason in Miss Myrtle's Garden at Bush theatre.Photograph: Camilla GreenwellAt its centre is a tour-de-force performance by Diveen Henry as Miss Myrtle. Her sardonic put-downs (“being difficult is better than being easy”) paint her as a pillar of blunt-force resilience. Her sharp quips are crisply drawn, showing King’s gift for writing rich comedy. But as the scenes roll forward, it becomes heartbreakingly clear that Myrtle’s memory is faltering and she needs help.Rudy faces a complicated future: what to do with Myrtle, and how to extract the information she guards about his dead father before time runs out. But Rudy also is keeping a secret of his own: Jason is actually his partner. Shame about who he is presses heavily on Rudy’s shoulders. Their chemistry, wonderfully encapsulated by the gentle, side-glancing performances of Michael Ahomka-Lindsay as Rudy and Elander Moore as Jason, is left to play out in the shadows. When both men move into Myrtle’s house, the weight of their unspoken love only deepens.Designer Khadija Raza builds a neat circle of grass, decorated with real flowers and soil for the action to play out on. Here, Rudy battles Myrtle for shards of the past while willing her not to vanish into the depths of dementia. Even as the script meanders, their relationship is charged with unspoken pain, sure to pull at your heartstrings.At Bush theatre until 12 JulyExplore more on these topicsStageBush theatreTheatreDementiareviewsShareReuse this content"

The stable courtyard at Nevill Holt wasconverted into a comfortable 400-seat opera houseseven years ago, and now this year’s festival also offers the first fruits of a tie-up with Leeds-based Opera North, who will take a new production south for the coming five years.This summer’s Così Fan Tutte offers alternating casts under the assured and energised conducting of Chris Hopkins. But it is not in every respect a wholly new production. Cecilia Stinton’s direction and George Leigh’s designs provide a specially created version of Mozart’s opera for the Nevill Holt residency. Yet there remain traces, notably in the costumes, ofthe Tim Albery productionthat did sterling work for Opera North from 2009. Perhaps it is best to think of this as a country house remix of Albery’s Cosi.Another survival is that this version is in English. This brings terrific immediacy, even for those who can follow Lorenzo Da Ponte’s punning Italian original. The programme gives no single writer the credit, but it is a witty and succinct translation that adds to the overall fun and pace. “One man is as good as another; and they are all good for nothing,” sings Dorabella, as she and her sister Fiordiligi debate how to deal with their respective suitors.View image in fullscreenVery much the puppet-master … Will Dazeley as Don Alfonso and Claire Lees as Despina in Così Fan Tutte at the Nevill Holt festival.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianStinton places the cynical philosopher Don Alfonso at the centre of things. This Alfonso is not simply trying to prove his misogynistic point about women’s affections. He is trying to prove it inside an opera-within-an-opera version of Così that he is himself writing and directing. Confused? It sometimes gets that way. But it is a device that offers plenty of opportunities for stage farce, as well as adding fresh layers of transgressive ambiguity to an opera that is already full of them.Vocally, all six principals make a mark. Seán Boylan’s stylish Guglielmo and Egor Zhuravskii’s ardently sung Ferrando are a well-matched pair of officers turned increasingly troubled pawns in Alfonso’s game. Among the women, Ella Taylor’s Fiordiligi is particularly fine in their two formidable arias and for their ability to command expressive softness as well as strength. Heather Lowe’s Dorabella is bright voiced and engagingly acted. Claire Lees knows all the ropes as Despina and has little difficulty stealing the show when she needs to do so.It helps most of all, though, that William Dazeley is such a well acted and sung Alfonso. Mozart may have denied Alfonso the chance to shine in an aria of his own, but he is very much the puppet-master. Or at least in this version he is until the final moments, when his traumatised charges finally revolt against his loveless philosophy and chase him from the stage.Nevill Holt festival continues until 22 JuneThis article was amended on 8 June 2025 to reflect the fact that Ella Taylor’s preferred pronouns are they/them.Explore more on these topicsOperaClassical musiclive music reviewsShareReuse this content"

She covered an eclectic range of subjects, from the importance and vitality of Kernewek (Cornish) to rebellions of the 15th and 16th centuries – and cheese.Gwenno, whose parents are a Cornish poet and Welsh language activist, sings in Cornish, Welsh and English. She said: “The children in Mevagissey weren’t that familiar with the language because they don’t have access to it. I think it would be really useful for it to be on the curriculum. It’s really nourishing for children to learn about local heritage and history in a language that is from the place where they live.“It’s so easy in a very globalised world to feel like everything’s the same and there’s only one way of doing things. Having local strains of history and language and accents gives you a sense of place and sense of community and creativity.”Gwenno was nominated for the Mercury prize in 2022 forher acclaimed third record, the Cornish-language Tresor. She is appearing at theHeligan Homecoming festivalon Thursday 19 June as part of a lineup of artists, comedians and thinkers exploring the themes of home and belonging. She last performed a gig in Cornwall at theMinack theatrein 2023.Among the songs Gwenno performed for the children in Mevagissey was Den Heb Taves, meaning “a tongueless man”. Gwenno said: “It’s about losing your language and how that contributes towards losing your grounding and your footing.”She also spoke to the children of the Cornish rebellion of 1497, partly a response to hardship caused by the raising of taxes by Henry VII to go to war, and the Prayer Book Rebellion of 1549.“Children love those sorts of really deep, dark, big ideas,” Gwenno said. “I think that when you go into school and you’re having a conversation it’s really important to try and push it emotionally and intellectually.“Often people think: ‘Oh well, we’ve lost our language because it wasn’t important or it was irrelevant’ and actually, so often it’s systematic and it’s structural why a language dies or almost dies.”She said she wanted to convey to the children that Cornish was an integral part of her life. “The language is something that’s part of my life and part of my home life and I think if a language comes from that I think it has a real chance to thrive.”Cornwall council believes there are about 500 advanced Cornish speakers and 2,000 with basic levels of Cornish. It has designed a free initiative called Go Cornish for Primary Schools to promote the language and culture.It says Cornish culture is “thriving” with more peoplegetting involved with programmesand events celebrating Cornish food, heritage, sports and music.Gwenno also sang a rousing song with the Mevagissey children about cheese called Eus Keus? (Is There Cheese?). “I thought we should probably lighten it. The thing about any language or culture is that you’ve got to find the absurd in it and the humour. It’s really cathartic to shout about cheese. It was fun to do. I’ll be singing that till I’m 90 if I’m still here.”The Heligan Homecoming festival takes place on selected dates between 13 and 22 June 13.

Before the United Nations Ocean Conference, Blue Marine Foundation, Only One and Oceana UK are calling on the UK government to impose an immediate ban on bottom trawling in all UK marine-protected areas.Directed by the twice-Bafta nominated director Ben Mallaby, the film “exposes the brutal truth aboutone of the most destructive and overlooked fishing practicestaking place in British marine reserves”, according to the charity.Despite their designation, most UK marine protected areas (MPAs) still allow bottom trawling. The process decimates habitats and indiscriminately catches and kills countless “non-target” marine species in the process.Research by Blue Marine shows that 74% of England’s inshore MPAs and 92% in Scotland still permit this practice, including in fragile habitats such as seagrass meadows.In the film, James plays a diner at a smart restaurant who orders a seemingly sustainable fish course. But his evening takes a horrifying turn when an enormous net of rotting by-catch and oil is dumped on him and his table as the “extras” to his plaice.Fry plays a comedic, shadowy waiter, who reminds James that what we don’t see on the menu is often the most devastating to marine environments. Both men are Blue Marine ambassadors.‘You can’t always win in this industry’: Theo JamesRead more“This shockingly destructive practice continues even in the UK’s protected areas,” Fry said. “I witnessed the waste first-hand and was absolutely appalled. It is morally corrupt to allow what should be thriving ecological wildernesses to be reduced to shells of destruction. Bottom trawling in marine protected areas must be banned now.”James added: “As a keen diver I’ve long been captivated by the ocean and been horrified by the impact humans are having on it. Having had a load of bycatch dumped on me, it really drove home just how grotesque and devastating the practice of bottom trawling is.”The film comes asan influential group of UK MPs have also called for ministers to ban bottom trawlingin marine-protected areas.Campaigners have been calling for years for a ban, but public outcry has intensified sincea film by Sir David Attenborough was released last month, to coincide with his 99th birthday.Toby Perkins, the chair of the environmental audit Commons committee, said: “Ministers must ensure that marine protected areas live up to their name. [They] have all the information they need to press ahead with banning bottom trawling in the offshore protected areas where it presents the most risk. Why the delay? Our oceans cannot afford any more prevarication. It is time to act.”Explore more on these topicsOceansStephen FryMarine lifeFishingAnimalsConservationFoodnewsShareReuse this content"

Often given as a wedding present, these vases were usually passed down as family heirlooms, revealing the accessibility of art deco works, she says, gesturing to the glass cabinet beside her. “If you were a collector, you could find works that cost a fortune, but these pieces were destined for people of more modest means for very reasonable prices.”Art deco was the first artistic movement that sought to appeal to a wider public beyond the elites, say the organisers of a new exhibition dedicated to the artistic movement of the interwar years, co-curated by Dubois, the president of the Brussels Art Deco Society.The exhibition, which opened this month at the BELvue museum in Brussels, brings together for the first time works owned by the King Baudouin Foundation, which was founded through a donation from the late Belgian monarch in 1976. It is part of the Belgian capital’s year-long celebration of art deco – events and exhibitions torecognise and market Brusselsas a centre for the artistic movement known for its geometric designs, exotic motifs and opulent materials.View image in fullscreenTête de Femme by Oscar Jespers.Photograph: Benjamin De Vuyst/Galerie De VuystThrough this modest exhibition of sculptures, vases, furniture and everyday artworks, the museum aims to chart the evolution of art deco: from luxurious hand-crafted goods for the few, to mass-produced objects aimed at middle-class consumers around the world. “It’s the first style that spread in all layers of society, from the richest to the poor people,” says Werner Adriaenssens, another co-curator and an art history professor at the Free University of Brussels.During the interwar years, brightly coloured geometric-patterned ceramic tiles were exported from Belgium’s industrial heartlands all around the world. Ships left the port of Antwerp laden with tiles destined for kitchens, bathrooms and shops.Art deco was the first global style. From Paris, often credited as the birthplace of the movement, it spread to New York, Soviet Moscow, Shanghai, Beirut and Brussels.Many of the “wedding gift” vases were designed in the southern Belgium town of La Louvière by the Franco-Belgian artist Charles Catteau, who oversaw production of decorative ceramics at Boch Frères during the interwar years. The company was a Belgian offshoot of the Franco-Luxembourgish ceramics dynasty, founded 14 years after the Belgian revolution of 1830. By 1935 it employed 1,350 people. Catteau did not design all the pieces but supervised the models, colours and finish of the glazes. His signature was stamped on every piece, a kind of trademark.As art met commerce, governments realised the creative sector had economic weight. Economic considerations led Belgium’s government to participate in the International Exhibition of Modern Decorative and Industrial Arts in Paris in 1925, a show seen as the founding moment of the art deco movement, although almost no one used that term until decades later. “The only reason to participate for Belgium in 25 was that the government was convinced that the decorative hearts had an economic impact,” Adriaenssens said.View image in fullscreenPerle Fine by Oscar Jespers.Photograph: De VuystThat Paris exhibition in 1925 heralded a shift from art nouveau of the prewar years, especially in the depiction of women. No longer the dreamy feminine ideal of art nouveau, women in art deco were often elegant, stylised and powerful. Emblematic of the shift is a 1925 sculpture by the Flemish artist Oscar Jespers: influenced by cubism, the workFine Pearlshows a female face that is abstract, modern, ghost-like.Catteau’s vases reflect cubist influences, as well as a fascination with exotic birds and animals, probably inspired bythe Belgian Congo. According to Adriaenssens, art deco artists were the first to do market research. “They were really searching, what does the middle class want?” So they did not shy away from older themes, such as ancient Greek-inspired pottery, but with modern geometric shapes and glazes.Art nouveau, as the name implies, wanted to be new, Adriaenssens observed. “Art deco has not that aspiration to be completely new, but to be modern.”Explore more on these topicsArt and designCeramicsBelgiumEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

(Because when you can’t control the big stuff, start small)Experts, Guardian readers and writers share ingenious solutions to life’s everyday irritations, from wobbly tables to persistent hiccupsCompiled bySarah PhillipsSun 8 Jun 2025 01.00 EDTShareHouseholdStuffed-up sievesAlways use a dishwasher. If one isn’t available, soak in the sink first, to loosen particles, then take a dish brush or nail brush to it. Rinse under a fast hot tap.Aggie MacKenzie, TV presenter and authorCoffeethat clogsCoffee brewed with a French press leaves behind a slurry of grounds and water, and usually too much liquid for the kitchen bin. But coffee grounds can clog up plumbing and create major problems, which I learned the hard way. I now place a single paper towel over the sink waste and filter the grounds until they are dry enough for the trash.Brandon Wilks, Fairbanks,AlaskaDodgy dishwashersIf your dishwasher is not working well, it could be down to a simple blockage: something small enough to pass through the filter, but large enough to clog the spray arm holes from the inside. In my experience it’s either lemon pips or pine nuts. The two spray arms (some posh dishwashers have three) are easy to remove; shake over the sink, the pine nuts will dislodge and your dishwasher will clean like new again.Tim Dowling, Saturday columnistToo much TupperwareEveryone has way too many plastic storage containers, and half don’t have a lid, are stained or bubbled. Scale it back. Unfortunately, Tupperware isn’t accepted by local household recycling services but you can tryTerraCycle, donate to charity or repurpose, such as into tubs for planting seeds.If you still have quite a few, use a CD rack for the lids.Abi Macdonald,professional organiser, NorwichGlasseshalf-full or emptyI get annoyed with half-full glasses of water around the house, especially as we’re on a meter. I make myself feel better by pouring them into a little watering can, for when I need to do the plants. Also, keep a bottle of water in the fridge so you don’t have to run the mixer tap to get cold water after using hot.Hilary Osborne, Guardian money & consumer editorWobbly tablesI find it annoying when tables wobble. Despite all of our modern technology, we have not fixed this. My solution is to carry with me a small wooden wedge.Chris Haji-Michael, AustriaManky clothsI hate wiping up crumbs with a damp cloth – that is gross. So I have a small dustpan and brush used only for the kitchen side and tables. I can’t live without it. I even run it through the dishwasher to freshen it up.Victoria Cozens, EssexPreserving paintbrushesTo get the paint out of the paintbrush ferrule (where the bristles are fixed, and buildup ruins the brush), I use a cat comb. Brushes last longer and stay flexible.Diana Howard, Aix-en-Provence, FranceThe wonder tapeI have recently discovered the novelty of double-sided nano tape. It has lots of uses, including tacking random things to the wall, from pictures and shower gel to a bread knife or small scissors. It can stop mats slipping. It could hold things down on boats, perhaps. I like thinking of ways to use it next.Lindsey Wilson, NorwichSticky label marksStubborn stickers? Warm with a hairdryer for a few seconds to soften the glue, then peel off smoothly.Mimi Glenn, WarwickshireLazy curtainsIf you have those corded curtain tracks, you’ll find they become sluggish over time – because you haven’t lubricated them since they were installed. Never use WD-40. Just take an old clean rag, liberally saturate with cheap furniture polish, then wipe the track with it, leave to dry – and you’ll find they glide.Charlie Holding,LondonKids’tat gone wildKids attract endlessly annoying knick-knacks, so I’ve bought two clear over-door hangers for my daughter, which are meant for shoes, and put them inside her wardrobe door so they don’t make her room look messy. Also good is to have a box for each person in the house, kept in their bedroom, and when they leave random bits lying around, put them in there.Abi MRecycling runneth overIt is possible to fold most empty soft plastic packaging into a triangle shape with little effort. This saves space and prevents any remnants leaking out. I do it all the time – if I’m out, it means I can take my rubbish home without making a mess in my bag/pockets.Ollie Williams, BerlinFood and drinkYou v onionsPutting a teaspoon in your mouth seems to help with onion tears. But best of all is wearing contact lenses – not possible for everyone but a bonus if you use them.Georgina Hayden, Feast columnistHalf-edible asparagusI used to get frustrated with asparagus – one end takes longer to cook than the other. Perfectly cooked tips result in raw stalks; tender stalks yield mushy tips. The solution was both lazy and stupidly obvious: I leave on the rubber band the spears come bundled with, so they can stand upright, shoulder deep, in the simmering water for a few minutes; long enough to cook the stalks. Then I reach in with scissors and snip the band, so they fall over and the tips cook. If your asparagus doesn’t come with a rubber band – or if you want to avoid microplastics–tie with butcher’s string to get the same result. After I invented this, it occurred to me that maybe everyone already does this – maybe that’s what the rubber band isfor. Still, it’s changed my life for the better.TDMango messStand it upright and cut into two cheeks, using the stone as a guide. Then do the hedgehog trick, scoring the flesh in a crisscross section. When you flip it inside out, there are chunks of mango to cut off.GHUnopenable jarsSome people say pierce the lid with a knife but I think that is a recipe for disaster. If you tap the edge of the lid on a hard worktop to release the air pressure, it opens straight away.GHNo ice cube tray, no problemFreezing fruit is a way of keeping drinks super cold in the summer and looks pretty. Just put grapes in the freezer, on a baking sheet. When they have frozen, put them in a tub so you don’t waste so much space. Or, as a friend’s mum used to, freeze slices of lemon and lime for gin and tonics.GHGarlicky fingersI love garlic but the smell on my hands after peeling and chopping it was a big put-off. A transformational life hack was discovering rubbing and washing your hands with stainless steel after cutting garlic almost completely removes the smell. You can even buy a bar of stainless steel that looks like soap and does the trick.Tenzing Sonam, IndiaLeftoverbits and piecesI have a sandwich bag in my fridge of all the odds and ends of cheese; they keep for ages. I would always freeze feta, though, as it doesn’t last long. Likewise, keep any last little bits of carrot, onion or other veg in a bag and next time you are making a ragu or soup, chuck them in. If you buy a pot of cream for a recipe and use only a small amount, freeze the rest in an ice cube tray. Do the same with wine.GHEggshelleverywhereI always crack eggs on a worktop or chopping board.Just a tap to break the shell will make sure it doesn’t go everywhere. If you do it on the edge of a bowl or pan, you push shards of eggshell into the egg. Likewise if you use a knife you are more likely to get tiny bits of shell in your food. If you do get shell in the egg and try to use your fingers to pick out any fragments, it is absolutely impossible. If you use the rest of the shell, you will get it every time.GHView image in fullscreenPhotograph; Ilka and Franz. Clothes:Reserved. Ring:Kurt Geiger. Bracelet:Anisa SojkaEggs that are hard to peelI’ve found that placing the eggs directly into already boiling water, then transferring them immediately to cold water once they are cooked makes peeling much easier. I presume the thermal shock facilitates the separation of egg from shell. I really cannot bear to see people starting the eggs in a pan of cold water.Nicolas Magand, StrasbourgWasted honeyI find it really frustrating when measuring honey for a recipe, because you will always end up leaving honey on the tablespoon, so it’s not an accurate measure. But if you brush the spoon with a little bit of oil first, the honey will glide straight off.GHThe faff of peeling gingerPeel root ginger with a teaspoon. It’s unbeatable for getting into all the nooks and crannies.AnonymousGardenLost toolsFor some reason, most of the tools available are designed in earthy colours, so the minute you drop your trowel on the ground it becomes impossible to find, especially if you wander away and come back. I have taken to putting a ring of neon tape round the handle, so it is immediately obvious where a tool is.Claire Ratinon, Saturday gardening columnistSquirrels obsessed with your bulbsThis is deeply annoying. You plant all these bulbs, they cost lots of money, and then the squirrels dig them out. Some people try the cayenne pepper trick – putting it all over the soil after you have planted bulbs – but it is arduous and not very kind to the squirrels. The main way to get rid of them is with chicken wire over the pots. But an easy hack is to get the clear plastic lid of a storage crate and whack it on top with heavy stones. Put that on your pots and squirrels can’t get into it but the sunshine can.Alice Vincent, Saturday gardening columnistVery muddy bootsThe mud these last few winters has been so infuriating that my partner has made a welly puller. It is a plank of wood with a triangle cut out of it that you can put your heel into, mounted on a smaller piece of wood at a 30 degree angle off the ground. You have to use it properly or it gets covered in mud and doesn’t save your socks from getting covered, too. Take your first boot off using the toe of the second boot, then use the welly puller to take off that one. If you are not particularly handy with wood and nails, put a trug with a few inches of water in it at the back door. Stand in it and swish the mud off.CRProductivityForgotten things on your to-do listI’m a big fan of the principle of “universal capture”, which is productivity geek speak for always having ready access to somewhere you can scribble something down when you think of it, in a way that you’ll then see it later, so as to take action on it if necessary. The unfortunately namedBraintosslets me email a note to myself with two clicks, rather than going through my email app, and as I know I’ll check my email, I’m sure to encounter the reminder. Whenever I travel, I carry a plastic pouch that closes with a zip, so I can throw receipts, random papers, bits of currency, etc in there. All of this is really just a way of respecting the fact that the human brain is far too limited to serve as a useful repository for endless task lists.Oliver Burkeman, author ofMeditations for MortalsInterruptionsOne idea I’ve found useful for dealing with irritating interruptions when you’re trying to concentrate is: be careful not to define more things than necessary as “interruptions”. If you’re the kind of person who tries to schedule your whole day very strictly, you’re pretty much asking to feel annoyed when reality collides with your rigid plan. If you have autonomy over your schedule, a better idea is to try to safeguard three or four hours at most for total focus – this is, it turns out, the maximum countless authors, scientists and artists have managed in an uninterrupted fashion anyway. If I’m working at home on a day when it’s not my turn for school pickup, and my son bursts in to tell me excitedly about something he’s done, it’s a shame if I feel annoyed by the intrusion rather than delighted by the serendipitous interaction, solely because I’ve defined that period as time for deep focus.OBA stranger at the doorI discovered this by accident, but unsolicited door-knockers are eager to conclude their business and go away if you open the door while holding some kind of large electric gardening implement. I just happened to be carrying a hedge trimmer when the bell rang, but a chainsaw would be even better. You could leave it on a hook by the door.TDView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Ilka & Franz. Clothes:Mango. Charm bracelet and earrings:Anatina. Chain bracelet:Rachel Jackson. Necklaces:Anisa SojkaandMissomaRandom keys in the kitchen drawerYou know that box of old keys you see every day and don’t have a clue what they’re for? Take time to go through them, trying them out in various places. Soon you will know they are of no use to you. Chuck the lot. I did that a few years ago and all was fine.AggieMPaperwork mountainsWe have a “deal with them once” rule. As soon as it comes through the letterbox, any junk gets put straight in the recycling, rather than put away or allowed to clutter up surfaces, because that means you end up dealing with it at least twice, picking it up and moving it around. Instead, open your mail when it comes in, get rid of the envelope straight away, then have a paperwork system, so you’ve got sections for action required, pending or needs putting away, and teach everyone to follow suit.AbiMFashion and beautyFoundationsmudgesYou have done your makeup; now you want to put on a pale top without getting a tidemark on the neck. Simple: turn it around, put it over your head back to front, then scooch it round the right way before you put your arms in the sleeves. A tiny bit of foundation at your nape is way less visible than under your face.Jess Cartner-Morley, Guardianfashion editorTangly washingTo avoid this, put cords in a tote bag, tie it and wash. For hoodie strings, tie them in a bow around the neck, then put the whole thing in the tote bag to wash.Morwenna Ferrier, Guardianfashion& lifestyle editorCrumpled clothes on arrivalEver made pinwheel pastries? That’s the trick here, but with clothes. Lay tops on top of each other, fold sleeves diagonally across, then – as carefully and tightly as if rolling pastry – roll together, from neck down, so you end up with a swiss roll of fabric. Do the same with trousers or dresses. Place in your case and fill the gaps with PJs, denim shorts, socks, things that don’t have crease issues. It takes longer than chucking everything in but works like a charm and saves space.JCMOdd socksI solved this by throwing out all my socks and buying only black ones. They end up not matching anyway because they fade at different rates, have different size bands at the top, etc, but it’s better than it could be.Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett, Guardian columnistView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Ilka & Franz. Socks:Happy Socks. Shoes:New Look. Skirt:ReservedShoes that rubThey felt fine in the changing room but now you’ve got a blister coming on? With leather shoes, you can fix this with a hairdryer. (Check they are leather: most “vegan leather” is plastic, which will melt.) Dampen the leather with a wet cloth, then point a hairdryer at the problem area until you feel the leather warm and soften. Put on thick socks and go for a walk.JCMPeople ‘borrowing’ your tightsIf more than one person in your house wears tights, they never end up in your possession. The only way round this is by enforcing rigid brand allegiance, so you know if they’re from M&S, they’re definitely yours.Zoe Williams, Guardian columnistMascara splodgesIf you splodge mascara on your face, don’t panic! Wait a minute or two for it to dry, then brush away using a clean spoolie or an eyebrow pencil’s brush. It will easily come off without disturbing your makeup.Jaz Crush, makeup artist, London100 ways to slightly improve your life without really tryingRead moreThat last tiny bit of nail polishCut old tights into small pieces and use to remove nail polish. The nylon’s slightly abrasive quality makes the polish come off faster than with a cotton ball.Francesca Fortunato, New YorkCrinkled clothingI never iron clothes. I just shake them really well when I take them out of the machine, hang out, then fold neatly. If an item needs ironing, I won’t buy it.AbiMTangled jewelleryIf you want to wear multiple necklaces but avoid tangling, you need amagnetic clasp– attach each necklace to its own connector andvoilà.Chloe Mac Donnell, Guardian deputy fashion& lifestyle editorStinky foam slippersFreeze them, wash on a gentle cycle, then air.Lee Setili, Georgia, USBobbleson tightsWrap parcel tape round your hand and go over the garment as you would with a lint roller.Aggie MFrizzyhairSleeping on a satin pillowcase stops you getting so hot: it repels sweat and keeps moisture in your hair. Also, a microfibre towel is gentler on your hair’s cuticles.Michelle Druy, hairdresser, SurreyHealthThe unavoidable running blistersSooner or later, if you are running you will get a big bastard blister on your heel, and there is no point using anything other than one of those expensive padded blister plasters. Normal plasters won’t get you home without pain, or let you run again next day.Phil Daoust, GuardianFit for evercolumnistHiccupsI have a guaranteed cure. 1 Take a deep breath and pinch your nose. 2 With nose pinched, try to expel air through it, to the point where your ears almost pop. 3 Maintaining the ears-about-to-pop sensation, sip and swallow cool water from a glass or cup. This technique has never let me down. I believe it works by forcing your brain to concentrate on other small motor actions, thereby forgetting about the hiccups.David Daniel, ShanghaiView image in fullscreenPhotography throughout: Ilka & Franz, assisted by Pablo Bueno.

Necklace:XUXAStubbed toesWhen someone has a minor injury, such as stubbing their toe, give them a full minute to themselves so they can enter, then exit, their “bubble of pain”. This is what we do in our family and I swear it helps get rid of pain much faster. We don’t ask, “What happened?” or, “Are you OK?” until the injured person speaks first. A hand on their shoulder or a respectful bowing of the head to the Gods of Minor Pain is sufficient at this time.AnonymousTechnologyFace ID failsBring your iPhone to eye level and be sure your face is square on to the top of the screen, your eyes are open and the phone isn’t facing into direct sun. Still having problems? Try redoing your scan in the face ID settings, enable mask mode or set up an alternative appearance – helpful if you sometimes wear glasses.Samuel Gibbs, Guardian consumer technology editorPhone storage woesDeleting unused apps and games, storing photos and videos in the cloud, and clearing unwanted offline music and films can quickly free up space, but don’t overlook WhatsApp and other messaging apps. Every picture, gif and meme sent or received eats up space, so regularly clearing out messaging storage can save you gigabytes of memory.

I built up a sizeable network of online friends during and after the pandemic,but I’ve found myself craving real-life friends to interact with more often.Idon’t drink and I’m struggling to find activities for people my age that I’m interested in. Apart from a fewat my job, I haven’t been able to make any new friends, and my contact with old school friends has become less and less frequent.I’m struggling to find a solution.I’ve tried friend-finding and dating apps,but have had almost noresponses and I’m getting demoralised. How do you make friends in a situation like this?Your early 20s can be a strange time for friendships. People leave formal education, start jobs and start or end significant relationships. It’s a time of flux, when you feel your whole life is ahead of you, yet also like it’s never going to start. There’s a lot of jostling for position and how to define yourself.Increasingly, I’m getting letters like yours from early twentysomethings, so you’re not alone. An online life has its place, but we are social animals and need social interaction. I went to the UK Council for Psychotherapy-registered therapist Jason Maldonado-Page, who remembers “feeling the same way as you do when I moved to London in my mid-20s”, adding that it’s a theme that comes up a lot in his clinical work as cities can be lonely places. He reiterates that your 20s can be a time of great change, and things like “new careers, intimate relationships and, for some, the birth of a child can take time and focus, and can be a hindrance to making and sustaining friendships. For many of us, friendships are not like on TV, where people live nearby and pop in unannounced.” It’s important to remember: in a world obsessed with portraying the ideal or the terrible, expectations must be realistic.People presume everyone else is having a great time and has lots of friends, but even ‘popular’ people get lonelyA reader shared a phrase I like, which is that you can have “friends for a reason, friends for a season, or friends for life”, and I think that’s true. Friendships until this point have probably been circumstantial – you were bound together by proximity – but now they have to be worked at.I think there’s this idea that friendships should just happen, but they need input and confidence (everyone is scared of rejection and this can hold us back). People also presume everyone else is having a great time and has lots of friends, but even “popular” people get lonely (sometimes the busiest people are the loneliest)skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Could this be a good opportunity to put an appeal out to your online friends for anyone interested in a face-to-face friendship? You may be surprised to find others in your situation.” But if you don’t get any takers – and I know this is easier said than done – don’t take it personally and keep trying. Avoid people who say they don’t need more friends: often they have intimacy issues.“Friendships develop over time and are not instantaneously constructed,” says Maldonado-Page, “so try to take the pressure off yourself. I’ve also learned, through my lived experience and my clinical work, that the quantity of ‘real friends’ tends to decrease as you get older, but the quality of those fewer friends becomes greater, leading to more fulfilling friendships.”In my experience, good friendships start with small steps. Ask a colleague if they’d like to go for coffee, or even a walk around the block at lunchtime. Get to know them and see ifyou’dlike to be their friend. Change the focus. It doesn’t have to be about activities – these work for some people and not others; they’re not for me – but remember you could always start something informal. A lunchtime walking group, a once-a-month Saturday brunch club? Invite people to yours? I think formal groups/activities work for some people and not others – they’re not for me and they might not be for you.Most of all, remember it all takes time, and you have plenty of it.Every week, Annalisa Barbieri addresses a personal problem sent in by a reader.

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Strong, beautiful and, if well looked after, endlessly long-lasting: leather has long been a staple of many of our wardrobes. And while there areethical and environmental reasons to consider not buying new leather, the leather items you already own (or buy secondhand) could well outlast you, so it’s important to look after them properly. So, how do you make sure your favourite items – from a handbag to a beloved jacket – last so that you can pass them down the generations?The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.I spoke to experts to gather their tips and tricks for how best to clean, preserve and repair leather items, so that they keep being useful, and beautiful, for as long as possible.How to make your leather clothing, shoes and accessories last longerKnow your leatherThere are four main grades of leather. The highest are full grain and top grain, used for products such as designer handbags. Split leather is more affordable and made from a lower layer of the hide; depending on the way it has been finished, it can be smooth or soft to the touch. Split leather is generally less durable than the higher grades, but it’s used for everything from shoes to clothing to upholstery. Bonded leather is essentially a composite material that contains leather fibres, and is cheaper and less durable still.The higher the grade, the longer the leather should last, says Antony Frith, owner of Shoe Healer, traditional cobblers in Doncaster. But you don’t need different products or methods to look after the different kinds: “As a rule, we treat them all the same,” he says.That may be true for most smooth leathers, but textured materials such as suede and nubuck, unusual leathers such as buffalo hide and those with special finishes need a different approach. If you’re not sure what kind you’re dealing with, take it to a local cobbler for advice.How to restore a leather handbag at homeRead moreClean carefullyView image in fullscreenBaby wipes are soft enough for a baby’s bottom and soft enough for your leather.Photograph: dimamorgan12/Getty Images/iStockphotoTo remove everyday grime from smooth leather, use baby wipes, says Roque Furtado atJT Batchelor, a specialist leather supplier in London. Gently brush off any dry dust or dirt, then wipe over the leather, without scrubbing or rubbing too hard.If the grime is ingrained and that doesn’t do the job,the next step is saddle soap, which comes as a bar, paste or spray. “The spray is generally easiest to use,” Furtado says. JT Batchelor sells US brandFiebing’s, but there are plenty of others available (tryDecathlon). Again, brush off dry dirt, then, using a damp cloth, work up a lather with the soap and rub gently over the leather. Rinse the cloth and wipe away any remaining foam.For textured materials such as suede and nubuck, some (including Nike) recommendwhite vinegar. Put a little vinegar (you can dilute and use half water and half vinegar, if you prefer) on to alint-free clothand clean the area gently. Or brush with asuede brushand use adedicated suede cleaning product. For patent finishes, just use a soft, damp cloth.“You don’t need to buy the products made by the brand selling you the bag or shoes,” says Dai Rees, designer and programme director for craft at the London College of Fashion. “It will be the same compounds and materials as any other.” Hermès, for example, sellsits own glycerine soap barfor leather for £40, while Lincoln Horse Caresells a similar bar for £6.99.Whatever product you use, always test it on a small inconspicuous area first, to check it doesn’t alter the finish or affect the colour, and let it dry completely before using it on the rest of the item.How often you should clean your shoes depends on how frequently you wear them, and whether you’re traipsing across muddy fields or hopping in and out of Ubers in them. But keeping the leather clean, nourished and in good condition should help them last longer.View image in fullscreenAqua Wipes biodegradable plastic-free baby wipes£1.90 for a pack of 56 at Boots£5 for 12 packs of 12 at AmazonView image in fullscreenTesco distilled vinegar35p for 568ml at TescoView image in fullscreenLint-free cleaning cloths£3.99 for five at B&QView image in fullscreenSolid glycerine soap for shoes and leather£3.99 for 150ml at DecathlonView image in fullscreenThe Scratch Doctor suede and nubuck cleaner and brush£13.95 at B&Q£13.95 at AmazonRemove stainsView image in fullscreenStain care depends on whether your leather was processed with vegetable or chrome tanning.Photograph: Vitalii Bezverkhii/Getty Images/iStockphotoWhat if you get a red wine stain on a cream bag or tomato sauce on a suede jacket? Your chances of getting it out depend somewhat on the kind of leather you have. Leather is generally processed in one of two ways: vegetable tanning or chrome tanning.Chrome creates a resistant surface, while vegetable methods, favoured by high-end and sustainable brands, leave the grain of the leather more open. “Leather that has been vegetable tanned tends to have a more natural look, with a more open grain. It weathers beautifully, but it is more susceptible to moisture or marks. Chrome tanned leather tends to be smoother to the touch,” says Frith.When red wine splashes on to a chrome-tanned bag, “it may repel the liquid”, he says. But with vegetable tanned or older leather where the grain has opened up, it’s likely to stain.That said, you might still be able to save it. First, use saddle soap, then let it dry completely. “Then you have to recolour it, and the best way to do that is with a spray dye that resurfaces the leather,” Frith says. He recommendsSaphir’s Tenax leather dyeorMagixfor smooth leather, while Saphir’sRenovétineprotects and revives suede and nubuck.There are no guarantees, of course, and as ever, you should test on a small section that can’t be seen first. If in doubt, ask a local cobbler or professional cleaner for advice on the best approach.View image in fullscreenSaphir Tenax leather dye spray£15.95 for 150ml at eBayView image in fullscreenMagix leather dye spray£9.99 for 180ml at eBayView image in fullscreenSaphir Renovétine suede reviver spray£16.95 for 200ml at eBay£10.72 for 200ml at AmazonNourish – and protect from the elementsView image in fullscreenPrevention is the best cure for wear and tear.Photograph: FilippoBacci/Getty Images“Treat leather as the skin it is,” says Sarah Spicer, shoemaker atGreen Shoesin Devon. “It needs to be conditioned and moisturised.”For smooth leather, Frith says, “the number one rule is that hard polish is no good. You’ve got to use a cream. If you leave a tin of shoe polish out, it will soon dry up and crack. And it will do the same thing to your shoes or bag.

Frith says nano sprays are “superb”. These (such as Crep Protect) form a protective layer against moisture and oils – and might protect against stains, too. Follow the instructions on the packaging to find out how often you should spray them, as this varies. “We sell some that recommend you spray every three to four weeks, and others that say every six months,” Frith says.If you get caught in the rain, don’t dry leather by the radiator and don’t use a hairdryer. Let it dry naturally, then treat it again with the right protective product.View image in fullscreenSaphir Crème Surfine shoe cream£9.75 for 50ml at eBay£9.20 for 50ml at AmazonView image in fullscreenBeeswax leather balsam£10.95 for 250ml at eBayView image in fullscreenCherry Blossom Eco Ultra Repel£5.95 for 100ml at John LewisView image in fullscreenCrep Protect£12 at Schuh£12 at JD SportsView image in fullscreenThe Handbag Clinic leather care kit£19.99 at AmazonStore safelyAlways store leather items in a clean, dry place out of direct sunlight, says Edyta Knapinska, handbag buyer at John Lewis, as it will prolong their life. Stow handbags in your wardrobe or a cupboard, inside a protective dust bag if you can. Sometimes these are thrown in when you buy a bag. If not, you can buy them (such as these ones made byHayden Hill) to keep bags clean and dust-free.DunelmandIkeahave a range of shoe cabinets.Sunlight is particularly damaging when leather is vegetable tanned, as it will literally tan. “If you keep one shoe in the sun and the other in the shade, the one in the sun will end up darker.”Aboot-shaperwill help avoid creases and strain on the zip from being folded, while some people swear byshoe treesfor looking after favourite shoes, particularly those only worn occasionally. Frith says cedar is the best wood for these – it absorbs moisture and keeps them fresh.When storing leather jackets, Frith says: “Leather is heavy and if you hang it from one point, it will sag and lose its shape. So use a sturdy hanger, not a coat hook.” Look for broad, rounded ends to keep the shoulders in shape, like onthis one from John Lewis.For long-term storage of leather jackets, Frith recommends first airing well (that can be outside, or anywhere air circulates, just not in a wardrobe), then hanging the jacket in a zip-uppolythene garment bag. “Leather takes in moisture from the air and even from our bodies when we use it every day. But when you put these things away for a long time, the leather can dry out,” he says. “A polythene zip-up bag, like those you get from the dry cleaners, or even just a big polythene bag, will control the airflow. It won’t be completely airtight, but it will keep some moisture in and protect the leather from drying out.”View image in fullscreenEloise sliding shoe storage cabinet£63.20 at DunelmView image in fullscreenDasco boot shaper£18.50 at Charles ClinkardView image in fullscreenSuit hanger£8 at John LewisView image in fullscreenMoth-proof garment bag£12.22 at AmazonChoose vintage leather carefullyView image in fullscreen‘It’s much harder to restore and renovate old leather than it is to take care of leather that is still in good shape.’Photograph: yul38885 yul38885/Getty ImagesSecondhand leather often has a wonderful patina and lived-in quality. But vintage leather can need a bit of love to bring it back to life. Charity shops and online stores such asVintedandVestiaire Collectiveare great hunting grounds for preloved leather jackets, bags and shoes, but check that a piece is not beyond repair before you buy, says Frith. “It’s much harder to restore and renovate old, worn or damaged leather than it is to take care of leather that is still in good shape,” he says.“Where possible, check for signs of dryness or cracking. The leather on a briefcase or secondhand handbag might have survived well, but the cotton stitching could be deteriorating. So, when you’re buying anything at all, it’s good to stress test the leather and the stitching. Because you might find one day it just falls apart.” Pull and manipulate seams and any areas that look a bit tired, to make sure there are no signs of disintegration.For online purchases, where you can’t hold the item in your hands, ask sellers to provide closeup photos of the areas that are most prone to cracking or strain – seams, straps or handles, zips and creases. If you decide to buy, look after the item well and you’ll be able to enjoy it for a long time to come.Sandra Haurant is ajournalist who has been writing for the Guardian for more than two decades.

No, stop!Grace DentSun 8 Jun 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 8 Jun 2025 01.14 EDTShareOne undeniable fact about Angelina, which has just openeda second sitein Spitalfields, east London, is that in the now mini-group’s relatively short existence, they’ve singlehandedly made the phrase “Italian-Japanese restaurant” seem a much more normal thing to say. Patently,Angelina Mark 1over in Dalston was not the first time in culinary history that Milan met Tokyo over the stoves, that miso met pasta, that truffle met sushi, and so on; hungry people have always travelled, merged cuisines and messed about with flavours. Still, the original Angelina’skaiseki-style tasting menu, wherechawanmushi(savoury egg custard) is served with datterini tomatoes, and pastas are topped withfurikake, was clearly interesting enough to attract theattention of Michelin.Its new sister, Osteria Angelina, is darkly chic, spacious (handy for group dining) and tucked away down a side road onthe Norton Folgate developmentclose to Shoreditch overground station (fans of the Sri Lankan restaurantKolombaon Kingly Street near Oxford Circus will find a second outpost,Kolomba East, in the same area, andNoisy Oyster, from the people behindFirebird, will soon be joining them). To give credit where its due, Norton Folgate is a refreshingly beautiful restoration project, where spruced-up Edwardian, Georgian and Victorian buildings mix with new-builds to create a little slice of sedate elegance away from the bottomless brunch,Box Park hellscapethat is modern Shoreditch. Escape the main drag, hop into Osteria Angelina, sit up at the marble bar in front of the open kitchen and order snacks of pizza nera topped withmoromi, a rich fermented soy paste, or a salad of zucchini and shiso leaves with ricotta.View image in fullscreen‘Hot as hell and generously stuffed’: Osteria Angelina’s fried courgette flowers with miso ricotta.From the number of people eating here just two weeks after it opened, this cultural clash clearly has its fans. What Osteria Angelina’s Japanese customers, with their relatively orderly rules of social conduct and deference, make of the place’s excessively animated Italian servers, however, is one for the anthropology books. All this, I guess, is smoothed over by the likes of the nori-topped focaccia and the small, sweet mini-loaf of Hokkaido milk bread, the very memory of which has me salivating; that’s served with a kumquat reduction – OK, let’s call it jam – and a puddle of burnt honey butter.After thepaneandinsalatesections, the menu moves on tofrittiandcrudo. We ordered a plate of hot-as-hell tempura’d courgette flowers stuffed generously with miso ricotta. Crudo is so often a disappointment, but here the bream is cured in kombu and doused in yet more burnt butter, making it rather wickedly appealing. Hamachi sashimi was also very good, and smothered in truffled soy and furikake.View image in fullscreenOsteria Angelina’s ‘immensely comforting’ fazzoletti with duck ragu and lotus.Dinner here could easily be made up purely of a collection of these small plates and some bread to mop up the exquisite oils, but that would mean missing out on the freshagnolottiand tortellini. The pasta offering changes frequently, but expect the likes of immensely comforting fazzoletti with a rich duck ragu and lotus, crab and sausage-filled agnolotti and whelk risotto with burnt soy butter.Larger meaty and fishy things, meanwhile, are grilled in front of you onbinchō-tancoals behind the bar. Tongue with wasabi, anyone? Or, more simply, some Brixham skate wing or a Blythburgh pork chop? Angus steak comes rare, drenched in miso butter, alongside our side order ofNamaYasaigreens and an extra portion oftsukemonopickles.There’s a lot to adore about all of this cooking; it’s generous, oily, saucy and certainly not to be eaten every day. Every plate we tried swam in some variation on spiced, seasoned, miso-flecked oil that would have been a terrible waste to consign to the dishwasher. How about some more bread and the remnants of that house ponzu? Wait, they’re taking away the delicious white balsamic dressing that came with the tempura agretti? No, stop!View image in fullscreen‘Dark, gloomy, stodgy’: Osteria Angelina’s brulee black sesame cheesecake with milk gelato.In fact, the only thing that left me slightly cold, other than the damned uncomfortable chairs with backrests so far back that you’re almost lying down, was the brulee’d black sesame cheesecake with milk ice-cream, which, though visually interesting – dark, gloomy, stodgy – had about it the air of something that had been mass-produced, in much the same way as a Pizza Express cheesecake probably wasn’t made by chef’s nonna that morning, but rather came out of a packet from the freezer. Next time – and there will be a next time – I’ll go for thegenmaicha purinandkinakogreen tea rice pudding.Osteria Angelina shouldn’t work, but it absolutely does.

Described by the Liverpool Daily Post in 1962 as “roast chicken Indian fashion”, this delicately seasoned, but often luridly coloured, dish was once the mainstay of the British Indian restaurant menu; yet, always greedy for novelty, I can’t remember when I last had the pleasure.The loss is mine, because it’s one of the very best ways to eat chicken – rich and tender, thanks to its yoghurt marinade, tangy with lemon and perfumed with spice.Vivek Singh arguesthat “no Punjabi celebration can be complete without tandoori chicken”, while J Inder Singh Kalra went as far as to crown it the“king of kebabs”, a sentiment echoed by Rohit Ghai.The issue for domestic cooks is, of course, that few of us have the clay oven, ortandoor, from which the dish takes its name. Traditionally used to cook bread, and capable of getting up to astonishingly high temperatures, it’s this that gives tandoori chicken its characteristically smoky flavour. So, assuming you don’t happen to have one handy, what’s the best way to make tandoori-style chicken at home?The chickenTandoori chicken is usually a whole bird cut into pieces and threaded on to skewers, ready to be lowered into the oven – using boneless chicken pieces instead, as newly crowned Fortnum & Mason cookery writer of the yearRavinder Bhogal notesin these very pages, will get “dinner on the table faster” (she suggests using thigh for tikka, which I’d echo, because it stays much juicier).View image in fullscreenNik Sharma uses drumsticks to make his tandoori chicken. All thumbnails by Felicity Cloake.Most recipes specify either a whole bird or an assortment of joints –drumsticks for Nik Sharma,legs and breasts for Madhur Jaffrey– but because they’re for the most part all cut into pieces, you can adapt this to suit your own preference, with the caveat that I wouldn’t recommend using just breast, because it does dry out very easily. A mixture, or legs alone, is a far better bet.Both Bhogal and Singh spatchcock the whole bird, splaying it out so it cooks more evenly. This looks impressive, but I’ve decided to stick with pieces only, not least because of the risk of overcooking the white meat; this way, it’s easy to whip out the breasts and leave in the legs for a few minutes longer.Tandoori chicken is almost always skinless – only Ghai and those cooking whole birds (Bhogal andRoopa Gulati) don’t mention removing it – because it gives the marinade better access to the meat. The yoghurty coating will play a similar protective role, insulating the flesh from direct heat, while a couple of deep slashes will bring the marinade, and its flavour, into the centre of the meat.The marinadeThe consensus breaks down when it comes to the marinade. Sharma, Bhogal and Sarah Woods’s lovely bookDesi Kitchenall use a single marinade, whileRick Stein’s India, Inder Singh Kalra’sPrashad, Ghai’sYatra,Keith Floyd’s India,Jaffrey’s Indian Cookeryand Gulati’sCurry Loversemploy a two-step process in which the meat is first rubbed with citrus juice or vinegar, salt and sometimes a few aromatics (ginger and garlic paste for Ghai; turmeric, chilli and pepper for Gulati) and left for half an hour or so before the yoghurt mix is added.View image in fullscreenRoopa Gulati covers the whole bird in a white-wine vinegar marinade.And this extra step seems well worth it, because, the spices aside, lemon (you could use lime or Gulati’s white-wine vinegar instead, if you prefer) and salt seem to me the top notes of every tandoori chicken I can remember eating. Salt is the only molecule that is small enough here realistically topenetrate into the interior, but the rest will season the outside well enough to flavour every bite regardless (most British chicken is young enough that tenderness ought not to be an issue).The dairy marinade, which contains fat that will dissolve the aromatics in the spices, so they coat the meat thoroughly, will stay largely on the surface of the chicken, as a kind of integral sauce. The thicker the yoghurt, the more easily it will stick, so a greek-style thick one is ideal. You could also add pureed red onion, as Sharma does, or Jaffrey’s yellow onion. Green chillies are also popular, as is chilli powder (whether readymade or ground from dried Kashmiri chillies). Cumin is near ubiquitous; peppercorns, fenugreek and turmeric pop up a lot, as do sweeter spices such as green cardamom and cloves – I particularly enjoy Bhogal’s luxurious cinnamon and saffron, for example.That said, I want to keep my recipe fairly simple, because my testers and I all enjoy Jaffrey’s tandoori chicken, spiced with fresh green chilli, garam masala and paprika, so much, which proves you don’t need a kaleidoscope of spices to make your own. That’s why I’ve stuck with garam masala (which, in India, usually includes cumin, coriander, cinnamon, cardamom, cloves and peppercorns) plus a little extra cumin, though you may well want to add other spices that take your fancy. (Saffron comes highly recommended, both for its elusive fragrance and the colour it lends.)View image in fullscreenMadhur Jaffrey marinades her chicken pieces for as long as 24 hours, which seems a bit excessive.Time-wise, and though I hate to disagree with Jaffrey, I don’t think “the longer, the better” applies here. After her recommended 24 hours in the marinade, the surface of the chicken is a little bit mushy, so four to six hours feels like the sweet spot. Possibly chickens were tougher back in 1982?The colourThe tandoori chicken I grew up on got what Mallika Basu describesin her book Masalaas its “characteristic Day-Glo red appearance from a dash of artificial colour, but”, she adds, “Kashmiri chilli powder or paprika is more commonly used at home”. Sharma suggests adding some beetroot, “which does work very well without affecting the taste, though I will admit, I wish it were a deeper shade of red. However, too much beet could also end up sweetening the chicken, which is something I wanted to avoid”.Stein uses beetroot powder instead, which can be found at specialist spice retailers (I bought some from Spice Mountain at London’s Borough Market,which also sells online), but I think you get just as good a result from Jaffrey’s paprika rub. Alternatively, if it just doesn’t feel like tandoori chicken if it doesn’t glow in the dark, use an artificial colouring; if you don’t worry about eating it in cakes and sweets, it feels illogical to avoid it here (Dan Toombs notes that, contrary to packet instructions, you shouldrub the colouring directly on to the meat).View image in fullscreenFelicity Cloake’s perfect tandoori chicken, as cooked on a barbecue …The cookingJaffrey excitedly reports that, “I have, I think, found a way to make tandoor-style chicken without a tandoor!” which, “as I am sure you all know by now, is a vat-shaped clay oven, heated with charcoal or wood. The heat inside builds up to such an extent that small whole chickens, skewered and thrust into it, cook in about 10 minutes. The fierce heat seals the juices of the bird and keeps it moist … the result is quite spectacular.” Her home solution is an oven heated to its maximum temperature: “The cooking time is not 10 minutes, because home ovens do not get as hot as tandoors. Still, breasts cook in 15 or 20 minutes and legs in 20 to 25 minutes.”View image in fullscreenFelicity Cloake’s perfect tandoori chicken fresh from the oven.Sharma also uses the oven, though at a mere 200C, then finishes off the drumsticks under the grill. Ghai’s book Yatra uses a hot grill alone (time to switch on that extractor fan), while Singh and Bhogal prefer the barbecue, which is, in my opinion, the ideal scenario for a slightly smoky flavour. If that’s not practical, a very hot oven is the next best thing, though I’d advise you to check on the breasts towards the end of the cooking time, and take them out early, if necessary. Bhogal’s drizzle of ghee, while to some extent gilding the lily, helps to stop the chicken drying out while it rests (she also finishes the dish with a sprinkle of chaat masala).Honourable mention goes to Gulati’s whole tandoori chicken. Smothered in marinade, stuffed with buttery rice and roasted whole, it’s utterly delicious if you’re looking for a less traditional take on the classic. It’s one that I will certainly make again.The extrasBhoghal gives recipes for coriander and mint chutney, kachumber salad and garlic naan, all of which work very well with tandoori chicken, as do basmati rice and, indeed, a masala gravy.View image in fullscreenRavinder Bhogal serves her tandoori chicken with a coriander and mint chutney.Alternatively, you might prefer shredded iceberg, some lemon wedges and a pint of Kingfisher on the side: entirely up to you. (It would be remiss of me not to inform you that any leftovers make excellent sandwiches – or, like Sharma, you might prefer to freeze some of it after two hours of marinating.)Perfect tandoori chicken (without a tandoor)Prep15 minMarinate4½-6½ hrCook25 minServes46 chicken pieces– 2 bone-in thighs, 2 drumsticks, 2 breasts, all skinless6 garlic cloves, peeled1 tbsp grated ginger1-1½ tsp salt6 tbsp lemon or lime juice, or white-wine vinegar1 tsp cumin seeds2 green chillies250g thick, greek-style plain yoghurt4 tsp garam masalaBlack pepper2 tbsp sweet paprika, or 1 tbsp mild chilli powder2 tbsp gheeor oilView image in fullscreenTake the skin off the chicken, if necessary, then cut the legs and breasts into two pieces each, then cut a couple of deep slashes in each piece.View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenPeel the ginger and garlic, then mash both to a paste with the salt (adjust to your taste) in a mortar or mini chopper, then stir in the lemon juice.

Finely chop the chilli and mash to a paste – I add it to the mortar with the cumin. Stir both into the yoghurt, then mix in the garam masala and a good grind of black pepper.Smear the paprika all over the chicken, followed by the yoghurt, making sure to get this as far into the cuts as possible, then cover and chill for four to six hours. Take the chicken out of the fridge half an hour before you want to start cooking it.View image in fullscreenLight the barbecue or heat the oven to 240C (230C fan)/475F/gas 9 (or as high as it will go). Once the barbecue or oven is ready (the barbecue coals should be glowing white hot, and no flames should be visible), grease the barbecue grill or a baking tray with ghee or oil, then lay on the chicken pieces, shaking off any excess marinade back into the bowl.View image in fullscreenGrill or roast for 15 minutes, then brush all over with the extra marinade and turn over the chicken pieces. Cook for 10-15 minutes longer, or until cooked through and beginning to char; check on the breasts after 10 minutes, just to be on the safe side.Take off the grill/out of the oven, brush all over with the remaining ghee, if using, and leave to rest for 10-15 minutes before serving.Tandoori chicken – is it indeed the king of kebabs (even if you don’t use a skewer), and is there any point in making it without the eponymous clay oven?

In inner-city Melbourne, where we’d been living, we had a support network of neighbours, friends and family. In Healesville we didn’t know a soul. It was just me and my husband, our two little kids and two dogs.We hadn’t been there long when we all came down with the flu. It wasn’t a cold, it was theflu– complete with aching, fevers and hallucinating. It was terrible.We did have some food in the house but not much. At some stage I tried to drive down to the shops to get us something to eat but I had to turn back because I was too sick to navigate. We lived 5km out of town so walking in wasn’t an option. There were no takeaway food outlets in the town and, of course, this was long before the days of food deliveries. I didn’t know any doctors nearby and, being so far from family, there was no one I could call on for help. I remember desperately saying to my husband, “We have to feed the dogs!” We were stuck.The kindness of strangers: when my period arrived, a lifeguard quietly put a towel around meRead moreThen there was a phone call. On the other end was a woman who worked with my husband at his new job. We’d never met but she’d got wind that we were sick and let me know she’d just dropped a big pot of soup on our doorstep. That soup saved us – even the dogs got some. It sustained us for days, until I was well enough to prepare the most basic of meals.Without that help, which came so out of the blue, I don’t know what we would have done. I later got to know that woman, Kath, and learned that this is typical behaviour for her. She’s a very kind-hearted, community-minded person.Kath’s act of kindness made me appreciate how much small gestures can mean – as well as what a lovely act of compassion making a meal for someone is. Cooking up a big pot of soup has become my go-to thing when someone is sick. It’s always appreciated.What is the nicest thing a stranger has ever done for you?Share your experienceFrom making your day to changing your life, we want to hear about  chance encounters that have stuck with you.Please share your story if you are 18 or over, anonymously if you wish.

She’s been through a lot, but is still smiling, still battling, still fighting and still happy. I had monkfish, then stuffed cod with reduced lobster bisque. It was delicious.View image in fullscreenThe big beefIsabelFor me, the NHS must be preserved. What I didn’t realise until I spoke to Naser was just how much strain everybody in the NHS is under. It wasn’t that we disagreed about the size of it, it was more about how it is managed. The impression I had initially is that he wanted to cut it back, but what he was actually saying is that because of the pure demands on the service, we need to do what they do in France and Germany, so you pay in and you get mixed access.Dining across the divide: ‘I felt like the atmosphere was quite hostile’Read moreNaserThe French and Dutch systems have insurance models – co-pay – and they don’t have doctors on strike. My proposal was to make corporations and big companies pay for private insurance for their staff. It happens a bit already. Make it law. It will reduce the financial burden on the NHS. But the problems in the NHS aren’t just about money – you could add another £10bn/20bn/30bn and the fundamental flaws would still be there.IsabelWhen you think of an insurance model, you always think of America, where if you don’t have the money, you die. I still don’t know what the right answer is. I don’t think I broadened his perspective; he knows what it’s like. He was coming from a place of taking the pressure off the people who work in the NHS. They need to feel that they’re valued, that they can do their jobs, that the facilities are good.NaserI’ve seen private prescriptions just explode – people can’t get to see their GP and they’d rather pay £50 than go through the frustration. So they’re being forced into it, rather than it being organised properly. Why can you buy a box of Viagra over the counter, but not a blue asthma inhaler? This is an unnecessary regulatory burden that means people have to faff around, involve 111 and emergency services.View image in fullscreenSharing plateIsabelBasically, we really bonded over the fact that when you’re a second-generation immigrant, your parents say: lawyer, doctor, accountant, those are the jobs you’re allowed to do. It’s very hard to break free from those shackles if you want to do something else. We both understood it – we both saw it.NaserShe’s Ghanaian by background; I’m Palestinian. We had a lot of shared immigrant perspective. We both felt that our parents pushed us hard to go to university, to go into a profession, to prove ourselves. They wanted to justify the investment,  justify leaving, to people back home. My dad was a consultant surgeon, head of his department in the NHS, but did he have to do that? Could he not just have been a good guy?View image in fullscreenFor aftersIsabelThe Labour party have really moved away from where they started, and become a centre-right party.

But rather than stealing from the rich to give to the poor like Robin Hood, this group tries to convince hard-up borrowers they are not legally bound by their mortgage contract.It may sound far-fetched but the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has sounded the alarm over this conspiracy theory as a small but growing number of homeowners are using this argument to try to block repossession proceedings.“We’re aware of mortgage holders in financial difficulty who are being misled by this online misinformation, often with serious financial consequences,” the FCA says.The “freemen on the land” movement – sometimes written as “FOTL” or just “freemen” – claims individuals are only bound only by the contracts and laws they consent to, often using arguments dating back to Magna Carta. It is not a new phenomenon but is gaining currency in the UK thanks to social media.People involved in the movement post information and eviction videos online, including on YouTube. The accounts can have thousands of followers and some videos have been viewed close to half a million times.Mortgage lenders are reporting a rise in borrowers using these arguments.The FCA says that some borrowers have paid individuals a fee to take their claims to court to avert their home being repossessed. However it says: “None of these claims have succeeded as they’re not legally valid.“Other people have ended up losing not just their homes but also a large chunk of their equity.”On its website the housing charity Shelter has a round up of what it calls a “growing trend ofconspiracy theory litigants”. In one case, a judge dismissed 13 separate claims against various mortgage lenders and expressed concern about an “unseen hand” behind the court documents.What the scam looks likeThe misinformation is being spread by word of mouth or in help groups on social media sites. “People are using informal channels like Facebook groups to find help and these individuals are in those groups saying: ‘Yes, I can,’” says one expert who did not want to be named.Greg Sachrajda, the head of department in the FCA’s retail banking directorate, suggests that some people who are at risk of losing their home are “susceptible to arguments that make things sound better”.But he says: “If you borrow money, you’re required to repay it, and you only make the situation worse by trying to rely on false arguments which the courts are rejecting.“We’ve seen examples of people not only losing their home but also then getting less back from the proceeds of the sale of the home.”The same bogus arguments are being used to avoid council tax payments and parking fines. Indeed numerous councils devote sections on their websites to debunking “Freemen” ideas.Thurrock council, for example, spells out that “rights claimed under common law, are not the same as laws relating to council tax”, adding: “You don’t have a ‘choice’ as to whether you are liable for council tax.”What to doDo not believe the claims.If you are struggling to repay your mortgage the short answer is: speak to your lender.Lenders are required to treat borrowers in financial difficulty fairly and the options available could include extending the term of the loan, temporarily switching to an interest-only mortgage, or even agreeing a payment holiday.Selling up may turn out to be right thing to do but even then the lender should be able to help. Many lenders offer what is called an “assisted voluntary sale”. This gives the borrower more time to sell the property and the lender can help with the costs. This can maximise the amount of money the individual realises from the sale.A spokesperson for the lenders’ trade body UK Finance says: “It’s always worth seeking independent legal advice before acting on information you find online as understanding your legal position fully will help protect you from costly mistakes.”Speak to your council if you are struggling with your council tax bill.There are other places you can turn to for help with debts.National Debtline,StepChange,Citizens Adviceand the government-backedMoneyHelperservice are among those offering free support.Explore more on these topicsScamsMortgagesPropertyConsumer affairsBanks and building societiesBankingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

A hike along the extensive trails in Alta Badia promises delicious diversions by way of the region’s myriad mountain huts, each of which has its own talented chef crafting intriguing local dishes.Base yourself in La Villa and take the cable car up to Piz La Ila, a ski station that’s ideal for hiking in summer. At the top, a small pool offers dogs a place to cool down before a walk toRifugio Ütia Bioch, an alpine hut at more than 2,000 metres (6,560 ft), which serves cocktails with foraged flowers and herbs alongside traditional Ladin food from the region.Over in Colfosco, another gondola lifts you to the terraces ofJimmi Hüttefor red wine risotto and alpine aperols with views of the jagged Pizes de Cir.Where to stayIn La Villa,Hotel Antineshas striking views of the Dolomites and an owner who loves dogs so much she’ll make yours a freshly cooked dinner. Rooms from €278 a night half-board.ValpolicellaView image in fullscreenThe Valpolicella region is north of Verona.Photograph: Lynne Nieman/AlamyA slow, meandering road trip through the low-lying hills of the Valpolicella wine region north of Verona is an idyllic way to spend a few days with your dog in summer or early autumn. Italy is famously a dog-loving nation, and that doesn’t stop at the cellar door – many of the wineries and agriturismos here open their doors to dogs.Head toLa Cantina e Agriturismo Corte Mercito taste its Valpolicella Ripasso, which is given a second fermentation to create a richer and pleasingly complex red, or sample the wines atTenuta Santa Maria di Gaetano Bertani, which allows small dogs inside for its tours and tastings. Dine atEnoteca del Bugiardoin the town of Pedemonte for excellent pairings of locally sourced cheeses and the region’s best wines.Where to staySleep amid the vines atDimora Buglioni Wine Relais, which has a fantastic dog-friendly restaurant. Rooms from €122 B&B a night; dogs €24 a night.LiguriaView image in fullscreenSunset walkies in Albissola.Photograph: Maudanros/ShutterstockMost Italian beaches are off limits for dogs in summer, but not in Liguria. The fine yellow sand, thatched parasols and rows of loungers atBau Bau Villagein Albissola Marina, 22 miles west of Genoa, look like your average beach club, but the majority of its patrons do their paddling with four legs instead of two.Founded by Elisabetta dall’Orto in 1997, the beach has become the go-to destination for sea-loving dogs and their owners, offering an agility area on the sand, evening film screenings and a dog-friendly restaurant. There are even showers for getting the salt out of your pooch’s coat before you head into town to visit the dog-friendlyCasa Museo Jorn, the former home of Danish artist and sculptor Asger Jorn.Where to stayNH Savona Darsena, less than two miles from Bau Bau Village, has rooms from €129 a night, dogs €25 a night (must be under 25kg).FRANCETouraine, Loire valleyView image in fullscreenDogs are welcome on leads in the grounds of Château de Chenonceau in the Loire valley.Photograph: Constantinos Iliopoulos/AlamyFew dog walks feel quite as fancy as those that take place in the grounds of the Loire valley’s great chateaux. This region, located just a couple of hours south of Paris, is known for magnificent castles that were once the summer residences of kings, queens and nobles.Château de Chenonceauis the jewel of the valley, its steeply pointed turrets rising several storeys above the Cher river, and dogs are welcome throughout the grounds on a lead and indoors too as long as you carry them (they won’t judge if you want to give your labrador a firefighter’s lift).In nearby Amboise, explore both theChâteau RoyalandChâteau du Clos Lucé, which have some fascinating Leonardo da Vinci heritage, and don’t miss eating your way around Tours withFood Tours in Tours.Where to stayA week at troglodyte cave dwellingLe Martin Pêcheurfrom €396.ReimsView image in fullscreenPerfect dog-walking territory: Parc Naturel Régional de la Montagne de Reims.Photograph: Hemis/AlamyPosh dogs, walk this way: the world‑famous Champagne region is a truly dog-loving destination.While many of the larger champagne houses in and around Reims don’t allow pets, a handful of smaller winemakers welcome them with open arms (and a glass of bubbles). Tours are dog-friendly atGH Martel, as are the cellar visits atChampagne Harlin Père et Fils, a 35-minute drive from Reims. Many other houses and vineyards allow dogs in drinking areas for tastings on terraces or inside their bars.For walks, head to Parc de Champagne in central Reims, which has beautiful landscaped gardens and wooded areas for shady strolls when the sun’s out, or drive out to theParc Naturel Régional de la Montagne de Reimsfor longer trails in the hills.Where to stayAppart’City Conforthas self-catering apartments from €70 a night (dogs must be under 30kg).Pas-de-CalaisView image in fullscreenBeach huts in dog-friendly Le Touquet in France.Photograph: Hemis/AlamyDog-friendly beaches can be hard to come by during summer in France, as dog bans come into force throughout much of the country from May until September. But you needn’t go far to find spectacular sands to share with the dog in the Pas-de-Calais, as several seaside towns along Côte d’Opale have really embraced what they are callingtoutourisme– travel designed with dogs in mind.Head an hour south of Calais to Berck, home to a wide, brilliantly bright white-sand beach where dogs are welcome on its northern and southern sections even in August. Or stop in bougie Le Touquet, 10 miles north of Berck, for wonderful walks through sand dunes that end at the dog-friendly restaurantLa Base Nordright on the Baie de Canche. The tourist offices in both towns offer welcome packs for dogs, including treats, plus maps showing walks, eateries and accommodation suitable for dogs.Where to stayA five-minute walk from the dog-friendly Plage Sainte-Cécile,Evancy Camiers-Sainte-Cécile, Trésors d’Opalehas self-catering apartments with balconies overlooking the pool from €94 a night, dogs €12 a night.Canal du MidiView image in fullscreenCruise with your canine along the Canal du Midi.Photograph: Julen Arabaolaza/Getty ImagesSpend your summer in the slow lane of France’s vast transport network and make for the Canal du Midi – a 150‑mile waterway that’s part of a system of canals and rivers that connect the Mediterranean to the Atlantic. Taking in the entire canal would be ambitious even with an entire summer break at your disposal, but hop on board your own houseboat in Trèbes and you can cruise with the dog all the way to historic Carcassonne and beyond.Alongside the old walled city, where you’ll find the medieval streets littered with dog-friendly bar and restaurant terraces, you will pass vineyards and handsome canalside communes with 13th-century churches, before reaching Castelnaudary about 25 miles (and a good few days) later. Canalside walks make for a pleasant morning routine before you spend your days sunning yourselves on the bow as you pootle along, or barbecuing on the back deck.Where to stayFour-berth houseboat fromLe Boat’s Trèbes base from €984 a week, dogs (max two) €85 a rental.PORTUGALPinhãoView image in fullscreenThere are dog-friendly boat trips available at Pinhão.Photograph: Anima DuriusThe wide, winding Douro River is flanked by mesmerisingly terraced vineyards that give this valley a unique character. In summer, the hillsides are flourishing with plump grapes on rich green vines, while in autumn a palette of oranges, reds and browns takes over, drenching the landscape in sepia tones.Whenever you visit with the dog, this is excellent walking country, and from Pinhão there are plenty of waymarked long-distance and shorter circular walks that, conveniently, happen to pass through vineyards and wineries. Between hikes, there aredog-friendly boat tours, wine tours and tastings atCroft Winery, and anolive oil museumin nearby Casal de Loivos.Where to stayThe Suite Nunesapartment has a kitchenette, its own patio and views over the terraces, from €170 a night.LisbonView image in fullscreenA sunset beach walk to the west of Lisbon.Photograph: Gabriel Mello/Getty ImagesPortugal’s capital is an urban dog walker’s paradise – as long as you don’t mind a few hills. Streets lined with pretty whitewashed homes, squares overlooked by baroque-inspired buildings painted in pastel colours, and a host ofmiradouro(viewpoints) for wonderful vistas over the city and towards the ocean make this place a visual feast, ideally explored on foot.Come in spring or early autumn for the best weather (it’s often too hot in summer for dogs unused to the heat) to ascend Miradouro de Santa Luzia to see pretty painted tiles, or Miradouro da Graça for the best sunset views. And if the city gets too much, head along the coast to Estoril and let the dog have a dip in the sea at the dog-friendly coastal area around Praia do Pescoço do Cavalo.Where to stayThe effortlessly coolSelina Secret Gardennear the Bairro Alto neighbourhood offers private, pet-friendly stays from €80 a night, dogs €12 a night.Parque Natural da Serra de São MamedeView image in fullscreenOld cork oak trees in a blooming meadow in the Serra de São Mamede.Photograph: Uwe Moser Moser/AlamyQuiet walking trails, majestic hilltop castles and vast almond and cork-oak plantations abound in this natural park in south-east Portugal. Serra de São Mamede natural park sits on the border with Spain, a world away from Lisbon and the busy Algarve coastline.Its remoteness makes it something of a mission to reach – it’s a good seven-hour drive from the nearest ferry ports in Bilbao or Santander – but once you’re there the rewards are great. This is Portuguese scenery at its best: dramatic quartzite ridges topped with fortified towns such as Marvão and Castelo do Vide; ancient oak forests teeming with wild boar and deer; and a network of prehistoric dolmen (megalithic tombs) to discover as you hike itsmany trails.Where to stayPousada Marvão, where dogs get welcome treats and dinner, has spectacular views of the valley below, from €120 a night.GERMANYBaltic coastView image in fullscreenA havanese enjoys a beach in Heringsdorf.Photograph: buchsammy/Getty ImagesWhile the beaches of southern Europe swelter throughout summer, you can count on Germany’s Baltic coast to keep you and the dog cool. There’s about 600 miles of shoreline here, but one of the most dog-friendly parts lies on the border with Poland on the handsome island of Usedom.Known for its pretty spa town villas in baroque, art nouveau and Palladian styles, the town of Heringsdorf is a great base with a seven-mile-long promenade for walking the dog, and canine-friendly sections of beaches in nearby Bansin. Fascinating military history can be found at thePeenemünde Historical Technical Museum, and there are wonderful forest walks around a lake at Wolgastsee.Where to stayPainted a regal red, and only a few minutes’ walk from the beach,Villa San Remohas one- and two-bed self-catering apartments from €59 a night.Harz mountainsView image in fullscreenDog walking in the Harz mountains.Photograph: David Ziegler/Getty ImagesSomething quite remarkable is going on in the Harz mountains, anational park115 miles south-west of Berlin. Disease, drought and invasive bark beetles have ravaged the spruce trees planted on these mountainsides after the second world war. But take the dog for a long walk from peak to peak, or around its many reservoirs, and you’ll discover a landscape that’s healing and rewilding itself. Beneath the barren, silvery trunks of dead spruce lies a forest floor flourishing with fungi and insects, while native saplings of oak, birch and willow are beginning to thrive.There aretrails aplenty, as well as dog-friendly gondolas and theHarz Railway, a steam train that trundles to the top of the park’s highest peak, the Brocken.Where to stayOn the south-west edge of the Harz mountains, theHardenberg BurgHotelis a brilliant dog-friendly base with an upmarket restaurant. Rooms from €198 a night, dogs €25 a night.SPAINCosta BravaView image in fullscreenL’Estartit beach has a dog-friendly section.Photograph: Boerescu Flaviu/AlamyIf the Atlantic is too chilly a prospect for your dog, let them dip a paw in the balmy waters of the Mediterranean on Spain’s Costa Brava. This part of the coastline has long been popular with Brits, but bringing the dog necessitates getting away from the crowds.The dog-friendly section of beach in L’Estartit is a good mile-long walk from the main stretch in town, and it’s all the quieter for it. Expect soft sand underfoot and a gently sloping beach that’s lapped by calm seas, with views out to the small but striking Illes Medes archipelago.Other dog-friendly stretches of sand abound, including Platja del Rec in L’Escala and a quiet shingle cove in Port de la Selva.Where to staySet on top of hills above the Med in Begur,Hostal Sa Rascassais a homely dog-friendly base with rooms from €125 a night.ValenciaView image in fullscreenThere’s a year round dog-friendly area at the northern end of Playa de Pinedo.Photograph: Lunamarina/Getty ImagesThis coastal city in the east of Spain has several stretches of soft sand for running about with a ball or paddling in the Mediterranean, all of which are dog-friendly outside the main summer season (from June to the end of September), with a year-round dog section at the northern end of Playa de Pinedo.It’s not just about the seaside here, though: the Jardín del Turia is a vast, green artery running through the centre of Valencia, with 136 hectares for dogs to enjoy a sniff about in town, with several enclosed socialisation dog parks and even an agility area. From here, you need only walk 10 minutes into the old town to find dog-friendly bars and terraces for a refreshing sangria.Colmado LaLolawelcomes dogs inside and out, and serves beautifully fresh tapas.Where to stayJust a few minutes’ walk from the Jardín del Turia,Hotel Ad Hoc Carmenallows dogs for city-centre stays. Double rooms from €94 a night.San SebastiánView image in fullscreenBeaches in San Sebastián in Spain are open for dogs outside the summer bathing season.Photograph: Svetlana Maylatova/AlamySan Sebastián has long been famous for its brilliant food scene – it’s the proud home of 19 Michelin stars shared by various restaurants in and around the city. For dog owners, many of these are off limits, but fortunately fantastic food is still on offer in the hundreds of pintxos bars throughout the old and new towns. Most won’t blink an eye if you rock up with your dog on a lead, perhaps after a thigh-burning walk up Monte Urgull (or on the beaches if it’s outside the main bathing season).Eat sea urchins at Casa Vergara, grilled octopus atLa Taberna del Pícaro, or go toBorda Berrifor the smoky pork rib (kebab de costilla de cerdo). And it’s obligatory to finish with a slice of Basque cheesecake anywhere you can find it.Where to stayHotel Catalonia Donostihas a rooftop pool and a spa, and bedrooms from €112 a night.Lottie Gross is the author of upcoming travel guide Dog-Friendly Europe, which will be publishednext yearby ConwayAccommodation prices correct on publication.

But is it fair on the neighbours? Should gardens be quiet spaces without these kinds of sounds?Graham French, Sutton ColdfieldSend new questions tonq@theguardian.com.This week’s question:Are school and college reunions good for us? Or do they just confront us with uncomfortable past versions of ourselves and others, keeping us trapped in old, unhealthy patterns?Post your comments hereReaders replyOnly do it twice per year. Any more and there will be retribution!KrisFerniePlaying music in the garden would be fine if people did it on cold, wet evenings when I’m sitting inside. But my neighbours insist on playing music in their garden on warm, sunny evenings when I want to enjoy being outside to enjoy the peace and quiet of my garden.Chris ShawI would rather hear music than the neighbours having another nasty argument.GrandMoo2018Our neighbours have a sound system in the shed that is easily loud enough to be a professional PA, which is running at ear-splitting volume several times a week and especially on warm days when you might want to spend some time in the garden. We regularly have to shut doors and windows, never mind the heat. It’s impossible to talk outside. Yes, we’ve spoken to them. I think we are due a wider conversation about consideration for others, beyond piecemeal stuff like whether a phone speaker is too loud – we allow these debates to get into the weeds (how do we decide?), where the real issue is selfishness as a whole, right up to the political level.ChocoA person’s back yard should be a haven. Some people have hypersensitivity to sound and they should be able to relax in their own back yard in peace.M JohnsonIt’s not for others to decide how quiet or otherwise others have their gardens unless it’s reaching the levels for which you could get the council involved. The outside isn’t silent!natfantasticOne of our neighbours uses a leaf-blower whatever the season and it wavers around a B-flat. Another is a middle-aged biker with a mate, who, when revving on a Sunday morning, can create duets ranging from a deep low G to a high F#. At the bottom of the garden, we have children who can reach Philip Glass-level operatic heights with a touch of Stockhausen inserted. All in all, I’d kill for some music on speakers!Alec1961I want to extend this to hiking trails. What is it with playing music out loud while you are hiking? Don’t you want to hear the sounds of nature? Isn’t that part of the point?DrMomPAIf you have a job lot of headphones of dubious provenance, you can sell them door-to-door to noisy residents in your locality at competitive prices. Good fences make good neighbours.Eddie ChorepostThis is clearly a question of how loud and how long. That is why we have laws about times of day and decibel levels. If you want silence, move to the country or join a monastery. If you live in a city, there will always be a certain amount of noise. As another writer commented, just don’t be a jerk about it.ChoretownLiberalI think the one thing that is missing mostly is consideration. We all share spaces, unless you have the advantage of significant clear space around your property. If you are the only one out and there is no sound leakage into people’s homes, then have at it. Similarly, if you need to trim, mow or strim vegetation, pick your times so you aren’t waking everyone up or providing hours of machine noise while everyone else wants to enjoy their garden. There will always be the odd flash point with noise, but I find that plugging into several hundred watts of amp and practising scales and speed drills quickly gets the point across.TyPingWe have builders at the moment and they play their music. Our neighbours have been very understanding and have not complained. I’ve taken the attitude that they are only here for a few months and the music is during the day when they are making noise building anyway. I do that think apart from the odd party, inflicting one’s life choices such as music and dogs barking on other people is wrong. The law is pretty clear on this, too. One is entitled to live in one’s house undisturbed by neighbours’ noise.SawdustKidIn this age when Bluetooth headphones are ubiquitous, you should never have to endure other people’s music. I have particularly strong opinions on this as my better half had a nasty accident while sleep-deprived by a neighbour’s music.DrRieuxIt’s unfathomable to me that anyone had a childhood so secure that they can just decide to play their media out loud, knowing full well (yet not being daunted) that strangers and neighbours will judge them negatively for it. That level of self-worth is aspirational.Nadine Andrews, SouthportOf course it is insensitive. Another instance of the “it’s my right to do as I wish” philosophy which holds individual “freedom” as somehow sacrosanct over and above consideration of others. Noise pollution is a significant problem; at best an unthinking intrusion and invasion of privacy. A further example of the “no such thing as society” creed continuing to bear its de-civilising fruit.Rob EyresUnless you are fortunate or wealthy enough to own a back garden large enough to get lost in, the answer must surely be no. With the possible – and occasional – exception of a child’s birthday party. But what do you do about a neighbour who smokes cannabis in their back garden?Ian BrewertonWhy not smash through the hedge and set up your deck chairs on next door’s lawn while you are at it? Headphones were invented so that we could listen to music and not disturb other people.Gillian ParkerDepends whether it’s the neighbourhood party, or some other get-together with intrusive music. We used to have a festival evening garden party in the grounds of the old manor house. They consulted and warned neighbours, and ensured the sound level was reduced as the late hours approached. All OK. Neighbours playing loud music that is drowning out mine, such that I have to resort to headphones, is not.AnonWe bought a house because the garden seemed so lovely. We moved in to find the most disrespectful and hostile neighbours imaginable. They are at the end of the terrace, with no neighbours behind, so it’s just us directly next door (although with the noise they make it must surely be suffered a long way up the terrace). Their music is so loud in the garden it sounds like they are having a party. We’ve asked them to turn it down a couple of times and they clearly couldn’t care less. No remorse for disrupting us, no apology, barely turning it down. Dogs barking loudly in the garden. They just sit among it. Would be nice if they just let us know when they are having bonfires out there so we know to bring our washing in. We barely use the garden we bought the house for. When there’s no noise we hear the birds. What a luxury in a city.Emma StewartFundamentally, this is an issue of civil behaviour. I happen to be a big fan of 20th-century opera, and I like it loud to really reach my amygdala, but I wouldn’t play Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk, Nixon in China or Peter Grimes loudly in my garden because I am fully aware that my tastes are minority tastes and my neighbours are very unlikely to appreciate it. It’s just rude to inflict your tastes on somebody else who has no control over it.Do as you would be done by. If you don’t wish to hear your neighbour playing the final act of Götterdämmerung at full volume in his garden, then you shouldn’t be playing Ibiza dance music. This should be simple.Peter NevilleExplore more on these topicsLife and styleNotes and queriesGardensFamilyHomesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The lounge has striking pink and peach walls, a sideboard painted in cubes of purple and orange, and an olive-green sofa, all of which come together to create a kaleidoscope of colour.On paper, it really shouldn’t work, but the 36-year-old artist and interior designer has more than pulled it off. Thousands of other people seemingly agree. Webster is one of a growing number of small-space interior influencers who has had a boom in interest from young renters and first-time buyers looking to spruce up their compact homes.“People think interior design is just for rich people but it’s very much not. Everyone deserves to have a nice house and you can do things on a much cheaper budget,” said Webster, who runs TikTok and Instagram accounts under the nameGeorgieWebArt.For many young people, the dream of home ownership is an increasingly fleeting one. Recent analysis by the estate agent Hamptons found that 3.4 million under-45s were renters, a figure that has risen by 149,000 in the past two years. In the same period, this cohort has experienced a collective £3.5bn rent increase, which has made saving up for a house deposit even harder.Webster is one of the lucky few young homeowners, having bought her flat in Bristol in 2022. Before that, she had rented numerous properties in the city for almost a decade. “I’ve done all the house shares, from chaotic housemates to amazing ones,” she said.Having a place to call her own has allowed her to express herself with no limitations. Her kitchen is decked from cupboards to floor in peach and her bathroom ceiling is painted sky-blue with white clouds. “Not many landlords would be happy with that,” she said.View image in fullscreenWebster thinks people want more cheerful interiors now that they spend more time at home.Photograph: Adrian Sherratt/The GuardianHer audience, which she said are mostly aged between 24 and 34, comprises of those living in small homes, including renters who face stricter rules on doing up their properties.“There are so many good rental hacks now. You can put peel-back tiles and floors down and you can paint if you’re willing to paint it back after,” she said. Some creators have been particularly creative, withoneusing double-sided tape to easily install boutique wallpaper that can be taken down and put up again in another home.For those who would not dare touch their walls for fear of losing their deposit, Webster has a top tip: “Focus on adding colourful accessories and artwork. Rugs make a massive difference to a room. Go for the biggest rug you can afford because that makes a huge difference.”Webster’s embrace of colour comes amid a shift away from “millennial grey”, a neutral style that was all the rage until the early 2020s. She believes style is not the only reason behind this change.“I partly think this is because the world is quite sad at the moment so if your space is happy, then you feel happier. Plus, everyone is struggling a bit for money, people are spending more time at home,” she said.Other are still stuck with the creative limitations that being a renter brings. Alice Redfearn, 27, has long looked at the high-end interior design featured on Architectural Digest and House & Garden, but living in London, hunkering down in such grand, stately places remains a dream.Nevertheless, the marketing officer, who runs a TikTok account calledMerakialInteriors, has found a way to bridge the gap. “I think you can have an appreciation for a good taste in interior design but also not be there physically and financially,” she said.View image in fullscreenAlice Redfearn gets a lot of her furniture for free on Facebook Marketplace.Photograph: David Levene/The Guardian“I thought other people must also be struggling with this, so I kind of started making videos to give advice.”Originally from County Durham, Redfearn has lived in four properties since moving to the capital. “I‘ve always gone for houses that have good bones, ideally with big windows and tall ceilings,” she said. “Of course, you can only be so picky when you’re looking with friends and you have a small budget.”For Redfearn, patience is key to making your compact space feel homely and unique. “A lot of the furniture that I have is stuff that was free on Facebook Marketplace or found on the street in good condition that could be cleaned and reused.“It’s not a fast process either. The house is not going to look exactly how you want it to look immediately, but eventually it will through slowly accumulating furniture, artwork and other things over time,” she said.She has some foolproof tips to make your temporary abode feel more stately: swap out the curtains – which are often cheap and ill-fitted – for some fancy ones; mix patterns and colours using trinkets and furnishings; and make some clever choices to add some scale.“If you want your deposit back, you probably aren’t going to be hammering nails into walls,” she said. “You can split the space in two halves by having furniture of all the same height – your table, sofa, and TV. Then, you can have a very large blank space on your wall.”Redfearn said it was understandable why some rented properties lack colour and personality. “People are quite hesitant to inject time, resource and money into spaces they may not be staying in long-term because of reasons beyond their control,” she said.But for those who want to turn their homes into havens, despite the limitations, it can be done. “Young people deserve to have a nice home,” says Redfearn.Explore more on these topicsInteriorsHomesHome improvementsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Her commute included taking a bus from Silver Spring, Maryland, to her job in Bethesda. Madison, 25, was working at the time on her license to become a clinical marriage and family therapist, and worked part-time at Instacart to earn extra money. By mid-March 2020, the world had shut down because of the Covid-19 pandemic.“The first two weeks, I was like: ‘OK, this is nice. I don’t have to leave my house. This is a nice little vacation. We’ll probably go back to work in like a month or so,’” Madison remembered thinking.In the following weeks, there were mask mandates and social-distancing requirements in grocery and retail stores. Gathering places – restaurants, shops, clubs and bars – were shut down. Schools were trying to figure out how to provide education online and churches were engaging their parishioners virtually. Zoom replaced in-person meetings and friends connected through FaceTime.The pandemic also laid bare the health and wealth disparities in the US, as Black people were three more times likely to be diagnosed with and die from the coronavirus. They were more likely to be essential workers – those who worked in transportation, healthcare, grocery and retail stores and meat factories – and, as a result, most likely to be exposed to the coronavirus. At the same time, as businesses were forced to close, unemployment increased in Black communities, and Black entrepreneurs, unable to get access to funds set aside for small businesses, struggled.For single Black women, the pandemic was a mix of isolation, loss of community and social connections and a return to the foundation of family. It was also an opportunity to create something new, reflect on the future and tap into the things that mattered most.‘Every single day was the same day’When the world didn’t open up by the end of April, Madison says, she “felt like we were in a movie” and “like life was paused”.“Every single day was the same day. All the days started to blend together,” said Madison. “It became hard to separate work. I was used to going into work, and so while I appreciated not having to get on public transportation, it was a lot to just be in your house all day, every day, and then be scared to be around other people.”Even though she grew up as an only child, Madison admitted, the first few months of the pandemic felt “pretty isolating”. It was hard not being able to go out and do the things she usually did with her single friends. She eventually went home to New York, where she quarantined with her mother and grandmother until the end of June.During the time she was with her family in New York, a racial reckoning occurred in the US after the deaths of Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery and George Floyd. Madison said she had wanted to join the thousands marching and protesting police brutality, but also needed to be safe while living with her mother and grandmother.“So many people died in isolation,” she said, “or, you couldn’t celebrate or honor their lives because people couldn’t have funerals. So I just remember being really, really grateful that, yeah, this sucks, but my life is not being torn apart the way that other people were.”Kailyn Townsend was one of those who couldn’t celebrate or honor her loved ones the way her family had been accustomed to or wanted to during Covid. Her maternal great-grandmother died in April 2020, a month into the pandemic, and a few months later, in June, Townsend’s father’s mother passed away.“I was able to make it to my great-grandmother’s funeral, but it was kind of weird because everybody was socially distanced,” the Memphis native remembered. “We didn’t get to do a lot of the traditional things that we do [at funerals].”Townsend says she didn’t make it back home to her paternal grandmother’s funeral because she missed her flight due to the protests over George Floyd’s murder.“There was a lot going on that year, and I was very isolated,” said Townsend, 30.Exploring creativityTownsend, a graduate of Howard University School of Law, was months into a one-year clerkship at the Small Business Administration when the pandemic hit. After her clerkship ended, it took her several months to find another job.“It took a toll on my self-confidence, on my morale. I ended up filing for unemployment, so I had some money to stay afloat, but it was just a lot of uncertainty and worrying about if I would ever find a job or what that would look like,” Townsend said.But it was during this time that Townsend explored her creative side and nurtured her inner artist. She learned after her grandmothers’ deaths that they had never gotten to pursue their artistic interests: playing the piano and writing poetry. It inspired her to begin writing her own poetry.When Townsend got a new position in the federal government, she realized she was no longer interested in a career in the legal field. But it wasn’t easy to leave.She had moved to the big city from the deep south, gotten a law degree and passed the bar and was expected to climb the corporate ladder and be a big success. But after four years at the job, she moved back to Memphis and is now looking for a position in the creative arts.“The catalyst was the deaths of those matriarchs in my family,” said Townsend. “They left without any or many people knowing that they had an artistic or a creative side. I don’t want to die and people not know the things that I’m interested in or the things that I want to put out into the world.”The deaths of two people close to her during and after the pandemic also prompted Napiya Nubuya to rethink her future and what mattered most to her. The 35-year-old founder and CEO of the Next IT Girl had only been in Atlanta a little more than a year before the pandemic hit.“I loved being downtown. I loved being in Midtown. Loved riding the scooters. I was outside. I was having a good time – trying all the new things, going all the places. I just loved being out in Atlanta. I was excited to be in this new city,” said Nubuya, who is from Charleston, South Carolina. She described the beginning of the pandemic as a loss of freedom. “I think as soon as the pandemic had happened, I was just like: ‘What do I do? What is life now like?’ I was also trying to find my community, my tribe before the pandemic.”Nubuya’s employer had cut her salary 25% because of the uncertainty of the pandemic. At the same time, her rent increased by hundreds of dollars. She didn’t have friends nearby and she missed home. Eventually, the IT professional got a new job, but it required her to work long hours as technology skills became more in demand during the pandemic.“I took a very hard hit in my work-life balance. I was averaging probably 50 hours a week,” remembered Nubuya. “The mental strain was starting to weigh on me.”So Nubuya, who turned 30 just a few months into the pandemic, relocated back to South Carolina in the fall of 2020, where she had family and community. She used the opportunity of social distancing, office closures and remote work to travel, visiting places such as Arizona, New Mexico, Tanzania and Kenya.“I was traveling all the places that were on my bucket list because I was like: ‘I’ll never get this time back again.’ I felt like this was my Eat, Pray, Love,” she said, referring to the 2006 memoir by Elizabeth Gilbert about traveling through Italy, India and Indonesia after a difficult divorce, which was adapted into a film in 2010. Nubuya said: “I had the independence to create the spaces and opportunities I wanted to be in. It was doing what I wanted, when I wanted, going to places, waking up late, eating what I wanted. There was this sense of independence.”In December 2022, Nubuya took a leave from work to help care for her father, who had stage four metastatic stomach cancer. He died in January 2023. Months before learning of her father’s diagnosis, Nubuya had been at the side of a good friend and member of her non-profit who was also struggling through a cancer battle; she died in May 2022.Burned out, Nubuya said, she couldn’t go back to work in a corporate environment. Instead, she reluctantly stepped into a leadership role at the non-profit she had founded in 2015, Next IT Girl, which focuses on introducing girls of color to the IT profession. Nubuya said she had never imagined that she would be an entrepreneur. She was content with “getting my check every two weeks, my benefits”. But she looks back now and realizes that she had been running from her calling.While the pandemic was one of the scariest times in history, the step away from “normal” life gave some an opportunity to reflect and reconnect, travel, write books and explore new ideas. Nubuya’s burnout and personal tragedies during the pandemic gave her the push to leave corporate America. The isolation of the pandemic helped Townsend leave an unfulfilling career in the legal field. And the pandemic gave Jordan Madison the time and space to start her own virtual mental health practice (Therapy Is My JAM).“The pandemic taught me the importance of valuing community. Isolation is deteriorating to your mind, to your body, to your work,” Nubuya said. “The pandemic taught me, no regrets. Do what you feel, and take chances. You can get back up, but don’t take your last breath with any regrets.”"

Such ingratitude,” he wrote on his X social media platform amid an ongoing feud with Donald Trump.When rightwing commentator Laura Loomer wrote that Republicans on Capitol Hill had been discussing whom to side with in the inter-party feud, Musk replied with a nod toward the long tail of his influence. “Oh and some food for thought as they ponder this question: Trump has 3.5 years left as President, but I will be around for 40+ years … ,” Musk wrote on X.Billionaires in the US often seek to influence politics in big and small ways, throwing their money and influence around to extract what they want from the government. But few are as explicit and influential as Musk has proven in the past year – and it’s showing just how transactional and broken US governance has become.The Trump-Musk battle exemplifies the post-Citizens United picture of US politics: the world’s richest person paid handsomely to elect his favored candidate, then took a formal, if temporary, role with a new governmental initiative created for him that focused on dismantling parts of the government he didn’t like.We’re sitting ringside to a fight between the mega-rich president and the far richer Republican donor to see who can cut more services from the poor. As onesatirical websiteput it: “Aw! These Billionaires Are Fighting Over How Much Money to Steal From Poor People.”Fifteen years ago, the US supreme court ruled that corporations and outside groups could spend as much as they wanted on elections. In thatruling, conservative justice Anthony Kennedy said: “The appearance of influence or access, furthermore, will not cause the electorate to lose faith in our democracy.”In the years since, it’s become clear that these infusions of wealth have eroded democracy, with Musk’s ostentatious example accelerating an already out-of-control level of money in politics. Muskspentnearly $300m to elect Trump in 2024. It’s the billionaire’s government now.“Fifteen years after that decision, we’re seeing the full culmination of living under a Citizens United world – where it’s not just elections that are for sale, but it’s that our entire government, and the apparatus of our government, is up for sale,” Tiffany Muller, the president of End Citizens United,told the Bulwark earlier this year.Musk isn’t alone here:in races up and down the ballot, ultra-rich donors are throwing around their cash to get their favored candidates elected. This is the standard state of play for politics in the US now, in both political parties. Bernie Sanders confronted Democrats at their convention last year to say: “Billionaires in both parties should not be able to buy elections, including primary elections.”Earlier this year, Musk poured big money into a Wisconsin judicial election, but lost to the Democratic candidate. And he’ssentsmall-dollar donations to Republicans who wanted to go after judges who ruled against the Trump administration. The threat of his money, even if it is uneven and has an inconsistent success record, looms large for both political parties.But, by virtue of his unelected role, Musk couldn’t do as much as he wanted to stop Trump’s signature spending bill – or so it seems so far. Trump’s “big, beautiful bill” didn’t cut enough spending or favor Musk enough or otherwise meet his litmus test for a budget. And when the administration stopped working for him, he turned on it, blazing out the door in a chaotic fashion.It’s a fitting coda to the uneasy alliance between Trump and Musk that started with a warm embrace and front-row status for the ultra-wealthy when Trump took office. The fact that Musk holds such sway over the budget process is in itself corruption. Trump has said Musk knew what was in the bill, the undertone being that the administration sought his approval before the public explosion.Musk embraced a brawling style of political spending that is rare among the uber-wealthy, who tend to let their money speak louder than their public words. One expert in philanthropypreviously told the GuardianMusk stood out because of his “complete eschewal of discretion as a mode of political engagement”.Musk is now rallying his followers on X to reach out to their members of Congress and kill the bill, a quest that could be successful, depending on how Republican lawmakers shake out when they’re forced to decide between their ideologue president and a megadonor known for his vindictiveness.In rightwing media, the feud has created a chasm.On Breitbart, one commentator noted how Trump was “sticking his finger in the eye of his biggest donor and that never happens”. Inthe American Spectator, one writer opined that Musk did not elect Trump: “the American people did.” But in the pages ofthe Washington Examiner, Musk’s stance on the bill was praised because Trump’s budget plan “deserves to die”.“I don’t mind Elon turning against me, but he should have done so months ago,” Trump wrote to cap off a series of posts and public comments about Musk. Musk has “lost his mind”, the presidentsaidin a TV interview Friday.So far, Republican officials are lining up behind Trump. “President Trump has done more than any person in my lifetime to earn the trust of the movement he leads,” JD Vance said.If Musk ultimately loses, he could take his money and run elsewhere. He floated the idea of creating a third political party, a prospect that’s been tried many times before but without the wealth infusion and bully pulpit he’d offer to the cause. Democrats, themselves quite reliant on rich donors, will lobby for him to switch sides. The Democratic representativeRo Khannasuggestedthe party should “be in a dialogue” with Musk.Although Khanna, who represents Silicon Valley and has called for the left to embrace economic populism, saw intense backlash against his comments from his party, he doubled down.“If Biden had a big supporter criticize him, Trump would have hugged him the next day,” he wrote on X. “When we refused to meet with @RobertKennedyJr, Trump embraced him & won. We can be the party of sanctimonious lectures, or the party of FDR that knows how to win & build a progressive majority.”Explore more on these topicsElon MuskTrump administrationUS politicsRepublicansanalysisShareReuse this content"

We do so as fellow experienced professionals and potential patients. There was a genuine case that pay for resident doctors had fallen behind, but a 22% increase last year and an above-inflation offer this year seems to us to go a long way to addressing that. It’s certainly far more than many of our colleagues, other professional groups and patients are getting, and it cannot have been easy to persuade the Treasury in such resource-constrained times.There remain significant problems around working conditions and training. They need firm resolution but this will not be achieved through strikes.We have witnessed many governments,NHSrestructures and accompanying frustrations for our work. This has never compromised, and should never compromise, the needs and care of people who seek our help. That is why we all go into this profession. A strike now would harm patients and diminish the cause of these doctors. The calls to strike misjudge the mood in the country. There is no spare money – this is a futile gesture, guiding people into a maze without a thread.In our view, the NHS is at a more perilous state than at any time in our careers. A doctors’ strike would further diminish the ability of the NHS to deliver, and play into the hands of those who don’t believe in an NHS that is publicly funded and based on need not want. We urge resident doctors to keep to the spirit of the Hippocratic oath – vote for the NHS and vote no to strike action.John OldhamFormernationalclinicallead,quality and productivity,Clare GeradaGP and former chair Royal College of General Practitioners,David Colin-ThomeFormer GP and national clinical director,Prof James KingslandUniversity of Central Lancashire,Dr Fiona CornishGP, Cambridge,Prof John AshtonFormerregional director of public health for north-west England and director public healthHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Plus a letter fromLaura WilloughbySun 8 Jun 2025 12.03 EDTLast modified on Sun 8 Jun 2025 21.30 EDTShareYou are right to argue that rising alcohol harm must be addressed in the government’s 10-year health plan (The Guardian view on alcohol and public health: the drinks industry must not control the narrative, 1 June). If ministers are “staking their reputation on economic growth”, they need to deal head-on with one of the biggest drivers of premature death and lost productivity, while ignoring spurious claims made by alcohol companies whose profits have for too long trumped public health.Alcohol harm costs England at least £27bn a year – almost double what the Treasury collects in alcohol duty. These harms aren’t incidental to the alcohol market; they are intrinsic to it. While the industry promotes “moderate drinking”,evidence showsthat its profits and growth depend on the heaviest drinkers. It’s no coincidence thatDiageo’s CEO recentlydescribed moderation as the industry’s “biggest disrupter”.Policies that reduce alcohol consumption are consistently shown to be sound investments, recommended by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, the World Bank and the WorldHealthOrganization. In Scotland, the introduction of minimum unit pricing (MUP) led to a 13% drop in alcohol-specific deaths and a 4% fall in hospital admissions. If adopted in England, MUP could reduce premature mortality while saving the NHS millions and help create a healthier workforce.England urgently needs a national alcohol strategy. Bold, evidence-based measures like MUP must be at its core, with commercial vested-interest groups kept at the margins.Dr Katherine SeveriChief executive, Institute of Alcohol StudiesYour editorial reflects the serious concerns that we at WorldCancerResearch Fund and many other organisations have around the ineffectiveness of England’s alcohol regulation. The evidence shows that there is no safe level of alcohol consumption when it comes to cancer risk. And there are around 17,000 alcohol-related cancer cases in the UK every year, as well as 200 other associated health conditions caused by alcohol.In ourCancer Prevention Action Week (23-29 June), we will showcase polling that highlights the chasm between public perception about alcohol and cancer risks. We want the public to have correct health information at their disposal so they can understand their cancer risks and make informed choices. Now is the time for direct action. The UK government urgently needs to join the dots on regulation around alcohol marketing and labelling.We urge members of the public to do their part andsign our petitionto advocate with us for better regulation in England.Dr Giota MitrouExecutive director of research and policy, World Cancer Research FundNearly half of UK adults now drink alcohol-free products, and our research shows that 68% of them use these drinks to cut down on alcohol. But despite this momentum, outdated labelling rules are holding people back.For over a decade, governments have delayed a straightforward change: allowing drinks at or below 0.5% ABV to be labelled “alcohol-free”. This is already the international standard and reflects the reality – drinks at this level contain no more alcohol than a ripe banana, sourdough bread or even some soft drinks. Yet UK producers are still forced to use the term “low alcohol” for these drinks, confusing consumers and deterring many from trying them.Laura WilloughbyCo-founder, Club SodaHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

First, that sometimes another member of the ill-assorted international crew would ask a question you could never have brought yourself to pose (“So, Nicole Kidman, why did you and Tom Cruise not have children of your own?”). Second, that they could occasionally throw up a good experience, as in Venice, whenDonald Sutherlandswept the entire group up to his hotel bedroom, to sprawl on the rumpled sheets nibbling his favourite parmesan and pears.Third, that there could have been no better training for my present role as a historical biographer, assembling profiles of celebrities who, being on average some 400 years dead, are in no position to answer any questions at all.Sarah GristwoodDeal, KentHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

The head of the national police, Carlos Fernando Triana, said the suspect was injured in the struggle and was receiving treatment.Two other people – a man and a woman – were also wounded, and a Glock-style pistol was seized.The motive for the attack is not yet known, but Colombia’s defence minister, Pedro Arnulfo Sánchez, vowed that the military, police and intelligence services would deploy all their capabilities to find out what happened. Sánchez also offered a 3bn peso (£540,000) reward for information leading to the identification and capture of those responsible for the attack.Murder of Colombian model sparks outrage over rising femicidesRead morePetro offered his sympathies to Uribe’s family and said Colombia was thinking of him.“I hope Miguel Uribe survives,” said the president. “That’s what I want above all else and that’s what society should feel as we join our hearts and our energy so that he’ll be OK.”Petro later confirmed in a speech on Saturday night that the person arrested was a minor and that the investigation would focus on finding who had ordered the attack.“For now, there is nothing more than hypothesis,” he said, adding that failures in security protocols would also be looked into.The Spanish government condemned the assassination attempt. “Violence has no place in our societies,” it said. “Spain sends its wishes for a speedy recovery to the victim, to all his family and friends, and to the Colombian people.”The US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, also condemned the attack, but said it was the result of what he termed “violent leftist rhetoric coming from the highest levels of the Colombian government”.Petro and Donald Trump have recently clashed over theUS migrant deportation flights that pushed the two countries to the brink of a trade war.Uribe is from a prominent family. His grandfather, Julio César Turbay Ayala, served as Colombia’s president from 1978 to 1982, his father was a businessman and union leader and his mother, the journalist Diana Turbay, was killed in a rescue operation after being kidnapped in 1990 by an armed group under the command of the cartel leader Pablo Escobar.

Driving up to the building, there are already signs to the arrivals and departures area.View image in fullscreenThe new international terminal will one day service millions of passengers.Photograph: Western Sydney International airportHowever, there’s plenty still to be done.While ride-share pickup points have been established, getting an Uber to the terminal is impossible, in large part because roads haven’t been named yet.Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailThe existing roads to the airport via the town of Luddenham feel semi-rural, passing homesteads, paddocks and plenty of cows, before the environment quickly shifts to hi-vis and fresh asphalt of roads not yet recognised on Google Maps.But for now, it’s just construction workers who have learned the daily commute travelling to the airport.Perfecting the experience of driving to the airport 44km west of Sydney’s eastern CBD will be crucial – the airport is scheduled to open in December 2026, before the dedicated Metro rail link, which has been delayed, potentially until up to a year later.‘Mini-city’: meet the 30,000 workers who power Australia’s busiest airport every dayRead moreIt’s one of many of the logistical hurdles the government-owned airport faces on its home stretch, before bringing 24-hour commercial aviation to Sydney and shaking up a core dynamic that has hamstrung Australian aviation.Dropped suitcase drills and a digital aerodromeStanding on the freshly laid runway, the airport CEO Simon Hickey last week said most of the construction of the airport itself had now been completed. Western Sydney International was on budget and on track to open by the end of 2026, he said.Most of the task ahead lies in bolstering roads on the so-called “land side” – as opposed to the airfield – but most of the works will be filling out the rest of the airport precinct, which includes a business park, cargo area and the broader Bradfield city being planned by government authorities.One thing that does not need to be built is an air traffic control tower.The airport will be Australia’s first operated as a “digital aerodrome” – thanks to more than 20 high-resolution cameras broadcasting the airport and immediate airspace in real time to a centralised control room off-site – as part of plans by Airservices Australia, the government body responsible for managing airspace.View image in fullscreenAn aerial view of the airport, which is due to be finished in 2026Some things, however, cannot be done remotely. Airservices – which is also tasked with providing specialist aviation firefighting services to all major airports – will soon build its fire station there.While major construction works are nearing completion, Hickey said efforts were shifting to a testing regime, which will include welcoming progressively larger aircraft, as well as drills mimicking everyday airport scenarios.These drills will canvass mundane occurrences, such as staff responding to deliberately staged incidents such as dropped suitcases or injuries, with hired staff posing as travellers.The drills will also include crisis simulations, to stress test how the airport’s infrastructure and staff respond to incidents such as security threats or cyber-attacks.Wooing airlinesThe other crucial element will be securing airlines to fly to the airport.So far, Qantas, its budget carrier Jetstar, andSingaporeAirlines have signed up. Hickey said the airline had been in discussion with more than 30 airlines.View image in fullscreenThe new airport’s 3.7km runway is strong enough to accommodate A380 and Boeing 747-8 jumbos.Photograph: Western Sydney International airportWhile more airlines are expected to announce services to WSI soon, Hickey last week was coy as to whether a lack of rail connection at the initial opening, and distance from central Sydney, was proving a sticking point in attempts to woo more global carriers.“We’ve got great connectivity from day one,” Hickey said, talking up the M12 motorway which allows travel to Sydney’s eastern CBD “without going through one set of traffic lights”.“[There are] 2.5 million people in western Sydney. It’s one of the most vibrant communities in Australia. It’s one of the fastest-growing communities in Australia … So actually, airlines recognise that this is a great place to be with a great catchment,” Hickey said.View image in fullscreenWhere Sydney airport is hampered by an 11pm curfew, Western Sydney airport will run 24 hours a dayIn the early months of operating, operations are expected to be small, before gradually ramping up. Before the rail connection opens, many in the industry expect the airport to be mostly popular with western Sydney locals, especially those looking to avoid long trips and toll spends getting to the existing Kingsford Smith airport in Mascot.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It began hosting passenger services with Jetstar in 2004, but repeated attempts to lure international airlines have not lasted.Conversely, Western Sydney airport is being master-planned as a primarily passenger airport with an accompanying CBD to serve an area already looking for alternatives to the long commute to the eastern part of the city.Additionally, the 24-hour operations at WSI are set to trigger a dramatic shake-up of Australian aviation.2:10Quieter, more space and power points: how do the new intercity trains in NSW stack up? – videoCurrently, Sydney’s existing Kingsford Smith airport ishamstrung by strict movement limits of 80 takeoffs and landings – known as slots– in any one hour, plus an 11pm-6am curfew, to curb noise pollution for residents.The scarcity of slots in Sydney, particularly in peak travel times, has been highlighted as a key barrier to new entrant airlines establishing a foothold to compete withQantasgroup and Virgin.While its flight paths will be slightly tweaked at night, WSI will operate at all hours, with careful planning to ensure comparatively less noise for residents compared with the city’s eastern airport.Many in the industry are hopeful that beyond allowing for cheaper and more convenient flights for those willing to travel during the night, less constrained slots could allow new airlines to form a base in Sydney and meaningfully compete with established carriers.One in 10 flights between Sydney and Melbourne are cancelled. Is slot hoarding to blame?Read more“Late-night departure capacity, for instance, could allow Singapore Airlines business travellers to finish a full day’s work in Sydney, take an overnight flight and arrive in Singapore before their first morning meeting the very next day,” Hickey has said.Competition among airports over the prices they charge for access and retail rents could also drive prices lower for business which could flow on to customers, a dynamic seen in European countries where competition from secondary airports allow for more carriers and cheaper average air fares.WSI will initially operate with just one runway, capable of handling up to 10 million passengers a year, but with growth plans to allow for a second runway to be built.Tens of thousands of jobs will be directly or indirectly supported by the airport and precinct.There are plans for WSI to eventually become Sydney’s biggest international airport, to handle more than 80 million annual passengers, similar to the load handled by London’s Heathrow.However, in the short term, Sydney’s Kingsford Smith is expected to remain dominant, with demand at Western Sydney to take time to form.This has been seen in Qantas’s planning, with the airlineconfirming to Australian Aviationthat when the airport opens it will operate services with QantasLink, its regional brand which has smaller aircraft.For now, Catherine King, the transport minister, is optimistic the airport will grow, not cannibalise, Sydney’s air travel market, and help make western Sydney a destination instead of an appendage.“Each [airport] will operate in their own markets. I’m sure they’ll work competitively with and against each other as well,” King said.Explore more on these topicsSydneyTransportAirline industryQantasSingaporeanalysisShareReuse this content"

They said his driving licence had been suspended for 120 days and that he had been issued a fine of 1,822 lei (£305).Tate confirmed some of the details in a post on X, but denied speeding, claiming the police officer’s radar gun must have been “calibrated incorrectly”.“This morning at 6:15am, on a completely empty mountain pass in the middle of the country, I was stopped by police and accused of speeding,” he said. “They said I was driving 197 [sic] on a 40 [sic] in one of my 100 sports cars – and although there was nobody around – my licence must be suspended for 4 months and I would have the [sic] pay the crippling fine of 300 usd [sic]. I can NOT afford this bill. I explained to the officer that his Radar gun must be calibrated incorrectly because I would never do this.”Tate described the allegation that he was speeding as “grossly false” and said he looked forward to explaining himself when he appeared in court on Monday.Andrew and Tristan Tate are facing prosecution in Romania over allegations of trafficking minors, sexual intercourse with a minor and money laundering. A separate case against them, in which they are accused of human trafficking and forming a criminal gang to sexually exploit women, has been sent back to prosecutors. They deny the charges.UK prosecutors also recently confirmed charges against the pair. Andrew Tate faces 10 charges including rape, actual bodily harm, human trafficking and controlling prostitution for gain – charges connected to three alleged victims.Tristan Tate faces 11 charges including rape, actual bodily harm and human trafficking – charges connected to one alleged victim.An international arrest warrant was issued by Bedfordshire police for the siblings over the allegations, dating back to between 2012 and 2015, which they deny.The pair are due to be extradited to the UK after the conclusion of proceedings in Romania.Explore more on these topicsAndrew TateRomaniaEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

It also puts all the other steps in the industry and the value chain in danger.”She said Europe must step in to save the sector because it was fundamental for military security and was a large employer, and if it failed, the continent would be left reliant on the US and China for a key manufacturing material.There is also the growing problem of cheap Chinese steel imports, something the European Commission has in its sights in talks with Beijing over its dumping of goods in the EU, which are also covering the oversupply of cars andfast fashion. Chinese steel imports soared by 36% in the first quarter of 2025, according to Eurostat.According to Henne, Russian steel is still appearing on the market, at a rate of 3m-4m tonnes a year, just short of the 3.8m tonnes the EU as a whole exports to the US.The US doubling of the tariff on steel and aluminium importsdoes not apply to the UK, which will continue to pay 25% until 9 July and is racing to implement the terms of a bilateral dealstruck last monththat would take the rate down to zero.Ministers are working to ensure the UK’s biggest player in the sector, Tata Steel,is not excluded from the dealbecause it has begun importing semi-finished products from India and Europe since closing its blast furnace in south Wales last year. This could breach US rules that require all steel to be “melted and poured” in the country from which it is imported.US representatives also have concerns that British Steel, which is owned by China’s Jingye group, could be used as a “back door” to bring in Chinese products. The UK government used emergency legislation totake control of the company’s plant in Scunthorpe, and according to the Sunday Times, ministers now face a standoff with Jingye over a £1bn-plus compensation claim to get it to relinquish its interest.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

So the cost of manufacturing has gone up,” she said.The impact “is a lesson that the US has to learn, unfortunately, I believe, the hard way,” she said. “What they are doing is actually limiting their own growth potential.”In its second-quarter outlook report issued last Thursday, Eurofer, the EU steel trade association, said the US tariffs had dealt “a severe blow” to recovery expectations. It has called on the EU to bring in emergency measures to help save the industry.“There is a lot that we can do to save the steel industry,” said Henne, calling on the European Commission to do more to ensure hydrogen comes on stream at a competitive price to reduce the reliance on oil- and gas-fuelled furnaces.“Reducing the tariffs would be a good thing, but equally important for us is competitive energy pricing,” she said.Explore more on these topicsSteel industryEuropeEnergy industryTrump tariffsTariffsnewsShareReuse this content"

Often given as a wedding present, these vases were usually passed down as family heirlooms, revealing the accessibility of art deco works, she says, gesturing to the glass cabinet beside her. “If you were a collector, you could find works that cost a fortune, but these pieces were destined for people of more modest means for very reasonable prices.”Art deco was the first artistic movement that sought to appeal to a wider public beyond the elites, say the organisers of a new exhibition dedicated to the artistic movement of the interwar years, co-curated by Dubois, the president of the Brussels Art Deco Society.The exhibition, which opened this month at the BELvue museum in Brussels, brings together for the first time works owned by the King Baudouin Foundation, which was founded through a donation from the late Belgian monarch in 1976. It is part of the Belgian capital’s year-long celebration of art deco – events and exhibitions torecognise and market Brusselsas a centre for the artistic movement known for its geometric designs, exotic motifs and opulent materials.View image in fullscreenTête de Femme by Oscar Jespers.Photograph: Benjamin De Vuyst/Galerie De VuystThrough this modest exhibition of sculptures, vases, furniture and everyday artworks, the museum aims to chart the evolution of art deco: from luxurious hand-crafted goods for the few, to mass-produced objects aimed at middle-class consumers around the world. “It’s the first style that spread in all layers of society, from the richest to the poor people,” says Werner Adriaenssens, another co-curator and an art history professor at the Free University of Brussels.During the interwar years, brightly coloured geometric-patterned ceramic tiles were exported from Belgium’s industrial heartlands all around the world. Ships left the port of Antwerp laden with tiles destined for kitchens, bathrooms and shops.Art deco was the first global style. From Paris, often credited as the birthplace of the movement, it spread to New York, Soviet Moscow, Shanghai, Beirut and Brussels.Many of the “wedding gift” vases were designed in the southern Belgium town of La Louvière by the Franco-Belgian artist Charles Catteau, who oversaw production of decorative ceramics at Boch Frères during the interwar years. The company was a Belgian offshoot of the Franco-Luxembourgish ceramics dynasty, founded 14 years after the Belgian revolution of 1830. By 1935 it employed 1,350 people. Catteau did not design all the pieces but supervised the models, colours and finish of the glazes. His signature was stamped on every piece, a kind of trademark.As art met commerce, governments realised the creative sector had economic weight. Economic considerations led Belgium’s government to participate in the International Exhibition of Modern Decorative and Industrial Arts in Paris in 1925, a show seen as the founding moment of the art deco movement, although almost no one used that term until decades later. “The only reason to participate for Belgium in 25 was that the government was convinced that the decorative hearts had an economic impact,” Adriaenssens said.View image in fullscreenPerle Fine by Oscar Jespers.Photograph: De VuystThat Paris exhibition in 1925 heralded a shift from art nouveau of the prewar years, especially in the depiction of women. No longer the dreamy feminine ideal of art nouveau, women in art deco were often elegant, stylised and powerful. Emblematic of the shift is a 1925 sculpture by the Flemish artist Oscar Jespers: influenced by cubism, the workFine Pearlshows a female face that is abstract, modern, ghost-like.Catteau’s vases reflect cubist influences, as well as a fascination with exotic birds and animals, probably inspired bythe Belgian Congo. According to Adriaenssens, art deco artists were the first to do market research. “They were really searching, what does the middle class want?” So they did not shy away from older themes, such as ancient Greek-inspired pottery, but with modern geometric shapes and glazes.Art nouveau, as the name implies, wanted to be new, Adriaenssens observed. “Art deco has not that aspiration to be completely new, but to be modern.”Explore more on these topicsArt and designCeramicsBelgiumEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Our soldiers are courageously and professionally holding their section of the front, disrupting the occupier’s plans. This work does not stop for a minute.”The advance of Russian forces into the industrial region of Dnipropetrovsk for the first time would be a symbolic and strategic setback for Kyiv after the morale-boosting results of Operation Spiderweb, in which its drones attacked some of the Kremlin’s nuclear-capable bombers deep inside Russia.The Kremlin claimed in 2022 to have annexed the Donetsk, Kherson, Luhansk and Zaporizhzhia regions despite not having complete control of them. Dnipro, the administrative capital of Dnipropetrovsk, has been under near constant fire since the invasion began.Independent monitors said there was also evidence that Russia was advancing on the city of Kostyantynivka, in the Donetsk region, from several directions. The city has been a key logistical hub for Ukraine’s forces since February 2022 when Putin launched his full-scale invasion.A Ukrainian military spokesperson, Dmytro Zaporozhets, confirmed that Russian forces were trying to “build a bridgehead for an attack” on Kostyantynivka.Ukraine’s cities are also bracing for fresh night-time missile and drone attacks after US officials said they did not believe Russia had fully responded to Monday’s Operation Spiderweb, when 117 drones struck aircraft inside Russia.Russia launched one of its most intense aerial barrages of the war on Thursday night and into the early hours of Friday morning, firing 452 drones and 45 missiles at Ukrainian cities and infrastructure, but further plans were believed to be in the making.One US official told Reuters that while the timing remained unclear, a retaliatory strike could be expected in the coming days and was likely to be “asymmetrical”.With the war heating up, even the small progress made in the talks in Istanbul between the warring parties appeared at risk of unravelling. A large-scale exchange of prisoners and bodies of the dead due to be held on Monday seemed in doubt after each side accused the other of breaking the terms of the agreement.Kyiv and Moscow agreed to release all wounded soldiers and those under 25, equating to more than 1,000 people from each side. Russia said it would also hand back the remains of 6,000 killed Ukrainian soldiers.The Kremlin accused Ukraine of not turning up to collect the bodies already at the border and prevaricating over Monday’s prisoner exchange. Russian officials said they would continue to deliver further bodies to the border.Ukrainian officials accused Russia of playing “dirty games” and not sticking to the agreed parameters for the exchange by including personnel in a list of prisoners they wished recovered who were not eligible.“The Ukrainian side has unexpectedly postponed for an indefinite period both the acceptance of the bodies and the exchange of prisoners of war,” Russia’s chief negotiator, Vladimir Medinsky, said on social media.Ukraine’s Coordination Headquarters for the Treatment of Prisoners of War said no date had been set for the prisoner exchange.They said: “Unfortunately, instead of constructive dialogue, we are again faced with manipulations. We call on the Russian side to stop playing dirty games and return to constructive work to bring people back to both sides and to clearly implement the agreement in the coming days”.Explore more on these topicsUkraineRussiaEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Organisers put the attendance at 100,000.Sánchez’s government and his inner circle have faced a series of corruption allegations over the past year. Pressure on his Spanish Socialist Workers’ party (PSOE) has increased over recent days after a former member of the party was accused of trying to wage a smear campaign against the Guardia Civil police unit investigating the prime minister’s wife, Begoña Gómez, his brother, David Sánchez, and the former transport minister José Luis Ábalos.Leire Díaz, who resigned from the PSOE after recordings were leaked in which she appeared to offer judicial leniency in return for compromising information on senior members of the unit, has denied working on behalf of the prime minister or the party, saying she was researching a book on corruption.As demonstrators congregated in the midday heat of the Plaza de España, carrying placards bearing messages such as “Sánchez traitor” and “government resign”, the PP’s leader, Alberto Núñez Feijóo, renewed his call for a snap election.View image in fullscreenThe People’s party leader, Alberto Núñez Feijóo, speaking in the Plaza de España.Photograph: Thomas Coex/AFP/Getty Images“Spain needs a revolution of decency and freedom – and we will lead that revolution from the streets and at the ballot boxes,” he told the crowd. “Mr Sánchez, stop hiding, stop lying and stop running.Spainknows only too well who you are and what you have done. Yield to democracy. Call an election: we want one now because no one voted for this, not even your supporters.”The prime minister has accused his political and media opponents of conducting a“harassment and bullying operation”against him and his wife, arguing that false allegations levelled at her are designed to bring about his “personal and political collapse”.Spain’s socialist leader has defied expectations. Are there lessons for Starmer?Read moreGómez is being investigated for alleged corruption and influence peddling after a complaint by the pressure group Manos Limpias (Clean Hands), a self-styled trade union with far-right links that has a long history of using the courts to pursue political targets. Manos Limpias hasaccused Gómez of using her influenceas the wife of the prime minister to secure sponsors for a university master’s degree course that she ran. Sánchez has described the case against his wife as baseless and “an ugly fit-up driven by the far-right groups behind the complaint”.Meanwhile, David Sánchez is facing trial over allegations of influence peddling and other offences in a case that also began with accusations from Manos Limpias and other groups. He denies the charges.Sánchez’s administration has also been facing questions since it emerged in February last year that an assistant to Ábalos, once a close ally and confidant of the prime minister, had been arrested on suspicion of taking payments to facilitate contracts for face masks during the coronavirus pandemic.Meanwhile, the PP, which wasousted from governmentseven years ago after a series of corruption scandals, is itself under scrutiny on several fronts, not least over itshandling of the deadly floodslast year in Valencia, one of the regions it governs.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

She has also been forced to defend herrelationship with her partner, Alberto González Amador, after judges began investigating his business dealings.González Amador is under investigation for a variety of alleged offences and has been charged with two counts of tax fraud and one of document forgery in connection to fees he charged a company that imported face masks during the pandemic. Ayuso has said her partner has been targeted by “all the powers of the state” purely because of his relationship with her, while a member of her administration recently said the “presumption of innocence should be respected”.The government attempted to play down the protests, dismissing them as a sign of the PP’s desperation.Spain’s pugnacious transport minister, Óscar Puente, posted aerial pictures showing the plaza far from full, while the digital transformation minister, Óscar López, said the protest had been called to distract attention from Feijóo’s underperforming leadership and from Ayuso’s problems.“They’re really nervous,” López wrote on X. “Because they’ve filled the Plaza de España with insults but not with people … While they sling mud, we move forwards.”Explore more on these topicsSpainPedro SánchezEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Israel will act against any attempt to break the blockade or to assist terrorist organisations – by sea, by air, and by land.”Thunberg, who has said she is taking part in the mission “because the moment we stop trying is when we lose our humanity”, has rejected previous Israeli accusations of antisemitism.In the early hours of Monday, an alarm was briefly sounded on the vessel, named Madleen, amid concerns about a possible interception.The Freedom Flotilla Coalition (FFC), the activist group operating the vessel, posted on Telegram a voice memo from Thiago Avila, one of the activists onboard, saying “we have been surrounded by many lights all at once; they were circling our boat but in the end they kept going their own way.”On board the vessel alongside Thunberg are 10 other activists from Germany, France, Brazil, Turkey, Sweden, Spain and the Netherlands. They include Rima Hassan, a French member of the European parliament of Palestinian descent who has been barred from entering Israel.Responding to Katz on Sunday, they said: “The statement by Israel’s defence minister is yet another example of Israel threatening the unlawful use of force against civilians – and attempting to justify that violence with smears.“We will not be intimidated,” it added. “The world is watching.”As of Sunday evening, the Madleen, which left the port of Catania in Sicily, southernItaly, on 1 June, was approximately 160 nautical miles from Gaza.View image in fullscreenIsrael Katz, Israel’s defence minister labelled the flotilla ‘antisemitic’.Photograph: AP“We are monitoring the situation closely,” the FFC said. “We remain calm, resolute, and prepared for the possibility of an Israeli attack. We reiterate our call to world governments to demand that Israel stand down. Israel has no right to obstruct our effort to reach Gaza.”Israel’s blockade on Gaza has been in place for years, even before the Israel-Hamas war that erupted in October 2023 after the Hamas attacks on Israel in which 1,200 people, mostly civilians, were killed and 251 people were taken hostage.It was slightly eased in mid-May after nearly three months, allowing a limited amount of humanitarian aid into the territory. But malnutrition is spreading, medics and aid workers have warned, with UN officials describing Gaza as “the hungriest place on Earth”.Katz said on Sunday that the blockade was essential to Israel’s national security as it seeks to destroy Hamas. “The State of Israel will not allow anyone to break the naval blockade on Gaza, whose primary purpose is to prevent the transfer of weapons to Hamas,” he said.‘These are traps set for the people’: the story of a mother shot dead searching for food in GazaRead moreMore than 54,000 Palestinians have died during Israel’s assault, according to Gaza health authorities, with much of the territory reduced to rubble.Israel’s plan to concentrate food delivery in hubs guarded by private security contractors and the Israeli military and provided by the US-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) has proved to be chaotic and dangerous, critics say.At leastfour people were killedand others wounded by Israeli fire on Sunday, about a kilometre from a food distribution point in Gaza, Palestinian medics and officials said. The deaths bring the number of people who have been killed while trying to find food in Gazasince 27 May, when GHF became responsible for civilian food provision, to 110. More than 1,000 have been injured.Israel said it was expecting to intercept the flotilla in the next 48 hours.Before leaving Sicily on board the Madleen, which is carrying a symbolic amount of rice and infant formula, Thunberg told reporters: “We are doing this because, no matter what odds we are against, we have to keep trying. Because the moment we stop trying is when we lose our humanity. And, no matter how dangerous this mission is, it’s not even near as dangerous as the silence of the entire world in the face of the livestreamed genocide.”Israel has denied any accusations of genocide.View image in fullscreenGreta Thunberg says she took part in the mission ‘because the moment we stop trying is when we lose our humanity’.Photograph: Alessio Mamo/The GuardianThunberg, who became an internationally famous climate activist after organising protests in her native Sweden, had been due to board a previous Freedom Flotilla ship, the Conscience,last month.

Al-Awda hospital said it had received the body of a 42-year-old man, as well as 29 people who had been injured near another GHF distribution point.The Reuters news agency reported that four people had been killed by the Israeli fire, while the Associated Press put the death toll at “at least” five.The deaths bring the number of people who have been killed while trying to find food in Gaza since 27 May, when GHF became responsible for civilian food provision, to 110. More than 1,000 have been injured.Witnesses said Sunday’s shooting in southern Gaza occurred at about 6am, when they had been told the site would open. Many had headed towards it early to try to get desperately needed food before the crowds. The military had announced on Friday that the sites would be open from 6am and that the area would be a closed military zone from 6pm until 6am.A GHF spokesperson said there had been “no incident at or in [the] surrounding vicinity” of any distribution site.Adham Dahman, 30, who was at Nasser hospital with a bandage on his chin, told Associated Press that a tank had fired in their direction. “We didn’t know how to escape,” he said. “This is trap for us, not aid.”Zahed Ben Hassan, another witness, said someone next to him had been shot in the head. He said he and others had pulled the body from the scene and managed to flee to the hospital.“They said it was a safe area from 6am until 6pm … so why did they start shooting at us?” he said. “There was light out, and they have their cameras and can clearly see us.”Sanaa Doghmah told Reuters that her husband, Khaled, 36, was fatally shot in the head while trying to reach a distribution site in Rafah to collect food for their five children.Khaled’s aunt, Salwah, said at his funeral: “He was going to get food for his children and himself, to make them live, feed them, because they don’t have a pinch of flour at home.”There have been frequent shootings in the past two weeks near the new hubs, where thousands of Palestinians are being directed to collect food.The GHF announced on Wednesday that its operations would be suspended for 24 hours after Israeli troops opened fire on a crowd of Palestinians, as it pressed Israel to improve civilian safety beyond the perimeter of its distribution sites.Israeli troopskilled at least 27people and injured hundreds on Tuesday far beyond the perimeter of the distribution sites. They denied firing at civilians, but an Israel Defense Forces official admitted soldiers had fired “warning shots toward several suspects who advanced toward the troops” near the food distribution site, without specifying who the suspects were.On 1 June, 31 Palestinians were killed by Israeli fire as they went to receive food. Israel said it had fired warning shots towards several suspects who advanced towards troops.Q&AWhy is it so difficult to report on Gaza?ShowCoverage of the war in Gaza is constrained by Israeli attacks on Palestinian journalists and a bar on international reporters entering the Gaza Strip to report independently on the war.Israel has not allowed foreign reporters to enter Gaza since 7 October 2023, unless they are under Israeli military escort. Reporters who join these trips have no control over where they go, and otherrestrictionsinclude a bar on speaking to Palestinians in Gaza.Palestinian journalists and media workers inside Gaza have paid a heavy price for their work reporting on the war, with over180 killedsince the conflict began.The committee to protect journalists has determined that at least 19 of them “were directly targeted by Israeli forces in killings which CPJ classifies as murders”.Foreign reporters based in Israel filed alegal petitionseeking access to Gaza, but it was rejected by the supreme court on security grounds. Private lobbying by diplomats and public appeals byprominent journalistsandmedia outletshave been ignored by the Israeli government.To ensure accurate reporting from Gaza given these restrictions, the Guardian works with trusted journalists on the ground; our visual​​ teams verif​y photo and videos from third parties; and we use clearly sourced data from organisations that have a track record of providing accurate information in Gaza during past conflicts, or during other conflicts or humanitarian crises.Emma Graham-Harrison, chief Middle East correspondentWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Israelimposed a blockade on all suppliesto Gaza in March, saying Hamas was seizing deliveries for its fighters, which the group denies. A global hunger monitor said in May that half a million people in the strip faced starvation. TheIPC estimatedthat nearly 71,000 children under five were expected to be “acutely malnourished”, with 14,100 cases expected to be severe in the next 11 months.The hubs are set up inside Israeli military zones, to which independent media have no access, and are run by GHF, a new group of mainly US contractors. Israel wants it to replace a system coordinated by the UN and international aid groups.The UN and other humanitarian organisations have rejected the new system, saying the GHF will not be able to meet the needs of Gaza’s 2.3 million people and that it allows Israel to use food as a weapon to control the population.Associated Press and Reuters contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warGazaPalestinian territoriesIsraelMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Armed with pickaxes, shovels and jackhammers, looters disturb the dead. Under the cover of darkness, men exhume graves buried more than 2,000 years ago in Syria’s ancient city of Palmyra, searching for treasure.By day, the destruction caused by grave robbers is apparent. Three-metre-deep holes mar the landscape of Palmyra, where ancient burial crypts lure people with the promise of funerary gold and ancient artefacts that fetch thousands of dollars.“These different layers are important, when people mix them together, it will be impossible for archaeologists to understand what they’re looking at,” said Mohammed al-Fares, a resident of Palmyra and an activist with the NGO Heritage for Peace, as he stood in the remains of an ancient crypt exhumed by looters.He picked up a shattered piece of pottery that tomb raiders had left behind and placed it next to the rusted tailfin of a mortar bomb. Palmyra, which dates back to the third century BC, suffered heavy damage during the period of Islamic State control, when militants blew up parts of the ancient site in 2015, deeming its ruins apostate idols.Palmyra is not the only ancient site under threat. Experts and officials say the looting and trafficking of Syria’s antiquities has surged to unprecedented levels since rebels overthrew the former Syrian president Bashar al-Assad in December, putting the country’s heritage further at risk.According to the Antiquities Trafficking and Heritage Anthropology Research Project (ATHAR), which investigates antiquities black markets online, nearly a third of the 1,500 Syrian cases it has documented since 2012 have occurred since December alone.“When the [Assad] regime fell, we saw a huge spike on the ground. It was a complete breakdown of any constraints that might have existed in the regime periods that controlled looting,” said Amr al-Azm, a professor of Middle East history and anthropology at Shawnee State University in Ohio and co-director of the ATHAR project.The collapse of Syria’s once-feared security apparatus, coupled with widespread poverty, has triggered a gold rush. Located in the heart of the fertile crescent where settled civilisation first emerged, Syria is awash with mosaics, statues and artefacts that fetch top dollar from collectors in the west.In one post on Facebook in December, a user offered a pile of ancient coins for sale. “I have been holding them for 15 years, Free Syria,” the user wrote.Katie Paul, a co-director of the ATHAR project and the director of Tech Transparency Project, said: “The last three to four months has been the biggest flood of antiquities trafficking I have ever seen, from any country, ever.”Paul, along with Azm, tracks the route of trafficked Middle Eastern antiquities online and has created a database of more than 26,000 screenshots, videos and pictures documenting trafficked antiquities dating back to 2012.View image in fullscreenAn intact mosaic offered for sale on a Facebook group.Photograph: Courtesy of the ATHAR project“This is the fastest we’ve ever seen artefacts being sold. Before for example, a mosaic being sold out of Raqqa took a year. Now, mosaics are being sold in two weeks,” said Paul.Syria’s new government has urged looters to stop, offering finder’s fees to those who turn in antiquities rather than sell them, and threatening offenders with up to 15 years in prison. But preoccupied with rebuilding a shattered country and struggling to assert control, Damascus has few resources to protect its archaeological heritage.Much of the looting is being carried out by individuals desperate for cash, hoping to find ancient coins or antiquities they can sell quickly. In Damascus, shops selling metal detectors have proliferated while ads on social media show users discovering hidden treasure with models such as the XTREM Hunter, which retails for just over $2,000 (£1,470).Selling of looted antiquities onlineOthers operate as part of sophisticated criminal networks. A local archaeological watchdog in the city of Salamiya, central Syria, filmed a video while walking through the bronze age-era settlement of Tall Shaykh Ali, where uniform 5-metre-deep holes dug by heavy machinery pockmarked the ground every few steps.“They are doing this day and night. I am scared for my safety, so I don’t approach them,” said a researcher with the watchdog in Salamiya, speaking anonymously for fear of reprisal from criminal looting networks.Other cases show entire mosaics removed intact from sites, the work of experienced professionals.Once out of the ground, antiquities make their way online. Experts say Facebook has emerged as a key hub for the sale of stolen antiquities, with public and private groups offering everything from ancient coins, entire mosaics and heavy stone busts to the highest bidder.The ATHAR project provided the Guardian with dozens of screenshots and videos of Syrian antiquities, including mosaics and Palmyran busts, being sold on Facebook groups. A single Facebook search of “antiquities for sale Syria” in Arabic yielded more than a dozen Facebook groups dedicated to the trading of cultural artefacts, many of them public.In a March video from a Facebook group, a man with a Syrian accent displays a mosaic depicting Zeus on a throne, using his mobile phone for scale. The mosaic is still in the ground in the video, but later surfaces in another photo, removed from the site. “This is just one of the four mosaics we have,” the man brags.In other groups, looters have gone on Facebook Live from archaeological sites, asking users for advice where they should dig next and drumming up excitement from potential buyers who tune in.View image in fullscreenThe sarcophagi in the Tomb of the Three Brothers in Palmyra were beheaded during IS’s rule.Photograph: William Christou/The GuardianIn 2020, Facebook banned the sale of historical antiquities on its platform and said it would remove any related content. However, according to Paul, the policy is rarely enforced despite continued sales on the platform being well documented.“Trafficking of cultural property during conflict is a crime, here you have Facebook acting as a vehicle for the crime. Facebook knows this is an issue,” said Paul. She added that she was tracking dozens of antiquities trading groups on Facebook that have more than 100,000 members, the largest of which has approximately 900,000 members.A representative from Meta, the parent company of Facebook, declined to respond to the Guardian’s request for a comment.The Facebook groups are used as a gateway for traffickers, connecting low-level looters in Syria to criminal networks that smuggle the artefacts out of the country into neighbouring Jordan and Turkey.From there, the pieces are shipped around the world to create fake bills of sale and provenance so they can be laundered into the grey market of antiquities. After 10 to 15 years they make their way into legal auction houses, where collectors and museums, primarily located in the US and Europe, snap them up.With 90% of Syria’s population living in poverty, stopping desperate individuals from looting is a gargantuan task. Instead, experts have said that the responsibility for regulation should fall on the west, which is the primary buyer of the Middle East’s cultural antiquities.“How do we stop this? Stop the demand in the west,” Azm said. “Until the security issue improves, you won’t see an improvement. We focus on the supply side to abrogate the responsibility of the west.”In Palmyra, Fares is still coming to terms with how much his home town has changed since returning in December after years of displacement. Broken stones lie at the feet of the Roman-era Arch of Triumph and the carved faces of sarcophagi in the Tomb of the Three Brothers have been gouged out – all a product of IS iconoclasm.At night, he and other residents stand guard in the ancient city, determined not to let looters steal what remains of a place already plundered by 15 years of war.Explore more on these topicsSyriaArchaeologyMiddle East and north AfricafeaturesShareReuse this content"

She further claims not to have been contacted by the authorities over any of the allegations.She was cleared of any wrongdoing by the adviser on ministerial standards, Laurie Magnus, butresigned as economic secretary to the Treasuryand city minister over the “distraction” being caused for Keir Starmer’s new government.In a letter to Muhammad Yunus, a Nobel prize-winning economist who is the interim leader of the Bangladeshi government, Siddiq has asked for an opportunity to discuss the ongoing controversy during his visit to London next week where he will meet King Charles and see Keir Starmer in Downing Street.In her letter, Siddiq writes that she hopes a meeting might “help clear up the misunderstanding perpetuated by the anti-corruption committee in Dhaka that I have questions to answer in relation to my mother’s sister, the former prime minister of Bangladesh, Sheikh Hasina”.View image in fullscreenSheikh Hasina at the prime minister’s residence in Dhaka, Bangladesh.Photograph: Mohammad Ponir Hossain/ReutersTulip Siddiq decries Bangladesh arrest warrant as ‘politically motivated smear’Read moreShe continued: “I am a UK citizen, born in London and representing the people of Hampstead and Highgate in parliament for the last decade.“I have no property nor any business interests whatsoever in Bangladesh. The country is dear to my heart but it is not the country where I was born, live in or have built my career in.“I have sought to clarify this to the ACC but they refuse to engage with my lawyers in London and apparently keep sending correspondence to a random address in Dhaka.”Siddiq added: “Every move in this fantasy investigation is briefed to the media, and yet no engagement was facilitated with my legal team.“I know you’ll appreciate how important it is to ensure those reports do not become a distraction from the critical work of doing my very best for my constituents and my country.”The ACC has been probing allegations that Sheikh Hasina and her wider family embezzled billions of pounds from infrastructure spending based on a series of claims made by Bobby Hajjaj, a political opponent of the former prime minister.Siddiq has claimed she is being targeted by a “politically motivated smear campaign” orchestrated by her aunt’s opponents.Last month it was reported that awarrant had been issued in Bangladeshfor Siddiq’s arrest.She claims to have no knowledge of any such warrant or court hearings to which she was required to appear. As a 2B extradition country, the UK requires ministers and judges to see clear evidence from Bangladesh before they make an arrest decision.After Siddiq had referred herself to the adviser on ministerial standards last year amid allegations about her acquirement of property in the UK, she was cleared in January of any wrongdoing.Magnus had found no evidence to suggest that any of Siddiq’s assets were derived from anything other than legitimate means but added that she could have been more alive to the reputational risks arising from her family’s ties to Bangladesh.The inquiry had also looked into her presence at the signing of a 2013 nuclear deal between her aunt and Vladimir Putin in Moscow over which there had been claims aired in the media of embezzlement by Siddiq. The standards adviser accepted her explanation that she had been in Moscow socially and as a tourist.Last month the National Crime Agency froze almost £90m of luxury London property belonging to two menlinked toSiddiq’s aunt.Shafiqul Alam, the Bangladeshi leader’s spokesperson, said his government had not yet received Siddiq’s letter although it is understood to have been emailed and posted by the former’s minister’s lawyers. “We cannot comment on something we have not seen,” he said.Explore more on these topicsBangladeshLabourSheikh HasinaSouth and central AsianewsShareReuse this content"

After tweaking her fiscal rules last autumn, she has an additional £113bn funded by borrowing for capital spending.Her plans will include £86bn for science and technology across four years and an extra £4.5bn for schools – taking funding per pupil to its highest level ever.However, day-to-day spending is more constrained in some areas, while theNHSand defence swallow up higher allocations.As well as policing, the Home Office budget covers Border Force and spending on asylum costs, while the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government has been battling for funds for the affordable homes programme, councils, homelessness and regional growth.Labour has manifesto pledges to build 1.5m homes and deliver 13,000 new police officers.Pressed on the policing budget, the technology secretary, Peter Kyle, said Home Office and others would have to “do their bit”.Funding for the police has the potential to become a politically difficult issue for Keir Starmer. Tory former shadow cabinet minister Robert Jenrick has been campaigning against transport fare dodging and Nigel Farage’s Reform UK party is also highlighting the issue.Asked about which public services will be prioritised, Kyle said “every part of our society is struggling” and numerous sectors had asked Reeves for more money.“On the fact that the police have been writing to the chancellor, they have,” he told the BBC’s Sunday With Laura Kuenssberg programme. “We also have letters from the universities, we have letters from doctors about the health service, we have letters from campaigners for child poverty writing to us, and other aspects of challenges in Britain at the moment.“Every part of our society is struggling because of the inheritance that we had as a country and as a government.”He pointed to the £1.1bn extra funding already earmarked for police this year, as he defended Reeves’s handling of the spending review process.“We expect the police to start embracing the change they need to do, to do their bit for change as well. We are doing our bit,” Kyle said.“You see a chancellor that is striving to get investment to the key parts of our country that needs it the most … You will see the priorities of this government reflected in the spending review, which sets the departmental spending into the long term.“But this is a partnership. Yes, the Treasury needs to find more money for those key priorities, but the people delivering them need to do their bit as well.”While some areas of spending may be cut or receive only low increases, the NHS is set to receive an uplift of up to £30bn by 2028, while defence spending is expected to rise to 2.5% of GDP by 2027.Kyle defended the chancellor’s approach to public spending, saying she was like Apple co-founder Steve Jobs who turned the company around when it was 90 days from insolvency.He told Sky News’ Trevor Phillips: “Now Steve Jobs turned it around by inventing the iMac, moving to a series of products like the iPod.“Now we’re starting to invest in the vaccine processes of the future. Some of the hi-tech solutions that are going to be high growth. We’re investing in our space sector. All these really high, highly innovative sectors.“We are investing into those key innovations of the future. We know that we cannot break this vicious cycle of high tax and low growth by doing the same as we always have done. We have to innovate our way out of this and we are doing so by investing in those high-growth sectors.”As part of the government’s drive to innovate, Starmer will on Monday unveil a plan to train a million schoolchildren and seven million workers in artificial intelligence (AI) at a cost of £187m.Speaking at UK Tech Week, Starmer will say the government is“putting the power of AI into the hands of the next generation – so they can shape the future, not be shaped by it”.“This training programme will unlock opportunity in every classroom – and lays the foundations for a new era of growth,” he will say. “Too many children from working families like the one I grew up in are written off. I am determined to end that.”The Tories accused Labour of copying their own plans in office over the commitment to £86bn of science spending, and also said they would cut welfare spending to save money for extra policing.Liberal Democrat leader Ed Davey called on the chancellor to rule out any cuts to social care funding at this week’s spending review, warning they would be “devastating” for those in need of care.Explore more on these topicsEconomic policyRachel ReevesNHSLabournewsShareReuse this content"

He was sentenced to an indefinite hospital order after pleading guilty to manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility as a result of paranoid schizophrenia and three counts of attempted murder.It was announced in February that prosecutors, police and medical professionalswould be scrutinised in the two-year inquiry, including the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC).Grace’s father, Dr Sanjoy Kumar, said that an IOPC regional director had behaved inappropriately when the bereaved families met the watchdog in March 2024, including by starting the meeting with a prayer.“I found it patronising and offensive,” Kumar told the Sunday Times. “I didn’t want a prayer, I wanted answers. I’ve lost my daughter and it was his job to give me the truth, not a prayer.“There are plenty of places to pray and the IOPC isn’t one of them.”The regional director at the meeting, Derrick Campbell, is now the watchdog’s director of engagement, the newspaper reported.An IOPC spokesperson said: “We can confirm we’ve received a complaint about one of our directors and we are dealing with it in line with our complaints and feedback procedure.”The watchdog previously prepared a report that concluded Leicestershire police officers had failed to properly investigate an assault on warehouse workers by Calocane which could have stopped his killing spree a month later. Three officers were due to face a misconduct meeting but the force postponed this.In March, the IOPC said it would reinvestigate whetherCalocane’s previous history and an outstanding arrest warrantwere seen by officers before the investigation was closed down.The watchdog said it had made its decision “after the force provided new evidence, which had not previously been available to the IOPC” and “representations by the bereaved families which led to further inquiries with Leicestershire police”.Explore more on these topicsNottinghamIndependent Office for Police ConductnewsShareReuse this content"

But with the UKaid budget cut back from 0.5% of gross national income to 0.3%and the focus shifting towards bilateral aid the expectation is that there will be a major reduction at Wednesday’s spending review.Pollard, who leads the Oxford Vaccine Group, said that as well as continuing to save lives in poorer countries, there was a self-interested case for continuing with similar levels of support.“It’s a safer place, obviously, for people who are in situations where they wouldn’t have been able to access these vaccines without the government support, but it also makes it a safe place for us, because it’s acting as part of the shield that we have against the spread of infectious diseases around the world,” he said.A number of the vaccines used by Gavi originated in the UK, Pollard said, such as a new vaccine for malaria co-developed by Oxford University, and this meant the expertise and infrastructure were in place when Covid descended.“The Covid vaccine was developed on the back of years of funding, both from the UK funding sources of government, Wellcome Trust and so on, as well as international funders that put teams of people working on vaccines here in Oxford so we could then respond when a pandemic happened,” he said.“If we weren’t doing this type of work, having the infrastructure and capabilities in the UK, we wouldn’t have been in a position to have such an impact so early in the pandemic against that virus.”Dr Sandy Douglas, senior vaccinologist at Oxford University’s Jenner Institute, who led efforts to scale up production of the Covid vaccine, said Gavi was known as one of the most cost-efficient of all aid projects, with one estimate suggesting a child’s life was saved for every £1,200 spent on it.“There really aren’t very many ways of spending money anywhere in the world that can save a child’s life for so little money, and do it scalably so hundreds of thousands of lives, millions of lives, are saved over time,” he said.“The withdrawal or reduction of British funding to Gavi is going to result in the avoidable deaths of many children. Labour played a leading role in establishing Gavi, and Gordon Brown designed the financing mechanism that helps it to operate. I think it’s something Labour should be proud of, among its greatest achievements since the NHS, probably.”Moazzam Malik, chief executive of Save the Children UK, who was previously director general for Africa at the FCDO, said the UK had traditionally been “a very active player” in multilateral aid efforts such as Gavi and the Global Fund, which focuses on HIV/Aids, tuberculosis and malaria.Pulling back from this would be noted internationally, he said: “People kind of appreciate that leadership. And if the UK decides to take a much more limited position, what the world would see from that is a sense of the UK pulling back.”Gavi’s statistics show that it has vaccinated more than 1.1 billion children in 78 countries in its 25 years of operation, preventing nearly 19 million deathsAnFCDO spokesperson said Jenny Chapman, the international development minister and peer, had set out that “global health is a priority for this government and is a key issue as we modernise our approach to international development.“Whilst we would not comment on the size of future pledges before announcing them, we continue to work with our partners, including Gavi, on this crucial issue.”Explore more on these topicsVaccines and immunisationHealthForeign, Commonwealth and Development OfficenewsShareReuse this content"

It follows pressure from conservationists and the release of a David Attenborough film featuring rare underwater footage of the devastation to the seabed caused by bottom trawling in British waters.The practice involve vessels dragging weighted nets over vulnerable habitats, forcing fish, shellfish and unwanted bycatch into a vast trawl net.The government’s proposals would ban the practice in 41 marine protected areas (MPAs), focusing on ecologically sensitive and vulnerable seabed habitats, covering 30,000 sq km of England’s seas. Together with existing bans, the proposal would bring the total area in which bottom trawling is banned to 48,000 sq km.Reed, who will represent the UK at the UN Ocean Conference (UNOC), said the government was taking “decisive action” to protect England’s seas. “Bottom trawling is damaging our precious marine wildlife and habitats,” he said. “Without such action, our oceans would be irreversibly destroyed.”Joan Edwards, the director of policy at theWildlifeTrusts, which has long campaigned for better management of MPAs, said: “Removing this pressure is a great step forward towards protecting not only the wildlife and fish stocks within those sites but also the carbon stored in the seabed muds beneath.”She said she hoped after the government’s consultation on the proposals that the measures would apply rapidly in a “win-win” for nature and the climate.Hugo Tagholm, the executive director of Oceana UK, said that if the bans were fully implemented it would provide “an invaluable and urgently needed lifeline for England’s seas”.Oceana found that fishing vessels with bottom-towed gear were active in the UK’s offshore MPAs for 33,000 hours in 2023, adding up to four years.Jonny Hughes, the senior policy manager at the Blue Marine Foundation, an ocean conservation charity, said: “Conservation policy is awash with shiny new announcements and impressive sounding targets whereas what is needed is actual delivery. This, at first glance seems to be about delivering conservation. We need to see the full details, but initial reading is positive.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

The co-chairs of the BMA’s resident doctors committee (RDC) have urged their estimated 55,000 members to vote for the action.The six experts say there was a genuine case for resident doctors to receive a big salary increase after years of erosion in the value of their pay, but that it had largely been addressed by the 22% they received last year for 2023/24 and 2024/25 and the average 5.4% they were given last month for 2025/26.They also say the RDC leaders’ call for resident doctors to back a fresh six-month campaign of walkouts is mistaken. “A strike now would harm patients and diminish the cause of these doctors. The calls for strike misjudge the mood in the country. There is no spare money. This is a futile gesture guiding people into a maze without a thread”, they write in their letter.“In our view the NHS is at a more perilous state than at any time in our careers. A doctors strike would further diminish the ability of the NHS to deliver, and play into the hands of those who don’t believe in an NHS – publicly funded [and] based on need not want.“We urge resident doctors to keep to the spirit of the Hippocratic oath – vote for the NHS and vote No to strike action.”The other signatories are David Colin-Thome, the Department of Health’s national clinical director for primary care under Tony Blair and Gordon Brown; Dr James Kingsland, a GP and former ministerial adviser; and Dr Fiona Cornish, a senior GP in Cambridge and former member of the BMA’s GP committee.The health secretary, Wes Streeting, appointed Oldham, who worked for the previous Labour and coalition governments, as a senior adviser in March on his plans to create more “neighbourhood health” services as part of the government’s forthcoming 10-year plan for the NHS.Responding to the letter, Streeting urged resident doctors to reject industrial action in their ballot, which ends on 7 July.“Strikes should only ever be a last resort. Resident doctors have had a 28.9% pay rise [since 2022/23], and they have a government working with them to improve their career progression and conditions.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Instead of cutting the NHS recovery off at its knees, work with us to turn the health service around”, he said.However, RDC co-chairs Dr Melissa Ryan and Dr Ross Nieuwoudt, said this year’s 5.4% pay award – the biggest in the public sector – was too little to help them restore the lost value of their earnings since 2008.“Resident doctors are currently paid 23% less than they were in 2008. Even after this year’s pay award it would still need a rise of 26% to bring pay back to that level.“We don’t believe any of the doctors in this letter are worth 23% less than they were in 2008, and neither presumably do they. The question, then, is how we restore the value of this profession, how quickly, and how we work with government to get there.“At the rate Wes Streeting is suggesting it would take more than a decade to restore our pay. The NHS does not have that time,” they said.Explore more on these topicsNHSDoctorsTrade unionsIndustrial actionHealth policyHealthPublic services policynewsShareReuse this content"

Footage captured on Sunday afternoon showed protesters holding signs on the freeway facing off against law enforcement in tactical gear as the sound of firing munitions echoed through the area.The president’s decision to deploy national guard troops into Los Angeles, against the wishes of state and local officials, has sent shockwaves through American politics. California’s governor,Gavin Newsom, and other Democratic governors across the US have sharply criticized the move, describing it as an “alarming abuse of power”. Newsom has called on the administration to rescind the “unlawful” deployment.“This is a serious breach of state sovereignty – inflaming tensions while pulling resources from where they’re actually needed. Rescind the order. Return control toCalifornia,” Newsom said.Donald Trumpordered the deployment of the national guard late on Saturday night following days of clashes between demonstrators and US immigration authorities. The decision marked a stunning escalation in a broad crackdown on immigrants in the United States following raids across the country which have triggered protests.How can Trump use the national guard on US soil?Read moreTrump’s federalization of the guard troopsis the first timean American president has used such power since the 1992 LA riots. At that time widespread violence broke out in reaction to the acquittal of four white police officers for brutally beating Black motorist Rodney King.The situation quickly escalated on Sunday following the deployment of some 300 national guard troops. By the afternoon, the Los Angeles police department had declared the protestan “unlawful assembly”, ordering everyone in the area to leave or face arrest. The department reported that arrests were under way and that it had authorized the use of “less-lethal munitions”.View image in fullscreenThe national guard, police and protesters stand off outside of a downtown jail in Los Angeles on Sunday.Photograph: Spencer Platt/Getty ImagesPopping sounds could be heard through the area as protesters chanted “go home” and shame. Journalists and protesters were reportedly struck. TheLos Angelespolice said that two officers were injured after being struck by motorcyclists attempting to “breach a skirmish line”.Newsom had urged protesters to “stay peaceful”.“Don’t giveDonald Trumpwhat he wants,” Newsom said.Trump’s move has been followed by the threat of even more escalation. Earlier, Pete Hegseth, Trump’s controversial and hardline defense secretary, had raised the possibility of deploying US marines onto the streets of the Democrat-run state following the protests that erupted in the wake of raids from Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) authorities in the state.“Under President Trump, violence & destruction against federal agents & federal facilities will NOT be tolerated. It’s COMMON SENSE,” Hegseth wrote on social media.“If violence continues, active duty Marines at Camp Pendleton will also be mobilized – they are on high alert,” Hegseth said.Camp Pendleton is a large military base south of Los Angeles and north of San Diego.Newsom called the potential deployment of US marines “deranged” .Trump uses LA protests to redirect dissent from policy failures to the ‘enemy within’Read more“The secretary of defense is now threatening to deploy active-duty marines on American soil against its own citizens. This is deranged behavior,” Newsomwroteon X.Kristi Noem, the Department of Homeland Security secretary, criticized Newsom’s stance on ABC’s Face the Nation. She said: “If he was doing his job people wouldn’t have gotten hurt the last couple of days … Governor Newsom has proven that he makes bad decisions. The president knows that he makes bad decisions and that’s why the president chose the safety of this community over waiting for Governor Newsom to get some sanity.”The independent Vermont senator Bernie Sanders called the situation a threat to US democracy. “We have a president who is moving this country rapidly into authoritarianism,” he told CNN. “He does not believe in the rule of law.”Tensions in Los Angles had begun on Friday, when protesters clashed with law enforcement officials conducting immigration raids on multiple locations in the sprawling city’s downtown.On Saturday,US immigrationauthorities extended enforcement action into Paramount, a majority Latino area south-east of Los Angeles, and were met with more protests outside an industrial park.A standoff developed between border patrol personnel in riot gear and gas masks and protesters. As demonstrations continued, law enforcement deployed teargas and protesters also threw objects at them. At least one car was set alight.Trump then promised to send in the national guard – a move that many critics have feared might happen during his second administration amid fears that the US is sliding into authoritarianism.“The federal government is taking over theCalifornianational guard and deploying 2,000 soldiers in Los Angeles – not because there is a shortage of law enforcement, but because they want a spectacle,” Newsom said later. “Don’t give them one.”View image in fullscreenProtesters block the 101 freeway near the metropolitan detention center of downtown Los Angeles on Sunday.Photograph: Eric Thayer/APOn his own social media platform, Truth Social, Trump praised the national guard, even before it was reported that troops had arrived. “Great job by the National Guard in Los Angeles after two days of violence, clashes and unrest,” he said in a post filled with insults at Los Angeles mayor Karen Bass and Newsom.“These Radical Left protests, by instigators and often paid troublemakers, will NOT BE TOLERATED. Also, from now on, MASKS WILL NOT BE ALLOWED to be worn at protests. What do these people have to hide, and why???” he added.Ice officers and police have been wearing face masks during raids and arrests but Noem defended this on Sunday, saying: “It’s for the safety of those individuals.” She did not specify how law enforcement will prevent protesters from wearing masks.Nanette Barragán, who has Paramount in her constituency, said she has been told to prepare for a large presence ofIceagents inCalifornia.“We’ve been told to get ready for 30 days of enforcement. Thirty days of ICE enforcement,” Barragán told CNN, adding that their presence is “going to escalate the situation.”“We haven’t asked for the help. We don’t need the help. This is [President Trump] escalating it, causing tensions to rise. It’s only going to make things worse in a situation where people are already angry over immigration enforcement,” Barragán said.Sanders warns of authoritarianism after Trump deploys national guard to LARead moreTom Homan, Trump’s “border czar”, or the White House executive associate director of enforcement and removal operations, warned that immigration enforcement will continue “every day” in Los Angeles.“I’m telling you what, we’re going to keep enforcing law every day in LA,” Homan toldNBC News. “Every day in LA, we’re going to enforce immigration law. I don’t care if they like it or not.”Homan was asked if his prior warnings to elected state and local officials to not obstruct federal immigration enforcement included Newsom and Bass. Homan said he did not believe Bass had “crossed the line yet”.But, he added, “I’ll say it about anybody. You cross that line, it’s a felony to knowingly harbor and conceal an illegal alien. It’s a felony to impede law enforcement doing their job.”Trump has long promised mass immigration raids across the US after campaigning in part last year on anti-immigrant sentiment. Since he returned to office Ice raids have increased, in particular targeting some areas traditionally left alone such as court houses where immigrants might be attending hearings.Explore more on these topicsLos AngelesCaliforniaWest CoastUS politicsGavin NewsomUS immigrationProtestnewsShareReuse this content"

Operators have spent years lobbying against a federal crackdown.Nationwide exclusion lists, blocking gamblers who encounter problems like addiction from placing a bet anywhere in the country, are also “ripe for a federal conversation”, Maynard said in an interview with the Guardian.Like most gambling policies, such lists are currently state-focused, and often easily circumventable by crossing state lines.Maynard joined Massachusetts’s gambling commission in August 2022, the same month sports betting waslegalizedin the state, and became the regulator’s interim chair last spring. A permanent appointment followed in the fall.His relationship with operators has, at times, been strained.“When I think about the industry right now, I see a highway without speed limits, cars without seatbelt dingers,” he said. “Regulators are who put the seatbelt dingers in. I don’t think the car manufacturers just woke up one day and decided to annoy whoever’s driving the car until they put their seatbelt on.“And so I think that’s the perfect place for a regulator to be: to come in and say, you know, we’re not going to prevent every crash that could happen, right? But what we’re going to do is make sure that people are educated in what they’re doing; that they’re trained up to a certain standard before they ever do it; make sure that those who seek to benefit economically from this industry are held to high standards.”Online sports betting has surged since 2018, when the US supreme court struck down a decades-old law that prohibited the practice across much of the country. “And we’re really early on in this process,” said Maynard.The industry has moved fast – sports betting is now legal in 37 states – andpushed back hardagainst many proposed regulations. While lobbyists for legal operators insist they are heavily regulated, they have bluntly dismissed calls for federal action, andresisted restrictionsput forward by states.Legal online gambling operators have spent years pushing to attract millions of users to their platforms, and generate more money from those users, as the nascent market continues its rapid expansion.“I do want to construct a partnership,” Maynard said, of his work with the industry. “But there is a [need to be] regulated, and there is a regulator.”Gambling regulators typically have two primary goals: to protect the legal betting market, which generates welcome tax dollars for their state; and shield the state’s citizens from harm, amid mounting concerns over the social impact of gambling’s rise.“A lot of people try to figure me out as a regulator. It’s really, really simple,” said Maynard. “I’m not thinking about big business … I’m thinking about: how does this affect the patrons and the citizens of Massachusetts?”Operators have not always welcomed his scrutiny. A year ago, two months into Maynard’s interim stint as chair, the commission hosted a public roundtable on how, when and why betting platform operators placed limits on gamblers, amid claims that some who routinely won had faced restrictions.At the last minute, the industry swerved en masse. Ten gambling firms operating in Massachusetts, after initially signaling they would attend, turned down the invitation and requested a private meeting instead. “Transparency is key to integrity,” Maynard said, as he opened the roundtable. When another was held last fall, the industry showed up.“They were worried about having the conversation in public,” reflected Maynard. “My job is not to increase profits for the operators. That’s not my job. My job is to balance the equities and to cure any inequities. And so I didn’t take it personally.”Artificial intelligence is, meanwhile, transforming the gambling sector. “If operators are using technology to target bettors, that technology can be used to promote healthy behaviors,” said Maynard. “And I believe that a way that happens quicker is for regulators to get involved on the issue.”But when regulations and restrictions are proposed on sports betting, fromcurbing bets on specific student athletestobans on in-game betting, the industry’s legal operators and their representatives often warn such measures will create friction for gamblers – and risk driving them to illegal, unregulated platforms.Maynard has grown tired of this refrain. “I don’t like the unregulated market being used as the boogeyman to every operator for every reason,” he said. “I don’t want the legal market to race to be the illegal market. I want the illegal market to either not exist, or if it does exist, it’s in a highly competitive space with what’s regulated.”“Some reasonable, rational friction is a good thing,” he added, citing the introduction of weapons detectors in casinos across Massachusetts.“We did have to work on that. I mean, listen, it created friction. And we were told by the operators that it would create friction. I think a vast majority of patrons in Massachusetts would say that friction is well worth it to ensure that no guns hit the floor of the casino.”On college campuses andeven in high school classroomsnationwide, concern has risen over the prevalence of underage gambling. “This is a good opportunity for the operators,” observed Maynard, who has welcomed some adverts funded by industry.No one under the age of 21 in Massachusetts is supposed to wager on sports betting. “I don’t bury my head in the sand. I know that it’s happening,” said Maynard. “The question becomes: what can I do to ensure that it’s not happening? And we are doing the best we can.”“No kid wants to hear me lecture them on why they shouldn’t be doing this,” he said. “But you know, when the operators get involved … when athletes get involved, when the leagues get involved, I believe – and we’re testing this, but I believe – that’s where we can see some changes.”Officials across the US have struggled to gauge the scope and scale of offshore, illegal sports betting. Some studies haveindicatedthe black market is vast, despite the legal market’s boom in recent years.“We’re going to have to play Whac-a-Mole a little bit,” said Maynard, “to combat the illegal market, while promoting the fact that the legal market has protection and oversights by the state that the illegal market doesn’t have.”On this, and so many other issues, however, gambling regulators face an uphill battle. At times, Maynard sounded despondent. “There are days I don’t know if anyone cares about what we’re doing,” he said, during one interview.Regulators across the board “are not being respected” right now, he suggested, saying: “I think that trickles across and down. It can be as wide as the industry, and down to the average citizen.”Ultimately, he believes the time has come to find gambling’s speed limits and seat belts. “When I lay down, I sleep really well,” he said.Explore more on these topicsUS newsThe big betGamblingUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

It also puts all the other steps in the industry and the value chain in danger.”She said Europe must step in to save the sector because it was fundamental for military security and was a large employer, and if it failed, the continent would be left reliant on the US and China for a key manufacturing material.There is also the growing problem of cheap Chinese steel imports, something the European Commission has in its sights in talks with Beijing over its dumping of goods in the EU, which are also covering the oversupply of cars andfast fashion. Chinese steel imports soared by 36% in the first quarter of 2025, according to Eurostat.According to Henne, Russian steel is still appearing on the market, at a rate of 3m-4m tonnes a year, just short of the 3.8m tonnes the EU as a whole exports to the US.The US doubling of the tariff on steel and aluminium importsdoes not apply to the UK, which will continue to pay 25% until 9 July and is racing to implement the terms of a bilateral dealstruck last monththat would take the rate down to zero.Ministers are working to ensure the UK’s biggest player in the sector, Tata Steel,is not excluded from the dealbecause it has begun importing semi-finished products from India and Europe since closing its blast furnace in south Wales last year. This could breach US rules that require all steel to be “melted and poured” in the country from which it is imported.US representatives also have concerns that British Steel, which is owned by China’s Jingye group, could be used as a “back door” to bring in Chinese products. The UK government used emergency legislation totake control of the company’s plant in Scunthorpe, and according to the Sunday Times, ministers now face a standoff with Jingye over a £1bn-plus compensation claim to get it to relinquish its interest.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

So the cost of manufacturing has gone up,” she said.The impact “is a lesson that the US has to learn, unfortunately, I believe, the hard way,” she said. “What they are doing is actually limiting their own growth potential.”In its second-quarter outlook report issued last Thursday, Eurofer, the EU steel trade association, said the US tariffs had dealt “a severe blow” to recovery expectations. It has called on the EU to bring in emergency measures to help save the industry.“There is a lot that we can do to save the steel industry,” said Henne, calling on the European Commission to do more to ensure hydrogen comes on stream at a competitive price to reduce the reliance on oil- and gas-fuelled furnaces.“Reducing the tariffs would be a good thing, but equally important for us is competitive energy pricing,” she said.Explore more on these topicsSteel industryEuropeEnergy industryTrump tariffsTariffsnewsShareReuse this content"

Having established herself as the No 1 player in the world and made such significant improvements to her game and mentality, she playedsome of the best tennisof her career in Paris en route to the final. Sabalenka felt she was ready to tackle all obstacles. With her crushing defeat against Coco Gauff in the French Open final after three difficult sets, she found out she was not.Her expression of that disappointment, however, was one of her least impressive performances of the year. During the trophy ceremony, with Gauff sitting metres away, Sabalenka’s insistence on repeatedly lamenting her “terrible match” was awkward enough. But in her press conference, after having a short amount of time to cool off, Sabalenka tripled down.Coco Gauff claims first French Open title after fightback floors Aryna SabalenkaRead moreGauff had won not because of her incredible level, she said, but because of her own mistakes off easy balls. How had her opponent made life difficult for her? By her framed shots magically landing in the court. Had Iga Swiatek reached the final, she concluded, the Pole would have won.Nothing Sabalenka said was rooted in reality. Over the years, Gauff has built herself into one of the toughest players on the tour. She is the best defensive player in the world, which she pairs with her improvisational skills, intelligence and discipline. Between her phenomenal two-handed backhand, her potent first serve and an improving forehand that is perfectly suited to clay courts with its heavy topspin, Gauff also has more than enough weapons to hold her own against the best in the world. The American makes it incredibly difficult for any opponent to play their best tennis against her, which is why Sabalenka has repeatedly struggled to do so.Under pressure from the 27-year-old in tough, windy conditions that could have easily exposed her own insecurities behind her serve and forehand, this was an immense fighting performance from Gauff, and an impressive victory. She is the first woman in history to win herfirst two grand slam titlesfrom a set down, with both victories coming against Sabalenka. Gauff is now a multiple grand slam title winner at 21 and ranked No 2 behind the Belarusian. This is no fluke.View image in fullscreenAryna Sabalenka was disconsolate after losing against Coco Gauff from a set up.Photograph: Tnani Badreddine/DPPI/ShutterstockAfter her victory, Gauff reflected on her difficulties before her first grand slam final at Roland Garros in 2022. Before that match, aged 18, she had been consumed by doubts and anxiety, unable to even breathe and questioning whether she would ever be able to handle the occasion. She learned from those lessons and has evolved into a formidable competitor who performs reliably well in the biggest moments. She now has 10 wins and three defeats in finals, a supreme record. Even after losing two WTA 1000 finals in Madrid , Gauff managed to save her best performance for the biggest final of all. Great champions thrive under pressure.By contrast, Sabalenka is still trying to exorcise old demons. As a three-time grand slam title winner and one of the most successful players of her generation, she has handled herself extremely well in some matches, but under the right circumstances against the wrong opponent she still struggles to contain her emotions. Instead of dismissing the challenge posed by an opponent who has outplayed her in the two biggest matches they have contested, she could learn from the example set by one of her closest rivals.On the path to this title, inspiration sprung up for Gauff in unexpected places. The night before the final, she was absent-mindedly scrolling on TikTok when a video of the Olympic 200m champion Gabby Thomas appeared. Thomas was explaining to a reporter how she had used written manifestations to aid in her quest for gold.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He scored the goal that put Portugal level in this final but had been withdrawn, exhausted, late in normal time and now, as the men left on the field lined up on the halfway line, he stood on the touchline where he could not watch but could hear the roar as Rúben Neves scored the penalty that took Portugal to the title, and then he slipped to his knees and the tears came. It had taken a shootout but they have their secondNations League, defeating Spain in Munich.Goals from Martín Zubimendi, Nuno Mendes and then Mikel Oyarzabal had given Spain a 2-1 lead before Ronaldo made it 2-2 on the hour. Now, an hour after that, it all came down to two shots: Álvaro Morata missed Spain’s fourth spot kick and Neves scored Portugal’s fifth to win 5-3 on penalties, allowing Ronaldo to collect the 34th trophy of his career, aged 40. There was a smile, a joke about its weight and then he carried it to his teammates and lifted it into the sky.Portugal beat Spain on penalties to win Nations League final – as it happenedRead moreIt had been a long night, and if this was a battle of the generations between him and Lamine Yamal, as it had been billed, the elder man won it. In truth, though, while the focus was on the Portugal captain and the Spanish teenager, 23 years his junior, cameras following them even when both had been withdrawn and were sitting on the bench, this was about many more players. About Oyarzabal and Zubimendi, Mendes, Rafael Leão and, in the end, Diogo Costa, who dived to his right to save from Morata. Neves then smashed hard and low, turning to see red shirts running towards him.When it all ended, Luis de la Fuente gathered his players.Nations League winners two years ago, European champions last summer, they had been unable to make it three trophies in a row but he was proud. Spain had started well too: in fact, both times Portugal had drawn level, it had been hard to grasp, although it was also true that Spain faded badly and that Roberto Martínez’s side had been closer to avoiding the shootout.It hadn’t been long before Lamine Yamal had been taken down by the kind of tackle that said something about his threat, although with the teenager drawing them in on the right the real danger was on the left. There, a superb long diagonal from Dean Huijsen allowed Nico Williams to control brilliantly, dash into the area and pull back for Pedri to sidefoot just wide. From there too, Williams cut inside and whipped fractionally past the far post.View image in fullscreenDiogo Costa saves Álvaro Morata’s penalty.Photograph: Christian Charisius/APAnd yet it was through the middle thatSpainscored the first when Oyarzabal’s lovely touch sent Zubimendi running through. He found Lamine whose chipped return wasn’t dealt with by Rúben Dias, Neves or Costa and Zubimendi put in the loose ball from close range. Portugal responded fast, Mendes stepping past opponents to hit a hard, clean low shot into the corner. But Spain reasserted themselves and Oyarzabal gave them the lead again on 45, Pedri slipping the pass through for him to turn into the net.This was the 16th goal Oyarzabal has scored for Spain, his third in a final. His fourth if you include the 2020 Olympics. His was the winner against England last summer but he has lost the other three: the 2021 Nations League final to France, to Brazil at Tokyo 2020, and now here.

The 26-year-old Real Madrid forward teed up the substitute Michael Olise late on to secure victory for the visitors.Mike Maignan was just as important for France, who lost a nine-goal semi-final thriller to Spain on Thursday, in this third-place playoff as the goalkeeper made important saves throughout.PA SportWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.It can seem that Ronaldo is not there at times, but he always is. When Mendes escaped Lamine Yamal and his cross took a deflection, looping up and dropping behind Marc Cucurella, there he was again to volley in from close range. It was his 134th international goal and off he went, pointing at his chest. Spain could hardly believe it. They were not dominating as they had before, not creating either, yet nor had they felt under threat. Now though, with Fabián Ruiz and Pedri departed, the control slipped away, even if Williams did then send a shot whistling wide.Martínez’s side, meanwhile, were stepping up. The introduction of Leão changed the game. Unai Simón had to save Bruno Fernandes’s free-kick right on 90 minutes and extra time brought a different flow, a different Portugal. They should have had the lead immediately when Mendes, the greatest threat with Leão, set up Nélson Semedo for a startling miss from five yards. And with 20 seconds remaining Diogo Jota headed over, their moment instead waiting for them on the penalty spot.Explore more on these topicsNations LeaguePortugalSpainmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

The manager did not hold back after the lacklustre performance inthe 1-0 qualifying win against Andorra in Barcelonaon Saturday, questioning their attitude and body language.The result followed winsagainst AlbaniaandLatviaat Wembley in March during Tuchel’s first camp and means England have maximum points in Group K. They have also kept three clean sheets.England were dismal against minnows Andorra but it really doesn’t matter | Jonathan WilsonRead moreTuchel, however, was not shy about highlighting what he did not like against Andorra, which included how the players came to do their own things after they could not blow the tie open, a freestyle approach that led to an overall aimlessness.The travellingEnglandfans also booed the team off at half-time and full time and they will want to see a significant improvement in the friendly against Senegal in Nottingham on Tuesday night.Tuchel said: “What risk [in calling the players out]? What should I say? That we played a good match and are happy. The risk is only that you exaggerate it and make something of it that was not there. Everything I said I said already to the team. There is no harm done. We were not happy and no single player will be happy with what we showed. Why would the coach be? And why would we be shy of saying so? If we want to get better, we first need to address that we were not happy with the end of both halves.“I didn’t name a single name. We do this as a team. It’s always a ‘we’ and I didn’t like how we ended the match and the way we ended the first half. I didn’t like the attitude or the energy level and how that dropped. I liked the beginning [of the game]. It always includes me.“This is a top group. I love the players. I love their character. They know that they underperformed. There is not a big thing in it. We know we underperformed and we are open about it and they are eager to do it better. We will now show them exactly what we want from them and how to it better in the video session tomorrow and the day after.”Tuchel was asked what he had done wrong. “I don’t know … we still won a World Cup qualifier. I am the first one to ask if we could do better. I felt us well prepared and I felt us good in the first 25 minutes.

I thought it was a very strong lineup.”Tuchel was frustrated at the lack of dynamic running off the ball; how his players repeatedly settled for passes into feet. As for the body language, he has made great play of the need for positive interactions between teammates, good communication and even things like high fives. That did not happen. Tuchel made the point that Kane was “one of the very few who stepped up and put a shift in at the end when things got a bit stuck and uncomfortable”.The German is not about to worry, even if there is the prospect of his honeymoon period in the job coming to an end. “I always feel pressure as I am not happy with myself,” he said. “The biggest pressure comes from myself. We have three wins and three clean sheets and we have a friendly match on Tuesday. I have felt more pressure than that. Are England managers judged differently? Fair enough.

The Jamaica-born official grew up in Sheffield and oversaw more than 300 top-flight matches, starting with his breakthrough appointment as Derby hosted Wimbledon in August 1997. The game was, however, abandoned due to floodlight failure.The Sheffield and Hallamshire County Football Association posted on X: “We are deeply saddened to learn of the passing of our former chair and trailblazing referee, Uriah Rennie. Uriah made history as the Premier League’s first black referee, officiating over 300 top-flight matches between 1997 and 2008. He broke down barriers, shaped our football community and inspired generations to come. Our thoughts are with Uriah’s family and friends at this difficult time.”Rennie became a Fifa-listed referee in 2000 and joined the select group of professionals one year later. He told BBC News in April how, while on holiday in Turkey last year, he felt severe pain in his back and doctors discovered he had an inoperable neurological condition that left him wheelchair-bound.“I spent a month laid on my back and another four months sitting in bed,” he said. “They kept me in hospital until February, they found a nodule pushing on my spine and it was a rare neurological condition so it’s not something they can operate on.”The former Liverpool and Nottingham Forest striker Stan Collymore posted on X: “Incredibly sad to hear of the passing of referee Uriah Rennie.

Last summer he signed a new contract at the Stadium of Light but that deal was just as much about protecting his future value as tying him down to north-east England. Under the terms of a sell-on clause inserted in the agreement reached with Dortmund, Sunderland will be due 15% of his next transfer fee.If, as expected, Bellingham passes certain milestones in Germany, and the fee increases to £32m, it will break Sunderland’s record for an outbound transfer, established by Jordan Pickford’s £30m sale to Everton in 2017. It would also make him Dortmund’s most expensive acquisition, narrowly eclipsing the sum they invested in Ousmane Dembélé in 2016.In an interview with the French radio station RMC last week Régis Le Bris, the Sunderland manager, was unstinting in his praise for Bellingham. “The player is incredibly interesting,” Le Bris said. “He’s still very young and has enormous room for improvement. But his personality is also great; he’s extremely competitive, extremely intense. Jobe is a guy with a wonderful personality. It’s been a wonderful encounter.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Spalletti made the announcement at a press conference in the wake of Friday’s 3-0 defeat in Oslo, a humiliating start to the visitors’ World Cup qualifying campaign, saying that Gabriele Gravina, the president of the Italian football federation (FIGC), had informed him of the decision on Saturday.England were dismal against minnows Andorra but it really doesn’t matter | Jonathan WilsonRead more“Last night we were together with president Gravina. He told me that I will be relieved of my position as coach of the national team,” Spalletti said. “I had no intention of giving up. I would have preferred to stay in my place and continue doing my job. I’ll be there tomorrow evening against Moldova, then we’ll resolve the contract.”Spalletti’s apparent dismissal comes after less than two years in the role, having replaced Roberto Mancini and taken charge in September 2023. While Spalletti took Italy to Euro 2024, their disappointing performance there had already put the manager under pressure.Italy went into the Euros last year in Germany as defending champions but after winning their opening game against Albania, they lost to Spain and snatched a late draw with Croatia to make the last 16, where they werebeaten 2-0 by Switzerland.View image in fullscreenLuciano Spalletti cuts an anguished figure as Italy lose 3-0 in Norway.Photograph: Emmanuele Mastrodonato/IPA Sport/ipa-agency.net/ShutterstockSpalletti’s side seemed to have recovered as they put in an impressive Nations League campaign, beating France 3-1 away and losing just once. They lost at home toLes Bleusin the final group game to finish behind France on goal difference.

The loss left Spalletti’s side already facing an uphill battle to secure automatic qualification for next year’s World Cup, and after Italy missed out on the last two finals, the FIGC decided to act.“I was convinced I could get to the World Cup and I remain convinced this national team can get there,” Spalletti said. “I love this shirt, the players I have coached, and tomorrow night I will ask them to show everything they have.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The recipient of the scholarship will also work with the Football Foundation outside their studies.‘Everything came so quick’: Jordon Ibe on Liverpool, trauma and starting afreshRead moreStephen Lawrence aspired to become an architect beforehe was murdered in a racist attackin the south London neighbourhood of Eltham in 1993 at the age of 18. He was also a keen Manchester United supporter and his mother, Doreen Lawrence, said the scholarship would be a “meaningful continuation” of his legacy.“Through the Stephen Lawrence Scholarship, Stephen’s legacy will continue to inspire and empower future generations, ensuring that his vision for equality, opportunity and justice lives on,” said Lady Lawrence, who holds an honorary doctorate at the university. “[It] will provide opportunities for the next generation and reinforce the vital role that education and sport can play in transforming communities.”The Football Foundation works to improve grassroots facilities in the sport, with an emphasis on “where the need is greatest and the greatest impact will be made”. It is funded by the Premier League, Football Association and UK government. Robert Sullivan, the organisation’s chief executive, said the scholarship would form part of its work to lower barriers to entry in the sport. “This initiative is the perfect legacy as we work to plan, design and construct facilities that target and support groups and communities who have faced barriers in terms of participation,” Sullivan said. “This includes lower socioeconomic groups and culturally and ethnically diverse communities. These facilities provide not only a great place to play but also a safe space for communities to come together, where people can meet and build friendships.”View image in fullscreenFormer footballer Paul Elliott helped to broker the scholarship deal between the Football Foundation and Greenwich University.Photograph: Linda Nylind/The GuardianA lack of representation for black and minority ethnic people within football continues to be an issue for the game. In 2022,data recorded by the Black Footballers Partnershipfound that 43% of players in the Premier League were black but only 4.4% of former players were in managerial roles in England. Meanwhile, only 1.6% of executive and leadership roles at men’s clubs were held by black people.Paul Elliott, the vice-chair of Charlton, which sits in the borough of Greenwich, helped to broker the scholarship deal. A long-term activist for racial equality in football, the former Celtic and Chelsea defender said: “This partnership between the University of Greenwich and the Football Foundation is a powerful example of what can be achieved when shared values and vision come together.“It has been a personal honour to help bring these organisations together in Stephen Lawrence’s name – uniting his passion for football with our collective commitment to creating inspiring spaces and life-changing opportunities for young people. Through the Stephen Lawrence Scholarship, we not only honour his legacy, but actively build on it, empowering a new generation.”Explore more on these topicsFootballStephen LawrencenewsShareReuse this content"

That he wants to challenge for trophies. That he has no interest in wasting what remains of his peak years jogging around aimlessly in the service of a vast public relations project, providing lucrative content for a cruel and heartless regime. Despite all this, he’s more than happy to remain at Manchester United for now.There were other angles to this decision. In a sense, Al-Hilal’s courtship of Fernandes represented a kind of catch-22 for United, desperate to reinforce their underperforming squad while remaining compliant with profitability and sustainability rules. Only a player who truly loved United could contemplate leaving in order to help balance the books. But in signalling his willingness to leave, Fernandes merely demonstrated why United could not possibly let him go.Dave Brailsford to step back from Manchester United and return to IneosRead moreHere, after all, is a player who has firmly established himself as one of the best midfielders in the world while playing for a team that has just finished 15th in the league, who so clearly adores this club and its people more than its parasitic owners ever will. But in this market everything has its price and for Al-Hilal – under the new management of Simone Inzaghi – that price was reported to be £100m in fees and around £50m a year in wages.Selling Fernandes would have been the easy way out for United: a huge fee for a 30-year-old on massive wages, which could then be reinvested in the rest of the squad. As it is, Fernandes will probably have to be accommodated – tactically and financially – alongside United’s two forward signings:Matheus Cunha from Wolvesand Bryan Mbeumo,who is in the process of being acquired from Brentford. How might Ruben Amorim blend these three richly gifted talents? And what trade-offs will need to be made in the process?The first statistic that jumps out is that Cunha and Mbeumo were first and third for xG overperformance in the 2024-25 Premier League season. To put it in lay terms: they scored 35 goals between them, whereas the average player presented with exactly the same chances would be expected to score 20.9 goals. So are these elite finishers? Well, neither player has remotely outperformed their xG to a similar extent before, which suggests their goal haul is more the result of temporary luck than sustainable class.View image in fullscreenBruno Fernandes has chosen to stay at Manchester United after rejecting an offer from Al-Hilal.Photograph: Fazry Ismail/EPAIn short: if United are signing Cunha or Mbeumo in expectation of a reliable 20-goal striker, they are likely to be disappointed. Mbeumo’s strength, historically, has been as a creative attacker rather than a pure target man: a link between midfield and attack, quick feet in the penalty area, a dainty dink to the back post. Interestingly, while he has outperformed his expected goals he has underperformed his expected assists for the first time. Mbeumo makes perfect sense as a foil for a deadlier finisher such as Yoane Wissa or Ivan Toney or Vincent Aboubakar with Cameroon. But he is not necessarily that deadly finisher himself.Cunha, for all his undoubted technical gifts and spectacular interventions for Wolves, fits the profile of an attacking midfielder more than a pure striker. He is at his most comfortable picking the ball up 40 yards out, combining with others, playing the killer through ball or shooting early from long range. Of all the players who have scored more than six goals in the Premier League season, only two – on average – took their shots from further out. One was Eberechi Eze. The other was Fernandes.What, then, is the wider strategy? Is it to convert the 5ft 7in Mbeumo into a No 9? Is it to provide the perfect platform for Rasmus Højlund? Is it to build a more fluid attacking model in which the front three in Amorim’s 3-4-3 can freely interchange and shift the point of attack, a system that somehow harnesses Mbeumo’s physicality and Cunha’s link play and both men’s ability to progress the ball in the opposition half? And if so, how does it respond against teams that do not allow United the space to transition and run from deep against them?skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Perhaps further signings will clarify the strategy. Perhaps in time United will come to resemble their 2020-21 iteration under Ole Gunnar Solskjær; a side largely set up on the transition, built around the pace of Marcus Rashford, Mason Greenwood and Anthony Martial, when Fernandes enjoyed the most singularly destructive season of his career.But all of this requires a certain leap of faith. Faith in the ability of Mbeumo and Cunha to continue their upward trajectory, to thrive in new more claustrophobic environments. Faith in the ability of Fernandes to adapt to what is likely to be a deeper and more disciplined role, with less scope for roaming all over the pitch. Faith in the United hierarchy to balance the books, to make the necessary sales in a market where everyone knows United have to sell.Above all it requires a faith in Amorim. To find the solutions that have been so scarce thus far. To be the coach United hired rather than the guy every United coach seems to become in the end: tired, jaded, fearful, resentful, a punchline pursued by viral Gary Neville clips.United’s age of dominance has gone. Their financial impregnability has gone. Their cash reserves have gone. Their swagger, their dignity, their proud sense of exceptionalism: all gone. In a way, blind faith may be all the modern United has left.Explore more on these topicsManchester UnitedTransfer windowRuben AmorimcommentShareReuse this content"

Slater will name a 20-man squad for Origin II on Monday morning, but Tom Dearden is expected to replace Cherry-Evans in the No 7 jersey in Perth next Wednesday.Beau Fermor is the other player dropped after the Maroons’ series-opening 18-6 loss at Suncorp Stadium, with Kurt Capewell set to replace him. Kurt Mann is then expected to take Dearden’s spot on the Maroons’ bench, after acting as 18th man in game one.Billy The Kid looks out of bullets as Maroons face another Origin defeat | Jack SnapeRead moreNotably, Slater has also called Ezra Mam into the Maroons’ extended squad, just three games into his return from a nine-match ban for drug driving. Mam is not expected to be part of Slater’s 17, and will need scans before entering camp after injuring his knee in Brisbane’s win over Gold Coast.Canberra prop Corey Horsburgh will also act as a reserve after missing out on a spot in the pack, while Melbourne centre Jack Howarth is also in the 20-man group.The Maroons are also confident prop Tino Fa’asuamaleaui will be fine to play, despite suffering a knock in the Titans’ loss to Brisbane on Saturday and requiring pain-killing injection to his sternum at halftime.The call to leave Cherry-Evans remains one of the most seismic in recent memory from either state. He has been the Maroons’ first-choice No 7 and captain since 2019, taking Queensland to three series wins, including their incredible 2020 effort.The 36-year-old has, however, come under fire since the Maroons’ loss in Origin I – their second straight defeat at Suncorp Stadium.Queensland has previously dropped Trevor Gillmeister when he was captain in the 1990s. NSW last year made the call to drop James Tedesco for Origin I, before recalling him through injury and then leaving him out again for game two.But neither state has decided to drop a captain from their side midway through a series this century. Cherry-Evans’ omission is even more significant considering only Wally Lewis, Darren Lockyer and Cameron Smith have captained more Origins for their state.Dearden has won two of four games starting for the Maroons at five-eighth, partnering Cherry-Evans last year and in the 2022 series-deciding win.Queensland lock Pat Carrigan said he believed the North Queensland playmaker would be ready for the challenge.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toAustralia SportFree newsletterGet a daily roundup of the latest sports news, features and comment from our Australian sports deskEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The 22-year-old’s latest injury ­concern came as she was preparing for the first women’s tournament at Queen’s Club for 52 years, and left her unable to practise for several days.It was Raducanu’s second back spasm in three weeks, after initially experiencing the problemagainst Danielle Collins in Strasbourga week before the French Open, and as a result she goes into the Queen’s Club event with low expectations.‘It’s a seminal moment’: Queen’s gears up for return of women’s tennis after 52 yearsRead more“Of course I want to win this tournament, like every tournament, but especially when it’s at home,” said Raducanu, who will play the ­Spaniard Cristina Bucsa in the first round on Tuesday. “But my expectations are pretty low, because I played points for the first time today, and I’ve had maybe two or three days on the grass courts, so it’s not been much.”Asked whether she was worried about it affecting her grass-court ­season, Raducanu replied: “I can’t really predict the future, and how it’s going to be. I know I’ve been managing my back for the last few weeks now. It’s something that comes and goes.“It can be frustrating. When I was playing in Strasbourg in my ­second‑round match it definitely hindered me, and in the first round in Paris when I got through. But I try not to let it get to me. I just have to manage it and take care of it when things happen.”Raducanu knows she faces a stacked field at Queen’s Club that includes thereigning Wimbledon champion, Barbora Krejcikova, the Olympic gold medallist Zheng ­Qinwen and the Australian Open ­winner, Madison Keys.View image in fullscreenEmma Raducanu is keeping her expectations low heading into the grass court season.Photograph: John Walton/PAHowever, her preparations were given a lift when her former coach Nick Cavaday, who left her camp for health reasons in January, returned to help her practise with her main coach Mark Petchey still at the French Open.“I’m happy to see Nick healthy, first of all,” ­Raducanu said. “It’s been a long time since we were last on court together in Australia, and Mark is in Paris commentating. Nick was around, and it is nice to have a few days with him.”The new WTA 500 tournament at Queen’s Club features an enhanced prize money of £1m ($1.4m), but the purse remains about half that of the men’s ATP 500 event, which begins next week. Raducanu did not want to be drawn on whether there should be more prize money between the men’s and women’s tour.“There is obviously a big difference, and I’m sure a lot of players will say their piece on it, but I prefer not to kind of get involved,” she said. “Whatever the situation is, I’ll kind of roll with it, but I’m never really going to take a stand, either way.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But I don’t feel like I really am playing for money. Of course, I need to sustain my team, which is extremely expensive. And with my kind of profile, coaches and team members see that. So it is a very expensive sport, but it’s not my ­motivation when I play.”As a child, Raducanu used to come to Queen’s Club with her father, although she conceded she was more interested in looking for ­brownies than watching the tennis. But now she admits she is delighted that women are finally back playing for the first time since 1973.“To be playing here is amazing. It’s the first time there’s been a women’s event for a very long time,” she said. “It’s going to be great to be playing on home turf with a good crowd.”On Monday, Raducanu will make only her second appearance in a WTA doubles tournament after agreeing to partner her fellow Briton Katie Boulter, with whom she has played in Billie Jean King matches.“It’ll be extremely special,” Boulter said. “Obviously, she’s a great player, and I’m looking forward to having the first of many more.”Explore more on these topicsEmma RaducanuTennisnewsShareReuse this content"

The MLS Players’ Association, the union representing MLS players, later confirmed they had received a proposal.According to the source, the league’s offer would see players earn 20% of a team’s performance-based prize money at each stage of the tournament with no agreed-upon cap on maximum payout. This means each group ofMLSplayers competing in the tournament would collectively receive $200,000 for a group stage draw (from a total prize of $1m), $400,000 for a group stage win (from a total prize of $2m per team, per win), $1.5m for making the Round of 16 (from a total prize of $7.5m) and so on.The players’ current bonus structure, outlined in the MLSPA’s collective bargaining agreement (CBA) with the league, allows MLS players to receive half of any prize or participation money awarded to a team competing in an outside tournament, but with a hard cap of $1m. With the Club World Cup’s $9.5m participation prize given to MLS teams, players had already maxed out their maximum payout and would have not been entitled to any more money for progress in the tournament.Cristiano Ronaldo will not play at Club World Cup despite ‘plenty of invitations’Read moreUnder the proposed terms, in the unlikely event an MLS team wins the Club World Cup, the players would be entitled to split a prize pool that would total up to $24.5m. Alternatively, if an MLS team loses all of its games at the Club World Cup, the players will still only receive a $1m collective bonus.Intheir own statement, the MLSPA confirmed that the proposal had been delivered but said that the 20% payout is “below the international standard,” and also said that the league has attempted to “strong-arm” the players into CBA waivers that do not regard the Club World Cup.The prize money structure was the subject of protest by theSeattle Sounderslast weekend, with the squad wearing T-shirts in the warmup reading “Club World Cup Cash Grab.” The MLSPA later said in a statement that the league had “failed to bring forward a reasonable proposal.”The source said that MLS had originally planned to propose the 20% arrangement on the following Monday, but then elected to delay delivering the proposal until Friday.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

However, Spurs finished 17th in thePremier League, their lowest position since 1977. The Guardian understands that Brentford’s Thomas Frank is the No 1 target for Spurs. He has a £10m release clause in his contract and would be open to an official approach.Pochettino enjoyed a successful run at Spurs from 2014 to 2019, challenging for the Premier League title in 2016 and advancing to the Champions League final in his last season. He was let go because of Tottenham’s league performance – the club were 14th at the time.Shorthanded United States let lead slip in soggy 2-1 defeat to TurkeyRead more“After I left [Tottenham] in 2019, every time [the manager position] is free … my name appeared on the list,” said Pochettino following the US’s 2-1 loss to Turkey in a friendly on Saturday afternoon. “If you have seen the rumours, I think we are 100 coaches on the list of the club. Don’t be worried about that. If something happens, we for sure will see. But we cannot talk about this type of thing because I think today it’s not real. I think it’s not realistic. And look – where I am, where we are? The answer is so clear, no?”Spurs have met with intermediaries to discuss a move for Frank, who has impressed with his stellar work at Brentford. The Dane took the reins in west London in October 2018 when they were in the Championship and got them promoted via the playoffs in 2020-21. He has established them in the top flight; they finished this past season 10th with 56 points.It helps Frank’s cause in regards to getting the Spurs job that the club’s technical director, Johan Lange, is also Danish and has a good relationship with the 51-year-old from their time working together at Danish club Lyngby BK.Pochettino took over the US national team at the end of 2024 and has overseen a mixed bag of performances in his first nine months. Saturday’s friendly was seen mostly as a way to regain the team’s footing after a pair of far below-par outings in March’s Nations League finals, with the team losing to Panama and Canada and looking generally listless throughout.Even though they lost, the US played with far more verve against Turkey than they had in March. Pochettino has called in a younger and less-experienced squad for this summer’s games, with several of the team’s first-choice stars out – either by choice, for health reasons, for personal reasons, or due to their club’s participation in the Club World Cup. Jack McGlynn, one of those newcomers, opened the scoring on Saturday with a signature curling effort from outside the box. Later that half, two defensive miscues in about three minutes doomed the Americans, with both resulting in goals.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Such ingratitude,” he wrote on his X social media platform amid an ongoing feud with Donald Trump.When rightwing commentator Laura Loomer wrote that Republicans on Capitol Hill had been discussing whom to side with in the inter-party feud, Musk replied with a nod toward the long tail of his influence. “Oh and some food for thought as they ponder this question: Trump has 3.5 years left as President, but I will be around for 40+ years … ,” Musk wrote on X.Billionaires in the US often seek to influence politics in big and small ways, throwing their money and influence around to extract what they want from the government. But few are as explicit and influential as Musk has proven in the past year – and it’s showing just how transactional and broken US governance has become.The Trump-Musk battle exemplifies the post-Citizens United picture of US politics: the world’s richest person paid handsomely to elect his favored candidate, then took a formal, if temporary, role with a new governmental initiative created for him that focused on dismantling parts of the government he didn’t like.We’re sitting ringside to a fight between the mega-rich president and the far richer Republican donor to see who can cut more services from the poor. As onesatirical websiteput it: “Aw! These Billionaires Are Fighting Over How Much Money to Steal From Poor People.”Fifteen years ago, the US supreme court ruled that corporations and outside groups could spend as much as they wanted on elections. In thatruling, conservative justice Anthony Kennedy said: “The appearance of influence or access, furthermore, will not cause the electorate to lose faith in our democracy.”In the years since, it’s become clear that these infusions of wealth have eroded democracy, with Musk’s ostentatious example accelerating an already out-of-control level of money in politics. Muskspentnearly $300m to elect Trump in 2024. It’s the billionaire’s government now.“Fifteen years after that decision, we’re seeing the full culmination of living under a Citizens United world – where it’s not just elections that are for sale, but it’s that our entire government, and the apparatus of our government, is up for sale,” Tiffany Muller, the president of End Citizens United,told the Bulwark earlier this year.Musk isn’t alone here:in races up and down the ballot, ultra-rich donors are throwing around their cash to get their favored candidates elected. This is the standard state of play for politics in the US now, in both political parties. Bernie Sanders confronted Democrats at their convention last year to say: “Billionaires in both parties should not be able to buy elections, including primary elections.”Earlier this year, Musk poured big money into a Wisconsin judicial election, but lost to the Democratic candidate. And he’ssentsmall-dollar donations to Republicans who wanted to go after judges who ruled against the Trump administration. The threat of his money, even if it is uneven and has an inconsistent success record, looms large for both political parties.But, by virtue of his unelected role, Musk couldn’t do as much as he wanted to stop Trump’s signature spending bill – or so it seems so far. Trump’s “big, beautiful bill” didn’t cut enough spending or favor Musk enough or otherwise meet his litmus test for a budget. And when the administration stopped working for him, he turned on it, blazing out the door in a chaotic fashion.It’s a fitting coda to the uneasy alliance between Trump and Musk that started with a warm embrace and front-row status for the ultra-wealthy when Trump took office. The fact that Musk holds such sway over the budget process is in itself corruption. Trump has said Musk knew what was in the bill, the undertone being that the administration sought his approval before the public explosion.Musk embraced a brawling style of political spending that is rare among the uber-wealthy, who tend to let their money speak louder than their public words. One expert in philanthropypreviously told the GuardianMusk stood out because of his “complete eschewal of discretion as a mode of political engagement”.Musk is now rallying his followers on X to reach out to their members of Congress and kill the bill, a quest that could be successful, depending on how Republican lawmakers shake out when they’re forced to decide between their ideologue president and a megadonor known for his vindictiveness.In rightwing media, the feud has created a chasm.On Breitbart, one commentator noted how Trump was “sticking his finger in the eye of his biggest donor and that never happens”. Inthe American Spectator, one writer opined that Musk did not elect Trump: “the American people did.” But in the pages ofthe Washington Examiner, Musk’s stance on the bill was praised because Trump’s budget plan “deserves to die”.“I don’t mind Elon turning against me, but he should have done so months ago,” Trump wrote to cap off a series of posts and public comments about Musk. Musk has “lost his mind”, the presidentsaidin a TV interview Friday.So far, Republican officials are lining up behind Trump. “President Trump has done more than any person in my lifetime to earn the trust of the movement he leads,” JD Vance said.If Musk ultimately loses, he could take his money and run elsewhere. He floated the idea of creating a third political party, a prospect that’s been tried many times before but without the wealth infusion and bully pulpit he’d offer to the cause. Democrats, themselves quite reliant on rich donors, will lobby for him to switch sides. The Democratic representativeRo Khannasuggestedthe party should “be in a dialogue” with Musk.Although Khanna, who represents Silicon Valley and has called for the left to embrace economic populism, saw intense backlash against his comments from his party, he doubled down.“If Biden had a big supporter criticize him, Trump would have hugged him the next day,” he wrote on X. “When we refused to meet with @RobertKennedyJr, Trump embraced him & won. We can be the party of sanctimonious lectures, or the party of FDR that knows how to win & build a progressive majority.”Explore more on these topicsElon MuskTrump administrationUS politicsRepublicansanalysisShareReuse this content"

But it was email spam from one of the major political parties that she thought she could do something about.Political parties are exempt from privacy law, so they have no obligation to tell individuals how they find your data, and there is no way to opt out.Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailBut the Australian National University data science academic had a clue: the emails were addressed to a fake name she had used for online purchases years ago – a name also used when she received spam from one of the minor political parties in 2020.“It looks like it’s come from a transaction,” she says. “It would likely be some sort of online e-commerce transaction, or energy transaction or something like that.”Tracking down how organisations gain access to individual contact information is “really hard with political parties because they just ignore you,” Dev says. “If I can find out the origin of my data from this mission, it would be really amazing.”Google releases new tool to enable Australians to find their personal information and request removalRead moreIt’s the second time Dev has attempted to track how someone got her data, working through the labyrinthine web of data brokers who – often without our awareness – buy and sell information on the public to advertisers or others who want to know more about us.Last year, after receiving dozens of unwanted calls,Dev was able to track who held her phone numberback to real estate giant CoreLogic Australia, who told her they had been able to legitimately buy her data from another data broker firm in 2023, who had bought her data from another data broker in 2016.That company told her it obtained her data through a 2014 marketing campaign and had probably passed on her information to at least 50 other companies.Dev’s experience is not an isolated one. Crikeyreported in Aprilthat a child’s email address that was signed up for a charity fundraiser more than a decade ago received Liberal party political spam at the most recent election.How did you get my number?The answer to how marketers and others find out your contact details and other personal information is a complicated one.Katharine Kemp, an associate professor who leads the public interest law and tech initiative at the University of New South Wales, says it often occurs through a data-matching service that joins up your personal information across different service providers who then sell that via data brokers.Kemp said she had the experience where a mortgage broker had called her asking if she was in the market for a mortgage – she suspects they got her information from a real estate agent during an open house visit.But finding out how they got that information can often be hard, Kemp says.When she asks those who contact her where they got her details, “they will obfuscate or sometimes just immediately hang up or … give a silly answer, and then when you press them, they very quickly end the call.”The federal privacy commissioner, Carly Kind, describes the data broking industry in general terms as “very opaque”, with “a very complex value chain of personal information”.“So because people don’t really know what’s going on, they’re not really empowered to complain about it,” she says.“I think people find it creepy, the way in which their personal information has been passed around through data brokers and ends up in places that they don’t expect.”Who are data brokers, and what do they collect?One global data broker organisation has described its work as “enabling the exchange of information between businesses in the consumer interest and in the support of Australian corporates and small businesses,” according to a 2023 submission to the Australian consumer watchdog’s inquiry into data brokering.Information collected includes names, addresses, age, browsing behaviour, purchasing behaviour, financial status, employment, qualification, tenancy history and other socioeconomic and demographic information.View image in fullscreenDev says there needs to be a debate about extending privacy obligations to political parties, which would force them to be transparent about how they acquire personal data.Photograph: Hilary Wardhaugh/The GuardianA Reset.Tech Australiareport last yearfound the types of data bought and sold by brokers could include location and movements over time, sexual interests, financial concerns, banking and utility providers, personal problems, gambling or drinking habits, and recent online purchases.Data broker companies include credit reporting companies, fraud and identity verification companies, news corporations, property companies, tenancy data brokers, marketers, loyalty programs, and social media platforms.Australians ‘uncomfortable’ with personal information being soldThe Australian Competition and Consumer Commission foundin its report last year on data brokeringthat privacy policies used by companies to allow the sharing of data can use “ambiguous language”, making it hard for consumers to identify who their data is being shared with and for what purposes. They also make it harder, the report found, for people to figure out who holds their data and to opt out of its collection.The average number of words in a typical privacy policy is 6,876 and it would take 29 minutes to read, the report found.Research conducted as part of the report found 74% of Australians are uncomfortable with the idea of their personal information being shared or sold.Some companies seek to downplay concern and privacy obligations – such as providing data held on a person by request – by de-identifying the data collected on consumers. Consumer group Choicefound last yeardata brokers claimed to not hold data on consumers who were members of their loyalty programs, with names taken off the data held.Third-party providers a customer data ‘weak spot’, Australian privacy commissioner saysRead moreKind, the privacy commissioner, says the assertion that de-identified data may not be considered personal information under thePrivacyAct could be “creative interpretation” of the law by the companies collecting such data.The ACCC said de-identified data still carries risks of consumers being identified when combined with data points from other sources.Kind, speaking generally and without naming any companies in particular, said many Australians would find some of the practices of some data brokers to be “quite uncomfortable to say the least, and often veering on affronting or outrageous”.“The data is changing hands numerous times. So it is a very complex space, and I think undoubtedly, a big chunk of it is legitimate and in compliance with the [privacy] act. But that’s quite fuzzy – where that stops and where less legitimate activity starts.”Regulator could flex its muscleThe ACCC report did not make any recommendations, but supported the implementation of strengthened privacy laws in Australia.Kind says the ACCC’s work has cleared the way for her office to begin looking into the practices of the sector, saying the Privacy Act today “has many elements which could be applied to data brokers to rein in their practices”.“It’s an issue that I’m keen to prioritise and my regulatory team is currently looking into potentially using our powers in this space,” Kind says.Dev says there needs to be a debate about extending the privacy obligations to political parties, which would force them to be transparent with the public about how they acquire personal data.The exemption means that political parties do not have to respond to her requests about what data they hold on her, Dev says.Kemp says she thinks there is some prospect of tighter rules around data brokering, but there will be no appetite from politicians to change the law on political party obligations.“But I don’t think we should give up on it as an issue in an area that requires reform.”Explore more on these topicsPrivacyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Altmanwas fired by the boardover claims he was not “consistently candid” in his communications and the board did not have confidence in Altman’s ability to lead.English-speaking countries more nervous about rise of AI, polls suggestRead moreThe chaotic months that followed saw Altman fired and then re-hired with three members of the board, including Toner, ousted instead. They will soon also be thesubject of a planned film, with the director of Challengers and Call Me By Your Name, Luca Guadagnino, reportedly in talks to direct.The saga,according to Time magazine– which named her one of the top 100 most influential people on AI in 2024 – resulted in the Australian having “the ear of policymakers around the world trying to regulate AI”.At CSET, Toner has a team of 60 people working on AI research for white papers or briefing policymakers focused on the use of AI in the military, workforce, biosecurity and cybersecurity sectors.“A lot of my work focuses on some combination of AI, safety and security issues, the Chinese AI ecosystem and also what gets calledfrontier AI,” Toner said.Toner said the United States is concerned about losing the AI race to China and whileUS chip export controlsmake it harder for China to get compute power to compete with the US, the country was still making a “serious push” on AI, as highlighted by the surprise success of Chinese generative AI model DeepSeekearlier this year.The Trump administration’sattacks on researchandbans on international studentsare a “gift” to China in the AI race with the US, Toner said.“Certainly it’s a great gift to [China] the way that the US is currently attacking scientific research, and foreign talent – which is a huge proportion of the USA workforce – is immigrants, many of them coming from China,” she said.Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email“That is a big … boon to China in terms of competing with the US.”The AI boom has led to claims and concerns about a job wipeout caused by companies using AI to replace work that had otherwise been done by humans. Dario Amodei, the CEO of Anthropic, the company behind the generative AI model Claude, told Axioslast weekthat AI could reduce entry-level white-collar jobs by 50% and result in 20% unemployment in the next five years.Toner said Amodei “often says things that seem directionally right to me, but in terms of … timeline and numbers often seem quite aggressive” but added that disruption in the jobs market had already started to show.“The kind of things that [language model-based AI] can do best at the moment … if you can give them a bite-size task – not a really long-term project, but something that you might not need ages and ages to do and something where you still need human review,” she said. “That’s a lot of the sort of work that you give to interns or new grads in white-collar industries.”Experts have suggestedcompanies that invested heavily in AI are now being pressed to show the results of that investment. Toner said while the real-world use of AI can generate a lot of value, it is less clear what business models and which players will benefit from that value.Dominant uses might be a mix of different AI services plugged into existing applications – such as phone keyboards that can now transcribe voices – as well as stand-alone chatbots, but it’s “up in the air” which type of AI would actually dominate, she said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

And when it comes to cars, the alternative is thousands of people dying per year.“If you can improve on that, that’s amazing.

But our mania for founder myths obscures an ideology of inequalityAlice BolinSun 8 Jun 2025 09.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 8 Jun 2025 19.47 EDTShareView image in fullscreenOne Saturday in the spring of 2021, a little achy after receiving our first doses of the Covid-19 vaccine, my husband and I decided to stay in bed and click on the first thing suggested to us by our TV. It wasWeWork: Or the Making and Breaking of a $47 Billion Unicorn, a documentary produced by Hulu about the New York startup WeWork’s spectacular fall from grace. The film mostly chronicles the misdeeds of founder Adam Neumann, the surfer-dude dolt who turned a good idea – co-working spaces that lease small offices to tech startups – into a surreally overvalued conglomerate, before he made a mortifying attempt to take the company public that eventually ended in his forced resignation. As a consolation prize, Neumann infamously received a $1.7bn golden parachute.The WeWork cautionary tale is partly about slick marketing, which is what seems to have convinced its investors that it was a tech startup. Neumann tried to position WeWork as something much more than a real estate company: he borrowed the tech industry’s idealistic language about changing the world but upped the ante, insisting that the company’s sole mission was “elevat[ing] the world’s consciousness”.This is a smart idea when trying to keep billionaire investors’ money spigots flowing. A real estate flipper has a finite worth, based on markets, profits and expenses, but a company that “elevates the world’s consciousness”, well, who knows where they might go with it? There is evidence, though, that WeWork executives were starting to buy into their own marketing – to get high, so to speak, on their own supply. As Gabriel Shermanwrites in Vanity Fair, Neumann was known to make insane pronouncements about “wanting to be elected president of the world, live forever, and become humanity’s first trillionaire”. When SoftBank CEO and future WeWork investor Masayoshi Son met Neumann, he asked him: “In a fight, who wins – the smart guy or the crazy guy?” “Crazy guy,” Neumann answered.WeWork pushed its romantic origin story, which involved Neumann and co-founder Miguel McKelvey’s idyllic childhoods thousands of miles apart: Neumann on a kibbutz in Israel, McKelvey on a hippie commune in Oregon. From this formative experience of communal living, so the story went, they created WeWork – what Neumann described with the impossible concept of the “capitalist kibbutz”.View image in fullscreenMovie still featuring Adam Neumann from WeWork: Or the Making and Breaking of a $47 Billion Unicorn (2021).Photograph: Everett Collection Inc/AlamyThese canned origin stories are what passes for good storytelling in an age when we are eager to swallow anything tech jams down our throats. And tech is only the most recent phenomenon that has made us simps for narratives about powerful men and how they got that way. This is a tendency that seems rooted particularly in American DNA, one that has been exploited for centuries to rope people into wars, cults and scams – with our unjust societal status quo being the greatest scam of all. Our obsession with brute power has gotten us where we are now, a system where nearly 100% of American wealth is concentrated in the hands of a few men, one of whom has ascended to the highest political office (twice!) to become our very own authoritarian strongman.View image in fullscreenSympathy for the assholeNeumann fashioned himself after the spiritual tech-guy archetype, like the shadow side of Jack Dorsey from Twitter, whose Buddhist renunciation act contrasted dissonantly with the famously toxic website he founded. But Neumann has his own shadow in Billy McFarland, the con artist laughingstock who took entrepreneurial speculative fiction to Icarian heights with his Fyre festival. The 26-year-old McFarland and the rapper Ja Rule went all in on a pipe dream to hold a luxury music festival on what was once Pablo Escobar’s private island in the Bahamas. Marketing the festival on social media was their sole concern – they reportedly paid Kendall Jenner $250,000 for an Instagram post – when it could have been food, bathrooms and housing for their 5,000 ticket holders.When their guests arrived, instead of luxury villas on a deserted private island, they found hurricane tents and inflatable mattresses on a residential construction site. The privileged would-be concertgoers spent a terrifying night of Lord of the Flies-style chaos in the tents before the festival was canceled, prompting schadenfreude the likes of which Twitter had rarely seen.I’m not saying that McFarland, who was released in 2022 after serving four years in prison for fraud, is the same as any other tech entrepreneur, but it’s easy to see how the tech market draws con artists like roaches to grease. For one thing, McFarland was punished not for defrauding his customers – whom he put in serious danger, in addition to stealing their money – but his billionaire investors. Once again, the flows and reversals of capital float above real life, with all our ant-like obsession with cause and effect and human suffering.The Social Network [was] created by a team of men who have internalized the myth of their own temperamental geniusOne of Silicon Valley’s most dearly held and deleterious myths is of its boy geniuses. McFarland reportedly idolized Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg, and I would be willing to bet that he styled himself not only on the real Zuckerberg but on Zuckerberg as he was fictionalized by the screenwriter Aaron Sorkin in 2010’s The Social Network, one of the most influential documents in shaping the narrative of Web 2.0. My husband and I also watched The Social Network while laid up from the vaccine. I had never seen it before, and more than 10 years after it was made amid a tech backlash with its target squarely on Zuckerberg and Facebook, I found the movie’s tone strange, as it portrayed Zuckerberg as a manipulative misogynist who is nevertheless one of the visionary geniuses of our times. As Zadie Smith pointed out in her 2010 essay on the film,Generation Why?, this does not really conform with what we know of Zuckerberg, who is so bland that his only explanation for why he invented Facebook, beyond a mystical fixation on the word “connection”, is that he liked “building things”.The unwitting assault on democracy, community and the human sense of self by a bunch of college sophomores who liked building things is not a bad story, but it’s clear why it is not the one that Sorkin chose. AsMark Harris wrote in New Yorkmagazine in 2010, the film’s central narrative question could be stated as: “What exactly does it mean to be an asshole?” Women in the film’s first and last beats tell Zuckerberg that he either is or isn’t an asshole, and in the intervening two hours, he confidently fucks people over like an oblivious poster in the Am I the Asshole? subreddit.But this does not make him a villain; it is more of his tragic flaw. One must imagine that Elon Musk has done some of this same rationalizing as he has gone from being hailed as the real-life Iron Man to his new role as Twitter’s head troll and eviscerator of the American federal government at Doge. Moving fast and breaking things means some people will think you’re an asshole. Or maybe you have to be an asshole to be effective – assholes are the real good guys! Harris innocently reports in New York that Sorkin and the film’s director, David Fincher, relate to Zuckerberg, having “been at some point in their professional lives on the receiving end of the word asshole”. The Social Network’s alternate title could be Sympathy for the Asshole, having been created by a team of men who have internalized the myth of their own temperamental genius and are intoxicated by stories of others who have done the same.This is a favorite theme of Sorkin, who has become the go-to screenwriter for contemporary “Great Man” stories. His Steve Jobs, from the biopicSteve Jobs, is a total dick, questioning his daughter’s paternity in the national press and screwing over his collaborators and mentors. And still his genius is assured, if ineffable: in one scene, Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak blows up at Jobs, telling him: “How come 10 times in a day, I read Steve Jobs is a genius? What do you do?” Jobs’s response is that his inability to write code is irrelevant since he is like a conductor, “play[ing] the orchestra”, coordinating technicians under his sweeping business vision.View image in fullscreenPosters from The Social Network (2010) and Steve Jobs (2015).Composite: Sony Pictures, Universal StudiosTech founders’ self-belief is broadcast by the geniuses they name their businesses after: Tesla is a conspicuous example, and Apple is, of course, a nod to Isaac Newton.Steve Jobsand The Social Network are full of mini-monologues about the future of computing and the lives of historical Great Men like Alan Turing, creating little biopics within biopics.Intelligence is signified in Sorkin’s work by simply knowing a lot of facts, and his nerd heroes are often being asked difficult trivia questions so that they can answer them correctly, like the sixth-grade brownnosers they once were. As Joan Didion said of Woody Allen’s characters in 1979: “They reflect exactly the false and desperate knowingness of the smartest kid in the class,” but at least Allen’s characters are just dilettante writers with teenage girlfriends, not the supposed incarnations of the spirit of American innovation. This juvenile intelligence and ruthlessness seem to go hand in hand. One of the leitmotifs of Sorkin’s tech biopics is, as I am sure he read on brainyquote.com: “Great artists steal.” Zuckerberg and Jobs in his movies are defiant about their practice of plundering other people’s hard work. This Sorkin does not exactly share with them, since his biopics are ahistorical fantasies, telling stories that are mostly Sorkin’s own invention.“I’m really weak when it comes to plot,” Sorkin told New York. “With nothing to stop me, I’ll write pages and pages of snappy dialogue that don’t add up to anything.” By seizing on poetic license, he can push those popular narratives even further, plating up the Zuckerberg and Jobs of our dreams, our very own assholes to rival the assholes of history such as Henry Ford, Thomas Edison and Walt Disney. Sorkin’s appeal is not to artistic ingenuity but national pride, creating corporate propaganda so satisfying that his lines from The Social Network have become tech truisms – “we lived on farms, then we lived in cities, now we’re going to live on the internet” – reshaping reality around itself.We should no longer blindly celebrate people for so low and ambiguous a bar as ‘changing the world’I can admit that this version of the Facebook story is easier to face than the truth. As Smith writes in Generation Why?, Facebook was a haphazard invention, with little thought given to its look or function, reducing all of us in the end to the 19-year-old who invented it. There is a strange resonance with Smith’s unanswerable questions – “Why? Why Facebook? … Why do it like that?” she asks. The granddaddy of all tech scams, Enron, the energy provider turned online trading marketplace whose unironic motto was: “Ask why.” In addition to wreaking havoc on Texas and California energy sectors (damage that, in our climate change–addled present, we are still suffering from), Enron’s executives were maestros of fake accounting, hiding billions of dollars in debt to keep the firm’s stock price high before its epic collapse in 2001. The definitive book on the Enron scandal, adapted into a documentary with the same name, is calledEnron: The Smartest Guys in the Room, and its executives loved to congratulate themselves for their intelligence, casting it as the means to justify any sordid ends.In a Sorkinist reading of history, American progress is safe-guarded because the assholes we endow with great power are inoculated with visionary genius. But intelligence, popularly taken to mean devious cleverness or maybe just privilege, has never been synonymous with moral goodness, and we should no longer blindly celebrate people for so low and ambiguous a bar as “changing the world”. Why? Why Facebook? Why Enron? Why is our economy an unregulated wasteland of self-dealing, where theft is not an aberration but the very foundation of the world’s greatest fortunes? Musk has become the archetypal tech founder not only for his passion for self-beatification – he revived the dream of space travel! And he makeselectriccars! – but now also for his Dr Evil-style eccentricity and megalomania, essentiallybuying controlof the federal government, which he spent four months haphazardly decimating.Tech is only the latest sector to take cover in the American mania for founder myths, with the virtual requirement that they be mostly made up. (Elizabeth Holmes, the sociopathic founder of the fraudulent medical startup Theranos and one of Silicon Valley’s few girl geniuses, courted investors with a falsified sob story about her uncle dying of skin cancer.) This narrative impulse comes from our own epic origin story, our misplaced pride in the genius of the founding fathers that has become one of the main stagnating forces of American government.Our stubborn American social structure, where wealth and political power are so ludicrously concentrated, was seemingly incarnated in the founders, some of the smartest guys of the 18th century, whose inspiring opening salvo, a poetic ode to all men being created equal, was maybe more marketing than actual game plan. With this, they got the foreign policy apparatus of France to buy into what might be the most ambitious and visionary startup venture of all time: the United States of America. The figures of the founders are narcotizing antidotes to the reformer spirit; depictions of them as revolutionaries foreclose any further revolution as redundant. It is no wonder they are foisted on us by the entire spectrum of cultural gatekeepers, including politicians, publishing, Disney, the Tonys, the Grammys and the Pulitzer prize.Why else would we be so taken in by the romanticized story of our most corrupt and problematic founding father? Yes, you know the one.View image in fullscreenWho tells your story?Lin-Manuel Miranda got the idea for his musical Hamilton when he bought a copy of Ron Chernow’s biography of the founding father at the airport. “When I encountered Alexander Hamilton I was immediately captivated,” Miranda said. “He’s an inspirational figure to me. And an aspirational one.” Miranda has popularized the fantasy that Hamilton’s was a New York immigrant story, like those of Miranda’s parents, who moved to New York from Puerto Rico. But Hamilton was not an immigrant as we now think of them: he did move to New York from the Caribbean, but as an English citizen moving between two of England’s colonies. (Despite having American citizenship, Puerto Ricans living in the United States are seen as more “foreign” than Hamilton would have been.) And disregarding rumors kicked up by the musical’s popularity, he was white.Miranda’s casting of the founding fathers with Black and Hispanic actors was a stroke of genius, since it clouded Hamilton’s politics in a confusion so profound that few people felt like questioning them. One might even forget to notice that the musical portrays no actual people of color. As the historianLyra D Monteirowrote in The Public Historian, Hamilton repackages the same myths of the founders that we have received from time immemorial, particularly the myth that white men were the only people of any importance living in America during this time.View image in fullscreenLin-Manuel Miranda (center) and the cast of Hamilton perform at the 58th Grammy awards on 15 February 2016 in New York City.Photograph: Theo Wargo/WireImage/Getty ImagesDespite his overtures to the subjectivity of history, with the final song inHamiltonrepeating the question: “Who lives, who dies, who tells your story?” Miranda misses the irony – that he has perpetuated a narrative by white men about white men, because the founder biography is an essentially white genre, especially the ones you can buy at the airport.Maybe I’m crazy, but as I sat down to watch the live version made available on Disney+, I assumed that a hip-hop musical about the founding fathers would be at least somewhat tongue-in-cheek, poking holes in our pieties about the founders. Instead, I watched a very long and self-serious biography of Hamilton, with a sentimentality about its subject worthy of the Walt Disney Company. This combination – a performance of diversity crossed with the familiar sanding down of the sharper edges of American history – makes Hamilton “one of the most brilliant propaganda pieces in theatrical history”, as Matt Stoller writes, and one, if Disney has anything to say about it, that will be shown to schoolchildren annually for the rest of forever.The shifting popular image of Hamilton is itself a gauge of the relative strength of democratic institutions at any given momentMatt StollerStoller’s essayThe Hamilton Hustle from the Baffleris an exhaustive and illuminating rundown of all of Alexander Hamilton’s faults and misdeeds. Hamilton not only was in favor of centralized government but was vehemently anti-democracy, calling the American people “a great beast”. Instead, he envisioned a United States run by an elite coalition of wealthy financiers and military officers, and much of his career was dedicated to fucking over the small farmers who formed the majority of the American population. And while Chernow presents Hamilton as an abolitionist, he married into a family of slaveholders and sold enslaved people himself.Hamilton’s authoritarianism had long-lasting effects, eviscerating the economic power of the middle classes and creating stratification and inequality that we still recognize today. It is baffling that educated, progressive people so willingly accepted Miranda’s fairytale about the father of modern finance so soon after the 2008 financial crisis, in which the craven stupidity of Wall Street bankers nearly caused global economic collapse. But this may be exactly why Hamilton was such a phenomenon. As Stoller writes, Hamilton is so resilient a figure in the American popular consciousness that “the shifting popular image of Hamilton is itself a gauge of the relative strength of democratic institutions at any given moment”– that is, the more popular Hamilton is, the less healthy American democracy is.Hamilton the musical exemplifies a familiar leftist critique of contemporary liberalism: that the appearance of progress, particularly involving narratives about “strong women” and “breaking down historic barriers”, stands in for the real thing. With this frame, Hamilton is the quintessential Obama-era document, with Obama’s secretary of the treasury, Timothy Geithner, calling Hamilton the “original Mr Bailout”. Geithner’s blanket bailout of the big banks, with the architects of the financial crisis going totally unpunished, was a travesty we are only beginning to reckon with, but one thing it did for certain is pass the baton of bank-friendly economic policies between the Bush and Obama administrations, with Obama’s innovation being an even closer relationship with tech founders, the titans of our new Gilded Age.Barack and Michelle Obama have said of their greatest strength: “One way of looking at what we’ve both been doing for the last 20 years, maybe most of our careers, was to tell stories.” This is true, and they are maybe a little too good at it. Maybe this is why I am a bit grumpy about the Obamas’ choice to start a film and TV production company with their post-White House popularity, moving decisively into the realm where they have always most excelled: celebrity. Their company is called Higher Ground Productions, which they claim is an ode to Stevie Wonder, but this phrase inevitably evokes Michelle Obama’s catchphrase on the 2016 campaign trail: “When they go low, we go high.” This policy of tight-lipped civility was no match for the emergency of the Trump moment – it’s embarrassing when one thinks of how low we have sunk from there – but it was a savvy act of image preservation, one that ensured that the Obamas would weather the Trump era unscathed, no matter if the rest of us will.Just as it is for Silicon Valley founders, for the Obamas, “good storytelling” is synonymous with good branding. And, of course, big streaming companies such as Netflix, whom the Obamas’ production company signed an eight-figure deal with in 2018, do not see their “content” as separate from the demands of marketing. To them, good stories are the ones people want to hear because they’ve heard them before, thus the knockoffs they produce of all their most popular shows: iterating, iterating, iterating. Who lives, who dies, who tells your story?View image in fullscreenWho wins?Since I wrote the first draft of this piece in 2021, there have been so many tech scandals and meltdowns that I have been able to shoehorn in only a few of them here, and it is interesting how we seem to have as healthy an appetite for stories of tech villains as those of tech founders. Sam Bankman-Fried makes a great story whether he’s the barefoot CEO giving all his money away or the incompetent crook gambling with his investors’ savings. We love Musk whether he’s exploring space or destroying Twitter (now X) and the American administrative state. It’s the ultimate postmodern nightmare, where truth and taste are not only contested but irrelevant.One simple reason that documentaries have abounded in the past 10 years – particularly notable was the release of two competing Fyre festival documentaries at the exact same time – is because of the amount of video footage that now exists of basically everyone since the rise of reality television and the iPhone. Social media feeds exemplify the total victory of spectacle over argument, a stream of unlimited, barely distinguishable content, narrativeless and authored by everyone. We look at the dominance of social media apps and start seeking the Great Men behind them, completely ignoring the billions of users who have donated their time, confessions and creativity to make them compelling.The fickle winds of marketing may finally be blowing against these self-styled Great MenOne sees this startlingly with HBO’s documentary series Q: Into the Storm, which seeks out the men behind the mega-conspiracy theory QAnon. The documentary film-maker Cullen Hoback had remarkable access to Jim and Ron Watkins, the father-son duo in the Philippines who ran the anonymous message board 8chan, where Q, a supposed “deep-state” operative, posted warnings of a cabal of powerful pedophiles who can only be stopped by a heroic PresidentDonald Trump. Hoback comes to the same conclusion that many other journalists already have, that Ron Watkins had been writing Q’s posts since 2017, and that both Jim and Ron had heavy interests in promoting QAnon.But Q was never one person: Ron Watkins did not originate the persona, and the anonymous message board that was QAnon’s birthplace was crucial for its development, as a kind of collaborative fiction written by a web of different authors.QAnonis a case study in the power of emergence, though it is all in service to perhaps the least deserving and most powerful Great Man on the planet: Trump. In terms of sheer people power, it acts like a microcosm of social media or even the United States itself, this concentration of human ingenuity misdirected to benefit people who are already rich and powerful. This is another way of saying, as my Marxist brother tells me, that workers create value, even as regular people have so little power in this time of inequality, price increases, stagnant wages, environmental injustice and war.View image in fullscreenVideo images of Donald Trump before his speech to supporters, at the Ellipse at the White House in Washington, on 6 January 2021 as Congress prepares to certify electoral college votes.Photograph: Bill Clark/CQ-Roll Call, Inc/Getty ImagesThe current billionaire class has more power than any human beings have ever had, and they wield it with remarkably little responsibility. Billionaires must be cut down to size through every means possible, from breaking up monopolies to tax reform to financial regulation to union drives. But we also need to stop swallowing these Great Man stories whole and recognize them for what they are: an ideology of dominance. I do not exaggerate when I say that this ideology is not only impoverishing the narratives available to us but endangering human lives and the future of civilization.But the wheel is beginning to turn. Tech billionaires’ public image is in the toilet, with these former “visionaries” seeming ever more embarrassing, monomaniacal, shortsighted and pathetic. This is true of Trump, too, whose bizarre and ever-changing tariff policies led to awful approval ratings almost as soon as his second term started. Of course, we could have said this in the fall of 2024, too, when he was making rambling speeches about Hannibal Lecter and interrupting campaign events to sway sleepily to Ave Maria – none of which was enough to cost him the election.The fickle winds of marketing may finally be blowing against these self-styled Great Men, but they know more keenly than anyone that all publicity is good publicity: McFarland was recently back in the news, capitalizing on the attention garnered by his notorious failures, claiming he wanted to host a Fyre festival 2. It will take more than our disapproval to stop them all from failing up like Neumann, who was so incompetent that he got paid more than a billion dollars to quit his job.Who wins, the smart guy or the crazy guy? The crazy guy, and he’s getting crazier every day.Alice Bolin is the author of Dead Girls: Essays on Surviving an American Obsession and Culture Creep: Notes on the Pop Apocalypse, out this month.

If one isn’t available, soak in the sink first, to loosen particles, then take a dish brush or nail brush to it. Rinse under a fast hot tap.Aggie MacKenzie, TV presenter and authorCoffeethat clogsCoffee brewed with a French press leaves behind a slurry of grounds and water, and usually too much liquid for the kitchen bin. But coffee grounds can clog up plumbing and create major problems, which I learned the hard way. I now place a single paper towel over the sink waste and filter the grounds until they are dry enough for the trash.Brandon Wilks, Fairbanks,AlaskaDodgy dishwashersIf your dishwasher is not working well, it could be down to a simple blockage: something small enough to pass through the filter, but large enough to clog the spray arm holes from the inside. In my experience it’s either lemon pips or pine nuts. The two spray arms (some posh dishwashers have three) are easy to remove; shake over the sink, the pine nuts will dislodge and your dishwasher will clean like new again.Tim Dowling, Saturday columnistToo much TupperwareEveryone has way too many plastic storage containers, and half don’t have a lid, are stained or bubbled. Scale it back. Unfortunately, Tupperware isn’t accepted by local household recycling services but you can tryTerraCycle, donate to charity or repurpose, such as into tubs for planting seeds.If you still have quite a few, use a CD rack for the lids.Abi Macdonald,professional organiser, NorwichGlasseshalf-full or emptyI get annoyed with half-full glasses of water around the house, especially as we’re on a meter. I make myself feel better by pouring them into a little watering can, for when I need to do the plants. Also, keep a bottle of water in the fridge so you don’t have to run the mixer tap to get cold water after using hot.Hilary Osborne, Guardian money & consumer editorWobbly tablesI find it annoying when tables wobble. Despite all of our modern technology, we have not fixed this. My solution is to carry with me a small wooden wedge.Chris Haji-Michael, AustriaManky clothsI hate wiping up crumbs with a damp cloth – that is gross. So I have a small dustpan and brush used only for the kitchen side and tables. I can’t live without it. I even run it through the dishwasher to freshen it up.Victoria Cozens, EssexPreserving paintbrushesTo get the paint out of the paintbrush ferrule (where the bristles are fixed, and buildup ruins the brush), I use a cat comb. Brushes last longer and stay flexible.Diana Howard, Aix-en-Provence, FranceThe wonder tapeI have recently discovered the novelty of double-sided nano tape. It has lots of uses, including tacking random things to the wall, from pictures and shower gel to a bread knife or small scissors. It can stop mats slipping. It could hold things down on boats, perhaps. I like thinking of ways to use it next.Lindsey Wilson, NorwichSticky label marksStubborn stickers? Warm with a hairdryer for a few seconds to soften the glue, then peel off smoothly.Mimi Glenn, WarwickshireLazy curtainsIf you have those corded curtain tracks, you’ll find they become sluggish over time – because you haven’t lubricated them since they were installed. Never use WD-40. Just take an old clean rag, liberally saturate with cheap furniture polish, then wipe the track with it, leave to dry – and you’ll find they glide.Charlie Holding,LondonKids’tat gone wildKids attract endlessly annoying knick-knacks, so I’ve bought two clear over-door hangers for my daughter, which are meant for shoes, and put them inside her wardrobe door so they don’t make her room look messy. Also good is to have a box for each person in the house, kept in their bedroom, and when they leave random bits lying around, put them in there.Abi MRecycling runneth overIt is possible to fold most empty soft plastic packaging into a triangle shape with little effort. This saves space and prevents any remnants leaking out. I do it all the time – if I’m out, it means I can take my rubbish home without making a mess in my bag/pockets.Ollie Williams, BerlinFood and drinkYou v onionsPutting a teaspoon in your mouth seems to help with onion tears. But best of all is wearing contact lenses – not possible for everyone but a bonus if you use them.Georgina Hayden, Feast columnistHalf-edible asparagusI used to get frustrated with asparagus – one end takes longer to cook than the other. Perfectly cooked tips result in raw stalks; tender stalks yield mushy tips. The solution was both lazy and stupidly obvious: I leave on the rubber band the spears come bundled with, so they can stand upright, shoulder deep, in the simmering water for a few minutes; long enough to cook the stalks. Then I reach in with scissors and snip the band, so they fall over and the tips cook. If your asparagus doesn’t come with a rubber band – or if you want to avoid microplastics–tie with butcher’s string to get the same result. After I invented this, it occurred to me that maybe everyone already does this – maybe that’s what the rubber band isfor. Still, it’s changed my life for the better.TDMango messStand it upright and cut into two cheeks, using the stone as a guide. Then do the hedgehog trick, scoring the flesh in a crisscross section. When you flip it inside out, there are chunks of mango to cut off.GHUnopenable jarsSome people say pierce the lid with a knife but I think that is a recipe for disaster. If you tap the edge of the lid on a hard worktop to release the air pressure, it opens straight away.GHNo ice cube tray, no problemFreezing fruit is a way of keeping drinks super cold in the summer and looks pretty. Just put grapes in the freezer, on a baking sheet. When they have frozen, put them in a tub so you don’t waste so much space. Or, as a friend’s mum used to, freeze slices of lemon and lime for gin and tonics.GHGarlicky fingersI love garlic but the smell on my hands after peeling and chopping it was a big put-off. A transformational life hack was discovering rubbing and washing your hands with stainless steel after cutting garlic almost completely removes the smell. You can even buy a bar of stainless steel that looks like soap and does the trick.Tenzing Sonam, IndiaLeftoverbits and piecesI have a sandwich bag in my fridge of all the odds and ends of cheese; they keep for ages. I would always freeze feta, though, as it doesn’t last long. Likewise, keep any last little bits of carrot, onion or other veg in a bag and next time you are making a ragu or soup, chuck them in. If you buy a pot of cream for a recipe and use only a small amount, freeze the rest in an ice cube tray. Do the same with wine.GHEggshelleverywhereI always crack eggs on a worktop or chopping board.Just a tap to break the shell will make sure it doesn’t go everywhere. If you do it on the edge of a bowl or pan, you push shards of eggshell into the egg. Likewise if you use a knife you are more likely to get tiny bits of shell in your food. If you do get shell in the egg and try to use your fingers to pick out any fragments, it is absolutely impossible. If you use the rest of the shell, you will get it every time.GHView image in fullscreenPhotograph; Ilka and Franz. Clothes:Reserved. Ring:Kurt Geiger. Bracelet:Anisa SojkaEggs that are hard to peelI’ve found that placing the eggs directly into already boiling water, then transferring them immediately to cold water once they are cooked makes peeling much easier. I presume the thermal shock facilitates the separation of egg from shell. I really cannot bear to see people starting the eggs in a pan of cold water.Nicolas Magand, StrasbourgWasted honeyI find it really frustrating when measuring honey for a recipe, because you will always end up leaving honey on the tablespoon, so it’s not an accurate measure. But if you brush the spoon with a little bit of oil first, the honey will glide straight off.GHThe faff of peeling gingerPeel root ginger with a teaspoon. It’s unbeatable for getting into all the nooks and crannies.AnonymousGardenLost toolsFor some reason, most of the tools available are designed in earthy colours, so the minute you drop your trowel on the ground it becomes impossible to find, especially if you wander away and come back. I have taken to putting a ring of neon tape round the handle, so it is immediately obvious where a tool is.Claire Ratinon, Saturday gardening columnistSquirrels obsessed with your bulbsThis is deeply annoying. You plant all these bulbs, they cost lots of money, and then the squirrels dig them out. Some people try the cayenne pepper trick – putting it all over the soil after you have planted bulbs – but it is arduous and not very kind to the squirrels. The main way to get rid of them is with chicken wire over the pots. But an easy hack is to get the clear plastic lid of a storage crate and whack it on top with heavy stones. Put that on your pots and squirrels can’t get into it but the sunshine can.Alice Vincent, Saturday gardening columnistVery muddy bootsThe mud these last few winters has been so infuriating that my partner has made a welly puller. It is a plank of wood with a triangle cut out of it that you can put your heel into, mounted on a smaller piece of wood at a 30 degree angle off the ground. You have to use it properly or it gets covered in mud and doesn’t save your socks from getting covered, too. Take your first boot off using the toe of the second boot, then use the welly puller to take off that one. If you are not particularly handy with wood and nails, put a trug with a few inches of water in it at the back door. Stand in it and swish the mud off.CRProductivityForgotten things on your to-do listI’m a big fan of the principle of “universal capture”, which is productivity geek speak for always having ready access to somewhere you can scribble something down when you think of it, in a way that you’ll then see it later, so as to take action on it if necessary. The unfortunately namedBraintosslets me email a note to myself with two clicks, rather than going through my email app, and as I know I’ll check my email, I’m sure to encounter the reminder. Whenever I travel, I carry a plastic pouch that closes with a zip, so I can throw receipts, random papers, bits of currency, etc in there. All of this is really just a way of respecting the fact that the human brain is far too limited to serve as a useful repository for endless task lists.Oliver Burkeman, author ofMeditations for MortalsInterruptionsOne idea I’ve found useful for dealing with irritating interruptions when you’re trying to concentrate is: be careful not to define more things than necessary as “interruptions”. If you’re the kind of person who tries to schedule your whole day very strictly, you’re pretty much asking to feel annoyed when reality collides with your rigid plan. If you have autonomy over your schedule, a better idea is to try to safeguard three or four hours at most for total focus – this is, it turns out, the maximum countless authors, scientists and artists have managed in an uninterrupted fashion anyway. If I’m working at home on a day when it’s not my turn for school pickup, and my son bursts in to tell me excitedly about something he’s done, it’s a shame if I feel annoyed by the intrusion rather than delighted by the serendipitous interaction, solely because I’ve defined that period as time for deep focus.OBA stranger at the doorI discovered this by accident, but unsolicited door-knockers are eager to conclude their business and go away if you open the door while holding some kind of large electric gardening implement. I just happened to be carrying a hedge trimmer when the bell rang, but a chainsaw would be even better. You could leave it on a hook by the door.TDView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Ilka & Franz.

Necklaces:Anisa SojkaandMissomaRandom keys in the kitchen drawerYou know that box of old keys you see every day and don’t have a clue what they’re for? Take time to go through them, trying them out in various places. Soon you will know they are of no use to you. Chuck the lot. I did that a few years ago and all was fine.AggieMPaperwork mountainsWe have a “deal with them once” rule. As soon as it comes through the letterbox, any junk gets put straight in the recycling, rather than put away or allowed to clutter up surfaces, because that means you end up dealing with it at least twice, picking it up and moving it around. Instead, open your mail when it comes in, get rid of the envelope straight away, then have a paperwork system, so you’ve got sections for action required, pending or needs putting away, and teach everyone to follow suit.AbiMFashion and beautyFoundationsmudgesYou have done your makeup; now you want to put on a pale top without getting a tidemark on the neck. Simple: turn it around, put it over your head back to front, then scooch it round the right way before you put your arms in the sleeves. A tiny bit of foundation at your nape is way less visible than under your face.Jess Cartner-Morley, Guardianfashion editorTangly washingTo avoid this, put cords in a tote bag, tie it and wash. For hoodie strings, tie them in a bow around the neck, then put the whole thing in the tote bag to wash.Morwenna Ferrier, Guardianfashion& lifestyle editorCrumpled clothes on arrivalEver made pinwheel pastries? That’s the trick here, but with clothes. Lay tops on top of each other, fold sleeves diagonally across, then – as carefully and tightly as if rolling pastry – roll together, from neck down, so you end up with a swiss roll of fabric. Do the same with trousers or dresses. Place in your case and fill the gaps with PJs, denim shorts, socks, things that don’t have crease issues. It takes longer than chucking everything in but works like a charm and saves space.JCMOdd socksI solved this by throwing out all my socks and buying only black ones. They end up not matching anyway because they fade at different rates, have different size bands at the top, etc, but it’s better than it could be.Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett, Guardian columnistView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Ilka & Franz. Socks:Happy Socks. Shoes:New Look. Skirt:ReservedShoes that rubThey felt fine in the changing room but now you’ve got a blister coming on? With leather shoes, you can fix this with a hairdryer. (Check they are leather: most “vegan leather” is plastic, which will melt.) Dampen the leather with a wet cloth, then point a hairdryer at the problem area until you feel the leather warm and soften. Put on thick socks and go for a walk.JCMPeople ‘borrowing’ your tightsIf more than one person in your house wears tights, they never end up in your possession. The only way round this is by enforcing rigid brand allegiance, so you know if they’re from M&S, they’re definitely yours.Zoe Williams, Guardian columnistMascara splodgesIf you splodge mascara on your face, don’t panic! Wait a minute or two for it to dry, then brush away using a clean spoolie or an eyebrow pencil’s brush. It will easily come off without disturbing your makeup.Jaz Crush, makeup artist, London100 ways to slightly improve your life without really tryingRead moreThat last tiny bit of nail polishCut old tights into small pieces and use to remove nail polish. The nylon’s slightly abrasive quality makes the polish come off faster than with a cotton ball.Francesca Fortunato, New YorkCrinkled clothingI never iron clothes. I just shake them really well when I take them out of the machine, hang out, then fold neatly. If an item needs ironing, I won’t buy it.AbiMTangled jewelleryIf you want to wear multiple necklaces but avoid tangling, you need amagnetic clasp– attach each necklace to its own connector andvoilà.Chloe Mac Donnell, Guardian deputy fashion& lifestyle editorStinky foam slippersFreeze them, wash on a gentle cycle, then air.Lee Setili, Georgia, USBobbleson tightsWrap parcel tape round your hand and go over the garment as you would with a lint roller.Aggie MFrizzyhairSleeping on a satin pillowcase stops you getting so hot: it repels sweat and keeps moisture in your hair. Also, a microfibre towel is gentler on your hair’s cuticles.Michelle Druy, hairdresser, SurreyHealthThe unavoidable running blistersSooner or later, if you are running you will get a big bastard blister on your heel, and there is no point using anything other than one of those expensive padded blister plasters. Normal plasters won’t get you home without pain, or let you run again next day.Phil Daoust, GuardianFit for evercolumnistHiccupsI have a guaranteed cure. 1 Take a deep breath and pinch your nose. 2 With nose pinched, try to expel air through it, to the point where your ears almost pop. 3 Maintaining the ears-about-to-pop sensation, sip and swallow cool water from a glass or cup. This technique has never let me down. I believe it works by forcing your brain to concentrate on other small motor actions, thereby forgetting about the hiccups.David Daniel, ShanghaiView image in fullscreenPhotography throughout: Ilka & Franz, assisted by Pablo Bueno.

This is what we do in our family and I swear it helps get rid of pain much faster. We don’t ask, “What happened?” or, “Are you OK?” until the injured person speaks first. A hand on their shoulder or a respectful bowing of the head to the Gods of Minor Pain is sufficient at this time.AnonymousTechnologyFace ID failsBring your iPhone to eye level and be sure your face is square on to the top of the screen, your eyes are open and the phone isn’t facing into direct sun. Still having problems? Try redoing your scan in the face ID settings, enable mask mode or set up an alternative appearance – helpful if you sometimes wear glasses.Samuel Gibbs, Guardian consumer technology editorPhone storage woesDeleting unused apps and games, storing photos and videos in the cloud, and clearing unwanted offline music and films can quickly free up space, but don’t overlook WhatsApp and other messaging apps.

Here’s the counterstrategySun 8 Jun 2025 07.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 8 Jun 2025 19.29 EDTShareDuring the first 100-plus days of his presidency,Donald Trumphas done his damnedest to remake the US in his image. Fearing Hurricane Donald, a host of universities, law firms, newspapers, public schools and Fortune 500 companies have rushed to do his bidding, bowing before he even comes calling. Other institutions cower, in hopes that they will go unnoticed.But this behavior, which social scientists call “anticipatory compliance”, smoothes the way to autocracy because it gives the Trump regime unlimited power without his having to lift a finger. Halting autocracy in its tracks demands a counter-strategy – let’s call it anticipatorynoncompliance.Examples of anticipatory compliance are legion.How to fight back against Trump? Look to poor people’s movements | Rev Dr Liz Theoharis and Noam Sandweiss-BackRead moreGoodbye, academic freedom:Trump means to impose his anti-intellectual ideology on higher education. He is using unproven allegations of antisemitism and claims of discriminatory diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programs as an excuse to punish top-ranked private universities – initially hapless Columbia, then other schools including Harvard, Princeton, Cornell and Northwestern – by withholding billions of dollars in federal grants. My own university, the University of California, Berkeley, anticipates that it will be added to this list when Trump turns his attention to nationally renowned public universities.“Be afraid” is the message for every university – threats to withhold funds from schools that use “woke” language have prompted some that aren’t even under the gun to censor themselves,excising wordslike “race”, “gender”, “class” and “equity” from course titles and curriculums.Anticipatory compliance also affects the actions of public schools. Worried that, because of their alleged “wokeness”, they will lose the federal dollars that deliver extra help to those who need it most, school systems have altered their curriculum to whitewash the historical record and restrict the literature available to students. Adieu, Toni Morrison and Rosa Parks.Goodbye, free press:Disney and Metashelled outacombined $40mto settle baseless libel lawsuits brought by Trump, and Paramount is negotiating to make Trump’s spurious 60 Minutes lawsuit disappear.On the eve of the 2024 election, Jeff Bezos, Amazon’s founder and the owner of the Washington Post, pulled an editorial endorsing Kamala Harris, to stay in Trump’s good graces. So did the Los Angeles Times, whose owner is a billionaire businessman.Goodbye, legal representation:Nine leading law firmssuccumbed to blackmail to get rid of the president’s executive orders that punished a few firms for displeasing him. Collectively, they agreed to provide more than $1bn worth of pro bono legal work to causes of Trump’s choosing. Now they’re being asked to defend the coal industry and tariffs, which surely isn’t what they expected.To curry favor and avoid ridicule in a Trump tweet, dozens of major companies are treating the president as if he were kingWhat’s more, some top-drawer firms have stopped providing pro bono work on immigration lawsuits and other hot topic issues. Instead, they are putting their talent at Trump’s disposal, neutering themselves while the White House makes mincemeat of the rule of law.Hello, toadying:To curry favor and avoid ridicule in a Trump tweet, dozens of major companies, ranging fromAmazon to Pepsi, are treating the president as if he were king, reducing or abandoning their DEI programs without being specifically threatened.Those who bend the knee rationalize their actions as simply a prudent survival strategy. But that’s delusory, for the historical record shows that anticipatory compliance paves the road to autocracy. Bullies like Trump always demand more from their supplicants – more money, more abandoning principles, more loyalty-oath behavior. Anticipatory compliance feeds the beast, showing authoritarians how much they can get away with.Here’s the good news – anticipatory noncompliance is on the rise. Challenges to Trump’s unconstitutional actions have emerged in higher and K-12 education, the legal profession and the corporate world. The citizenry is now making its voice heard.Spearheaded by Harvard’s defiant pose, a growing number of colleges and universities are pushing back against Trump’s outrageous demands.A recent statementfrom hundreds of college administrators declared that “we speak with one voice against the unprecedented government overreach and political interference now endangering American higher education”. Faculty senates in the Big 10 Academic Alliance crafted a “mutual defense compact”; behind the scenes, the presidents of about10 elite private universitiesare deciding what red lines they won’t cross.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFighting BackFree newsletterBig thinkers on what we can do to protect civil liberties and fundamental freedoms in a Trump presidency.

Diversity is a popular goal that many investors and consumers take into account in their decisions. When Target rolled back DEI, the company had to confront a consumer boycott and a 17% stock drop.

It will take a years-long fight that deploys an arsenal of tactics, ranging from mass demonstrations and consumer boycotts to litigation and political organizing. It’s grueling work, but if autocracy is to be defeated there’s no option. “Not everything that is faced can be changed; but nothing can be changed until it is faced,” observed James Baldwin, in a 1962 New York Times article. A half-century later, that message still rings true.What’s giving me hope nowCourts have stood firm in their defense of the rule of law, pushing back against Trump’s power-grab executive orders.

She was the funny one, the party starter, the friend who never said no to another round of drinks. To friends and colleagues, she seemed effortlessly confident.But beneath the banter and bravado was a deep discomfort – with silence, with vulnerability, and most of all, with herself.“I didn’t even realise I was numbing anything,” she told me in one of our recent therapy sessions. “I just thought I liked to have fun. But looking back, I was terrified of feeling anything real.”Jamie, now 39, is part of a growing number of Australians rethinking their relationship with alcohol. For her, drinking wasn’t just a habit, it was a coping mechanism – although she was the last one to realise this. She was drinking to blur the edges.Narcissism can’t always be fixed – but you can heal after being hurt by it | Bianca DennyRead moreThere wasn’t a traumatic event that she could remember, but because feeling sad or lonely or anxious felt unbearable, alcohol helped her skip past that. It worked – until it didn’t.Her “bottom” wasn’t dramatic; she told me in one session it was more like a slow hollowing, and she got tired of waking up feeling like a stranger to herself.The turning point came in the early months of the pandemic. Isolated from friends, stripped of distractions, she began to realise how often she reached for wine to fill the space. “One night I was sitting alone with a glass of pinot, and I remember thinking – what would happen if I didn’t drink this?”That question changed everything.Jamie decided to stop drinking “just for a month”. But when the fog began to lift, she couldn’t go back. She describes early sobriety as raw and revealing. She was suddenly face to face with everything she pushed away for years – grief, anxiety, even joy – and it became overwhelming.Alcohol addiction and emotional numbingAlcohol addiction is often less about the substance itself and more about what it helps a person avoid.From a clinical standpoint, we understand alcohol not just as a chemical dependency, but as an emotional anaesthetic – one that temporarily blunts the nervous system’s distress signals. Many individuals who struggle with problematic drinking patterns may have started out chasing pleasure and to be social; but consistent reliance upon alcohol can result in using it to flee pain such as unprocessed grief, chronic stress, shame, anxiety or trauma.Claire felt overwhelmed by life’s uncertainties. A self-imposed pause helped her find solid ground | Sara MussaRead moreThe neurobiology of addiction reveals that alcohol activates the brain’s reward system while simultaneously suppressing the prefrontal cortex, impairing emotional regulation and decision-making. In this way, alcohol becomes a fast, accessible tool for short-term relief – even if it compounds emotional dysregulation in the long term.What makes this cycle so complex is that emotional numbing isn’t always conscious. Clients often present in therapy describing “overwhelm”, “flatness” or “disconnection”, without immediately recognising that these are signs of emotional avoidance – and that alcohol has become part of that equation. Therapy helps illuminate the underlying patterns: how early attachment dynamics, adverse childhood experiences or unresolved trauma may have shaped a person’s tolerance for emotional discomfort.A trauma-informed approach encourages clients to build somatic awareness, develop emotional literacy and begin tolerating – rather than bypassing – their internal experience. Recovery, then, is not only about abstaining from alcohol; it’s about being able to stay present with what’s real and building a nervous system that can feel without needing to flee.How to overcome emotional numbingIn group therapy with professional guidance, Jamie started to see how she had numbed her emotions and buried the difficulties she had experienced in her life. “I sat with just me,” she recalled. “And I started crying and couldn’t stop. It felt like every emotion I’d stored was finally being released.”I encouraged Jamie to begin journalling daily and start each entry with the question: “What am I feeling today?” Sometimes she said it was anger. Sometimes relief. Sometimes nothing at all. Jamie finally allowed herself to feel – not with fear, but with curiosity. Our emotions can serve as signposts, gently pointing us towards the places where healing is needed: our blockages, our numbness and the parts of us that have gone quiet in the face of hopelessness.Trauma can leave us emotionally numb – each step towards reconnection is a win | Diane YoungRead moreRecovery – from drinking, from disconnection, from self-avoidance – isn’t linear, and Jamie is still in that process. But what’s changed is her willingness to stay with herself, especially when things feel hard.Jamie is one of many emerging in what some call the “sober curious” movement. But for her, it’s not about labels or lifestyle – it’s about presence. She’s not interested in moralising alcohol use. It’s not about judging drinking. It’s about asking why.Whyam I drinking?Whatam I avoiding? Can I support myself with awareness? And what might be possible if I stopped?In a culture where numbing is easy – scroll, sip, swipe – choosing to feel can feel too hard. It’s important to take at least one quiet moment a day to ask yourself:What am I feeling?You might be surprised by the answer.* All clients discussed are fictional amalgamsDiane Young is a trauma specialist and psychotherapist atSouth Pacific Private, a trauma, addiction and mental health treatment centreIn Australia, support is available atBeyond Blueon 1300 22 4636,Lifelineon 13 11 14, and atMensLineon 1300 789 978.

For Labour, the stakes couldn’t be higherSun 8 Jun 2025 07.36 EDTLast modified on Sun 8 Jun 2025 13.55 EDTShareIhave got used to a scene that has been repeated in wildly different places all over the UK. Close to the centre of a town or city, there will be a construction project, centred on the delivery of brand new apartments. The air will be filled with the loud clanking of machinery; a hastily finished show flat might offer a glimpse of what is to come.I have developed an unexpected addiction to these places, always photographing the hoardings that hide building work from passersby, which usually feature ecstatic thirtysomethings drinking coffee and relaxing in upmarket domestic environments (they are usually accompanied by slogans like “live, work, relax, dream”). And I have come to expect a kind of encounter that goes straight to the heart of one of our biggest national problems. Up will walk a member of the public, looking sceptically at what is under way. Their words may vary but the basic message is always the same: “Who’s this for? Not me.”Atthe last count, 1.3m households in England were on local authority housing waiting lists, the highest figure since 2014. About164,000 childrenlive in temporary accommodation. Average rent increases in the private sector recentlyhit a record highof 9.2%.Figures just releasedby the Home Builders Federation show that the number of new homes given planning consent in England in the first quarter of 2025 was the lowest since 2012, something partly blamed on the absence of any government support scheme for first-time buyers. The market for homes people can buy remains a byword for exclusion and impossibility, which is why those new apartment blocks are always such a dependable symbol of fury and frustration.The same anger has long since seeped into our politics. Fifteen years ago, I can vividly recallreporting from the London borough of Barking and Dagenhamabout chronic housing problems caused by themass sell-off of council houses, and the area’s increasingly toxic politics. A 60-year-old owner of a bakery told me about her daughter, who lived with her four-year-old son in a privately rented flat full of pigeon droppings that had apparently made him chronically ill. They were on the council waiting list. “But every time,” she told me, “she’s, like, number 200 or 300.”She and her husband, she said, were going to vote for the neo-fascist British National party. At the time, it felt as if what I was seeing still sat at the outer edge of politics. But these days, the same essential story has taken up residence at the heart of the national conversation: the BNP has been chased into irrelevance and protest votes now go en masse toReform UK, and the connection between the housing crisis and the febrile state of the political mainstream is obvious. Certainly, it’s impossible to grasp the salience of immigration without appreciating many people’s visceral feelings about the scarcity of homes.In the inner circles of Keir Starmer’s government, there must be voices keenly aware of the need to finally tackle all this. Some of the right instincts were evident in Labour’s promise to oversee the building of1.5m new homesin England by the end of this parliament. The chancellor has recently reiterated the aim of delivering the“biggest boostin social and affordable housing in a generation”. But what that means and whether any such thing is on its way are still clouded in doubt.The clock is loudly ticking down to this week’s spending review. Last weekend, the Greater Manchester mayor, Andy Burnham, addressed an event put on by the progressive pressure group Compass, and said Rachel Reeves should “unlock public landfor mayors to use to build a new generation of council homes at pace – akin to the drive of the postwar Labour government”.Housing associations have pleadedwith the chancellor to reclassify social homes as critical infrastructure (a category that covers such essentials as food, energy and “data”), which would allow increased funding to fall within her fiscal rules.Meanwhile, Angela Rayner – the minister in charge of housing, who is said to be fiercely attached to the dream of a social housing renaissance – is seemingly locked in intense last-minute negotiations with the Treasury.Although the budget unveiled in March contained an extra £2bn for the government’s affordable homes programme in 2026-27,its own publicity material saidthis was merely “a down payment [sic] … ahead of more long-term investment in social and affordable housing planned this year”.Rayner is reportedly pushing the plain factthat the ever-more doubtful 1.5m target will be missed without much higher funding. We will see what happens on Wednesday, but housing seems to have fallen out of the government’s messaging. Of late, it has seemed that Reeves and Starmer think investments in defence and public transport are a much higher priority than dependable shelter.There is a vital point at the core of this issue. Even if Starmer has often given the impression that the answer to the housing crisis lies in clearing away planning law and letting corporate developers do the work, their ring-road faux-Georgian cul-de-sacs will not provide anything like the entirety of the solution. Social housing – which, at the scale required, needs to be largely the responsibility of councils – is not just what millions of British people need as a matter of urgency; it will also have to be hugely revived if the government is to meet its aims: 1.5m homes in a single parliament equates to 300,000 a year. The last time such a feat materialised wasin 1977, when about half of all new-builds were delivered by local authorities.A new version of that story will not be easy to realise. Threadbare councils are in no state to play the role in a housing revival that they need to. The UK is also faced with a dire construction skills crisis: despite the government’s plans to train 60,000 new construction workers,industry insiders are adamantthat we will only build what’s required with the help of building workers from abroad. But failure should not be an option: it will not just deepen this country’s social decay, but also boost malign forces on the hard right, and present a huge obstacle to Labour having any chance of winning the next election.In the midst of last year’s contest,I went to Aldershot, the old garrison town at the centre of a constituency that Labour won from the Tories on a swing of 17 points. Grand buildings once used by generals and majors were full of luxury flats, and the town centre was scattered with empty shops. There, I came across a new development calledUnion Yard, which was on its way to completion. It contained 128 student “units”, 82 properties for private rent, and a mere 18 classified as “affordable” (which, in keeping with one of the grimmest aspects of the politics of housing, means they will be let for no more than 80% of local market rent), set aside for people over the age of 55.Not long before, the waiting list for council homes in the surrounding county of Hampshirehad hit 30,000. On a Tuesday afternoon, I sat facing the images of the high life that adorned the development’s outer edges, and had a long conversation with a twentysomething woman who was full of a striking mixture of sadness and anger. I knew what she was going to say, and it came out pretty much verbatim: “Who’s that for? Not me.”John Harris is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsHousingOpinionSocial housingInequalityCommunitiesLabourReform UKEnglandcommentShareReuse this content"

Perhaps we should try sharing our planetSun 8 Jun 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 8 Jun 2025 12.46 EDTShareAt this year’s Cannes film festival, some unexpected hires joined the security detail at luxury hotel the Majestic. They were clad not in kevlar but in deep chestnut plumage, with wingspans up to four feet, talons for toes and meat-ripping ebony beaks. The new recruits were Harris hawks and their mission was clear: guard stars from the aerial menace of gulls daring to photobomb or snatch vol-au-vents.This might sound like an extreme solution to a benign problem – after all, haven’t most of us lost sandwiches to swooping beaks and come out relatively unscathed? But as these notorious food pirates come ashore in growing numbers, cities around the world are increasingly grappling with how to manage them. Hiring hawks from local falconer Christophe Puzin was the Majestic’s answer to curbing gull-related incidents (such as Sophie Marceau’s 2011 wine-on-dress situation). But in metropolises such as New York, Rome, Amsterdam and London gulls are widely considered a menace, too, as they take up permanent residence on urban stoops.Gulls seem to be louder than ever, which makes it easy to forget their status as seabirds in crisis. All of the more than50 global species of gullare falling victim to fragmenting habitats under conflicting marine policy measures, devastating avian flu, and evenbrain damageand organ failure resulting from plastic ingestion. In the UK, this torrent of trouble has renderedmany species of gull in decline.Predator-free rooftops have enticed them from the waves since the 1940s and, broadly speaking, gulls have adapted well to their changing environment – even becoming effective urbanseed dispersers. Lamp-posts have replaced cliff ledges, buildings are islands, landfill is rocky shore. One study found thatgulls can recognise human routines, with their presence around schools tripling during mealtimes. Their adaptation – however bothersome it might be for us – has driven their survival. Perhaps acknowledging this could help us to live alongside them.As we have no licence to either capture or kill these birds, introducing hawks as agents of natural gull control is one method of regulating human/gull interaction. Some councils have produced gull awareness campaigns, encouraging locals to report nesting and not to feed them. Others default to installing physical barriers, such as spokes and spikes, to discourage gulls’ resting sites. Such measures are expensive for local authorities and their effectiveness is inconclusive. Some councils, such as Carlisle, opt for a more covert approach, threatening gulls more gently in the form ofhawk-like kites. In Exeter, Deliveroo trialled “repellent” audio tracks, broadcasting recorded falcon cries and gull distress calls to deter them. Researchers at the University of Exeter have also investigated thebenefit of holding eye contactwith a gull, in making them think twice about stealing food.But such an array of anti-gull options perpetuates the patronising narrative of these animals as pests. The fact that gulls are thriving in cities points to our own ecological failures as a society. Global household waste is growing rapidly, most of which is thrown into landfill, where it is left to rot, releasing large amounts ofmethane– a greenhouse gas80 timesmore harmful than carbon dioxide for 20 years after its release. We aren’t so much giving gulls an ocean eviction notice as we are begging for them to come inland, feeding their instinct to dive, rip and smash around us – one bin day at a time.View image in fullscreenA gull weighs up its lunch options in St Ives, Cornwall.Photograph: Matt Cardy/Getty ImagesSo what are urban gulls, if not a menace? Perhaps, in Cannes, they’re a message of timing. The film festival takes place in May, duringgull breeding season(April to July). It is a period when gulls are loud and chaotic, their defensiveness spiking when hatching and fledging; andwhen food is visible, we’re baiting them with easy pickings. With broods to protect, reflexes are heightened.It is easy to conflate gulls’ seasonal survival with year-round behaviour. On wilder shores, these periods of increased activity would unfold unnoticed. But we have altered ecological niches to make cities too tempting, deforming the instincts of species trying to adapt with acts of imagination and resilience.As a long-living social species that has mastered feats of adaptation, gulls have much to teach us. And as they adapt to urban habitats, we must also learn to live alongside them. This offers us a chance to change the story, to shape the future of shared urban spaces. Spaces where festival organisers align with nature’s calendar, and the rhythms of life are respected. Spaces where waste is not just managed, but reimagined. Spaces where human impact is studied with intent, not ignorance. Spaces that would allow our relationship with the wild to mature so profoundly, conflict would become obsolete.Sophie Pavelle is a writer and science communicatorExplore more on these topicsBirdsOpinionAnimal behaviourAnimalsWildlifecommentShareReuse this content"

But I have been to a youth hostel with four babies, which is sort of the same thing. Everywhere we turned there was singing, selfies, strangers coming up to us in the street and women getting their boobs out – it wasthe Small Faces, but with actual small faces.My God, how I love youth hostels. In all their strange, intergenerational, shared washing-up sponges and boot-room glory, they are the best of us. You can keep your sponsored hotel stays and luxury apartments as far as I’m concerned. Give me a fluorescent-lit kitchen with five electric hobs and a roll of stickers to label your milk any day.Sharing a single room designed for eight people with three breastfeeding mothers and four – count them –fourdribbling infants meant that our entire stay cost everyone just £40 a night, and I got to fall asleep to the soundtrack of polyphonic suckling. I had a sea view, a mattress on the floor; there was an en suite shower and a sink in which to wash out approximately 6kg of sand from my daughter’s bum cheeks.But aside from the bunk beds and drying rooms and the donated surplus food left in the kitchen, what I really love about youth hostels is their pure, socially democratic, unlikely mishmash of guests. Where else do you find groups of teenagers feasting on bangers and mash sitting opposite a white-haired military veteran in a sports jacket and racing-green tie? Where else do you get to share your holiday with a family from the Philippines cooking pasta and sardines right beside a white guy in his 20s microwaving a sweet potato and doing calisthenics? Where else will you find a grand, wood-panelled living room in which an elderly couple in pale blue linen are FaceTiming their children as your friend Miranda changes a nappy on a coffee table?The history of youth hostels in this country is far more radical than the board games and fried eggs might suggest. After the first world war and the economic uncertainty of the 1930s, the Youth Hostel Association (YHA) bought up a large number of stately houses and country estates that had previously been the playgrounds of wealthy aristocrats. In doing so, the YHA was able to – as it put it on its website – “give young working people an unprecedented opportunity tospend leisure time in fresh airand open countryside, on a scale only previously possible for the wealthy”. Suddenly working-class families, children from choked and dirty cities, pensioners, faith groups, students, and even four sleep-deprived women in snap-open bras and their babies were able to enjoy the benefits of nature, fresh air and grand architecture.The four of us swam in the nearby sea and, as some of the country’s most landlocked women, even rejoiced in dipping our inland infants’ toes in the water (pray for the Dorset sewage level). We ate chips on the pier, dodged gulls and woke in the morning to the sight of cliffs rather than our usual curtains.Youth hostels are a muddy, joyful miracle. Losing them to Brexit and the cost of living would be a tragedy | John HarrisRead moreWhat’s more, the size of those private rooms, with their bunk beds and plentiful bathrooms, means you can avoid that great collective washout: the family holiday. I love my husband and my blood relatives, but I had such a fun time being able to go away with three other women in the same circumstances and life stage as me; to happily share the logistics and labour of childcare and cooking; to have other people around when I wanted to shower or sneak out to the shop; to enjoy constant company without the very familiarity that leads to most family mealtimes being an extended conversation about either Minecraft or the price of buses. We chatted to other guests about their own first forays into youth hostelling with small children, and I was politely asked to budge my prostrate daughter across the floor a little so others could access the freezer.As Britain’s busiest holiday time approaches and my Instagram feed fills up with media millennials touting their sponsored stays in three-figure hotels and live reels in ball and claw baths, you’ll instead find me stomping through fields to a former mansion.Nell Frizzell is a journalist and authorExplore more on these topicsHostelsOpinionChildrenFamilycommentShareReuse this content"

Don’t believe the PR hype: these weapons are immoral, irrational and catastrophicSun 8 Jun 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 8 Jun 2025 06.19 EDTSharePlans by Keir Starmer’s government to modernise and potentially expand Britain’s nuclear weapons arsenal, unveiled in the 2025strategic defence review (SDR), seriously undermine international non-proliferation efforts. They will fuel a global nuclear arms race led by the US, China and Russia. And they increase the chances that lower-yield, so-called tactical nukes will be deployed and detonated in conflict zones.This dangerous path leads in one direction only: towards thenormalisation of nuclear warfare.These unconscionable proposals are a far cry from the days when Robin Cook, Labour’s foreign secretary from 1997 to 2001,championed unilateral nuclear disarmamentand helped scrap the UK’s airdropped gravity bombs. They are a continuation of a redundant, inhuman, immoral, potentially international law-breaking deterrence policy thatcash-strapped Britain can ill afford, will struggle to implement at cost and on time, and which perpetuates illusions about its global power status.Starmer’s justification for spending an additional £15bn on nuclear warheads for four as yet un-built Dreadnought-class submarines, whose price tag is £41bn and rising, is that the world – and the threat – has changed. But in terms of nuclear arms, it really hasn’t. Even as cold war tensions receded, the eight other known nuclear-weapons states – the US, Russia, China, France, India, Pakistan, North Korea and Israel – clung on to their arsenals. Some expanded them.Today, as the global security environment deteriorates again, governments that ignored an obligation to pursue nuclear disarmament “in good faith” under article six of the 1970non-proliferation treaty(NPT) are finding new reasons to keep on doing so. Britain must not compound its decades-long failure to honour the spirit of the treaty. The SDR’s assertion that“continued UK leadership within the NPT is imperative”seems disingenuous, given government intentions.The SDR concedes the NPT, up for review next year, is close to failing. “Historical structures for maintaining strategic stability and reducing nuclear risks have not kept pace with the evolving security picture,” it says. “With New Start [the 2010 US-Russia strategic arms reduction treaty] set to expire in February 2026, thefuture of strategic arms control– at least in the medium term – does not look promising.”This is a Trident missile-sized understatement. Nuclear proliferation is once again a huge problem. The US will spend an estimated $2tn over 30 years on weapons development.Donald Trump said in Februaryhe wants to “denuclearise”. Guess what! He’s doing the opposite. The White House is seeking toraise the National Nuclear Security Administration’s annual weapons budgetby 29%, to $25bn, while slashing funding for the arts, sciences and foreign aid. That’s on top of several multibillion-dollar Pentagon weapons programmes.China’s nuclear strike force hasmore than doubled in size since 2020, with some pointed at Taiwan. Russia’s expanding capabilities include anuclear-capable hypersonic missile, recentlyfired into Ukraine. And Trump’sGolden Dome planupends prior undertakings on anti-missile defence. By joining the proliferators, hypocritical Britain sends acynical signal to Iran, Saudi Arabia and others whose supposed nuclear ambitions it opposes.One future scenario is especially chilling: the possible reintroduction by Britain of air-launched nuclear weapons for the first time since Cook scrapped them. This could involve buying US F-35A fighters and arming them withUS-designed B61-12 bombs. These bombs have variable yields and could be used tactically, against a battlefield target, a command HQ or a city. They could be launched remotely, using unmanned drones. They bring the prospect of nuclear warfare measurably closer.Starmer is leaning heavily on the review’s claim that Russian “nuclear coercion” is the biggest menace facing the UK. Even if true, no amount of nuclear missiles and bombs may suffice if political will is lacking to directly confront Vladimir Putin by, for example, deploying Nato conventional forces to defend Ukraine and responding forcefully to hybrid attacks on Britain. Like the former US president Joe Biden, Starmer gives too much credence toMoscow’s crude threats. Putin knows that if he presses the nuclear button, it will explode in his face. He’s many things – but not suicidal.This is the conundrum at the heart of nuclear deterrence theory. Nuking a nuclear-armed adversary guarantees self-destruction (which is whyIndia and Pakistan jibbed at all-out warlast month). And hurling nuclear threats at states and foes that lack nuclear weapons is ineffective. As Ukraine shows, they grow more defiant. As a weapon, nuclear blackmail is overrated. Fear of British nukes did not deter Argentina’s 1982 Falklands invasion. Nukes did not stop al-Qaida in 2001 or Hamas in 2023. So why have nukes at all?Retaining nuclear weapons at current or increased levelsdoes not make Britain safer. Their use would be immoral, irrational and catastrophic. They are grossly expensive, consuming resources that the UK, facing painful Treasury cuts again this week, could more sensibly use to build hospitals and schools and properly equip its armed forces.It’suncertain how independentof the US the British deterrent really is in practice. Does Starmer or Trump have the final word on use?Official secrecy prevents adequate democratic scrutiny. And the idea that nuclear warfare, once the taboo is broken, might somehow be contained or limited is a fast-track ticket to oblivion. Gradual disarmament, not rearmament, is the only way to escape this nightmare.The SDR urges a government PR campaign to convince the British people of the “necessity” of a nuclear arsenal. No thanks. As Russia againraises nuclear war fears, what’s needed is public education about the dangers of weapons proliferation. People worry about everything from an existential global climate emergency to the cost of living. But what we’re discussing here is the universal cost of dying.Nuclear warfare is the most immediate threat to life on earth. Worry about that first. It’s a shortcut to apocalypse – now.Simon Tisdall is a Guardian foreign affairs commentatorExplore more on these topicsNuclear weaponsOpinionDefence policyTridentMilitarycommentShareReuse this content"

She had been wanting to do it for ages. “Just feels nice to get rid of this hair you’ve had on your head for a long time,” she says, cutting into a mushroom pie outside a south London pub in early May. “Feels quite restorative. Feels functional, which I like.”Her blue sweater vest exposes her bare arms, the left tattooed with a tiny “T” wearing a crown, to the stealthy midday heat. A woman shaving her head can carry a lot of cultural baggage, but can also get rid of it. Typically pragmatic, ever in her own lane, the Welsh musician and producer hasn’t really noticed a reaction either way. “I’ve really just been in the bubble of friends and family for the past year, not really been out and about too much, which has been really nice.”Born in Carmarthenshire, Le Bon, 42, has been living back in Cardiff after spending much of the past decade in California. Her desolately beautiful seventh solo album, Michelangelo Dying, was supposed to come out last year. Instead, exhaustion and persistent illness after the dissolution of a long relationship, and her desert dream with it, meant everything had to stop.Le Bon can appear regal live, manipulating her guitar with Tilda Swinton-level poise, but in person she’s softly spoken, gentle and succinct. She would rather avoid specifics about the end of the relationship: “It’s not really about him,” she says, of Michelangelo Dying. Instead, the album is about grieving a fantasy and “realising you’ve completely abandoned yourself in the throes of this all-encompassing love. The breakup was always like an amputation that you don’t really want, but you know will save you.” Her lyrics outline a world falling apart and not being able to do anything about it, even being told the world is different from reality as trust wastes away to nothing: “You smoke our love like you’ve never known violence,” she sings with crushed condemnation on Heaven Is No Feeling.In an unparalleled catalogue of uncanny, soft-worn post-punk that’s entirely Le Bon’s own – one that started in 2008 and hit its stride with 2016’s absurdistCrab Day– the album is another cut above: emotionally direct in a new way for her, but submerged in a crystalline murk, like light refracted through shadowy water (the artwork depicts her drowning). She recorded it between Los Angeles, Cardiff, Hydra and, finally, the Joshua Tree desert that had been her home and creative wellspring, to give the album its spiritual conclusion. “There’s something about that space where I feel I’m all ages at once,” she says. “I feel it when I’m in the sea, when I’m in love, when I’m with people who ignite me.”Guitar refrains repeat throughout the record as she puzzles out the “impenetrable. That’s how I felt – like I tried everything.” Her melodies give these songs their shape: “She’s got this vocal phrasing that’s awkward in the best way,” says collaborator John Cale, who appears on the song Ride. “The voice is beautiful but her delivery is what opens her up to everything.”View image in fullscreenA room of her own … Cate Le Bon.Photograph: H HawklineAt home in Cardiff the post-punk iconoclast is just Cate Timothy (Le Bon was a joke from an early gig poster that stuck). She starts her day by making coffee and listening to drone music: “almost like medication” – Ellen Arkbro, Kali Malone, Éliane Radigue, the latter recommended by Bradford Cox of Deerhunter, whose last record Le Bon produced. “It creates this porous landscape that reacts to however you’re feeling in the moment,” she says. She’s also been making drone music with friends “for nothing other than the joy of it, the healing nature of it, and having time to do stuff like that that isn’tforsomething.”That forest fire of romantic love makes you abandon a lot of thingsHer best friend since the age of 11 lives close, as does her younger sister with her new baby, as well as her cousin and her parents. Le Bon gardens, cooksand walks her new rescue dog, the scruffy terrier Mila, who has springy eyebrows and a great sense of humour. “There was always this proverbial dog I was going to get at some point, which I suppose represented a lot of things,” she says. “I saw her on the West Wales Poundies [Dog Rescue] site and went: Oh, I think that’s my dog.” She can’t show me a picture of Mila fast enough: she looks like aShirley Hughesillustration. “I think making space for her in my life, and prioritising her, as ridiculous as that sounds, has been really wonderful.”Caring for Mila and having a routine that lasted more than a few months between tours reminded Le Bon to care for herself. She had been trying to outrun heartbreak, busying herself producing for other artists: Devendra Banhart, Wilco, Horsegirl; she’s in Peckham this week with Dry Cleaning before they record their third album in France.Even though she only works with acts she feels a connection with, she says, “I was very willing to go anywhere, any time, to work on stuff I loved. I didn’t really have a home. I became very exhausted from it.” She had been experiencing full-body hives, debilitating back issues and strange anxiety. Her symptoms eventually made her realise she had felt “a reluctance to see things as they are”, she says in her calm, considered way, “because you think love is enough, and I think that’s the most heartbreaking thing, when you realise that love isn’t enough.”Originally, Le Bon set out to make a very different kind of record: a spikier, sharper follow-up to the warped beauty of 2022’sPompeii. The breakup was “a very messy end, a decision that was made and not made at the same time”, she says. “It was discombobulating. I kept thinking I would come back to myself by making a record, but I was trying to make a record that had nothing to do with it.” Eventually, she had no choice but to get over her resistance to writing about love. “There’s a softness that comes from the surrender,” she says of the album’s almost dubby, decaying sound. “A fluidity, a kind of honesty in throwing yourself into something because you know you have to, instead of bracing yourself against it.”Cate Le Bon: Heaven Is No Feeling – videoShe describes the album as “photographing a wound but picking at it at the same time”. The contradiction of heartbreak is the desire to escape it while also refusing to let it go: “Heartache railing against its own impermanence”, as Le Bon puts it, beautifully. “When you’re in it, you feel like it will never end. And there is a comfort in that, because it keeps you attached to something that really meant, or means, something to you. Sometimes you don’t want it to end because it will keep you in those loops. Once you get out of them, that’s when it ends.”Historically a magnetically ambiguous lyricist, Le Bon wrote more directly than ever “because I was trying to communicate with myself”. She aimed to confront “the violence of seeing things as they actually are”. It’s hard, she says, when love is “mixed invention: the fractured nature of memory, memories of the future and what you hope something is.” On Is It Worth It (Happy Birthday)? she sings: “Dig deep, are you dumb or devout?” It’s the fine line between having faith in someone and duping yourself. “That sunk cost,” she says. “You continue to hope that something will change.” She thought she was singing to or about her former partner, but realised: “I am all the characters at once.” On About Time, she sings: “I’m not lying in a bed you made.” She says now: “It’s the bed I’ve made really, isn’t it?”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

When women make decisions for themselves, says Le Bon, “it’s often coupled with a shame of sorts, a feeling of your responsibility for other people’s feelings or emotions: that you’re unable to carry everything for someone because you love them so much.” She keeps returning to a quote by author Alice Munro: “When a man goes out of the room, he leaves everything in it behind … When a woman goes out she carries everything that happened in the room along with her.” Michelangelo Dying, says Le Bon, contains no profound revelations. “It’s about putting things down so you can unencumber yourself and move on. Making decisions that are much more aligned with reality.”The album’s imagery was inspired by another room, Tunisian-American artist Colette Lumiere’s installation Recently Discovered Ruins of a Dream, depicting a woman alone in a chamber lavishly draped with fabric, with mirrors. “That’s what I really wanted the record to feel like,” says Le Bon. “You can roll up your sleeves and take something on, then you have a rest, because something is resolved.” Trying to run past heartache, she says, meant “forgetting the best part, where you reap the rewards of your work; that period of absorbing what has just happened”.We talk again a few weeks later, when Le Bon is with Dry Cleaning near the Loire valley. It’s her day off. Later, she’s going to swim in a lake and go to the supermarket for continental treats. They have consumed much bread and wine. “I’m really enjoying being here and being really present,” she says. “The band just keep revealing themselves to be more and more lovely.”Relationships such as this have become paramount. “I’ve learned something about decentralising the importance of romantic love,” she says. “In this past year I’ve seen that Delmi” – the friend she met when she was 11 years old – “is one of the great loves of my life. Seeing things as they are, you can welcome things in that complement you better. That forest fire of romantic love makes you abandon a lot of things.”The past few years have also recalibrated Le Bon’s relationship with music. Before making 2019’sReward, she took a year off to study carpentry, just to make sure she was making music out of heart, not habit. Her recent break taught her that sometimes “you have to stop something you really love because you love it too much. You have to really take care of your relationship with something like music when you love it but it’s also your job. It’s a practice. It can’t just be a feeling that you gorge on.”Cale tells me he admires Le Bon’s “constant evolution: you really don’t know what you’ll get but you know it’ll be sincere, honest, thoughtful.” She returns the compliment. “He’s been in one of the biggest, most influential bands, then as a solo artist he’s kept this forward motion where he’s tried to uncouple himself from that. He’s constantly shedding so he can get to the next thing. Because of that, he’s all the ages and no age at all. He’s got his head down in the purpose and intention of creating. And I find that really inspiring.”‘Together in creativity for peace!’ Sain, the indie label pushing Welsh music forward for 56 yearsRead moreYou can imagine dozens of younger artists saying the same about Le Bon: she’s such a potent influence that a Fake Le Bon seems to pop up every other week. It’s not in her nature to have noticed: whatever identity traps or “self-referencing” social media encourages in artists now, “I try heavily to avoid that in quite a violent way,” she says. “I never think about anything I’ve just done, and then I think about what I can do next. I think it’s healthier. It lends itself to a lightness, a freedom that makes you more porous to doing things differently the next time.”Le Bon isn’t touring Michelangelo Dying until October. “I wish we were starting tomorrow,” she says. In the meantime, her dream room of one’s own is a big garage to do all her projects in. At home, she will walk Mila, read Renata Adler,Rachel Cusk, keep going to the women’s boxing group she joined recently. She’s left the heartbreak behind. “That choice to take it on, and not just put it aside, but really heal from it and learn from it, has allowed me to shed it all.”Michelangelo Dying is released on 26 September.Explore more on these topicsCate Le BonPop and rockfeaturesShareReuse this content"

She talks about her long road to recognition, and using her profile to support other writersLisa AllardiceSun 8 Jun 2025 07.00 EDTShareBack in 2013, Bernardine Evaristo gave a reading in a south London bookshop from her novelMr Loverman. Only six people showed up, a couple of them were dozing and she realised they were homeless people who had come to find somewhere comfortable to sleep. Last month, the hit TV adaptationMr Loverman, about a 74-year-old gay Caribbean man set in Hackney, east London, wontwo Baftas, including leading actor forLennie James, making him the first Black British actor to win the TV award in its 70-year history. “I checkedWikipedia!” Evaristo exclaims of this shocking fact when we meet in London.Evaristo’s long career is one of firsts and creating them for others. In 2019, at the age of 60, she became the first Black woman to win the Booker prize –shared with Margaret Atwood– forGirl, Woman, Other, 12 interwoven stories of Black, female and one non-binary character. She is also the first Black woman to become president of the Royal Society of Literature (RSL) – only the second woman in its 200-year history, not to mention the first not to have attended Oxford, Cambridge or Eton. And this week she became the recipient of the Women’s prize inaugural Outstanding Contribution award.“I became an ‘overnight success’,” she writes of her Booker win in her 2021 memoir, Manifesto, “after 40 years working professionally in the arts.” It is these now 45 years that are being recognised by this new award. Ironically, she has never won the Women’s prize, although she wasshortlistedfor Girl, Woman, Other. “This award more than makes up for it,” she beams.View image in fullscreenThe Bafta-winning Mr Loverman was originally thought to be too ‘niche’ for TV.Photograph: Des Willie/BBC/Fable PicturesThe Booker judges’ decision to break the rules and split the prize between Evaristo and Atwood caused anoutcry, with many accusing the panel of undermining the historic recognition of a Black female novelist. Evaristo was cheerfully unperturbed. “It couldn’t have gone better for me, to be honest,” she insists now. “I really do mean that. In terms of how it accelerated my career and gave me so many more opportunities and such a large audience for my work.” Girl, Woman, Other was on the bestseller list for nine consecutive weeks. Barack Obamachoseit as one of his favourite books of 2019. Hamish Hamilton reissued her backlist. After being told for decades that there was no market for her work, she was suddenly in demand.So much so that a 2021 Private Eye cartoon – now on her fridge – showed a guy exclaiming: “Come quick!Bernardine Evaristoisn’t on Radio 4!” Although she found it funny, there is an unmistakeable whiff of condescension. “Why notice me?” she asks. “When there are many people who are constantly in the media, who are not Black women. You notice the Black woman and suddenly it’s too much. You want us to be quiet and invisible.”Tall and good-naturedly open, Evaristo is in no danger of keeping quiet or becoming invisible. Today she is wearing a hot-pink blouse the same shade as the trouser suit she wore to the Booker ceremony, her curls kept in check by a colourful headscarf. She is interested in power, how those outside the establishment can succeed without abandoning their own identities. “The headline is going to be ‘I want power!’” she hoots, as one not unfamiliar with controversy (the traditionally sleepy RSL has had more than its share ofheadlinesunder her tenure). “What do we mean when we say power?” she says seriously. “Influence, to have an impact, to effect change, to assume leadership positions? It’s so important that power is shared out.” Unlike the late poetBenjamin Zephaniah, who rejected an OBE, Evaristo accepted hers in 2020, arguing that not to do so is to risk enforcing the idea of“white honours for white British people”.Every decade, we are evolving. From my childhood to today, we have evolvedHow does it feel to be at the heart of the establishment, to no longer be “throwing stones at the fortress”, as she puts it in Manifesto? “I still believe in what I believe in. I’m just much more capable and careful, hopefully strategic and able to have more of an impact than I did when I was in my 20s,” she says, reminding me that she has been professor of creative writing at Brunel University for many years now. “You go through an angry period – as you get older you can’t keep that up – but I’m still very alert to the inequality in the world, and also inequality in my industry. I am not there to endorse the status quo. I’m there to bring other people with me and to open the doors, always, to great talent.”She has not just opened doors but built them where none existed. From the moment she graduated from Rose Bruford drama school in 1982 and co-founded theTheatre of Black Womenwith fellow students, the playwrightPatricia Hilaireand directorPaulette Randall,she has set about making things happen. Those early days were not just about creating theatre, she says now, but also work. “Because we were just so unemployable as Black women.” They put on Jackie Kay’s first playChiaroscuroin 1986.Since then, Evaristo has set upprojects,mentoring schemesandprizesfor under-represented poets and novelists. She has run workshops and courses, sat on judging panels (47, by her last count) and boards (“not something I necessarily want to do, trust me!”). Most recently, she launched theBlack Britain: Writing Backseries with her long-term publisher Simon Prosser at Hamish Hamilton, republishing 13 books by writers of colour since 1900. She plans to donate all her “huge” prize money (£100,000) from this latest award to an as yet undisclosed project to support other writers.She hasn’t done all this because she is “saintly. Clearly not!” she laughs. Throughout our conversation, she is at pains not to sound like a “do-gooder”: we are here to talk about her outstanding contribution, I remind her. “If I’m asked to do something, I need to accept the invitation, so that I can make a difference,” she explains. “It is very important for me as a Black, British, working-class, now-older woman to acknowledge that really important position.”The fourth of eight siblings, Evaristo grew up in “an activist household”, she says. Her Nigerian father was a welder who became a local Labour councillor, her mother, a devout Catholic from an Irish family, was a primary school teacher and trade union rep. Evaristo’s childhood in Woolwich, south-east London, in the 1960s was one of racial insults and smashed windows. Her father kept a hammer at the side of the bed for his whole life in England. The young Bernardine developed a “self-protective force field” that persists to this day, along with a determination to fight her corner – with words.After leaving home for drama school at 18, her 20s were spent in a blaze of cigarettes and love affairs – with women – hustling for jobs and moving between the various short-term housing available in the 80s. “I really cherish that period,” she says. She has been straight for 35 years, and today lives with her husband in the outskirts of west London; she has swapped the Marlboro Reds and Drambuie for yoga and meditation.In her 30s, before the boom in creative writing courses, she signed up for a personal development course. “My parents were not part of the elite,” she explains. “So they weren’t going to pass on to me strategies for how to succeed.” Evaristo was manifesting long before Instagram promised us we could live our best lives. The course made her realise “you can change big and you can expect the best. So why not go for that?” she says. She wrote a note to herself that she would win the Booker prize one day. The next three decades were spent working really hard to make it happen. “Nobody was waiting for me to publish books. Nobody was commissioning me,” she has said in aradio interview. “I just wrote on spec and hoped that somebody would publish me.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

Lara, a verse-novel based on her parents’ marriage, came out three years later. Then cameThe Emperor’s Babe, another verse-novel and her first with Penguin, which imagines life for a Black girl in Roman London.Soul Tourists, a zany road trip packed with Black ghosts from white western history;Blonde Roots, a satire that reverses the power dynamics of the slave trade; and a novella called Hello Mum, about a 14-year-old boy growing up on a council estate, followed. All her novels deal with the African diaspora in some way, mixing history, stylistic experimentalism and humour. “I’m always going for the difficult stories and to be subversive,” she says. “I’m always looking to find original ways into what I’m writing about.”Mr Loverman “felt like a taboo subject”. Much has been written about the Windrush generation, but no stories that she knew of told a love story between two elderly Caribbean men. When it was first published, she was told it was“too niche”to be adapted for television, because its protagonist, Barrington Jedidiah Walker, “was Black, old and gay”.While her reputation was steadily building, sales were not. She wouldn’t even look at her royalty statements when they arrived each year. Then, finally, her much-manifested breakthrough came. With Girl, Woman, Other she set out “to explore as many Black women in a single novel as possible”, ranging in age from 19 to 93, all with different backgrounds, faiths, sexualities and classes. Amma, a lesbian playwright, is clearly a version of Evaristo’s younger self. Once again, in a style she calls “fusion fiction”, she plays fast and loose with punctuation in favour of the rhythms of speech and thought. Here are the monologues of the silenced women Evaristo wrote for the theatre all those years ago.Her Booker win coincided with a long-overdue effort to make publishing more inclusive. “George Floyd,” she says, when I ask what she thinks was the catalyst for this change. “There was already an awareness of it, but definitely theGeorge Floyd murderandBlack Lives Matterwas a turning point.” Where once she knew every writer of colour in publishing, and could count them on one hand, she says, today she can’t keep up.“Identity politics has always existed,” she says of today’s culture wars. “We just didn’t name it that.” Last year, she wrote a piece in the Guardian refuting the“false allegations” against the RSLand the rumours that she had swept in with “radical” new measures for appointing fellows, sidelining older, more established names. “It’s a great honour and a privilege,” she says mischievously when I press her for more. “There’s always this argument that if things diversify, standards are dropped.”Evaristo even manages to bring positive thinking to our current global predicament. “Every decade, we are evolving. From my childhood to today, we have evolved,” she says. “We can’t do anything about America, but we can put up a fight in this country.”Of all these achievements, what makes her most proud? “I feel I can enjoy the successes I’ve had of late,” she replies without hesitation, “because I know I haven’t kept it to myself.”Bernardine Evaristo is the winner of the Women’s prize outstanding contribution award.www.womensprize.com.Explore more on these topicsBernardine EvaristoWomen's prize for fictionWomen's prizesAwards and prizesFictionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Often given as a wedding present, these vases were usually passed down as family heirlooms, revealing the accessibility of art deco works, she says, gesturing to the glass cabinet beside her. “If you were a collector, you could find works that cost a fortune, but these pieces were destined for people of more modest means for very reasonable prices.”Art deco was the first artistic movement that sought to appeal to a wider public beyond the elites, say the organisers of a new exhibition dedicated to the artistic movement of the interwar years, co-curated by Dubois, the president of the Brussels Art Deco Society.The exhibition, which opened this month at the BELvue museum in Brussels, brings together for the first time works owned by the King Baudouin Foundation, which was founded through a donation from the late Belgian monarch in 1976. It is part of the Belgian capital’s year-long celebration of art deco – events and exhibitions torecognise and market Brusselsas a centre for the artistic movement known for its geometric designs, exotic motifs and opulent materials.View image in fullscreenTête de Femme by Oscar Jespers.Photograph: Benjamin De Vuyst/Galerie De VuystThrough this modest exhibition of sculptures, vases, furniture and everyday artworks, the museum aims to chart the evolution of art deco: from luxurious hand-crafted goods for the few, to mass-produced objects aimed at middle-class consumers around the world. “It’s the first style that spread in all layers of society, from the richest to the poor people,” says Werner Adriaenssens, another co-curator and an art history professor at the Free University of Brussels.During the interwar years, brightly coloured geometric-patterned ceramic tiles were exported from Belgium’s industrial heartlands all around the world. Ships left the port of Antwerp laden with tiles destined for kitchens, bathrooms and shops.Art deco was the first global style. From Paris, often credited as the birthplace of the movement, it spread to New York, Soviet Moscow, Shanghai, Beirut and Brussels.Many of the “wedding gift” vases were designed in the southern Belgium town of La Louvière by the Franco-Belgian artist Charles Catteau, who oversaw production of decorative ceramics at Boch Frères during the interwar years. The company was a Belgian offshoot of the Franco-Luxembourgish ceramics dynasty, founded 14 years after the Belgian revolution of 1830. By 1935 it employed 1,350 people. Catteau did not design all the pieces but supervised the models, colours and finish of the glazes. His signature was stamped on every piece, a kind of trademark.As art met commerce, governments realised the creative sector had economic weight. Economic considerations led Belgium’s government to participate in the International Exhibition of Modern Decorative and Industrial Arts in Paris in 1925, a show seen as the founding moment of the art deco movement, although almost no one used that term until decades later. “The only reason to participate for Belgium in 25 was that the government was convinced that the decorative hearts had an economic impact,” Adriaenssens said.View image in fullscreenPerle Fine by Oscar Jespers.Photograph: De VuystThat Paris exhibition in 1925 heralded a shift from art nouveau of the prewar years, especially in the depiction of women. No longer the dreamy feminine ideal of art nouveau, women in art deco were often elegant, stylised and powerful. Emblematic of the shift is a 1925 sculpture by the Flemish artist Oscar Jespers: influenced by cubism, the workFine Pearlshows a female face that is abstract, modern, ghost-like.Catteau’s vases reflect cubist influences, as well as a fascination with exotic birds and animals, probably inspired bythe Belgian Congo. According to Adriaenssens, art deco artists were the first to do market research. “They were really searching, what does the middle class want?” So they did not shy away from older themes, such as ancient Greek-inspired pottery, but with modern geometric shapes and glazes.Art nouveau, as the name implies, wanted to be new, Adriaenssens observed. “Art deco has not that aspiration to be completely new, but to be modern.”Explore more on these topicsArt and designCeramicsBelgiumEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

But she was also a fantasist who couldn’t be bothered to spend time raising meWhen Fear of Flying, her autobiographical novel about women’s sexual desires, came out in 1973, Erica Jong was suddenly big news. But growing up as her only child, I had a very different experienceMolly Jong-FastSun 8 Jun 2025 07.00 EDTShareIn August 1978, I was born in a hospital in Stamford, Connecticut. I came out with red hair. This was proof to my mother that I was special. The fantasy of my specialness continued my entire life. I was special even though I was dyslexic. I was special even though I got kicked out of college. I was special even though I was a drug addict. I was special despite my fatness. I was special despite all the evidence to the contrary. I was special because I was a piece of her.I read an interview with my mother in which the interviewer described me as a “stout” toddler. “Stout” means “kind of fat”. I never thought of a toddler as being able to be fat, but there it was.This is from that interview in the Washington Post: “Their daughter, Molly Miranda Jong-Fast, is two years old and red-headed. She was born between pages 284 and 285 of Fanny. Having the baby, Jong says, ‘transformed’ her. ‘In my 20s and early 30s I didn’t think I wanted children,’ she says. ‘But by the time I was 34 or 35, I realised that if I didn’t have a baby soon, it was going to be a matter of picking up every stray dog in Connecticut.’”I always wondered if she would have been better off with a dog.My mother isthe writer Erica Jong. She is a novelist, essayist and poet. She has published 27 books, the most famous of which is her autobiographical novelFear of Flying. It came out in 1973, five years before I was born, and is considered, in some corners at least, a landmark of feminist literature. Its candid depiction of women’s sexual desires was extremely shocking at the time. It has sold more than 20m copies, andJohn Updikecompared it to The Catcher in the Rye andPortnoy’s Complaint.Fear of Flyingmade her very famous, for a writer. She was a guest onThe Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson. She was on the cover of Newsweek.Gore Vidal and Henry Millerwere friends. I’m not here to brag about my mother’s friendships with dead writers. But a lot of younger people have no idea who she is.My mother coined an expression for casual sex: the “zipless fuck”. Now think about being the offspring of the person who wrote that sentence. And pour one out for me.I grew up with her everywhere – on television, in the crossword puzzle, in the newspaper. Mom was a kind of second-wave feminist, a white feminist, and an (highly educated, wildly affluent, Jewish and somewhat out-of-touch) everywoman. But she wasn’t an actual everywoman, of course; she was too famous for that. Too famous, and too special. She was famous for that book, then later she was famous for being famous, and then eventually she wasn’t famous any more. Because fame, like youth, is fleeting; it deserts you when you least expect it. The wheel of fortune is always spinning.Inever thought of myself as the star of my own life, or my own childhood. From a young age, I knew my mom was writing about me. I knew it because people would come up to me and ask me very personal questions, which meant that they knew things about me they couldn’t possibly know unless someone was telling them. I never knew quite what the other person knew about me. In some ways, it made me very good at talking to people; in other ways, it made me a psychopath. I never had privacy, so I never valued privacy. I just assumed everyone knew everything about me and about everyone else.When I was a kid, my mother published a children’s picture book about me because of course she did. She told me she wrote Megan’s Book of Divorceto help me deal with her divorce from my father. It’s a crazy piece of work. A blog called Awful Library Bookshad some fun with it, referencing, among other transgressions, something called “the bizarre underwear scene”. In the scene in question, I (or “Megan”) am not wearing underwear. I’m kneeling before my toy box and appear to be fellating a stuffed dog (naturally, I’m looking for my missing underwear). I am given the line, “I think divorce is dumb because I never remember where I left my underpants.” The publishers liked the butt drawing so much, they also put it on the back cover.View image in fullscreenErica and Molly in 2011.Photograph: Tim KnoxThis is not the only problem with the book. There is the reflexive racism (one of Megan’s nannies, Bessie-Lou, has “healin’ hands” and takes young Megan “to meet her pastor in Harlem. Hallelujah!”). There is the fact that Megan wants her mother to kill her stepmother. There are continuity issues, there is the ever-present Erica Jong problem of unexamined privilege, but the most obvious and tragic problem: the author of the book seems to have about as much familiarity with children as she would with extraterrestrials from Mars.Believe it or not, my mom sold the film rights to this picture book to ABC. A pilot was shot. They changed the title to Sambecause my dad threatened to sue my mom unless my name were changed. (Although my name in the book hadalreadybeen changed to Megan. By that point in my life, I had learned not to ask too many questions.)As another data point from the Megan’s Book of Divorcedebacle, I would like to submit this correction from a piece about me written in the New York Timesin 2022, which, for those keeping track at home, is 37 years after said sitcom. The correction was sent in by my father, who said: “An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that Molly Jong-Fast’s father, Jonathan Fast, sued her mother, Erica Jong, over Ms Jong’s depiction of a fictional character based on Ms Jong-Fast and her experience with her parents’ divorce. Mr Fast’s lawyer was involved in the dispute, but he did not file a lawsuit.”When the pilot was filmed in 1985, my mother took me out of school and moved us to LA for a month. We lived at the Beverly Hills hotel. I don’t remember much about living in LA except that it was yet another time when my mom was convinced that she had made it and wouldn’t have to worry about money any more. But the show was not picked up and we went home.What ended my parents’ union, I never could get a straight answer about. The reason I knew Mom was a liar was because her story always changed. Sometimes it was one thing, then sometimes it was an entirely different story. This shifting reality, this strange post-truth ecosystem she inhabited, and that for a time I inhabited, too, made me completely unable to know what was real and what was a lie with her. It was a kind of gaslighting by proxy, like Munchausen syndrome, but somehow much, much stupider. I grew up with a lot of mistrust about people. I was prickly. I was hard to connect with. I didn’t trust anyone. When I got sober at 19, I learned how to be an actual person. Before that I would do all sorts of alienating things and feel surprised when people felt alienated by me.Later my mother admitted they had an open marriage. My father, when questioned about this, said only, “Yes, shethoughtit was open.”“He was just too jealous of me,” she would tell me. My father was, at the time, working towards a master’s in social work. She said that kind of thing a lot, and about a lot of people. My father often said she was impossible to live with, an experience I’ve had first-hand. Should I blame the way she became on her fame, on all the years of people telling her she’d changed their lives? Or perhaps she was always like that.By the time I was born, Fear of Flyingwas already five years old. My unfamous father married a very famous woman, though they actually didn’t get married until my mom was pregnant with me because they both believed marriage was a bougie construct.My father’s famous father, communist hero Howard Fast, hadn’t been jailed or blacklisted since the 1940s, but he was still famous – or notorious – sort of. And Grandpa ended up back on the New York Times bestseller list much later, too, in the 80s, with a bunch of pulpy historical fiction novels. So my father had the double bad luck of being married to a famous writer and being the son of a famous writer.Even back then, I think that Mom was anxious about losing her fame. Mom clearly understood that fame was, even for most famous people, a temporary state. She was always convinced that someone might try and take her career away; the problem was, she was pretty sure it would be me.Mom was always convinced someone might try and take her career away; the problem was, she was pretty sure it would be meEventually, my dad moved out of our house. It was one of those epic divorces with teams of lawyers. And then mymomalso moved out of the house! She left me in Weston with my nanny, Margaret. Mom moved to New York and did the very 70s thing of sharing an apartment with another single gal. Let’s politely call the place where they lived their bachelorette pad. I stayed in the house in Weston for a year with Margaret, and eventually we were summoned back to New York. My mom had met a guy named Cash. He was in his 20s, and handsome. I assumed he was dumb, maybe he wasn’t. He was gone by the time I was old enough to make an assessment either way.Mom kept the place in Weston as her country house. I grew to loathe that house. Mostly it was the association of being left there alone with Margaret that year. It’s funny because when I was young my mom would tell me she was a great mom, then when I got a bit older, she would tell me that she practiced “benign neglect” – as if this parenting style was somehow by design.One day after she had tried this line on me too many times (obviously she felt terrible about the sort of mother she was), I just snapped and said, “It was justneglectneglect. Benign makes it sound intentional. Stopsayingthat.” She never said it again.I know how entitled I seem, complaining about my childhood. I mean, I never worked in a factory. I never wanted for one single material possession. Ever. Not once. I know how lucky I was, and am. I know how terrible the world is. But still. I want to tell the story not for any kind of pity, but for the hope that telling it will make me stop trying to relive it, will make my past go away. Even though I have spent my entire adulthood creating a different kind of life for myself, my head, my soul, my spirit – whatever you want to call it – is still stuck in the mire of my childhood.Mom was always travelling. There wasn’t an invitation to a book fair or festival, interview or speaking engagement that she’d decline. And when Momwasat home in New York, she was out dancing at Nell’s club, or fighting with Elaine, the owner of Elaine’s, the famous (infamous?) restaurant on the Upper East Side.Sometimes I’d be in bed and Mom would knock on my door, sometimes drunk and sometimes just tipsy, but always smelling of the most wonderful perfume. My bedroom was arguably the best room in the house – second floor, three huge windows, high, high ceilings. She’d peek her head in and stage-whisper, “I haveNew York Super Fudge Chunk!” Then she’d ask me if I wanted to go into her room and watch TV with her, on her bed.This was the best thing ever in the whole world. Margaret gave me a crazy strict bedtime, but when Mom would ask me to watch TV with her, I would run right up the stairs to her room and watch TV and eat ice-cream until my stomach hurt. I loved those nights so much.Mom would let me stay home from school the following day. She was a firm believer in mental health days. Margaret didn’t believe in mental health days, but my glamorous mom didn’t believe in the rules. Rules were for boring, unfamous people who balanced their cheque books. Rules were for normal people. My mother was not normal, nor did she want to be.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Photographs: courtesy of Molly Jong-FastTwo infamous/notorious sexologists, Phyllis and Eberhard Kronhausen, eventually moved into our ground floor, after their landlord, Shirley MacLaine, kicked them out of her apartment on Central Park West. It was nice to have someone else in the house, even if they were old and creepy and weirdly thin and leathery. They took handfuls of vitamins every day. Eventually, they moved back to their farm in Costa Rica. They told me I should come visit and I never did. They left the basement filled with erotic paintings as a gift to Mom.Most of the kids I knew growing up found the house, and our art, fascinating. My friend Ruthy couldn’t believe there was a painting of naked lesbians having sex at the top of the stairs. My other friend Juno wasn’t as shocked as Ruthy, but that was only because her parents were psychoanalysts and she had a male nanny.Much of my feminist mother’s time was occupied by men. But maybe, come to think of it, this shouldn’t come as all that much of a surprise to readers of her fiction. After all,in Fear of Flying, she wrote, “Underneath it all, you longed to be annihilated by love, to be swept off your feet, to be filled up by a giant prick spouting sperm, soapsuds, silks and satins, and of course, money.”And of course, money.She was always in love with someone. More often than not, it was a problematic man, a “no-account” count, a married writer who lived in Brooklyn, or a drug-addicted B-list actor. Between her divorce from my father (husband No 3) and her marriage tomy stepfather (husband No 4),there were numerous fiances. I couldn’t help but envision each one as a possible father. It would take me years to understand that the worst thing you could do to a kid was introduce her to possible stepfathers on a daily basis. But my feminist mother was always looking for someone to save her, someone to get her out of her own head.Where did those potential dads go? Did they end up finding other lives? Did they end up having other stepdaughters? Did they ever think about us? Even at the time I knew it was extremely strange to have all these adult men wander in and out of my life like actors auditioning for the part of playing the man who would eventually marry my mom.View image in fullscreen‘When you were little,’ Dad said, ‘I tried to get Mom to spend an hour a day with you. And she couldn’t do it.’Photograph: Caroll Taveras/The GuardianDid I mention those men ended up in the books? Because they did. Everyone ended up in her novels. Anyone who knew her knew that everything that happened went right into the books. Names were changed to make everything a little more pretentious, but some things were almost reported verbatim, and sometimes they were combined with weird hodgepodges of fantasies she had about other people. But the one thing that always happened was that she was the hero, always and for ever.I was 11 when Mom decided to marry Ken. They’d been going out for exactly 90 days. It was not my mother’s first engagement that year. But for whatever reason they decided to get married. The ceremony took place in the parking lot behind the humble ski condo Ken bought when he was living with the girlfriend who preceded Mom.Ken loved Mom.The rest of the world barely existed, mostly their reality was just their love for each other. I could tell I wasn’t really going to be a part of this new life. (Do I sound bitter?) I could sense that Ken wasn’t going to be much of a father to me. I recognised in him a kindred spirit, though not in a good way. He was loud. He was blustery. He was used to getting his own way. He thought he was always right. He ate Steak-umms for breakfast in his bathrobe.All these years later, I thank God for Ken. Had he not come along, I would have never survived my childhood, I would have been eclipsed by my mother’s need for me.Mom and Ken bought an apartment and right after we moved in, they fired Margaret. I was bereft. I wept. I had lost my best, and only, friend. I know how fucked up that is.Fast-forward to almost-present day. I spend my days feeling like a little girl wearing her mother’s enormous high heels through meetings with accountants and lawyers and doctors. I am talking to the movers and special fancy nursing home people who will charge lots of money for who knows what. Every day I visit Mom and Ken in the apartment I grew up in. They’re not children, not exactly, but they’re not adults any more either. They are like people, they look like people, but they aren’t making the kind of decisions that high- or even average-functioning people make.I will soon have to sell the apartment, at the bottom of the New York City real estate market. I have to manage things. I have finally made the decision to put my mother and stepfather in the World’s Most Expensive Nursing Home.I came to Mom and Ken’s apartment every day with a book about the nursing home, a luxe hardcover coffee-table book with beautiful pictures of the home’s five restaurants, its gym, its spa, its espresso lounge, its yoga studio, its saltwater pool. “You like to swim, right, Mom?” I’d ask. Every day, I’d sit in their dog pee-smelling apartment and show them the pages of the book. Mom was impressed by the restaurants. Sometimes they seemed open to the idea of moving, and sometimes not. And, just like Brigadoon, the thought would vanish and every night they’d forget the conversation. So every morning I’d have to remind them.View image in fullscreen‘I always wondered if she would have been better off with a dog.’Photograph: Caroll Taveras/The GuardianI’d say happy, positive things like, “It’s a hotel!” and, “It’s like it’s the Four Seasons!” And it trulyislike the Four Seasons. And probably even more expensive. It is beautifully designed – airy and light. I said things to make myself feel better, but it wasn’t clear that they knew what anything I was saying meant, and the reality of what I was doing did not change. I was putting them in a home. I was doing it because they both have dementia. I was doing it because I am a bad daughter who won’t devote her life to taking care of them, the way my sister-in-law did for my in-laws. I am a bad daughter. But, then again, they were terrible parents, so perhaps we’re tied.In my dark moments, I’m honest with myself. I know what I’m doing is wrong. I know they don’t want to go there. They are special. They have always thought of themselves as just a little too special to do the stuff normal people do. They have always considered themselves to be just a little too good for normal life.Today was move-in day. “We gave you power of attorney, and you put us in a home,” Mom said, as we arrived at the World’s Most Expensive Nursing Home. This was, on the face of it, true. Basically, the whole thing was reverse summer-camp drop-off. You lied to your parents just like you lied to your kids. But with the kids, you knew that they were going for a short period of time. With the parents, they were going for ever. With the kids, you knew you were doing something for their own good; with the parents, you were not so sure. Also, with the kids, you were pretty confident that they weren’t going to die there. With your parents, you knew they were.A couple of days later, I called my dad, my one remaining parent. I was in a taxi heading to CNN, to do a late-night panel. I told him Mom wasn’t dead yet but she wasn’t exactly there any more. I told him all she did was sleep and drink. I told him how guilty I felt. I said that I shouldn’t be at the CNN studios. Wherever I was, I felt I should have been somewhere else. I should have been spending more time with my kids, with my parents, with my dogs, with my husband who was very ill.Emma Brockes: Emma Brockes on how Erica Jong’s 1973 novel nearly blew the bowl haircut off her 13-year-old headRead moreMy dad tried to reassure me in his own peculiar, fucked-up way. “You know,” he said, “when you were a little girl, the nanny and I used to try and get your mom to spend time with you. We tried to get her to spend justan hour a daywith you.”This admission made me feelsogreat.“And she couldn’t do it,” my dad said. “She couldn’t even spendone hourwith you. The most she could do was half an hour.”Now, maybe my father was trying to use this knowledge as a way to make me feel less guilty about putting her in a home. Because when I go to visit her, she is always crying. She wasn’t a crier when I was a child, but she cries a lot now. Everyone who works there is worried about Mom. They are worried about the crying, but they are really,reallyworried about the drinking. And the more she drinks, the more she cries. (And the more she cries, the more she drinks.)I am the only bit of Erica Jong in the universe except for her, but she sits in a nursing home reading and rereading the newspaper.I had spent my entire life trying to get away from the loneliness of being abandoned by my parents. I assumed this would somehow preclude me from mourning their deaths. Like with almost everything in my life, I was deeply wrong. You can’t pre-grieve your parents, much as you might want to, or need to. As an addict, I was always looking for a quick fix, a way to skip the hard work. I was the second or third generation in the family to love diet pills. I would take them instead of eating. You can cheat your weight, but you can’t cheat grief. Even if your parents never loved you, or you never loved them, or some weird combination of the two, grief still comes for all of us.This is an edited extract from How to Lose Your Mother by Molly Jong-Fast, published by Picador on 26 June at £16.99.

While efforts continue to restore the spa town to its former glory, silence and greenery prevail as a few families hold out amid the rubbleByLaura Fornell. Photographs by Oscar EspinosaSun 8 Jun 2025 02.00 EDTShareThe right to rest for workers was enshrined in the 1936 constitution of the Soviet Union. Article 119 guaranteed “annual vacations with full pay for workers and employees and the provision of a wide network of sanatoriums”. Fourteen years earlier, the 1922 labour code had established that every worker was entitled to two weeks of annual leave and hundreds of sanatoriums were built across the vast territory that made up the Soviet socialist republics. These establishments, conceived as a combination of health resorts and medical centres, served as places for workers to rest and recuperate, thus helping to optimise their productivity.View image in fullscreenBath House No 8, located in Central Park where the hot springs spring forth, is the UFO-shaped Tskaltubo spa with a curved, circular roof and a central opening that lets in light.InGeorgia, Stalin’s native country, one of the Soviet Union’s leading spa towns was forged south of the Great Caucasus mountains. Tskaltubo’s radon mineral springs, with temperatures of 33-35C, could be used without prior heating and put the town in the spotlight. In 1920, the territory was nationalised and five years later the first facilities were built. In 1931, the Georgian Soviet socialist republic designated Tskaltubo as a premium spa complex and balneotherapy centre. In 1933, an ambitious plan for the spa resort was launched, arranging its infrastructure in a circle around the springs, and two further masterplans followed in the 50s and 80s. From the late 20s to the late 80s several hotels, nine bathhouses, 22 sanatoriums and a hydro-mineral research centre were built, many of them real gems of Soviet architecture.View image in fullscreenA large dome with a small skylight and open arches stands at one end of the Imereti sanatorium, built in 1961, illuminating what was once an elegant concert hall.Hundreds of thousands of visitors came to Tskaltubo during its golden years and it was declared a city in 1953. A railway line connected it directly to Moscow. Apart from the workers who came with theirputevki, vouchers issued by a doctor for free treatment, the spa town also became one of the most popular holiday spots for the Soviet elite. The booming spa industry in Tskaltubo led to years of great prosperity and within five decades its population grew to 21,000, according to the last Soviet census in 1989. But the picture changed dramatically in December 1991 with the collapse and dissolution of the USSR and Tskaltubo stopped receiving visitors overnight. But a year later, in 1992, most of the abandoned buildings began to receive thousands of refugees fleeing the war in Abkhazia. The spa town became a temporary refuge for 10,000 internally displaced people who were housed in the former sanatoriums, a situation that lasted for 30 years.View image in fullscreenElguja Kovalini, 65, took refuge with his wife and children in the Tskaltubo sanatorium 31 years ago after fleeing the conflict in Abkhazia. Today they are one of 12 families still living there.Silence and vegetation have overtaken the decrepit concrete, stone and marble structures. A few families resist amid the rubble and rubbish. “I’ve lived here for almost half my life,” says Elguja Kovalini, 65, who arrived at the age of 34 with his wife and two young children, fleeing the conflict in Abkhazia. The Kovalini family settled in the Tskaltubo, one of the oldest sanatoriums in the city. The main three-storey U-shaped building was built in 1931 and between 1967 and 1971 two more wings were added to accommodate more rooms for the then flourishing spa business. The rooms later housed up to 765 displaced families, mostly from Gagra, where they stayed for three decades waiting for the conflict to end so they could return home. It was not until 2021 that many displaced families were housed in new apartments. “Today there are only 12 families left in the sanatorium,” Kovalini says from one of the old sanatorium rooms converted into a house. “It has not been easy, we never imagined we would be here for so long, but today it is our home.”View image in fullscreenA long paved path with small flights of steps leads to the main entrance of the Medea sanatorium, which in 2021 was declared a cultural heritage monument of Georgia.Not far away, in another wing of the same sanatorium, Gia Bakradze, 60, checks on the homemade alcohol he is preparing. As his neighbours have moved away, he and his wife have taken up more space and occupy an entire corridor of the former sanatorium. Several huddled cats sleep in the corridor decorated with the Bakradzes’ plants. “Now everyone has left, we take care of the cats,” says Bakradze as he strokes one of them, “although I guess they don’t have much time left here either”.View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenA portrait recalls the passage of internally displaced people who converted Medea sanatorium’s once elegant rooms into homes where they took shelter after fleeing Abkhazia.

Right: A bathroom in the former Rkinigzeli sanatorium, which for decades was used by internally displaced people who fled the conflict in Abkhazia and took refuge here.Efforts have been under way for more than a decade to restore Tskaltubo to its former splendour as a leading hydrotherapy resort, starting with the rehabilitation of the central park where the springs are located. Successive governments have come up with several redevelopment plans to revive the spa town along the lines of those devised in Soviet times to attract private investors. The Georgian state put the 22 sanatoriums up for sale, first in 2013 and then in 2018 and although several were acquired by foreign investment companies, nothing came to fruition as the state had not yet resolved the relocation of the displaced people who had settled in the former sanatoriums. In 2022, after most Abkhaz families had finally been offered a way out, the ministry of economy presented a new investment project called New Life of Tskaltubo, announcing the privatisation of the 14 sanatoriums that had not yet been sold, for 50m Georgian lari (£13.5m).View image in fullscreenThe magnificent staircases of the foyer to the Imereti sanatorium are falling apart.In September 2023, a Qatari company acquired Tskaltubo, where the Bakradzes, Kovalinis and 10 other families still live, for 2.6m lari. The sale includes the obligation to invest more than 7.8m lari in the development within five years. “There have already been other cases where the buyer has not fulfilled its obligations and the state has taken back the property,” says Bakradze, referring to the Meshakhte sanatorium, an impressive building from 1952 that was completely abandoned and privatised in 2015 for 2.5m lari on the condition its new owner from the United Arab Emirates would develop a five-star hotel by 2018. Meshakhte was returned to the state in 2023 due to the investor’s breach of contract.View image in fullscreenThe south facade of the Metalurg sanatorium had access to an elegant gallery overlooking a courtyard which has now disappeared amid the wild vegetation.Although rehabilitation work on some of the privatised sanatoriums has already begun – on the Tbilisi sanatorium, for example, a prominent building from 1951 guarded by two tetramorphic griffins – more than half of the sanatoriums have yet to be sold, despite the fact they have been continually put up for sale since August 2022.View image in fullscreenSiblings Saba and Nia, aged six and three, play in the corridors of Rkinigzeli sanatorium, which they call home.Children’s laughter escapes from one of the crumbling sanatoriums. Saba, six, kicks a ball through the deserted corridors of the Rkinigzeli sanatorium, while his little sister, Nia, three, chases him. Today they are the only children living in this ghostly setting which they call home. “When I was little, there were a lot of children,” says their mother, Irina Bondarevi, 39, who also grew up here. She was nine when she and her family fled Abkhazia. “Of the 500 families that came to live here, only three of us remain,” says Bondarevi, who has not yet received a house to where she can move permanently with her parents, husband and children.View image in fullscreenThe Rkinigzeli sanatorium at its peak housed 350 patients and later provided shelter to more than 500 families displaced by the Abkhaz conflict.View image in fullscreenIrina Bondarevi, 39, with her children Saba, six, and Nia, three, in one of the rooms at Rkinigzeli sanatorium which has been converted into a kitchen. Bondarevi arrived here aged nine, after fleeing the conflict in Abkhazia with her parents.The children, oblivious to their surroundings, play outside the dilapidated five-storey building constructed in 1954. The sanatorium received up to 350 patients during its most prosperous period and housed medical and diagnostic laboratories specialising in cardiovascular diseases. Across the road, a hidden path leads through a wooded area to another abandoned sanatorium, the Metalurg. The imposing four-storey building from 1957, with its huge, arched glass window decorated with carved stone, was declared a cultural heritage monument of Georgia in 2021.View image in fullscreenTania Jan, 60, arrived at the Metalurg sanatorium in 1992 with her three children, fleeing the conflict in Abkhazia, where her husband died.“We are only 13 families left living here now,” says Tania Jan, 60, who moved into the Metalurg sanatorium in 1992 with her three children after her husband died fighting in the Abkhaz conflict. “We had grown to 700 families,” adds her neighbour Mindadze Gurau, 60, who has also lived with his wife in this building for more than 30 years. “For decades we have all maintained this place as best we could, but we don’t have much time left and it is falling apart.” The Metalurg is one of the best-preserved sanatoriums, although it, too, was ransacked like all the others. With no means to survive, the displaced Abkhazians removed many of the items that could be reused or sold, such as furniture, lamps, radiators, bathtubs or tiles that had not been looted before their arrival, and even used the elegant old wooden floors as firewood for cooking and heating.View image in fullscreenLittle remains today of the majestic concert hall of the Metalurg sanatorium, once used by patients suffering from arthritic diseases.View image in fullscreenDuring Tskaltubo’s heyday, Metalurg sanatorium guests ate their meals in a dining room resembling a greenhouse surrounded by large windows.Very few refugees, like Tania, remain in Tskaltubo’s abandoned sanatoriums. “So far we have not been offered any better option,” she says from the lobby of the Metalurg, which still has its original chandelier and wooden and wrought-iron railings. “We can’t afford to pay for another house, so soon I don’t know what will become of us once again …” Most displaced people, however, have been rehoused and work has begun on rebuilding some of the decaying buildings of this unique spa town.View image in fullscreenInternally displaced people who took refuge in the Gelati sanatorium covered the balustrade with bricks and put up panelled enclosures and windows to convert the former balconies into kitchens.Explore more on these topicsThe Guardian picture essayGeorgiaRussiaJoseph StalinArchitectureEuropefeaturesShareReuse this content"

She is a self-composed politician, he is a burnt-out lawyer turned anxious school teacher. They have been married for 20 years and we meet them in the morning discussing toast, problem students and political campaigns before they set off into their working day.It is ordinary life, given an extraordinary theatrical twist in its performance as it’s two agile actors play every character that the central couple meets as well as Nina (Anna Schudt), and Mark (Jörg Hartmann) themselves.German director Thomas Ostermeier recently directed another Nina in Anton Chekhov’s The Seagull, at the Barbican, in London. This play was, in fact, staged in Berlin in 2024 but now makes its Italian premiere at theVenice BiennaleTeatro, and the Nina here is given a moral dilemma over a shelter for abused women when she is blackmailed by a constituent.Secrets between the couple are revealed as well as prickly encounters with colleagues and work tensions. The actors are fast and adept in their switches between 23 characters, including schoolchildren, hairdressers (both Hartmann, the latter very entertaining), overbearing bosses (Schudt, the same). The most outrageous switch comes when Nina meets her elderly father at the zoo for lunch and Hartmann goes from playing the zoo’s resident elephant to a chimpanzee.The lightning fast or outre characterisations are highly virtuoso but some feel like diversions in Maja Zade’s script, played for laughs, and there to showcase the actors’ talents. If the point of the play itself is to highlight the artifice – and art – of acting, it seems laboured and gathers little depth.There are intrigues, such as a secret drink habit and child loss as well as the plot line of blackmail. But the comic delight to some of the actors’ role juggling (especially the elephant and hairdresser scenes) introduces a tone of play and levity that sits at odds with these serious themes.Muted music comes on at odd moments, in the middle of a scene sometimes, low in volume and wafting on and off as if by accident. Magda Willi’s set design works better, part realist but gestural too with a clothes rail at one side to aid speedy costume changes and screens that light up to show the movement of the day through street scenes.The title of the play evidently refers to the changes that this couple are trying to make in their lives, and in the world. But it is the actors’ accomplished changes that become the central drama here.Until 8 June as part of theBiennale Teatro 2025.

An encore occurs because the audience wants more.” Since their initial breakup in 2002, Pulp have re-formed twice, for sold-out tours and festival sets played to loyal, rapturous audiences. Tonight, the stakes are higher: for the first time in 24 years,Pulp have a new album, More, released just one day before tonight’s opening show. The audience want more – but do they want More?Pulp: More review – anthems and rage for the next life stageRead moreAny anxiety about new material is quashed when set opener and comeback single Spike Island is received like an old friend. Jarvis Cocker rises from the back of the stage flanked by cardboard cutouts of his bandmates – recognisable from the cover of 1995’s Different Class – before joining their real-life counterparts, guitarist Mark Webber, drummer Nick Banks and keyboardist Candida Doyle, downstage. Continuing this mood, old and new songs on the setlist complement each other: the spacious psychedelia of More’s Farmer’s Market leads into the wide-eyed wonder of Sunrise from We Love Life; and the high stakes disco of O.U. (Gone, Gone) is echoed in its new counterpart Got to Have Love. With its illuminated staircase, kitschy backdrops and full string section, the stage is reminiscent of a 1970s chatshow set, with Cocker holding court in a corduroy suit, taking a seat – and occasionally laying down – during the spoken word sections, but always captivating.View image in fullscreenLuxe melodrama … Jarvis Cocker with Pulp at OVO Hydro.Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The GuardianThe setlist caters for fans of most Pulp eras, but This Is Hardcore heads are truly spoiled, with Help the Aged and The Fear both played live for the first time in over a decade. The latter sees Cocker share the limelight with four inflatable air dancers, somehow perfectly encapsulating the song’s ennui in their gigantic absurdity. This Is Hardcore begins with the strings-only End of the Line mix, maximising the luxe melodrama before laying on its heavy dread. A hits-packed final run ends with Common People, somehow still thrilling – and relevant – 30 years after its release. The curtains are drawn, but the band return for a semi-acoustic version of A Sunset, the final track from More. It says a lot about this beloved group that, after playing their biggest hit, they can play an album track released yesterday to the same rapt attention.Pulp tour the UK and Ireland until 21 JuneExplore more on these topicsMusicPop and rockreviewsShareReuse this content"

The stable courtyard at Nevill Holt wasconverted into a comfortable 400-seat opera houseseven years ago, and now this year’s festival also offers the first fruits of a tie-up with Leeds-based Opera North, who will take a new production south for the coming five years.This summer’s Così Fan Tutte offers alternating casts under the assured and energised conducting of Chris Hopkins. But it is not in every respect a wholly new production. Cecilia Stinton’s direction and George Leigh’s designs provide a specially created version of Mozart’s opera for the Nevill Holt residency. Yet there remain traces, notably in the costumes, ofthe Tim Albery productionthat did sterling work for Opera North from 2009. Perhaps it is best to think of this as a country house remix of Albery’s Cosi.Another survival is that this version is in English. This brings terrific immediacy, even for those who can follow Lorenzo Da Ponte’s punning Italian original. The programme gives no single writer the credit, but it is a witty and succinct translation that adds to the overall fun and pace. “One man is as good as another; and they are all good for nothing,” sings Dorabella, as she and her sister Fiordiligi debate how to deal with their respective suitors.View image in fullscreenVery much the puppet-master … Will Dazeley as Don Alfonso and Claire Lees as Despina in Così Fan Tutte at the Nevill Holt festival.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianStinton places the cynical philosopher Don Alfonso at the centre of things. This Alfonso is not simply trying to prove his misogynistic point about women’s affections. He is trying to prove it inside an opera-within-an-opera version of Così that he is himself writing and directing. Confused? It sometimes gets that way. But it is a device that offers plenty of opportunities for stage farce, as well as adding fresh layers of transgressive ambiguity to an opera that is already full of them.Vocally, all six principals make a mark. Seán Boylan’s stylish Guglielmo and Egor Zhuravskii’s ardently sung Ferrando are a well-matched pair of officers turned increasingly troubled pawns in Alfonso’s game. Among the women, Ella Taylor’s Fiordiligi is particularly fine in their two formidable arias and for their ability to command expressive softness as well as strength. Heather Lowe’s Dorabella is bright voiced and engagingly acted. Claire Lees knows all the ropes as Despina and has little difficulty stealing the show when she needs to do so.It helps most of all, though, that William Dazeley is such a well acted and sung Alfonso. Mozart may have denied Alfonso the chance to shine in an aria of his own, but he is very much the puppet-master. Or at least in this version he is until the final moments, when his traumatised charges finally revolt against his loveless philosophy and chase him from the stage.Nevill Holt festival continues until 22 JuneThis article was amended on 8 June 2025 to reflect the fact that Ella Taylor’s preferred pronouns are they/them.Explore more on these topicsOperaClassical musiclive music reviewsShareReuse this content"

On that count, no one can accuse the forces that enlisted Dafoe as Venice Biennale Teatro’s artistic director of a cynically celebrity-led appointment.‘Theatre puts a finger in the wound’: Willem Dafoe returns to his first love in VeniceRead moreDafoe’s programme expressly reflects the influences and passions that shaped him, not least the Wooster Group, a New York company he co-founded which appears in his Venice lineup. But the risk with this personal nod to the past is that the once-edgy becomes dated experimentalism.That certainly seems the case with this “experiment”, a directorless two-hander in which Dafoe stars alongside Simonetta Solder. Its basis is a series of notes on index cards written by the late American playwright,Richard Foreman– an avant gardist if ever there was one.View image in fullscreenTrapped on an island of broken glass … Dafoe and Solder in No Title (An Experiment).Photograph: andrea avezzuDafoe and Solder sit around a table upon a circular mound that is bound by tape, like the cordon at a crime scene. They kick off by drinking a glass of water and smashing it across a heap of broken glass that surrounds them. The suggestion is that the glass has accumulated in an infinitely repeating show, the actors trapped on the island of glass with their index cards.They read them alternately and at quite a pace. Seemingly random thoughts repeat; they are playful, quotidian or profound, and circle around certain themes: time, sleep, shoes. It is less a game of association than a deliberately fragmentary exercise which does not build to a bigger story. Paradoxes crash against each other (“Nasty is nice”, “So tired I woke up”, “Tomorrow comes”, “Tomorrow is yesterday”) while homilies turn wonky (“Better never than late”, “Hurt gently”, “Time explains it all”).Dafoe is expressive and relaxed, at least, as well as Solder.“Language is a bitch,” she says. It sure is here. When the actors switch to speaking in Italian (translated by Matilde Vigna), language really does seem so – for English speakers at least.Is the idea that we, as the audience, begin to create a narrative out of fragments? That the creation of story is irresistible? Whose failure is it if no narrative forms? That question lingers, but in the meantime it is oddly banal. It seems ironic that the title of Dafoe’s programme is “Theatre is body. Body is Theatre”. This feels like conceptual theatre, about ideas not movement, the actors effectively reduced to their voices.In between the index card table tennis is infectiously jazzy music and mischievous polka dot lighting. You hope that Dafoe and Solder will rise and do a jazzy jig. They don’t, until taking their final, shimmying bows.As experimental as it may be, it seems old-fashioned in its play with meaning and story, while also hagiographic towards Foreman – a show given over to the reading aloud of his index card scribblings. It calls itself an experiment. It feels more like a puzzle with its dramatic parts, and heart, missing.Part of theBiennale Teatro 2025, which takes place until 15 June.Arifa Akbar’s trip was provided by Venice BiennaleExplore more on these topicsTheatreVenice BiennaleWillem DafoereviewsShareReuse this content"

The show, by the Italian writer-director and his company, inhabits its own island – a long, lizard-like colony. The audience boards a shuttle and skims across the water to arrive at a building that was once a lazaretto – a hospital for leprosy patients. Associations with fatal infection and social isolation are chillingly resonance of the Covid pandemic. But as you wander into this disturbing promenade piece, things turn chilly in more ways than one.The building’s interior is stripped of its skin so that its brick and rafters lie bare, and there is a low electronic rumble of sound along its corridors which is as disquieting as the near darkness. Windows are boarded up, as if deliberately concealing activity inside. Further along, there are bags lying in empty rooms that at first look empty but which twitch with still-living and breathing bodies inside them.The suggestion is that of a torture chamber whose violence has taken place or will do so imminently. There is deepening alarm as you venture into this unaccounted, warehouse-like space, where, you imagine, more people lie gasping in body bags.View image in fullscreenNo words spoken, no explanation … The Potato Eaters or I Mangiatori di Patate.Photograph: Andrea AvezzuThe full terror of the show manifests in a bizarre and baroque scene of ritualised but unexplained tyranny, enacted through choreographed movement by an eight-strong cast (Luca Nava, Sergio Scarlatella, Laura Pante, Vito Ancona, Jacopo Franceschet, Marco Gagliardi, Vittorio Tommasi, Michela Valerio).A total blackness descends in a central room which is filled with thundering sound that barrels towards us (brilliantly, terrifyingly, designed by Scott and Oliver Gibbons). There is, for this cowering critic, the discomfiting feeling that things could turn genuinely dangerous within this rumbling darkness.Creepy images emerge out of smoke, from a giant winged creature – a deity, an extraterrestrial or a symbol of totalitarian terror reminiscent of the Third Reich? – to a slow-moving group of miners carrying pickaxes and a body unzipped from a bag, naked, blood streaked, as pale as death, who performs a kind of dance of death.There are no words spoken, no explanation for who these people are and what their cult-like rituals represent. The story is all the more ominous for its opacity. The winged creature and the miners seem to be proxies for a more dreadful, unseen, force.It is a gnomic work but full of visceral dread. The building looks neutral and unremarkable once you are outside it again but the threat stays with you as you board the boat back to the mainland, to light and safety.Until 15 June as part of theBiennale Teatro 2025.

Acid-tongued Myrtle spends her days in her overgrown yard with her husband, Melrose, grandson, Rudy, and Rudy’s “close friend” Jason. But around the patch of grass, memories seep into the present through ghosts and flickering flashes, in a jumble of certainty and doubt.That’s because, at 82, Myrtle has begun to lose her grip on reality.Taio Lawson’s inaugural production as the Bush theatre’s incoming artistic director is a full immersion into this disorienting, fragile mindscape. One moment, a scene unfolds as a naturalistic conversation; the next, the auditorium is plunged into pitch darkness, pierced by an eerie, rumbling soundscape. It’s a striking way for Lawson to make a creative entrance; but with so much happening onstage, the production tips into becoming overblown and chaotic.View image in fullscreenShame on his shoulders … Michael Ahomka-Lindsay as Rudy (front) and Elander Moore as Jason in Miss Myrtle's Garden at Bush theatre.Photograph: Camilla GreenwellAt its centre is a tour-de-force performance by Diveen Henry as Miss Myrtle. Her sardonic put-downs (“being difficult is better than being easy”) paint her as a pillar of blunt-force resilience. Her sharp quips are crisply drawn, showing King’s gift for writing rich comedy. But as the scenes roll forward, it becomes heartbreakingly clear that Myrtle’s memory is faltering and she needs help.Rudy faces a complicated future: what to do with Myrtle, and how to extract the information she guards about his dead father before time runs out. But Rudy also is keeping a secret of his own: Jason is actually his partner. Shame about who he is presses heavily on Rudy’s shoulders. Their chemistry, wonderfully encapsulated by the gentle, side-glancing performances of Michael Ahomka-Lindsay as Rudy and Elander Moore as Jason, is left to play out in the shadows. When both men move into Myrtle’s house, the weight of their unspoken love only deepens.Designer Khadija Raza builds a neat circle of grass, decorated with real flowers and soil for the action to play out on. Here, Rudy battles Myrtle for shards of the past while willing her not to vanish into the depths of dementia. Even as the script meanders, their relationship is charged with unspoken pain, sure to pull at your heartstrings.At Bush theatre until 12 JulyExplore more on these topicsStageBush theatreTheatreDementiareviewsShareReuse this content"

His lucid message here is “If we save the sea we save our world”, as he talks us through what humanity has done to the Earth’s oceans and how we can protect them. Awe and anger intermingle – there are glorious images of aquatic life, such as the remote submarine seamounts that are “pitstops” for migrating fish or the kelp forests in coastal waters that capture carbon. But it’s the underwater footage of indiscriminate dredging by trawlers that has the most emotional impact – a picture of devastation that’s also a call to arms.Simon WardellJulius Caesar (Joseph L. Mankiewicz, 1953), 2pm, BBC TwoThere aren’t many Shakespeare plays with more quotable lines than his Roman power play, from “It was Greek to me” to “Let slip the dogs of war”. And in Joseph L Mankiewicz’s slick take it’s Marlon Brando as Mark Antony who gets the best: his “I came to bury Caesar not to praise him” speech is a masterclass in rhetorical rabble-rousing. And Brando has to raise his game, what with seasoned stage stars James Mason (Brutus), Louis Calhern (Caesar) and, particularly, John Gielgud (Cassius) immersing us eloquently in portents and plots, murder and mayhem.SWLive sportMen’s International T20 Cricket: England v West Indies, 2pm, Channel 5The second match from Bristol.Men’s International Football: FA Nations League Final, 7.30pm, ITV1Portugal take on Spain at Allianz Arena, Munich.Explore more on these topicsTelevision & radioTV tonightfeaturesShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.It’s easy to be seduced by the romance of train travel. Think of sleeper trains, boat trains, vintage steam railways, elegant dining cars. But it’s rare that an urban transport system can capture the imagination quite as much as the Wuppertal Schwebebahn in Germany caught mine, and that of anyone else who’s clapped eyes on the world’s oldest suspended railway.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.In October it will be 125 years since Kaiser Wilhelm II took a test ride in the Schwebebahn, just a few months before the hanging railway officially opened for business in March 1901. It was an incredible feat of engineering then, and remains so today. Even with sleek modern carriages having long replaced the original ones, it looks like something imagined by Jules Verne, with carriages smoothly gliding under the overhead track. They have even preserved the first 1901 carriage, nicknamed Kaiserwagen, which can be hired for private occasions.As the hanging train sways above the river, it turns this commuter service into something like a fairground rideA childlike feeling of glee filled me as I sat in the rear of the long carriage and watched the city reveal itself as I floated anything from 8 to 9 metres (26ft to 39ft) above it. At the railway’s westernmost end, Vohwinkel is the first of only four stations whose carriages run above the street, between iron arches. The rest of the railway, which in total runs for just over eight miles, follows the route of the river Wupper. As the hanging train curves and sways above the serpentine river, it turns this commuter service into something like a fairground ride for its 80,000 daily passengers. My hitherto unknown train geek had been unleashed and was utterly delighted.View image in fullscreenThe Schwebebahn railway follows the route of the River Wupper.Photograph: Hackenberg-Photo-Cologne/AlamyThe Schwebebahn came about almost by accident. The Wupper valley, about 15 miles east of Düsseldorf, was a major textile production base when Germany was undergoing its own Industrial Revolution in the 19th century. As workers flooded to the growing cities of Barmen and Elberfeld – which merged in 1929 and were renamed Wuppertal in 1930 – the authorities realised a public transport system was needed. Other cities were going underground, but Wuppertal’s rocky soil and narrow, steep valley made any sort of U-Bahn impossible, forcing the Schwebebahn’s inventor, Eugen Langen, to look up instead.At Schwebodrom, the railway museum that opened in late 2023 near Werther Brücke station at the line’s eastern end, the rich history of the Schwebebahn is laid out in three galleries, revealing one fascinating detail after another. One gallery tells the story of Tuffi, a young circus elephant loaded into the Schwebebahn for a publicity stunt in 1950. Poor Tuffi was so spooked by jostling journalists that she bolted through a window and tumbled into the river. Luckily she was only lightly bruised and lived for another 49 years, her landing spot in the Wupper now marked by an elephant statue between Alter Markt and Adler Brücke stations. You can’t move in Wuppertal without seeing Tuffi on some souvenir or another – even on milk cartons.Among the museum’s films and displays, the highlight for me was the reproduction of an original carriage, where I sat glued to my VR headset and found myself in 1920s Wuppertal. After riding the rails in real life, I was able to go back in time to see what had changed. Much of Wuppertal had to be rebuilt after heavy allied bombing in the second world war, and the railway itself has been completely reconstructed – including its art nouveau stations – while keeping the original steampunk-style design in the iron girders.View image in fullscreenLaurentiusplatz, Wuppertal.Photograph: ©Adam BatterbeeBut there is a Wuppertal beyond the Schwebebahn, and this city of about 350,000 people was as full of pleasant surprises as its railway. Local guide Heike Fragemann took me to the tree-lined streets around Laurentiusplatz, a square dominated by the austere-looking 19th-century basilica of St Lawrence, dedicated to Wuppertal’s patron saint. Popular with many of the 23,000 students at the University of Wuppertal as well as people of all ages, the cosmopolitan streets hummed with cafes, delis, boutiques, bars and restaurants run by some of the many nationalities that have settled here over the decades – Italian, Turkish, Greek, Indian, Vietnamese and Spanish among them. In fact, the range of restaurants throughout the city was huge, and also included Lebanese, Chinese, Croatian and traditional German fare.Sir Simon Rattle rated the acoustics of the Historische Stadthalle concert hall among the best in the worldPointing out an example of Wuppertal’s distinctive style of architecture – slate cladding, green shutters and white window frames – Heike led me along the narrow streets behind Laurentiusplatz as we steadily walked uphill. Not only was Wuppertal Germany’s Manchester because of its industry, Heike told me, but it was also compared to San Francisco thanks to its steepness. “We are the city of steps,” she said as we came to yet another one. “We have 500 staircases, more than 12,000 steps within the city. This is the most famous one.” She pointed to a sign with the captivating name of Tippen-Tappen-Tönchen, in honour of those 19th-century workmen clopping in their wooden clogs towards the riverside factories – hence the tipping-tapping sound. One to add to my list of adorable street names.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe TravellerFree newsletterGet travel inspiration, featured trips and local tips for your next break, as well as the latest deals from Guardian HolidaysEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The Von der Heydt Museum, named after an art-collecting banking family, houses its impressive collection of 19th- and early 20th-century art in what had been the neoclassical town hall. The entrance is flanked by two large sculptures by the Liverpool-born Turner prize-winner Tony Cragg, who made Wuppertal his home in 1977. The Historische Stadthalle concert hall, marking its 125th anniversary this year, had Richard Strauss as one of its first conductors and Sir Simon Rattle rated its acoustics among the best in the world. Public gardens fill many of the gaps in the city, including the vast hilly Botanical Garden.As I sat in the warm, bookish surroundings of Café Engel in Laurentiusplatz, I was reminded of Friedrich Engels, the son of a wealthy Wuppertal textile manufacturer, who turned his back on his bourgeois background to co-author The Communist Manifesto with Karl Marx after seeing the appalling working conditions in mid-19th-century Manchester. Engels died in London six years before the Schwebebahn opened, and it was many years earlier that the city’s industrialists had already implemented social reforms for working-class residents that were ahead of their time. The Schwebebahn, too, looks like something from the future, but its story is purely of Wuppertal’s unique past.

Many other houses and vineyards allow dogs in drinking areas for tastings on terraces or inside their bars.For walks, head to Parc de Champagne in central Reims, which has beautiful landscaped gardens and wooded areas for shady strolls when the sun’s out, or drive out to theParc Naturel Régional de la Montagne de Reimsfor longer trails in the hills.Where to stayAppart’City Conforthas self-catering apartments from €70 a night (dogs must be under 30kg).Pas-de-CalaisView image in fullscreenBeach huts in dog-friendly Le Touquet in France.Photograph: Hemis/AlamyDog-friendly beaches can be hard to come by during summer in France, as dog bans come into force throughout much of the country from May until September. But you needn’t go far to find spectacular sands to share with the dog in the Pas-de-Calais, as several seaside towns along Côte d’Opale have really embraced what they are callingtoutourisme– travel designed with dogs in mind.Head an hour south of Calais to Berck, home to a wide, brilliantly bright white-sand beach where dogs are welcome on its northern and southern sections even in August. Or stop in bougie Le Touquet, 10 miles north of Berck, for wonderful walks through sand dunes that end at the dog-friendly restaurantLa Base Nordright on the Baie de Canche. The tourist offices in both towns offer welcome packs for dogs, including treats, plus maps showing walks, eateries and accommodation suitable for dogs.Where to stayA five-minute walk from the dog-friendly Plage Sainte-Cécile,Evancy Camiers-Sainte-Cécile, Trésors d’Opalehas self-catering apartments with balconies overlooking the pool from €94 a night, dogs €12 a night.Canal du MidiView image in fullscreenCruise with your canine along the Canal du Midi.Photograph: Julen Arabaolaza/Getty ImagesSpend your summer in the slow lane of France’s vast transport network and make for the Canal du Midi – a 150‑mile waterway that’s part of a system of canals and rivers that connect the Mediterranean to the Atlantic. Taking in the entire canal would be ambitious even with an entire summer break at your disposal, but hop on board your own houseboat in Trèbes and you can cruise with the dog all the way to historic Carcassonne and beyond.Alongside the old walled city, where you’ll find the medieval streets littered with dog-friendly bar and restaurant terraces, you will pass vineyards and handsome canalside communes with 13th-century churches, before reaching Castelnaudary about 25 miles (and a good few days) later. Canalside walks make for a pleasant morning routine before you spend your days sunning yourselves on the bow as you pootle along, or barbecuing on the back deck.Where to stayFour-berth houseboat fromLe Boat’s Trèbes base from €984 a week, dogs (max two) €85 a rental.PORTUGALPinhãoView image in fullscreenThere are dog-friendly boat trips available at Pinhão.Photograph: Anima DuriusThe wide, winding Douro River is flanked by mesmerisingly terraced vineyards that give this valley a unique character. In summer, the hillsides are flourishing with plump grapes on rich green vines, while in autumn a palette of oranges, reds and browns takes over, drenching the landscape in sepia tones.Whenever you visit with the dog, this is excellent walking country, and from Pinhão there are plenty of waymarked long-distance and shorter circular walks that, conveniently, happen to pass through vineyards and wineries. Between hikes, there aredog-friendly boat tours, wine tours and tastings atCroft Winery, and anolive oil museumin nearby Casal de Loivos.Where to stayThe Suite Nunesapartment has a kitchenette, its own patio and views over the terraces, from €170 a night.LisbonView image in fullscreenA sunset beach walk to the west of Lisbon.Photograph: Gabriel Mello/Getty ImagesPortugal’s capital is an urban dog walker’s paradise – as long as you don’t mind a few hills. Streets lined with pretty whitewashed homes, squares overlooked by baroque-inspired buildings painted in pastel colours, and a host ofmiradouro(viewpoints) for wonderful vistas over the city and towards the ocean make this place a visual feast, ideally explored on foot.Come in spring or early autumn for the best weather (it’s often too hot in summer for dogs unused to the heat) to ascend Miradouro de Santa Luzia to see pretty painted tiles, or Miradouro da Graça for the best sunset views. And if the city gets too much, head along the coast to Estoril and let the dog have a dip in the sea at the dog-friendly coastal area around Praia do Pescoço do Cavalo.Where to stayThe effortlessly coolSelina Secret Gardennear the Bairro Alto neighbourhood offers private, pet-friendly stays from €80 a night, dogs €12 a night.Parque Natural da Serra de São MamedeView image in fullscreenOld cork oak trees in a blooming meadow in the Serra de São Mamede.Photograph: Uwe Moser Moser/AlamyQuiet walking trails, majestic hilltop castles and vast almond and cork-oak plantations abound in this natural park in south-east Portugal. Serra de São Mamede natural park sits on the border with Spain, a world away from Lisbon and the busy Algarve coastline.Its remoteness makes it something of a mission to reach – it’s a good seven-hour drive from the nearest ferry ports in Bilbao or Santander – but once you’re there the rewards are great. This is Portuguese scenery at its best: dramatic quartzite ridges topped with fortified towns such as Marvão and Castelo do Vide; ancient oak forests teeming with wild boar and deer; and a network of prehistoric dolmen (megalithic tombs) to discover as you hike itsmany trails.Where to stayPousada Marvão, where dogs get welcome treats and dinner, has spectacular views of the valley below, from €120 a night.GERMANYBaltic coastView image in fullscreenA havanese enjoys a beach in Heringsdorf.Photograph: buchsammy/Getty ImagesWhile the beaches of southern Europe swelter throughout summer, you can count on Germany’s Baltic coast to keep you and the dog cool. There’s about 600 miles of shoreline here, but one of the most dog-friendly parts lies on the border with Poland on the handsome island of Usedom.Known for its pretty spa town villas in baroque, art nouveau and Palladian styles, the town of Heringsdorf is a great base with a seven-mile-long promenade for walking the dog, and canine-friendly sections of beaches in nearby Bansin. Fascinating military history can be found at thePeenemünde Historical Technical Museum, and there are wonderful forest walks around a lake at Wolgastsee.Where to stayPainted a regal red, and only a few minutes’ walk from the beach,Villa San Remohas one- and two-bed self-catering apartments from €59 a night.Harz mountainsView image in fullscreenDog walking in the Harz mountains.Photograph: David Ziegler/Getty ImagesSomething quite remarkable is going on in the Harz mountains, anational park115 miles south-west of Berlin. Disease, drought and invasive bark beetles have ravaged the spruce trees planted on these mountainsides after the second world war. But take the dog for a long walk from peak to peak, or around its many reservoirs, and you’ll discover a landscape that’s healing and rewilding itself. Beneath the barren, silvery trunks of dead spruce lies a forest floor flourishing with fungi and insects, while native saplings of oak, birch and willow are beginning to thrive.There aretrails aplenty, as well as dog-friendly gondolas and theHarz Railway, a steam train that trundles to the top of the park’s highest peak, the Brocken.Where to stayOn the south-west edge of the Harz mountains, theHardenberg BurgHotelis a brilliant dog-friendly base with an upmarket restaurant. Rooms from €198 a night, dogs €25 a night.SPAINCosta BravaView image in fullscreenL’Estartit beach has a dog-friendly section.Photograph: Boerescu Flaviu/AlamyIf the Atlantic is too chilly a prospect for your dog, let them dip a paw in the balmy waters of the Mediterranean on Spain’s Costa Brava. This part of the coastline has long been popular with Brits, but bringing the dog necessitates getting away from the crowds.The dog-friendly section of beach in L’Estartit is a good mile-long walk from the main stretch in town, and it’s all the quieter for it. Expect soft sand underfoot and a gently sloping beach that’s lapped by calm seas, with views out to the small but striking Illes Medes archipelago.Other dog-friendly stretches of sand abound, including Platja del Rec in L’Escala and a quiet shingle cove in Port de la Selva.Where to staySet on top of hills above the Med in Begur,Hostal Sa Rascassais a homely dog-friendly base with rooms from €125 a night.ValenciaView image in fullscreenThere’s a year round dog-friendly area at the northern end of Playa de Pinedo.Photograph: Lunamarina/Getty ImagesThis coastal city in the east of Spain has several stretches of soft sand for running about with a ball or paddling in the Mediterranean, all of which are dog-friendly outside the main summer season (from June to the end of September), with a year-round dog section at the northern end of Playa de Pinedo.It’s not just about the seaside here, though: the Jardín del Turia is a vast, green artery running through the centre of Valencia, with 136 hectares for dogs to enjoy a sniff about in town, with several enclosed socialisation dog parks and even an agility area. From here, you need only walk 10 minutes into the old town to find dog-friendly bars and terraces for a refreshing sangria.Colmado LaLolawelcomes dogs inside and out, and serves beautifully fresh tapas.Where to stayJust a few minutes’ walk from the Jardín del Turia,Hotel Ad Hoc Carmenallows dogs for city-centre stays.

For dog owners, many of these are off limits, but fortunately fantastic food is still on offer in the hundreds of pintxos bars throughout the old and new towns. Most won’t blink an eye if you rock up with your dog on a lead, perhaps after a thigh-burning walk up Monte Urgull (or on the beaches if it’s outside the main bathing season).Eat sea urchins at Casa Vergara, grilled octopus atLa Taberna del Pícaro, or go toBorda Berrifor the smoky pork rib (kebab de costilla de cerdo).

Described by the Liverpool Daily Post in 1962 as “roast chicken Indian fashion”, this delicately seasoned, but often luridly coloured, dish was once the mainstay of the British Indian restaurant menu; yet, always greedy for novelty, I can’t remember when I last had the pleasure.The loss is mine, because it’s one of the very best ways to eat chicken – rich and tender, thanks to its yoghurt marinade, tangy with lemon and perfumed with spice.Vivek Singh arguesthat “no Punjabi celebration can be complete without tandoori chicken”, while J Inder Singh Kalra went as far as to crown it the“king of kebabs”, a sentiment echoed by Rohit Ghai.The issue for domestic cooks is, of course, that few of us have the clay oven, ortandoor, from which the dish takes its name. Traditionally used to cook bread, and capable of getting up to astonishingly high temperatures, it’s this that gives tandoori chicken its characteristically smoky flavour. So, assuming you don’t happen to have one handy, what’s the best way to make tandoori-style chicken at home?The chickenTandoori chicken is usually a whole bird cut into pieces and threaded on to skewers, ready to be lowered into the oven – using boneless chicken pieces instead, as newly crowned Fortnum & Mason cookery writer of the yearRavinder Bhogal notesin these very pages, will get “dinner on the table faster” (she suggests using thigh for tikka, which I’d echo, because it stays much juicier).View image in fullscreenNik Sharma uses drumsticks to make his tandoori chicken. All thumbnails by Felicity Cloake.Most recipes specify either a whole bird or an assortment of joints –drumsticks for Nik Sharma,legs and breasts for Madhur Jaffrey– but because they’re for the most part all cut into pieces, you can adapt this to suit your own preference, with the caveat that I wouldn’t recommend using just breast, because it does dry out very easily. A mixture, or legs alone, is a far better bet.Both Bhogal and Singh spatchcock the whole bird, splaying it out so it cooks more evenly. This looks impressive, but I’ve decided to stick with pieces only, not least because of the risk of overcooking the white meat; this way, it’s easy to whip out the breasts and leave in the legs for a few minutes longer.Tandoori chicken is almost always skinless – only Ghai and those cooking whole birds (Bhogal andRoopa Gulati) don’t mention removing it – because it gives the marinade better access to the meat. The yoghurty coating will play a similar protective role, insulating the flesh from direct heat, while a couple of deep slashes will bring the marinade, and its flavour, into the centre of the meat.The marinadeThe consensus breaks down when it comes to the marinade. Sharma, Bhogal and Sarah Woods’s lovely bookDesi Kitchenall use a single marinade, whileRick Stein’s India, Inder Singh Kalra’sPrashad, Ghai’sYatra,Keith Floyd’s India,Jaffrey’s Indian Cookeryand Gulati’sCurry Loversemploy a two-step process in which the meat is first rubbed with citrus juice or vinegar, salt and sometimes a few aromatics (ginger and garlic paste for Ghai; turmeric, chilli and pepper for Gulati) and left for half an hour or so before the yoghurt mix is added.View image in fullscreenRoopa Gulati covers the whole bird in a white-wine vinegar marinade.And this extra step seems well worth it, because, the spices aside, lemon (you could use lime or Gulati’s white-wine vinegar instead, if you prefer) and salt seem to me the top notes of every tandoori chicken I can remember eating. Salt is the only molecule that is small enough here realistically topenetrate into the interior, but the rest will season the outside well enough to flavour every bite regardless (most British chicken is young enough that tenderness ought not to be an issue).The dairy marinade, which contains fat that will dissolve the aromatics in the spices, so they coat the meat thoroughly, will stay largely on the surface of the chicken, as a kind of integral sauce. The thicker the yoghurt, the more easily it will stick, so a greek-style thick one is ideal. You could also add pureed red onion, as Sharma does, or Jaffrey’s yellow onion. Green chillies are also popular, as is chilli powder (whether readymade or ground from dried Kashmiri chillies). Cumin is near ubiquitous; peppercorns, fenugreek and turmeric pop up a lot, as do sweeter spices such as green cardamom and cloves – I particularly enjoy Bhogal’s luxurious cinnamon and saffron, for example.That said, I want to keep my recipe fairly simple, because my testers and I all enjoy Jaffrey’s tandoori chicken, spiced with fresh green chilli, garam masala and paprika, so much, which proves you don’t need a kaleidoscope of spices to make your own. That’s why I’ve stuck with garam masala (which, in India, usually includes cumin, coriander, cinnamon, cardamom, cloves and peppercorns) plus a little extra cumin, though you may well want to add other spices that take your fancy. (Saffron comes highly recommended, both for its elusive fragrance and the colour it lends.)View image in fullscreenMadhur Jaffrey marinades her chicken pieces for as long as 24 hours, which seems a bit excessive.Time-wise, and though I hate to disagree with Jaffrey, I don’t think “the longer, the better” applies here. After her recommended 24 hours in the marinade, the surface of the chicken is a little bit mushy, so four to six hours feels like the sweet spot. Possibly chickens were tougher back in 1982?The colourThe tandoori chicken I grew up on got what Mallika Basu describesin her book Masalaas its “characteristic Day-Glo red appearance from a dash of artificial colour, but”, she adds, “Kashmiri chilli powder or paprika is more commonly used at home”. Sharma suggests adding some beetroot, “which does work very well without affecting the taste, though I will admit, I wish it were a deeper shade of red. However, too much beet could also end up sweetening the chicken, which is something I wanted to avoid”.Stein uses beetroot powder instead, which can be found at specialist spice retailers (I bought some from Spice Mountain at London’s Borough Market,which also sells online), but I think you get just as good a result from Jaffrey’s paprika rub. Alternatively, if it just doesn’t feel like tandoori chicken if it doesn’t glow in the dark, use an artificial colouring; if you don’t worry about eating it in cakes and sweets, it feels illogical to avoid it here (Dan Toombs notes that, contrary to packet instructions, you shouldrub the colouring directly on to the meat).View image in fullscreenFelicity Cloake’s perfect tandoori chicken, as cooked on a barbecue …The cookingJaffrey excitedly reports that, “I have, I think, found a way to make tandoor-style chicken without a tandoor!” which, “as I am sure you all know by now, is a vat-shaped clay oven, heated with charcoal or wood. The heat inside builds up to such an extent that small whole chickens, skewered and thrust into it, cook in about 10 minutes. The fierce heat seals the juices of the bird and keeps it moist … the result is quite spectacular.” Her home solution is an oven heated to its maximum temperature: “The cooking time is not 10 minutes, because home ovens do not get as hot as tandoors. Still, breasts cook in 15 or 20 minutes and legs in 20 to 25 minutes.”View image in fullscreenFelicity Cloake’s perfect tandoori chicken fresh from the oven.Sharma also uses the oven, though at a mere 200C, then finishes off the drumsticks under the grill. Ghai’s book Yatra uses a hot grill alone (time to switch on that extractor fan), while Singh and Bhogal prefer the barbecue, which is, in my opinion, the ideal scenario for a slightly smoky flavour. If that’s not practical, a very hot oven is the next best thing, though I’d advise you to check on the breasts towards the end of the cooking time, and take them out early, if necessary. Bhogal’s drizzle of ghee, while to some extent gilding the lily, helps to stop the chicken drying out while it rests (she also finishes the dish with a sprinkle of chaat masala).Honourable mention goes to Gulati’s whole tandoori chicken. Smothered in marinade, stuffed with buttery rice and roasted whole, it’s utterly delicious if you’re looking for a less traditional take on the classic. It’s one that I will certainly make again.The extrasBhoghal gives recipes for coriander and mint chutney, kachumber salad and garlic naan, all of which work very well with tandoori chicken, as do basmati rice and, indeed, a masala gravy.View image in fullscreenRavinder Bhogal serves her tandoori chicken with a coriander and mint chutney.Alternatively, you might prefer shredded iceberg, some lemon wedges and a pint of Kingfisher on the side: entirely up to you. (It would be remiss of me not to inform you that any leftovers make excellent sandwiches – or, like Sharma, you might prefer to freeze some of it after two hours of marinating.)Perfect tandoori chicken (without a tandoor)Prep15 minMarinate4½-6½ hrCook25 minServes46 chicken pieces– 2 bone-in thighs, 2 drumsticks, 2 breasts, all skinless6 garlic cloves, peeled1 tbsp grated ginger1-1½ tsp salt6 tbsp lemon or lime juice, or white-wine vinegar1 tsp cumin seeds2 green chillies250g thick, greek-style plain yoghurt4 tsp garam masalaBlack pepper2 tbsp sweet paprika, or 1 tbsp mild chilli powder2 tbsp gheeor oilView image in fullscreenTake the skin off the chicken, if necessary, then cut the legs and breasts into two pieces each, then cut a couple of deep slashes in each piece.View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenPeel the ginger and garlic, then mash both to a paste with the salt (adjust to your taste) in a mortar or mini chopper, then stir in the lemon juice. Rub this mix all over the chicken, cover and leave for 30 minutes.View image in fullscreenMeanwhile, toast the cumin seeds in a dry pan until aromatic, then crush to a powder. Finely chop the chilli and mash to a paste – I add it to the mortar with the cumin. Stir both into the yoghurt, then mix in the garam masala and a good grind of black pepper.Smear the paprika all over the chicken, followed by the yoghurt, making sure to get this as far into the cuts as possible, then cover and chill for four to six hours. Take the chicken out of the fridge half an hour before you want to start cooking it.View image in fullscreenLight the barbecue or heat the oven to 240C (230C fan)/475F/gas 9 (or as high as it will go). Once the barbecue or oven is ready (the barbecue coals should be glowing white hot, and no flames should be visible), grease the barbecue grill or a baking tray with ghee or oil, then lay on the chicken pieces, shaking off any excess marinade back into the bowl.View image in fullscreenGrill or roast for 15 minutes, then brush all over with the extra marinade and turn over the chicken pieces. Cook for 10-15 minutes longer, or until cooked through and beginning to char; check on the breasts after 10 minutes, just to be on the safe side.Take off the grill/out of the oven, brush all over with the remaining ghee, if using, and leave to rest for 10-15 minutes before serving.Tandoori chicken – is it indeed the king of kebabs (even if you don’t use a skewer), and is there any point in making it without the eponymous clay oven?

No, stop!Grace DentSun 8 Jun 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 8 Jun 2025 01.14 EDTShareOne undeniable fact about Angelina, which has just openeda second sitein Spitalfields, east London, is that in the now mini-group’s relatively short existence, they’ve singlehandedly made the phrase “Italian-Japanese restaurant” seem a much more normal thing to say. Patently,Angelina Mark 1over in Dalston was not the first time in culinary history that Milan met Tokyo over the stoves, that miso met pasta, that truffle met sushi, and so on; hungry people have always travelled, merged cuisines and messed about with flavours. Still, the original Angelina’skaiseki-style tasting menu, wherechawanmushi(savoury egg custard) is served with datterini tomatoes, and pastas are topped withfurikake, was clearly interesting enough to attract theattention of Michelin.Its new sister, Osteria Angelina, is darkly chic, spacious (handy for group dining) and tucked away down a side road onthe Norton Folgate developmentclose to Shoreditch overground station (fans of the Sri Lankan restaurantKolombaon Kingly Street near Oxford Circus will find a second outpost,Kolomba East, in the same area, andNoisy Oyster, from the people behindFirebird, will soon be joining them). To give credit where its due, Norton Folgate is a refreshingly beautiful restoration project, where spruced-up Edwardian, Georgian and Victorian buildings mix with new-builds to create a little slice of sedate elegance away from the bottomless brunch,Box Park hellscapethat is modern Shoreditch. Escape the main drag, hop into Osteria Angelina, sit up at the marble bar in front of the open kitchen and order snacks of pizza nera topped withmoromi, a rich fermented soy paste, or a salad of zucchini and shiso leaves with ricotta.View image in fullscreen‘Hot as hell and generously stuffed’: Osteria Angelina’s fried courgette flowers with miso ricotta.From the number of people eating here just two weeks after it opened, this cultural clash clearly has its fans. What Osteria Angelina’s Japanese customers, with their relatively orderly rules of social conduct and deference, make of the place’s excessively animated Italian servers, however, is one for the anthropology books. All this, I guess, is smoothed over by the likes of the nori-topped focaccia and the small, sweet mini-loaf of Hokkaido milk bread, the very memory of which has me salivating; that’s served with a kumquat reduction – OK, let’s call it jam – and a puddle of burnt honey butter.After thepaneandinsalatesections, the menu moves on tofrittiandcrudo. We ordered a plate of hot-as-hell tempura’d courgette flowers stuffed generously with miso ricotta. Crudo is so often a disappointment, but here the bream is cured in kombu and doused in yet more burnt butter, making it rather wickedly appealing. Hamachi sashimi was also very good, and smothered in truffled soy and furikake.View image in fullscreenOsteria Angelina’s ‘immensely comforting’ fazzoletti with duck ragu and lotus.Dinner here could easily be made up purely of a collection of these small plates and some bread to mop up the exquisite oils, but that would mean missing out on the freshagnolottiand tortellini. The pasta offering changes frequently, but expect the likes of immensely comforting fazzoletti with a rich duck ragu and lotus, crab and sausage-filled agnolotti and whelk risotto with burnt soy butter.Larger meaty and fishy things, meanwhile, are grilled in front of you onbinchō-tancoals behind the bar. Tongue with wasabi, anyone? Or, more simply, some Brixham skate wing or a Blythburgh pork chop? Angus steak comes rare, drenched in miso butter, alongside our side order ofNamaYasaigreens and an extra portion oftsukemonopickles.There’s a lot to adore about all of this cooking; it’s generous, oily, saucy and certainly not to be eaten every day. Every plate we tried swam in some variation on spiced, seasoned, miso-flecked oil that would have been a terrible waste to consign to the dishwasher. How about some more bread and the remnants of that house ponzu? Wait, they’re taking away the delicious white balsamic dressing that came with the tempura agretti? No, stop!View image in fullscreen‘Dark, gloomy, stodgy’: Osteria Angelina’s brulee black sesame cheesecake with milk gelato.In fact, the only thing that left me slightly cold, other than the damned uncomfortable chairs with backrests so far back that you’re almost lying down, was the brulee’d black sesame cheesecake with milk ice-cream, which, though visually interesting – dark, gloomy, stodgy – had about it the air of something that had been mass-produced, in much the same way as a Pizza Express cheesecake probably wasn’t made by chef’s nonna that morning, but rather came out of a packet from the freezer. Next time – and there will be a next time – I’ll go for thegenmaicha purinandkinakogreen tea rice pudding.Osteria Angelina shouldn’t work, but it absolutely does.
